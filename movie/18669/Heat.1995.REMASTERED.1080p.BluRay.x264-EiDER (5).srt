Bang. Bang. Bang, bang, bang.

136
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,236
他側身倒下
To his side.

137
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:32,283
這人看來似乎是胸部中了兩槍
This guy here has got what appears to be a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

138
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,244
從頭的傷勢，燒焦的骨頭看來 是近距離被殺
Tattooing around the head wound, scorched bone, close range.

139
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,871
應該是一槍斃命
Probably executed.

140
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,086
160萬的債券被盜，他們沒拿走現金
And it was a million six in bearer bonds, and they ignored the loose cash.

141
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,963
因為他們沒時間，他們有計時
Because they had no time, because they were on a clock.

142
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,925
這代表他們知道警方何時會到達
Which means they knew our response time to a 2-11...

143
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:52,303
聽警方廣播，把車截停、進入
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

144
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,889
逃走，全在三分鐘內搞定
...escaped in under three minutes.

145
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,684
這是好地點，有很好的逃走路線
It's a good spot here. We got good escape routes.

146
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,438
- 在四分之一哩之內有兩條公路 - 交通監視器呢？
- Two freeways within a quarter of a mile. - Traffic video camera?

147
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,607
可能被破壞了，但還是查一下
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

148
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,275
你認出手法了嗎？
You recognize the M.O.?

149
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,195
手法就是他們很厲害
M.O. is that they're good.

150
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,198
當他們殺了兩個警衛
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all of them...

151
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,451
犯了一級謀殺罪後，便不再遲疑
...after they killed the first two guards, they didn't hesitate...

152
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,497
殺了第三名，因為··· 反正沒有差別
...popped guard number three because what difference does it make?

153
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,416
為何留活口？
Why leave a living witness?

154
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,877
在危機時刻，這些人亳不遲疑
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock 'n' roll.

155
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,298
錐孔裝藥
The shape charge.

156
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:33,219
顯示劫匪的技術是純熟的
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.

157
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,304
純熟到他們能在運送途中出手
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

158
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,100
從最近幾宗大竊盜懸案開始查起
So let's start looking for recent high-line burglaries that have mystified us.

159
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,436
查聯邦調查局檔案有「滑頭」這綽號的
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

160
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,771
名單可能很長，但還是要查
You're gonna get the phone book. Do it anyway.

161
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,941
誰負責脫手債券？
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

162
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:50,653
查慣常收贓者 你和我查庫蘇馬諾和陶瑞納
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.

163
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,532
我要你查高斯汀及阿法洛 和監識科緊密合作
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro. Hang in with Forensics.

164
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,493
向炸彈組查問用的是什麼炸藥
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

165
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,580
要是幸運是罕見的，可追查發售來源
If we're lucky, it's exotic. We can trace the sale.

166
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,417
你別亂摸那男人的口袋，瑞秋
Get your hand out of that man's pocket, Rachel.

167
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,668
喔，文森
Oh, Vince.

168
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,969
有誰要吃派嗎？
Want some pie?

169
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,272
我去上廁所
Gotta go to the john.

170
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:00,723
他作勢攻擊，我得先下手為強
Look, I had to get it on, man. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

171
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,907
他那份在車上，由我們先均分
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

172
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,910
把他的那份都給他
...to make up for his full end.

173
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,580
因為我想立即分贓並打發這雜種
Because I wanna pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

174
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,748
好
Okay.

175
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,038
等等！
Hold it!

176
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,760
嘿
Hey.

177
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,848
- 其餘的錢呢？ - 我們遲到了
- Where's the rest? - We're late.

178
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,061
你打扮得這麼漂亮 我想在這裏和你做愛
Ooh, you look too good to go out. I could just jump you right here.

179
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,733
- 錢呢？ - 給組頭了
- Where is it? - Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

180
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,320
幾天後還會有錢，放心吧 我們真的遲到了
There's more in a couple days, so don't sweat it. We really are late.

181
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,615
得了吧，你肯定是說笑
Yeah, come on, you gotta be kidding me.

182
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,120
親愛的，為區區八千元
Honey, it ain't worth the risks you take for 8000.

183
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,123
值得冒這個險嗎？
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

184
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,625
走吧，拿你的外套
Let's go. Get your coat.

185
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,047
跟你說沒用，你心智尚未成熟
There is no point talking to you. All you are is a child growing older.

186
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,549
什麼意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

187
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,886
意思是我們不像其他成年人那樣在進步 過該過的生活
It means we're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

188
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,305
因為我嫁給了一個不聽我說話的賭徒
I'm married to a gambling junkie who won't listen.

189
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,141
夏琳，快上車吧
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

190
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,228
我怎麼能夠這樣下去？
What am I doing in this rat-bastard situation?

191
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,732
你可以不用！你要我怎樣？ 你離開這裏時，把銀行存摺和車鑰匙
You're not! What do you want from me? Leave the bankbook and car keys...

192
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,110
留在廚房，我們到底要不要去 還是我一個人去？
...in the kitchen on your way out. Are we going, or am I going alone?

193
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,779
那些垃圾你可以留著 我會帶多明尼克走
You could keep that other crap but Dominick would go with me.

194
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,491
你休想···
Don't you even think about...

195
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,602
告訴我亞伯特陶瑞納回電話了
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

196
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,981
- 亞伯特陶瑞納有打給文森嗎？ - 沒有
- Albert Torena call Vincent? - No.

197
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,484
沒有，報告出來了
No. Report came in.

198
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,820
炸藥是戴尼克斯 在拆屋時用的線性聚能炸藥
The explosive was Dynex, linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

199
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:28,991
只要駕照，就可在內華達 亞利桑那、新墨西哥州買到
You can pick it up with a driver's license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

200
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,496
- 太普通，難以追查來源，文森 - 太好了
- Too common to trace a sale, Vincent. - Oh, that's wonderful.

201
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,642
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

202
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,353
怎麼了？你去了哪裏？
What happened? Where you been?

203
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:58,687
工作
Work.

204
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,149
蘿倫的父親有來嗎？
Lauren's dad show up?

205
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,905
沒打電話，沒出現，我們等你到十點半
Didn't call, didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

206
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:13,244
這人知道他女兒過得怎樣嗎？
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with his kid?

207
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,831
我不知道
I don't know.

208
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,874
該死的混蛋
Fucking jerk.

209
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,877
那她沒事吧？
Well, is she okay?

210
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,880
她整天在房間裏
She's been in her room all day.

211
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,217
所以她有事，我也不開心
So no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

212
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:33,639
我為我們做了晚餐，四個小時前
Uh, I made dinner for us, four hours ago. Um...

213
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:38,853
每次我設法替我們保持一貫的情緒 你就會退卻
Every time I try to maintain a consistent mood between us, you withdraw.

214
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:45,568
在威尼斯大道旁邊躺著三名死人 賈絲汀
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

215
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,403
對不起
I'm sorry...

216
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,740
如果那可惡的雞
...if the goddamn chicken...

217
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,535
煮過了頭

220

231
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,342
你為何對我看什麼書這麼感興趣？
Lady, why are you so interested in what I read or what I do?

232
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,515
我在店中看過你

00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,552
你呢？
What about you?

265
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,306
- 我住在這樓上 - 你真會說笑
- I live up here. - That's very funny.

266
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,687
你的家人最早從哪裏來的？
So where's your family from originally?

267
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,147
嗯···
Um...

268
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,900
他們是蘇格蘭及愛爾蘭裔
I'm Scotch-Irish.

269
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,532
1700年末期移居到美國阿帕拉契
They, um, emigrated to Appalachia in the late 1700s.

270
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,159
你從哪裏來的？
Where are you from?

271
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,495
舊金山灣區
The Bay Area.

272
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,289
家人在那裏？
Are your folks there?

273
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:16,004
母親很久前死了，我父親··· 我不知道他在哪裏
Uh, my mother died a long time ago, and my father, I don't know where he is.

274
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,714
我有個兄弟在某處
Got a brother somewhere.

275
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,014
我猜你跟家人的關係很緊密吧？
You have a tight family. I can tell.

276
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,016
- 是 - 我就知道
- Yep. - Right?

277
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,018
你說對了
You're right.

278
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,735
是啊···
Yeah...

279
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,488
燈火通明的城市
City of lights.

280
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:50,456
在斐濟，有一種會發光的海藻 每年浮出水面一次
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae. They come out once a year in the water.

281
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,417
就像這樣
That's what it looks like out there.

282
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,420
你去過斐濟？
You been there?

283
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,881
沒有，但我終有一天會去
No, I'm going there someday.

284
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,341
是嗎？
Oh, yeah?

285
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,183
你常旅遊？
You travel a lot?

286
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,314
- 是的 - 旅遊使你寂寞？
- Yeah. - Traveling makes you lonely?

287
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,615
我一個人，可是我並不寂寞
I... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

288
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,492
你呢？
You?

289
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,411
很寂寞
I get lonely.

290
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,579
亞伯特！
Albert!

291
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,541
- 該死 - 亞伯特
- Shit. - Albert.

292
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,668
文森，你為何來這裏？
Vincent, what you doing coming here, man?

293
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,211
你瘋了嗎？這裏不是迪士尼樂園
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

294
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:48,008
你昨晚該回我電話的，亞伯特 你去了哪裏？
You were supposed to get back to me last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

295
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:52,262
- 我無法脫身，文森 - 我們侵犯他的民權吧
- I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know. - Let's violate his ass right now.

296
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,558
我幫忙你，你卻不幫我，是這樣嗎？
I do for you, you don't do for me, is that it?

297
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,561
文森，我發誓我整晚在外面
Vincent, man, I swear, I was out all night, man.

298
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,064
為你刺探消息
I'm hitting like one of them flamingo-matador guys.

299
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,358
那和我有什麼關係
Flamingo? That's got nothing to do with me.

300
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,944
我不留痕跡，努力為你找線索
I was cutting it real smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you.

301
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,489
- 你也知道我很圓滑 - 你胡說
- I'm a dancer, man. You know. - Bullshit.

302
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:13,075
我傳呼你一整天，我討厭這樣做
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand paging.

303
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,827
你這毒蟲？又吸食安非他命了？
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

304
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,914
我有濫用藥物的問題，有點同情心吧
Where is your empathy, brother? It's a substance-abuse problem.

305
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,374
同情心是昨天
Empathy was yesterday.

306
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,501
今天你在浪費我的時間
Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

307
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,836
- 文森，聽著 - 你墜入愛河了嗎？
- Vincent, man, look... - Did you fall in love?

308
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,423
告訴我，你昨晚是不是墜入愛河 所以去了別處？
Come on. Did you fall in love last night and you went off somewhere?

309
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,926
- 文森 - 只要告訴我，我會接受這解釋
- Vincent... - Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.

310
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,762
- 我會相信 - 文森
- I'll buy that. - Vincent.

311
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,055
告訴我你所知道的
Give me all you got!

312
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,224
- 文森 - 告訴我你所知道的！
- Vincent... - Give me all you got!

313
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,228
我發誓，我兄弟李察會跟你說
I swear, man, my brother, man. My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

314
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,105
我聽到他說「李察」？
I heard "Richard"?

315
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,399
- 他會告訴你 - 李察？
- He's gonna talk to you. - Richard?

316
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,900
- 李察 - 李察
- Richard. - Richard.

317
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:50,112
- 他今晚會見你，我發誓 - 他現在不在這裏？
- He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight. - He's not here, is he?

318
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,615
- 不在，他今晚會見你 - 今晚？現在不行嗎？
- No, he's gonna meet you tonight. - Tonight? What happened to now?

319
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,577
我懇求他，因為我知道你今早會到來
I... I... I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

320
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,871
- 胡說 - 不，我發誓
- This is a bunch of bullshit. - No, no, I swear.

321
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,749
他說早上不行， 因為他在鳳凰城
He said no because he in Phoenix.

322
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,770
- 啊 - 我發誓，今晚是我僅能做到的
- Ahh. - But this, man, I swear... I swear, man.

323
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,378
我到了鳳凰城後
By the time I get to Phoenix,

324
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,131
他會起程
He'll be risin',

325
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:13,385
可能留下字條，貼在門上
He'll probably leave a note right on the door.

326
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,762
我盡力了，今晚
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

327
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:22,060
他會和你在阿瓦拉多街的 B J 餐廳見面
You know? He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

328
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,563
凌晨二點，去那裏
...at 2 a.m. Be there.

329
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,148
你也要到
You be there too.

330
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,192
文森，我不行，我有事要辦，文森
Vincent, I can't be there, man. I got things to do, Vincent.

331
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,821
- 我有事辦，要到別處去 - 聽好
- I got things to do, places to be. I got... - Hey, hey, hey.

332
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,157
你要去
Be there.

333
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,874
不要浪費我的時間！
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

334
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,879
是什麼買賣？
What is it?

335
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,673
是銀行
It's a bank.

336
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:55,135
他們星期四會存錢，以便分發給各分行
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

337
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,345
讓他們星期五可以支付薪水的支票
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

338
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,682
所以星期四，總行總是放滿現鈔
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

339
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,518
- 在途中下手還是搶劫銀行？ - 銀行，由正門進入
- On the prowl or strong? - Strong. Through the front door.

340
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,520
有多少人？
How many guys?

341
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,690
連司機四人，走進銀行，得手便走
Four, or three plus a driver. Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

342
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,233
你要先拿十萬
And you want a 100,000 advance...

343
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,694
事成後分一成？
...against a 10-percent cut for that?

344
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,156
聽起來像西部牛仔搶劫銀行 他們按警鈴後
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score. They hit the holdup alarms...

345
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,034
我得在警察來臨之前離去，這算什麼？
...I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?

346
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,578
他們會按三個警鈴
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

347
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:23,872
兩個透過電話，一個是無線
Two telco and a cellular.

348
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,668
但訊號無法傳送出去，因為
See, but the signals aren't going anywhere because...

349
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:34,674
你潛進銀行，破壞警報系統的電腦
See, the night before, you cut in and trick out the alarm-system computer...

350
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:40,430
使電腦及錄影裝置 在你下手的前20分鐘關掉
...to turn itself and the video recorders off 20 minutes before you walk in the door.

351
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,141
你有建築及電子藍圖？
Architectural, electrical-engineering plans?

352
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:47,562
我都有，圖表、電腦板已經建造好 直接連接到中央處理器
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards already built. They go straight into the CPU.

353
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,565
估計會有多少錢？
What's the estimate?

354
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:56,530
1210萬到1220萬
12.1, 12.2 million.

355
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,534
我參加
You're on.

356
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,744
恭喜
Congratulations.

357
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:06,873
讓我告訴你，我如何估計錢的總數 這是我印出來的
And to give you a little idea of where my estimates come from, this is a printout...

358
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,459
沒人知道貨是你的
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

359
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:13,129
就算如此，照我說的話 保險會全數賠償
Be that as it may, my way you get 100 percent from the insurance company...

360
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,966
以六成價向我們把債券買回
...and take the bonds from us at 60 cents on the dollar...

361
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,218
你可以多賺四成
...and make yourself another 40 percent.

362
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,764
你完全沒有損失，我們大家都受益
Your operation doesn't skip a beat. Everybody makes out.

363
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:25,433
好，成交
Sure, you got a deal.

364
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:29,312
很好，因為如果有一方不高興 那就無利潤可言
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

365
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,108
讓你的人給我打電話，安排會面
Yeah, so you have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

366
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,651
好，很好
Yeah, okay.

367
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,486
很高興和你通電話
Nice talking to you.

368
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,114
你要和他們交易？
You gonna deal with these guys?

369
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:42,284
現在江湖上認為我的東西可以偷
So word's out on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

370
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,120
我會殺了這幫渾蛋
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

371
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,582
叫哈利給我加納利群島的電子試算表
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Islands' offshore.

372
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:56,047
就像我說的，這些不是估計 是實在數宇
That's not really an estimate. Those are exact figures.

373
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,509
我印出銀行過去兩個月的現金賬
I have a printout of the, uh, cash flow of the bank for the past two months.

374
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,304
- 資料怎麼得來的？ - 送上門的
- How'd you get this information? - Just comes to you.

375
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,306
資料俯拾皆是
This stuff just flies through the air.

376
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,475
他們到處傳送資料
They send information out and it's beamed out all over the place.

377
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,979
只需加以掌握便行，我懂得如何掌握
All you have to do is know how to grab it. See, I know how to grab it.

378
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,947
這是我們要的，1390萬
Um... Okay, here we go. Thirteen-point-nine million.

379
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,577
- 我接了 - 很好
- I bought it. - Good.

380
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,537
我沒說錯吧？
What did I tell you?

381
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,417
拿著
Here.

382
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,838
他同意了，聯絡凡贊，向他收錢吧
We're on. Call Van Zant, collect the money.

383
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,926
- 他怎樣？ - 他是生意人
- How is he? - He's a businessman.

384
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,887
好
Okay.

385
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,249
- 說「酪梨」 - 酪梨
- Avocado. - Avocado.

386
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,420
- 喂？ - 是，喂
- Hello? - Yeah, hello.

387
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:19,881
克裏斯在我家
Chris is at my place.

388
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:26,680
- 怎麼了？ - 夫妻爭吵
- What's wrong? - Husband-and-wife stuff.

389
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,724
我讓他睡醒再說
I'll let him sleep it off here.

390
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,281
你怎麼了？
What happened to you?

391

393
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,339
為什麼？
Why?

394
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,094
我無法好好養她
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

395
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,347
我們做這麼多買賣還不夠？
With everything we've been doing?

396
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,351
賭場及超級杯使我身無分文
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

她有外遇嗎？
She got something else on the side?

我不知道你在做什麼
I don't know what you're doing.

404
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,878
你記得監獄的吉米馬克溫常說的嗎？
Remember Jimmy MacAwain on the yard used to say:

405
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,963
「你想在江湖混嗎？
You wanna be making moves on the street?

406
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,133
要無牽掛，生活中不能有牽絆
Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life...

407
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,719
可以隨時一走了之
...that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat...

408
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,346
一旦感到風頭不對時」
...if you spot the heat around the corner.

409
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,057
記得嗎？
Remember that?

410
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,816
她是我這人生中最重要的東西
For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man.

411
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,235
是嗎？
Yeah?

...then I drop our deposit on Kelso for this bank.

416
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,670
銀行？什麼銀行？
Bank? What bank?

417

What about the platinum thing? It's ready to fall.

那也會進行，然後再搶銀行
That goes too, then the bank.

419
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,766
- 要吃早餐嗎？ - 好
- You want some breakfast? - Yeah.

420
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,690
你沒事吧？

他是一個行動主義者
He's a big fiend for action.

491
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:05,364

Now, if he'd have said nothing, I'd have thought nothing...

492
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:09,243
他一直說，不斷地對我說他什麼也沒做
...but he goes on and on, running down to me how he ain't been doing nothing...

493
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:12,079

...and nothing's been going on, and all this bullshit.

我告訴你，這滑頭不是鬧著玩的
I'm telling you, this Slick is no joke.

504
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,582
你懂我說的嗎？
You know what I'm saying?

505
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,501
- 什麼？你說什麼？ - 什麼？
- Say what? Say what? - What?

506
00:47:58,669 --> 00:48:03,589
- 你說「滑頭」，那是什麼意思？ - 他常叫別人「滑頭」
- You said, "Slick". What does that mean? - Slick. That's what he calls people, "Slick".

把他的事告訴我

告訴特別調查組我要完全監控
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.

520
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,845
24小時，日夜不停監視
That's 24 hours. Round the clock, day and night.

521
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:55,099
從不停歇，一周七日，不斷監視跟蹤他 監聽他的汽車和房子、工作地點
We never close. Open seven days a week. Bug the car, the house, the work.

522
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,351
一舉一動，例如和誰進餐
When he moves or sits, like in a restaurant...

523
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:59,812
我要所有和他有互動的人的照片
...I want pictures of who he moves and sits with.

524
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,858
調查他們，如果有案底便跟蹤他們 看他們跟誰混
Then run makes on them. They got jackets, I wanna see who they move and sit with.

525
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:06,527
我要明晚前開始執行
I want it up and running by tomorrow night.

526
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,085
- 把手放在我看得到的地方 - 什麼？
- Put your hands where I can see them. - What?

527
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:07,254
- 把手放在我看得到的地方 - 好
- Put your hands where I can see them. - All right.

528
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:11,050
我會告訴你做什麼以及怎樣去做
I tell you what to do, I tell you how to do it.

529
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:15,763
現在，只用你的右手，只准右手
Now, with your right hand only, your right hand only...

530
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:19,433
把包裹拿出來，仍過來
...take the package and throw it in here.

531
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,953
該死，你右邊後面有人
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.

532
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,618
羅傑凡贊嗎？
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?

533
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:03,746
- 是，你是誰？ - 你知道我是誰
- Yeah, who's this? - You know who this is.

534
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,290
是，我知道
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

535
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:11,045
我派人送包裹，他沒來電話 一切都好吧？
I sent a guy to deliver the package. He didn't call. Is everything right?

536
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:14,340
我告訴你，忘了那筆錢
Tell you what, forget the money.

537
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:18,385
- 什麼？ - 忘了那筆錢
- What? - Forget the money.

538
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,262
呃···
Wh...

539
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,517
你說什麼，數目不少，什麼意思？ 你在做什麼？
It's a lot of money. What are you doing? What do you mean, forget the money?

540
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:27,561
我在做什麼 ？我在對話筒喃喃自語
What am I doing? I'm talking to an empty telephone...

541
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:29,396
我不明白
I don't understand.

542
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:33,234
因為跟我講電話的另一端，是個死人
...because there is a dead man on the other end of this fucking line.

543
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,755
我的天
Oh, my.

544
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,258
- 你喜歡嗎？ - 看我的戒指
- Do you like it? - Look at my ring.

545
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,844
哇喔
Wow.

546
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:05,766
你之前就知道的？好美
Did you know about this? It's so beautiful.

547
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,601
你真瘋狂
You are insane.

548
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:13,732
喜歡嗎？
Do you like it?

549
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,776
- 好美 - 是，很棒
- It's beautiful. - Yeah, it's pretty good.

550
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:19,280
- 別問他從哪裏得來的 - 沒錯
- Just don't ask him where he got it. - Yeah, that's right.

551
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,998
你長大後想做什麼，親愛的？
What do you wanna be when you grow up, honey?

552
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,375
我不知道
I don't know.

553
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,547
她不知道，跟我一樣，我也不知道
She doesn't know. Just like me. I don't know either.

554
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:52,479
喂？
Hello?

555
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,565
是我
Hi, it's me.

556
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:58,485
我在想你是否會來電話
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

557
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:02,573
我最近很忙，我可以見你嗎？
I've been busy. Can I see you?

558
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:07,745
我害怕那只是一夜情
I was afraid that was just the one night, you know?

559
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,831
不，對我來說不是
No, not for me, it wasn't.

560
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,919
我也不是
Yeah, me neither.

561
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,339
我可以來嗎？
Can I fall by?

562
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:22,676
- 可以 - 好，一會兒見
- Yeah. - Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

563
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:34,855
謝謝
Thank you.

564
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,358
晚安
Good night.

565
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,902
該死的聚餐
Goddamn convention.

566
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,155
- 哪一個是滑頭？ - 魁梧的那個
- Which one's Slick? - The wide one.

567
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:44,531
有兩個監聽器
Got two transmitters.

568
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,743
一個在輪艙裏，備用的在防火牆裏
One's in the wheel well, backup's in the firewall.

569
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:49,370
是我們的車
Okay, get ready.

570
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,747
- 跟尼爾說晚安了嗎？ - 晚安
- Did you say good night to Neil? - Good night.

571
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:55,542
金髮的是克裏斯薛哈利斯 特別調查組正派人輪流跟蹤
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis. SIS has got a revolving tail...

572
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,503
和監聽他家的電話
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

573
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:03,050
切利托開過貴重金屬庫三次
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals depository three times.

574
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:06,095
裏面有白金、銀和一些金條
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

575
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:09,223
山米和我認為那是他們下一個目標
Sammy and I think that's gonna be their next score.

576
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,392
那獨行俠是誰？
Who's the loner?

577
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,398
我們第一次見他，還沒開始跟蹤他
First time we're seeing him. We're not on him yet.

578
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,068
那趕快開始吧
Well, get on it.

579
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,328
好
Okay.

580
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:44,550
他們下次不管做什麼案得手 走出大門時
When these guys walk out the door of whatever score they're gonna take next...

581
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:48,595
鐵定會大吃一驚
...they're gonna have the surprise of a lifetime.

582
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:06,363
寶貝，我得走了
Hey, baby. Time to go.

583
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,533
我讓你很開心吧？
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

584
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,744
是的
Oh, yeah.

585
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:16,206
你很棒，很不錯
You fly. You cool.

586
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:27,551
你騙我，我看得出別人騙我
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.

587
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:31,722
我沒說謊，你狠勇猛
Mm, I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

588
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,475
是個出色的騎士
A regular rodeo rider.

589
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:38,020
是我年輕的生命中，有過最精采的性交
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.

590
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,735
我現在得回到街上去
Now I got to get my ass street side, sugar.

591
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:47,196
你沒有說實話的作風
You don't have a truth-telling style.

592
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:51,909
- 你在說什麼？ - 你不知道是怎麼回事
- What are you talking about? - You don't know what this is.

593
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,876
死神來探望你了
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

594
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,979
你去了哪裏？
Where you been?

595
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,191
鵜鶘海灣監獄
SHU at Pelican Bay.

596
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,735
褔松監獄，B座
New Folsom, B-wing.

597
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:31,115
我是牛仔，吃得了苦
I am a cowboy looking for anything heavy.

598
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,992
比利雷克茨說來找你
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

599
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,537
因此我到這裏來
That is why I am here.

600
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,795
你···
Why don't you...?

601
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:48,507
你何不給這人打通電話？
Why don't you call this guy?

602
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:51,343
他經常在徵人
This guy's always putting guys on.

603
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,223
謝了，兄弟
Thank you, brother.

604
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,977
- 我能請你喝一杯嗎？ - 請我喝一杯
- I'll buy you a drink? - Buy me a drink.

605
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,234
- 有什麼好笑的？ - 沒什麼
- What's so funny? - Nothing.

606
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:10,612
- 很白癡 - 好像有人疏忽了
- It's really dumb. - Something smells negligent.

607
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,699
你們倆天生一對，是怎麼認識的？
You two are perfect for each other. How did you meet?

608
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:20,539
我念小學時認識一個人
I knew this guy in, uh, grade school.

609
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,875
他叫拉烏，還是什麼的
He was named Raoul, uh... Whatever.

610
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,712
他可以把手指一個一個向上疊
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers and fold them over, one over the other.

611
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,839
然後他會把眼瞼向外翻
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out...

612
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:33,010
我忍不住對你上下其手，是真的
I can't keep my hands off you, and that's the truth.

613
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:38,515
你吸引人的地方就在於你的獸性
That's what's so wonderful about you, in that bestial sort of way.

614
00:58:42,604 --> 00:58:44,229
女人
Woman.

615
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,613
這最好是山崩地裂的大事
This better be earth-shattering.

616
00:58:52,823 --> 00:58:54,658
（一個傅呼 緊急事，105 - 3685）

617
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,662
這是她說的，為拉烏乾杯
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

618
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,873
- 為拉烏乾杯 - 為拉烏乾杯
- Raoul. - To Raoul.

619
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,209
我是文森漢納
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

620
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:28,567
（提供周租）

621
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:49,378
發現她時是這樣
Here's how we found her.

622
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:55,676
- 她幾歲？ - 十六、七歲
- How old? - Sixteen, seventeen.

623
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,886
在這裏約六小時
Been here about six hours.

624
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,513
她怎麼死的，瑞秋？
How'd she die, Rachel?

625
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:03,100
頭部被重擊，大腦血腫，像其他人一樣
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.

626
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,062
那是誰？
Who's that?

627
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:10,315
- 我想是死者母親及家人 - 他們為何到這來？
- Mother and siblings, I guess. - What the hell they doing here?

628
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:14,194
因為消息走漏，有人認識死者 通知家人
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

629
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,530
好，打開吧
Okay, let's go.

630
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,411
真好
That's nice.

631
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,748
直覺告訴我，化驗精液後，會是同一人
When I run a DNA check on the semen, my intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

632
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,127
所以是連環謀殺案，要由你著手調查
So it's a series, and ending up in your court.

633
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:33,422
- 兇案組警長有頭緒嗎？ - 還沒有
- Sheriff's Homicide getting anywhere? - Not yet.

634
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:36,425
- 抓住她 - 放開我，放開我
- Get her. - Get off me. Get off me.

635
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,093
噢
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

636
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:40,762
- 我的天 - 等等
- Oh, my God. - Hold it, hold it.

637
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:48,312
- 她在哪裏？ - 冷靜
- Where is she? - Easy, easy, easy.

638
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:52,774
拜託，別這樣
Please. Please, come on.

639
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:58,488
- 沒事的 - 是誰幹的？
- It's okay. It's okay. - Who did this?

640
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:01,700
我的女兒呢？她在哪裏？
Where's my baby? Where is she?

641
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:05,245
我要知道是怎麼回事
I need to know what happened.

642
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,247
我猜山崩地裂的事的確發生了
I guess the Earth shattered.

643
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:53,251
你為何不讓博斯高先送你回家？
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

644
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:58,131
我不想掃他們的興 發生了什麼事？
I didn't wanna ruin their night too. What was it?

645
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,676
你不會想知道的
You don't wanna know.

646
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:04,179
我想知道你為何扳起臉孔
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look.

647
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:07,808
我不能透露，你是知道的，我們走吧
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go. Come on.

648
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,686
你從沒告訴我，我會被摒除事外
You never told me I'd be excluded.

649
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:17,150
我們剛在一起時，我告訴過你 你要和我分享
I told you when we hooked up, baby, that you were gonna have to share me...

650
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:21,071
世上所有的醜行及醜惡的人
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

651
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,659
我同意分享，因為我愛你
And I bought into that sharing because I love you.

652
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:31,748
你發胖、禿頭、有沒有錢、開公車 我都不在乎，我仍愛你
I love you fat, bald, money, no money, driving a bus. I don't care.

653
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,127
但你得像一般人一樣，偶爾跟我交心
But you have got to be present like a normal guy some of the time.

654
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,838
那才叫分享，這不是分享 我得到的是殘缺不全的東西
That's sharing. This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

655
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,007
我懂了，所以我回家後，應該告訴你
Oh, I see. What I should do is come home and say:

656
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:45,053
親愛的，你知道嗎？我今天看到一個
Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

657
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:48,974
吸毒男子用微波爐，把他的小孩煮熟
...where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

658
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,769
因為他哭得太大聲，讓我和你分享吧
...because it was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

659
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,772
讓我們分享此事，而在分享時
Come on, let's share that, and in sharing it...

660
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:01,945
我們可以宣洩一切不好的事，對嗎？
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit, right?

661
01:03:04,574 --> 01:03:06,950
錯，你知道為什麼嗎？
Wrong. You know why?

662
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:09,286
因為你喜歡正常的作法
Because you prefer the normal routine.

663
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,663
我們做愛，然後你不出一語
We fuck, then you lose the power of speech.

664
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,374
因為我得保持我的痛楚
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

665
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:18,336
我保存它，因為我需要藉此提高警覺
I preserve it, because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

666
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,923
我必須這麼做
Where I gotta be.

667
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,765
你不是和我同住
You don't live with me.

668
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:36,188
你和死者的殘骸同住
You live among the remains of dead people.

669
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:40,817
在地面上找線索
You read the terrain.

670
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:45,322
你尋找死亡的跡象
You search for signs of passing...

671
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,532
找獵物的氣味
...for the scent of your prey...

672
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,493
然後追捕他們
...and then you hunt them down.

673
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,706
這是你唯一投入的事
That's the only thing you're committed to.

674
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,795
其餘的是你經過時留下的爛攤子
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

675
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:09,387
我不明白的是，我為何不能離開你
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

676
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,155
嘿，莉莉安小姐，你好
Hey. Miss Lillian.

677
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,909
我們走吧，寶貝
Let's go, baby.

678
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:37,207
我見過經理，還是他是老闆？
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

679
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,544
我為他現在每天在做的事而坐牢
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

680
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:45,131
你可以忍受直至找到新工作嗎？
Baby, can you just handle it till we find you something new?

681
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,467
你可以嗎？
Can you do that?

682
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:52,514
更難忍受的我也捱過
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

683
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,814
你為何和我一起，莉莉安？
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

684
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,317
因為我以你為榮
Because I'm proud of you.

685
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,951
你以我為榮？
You're proud of me?

686
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,957
你為什麼會以我為榮？
What the hell you proud of me for?

687
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,918
回家吧
Come on home.

688
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:35,682
- 你去那裏做什麼？ - 我去滑雪
- What were you doing there? - I was skiing.

689
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,059
我試圖滑雪
I was trying to ski.

690
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,605
那就是大家去那裏的原 因，滑雪
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

691
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,107
順便認識別人
...and you meet people.

692
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:45,775
有個愉快的時光
You try to have a good time.

693
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,611
- 你有愉快的時光嗎？ - 沒有
- Did you have a good time? - No.

694
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:48,903
為什麼？
Why not?

695
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:51,406
我不擅交際
I'm not good at meeting people.

696
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:53,491
你認識了我
You met me.

697
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,578
我沒細想，事情便發生了
Well, that happened without my thinking about it.

698
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,247
可能就是因為這個緣故
Which is why, probably.

699
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:01,958
不，那是因為你很有魅力
No, it's because you were fine.

700
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,545
伊迪
Eady.

701
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:09,257
跟我一起去玩
Take off with me for a while.

702
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,510
- 哪裏？ - 紐西蘭
- Where? - New Zealand.

703
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:15,930
什麼時候？
When?

704
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,476
我不能和你同去 但我可以和你在那會合
I have to go separate, but you could meet me there.

705
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:21,645
但我的工作，我的···
But my job, my...

706
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:26,650
我有錢，你不需要賺錢 你可以在那裏開個設計公司，在那工作
I got money. You don't need money. You could set up a studio, do work there.

707
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,653
- 我不知道 - 還要知道什麼？
- I don't know. - What's there to know?

708
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,780
你是不是已經結婚了？
Are you married?

709
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,449
- 什麼？ - 你來去無蹤
- What? - You come and go...

710
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:36,242
我才沒有結婚
The last thing I am is married.

711
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,454
我的人生正在走下坡，大空白
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way, a double blank.

712
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,456
可是，突然
Then, all of a sudden...

713
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,668
出現了你這樣的人
...someone like you comes along.

714
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,840
- 你還不夠瞭解我，尼爾 - 我瞭解得夠多了
- You don't know me, Neil. - I know enough.

715
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,388
跟我走
Come with me.

716
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,816
怎麼了，親愛的？
What's wrong, baby?

717
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:12,278
沒什麼，一切都好，你會去嗎？
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

718
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,368
會
Yeah.

719
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:23,248
很好
Good.

720
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,816
- 親愛的 - 你好
- Hey, sweetie. - Hi.

721
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:53,194
怎麼了？你忘了媽媽會去接你嗎？
What happened? You forget your mom was picking you up?

722
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:56,156
不是
No.

723
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,534
那是怎麼回事？
So, what's going on?

724
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:03,246
我想獨自一人待著
I felt like being alone.

725
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,876
好吧，我送你回家
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

726
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:16,384
- 嘿，麥克 - 嘿，蘿倫
- Hey, Mike. - Hey, Lauren.

727
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:05,600
有何動靜？
What's happening?

728
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:08,603
小隊長
Lieutenant. Sir.

729
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:11,397
傑克森警長想知道有何動靜
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

730
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:14,567
沒有動靜，不要用無線電
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

731
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,960
傑克森是個···
Jackson's a...

732
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:43,097
（投資級金屬）

733
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,456
好技術
Technique.

734
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,895
芝麻開門，就在那裏
Open sesame. Right there.

735
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:31,162
他行動了
There he goes.

736
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,976
- 我們離開 - 我快完成了
- We walk. - I'm right there.

737
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:37,145
我們離開，現在馬上走
We walk! Now! Come on.

738
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,575
他聽到了
He's heard it.

739
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,994
他聽到了
He's heard it.

740
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,087
注意
Heads up.

741
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:05,882
- 一個人出來了 - 等等，警長
- One's coming out. - Hold it, captain.

742
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,677
- 文森，他沒帶走任何東西 - 是，我看到了
- Vincent, he's not carrying anything. - Yeah, I see.

743
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,058
- 行動 - 要等我上司批准
- Here we go. - Not till my boss says so.

744
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,727
文森，他們倆都沒拿東西
Vincent, both of them are not carrying anything.

745
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,571
- 好，讓他們走 - 什麼意思？
- Okay, let them go. - What do you mean?

746
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:29,781
我們可以逮捕他們
We can take them...

747
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,033
控以何罪？非法入侵？
What are you gonna take them on? Breaking and entry?

748
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:34,285
你不懂嗎？他們還沒偷東西
They didn't steal anything. Don't you get it?

749
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:36,704
是輕罪
It gets knocked back to some misdemeanor...

750
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:39,373
他們坐牢半年便可出獄，不行
...they do six months and they're out. No fucking way.

751
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,668
我會挨上級罵，他們不能走
I'm not taking the heat from my boss. They're not walking.

752
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:46,506
他們會走，今次行動由我指揮
That's exactly what they're gonna do. They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

753
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:49,050
我的戰略指揮凌駕你的職位
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

754
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:53,346
他們會離去，你會讓他們走，可惡
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck.

755
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:40,476
回去工作
Back to work.

756
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:45,606
洛杉磯警察？他們從哪裏冒出來的？
L.A.P.D. Gee, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

757
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,441
或許他們知道那裏被劫
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

758
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:51,070
不是因為我們 而是因為那裏以前曾多次被劫
The place, not us. Because it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

759
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,906
假設他們監聽我們的電話住所
Assume they got our phones, assume they got our houses...

760
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:56,576
假設他們現在正在監視我們的一舉一動
...assume they got us right here, right now as we sit.

761
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,703
假設一切
Everything. Assume it all.

762
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,955
我們要如何付科索銀行的頭期款？
How we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?

763
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:04,292
- 那不是問題，我會先墊 - 那凡讚那里呢？
- I'll front that. That's not a problem. - What happens to Van Zant?

764
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,462
警方在追查我們，你想和他開戰嗎？
With the heat we got, do you wanna play World War II in the streets with Van Zant?

765
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,548
不，我想要我的75萬 而他卻可以亳發無傷？
No, I want my 750. And he gets a pass?

766
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:15,052
我比你們更想殺了凡贊 但他現在成了奢侈品
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

767
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,638
問題是我們搶銀行遠是離去？
Our problem is, take the bank or split right now?

768
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:20,308
不要回家，不要收拾東西 什麼都不要做
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

769
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,644
30秒後我們各自走我們的陽關道
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways.

770
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,062
就此結束
That's it.

771
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,814
克裏斯
Chris.

772
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:32,153
值得冒險搶劫銀行
The bank is worth the risk.

773
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:34,322
我需要錢
I need it, brother.

774
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:39,160
我認為我們應該留下來搶銀行
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

775
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,757
你做什麼我都會跟隨，尼爾，任何事
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever. Whatever.

776
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:56,385
這次不行，麥克，你要自行決定
No, not on this one, Michael. On this one, you're on your own.

777
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,359
你覺得這是最好的作法嗎？
You figure this is the best thing to do?

778
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:13,361
這是最好的作法嗎？
This is the best thing to do?

779
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:17,782
我打算事成後收手，所以對我來說 風險也許值得
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for me the reward is maybe worth the stretch.

780
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,868
但伊蓮很會理財，你存有很多錢
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

781
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:22,536
你有基金和地產
You got T-bonds, real estate.

782
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:26,082
如果我是你，就不會參與這次行動
If I were you, I would be smart. I would cut loose of this.

783
01:16:44,518 --> 01:16:48,229
對我來說，冒險才是我追求的
Well, you know, for me, the action is the juice.

784
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:49,438
我參加
I'm in.

785
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:54,944
你也是？
You too?

786
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:56,862
是，當然
Yeah, sure.

787
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,698
我們動手吧
Let's go.

788
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,741
去他們 的，我們行動吧
Fuck them, let's do it.

789
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:03,494
好，我們有很多事要做
All right, let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

790
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,843
- 你不能進去 - 你看著
- You can't go in there. - Watch this.

791
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:21,178
- 不好意思，那··· - 提姆，我再打給你
- Excuse me. That... - Tim, I gotta call you back.

792
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,805
你得先預約
You have to have an appointment.

793
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,807
- 有何貴幹？ - 你是艾倫馬西亞諾？
- Can I help you? - Are you Alan Marciano?

794
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:27,435
- 是，你是誰？ - 我是誰？
- Yeah, and who the fuck are you? - Who am I?

795
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:30,688
- 幹什麼 - 文森漢納，洛城警局小隊長
- Hey. Hey. - Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

796
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:34,108
洛城？這裏是拉斯維加斯 不在你管轄范圉
L.A.? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

797
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:37,778
我不知道你們以為自己惹到了誰
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck you guys think you're pushing around...

798
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:43,284
- 我有認識人，好嗎？ - 賭城警方可以拘留你
- ...but I know people here, okay? - Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.

799
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,912
引渡你回紐澤西的紐華克
You are extradited to Newark on a New Jersey warrant...

800
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,333
因為三年前，你從北卡羅來納走私香煙
...for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago...

801
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,668
或你可以和我們合作
...or you go to work for us.

802
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,628
簡單明瞭
Cut and dried.

803
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:57,631
- 就這樣 - 該死
- That is it. - Oh, shit.

804
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,551
夏琳薛哈利斯
Charlene Shiherlis.

805
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,470
- 誰？ - 誰？
- Who? - Who?

806
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,805
誰？你是八哥嗎？一直重複同樣的話
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

807
01:18:05,182 --> 01:18:08,809
那個上星期每天和你在電話中 淫聲穢語的女子
The lady you been talking dirty to on the telephone every day the last week.

808
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:11,228
你不能證明我和她有關係
Yeah, you know what? You can't tie me to her.

809
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:15,316
不需要，你肯定會回去紐澤西的 蠢貨
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jack off.

810
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:19,362
我只是···我為和會和她牽扯上？
Oh, man, I just... Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?

811
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:22,239
因為她的屁股動人！
Because she got a great ass!

812
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,911
你一頭鑽了進去
And you got your head all the way up it.

813
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,496
老天
Jesus.

814
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:34,668
當我想起屁股，女人的屁股
When I think of asses, a woman's ass...

815
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:37,171
就會不由自主
...something comes out of me.

816
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,591
- 那麼？ - 小事一樁
- So? - So no big thing.

817
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:45,888
我只想知道她的丈夫和他們那夥人
All I want is her husband and his whole fucking crew.

818
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:48,349
你會和這位卓克警探合作
Now, you're gonna work with Sergeant Drucker here.

819
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:55,606
聖克裏門提路和赫莫沙街
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.

820
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:58,442
我們在那裏穿過欄柵，從那進入
That's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.

821
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,735
對
Right.

822
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:02,738
這裏的保安系統不堪一擊
The security systems around here are a joke.

823
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:10,037
逃走路線一是聖文森湯姆斯橋
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge, that's Escape Route Number 1.

824
01:19:10,956 --> 01:19:14,208
路線二，從安納海姆上110號公路
Number 2, over here, Anaheim to the 110.

825
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,709
- 好 - 好嗎？
- Good. - Okay?

826
01:19:15,877 --> 01:19:18,587
- 很好 - 明白嗎？好，走吧
- Yeah. That's fine. - Got it? Good. Let's go.

827
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,571
他們回頭望向···
They were looking back...

828
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,073
這方向
...in this direction.

829
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:48,242
貸櫃設施？
A container facility?

830
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:52,955
- 偷貨車運送？ - 太明顯，對他們來說錢太少了
- For a cartage theft? - Too visible. Too lowball for them.

831
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:59,086
旁邊是煉油廠，那邊是廢車場
Next door's an oil refinery, over there's a scrap yard.

832
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:03,757
煉油廠發薪用支票，沒有現金
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around. Same for the scrap yard.

833
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:03,759
廢車場也一樣

834
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:09,472
也許他們想偷車輪蓋
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

835
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:15,936
煉油廠和廢車場？
A refinery and a scrap yard.

836
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:19,940
- 是怎麼回事？ - 這就是我們想要搞清楚的
- What the hell is going on? - That's what we're trying to figure out.

837
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,943
我們以為已經搞清楚了
We thought we had it.

838
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:24,778
以為已經搞清楚了
Thought we had it.

839
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:39,001
我知道他們在看什麼
I got an idea of what they were looking at.

840
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,216
- 你們想知道嗎？ - 什麼？
- You wanna know what they're looking at? - What?

841
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:50,012
這人真了不起，他真行
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?

842
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:54,058
這夥人很棒
This crew is good.

843
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:57,394
你們想知道他們在看什麼嗎？
You know what they were looking at?

844
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:58,979
什麼？
What?

845
01:21:00,232 --> 01:21:01,899
我們
Us.

846
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,818
洛城警察
The L.A.P.D.

847
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,363
是警察部門
The police department.

848
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,157
我們被認出來了
We just got made.

849
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:19,375
是的
Yeah.

850
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,343
好
Okay.

851
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:39,562
好，雜種！
Okay, motherfucker!

852
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:01,834
科索交出來了嗎？
Kelso come through?

853
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:05,212
交出來了，藍圖很詳盡
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

854
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:14,054
那人姓漢納，叫文森
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

855
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:18,601
我用五百元賄賂了一個警員 漢納在監視你一舉一動
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards. Hanna's all over you.

856
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:21,729
監視所有的車，還有麥克和薛哈利斯的家
He's on all the work cars. Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

857
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:24,231
沒有監視你，因為不知道你晚上去哪裏
Not yours, they've been losing you at night.

858
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,485
漢納很積極，研究所，海軍陸戰隊
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school. Marine Corps.

859
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,779
是劫案及兇案組小隊長，重案組
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide, Major Crime Unit.

860
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:34,241
逮捕了不少人 在芝加哥殺了法蘭基楊德
He's taken down some heavy crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

861
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,660
他是個瘋子
And he was a fucking maniac.

862
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:41,081
他之前在緝毒組工作，發生了些問題 離過兩次婚
He was working Narcotics before that. Had some problems, divorced twice.

863
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:44,251
目前的太太叫賈絲汀 是他下令嚴密監視的
Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat.

864
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:48,422
我的刑警隊警官線人
The Vice sergeant...

865
01:22:49,466 --> 01:22:51,759
說漢納喜歡你
...says Hanna likes you.

866
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:55,846
認為你是明星，能做這做那
Thinks you're some kind of star. You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

867
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,974
行事很有技巧，很聰明
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

868
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:02,936
這一點也不好笑，結過三次婚
Funny as a heart attack, man. Three marriages.

869
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,398
你認為是為什麼？他喜歡待在家？
What the fuck do you think that means? He likes staying home?

870
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:09,276
這代表他是那種
Means the man is one of those guys out there...

871
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:12,363
整晚工作的人，很投入
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

872
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,867
有他和警方監視，取消搶劫銀行吧
With this guy and this much heat, you should pass.

873
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,626
值得冒險一試
It's worth the stretch.

874
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:31,465
他可以出錯，而你一次都不能出錯
This guy can hit and miss. You can't miss once.

875
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,634
你確定嗎？
You sure?

876
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,969
我確定
I'm sure.

877
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,643
我們去車庫吧
Let's go to the garage.

賈絲汀
Justine.

879
01:24:03,498 --> 01:24:05,457
賈絲汀？
Justine?

880
01:24:11,339 --> 01:24:13,132
我們要去哪裏？
Where we going?

881
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:21,223
- 好吧，你要去哪裏？ - 外出

883
01:25:23,997 --> 01:25:28,257
他們在405號公路，往機場方向北走
They're northbound out LAX on the 405. We got four ground units.

884
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,311
我是文森漢納，在18號機 有什麼動靜？
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18. Who have I got?

885
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:53,232
文森，我是40號機的 J J ，李察葛洛佛跟我在一起
Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40. Richard Glover's with me.

01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:57,569
車在105號公路東行 接近110號公路交叉
It's on the 105 eastbound approaching the 110 interchange.

887
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,616

- You running a revolving tail? - Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.

888
01:26:02,784 --> 01:26:06,829
好的，要其中一輛在佛蒙特州的匝道上接我
Okay, have one of them pick me up at the Vermont on-ramp.

889
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:08,413
走吧
Let's go.

890
01:26:58,423 --> 01:27:02,384
我離他100碼嗎？太近還是太遠？
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?

891
01:27:02,552 --> 01:27:05,137
他離你300碼，在中間車道
Three hundred yards, center lane.

892
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:13,580
你好嗎？
How you doing?

893
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:19,795
我請你喝杯咖啡如何？
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

894
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:29,221
- 好，走吧 - 跟我走
- Yeah, sure. Let's go. - Follow me.

895
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:47,447
你在福松監獄七年

896
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:49,449
單獨囚禁三年

897
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:50,909
之前在麥克尼爾監獄
McNeil before that.

898
01:28:54,497 --> 01:28:56,832
麥克尼爾真的像他們說的那樣不堪嗎？
McNeil as tough as they say?

899
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,584
你想當監獄學者嗎？
You looking to become a penologist?

900
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,200
你想再坐牢嗎？
You're looking to go back?

901
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,600
我追捕了一些想犯錯再度入獄的人
You know, I chase down some crews guys just looking to fuck up,

902
01:29:04,132 --> 01:29:08,553


903
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,552
你是那種人嗎？
get busted back. That you?

904
01:29:09,262 --> 01:29:11,471
你逮捕的人鐵定是些飯桶

905
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:14,474
我逮捕各式各樣的人

906
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:20,022
你認為我是尋刺激行劫酒鋪
You see me doing thrill-seeking liquor-store holdups...

907
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:22,524
胸膛上刺著「天生輸家」的人嗎？
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

908
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:25,527
- 我不認為 - 對
- No, I do not. - Right.

909
01:29:26,696 --> 01:29:28,530
我不會再坐牢
I am never going back.

910
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:32,409
那麼就別再搶劫
Then don't take down scores.

911
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:36,204
我做我擅長做的事，搶劫
I do what I do best, I take scores.

912
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:40,000
你做你擅長做的事，阻止我這樣的人
You do what you do best, trying to stop guys like me.

913
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,048
你從不想過正常生活？
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

914
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:49,217
那是什麼？烤肉和看球賽嗎？
What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?

915
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,095
是的
Yeah.

916
01:29:54,557 --> 01:29:59,770
- 像你一樣正常的生活嗎？ - 我的生活？不，我的生活
- This regular-type life like your life? - My life? No, my life...

917
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,689
我的生活一塌糊塗
No, my life's a disaster zone.

918
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:07,277
我的繼女情緒深受困擾
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

919
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:10,530
因為她的生父是個大渾蛋
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

920
01:30:10,698 --> 01:30:14,576
我和太太，我們的婚姻正面臨破碎邊緣
I got a wife. We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage...

921
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:16,620
這是我的第三度婚姻
...my third...

922
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:21,708
因為我把所有時間都花在 追捕像你這樣的人
...because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

923
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:23,919
那就是我的生活
That's my life.

924
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:31,968
有人曾對我說：
A guy told me one time:

925
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:35,514
「要了無牽掛
Don't let yourself get attached to anything...

926
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:38,391
隨時可以一走了之
...you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat...

927
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:40,727
一旦感到風頭不對時」
...if you feel the heat around the corner.

928
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:45,190
如果你想抓我，我行動時你也行動
Now, if you're on me, and you gotta move when I move...

929
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:48,527
你要如何才能保有婚姻呢？
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

930
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:52,572
這說法很有趣
Well, that's an interesting point.

931
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,951
你是出家人嗎？
What are you, a monk?

932
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:57,911
我有女伴
I have a woman.

933
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:00,080
你怎麼告訴她？
What do you tell her?

934
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:04,042
我說我是推銷員
I tell her I'm a salesman.

935
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:13,927
那麼你如果見我從街角走來
So then, if you spot me coming around that corner...

936
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:17,097
你會離開她？
...you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

937
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,058
不告而別？
Not say goodbye?

938
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:22,561
要有這樣的自律
That's the discipline.

939
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,688
那心靈會很空虛，不是嗎？
That's pretty vacant, no?

940
01:31:24,856 --> 01:31:26,523
正是如此
Yeah, it is what it is.

941
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:29,317
不這樣做，我們還是另找職業吧
It's that, or we both better go do something else, pal.

942
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,238
我不懂做別的
I don't know how to do anything else.

943
01:31:33,823 --> 01:31:35,699
我也不懂
Neither do I.

944
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:41,621
- 我不想 - 我也不想
- I don't much want to either. - Neither do I.

945
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:52,883
我不斷重複這夢境
You know, I have this recurring dream.

946
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:56,511
我坐在偌大的餐宴席上
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

947
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:00,557
我調查過的兇殺案受害人全部出席
...and all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting at this table...

948
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:04,978
他們用漆黑的眼珠子瞪著我
...and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

949
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:10,150
因為他們頭部中槍出血
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

950
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,987
這些屍體發脹
And there they are, these big balloon people...

951
01:32:14,155 --> 01:32:17,240
因為他們被殺兩周後 我才在床下發現他們
...because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

952
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:20,911
鄰居報警說有惡臭
The neighbors reported the smell...

953
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:25,457
他們全部出席，坐在那裏
...and there they are, all of them just sitting there.

954
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:28,210
他們說什麼？
What do they say?

955
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:31,671
沒說話
Nothing.

956
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:33,506
- 沒人說話？ - 沒人
- No talk? - None.

957
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:37,302
他們無話可說
Just... They don't have anything to say.

958
01:32:37,929 --> 01:32:40,347
我們彼此望著對方
See, we just look at each other.

959
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:45,644
他們望著我，就這樣，夢境就是這樣
They look at me. And that's it, that's the dream.

960
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,398
我有夢到自己溺水
I have one where I'm drowning.

961
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:54,236
我得叫醒自己起來呼吸 否則會死在夢裏
And I gotta wake myself up and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

962
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:57,822
你知道這象徵什麼嗎？
You know what that's about?

963
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:01,034
知道，要有足夠的時間
Yeah. Having enough time.

964
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:07,791
- 足夠時間，做你想做的事？ - 是的
- Enough time to do what you wanna do? - That's right.

965
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:13,380
- 你現在這樣做？ - 還沒有
- You doing it now? - No, not yet.

966
01:33:18,261 --> 01:33:20,553
我們坐在這裏
You know, we're sitting here...

967
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:23,723
你和我，像兩個普通人
...you and I, like a couple of regular fellows.

968
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:26,601
彼此做必須做的事
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

969
01:33:28,896 --> 01:33:31,898
現在我們見過面
And now that we've been face to face...

970
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:39,197
如果要我在案發現場殺你，我不會喜歡
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it.

971
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:40,699
但我告訴你
But I'll tell you...

972
01:33:43,244 --> 01:33:46,746
如果是在你和讓你殺死···
...if it's between you and some poor bastard...

973
01:33:46,914 --> 01:33:49,416
妻子會成寡婦的人當中作選擇
...whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

974
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:54,587
兄弟，沒命的會是你
...brother, you are going down.

975
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:09,144
換另一面想
There's a flip side to that coin.

976
01:34:10,938 --> 01:34:15,275
如果你逼得我走投無路 我不得不殺你呢？
What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down?

977
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:21,281
因為不論如何，你都不能阻止我
Because no matter what, you will not get in my way.

978
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:24,909
是的，我們見過面
We've been face to face, yeah...

979
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:31,624
但我會亳不猶疑殺你，一秒也不會遲疑
...but I will not hesitate. Not for a second.

980
01:34:37,465 --> 01:34:39,799
也許真會這樣
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

981
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:44,763
或是誰知道呢？
Or who knows?

982
01:34:44,972 --> 01:34:47,724
也許我們永遠不會再見
Or maybe we'll never see each other again.

983
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,783
他們擺脫了我們
They dumped us.

984
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,410
什麼？
What?

985
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:10,872
- 他們逃脫了 - 什麼意思，逃脫了？
- They dumped us. - What do you mean, they dumped us?

986
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,123
克裏斯逃脫了
Chris slipped his tail.

987
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:14,876
他沒跟夏琳談及搶劫的事
He doesn't talk about scores with Charlene...

988
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:17,629
所以無法從馬西亞諾那邊得到資料 我試過了
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I tried.

989
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:20,048
- 切利托？ - 也一樣
- What about Cheritto? - Same.

990
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:22,967
監聽詢答機被放到 往聖克裏門提的公車上
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

991
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:29,849
- 他們擺脫我們所有的監視？ - 是的，同一時間，晚上九點
- They dumped all our surveillance? - Yeah, at the same time. 9 p.m.

992
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:34,187
我半小時前才和麥考利喝咖啡！
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

993
01:35:34,355 --> 01:35:36,689
我們有跟蹤，但之後麥考利開到機場
We were on you. Then McCauley drives into LAX...

994
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,859
我們無法靠近監視，因為飛行跑道
...where surveillance can't fly over because of flight paths.

995
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:43,363
他的車子仍在，人不見了
His car's still there. He's gone.

996
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:53,748
有誰知道他們在哪裏嗎？
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

997
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:54,100
他有聯絡嗎？
You hear from him yet?

998
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:58,730
沒有，這讓我更不安，他在哪裏？
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more. Where's this guy?

999
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:05,528
這個人，我們用他，他說他認識麥考利
This guy here. We put him on. Says he knows McCauley.

1000
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:11,743
你是誰？
Who are you?

1001
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:16,789
韋恩葛羅，我的名字是韋恩葛羅
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

1002
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:20,543
我躲在這辦公室好多天了 你跟他很熟嗎？
I've been living in this office day and night. How well do you know him?

1003
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:24,797
我們一起做了不少大買賣
Oh, we took some major scores together.

1004
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,802
他為何還沒找上我？
How come I haven't heard from him?

1005
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:33,806
他可能在忙，但他做事很徹底
Well, he's probably busy right now, but he's real thorough.

1006
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:39,103
- 他不會忘記你的 - 真令人安心
- He ain't gonna forget about you. - Oh, that's reassuring.

1007
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:44,025
我可以做點事
Well, I got some moves I could make here.

1008
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:47,487
可能對你會很有幫助
Probably be a big help to you.

1009
01:38:08,509 --> 01:38:09,842
認得那個在烤肉的人嗎？
You recognize the grill man?

1010
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:22,313
- 不認得 - 福松D座，和多比羅許同一囚室
- No. - Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1011
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:27,527
- 我還沒休息 - 西斯科和潘喬沒上班
- Ain't got my break yet, man. - Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1012
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:30,697
倒垃圾、拖餐廳後面的地
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1013
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:32,824
稍後再休息
Take your break later.

1014
01:38:32,992 --> 01:38:36,327
人渣，送出去吧
Piece of shit. Pick up.

1015
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:40,832
他在哪裏？
Where the hell is he?

1016
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,335
- 我想弄一輛工作車 - 我也是
- I wanted to check the slot for a work car. - So did I.

1017
01:38:49,508 --> 01:38:50,925
是？
Yeah?

1018
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:53,636
等一等
Hang on.

1019
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,930
- 喂 - 喂
- Yeah. - Hey.

1020
01:38:56,098 --> 01:39:00,643
用普通電話，打103 - 7206
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.

1021
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,061
好
All right.

1022
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:15,074
- 你在哪裏？ - 到處有警察監視我
- Where are you? - There's cops all over me, man.

1023
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:19,245
我無法擺脫他們
They're on me like a cheap suit. I can't dump them.

1024
01:39:21,749 --> 01:39:25,710
- 他們知道你看見他們了？ - 不，他們並行跟蹤
- After the fact you spotted them? - No, no. They're doing parallels.

1025
01:39:28,589 --> 01:39:30,006
我可以再試著擺脫他們
I can try to dump them again.

1026
01:39:30,174 --> 01:39:34,552
我們怎麼知道你是否擺脫了 如果沒有，你會引他們來找我們
How are we gonna know if you did? If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

1027
01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:36,846
去文杜拉，把他們帶離這裏
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

1028
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:41,100
對不起，我真不想讓你失望的
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man. Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

1029
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:05,708
快點
Come on, man.

1030
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:08,920
送出去
Pick up.

1031
01:40:09,672 --> 01:40:12,715
- 尼爾，你好嗎？ - 你好嗎？
- Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up? - What's up, brother?

1032
01:40:12,883 --> 01:40:15,259
你在這裏做什麼？
Man, what you doing here?

1033
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:19,180
我在找可以應付警方跟蹤的司機
What I am doing is I'm looking for a driver who can handle scanners and a radio.

1034
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:20,390
現在就需要
Right now, today.

1035
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:21,974
你還記得怎麼做嗎？
You remember the drill?

1036
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:23,518
記得
Yeah, man, sure.

1037
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,019

01:57:57,905 --> 01:58:00,240
他替另一個人工作
The other he worked for.

1167
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,077
贊
Zant.

1168
01:58:06,247 --> 01:58:09,624
- 凡贊？ - 是
- Van Zant? - Yeah.

1169
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:11,626
凡贊
Van Zant.

1170
01:58:11,794 --> 01:58:14,880
- 你確定嗎？ - 凡贊
- Are you sure? - Van Zant.

1171
01:58:16,758 --> 01:58:19,551
你有說出我們會怎樣逃走嗎？
Did you say anything about how we're getting out?

1172
01:58:20,178 --> 01:58:23,221
- 應該沒有，尼爾 - 快想
- I don't think so, Neil. - Come on.

1173
01:58:25,183 --> 01:58:26,808
我不記得，尼爾
I don't remember, Neil.

1174
01:58:32,315 --> 01:58:36,026
- 我去叫救護車 - 我撐不過去的
- I'll call a medic. - I'm not gonna make it.

1175
01:58:37,528 --> 01:58:40,572
我亳無感覺
I can't feel nothing.

1176
01:58:41,949 --> 01:58:44,868
我的安娜死了
My Anna's gone.

1177
01:58:46,037 --> 01:58:48,288
她死了
She's gone.

1178
01:58:49,707 --> 01:58:54,002
別這樣扔下我，尼爾，求求你，兄弟
Don't leave me like this, Neil. Please, holmes.

1179
01:58:55,338 --> 01:58:58,048
別這樣扔下我
Don't leave me like this.

1180
01:59:21,405 --> 01:59:23,615
- 是？ - 奈特
- Yeah? - Nate.

1181
01:59:24,242 --> 01:59:26,910
你用行動電話嗎？用普通電話
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1182
01:59:27,537 --> 01:59:28,703
這是新的電話
It's a new one.

1183
01:59:30,248 --> 01:59:33,041
他住在恩西諾區山景台
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1184
01:59:33,209 --> 01:59:36,545
- 10725號 - 10725號，好
- 10725. - 10725, okay.

1185
01:59:36,712 --> 01:59:39,923
- 克裏斯呢？ - 他和我一起在我家中
- Chris? - He's with me, at my place.

1186
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:42,425
接下來查出韋恩葛羅在哪，好嗎？
Next, Waingro, okay?

1187
01:59:44,554 --> 01:59:45,637
你有時間嗎？
You got the time?

1188
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:49,975
我會抽空的，我要新的逃走路線
I'll make time, and I need a new out laid on.

1189
01:59:50,852 --> 01:59:52,102
你怎麼知道舊路線被洩漏了？
How do you know it's blown?

1190
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:55,897
我怎麼能保證沒有呢？
How can I trust it?

1191
01:59:58,568 --> 02:00:00,443
好的
Okay, you got it.

1192
02:00:00,611 --> 02:00:02,654
保重
Stay healthy.

1193
02:00:07,743 --> 02:00:09,619
夏琳薛哈利斯
Charlene Shiherlis.

1194
02:00:10,371 --> 02:00:13,164
卓克在威尼斯區有地方可以讓她藏身
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice to stash her in.

1195
02:00:13,332 --> 02:00:16,543
尼爾的逃走方法 這裏處理完後，開始詢查
Our Neil's transportation. When we're done here, get on the phone.

1196
02:00:16,711 --> 02:00:19,254
有人正在替他安排
Somewhere, someone's trying to put it together for him.

1197
02:00:19,422 --> 02:00:21,798
你不認為麥考利已經有計劃？
You don't believe McCauley already had a getaway?

1198
02:00:21,966 --> 02:00:26,344
當然有，但他需要另一個計劃 要是你，你還會相信原先的計劃嗎？
Sure he did. Now he needs another one. Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1199
02:00:27,388 --> 02:00:29,723
這告密的人，哪裏找到他的？
This rat motherfucker, where did we get him?

1200
02:00:29,891 --> 02:00:33,435
他是機密線人，通報搶劫銀行
He's a CI for a burglary cop. Called in the tip on the bank.

1201
02:00:33,603 --> 02:00:37,147
至於尼爾麥考利 我們還剩多少時間？
On Neil McCauley, how much time we got?

1202
02:00:37,315 --> 02:00:40,692
他有八到十小時安排新的逃走路線 之後就遠走高飛了
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out. After that, he's gone.

1203
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,819
拜拜啦
Bye-bye. Bam.

1204
02:01:35,665 --> 02:01:40,085
你向我們告發麥考利，你怎麼知道？ 是誰告訴你的
You ratted McCauley to us. How'd you know? Who told you?

1205
02:01:40,252 --> 02:01:42,879
誰告訴你的？你這告密者！
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1206
02:01:43,047 --> 02:01:44,673
是誰？
Who?

1207
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:15,954
康納利針對墨菲 墨菲和萊格特一同對抗
Connelly back in for Murphy. Murphy with Leggat right there with him.

1208
02:02:16,122 --> 02:02:17,914
墨菲從網後準備出招
Murphy tees it up behind the net...

1209
02:02:22,086 --> 02:02:25,296
米勒跑到前頭，墨菲與裁判爭辯
...Miller out front. Now here's Murphy with the referee...

1210
02:02:28,884 --> 02:02:30,051
韋恩葛羅在哪裏？
Waingro, where is he?

1211
02:02:31,429 --> 02:02:33,680
- 他在哪裏？ - 我怎麼知道？
- Where is he? - How the hell would I know?

1212
02:02:59,457 --> 02:03:03,376
這裏有些什麼？
Well, what do we have here, hmm?

1213
02:03:03,836 --> 02:03:07,464
這裏漂亮嗎？漂亮
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty.

1214
02:03:09,925 --> 02:03:12,969
- 你這卑鄙小人 - 你告訴我你想脫離目前困境
- You slimy piece of shit. - You told me you wanted out from under.

1215
02:03:13,137 --> 02:03:16,306
你快嚇死了，對吧？ 你想脫身吧？這就是出路，夏琳
You're scared to death, right? You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1216
02:03:16,474 --> 02:03:20,143
- 你得到了什麼好處？ - 我···蠢女人
- Yeah, what's your end? - I... You stupid broad.

1217
02:03:20,311 --> 02:03:22,771
- 我怎麼會被牽連？ - 別衝動
- How'd I get into this? - Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

1218
02:03:22,938 --> 02:03:24,147
你聽到了
You heard me.

1219
02:03:24,315 --> 02:03:27,358
她飽受驚嚇，幫她倒杯酒
She had a rough ride. Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

1220
02:03:27,526 --> 02:03:30,528
- 去櫥櫃看看 - 去她的
- Look in the cabinet above the sink. - Fuck her.

1221
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:36,076
- 你最好進了櫥櫃就不要出來 - 好，乖
- You'd better get in there and stay in there. - All right, all right.

1222
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:41,081
聽著
Well, lookie here.

1223
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,542
我叫卓克警探，洛杉磯警察局兇案組
My name is Sergeant Drucker, L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1224
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:48,713
- 你要讓多明尼克在臥房睡嗎？ - 他和我一起
- You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom? - He stays with me.

1225
02:03:49,215 --> 02:03:51,132
來吧
There we go.

1226
02:03:58,724 --> 02:04:00,683
現在怎樣？
So, what now?

1227
02:04:02,937 --> 02:04:06,689
他說的對，你想脫身？這是出路
Well, he's right, because you want out, this is out.

1228
02:04:08,109 --> 02:04:11,986
- 你覺得你會出賣克裏斯 - 廢話
- You believe you have to betray Chris. - No shit.

1229
02:04:12,154 --> 02:04:15,115
對，你得這樣做
That's right. You would have to.

1230
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:19,536
如果你不出賣克裏斯 多明尼克會是受害人
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.

1231
02:04:20,037 --> 02:04:23,248
因為當你因從犯而入獄，他會變成孤兒
Because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1232
02:04:23,415 --> 02:04:25,875
你沒有父母可以照顧他
...because you got no living parents to take him.

1233
02:04:26,043 --> 02:04:30,421
他會被送去寄養家庭、少年感化院
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes, juvenile facilities.

1234
02:04:30,589 --> 02:04:32,841
之後他會偷車
Then he steals a car.

1235
02:04:33,092 --> 02:04:38,263
然後不斷入獄成為真正的罪犯
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1236
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:41,724
毀了一生
Fucked for life.

1237
02:04:41,892 --> 02:04:45,228
你是過來人，知道會有何下場
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1238
02:04:46,397 --> 02:04:51,568
多明尼克還沒機會選擇生活 但克裏斯有
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life, but Chris did.

1239
02:04:52,653 --> 02:04:56,239
你如果供出克裏斯，你不會有案底
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1240
02:04:56,407 --> 02:05:00,326
為孩子這樣做，你才能撫養他
You can do it for your kid, so you can raise him.

1241
02:05:04,498 --> 02:05:07,876
- 你還要推銷什麼東西？ - 各種東西
- What else are you selling? - All kinds of shit.

1242
02:05:08,752 --> 02:05:13,965
但我不用說服你，因為我是對的
But I don't have to sell this and you know it, because this kind of shit here sells itself.

1243
02:05:20,264 --> 02:05:22,265
好，丹尼，最新消息
Okay, Danny, here's an update.

1244
02:05:22,433 --> 02:05:25,768
- 卓克在二線 - 小隊長，等一下
- Drucker's on Line 2. - Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1245
02:05:27,938 --> 02:05:30,064
小隊長，卓克在另一個電話線上
Lieutenant, I have Drucker on the other line.

1246
02:05:30,232 --> 02:05:31,608
三人通話吧
Oh, well, conference him in.

1247
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:36,821
- 說吧 - 文森，是我
- Go ahead. - Vincent, it's me.

1248
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:41,367
你的答案是什麼？
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?

1249
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:50,460
我們準備好了，她會打電話
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1250
02:05:50,628 --> 02:05:53,796
好的，情況是這樣
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1251
02:05:53,964 --> 02:05:59,802
休班尼已經改過自新 成為洗心革面的好公民
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born-again good citizen.

1252
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:04,515
顯然一個叫韋恩葛羅的牛仔 向我們出賣尼爾
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

1253
02:06:04,683 --> 02:06:07,435
韋恩葛羅曾是尼爾的手下
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew...

1254
02:06:07,603 --> 02:06:11,189
後來替一個叫凡讚的洗錢人工作
...then he went to work for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1255
02:06:11,357 --> 02:06:17,153
小組正在凡贊家 因為他今晚較早前被殺
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1256
02:06:17,488 --> 02:06:20,823
如果尼爾還有誰要對付 那就是韋恩葛羅
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else, it's gonna be Waingro.

1257
02:06:20,991 --> 02:06:24,327
韋恩葛羅入住機場馬奎斯酒店套房
Waingro just got himself a suite at the airport Marquis...

1258
02:06:24,495 --> 02:06:27,872
化名「詹姆森」，他現在在那
...under the name "Jameson". He's there now.

1259
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:31,125
我要你把這消息告訴保釋人、組頭
I want you to get that to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1260
02:06:31,293 --> 02:06:34,504
警員及線人
...assignment officers and snitches in County.

1261
02:06:34,672 --> 02:06:37,048
任何可以把消息傳開的人
Anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street.

1262
02:06:37,216 --> 02:06:41,386
派人到酒店，並每隔半小時 親自收聽他們的無線電
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally check their come every 30 minutes.

1263
02:06:41,553 --> 02:06:45,640
因為也許尼爾會去找他，你感覺如何？
Because maybe Neil will go for him. Okay? How you feeling?

1264
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:49,602
- 渾身是傷，但我會熬過 - 好
- Banged up, but I'll live. - Okay.

1265
02:06:56,986 --> 02:06:58,861
他在這裏
He's here.

1266
02:06:59,154 --> 02:07:01,364
尼爾還沒走
Neil is still here.

1267
02:07:01,907 --> 02:07:03,866
我可以感覺到
I can feel it.

1268
02:07:04,118 --> 02:07:06,661
但他會留多久？
But for how long?

1269
02:07:07,246 --> 02:07:10,164
最多七八個小時
Seven, eight hours, max.

1270
02:07:18,549 --> 02:07:19,882
你幹了什麼？
What did you do?

1271
02:07:20,592 --> 02:07:24,304
- 是你做的？ - 我沒做的比較重要，我不是賣金屬的
- That was you? - It's what I don't do, I don't sell metal.

1272
02:07:24,471 --> 02:07:27,390
原本計劃順利，你之後離開 但現在出了點麻煩
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

1273
02:07:27,558 --> 02:07:31,561
- 我們要一起走 - 那些和你一起的人呢？
- Now we gotta go together. - Those other people were with you?

1274
02:07:33,689 --> 02:07:35,815
我的朋友，麥克
My friend, Michael...

1275
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:39,527
他知道冒的險有多大 他可以選擇不要參加
...he knew the risks. He didn't have to be there.

1276
02:07:43,532 --> 02:07:46,159
不入虎穴，焉得虎子
It rains, you get wet.

1277
02:07:48,203 --> 02:07:49,412
快收拾東西，我們離開
Get packed and let's go.

1278
02:07:56,587 --> 02:07:59,255
伊迪
Eady.

1279
02:07:58,256 --> 02:07:59,298
伊迪

1280
02:08:09,016 --> 02:08:12,268
你為何這樣對我？
Why did you do this to me?

1281
02:08:17,775 --> 02:08:19,817
你到底是誰？
Who are you?

1282
02:08:22,654 --> 02:08:25,782
會沒事的，你懂嗎？沒事的
It's gonna be all right. You understand? It'll be all right.

1283
02:08:30,662 --> 02:08:32,789
不會有事的
It's gonna be all right.

1284
02:08:33,791 --> 02:08:35,416
好
Right.

1285
02:08:44,009 --> 02:08:47,637
這地址D層18單位 有一輛雪佛蘭科邁羅
There's this Camaro at this address, Level D, Slot 18.

1286
02:08:52,351 --> 02:08:54,394
這裏有現金
Here's some cash.

1287
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:58,147
這事什麼時候會結束？
When's it over?

1288
02:09:01,652 --> 02:09:03,194
22小時後
22 hours from now.

1289
02:09:03,654 --> 02:09:07,365
- 我們就可以脫身 - 你何時會讓我離開？
- Then we get out of here clean. - When will you let me leave?

1290
02:09:11,286 --> 02:09:14,163
你想走？現在可以走，門在那裏
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1291
02:09:14,832 --> 02:09:16,999
你之後會讓我離開嗎？
Will you let me leave later?

1292
02:09:22,089 --> 02:09:24,298
情況會不同
It will be different.

1293
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:27,510
你明白嗎？
Do you understand?

1294
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,542
準備好了
It's ready.

1295
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:01,544
文森
Vincent.

1296
02:10:06,967 --> 02:10:09,135
這是我的朋友雷夫
This is my friend Ralph.

1297
02:10:09,303 --> 02:10:11,262
你沒有告訴我你有···
You didn't tell me you were...

1298
02:10:12,347 --> 02:10:15,224
- 我的天 - 蘿倫呢？
- Oh, my God. - Where's Lauren?

1299
02:10:15,392 --> 02:10:18,603
- 她在麗莎貝絲家 - 聽著，這事和我無關
- She's at Lisa-Beth's. - Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1300
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:22,690
- 我不知道她結婚了，我很抱歉 - 你抱歉什麼，坐下
- I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry. - What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1301
02:10:23,358 --> 02:10:25,401
你不生氣嗎？
Don't you even get angry?

1302
02:10:25,569 --> 02:10:28,070
我生氣，是的
I'm angry, yeah.

1303
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:30,656
我很生氣，雷夫
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1304
02:10:30,824 --> 02:10:33,910
你知道嗎？如果你想要上我太太 而且她同意，你可以上
You know, you can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1305
02:10:35,496 --> 02:10:38,581
你可以躺在她的沙發上
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1306
02:10:39,917 --> 02:10:42,210
可以待在她前夫的
In her ex-husband's...

1307
02:10:42,377 --> 02:10:47,423
低科技、後現代主義的荒謬家中 如果你想要的話
...dead-tech, post-modernistic, bullshit house, if you want to...

1308
02:10:49,259 --> 02:10:55,598
但你不能看我該死的電視機
...but you do not get to watch my fucking television set!

1309
02:10:55,766 --> 02:10:57,266
有沒有搞錯！
For God's sake.

1310
02:11:03,815 --> 02:11:05,608
把電視機放下
Put the television set down.

1311
02:11:05,776 --> 02:11:08,319
- 我從沒對你不忠，賤人 - 也許你應該
- I never cheated on you, bitch. - Maybe you should have.

1312
02:11:08,487 --> 02:11:10,780
- 我應該嗎？ - 這不是你自找的嗎？
- I should have? - In a way, you're a party to this.

1313
02:11:10,948 --> 02:11:13,991
對，是我要雷夫干你 因為這樣我會很開心
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good.

1314
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:15,326
我們的處境很荒謬
Our situation is absurd.

1315
02:11:17,037 --> 02:11:21,874
- 聽著，也許我應該··· - 閉嘴，雷夫，坐下！
- Look, maybe I should... - Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!

1316
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:27,880
為什麼總是我得搞清楚我們之間的事 並向你解釋？你做了什麼？
Why is it that I have to figure things out and explain them to you? What do you do?

1317
02:11:28,048 --> 02:11:31,884
- 我不拐彎抹角，而且我說到做到 - 真令人敬佩
- I say what I mean, and I do what I say. - Mm, how admirable.

1318
02:11:32,052 --> 02:11:34,136
- 是的 - 除了和我們有關的事以外
- You bet. - Except none of it's about us.

1319
02:11:34,972 --> 02:11:36,013
不
No.

1320
02:11:37,474 --> 02:11:41,060
我也許沉溺於大麻和百憂解之中
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac...

1321
02:11:41,228 --> 02:11:43,854
但你在我們的生活中如同死了
...but you've been walking through our life dead.

1322
02:11:44,022 --> 02:11:48,693
我得自貶身價，找上雷夫 以便終斷我們的關係
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1323
02:12:01,248 --> 02:12:03,499
護照、旅行支票、信用卡
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1324
02:12:04,167 --> 02:12:09,005
在洛杉磯機場包機站十七號機庫
The plane, charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1325
02:12:09,172 --> 02:12:10,923
呼叫信號是1011S
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1326
02:12:14,303 --> 02:12:18,014
飛機會降落，等你五分鐘後便會起飛
Touches down, holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1327
02:12:18,181 --> 02:12:21,684
飛機會通過航空局檢查等手續
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.

1328
02:12:23,687 --> 02:12:26,022
- 克裏斯呢？ - 他走了
- Hey, where's Chris? - He's gone.

1329
02:12:27,482 --> 02:12:28,524
什麼？
What?

1330
02:12:29,151 --> 02:12:31,694
他說他要去找夏琳
Said he's going on his own. Went to look for Charlene.

1331
02:12:31,862 --> 02:12:34,697
- 你不是把他帶來了這裏了？ - 我有
- Didn't you bring him here? - Yeah, I brought him here.

1332
02:12:35,157 --> 02:12:36,991
怎麼回事？
What happened?

1333
02:12:37,159 --> 02:12:39,535
這是個自由國家
It's a free country, brother.

1334
02:12:43,957 --> 02:12:48,377
晚上九點聯絡我，確保一切妥當
Check in with me at 9. Everything's still cool.

1335
02:12:49,713 --> 02:12:51,380
好
All right.

1336
02:13:13,945 --> 02:13:16,906
我已經不知道自己在做什麼
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

1337
02:13:19,785 --> 02:13:21,994
我知道人生苦短
I know life is short.

1338
02:13:22,245 --> 02:13:24,872
能活多久是運氣
Whatever time you get is luck.

1339
02:13:27,084 --> 02:13:29,168
你想離開？
You wanna walk?

1340
02:13:31,421 --> 02:13:33,714
你現在就離開
You walk right now.

1341
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,926
不然就你自願···
Or on your own...

1342
02:13:37,094 --> 02:13:40,137
你選擇自願跟我走
On your own, you choose to come with me.

1343
02:13:46,228 --> 02:13:48,270
我只知道
All I know is...

1344
02:13:50,065 --> 02:13:54,402
到任何地方去對我都無所謂
All I know is there's no point in me going anywhere anymore...

1345
02:13:54,945 --> 02:13:57,029
如果我得獨自一人
...if it's gonna be alone...

1346
02:13:57,948 --> 02:13:59,740
沒有你在身邊
...without you.

1347
02:14:06,581 --> 02:14:08,165
伊迪
Eady.

1348
02:14:57,883 --> 02:15:00,342
- 是 - 文森，我們準備行動
- Yeah. - Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1349
02:15:01,052 --> 02:15:02,678
好，我等
Okay, I'll hold.

1350
02:15:05,348 --> 02:15:06,724
親愛的，讓克裏斯看見你吧
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1351
02:15:07,851 --> 02:15:09,685
- 是啊，快去做 - 住口！
- Yeah, do it. - Shut up!

1352
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:16,650
只需要在窗前站一秒
Now, just one second at the window...

1353
02:15:17,444 --> 02:15:19,195
此事就會了結
...and it's all over.

1354
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,848
夥計
Hey, man.

1355
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:13,058
- 是？ - 你知道···
- Yeah? - You know any, uh...

1356
02:17:13,226 --> 02:17:16,020
這附近有地方出租嗎？
...place to rent around here?

1357
02:17:17,105 --> 02:17:18,230
有
Yeah.

1358
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:20,983
載爾大道上的亞伯理茲雜貨店 牆上有招租告示
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.

1359
02:17:21,151 --> 02:17:22,192
好，謝謝
Yeah, thanks.

1360
02:17:33,413 --> 02:17:36,081
不是他，不是克裏斯
It's not him. It's not Chris.

1361
02:17:43,757 --> 02:17:45,883
第二小組，這是指揮部
Unit 2, this is Command.

1362
02:17:46,051 --> 02:17:48,719
攔阻他並查看身份
Take him at the street and check him out.

1363
02:17:48,887 --> 02:17:50,387
收到
10-4.

1364
02:18:13,828 --> 02:18:15,788
- 警官？ - 是
- Sergeant? - Yeah.

1365
02:18:15,956 --> 02:18:18,540
這人叫約翰彼得森，駕照有效
This guy's John Peterson. Valid ID.

1366
02:18:18,708 --> 02:18:22,461
車輛登記人是金布考斯基
Car's registered to the last name Bukowski, first name Gene.

1367
02:18:22,629 --> 02:18:25,506
向監理所查過，沒有不妥
Ran it to DMV. It's clean.

1368
02:18:28,218 --> 02:18:31,053
- 讓他走 - 知道
- Let him go. - Roger.

1369
02:18:31,221 --> 02:18:33,555
非常謝謝，晚安
Thank you very much. Have a good evening.

1370
02:18:35,308 --> 02:18:37,267
不是他，文森
It's a no-go, Vince.

1371
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:49,154
薛哈利斯太太，我們在等的時候 要喝杯咖啡嗎？
Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1372
02:18:49,322 --> 02:18:51,407
可以的話就太好了
Yeah, that'd be nice.

1373
02:19:21,396 --> 02:19:23,397
- 是？ - 有什麼消息？
- Yeah? - Yeah, what do you got?

1374
02:19:23,565 --> 02:19:25,649
沒事發生
Nothing's happening.

1375
02:19:36,953 --> 02:19:40,289
- 是？ - 是文森
- Yeah? - Hello, it's Vincent.

1376
02:19:40,457 --> 02:19:41,457
有何動靜？
What do you got?

1377
02:19:41,624 --> 02:19:45,961
沒有，韋恩葛羅去拿冰塊，就這樣
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice. That's it.

1378
02:19:54,304 --> 02:19:56,138
你知道嗎？
You know what?

1379
02:19:58,141 --> 02:20:00,184
尼爾走了
Neil is gone.

1380
02:20:02,395 --> 02:20:04,021
磅
Bam!

1381
02:20:04,606 --> 02:20:08,025
- 像鳥兒般飛走 - 文森，你怎麼知道？
- Flying like a bird. - Come on, Vincent, how do you know?

1382
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:13,363
- 我們仍有誘餌，也許還有時間！ - 有，我們有什麼？
- We still got bait. Maybe some time! - Got, got. What do we got?

1383
02:20:13,531 --> 02:20:15,365
我們有什麼？
What do we got?

1384
02:20:15,784 --> 02:20:18,452
旅途愉快，雜種
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1385
02:20:19,162 --> 02:20:21,371
你很行
You were good.

1386
02:20:22,457 --> 02:20:23,999
我要去住旅館
I'm going to the hotel.

1387
02:20:25,418 --> 02:20:27,878
我要去洗澡
I'm gonna take a shower.

1388
02:20:28,463 --> 02:20:31,965
睡一個月的覺
Gonna sleep for a month.

1389
02:22:41,888 --> 02:22:43,680
用這個
Over here.

1390
02:22:50,355 --> 02:22:52,272
寶貝，快醒來
Come on, baby.

1391
02:22:54,234 --> 02:22:56,526
好，好
Okay, okay.

1392
02:22:59,989 --> 02:23:01,949
該死
Shit.

1393
02:23:02,825 --> 02:23:04,826
讓我綁緊
Let me tighten this.

1394
02:23:10,333 --> 02:23:12,334
這樣浪費生命
What a fucking waste.

1395
02:23:12,502 --> 02:23:14,836
好，這裏
Okay, here.

1396
02:23:15,672 --> 02:23:21,385
渾蛋經常自毀，你不會死的 寶貝，你不會的
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day. Not you, baby. Not you.

1397
02:23:26,224 --> 02:23:29,685
她會在哪裏？她叫蘿倫 蘿倫古絲塔芙森
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.

1398
02:23:29,852 --> 02:23:32,104
她應該在這裏，但警方告訴我···
I'm supposed to be here with her. But the police...

1399
02:23:39,028 --> 02:23:42,197
- 我需要人幫忙··· - 沒關係，我可以
- Help me. I need somebody to help... - It's okay.

1400
02:23:43,658 --> 02:23:45,242
我抱著你
I got you.

1401
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:49,037
我抱著你，寶貝
I got you, baby.

1402
02:23:50,373 --> 02:23:53,709
你會沒事的，親愛的 會沒事的，我保證
It'll be all right, honey. I swear. It's okay, baby.

1403
02:23:53,876 --> 02:23:57,921
找醫生來！我要醫生！你媽媽在這
Let's get a doctor! Let's go! A doctor here! There's your mama.

1404
02:23:58,089 --> 02:23:59,965
- 冷靜下來 - 你媽媽在這
- Let's just calm down. - Your mama's here.

1405
02:24:00,133 --> 02:24:01,967
- 她有服用藥物嗎？ - 沒有
- Is she on any drugs? - No.

1406
02:24:04,887 --> 02:24:07,681
找創傷及血管外科醫生來
I want you to get a trauma surgeon and a vascular surgeon.

1407
02:24:07,849 --> 02:24:11,101
她好像割斷了兩條動脈，幾乎沒有脈搏
I think she cut both arteries. Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

1408
02:24:11,269 --> 02:24:14,604
她的血壓和呼吸下降，要給她插管
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration. You have to intubate her.

1409
02:24:14,772 --> 02:24:16,481
準備好了
It's ready.

1410
02:24:17,984 --> 02:24:21,153
- 最後一次任何人見到她是何時？ - 我不知道
- When's the last time anybody saw her? - I don't know.

1411
02:24:21,321 --> 02:24:24,406
- 你在哪裏找到她的？ - 浴缸
- Where did you find her? - The bathtub.

1412
02:24:24,574 --> 02:24:28,118
叫呼吸科，給她注射大針管的鹽水
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore normal saline. Wide open.

1413
02:24:28,286 --> 02:24:31,413
持續對出血的血管施壓 需要兩公升O型血
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders. I need two units, O-negative.

1414
02:24:31,581 --> 02:24:34,624
- 查出她血型和再輸六公升 - 似乎有竇性心搏過速
- Let's type and cross her for six. - Looks like she's in sinus tach.

1415
02:24:34,792 --> 02:24:36,668
呼吸專家呢？我們需要幫忙
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.

1416
02:24:36,836 --> 02:24:38,628
快叫呼吸科醫生過來
Can you have Respiratory come now?

1417
02:24:38,796 --> 02:24:41,506
準備插管後照胸腔X光
Let's have x-ray ready for post-intubation chest x-ray.

1418
02:24:46,512 --> 02:24:51,141
令嬡己完成手術，現在在恢復室
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1419
02:24:51,309 --> 02:24:55,479
她情況穩定 醫生很快會出來跟你們解釋
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will be out to speak to you in a few moments.

1420
02:24:55,646 --> 02:24:57,522
- 她沒事吧？ - 她很好
- She's okay? - She's doing good.

1421
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:59,858
- 她會沒事的 - 她會沒事的
- She's gonna be okay. - She's gonna be okay.

1422
02:25:00,026 --> 02:25:02,903
- 她不會有事 - 我的寶貝
- Oh, my baby. - She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1423
02:25:03,071 --> 02:25:06,198
- 沒事了 - 她為何這樣對自己？
- It's all right. - Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

1424
02:25:06,366 --> 02:25:10,577
看她把自己怎麼了
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1425
02:25:11,621 --> 02:25:13,455
別難過
There.

1426
02:25:13,873 --> 02:25:16,792
沒事的，不會有事的
It's all right, honey. It's gonna be all right.

1427
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:19,002
我在這裏，我哪裏也不去
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1428
02:25:19,170 --> 02:25:20,212
- 明白嗎？ - 好
- You understand? - Yeah.

1429
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:22,464
我哪裏也不去
I ain't going anywhere.

1430
02:25:35,269 --> 02:25:36,269
是？
Yeah?

1431
02:25:36,771 --> 02:25:37,771
是我
It's me.

1432
02:25:38,356 --> 02:25:41,608
飛機己在半空，會準時抵達
Plane's in the air now. It'll be right on time.

1433
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:45,821
仍找不到可信任的司機
On the driver's end, I still can't find nobody, so that's in the trust.

1434
02:25:45,988 --> 02:25:47,864
還有一事
One other thing.

1435
02:25:48,324 --> 02:25:49,908
你既然問了，我就告訴你
You asked, so I gotta tell you.

1436
02:25:50,743 --> 02:25:53,620
你要找的人在馬奎斯酒店 化名「詹姆森」
The guy you wanted checked into the Marquis under "Jameson"...

1437
02:25:53,788 --> 02:25:57,165
如果你還在乎他的話 我猜你不會想找他
...if you still give a shit, which I figured you wouldn't.

1438
02:25:57,333 --> 02:26:01,086
- 你說得對 - 再見，兄弟
- You figured right. - So, so long, brother.

1439
02:26:02,797 --> 02:26:04,756
保重了
You take it easy.

1440
02:26:04,924 --> 02:26:06,508
你就要到終點了
You're home free.

1441
02:26:08,261 --> 02:26:10,220
保重
Take it easy.

1442
02:26:20,565 --> 02:26:23,316
- 怎麼了？ - 沒什麼
- What is it? - Nothing.

1443
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:25,026
終點
Home free.

1444
02:27:02,982 --> 02:27:05,901
- 我得解決一些事情 - 有時間嗎？
- I gotta take care of something. - Is there time?

1445
02:27:06,903 --> 02:27:08,570
有的
There's time.

1446
02:27:36,974 --> 02:27:40,101
我很快回來，車子不要熄火
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1447
02:28:21,519 --> 02:28:23,979
- 入住登記 - 是，這是客房服務
- Registration. - Yeah, this is Room Service.

1448
02:28:24,146 --> 02:28:27,983
一個叫詹姆森的點了培根生菜三明治 但房號弄錯了，可以告訴我嗎？
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up his room number. Could you give it to me?

1449
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:30,026
- 他們經常弄錯 - 是，我知道
- They're always doing that. - Yeah, I know.

1450
02:28:30,194 --> 02:28:33,280
- 是1735號房 - 謝謝
- 1735. - Thank you.

1451
02:30:16,759 --> 02:30:18,468
請注意
Your attention, please.

1452
02:30:18,636 --> 02:30:21,888
我們現在有火災警報
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1453
02:30:22,056 --> 02:30:25,433
請不要驚慌，請不要乘坐電梯
Please do not panic. Please do not take the elevators.

1454
02:30:29,438 --> 02:30:32,065
- 該死 - 韋恩葛羅沒有動靜，我留在這
- Shit. - Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.

1455
02:30:32,233 --> 02:30:35,819
我去查看樓梯，如果有煙，會叫你離開
I'm checking the stairs. If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

1456
02:30:40,116 --> 02:30:42,534
她父親呢？要我通知她父親嗎？
What about her dad? You want me to call him?

1457
02:30:43,536 --> 02:30:46,371
他在內華達山某處
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1458
02:30:47,832 --> 02:30:49,999
而且她選了你
And she chose you.

1459
02:30:52,002 --> 02:30:54,379
選在你的房間自殺
She picked your place.

1460
02:30:55,923 --> 02:30:57,403
這種事不應該發生在她身上
It's not right, what happened to her.

1461
02:30:59,051 --> 02:31:00,385
是的，不應該
No, it's not.

1462
02:31:03,806 --> 02:31:05,849
是的
Ugh, okay.

1463
02:31:16,026 --> 02:31:18,153
有沒有辦法···
Is there any way...

1464
02:31:20,114 --> 02:31:22,615
能克服我們之間的問題？
...that it could work out between us?

1465
02:31:24,994 --> 02:31:27,579
我希望能說有
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1466
02:31:27,747 --> 02:31:31,040
可是終究···
But in the end...

1467
02:31:35,504 --> 02:31:37,672
像你說的
You know, it's like you said:

1468
02:31:40,384 --> 02:31:45,054
我一生全奉獻給被我追捕的罪犯
All I am, is what I'm going after.

1469
02:31:51,937 --> 02:31:54,856
我不是你想要的人，賈絲汀
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1470
02:32:05,326 --> 02:32:07,952
如果你需要走就走吧
Well, go on, if you have to.

1471
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:09,704
不
No.

1472
02:32:09,997 --> 02:32:13,208
- 我可以留下來 - 我沒事，我可以應付
- I'll stay. - No, I'm okay. I can... I can handle this.

1473
02:32:16,378 --> 02:32:18,379
你自己小心
Just be careful.

1474
02:32:18,631 --> 02:32:21,382
打電話到這裏給我，讓我知道你沒事
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1475
02:32:22,301 --> 02:32:23,843
好嗎？
Okay?

1476
02:33:05,719 --> 02:33:06,761
走樓梯
Take the stairs.

1477
02:33:20,734 --> 02:33:21,776
誰？
Yeah?

1478
02:33:23,988 --> 02:33:28,157
酒店保全，三樓發生火警 各樓層的人都得疏散
Security. There's a fire on 3. We have to evacuate all the floors.

1479
02:33:28,325 --> 02:33:29,951
我不能離開
I can't leave here.

1480
02:33:38,836 --> 02:33:42,255
我們何不先談一下？
Why don't we just talk about this a bit, huh, brother?

1481
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:57,312
他在17樓
He's here on 17.

1482
02:34:00,482 --> 02:34:02,817
看著我，看著我
Look at me. Look at me.

1483
02:34:06,155 --> 02:34:07,322
看著我
Look at me.

1484
02:34:39,229 --> 02:34:43,107
洛城警察，別動！手放在頭上！
L.A.P.D. Don't move. Put your hands on your head, now.

1485
02:35:18,227 --> 02:35:20,561
將我換到五號頻道
Switch me to TAC 5.

1486
02:35:20,729 --> 02:35:23,064
卡薩爾？ J J ？
Casals? JJ?

1487
02:35:23,983 --> 02:35:25,191
卓克，J J ？
Drucker, JJ?

1488
02:35:25,359 --> 02:35:27,902
文森，我在大廳的樓梯旁
I'm at the lobby level by the stairwell.

1489
02:35:28,070 --> 02:35:29,070
有什麼消息？
What have you got?

1490
02:35:29,238 --> 02:35:32,407
小組得乘坐其他的電梯去17樓
Teams are moving up the other elevators to the 17th floor elevators.

1491
02:35:32,574 --> 02:35:34,742
因為火警，電梯不能使用
All out of commission because of the fire alarm.

1492
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:38,037
- 現場一團混亂 - 好，收到
- It's a mess. People everywhere. - Fine. 10-4.

1493
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:09,444
趕快離開
Let's go, get out of the way.

1494
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:11,529
不要擋路
Stay out of the way.

1495
02:36:19,455 --> 02:36:22,498
快，走那邊，好嗎？快點
Let's go. Go that way. We gotta go, all right? Go, go.

1496
02:36:25,627 --> 02:36:27,545
我知道了，長官
I got it, sir.

1497
02:36:29,673 --> 02:36:31,591
快點，快點
Come on, come on.

1498
02:36:37,431 --> 02:36:39,057
快走，先生
Come on, sir.

1499
02:36:43,312 --> 02:36:46,314
- 小心後面，女士們 - 我知道了
- Watch your backs, ladies. - I got it, I got it.

1500
02:36:48,984 --> 02:36:50,651
繼續走，夫人
Keep moving, ma'am.

1501
02:36:51,487 --> 02:36:52,570
走
Let's go.

1502
02:36:55,074 --> 02:36:56,324
繼續走
Come on, let's go.

1503
02:37:30,943 --> 02:37:32,610
走這邊，夫人
This way, ma'am.

1504
02:37:34,571 --> 02:37:36,364
後退，後退
Get back, get back.

1505
02:38:02,224 --> 02:38:04,642
- 把散彈鎗給我 - 是的，長官
- Let me have that shotgun. - Yes, sir.

1506
02:44:22,103 --> 02:44:24,855
我告訴過你，我不會回去坐牢的
Told you I'm never going back.

1507
02:44:28,193 --> 02:44:29,818
沒錯
Yeah.

1508
02:50:14,915 --> 02:50:15,916
