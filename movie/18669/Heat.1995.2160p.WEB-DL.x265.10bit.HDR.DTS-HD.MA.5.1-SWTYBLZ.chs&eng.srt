100
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,708
他有保险

101
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:15,828
这就是重点  他能拿到百分百的保险赔偿
That's the point. He collects 100 percent from the insurance.

102
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:18,528

He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds back from us...

103
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:22,698

A score he's putting out, he wants you to look at.

109
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:38,548
我不需要他的行动，我自己有买卖
I don't need his score. I got my own.

还是留给分局？
Or does it stay in Division?

123
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:53,808
你觉得这像是少年犯罪团伙抢劫7-11便利店吗？
Does this look like gangbangers working the local 7-11 to you?

124
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,858

We got three motorists. All they saw were men with masks. They were distant.

130
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:16,748
根据电视台那边的说法，这人开始顶嘴
Right. Now, According to TV man, this guy started mouthing off.

131
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:17,948
聪明
Smart.

132
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,518
有人叫一个警卫“滑头”
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

133
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:21,318
- 滑头？

139
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:37,868
这人看起来是胸骨遭到双发射击造成的伤口
This guy here has got what appears to be a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

140
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:43,178
头部伤口形成的纹路，灼焦的骨头，近距离  可能是处决
Tattooing around the head wound, scorched bones, close range.Probably executed.

141
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:47,208
160万的不记名债券
It was a million six in bearer bonds.

142
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,118
他们放弃了零散现金
They ignored the loose cash.

143
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,918
因为他们没时间，他们是有计时的准备
'Cause they had no time. They were on a clock.

144
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,948
意味着他们知道我们对211的反应时间
Which means they knew our response time to a 211.

145
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,688
听我们的广播，把车截停，进入…
had our air, immobilized it, entered...

146
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,688
逃走，在三分钟以内
...escaped in under three minutes.

147
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:03,628
这是个作案的好地点，有上佳的逃跑路线
It's a good spot here. We got good escape routes.

148
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,028
两条高速公路…
Two freeways...

149
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,668
在四分一英里之内
within a quarter of a mile.

150
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,028
交通摄像机呢？
Traffic video camera?

151
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,498
可能给弄坏了，还是先查一下
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

152
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:12,128
你认得出作案手法吗？
You recognize the M. O?

153
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,388
M. O: modus operandi 犯罪手法

154
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,398
手法…
M. O...

155
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,298
就是他们很专业
is that they're good.

156
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:19,808
事况在当时恶化成一级谋杀罪  杀了两个警卫后…
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all of them, after they killed the first two guards.

157
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:20,878
他们没有迟疑
they didn't hesitate.

158
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:25,088
立马崩了第三名警卫，因为... 这样还有什么区别呢？
Popped guard number three because... what difference does it make?

159
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,318
为何还要留下一个活生生的目击证人呢？
Why leave a living witness?

160
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:30,388
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
瞬间这些人就坐立不安要掀房顶了
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

161
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:35,028
成型装药定向破门弹（定向炸药）
The shape charge.

162
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:39,098
从炸药可以看出他们可是技术专家
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.

163
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,968
能大胆在运输途中犯案
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

164
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,968
着手查询一下最近棘手的盗窃重案
So let's start looking for recent high-line burglaries that mystify us.

165
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:48,608
去找FBI查找“滑头”的别名，你会得到一长串电话名单
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI. You're gonna get the phone book.

166
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,578
还是去查一查   谁负责转移不记名债券？
Do it anyway. Who's moving the bearer bonds?

167
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,548
查查销赃惯犯，你和我查库泽马诺和特瑞纳
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cuzomano and Torena.

168
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:59,048
我要你查高斯汀和阿尔法罗
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

169
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,618
和法医部门保持联络
Hang in with Forensics.

170
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,448
我要你们从防爆小组那里查出这爆炸物
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

171
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:06,488
运气好，是别国产品的话，我们就能查出销路来源
If we're lucky, it's exotic. We can trace the sale.

172
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,758
把手从那人的口袋里抽出来,瑞秋
Get your hand out of that man's pocket, Rachel.

173
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,368
有人要馅饼吗？
Anyone want some pie?

174
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,608
我去上个厕所
Gotta go to the john.

175
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:06,258
我不得不开枪  他有动了  我没法
I had to get it on. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

176
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:22,998
钱分好了在车上  我从每人款项里匀了同样的钱出来
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

177
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:26,368
来补上他的余款
to make up for his full end.

178
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:31,168
因为我想立马付完钱就让这龟孙子滚蛋
'cause I want to pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

179
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:10,948
慢着！
Hold it!

180
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:52,418
其余的钱呢？
Where's the rest?

181
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,288
我们晚了  你这么美我可舍不得你出门
We're late. You look too good to go out.

182
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,558
我要钻进你怀里
I could just jump you right here.

183
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,728
- 钱在哪儿？　　　　　　　
- 给赌马经纪加注去了，宝贝
- Where is it? - Squared the bookies, baby.

184
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:07,268
几天后还会有更多的钱，别再逼问了  我们迟到了
There's more in a couple of days, so don't sweat it. We're late.

185
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:08,268
是吗，得了吧
Yeah, come on.

186
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,028
你在跟我开玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

187
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:12,468
亲爱的…
Honey...

188
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:17,708
为了8千元冒这些险根本不值得  回报与风险应该同比
it ain't worth the risks you take for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

189
00:22:17,908 --> 00:22:18,848
我们走吧
Let's go.

190
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,448
去穿好外衣
Get your coat.

191
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,548
白费口舌，你就是个年纪大点儿的孩子罢了
There is no point talking. You're a child growing older.

192
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,268
那是什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,558
意思是我们毫无进展，不像普通成年人那样生活
It means We're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults living our lives.

194
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,158
是因为我嫁给了一个油盐不进的赌棍
because I married a gambling junkie who won't listen.

195
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,028
莎琳，你快他妈给我上车
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

196
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:40,368
我处这种狗屎情形之下是为了干吗？
What am I doing in this rat-bastard situation?

197
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:41,058
你不必！
You're not!

198
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:42,188
你到底要我怎样？
What you want for me?

199
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:45,538
你出门的时候把存折和车钥匙留在厨房吗？
leave the bank book and the car keys in the kitchen on your way out the door?

200
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:49,568
- 我们一起走吗，还是我一个人去？　
- 留着你那废话吧，多米尼克要跟我过
- Are we going , or am I going alone? - Keep that other crap but Dominick would go with me.

201
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:53,348
想都别想…
Don't even think about...

202
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:20,438
是  告诉我阿尔伯特·特瑞纳回电话了
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

203
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:23,578

爆炸物是直线型填装炸药，用作拆毁
The explosive was Dy-Ex, linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

208
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,788
凭借驾照就能在内华达、亚利桑拿和新墨西哥州买到
You can pick it up with a driver's license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

209
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:36,818
太普通难以追查来源
Too common to trace a sale.

210
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:38,788
真是好极了
That's wonderful.

211
00:23:59,068 --> 00:23:59,968
你没事吧？
You all right?

212

Didn't call didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

216
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,468
这人知不知道这孩子的情况？
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with this kid?

217
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,198
我不知道
I don't know.

218
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:24,668
他妈的混蛋
Fucking jerk.

219
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,638
她还好吗？

她整天待在房间里

226
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:48,928

00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:18,508
喜欢这儿吗？
You like it?

274
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,338
不太喜欢，来这儿主要是为了工作
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

275
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,748
住在附近？
Live in this neighborhood?

276
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:36,618
不，我住在...日落广场上面附近
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

277
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:40,088
实际上是...是我租的一所小房子
It's actually kind of a...it's a little house I rent.

278
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,258
稍有些破旧，但能望见很美的风景
And it's kind of rundown, but a beautiful, beautiful view.

279
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:46,528
你呢？
What about you?

280
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,868
我住在这儿
I live up here.

281
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,668
很有趣
That's very funny.

282
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:56,208
你的家族源于哪儿？
Where's your family from originally?

00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:00,378
苏格兰-爱尔兰

285
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,728

288
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:20,138
母亲很久前死了，我父亲…
My mother died a long time ago, and my father...

289
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:21,828
我不知他在哪儿
I don't know where he is.

290
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:23,568
我还有个兄弟在某个地方
Got a brother somewhere.

291
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:31,498
你和家人之间关系很牢固，我能看得出
You have a tight family. I can tell.

292
00:29:31,998 --> 00:29:32,678
是啊
Yeah.

293
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,808
对吗？
Right?

294
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,318
你说得对
You're right.

295
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,758
光明之城
City of lights...

296
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,798
在斐济，有一种…
In Fiji, they have these...

297
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,608
闪着光的海藻，每年浮出水面一次
...iridescent algae that come out once a year in the water.

298
00:29:56,758 --> 00:29:58,968
那边就是描述的这样美
That's what it looks like out there.

299
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:01,508
你去过？
You been there?

300
00:30:02,838 --> 00:30:04,778
没有，总有一天会去的
No, I'm going there some day.

301
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:15,218
你常旅游？
You travel a lot?

302
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:18,988
是的
Yeah.

303
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:21,358
旅行让你寂寞了？
Travelling makes you lonely?

304
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,468
我独身，但不…
I'm alone. I am not...

305
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:30,198
不寂寞
lonely.

306
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,598
你呢？
You?

307
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,608
真心寂寞
Real lonely.

308
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:40,828
阿尔伯特！
Albert!

309
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:44,468
糟糕！
Shit!

310
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:45,468
阿尔伯特
Al-bert

311
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,868
文森，老兄你来这找我干嘛？疯了吗？
Vinsen, man, why are you here for me? You crazy?

312
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:51,408
- 这里不是迪士尼乐园
- 你昨晚该回我电话的
-This ain't Disneyland. -You were supposed to get back to me last night.

313
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:53,408
你他妈去哪儿了？
Where the fuck you been?

314
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:56,008
我抽不出身来，文森，你知道的
I couldn't break free, Vinsen, you know.

315
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,148
现在我们来侵犯他的狗屁民权吧
Let's violate his ass right now.

316
00:32:58,308 --> 00:32:59,808
我帮忙你…
I do for you...

317
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,488
你却不帮我，是这样吗？
...you don't do for me, is that it?

318
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:07,698
听着，兄弟，我发誓，我整晚在外面  像个斗牛士一样打斗
Listen, man. I swear, I was out all night. I'm hitting like one of them flamingo-matador guys.

319
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:09,648
此事和我毫无关系
That's got nothing to do with me.

320
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:14,278
我干得挺顺的  正给你搞些线索什么的
I was cutting it real smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you.

321
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:15,878
- 你知道我很卖力的，老兄
- 狗屎　　　　　　　　　
- I'm a dancer, man, you know. - You bullshit.

322
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:19,098
我一整天传呼你个屁人，我可受不了他妈的传呼人
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand fucking paging.

323
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:21,768
你个瘾君子，又注射冰毒了
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

324
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:24,778
老兄，你的同情心呢？这是滥用药物问题
Where's your empathy? It's a substance abuse problem.

325
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,508
同情心留在昨天  今天你他妈在浪费我的时间
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

326
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:30,578
- 文森．．．
- 你恋爱了？
-Vinsen...  -You fall in love?

327
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:32,768
说吧  你昨晚是不是恋爱去了…
Come on. Did you fall in love last night...

328
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,188
- 然后到别处去？
- 文森　　　　　
- and went off somewhere? - Vinsen

329
00:33:35,188 --> 00:33:37,778
告诉我好了，我会接受的  我会买账
Just tell me that, I'll settle for it. I'll buy then.

330
00:33:39,788 --> 00:33:41,258
把你弄到的消息都给我！
Give me all you got!

331
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,188
都给我！
Give me all you got!

332
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:47,128
我发誓，老兄，我哥哥理查德会跟你说的
I swear, man. My brother Richard's going to talk to you.

333
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,958
我听见理查德？
I heard Richard?

334
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:51,528
- 他会和你说的
- 理查德？　　
-He's going to talk to you. -Richard?

335
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:52,598
- 理查德　
- 理查德？
-Richard. -Richard?

336
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,888
他会见你，老兄  我发誓，就在今晚
He's gonna meet you, man. I swear, tonight.

337
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,398
他人不在这儿，不是吗？
He's not here, is he?

338
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,948
是不在，但他今晚会见你
No, he'll meet you tonight.

339
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,568
今晚？现在不行吗？
Tonight? What happened to now?

340
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:03,948
我求过他了，因为我知道你今早会来
I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

341
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:04,688
鬼扯
Bullshit.

342
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,788
我发誓  他说不行…
I swear. He said no...

343
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:08,808
因为他在凤凰城
'cause he in Phoenix.

344
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:11,788
“等我到了凤凰城
"By the time I get to Phoenix

345
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:14,088
他会起程
"He'll be rising

346
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,778
他或留张字条
"He'll probably leave a note

347
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,488
贴在门上”
"Right on the door"

348
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,728
我最多只能给你安排在今晚
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

349
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:27,168
他在阿尔瓦拉多街BJ夜总会见你
You know. He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

350
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,338
凌晨两点
At 2:00 a.m.

351
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,508
到哪儿去
Be there.

352
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,168
你也要到场
You be there too.

353
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,118
文森，我不能去，老兄  我有事要办
Vinsen, I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

354
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:38,118
我有事办，要去别地儿
I got things to do, I got places to be.

355
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:40,518
给我去
Be there.

356
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,258
别他妈浪费我的时间！
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

357
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:54,198
是什么？
What is it?

358
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,198
是一家银行
It's a bank.

359
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:01,138
它星期四会存现金，以便分发各分行…
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

360
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:03,298
应付星期五的薪金支票
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

361
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,608
所以星期四总行库存丰沛
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

362
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,238
在途中还是硬来？
On the prowl or strong?

363
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:09,378
硬来  由正门
Strong. Through the door.

364
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:10,778
多少人？
How many guys?

365
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:14,668
大约四或三个，加上一个司机  你走进去，搞定他们，走出来
About four, or three, plus a driver. You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

366
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:18,078
你要预支十万，事成后分一成？
You want $100,000 in advance against a ten-percent cut for that?

367
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:20,558
听着倒像是牛仔的计划举动
Sounds like a cowboy score.

368
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,328
他们按响劫案警报器，我得在警察出现前离开，这算什么？
They hit the hold-up alarms, I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?

369
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,468
他们可以启动三个劫案警报器
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

370
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,568
两个固定的和一个移动的
Two Telco and a cellular.

371
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:34,308
讯号传不出去，因为…
See but the signals aren't going anywhere because...

372
00:35:34,628 --> 00:35:36,238
前一晚…
...the night before...

373
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,808
你潜进去…
...you cut in...

374
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,578
修改警报系统的电脑…
...and trick out the alarm system computer...

375
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,078
把它…
...to turn itself...

376
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,248
和录像设备关掉了…
...and the video recorders off...

377
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:46,558
在你下手前20分钟
20 minutes before you enter.

378
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,148
建筑及电路蓝图？
Architectural, electrical plans?

379
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:50,318
我拿到了
I got that.

380
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:53,398
我已经让人做好主板，接驳中央处理器
I got the boards already built. They go into the CPU.

381
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:56,228
估价是多少？
What's the estimate?

382
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,328
1210万到1220万
12.1, 12.2 million.

383
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:05,928
你说服我了
You're on.

384
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:08,338
恭喜
Congratulations.

385
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:12,308
我来给你展示下这笔钱怎么估出来的
Let me give you a little idea of where my estimates come from.

386
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,178
没人知道货是你的
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

387
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:18,878
我的办法，你从保险公司得到百分百赔偿
Be that as it may, My way, you get 100 percent from the insurance company

388
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,388
然后从我们这拿回债券
and take the bonds back from us.

389
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:24,018
以美元支付的60%，而你自己再赚40%
at 60 cents on the dollar and make yourself another 40 percent.

390
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,658
这运作没漏下一个环节  咱们都明白
The operation doesn't skip a beat. We all make out.

391
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:31,298
当然，你的交易成了
Sure, you got a deal.

392
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:35,238
好，要是每个人都不清楚分工的话何谈利益呢
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

393
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:38,898
对  让你的人给我打电话，我们安排会面
Yeah. so you have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

394
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:40,238
好，没问题
Yeah, okay.

395
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,508
很高兴和你交谈
Nice talking to you.

396
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,238
你要和这些人交易？
You gonna deal with these guys?

397
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:48,218
道上的说法 我可以偷自己的东西吗？
Word's on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

398
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,048
我会杀了这班婊子养的
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

399
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:54,648
让哈利把加那利群岛海外公司的电子表格给我
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Island's Offshore.

400
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,108
这些并不算是估计  是实在数字
That's not really an estimate. Those are exact figures.

401
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:05,328
我有银行过去两月现金流动的打印本
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow for the past two months.

402
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:07,268
你怎么得到的资料？
How'd you get this information?

403
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:08,698
送上门的
Just comes to you.

404
00:37:08,798 --> 00:37:10,048
这东西你看不见它的传播途径
This stuff just flies through the air.

405
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:14,798
这类信息被处发送到每个角落，你只需动手收集就行

我们第一次见他

622
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,778
还没开始跟踪他

623

你不知道这是什么

651
00:58:24,058 --> 00:58:26,008
我念小学时认识一个人

652
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:27,548
他叫拉乌尔
His name was Raoul.

653
00:58:28,098 --> 00:58:32,308
什么的，无所谓了  他可以把他的手指一只只叠起来
whatever. Anyway, the guy could take his fingers and fold them over each other.

654
00:58:32,568 --> 00:58:34,638
他可把眼睑向外翻…
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

655
00:58:34,808 --> 00:58:37,738
我没法把手从你身上拿开，真的
I can't keep my hands off you. That's the truth.

656
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:41,918
你吸引的地方在于你那…
That's what's so wonderful about you in that...

657
00:58:41,978 --> 00:58:43,648
兽性的方式
...bestial sort of way.

658
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:49,458
女人
Woman.

659
00:58:56,258 --> 00:58:58,238
最好是惊天动地的事
This better be earth-shattering.

660
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:06,508
为拉乌尔干杯
This is to Raoul.

661
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,508
我是文森特·汉纳
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

662
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:54,658
我们发现她时是这样的
Here's how we found her.

663
00:59:58,928 --> 00:59:59,828
多大？
How old?

664
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:02,558
十六七岁，在此约六小时
16, 17. Been here about six hours.

665
01:00:03,758 --> 01:00:05,238
她怎么死的，瑞秋？
How'd she die, Rachel?

666
01:00:05,328 --> 01:00:08,738
头部被重击，跟其他人一样  大脑血肿
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.

667
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:12,768
那是谁？
Who's that?

668
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:14,828
母亲及兄弟姐妹，我猜
Mother and siblings, I guess.

669
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:15,918
他们来干什么鬼？
What the hell are they doing here?

670
01:00:15,918 --> 01:00:19,548
已经一团乱了  内部有人认识这女孩，通知了家人
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

671
01:00:20,678 --> 01:00:21,848
好吧，我们开始
Okay, let's go.

672
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:27,688
不错
Nice.

673
01:00:28,588 --> 01:00:32,558
直觉告诉我，化验精液会发现是同一个人做的…
My intuition says the check on the semen will show it's the same guy...

674
01:00:32,658 --> 01:00:35,958
那就会是连环谋杀案，最终由你来负责
...so it's a series and ending up in your court.

675
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,998
治安官有头绪吗？
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

676
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:38,998
还没有
Not yet.

677
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:42,338
放开我！
Get off of me!

678
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:46,238
天啊！
Oh, my God!

679
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:51,158
她在哪儿？
Where is she?

680
01:00:51,198 --> 01:00:53,448
冷静！冷静！
Easy, easy, easy.

681
01:00:56,718 --> 01:00:58,188
求你，别这样
Please, come on.

682
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:02,958
没事的  没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

683
01:01:03,138 --> 01:01:07,058
我的孩子呢？她在哪？
Where is my baby? Where is she?

684
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:10,098
我要知道出了什么事
I need to know what happened.

685
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,408
我猜确实是惊天动地了
I guess the earth shattered.

686
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:58,018
你为何不让博斯克送你回家？
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

687
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:02,218
我也不想扫他们的兴
I didn't want to ruin their night too.

688
01:02:02,648 --> 01:02:03,988
是什么事？
What was it?

689
01:02:06,048 --> 01:02:07,548
你不想知道的
You don't want to know.

690
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:10,138
我想知道你铁青的脸孔后面藏着什么
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look on your face.

691
01:02:10,138 --> 01:02:13,408
我不会这么做  你知道的  我们走吧
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

692
01:02:13,498 --> 01:02:16,748
你从没告诉我，我会被拒诸事外
You never told me I'd be excluded.

693
01:02:18,658 --> 01:02:21,108
刚才在一起时我告诉过你，宝贝
I told you when we hooked up, baby.

694
01:02:21,148 --> 01:02:23,008
你不得不和我分享…
that you were gonna have to share me...

695
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:26,848
这星球上所有的坏人和丑行
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

696
01:02:27,008 --> 01:02:29,258
而我愿意那种分享…
And I bought into that sharing...

697
01:02:29,498 --> 01:02:31,078
因为我爱你
...because I love you.

698
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:34,088
我爱你发胖、秃头、有钱、没钱
I love you fat, bald, money, no money,

699
01:02:34,288 --> 01:02:35,348
开巴士
driving a bus.

700
01:02:35,478 --> 01:02:36,668
我不在乎
I don't care.

701
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:39,358
但你一定要出现
But you have got to be present

702
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:40,778
像个普通人那样，某些时候
like a normal guy, some other time.

703
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:43,978
那是分享  这不是分享，这是最后才想起
That's shareing. This is not shareing. This is leftover

704
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:46,988
我懂了  我应该这么做  回到家说：
I see. What I should do is come home and say:

705
01:02:47,258 --> 01:02:50,968
“嗨，亲爱的，你知道吗？我今天走进一所房子…
"Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

706
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:54,928
“有个吸毒的混蛋刚用微波炉炸了他的婴孩…
"where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

707
01:02:55,028 --> 01:02:58,498
因他哭的太吵闹，我和你分享吧
"because he was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

708
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:01,408
来，让我们分享此事  而在分享时…
Come on, let's share that and in sharing it...

709
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:06,708
我们莫名其妙就可以净化和驱散所有那些狗屎邪恶  ”
"we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit."

710
01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:07,818
对吗？
Right?

711
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:11,258
错
Wrong.

712
01:03:11,578 --> 01:03:12,788
你知道为什么？
You know why?

713
01:03:12,908 --> 01:03:14,998
因为你更喜欢日常公事
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

714
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:17,468
我们做完爱，你就失去说话的力气
We fuck and you lose the power of speech.

715
01:03:17,518 --> 01:03:19,688
因为我得控制住我的焦虑
'Cause I got to hold onto my angst.

716
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:21,838
保存起来
I preserve it.

717
01:03:21,968 --> 01:03:25,268
因为我需要它  它让我保持敏锐，如履薄冰
because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

718
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:27,068
我必须那样
Where I gotta be.

719
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:36,148
你没有和我一起生活
You don't live with me.

720
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:41,378
而是活在死人的残骸中
You live among the remains of dead people.

721
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:47,518
你查看地形
You read the terrain.

722
01:03:48,288 --> 01:03:50,738
你找寻逝去的迹象…
You search for signs of passing...

723
01:03:51,388 --> 01:03:53,458
找猎物的气味
for the scent of your prey.

724
01:03:53,528 --> 01:03:55,508
然后追捕他们
and then you hunt them down.

725
01:03:57,128 --> 01:03:59,838
这是你唯一投入的事
That's the only thing you're committed to.

726
01:04:03,268 --> 01:04:06,148
剩余的是你走过后留下的烂摊子
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

727
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:14,858
我不明白的是，为何摆脱不了你
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

728
01:04:30,598 --> 01:04:32,798
嘿，莉莉
Hey, Lily

729
01:04:34,598 --> 01:04:36,098
走吧，宝贝
Let's go, baby.

730
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:40,608
我见过那经理了
I met the manager.

731
01:04:41,008 --> 01:04:42,488
那是老板吗？
Is that the boss?

732
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:45,908
让我坐牢的罪恶，那个混蛋每天都在重复
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

733
01:04:46,478 --> 01:04:50,448
你能不能忍着，直到我们给你找到新工作吗？
Can you just handle it till we find you something new?

734
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:53,058
你能做到吗？
Can you do that?

735
01:04:55,118 --> 01:04:58,098
没有我忍受不了的艰难时刻
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

736
01:05:04,098 --> 01:05:06,408
你为何和我一起，莉莉安？
What you're hanging with me for, Lillian?

737
01:05:07,898 --> 01:05:09,808
因为我为你骄傲
Because I'm proud of you.

738
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,188
为我骄傲？
You're proud of me?

739
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:24,248
为了什么？
Why the hell are you proud of me?

740
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:27,228
回家吧
Come on home.

741
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:39,808
你在那里做什么？
What were you doing there?

742
01:05:39,998 --> 01:05:41,478
我滑雪
I was skiing.

743
01:05:41,668 --> 01:05:43,438
我试着滑雪
I was trying to ski.

744
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:46,438
人们去那里就是做这个  你去滑雪…
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

745
01:05:46,478 --> 01:05:49,848
...你与人相识
...and you meet people.

746
01:05:50,178 --> 01:05:51,778
试着开心
You try to have a good time.

747
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:53,518
- 你开心吗？
- 没　　　　
- Did you have a good time? - No.

748
01:05:53,578 --> 01:05:54,748
为什么？
Why not?

749
01:05:55,078 --> 01:05:57,058
我不擅长与人结交
I'm not good at meeting people.

750
01:05:57,518 --> 01:05:58,898
可你认识了我
You met me.

751
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:02,128
我没想过会发生
That happened without my thinking about it.

752
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,538
可能是我…
Which is why I probably...

753
01:06:05,158 --> 01:06:07,228
不，你很好
No, it's because you are fine.

754
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:14,538
伊迪，和我一起离开一阵子
Take off with me for a while.

755
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:16,878
去哪？
Where?

756
01:06:17,468 --> 01:06:18,878
新西兰
New Zealand.

757
01:06:20,178 --> 01:06:21,278
何时？
When?

758
01:06:22,948 --> 01:06:25,548
我得单独走，你可以在那里跟我会合
I have to go separate. You can meet me there.

759
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,528
但我的工作...
But my job...

760
01:06:27,618 --> 01:06:29,788
我有钱，你不需要
I got money. You don't need money.

761
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:32,358
你可以去那边开间工作室
You could set up a studio and work there.

762
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:33,988
我不知道
I don't know.

763
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:35,588
还要知道什么？
What's there to know?

764
01:06:35,728 --> 01:06:37,198
你结婚了吗？
Are you married?

765
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:39,898
什么？
What?

766
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:42,128
我就差结婚这件事了
The last thing I am is married.

767
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,398
我是一根从即将从零开始走的指针，一片空白
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way, and double blank

768
01:06:45,408 --> 01:06:47,108
突然间…
All of a sudden...

769
01:06:47,998 --> 01:06:50,068
你这样的人出现了
someone like you comes along.

770
01:06:53,738 --> 01:06:54,778
你不了解我，尼尔
You don't know me, Niel

771
01:06:54,788 --> 01:06:56,248
我足够了解
I know enough.

772
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:01,658
跟我走
Come with me.

773
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,998
怎么了，宝贝？
What's wrong, babe?

774
01:07:14,758 --> 01:07:17,608
没问题  都会好起来的  你会去吗？
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

775
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:23,608
是的
Yeah.

776
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:28,318
好
Good.

777
01:07:53,298 --> 01:07:54,708
亲爱的
Hi, sweetie.

778
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:58,548
你忘记妈妈会去接你吗？
You forget your mom was picking you up?

779
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:01,238
不是
No.

780
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:05,148
那是怎么回事？
So, what's going on?

781
01:08:06,978 --> 01:08:08,718
我想一人静静
I felt like being alone.

782
01:08:10,918 --> 01:08:13,558
来吧，我送你回家
Come on, I'll drive you home.

783
01:08:13,558 --> 01:08:15,558
- 嘿，麦克
- 嘿，萝伦
- Hey, Mike. - Hey, Lauren.

784
01:09:10,308 --> 01:09:11,518
有何动静？
What's happening?

785
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,418
长官
Sir.

786
01:09:14,478 --> 01:09:17,158
杰克森队长想知道情况
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

787
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:20,128
还没动静，不要用无线电
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

788
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:15,718
技术
Technique.

789
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:21,618
（IGM 投资高等级金属）

790
01:10:35,228 --> 01:10:37,228
芝麻开门  就在那
Open Sesame. Right there.

791
01:11:35,018 --> 01:11:36,428
就是他
There he is.

792
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:39,888
我们走！
We walk!

793
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:40,798
我快完事了
I'm there.

794
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:41,828
我们走！
We walk!

795
01:12:57,168 --> 01:12:58,508
他听到了
He's heard it.

796
01:13:06,918 --> 01:13:09,808
注意
Heads up.

797
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:11,988
- 出来一个　　
- 等一等，队长
- One's coming out. - Hold it, Captain.

798
01:13:12,048 --> 01:13:14,328
文森特，他没带着任何东西
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

799
01:13:14,618 --> 01:13:15,598
我看见了
I see.

800
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:19,488
我们上
Here we go.

801
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:23,998
等我老大命令，他们两都没拿什么东西
Not till my boss says so. Both of them are not carrying anything.

802
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:33,868
让他们走
Let them go.

803
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:35,098
你什么意思？我们可拘捕他们
What do you mean? We can take them on!

804
01:13:35,138 --> 01:13:36,878
以什么罪名？你打算起诉他们什么罪名？
On what? What are you going to take them on?

805
01:13:37,048 --> 01:13:39,178
破坏入口？ 他们还没偷什么
Breaking an entry?They didn't steal anything.

806
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:39,938
还不明白吗？
Don't you get it?

807
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,948
只会被定为鸡屎大的轻罪，他们待个6个月就出来了
It gets knocked back to some chickenshit misdemeanor, they do six months and they're out.

808
01:13:43,988 --> 01:13:44,968
决不能这样结果
No fucking way.

809
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,288
我不愿被我老板骂，就因为你放走他们
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.

810
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,518
他们不能走
They are not walking.

811
01:13:48,518 --> 01:13:52,128
他们就得走  他们会离开  这是我的行动
That's exactly what they'll do. They'll walk. This is my operation.

812
01:13:52,188 --> 01:13:54,998
我有战术指挥权 ，凌驾于你的级别
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

813
01:13:55,058 --> 01:13:58,238
他们会离去，你要让他们走  操！
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck!

814
01:14:44,108 --> 01:14:45,588
回去工作
Back to work.

815
01:14:47,518 --> 01:14:51,158
洛杉矶警局？老天，从他妈哪里冒出来的？
LAPD,  Gee, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

816
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:54,728
也许是他们的一次行动  针对那个区域，不是我们
Maybe it's the score they were onto. The place, not us.

817
01:14:54,818 --> 01:14:56,938
因为那里被劫过几次
Because it's been hit a couple of times, you know something.

818
01:14:56,988 --> 01:14:59,658
假设他们盯上我们的电话，我们的房子
Assume they got our phones, our houses.

819
01:14:59,668 --> 01:15:01,668
假设他们盯着我们，此时此刻
Assume they got us right here, right now...

820
01:15:01,728 --> 01:15:04,208
我们身处的每一件事，假设一切
as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

821
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:06,798
从凯尔索买的银行信息，我们怎么付钱？
How are we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?

822
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:08,398
我先垫付，那不是问题
I'll front that. that's not a problem

823
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:10,238
范·桑特的75万呢？
What if Van Zant has 750?

824
01:15:10,438 --> 01:15:11,408
范·桑特？听着
Van Zant? Listen,

825
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:14,318
我们都火烧眉毛了，你还想和范·桑特来场世界大战？
with the heat we got, you want to play World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

826
01:15:14,378 --> 01:15:16,548
不，我想问他要我的75万
No, I want my 750.

827
01:15:16,608 --> 01:15:20,888
我比你们任何人更想搞范·桑特，他是个大鸡巴富翁
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

828
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:23,618
我们的问题 是劫银行还是现在就跑路
Our problem is to take the bank, or split right now.

829
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:26,218
不回家，不收拾东西，什么也不要
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

830
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:30,758
现在起30秒后 我们各走各路  就这样
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways. That's it.

831
01:15:30,888 --> 01:15:31,958
克里斯
Chris

832
01:15:35,858 --> 01:15:37,838
银行值得冒险
The bank is worth the risk.

833
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:39,578
我需要它，兄弟
I need it, brother.

834
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:44,438
我们应该留下来拿下它  我出来就是为这个
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

835
01:15:55,448 --> 01:15:57,548
我跟你，尼尔  无论如何
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

836
01:15:58,088 --> 01:15:59,848
- 无论如何　　　　　　　
- 不行，这次不行，迈克尔
- Whatever. - No, not on this one, Michael.

837
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,868
这次，你自己做决定
On this one, you're on your own.

838
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:17,248
你认为这是最好的做法吗？
You figure this is the best thing to do?

839
01:16:17,408 --> 01:16:19,468
是最好的做法吗？
This is the best thing to do?

840
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:23,568
我已计划好，完事我就走，这回报是值得的
I've got plans, I'm going away after, so the reward is worth the stretch.

841
01:16:23,608 --> 01:16:26,678
但伊莱恩很照顾你，你有许多积蓄
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

842
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,948
你有国库券，房产
You got T-bonds, real estate.

843
01:16:29,048 --> 01:16:31,888
如果我是你，我就聪明点，不碰这事
If I were you, I would be smart and cut loose of this.

844
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:51,408
对我来说…
For me...

845
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:53,708
行动就是美酒
the action is the juice.

846
01:16:54,338 --> 01:16:55,318
我参加
I'm in.

Let's go.

01:17:04,718 --> 01:17:06,558
去他们的，我们干
Fuck them, let's do it.

851
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:09,028
我们走  我们有许多事要做
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

852
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:23,678

对，你他妈是谁？
Who the fuck are you?

857
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:33,648
我是谁？
Who am I?

LA? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

860
01:17:41,558 --> 01:17:45,128
你知不知道你他妈在推谁？我可认识人
Do you know who the fuck you're pushing around? But I know people here.

861

简单省事

谁需要？你的屁股在回新泽西的飞机上，笨蛋
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jackoff.

875
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:22,628
哦，老兄，我只是...

876
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:25,228
我怎么会跟那婊子混在一起？

877

因为她有个大臀部！

...that's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.

890
01:19:04,468 --> 01:19:05,448
对
Right.

891
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:08,238
这里的安保系统就是个笑话
The security systems around here are a joke.

You got it?

897
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,268

朝这方向

集装箱设施？
A container facility?

901
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:55,688
什么？运输盗窃？

902

太明显了

903
01:19:57,158 --> 01:19:58,698
对他们来说得益太少了

炼油厂和废料场？

910
01:20:22,148 --> 01:20:23,788
是什么鬼玩意儿？

那正是我们正想弄清楚的

想知道他们在看什么吗？
Want to know what they're looking at?

我是指，这家伙可真厉害，真够职业的哈

这伙人很棒
This crew is good.

919
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:02,658
你们想知道他们看什么吗？
You want to know?

920
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:04,788

01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:18,028
整晚搜寻的人，敬业献身
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

952
01:23:20,358 --> 01:23:22,808
有他和这么多的火力，你应该放弃
With him and this much heat, you should pass.

953
01:23:30,108 --> 01:23:31,738
值得一搏
It's worth the stretch.

954
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:34,688
这人可以成功或失手
This guy can hit or miss.

955
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:36,808
你一次也不能失手
You can't miss once.

956
01:23:37,608 --> 01:23:38,778
你肯定吗？
You sure?

957
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:41,258
我肯定
I am sure.

958
01:23:47,058 --> 01:23:48,528
我们去车房吧
Let's go to the garage.

959
01:24:02,178 --> 01:24:03,478
嘉斯汀
Justine.

960
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:09,878
嘉斯汀
Justine.

961
01:24:17,148 --> 01:24:18,628
我们要去哪儿？
Where we going?

962
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,238
好吧，你要去哪里？
Okay, where are you going?

963
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,798
外面
Out.

964
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:26,518
他们在什么频道上？
What are they on?

965
01:25:25,518 --> 01:25:27,788
TAC
Tactical Air Control 战术空军控制

966
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:27,858
第九战术空军控制频道
TAC 9.

967
01:25:29,718 --> 01:25:31,848
他们往北走，出机场的405公路上面
They're northbound out LAx on the 405.

968
01:25:31,888 --> 01:25:34,168
我们有四个地面行动小组
We got four ground units.

969
01:25:52,378 --> 01:25:54,408
我是18号机的文森特·汉纳
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.

970
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:55,358
你是谁？
Who have I got?

971
01:25:55,478 --> 01:25:57,458
我是JJ，我在40号机上
This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.

972
01:25:57,688 --> 01:25:59,178
理查德·格洛弗和我一起
Richard Glover's with me.

973
01:25:59,318 --> 01:26:00,938
车朝105公路东行驶…
It's on the 105 eastbound...

974
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:03,258
接近110交换道
approaching the 110 interchange.

975
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:05,498
你在持续追踪？
You running a revolving tail?

976
01:26:05,788 --> 01:26:08,398
对  我有两个小组在前面，三个在后面
Yes. I got two units in front, three behind.

977
01:26:08,658 --> 01:26:11,938
好，叫其中一个在佛蒙特匝道入口来载我
Okay. Have one of them pick me up at the Vermont on-ramp.

978
01:26:12,898 --> 01:26:14,168
我们走
Let's go.

979
01:27:04,248 --> 01:27:07,888
我离他有一百码远吗？太近还是太远？
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?

980
01:27:08,358 --> 01:27:10,428
300码，中间车道
Three hundred yards, center lane.

981
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,898
你好吗？
How're you doing?

982
01:28:22,558 --> 01:28:25,238
我能请你喝杯咖啡吗？
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

983
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,048
好，当然  我们走
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

984
01:28:33,778 --> 01:28:35,048
跟着我
Follow me.

985
01:28:50,828 --> 01:28:52,698
在福尔松待了七年
Seven years in Folsom.

986
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,268
单独囚禁三年
In the hole for three.

987
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:56,868
之前在麦克尼尔
McNeil before that.

988
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:02,178
麦克尼尔有传说的那样糟吗？
McNeil as tough as they say?

989
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:05,378
你想当监狱管理学者吗？
You looking to become a penologist?

990
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,278
你想再回去吗？
You looking to go back?

991
01:29:08,508 --> 01:29:12,578
你知道，我追捕一些团伙  那些家伙想犯事但被抓回去了
You know, I chased down some crews. Guys just looking to fuck up, get busted back.

992
01:29:12,748 --> 01:29:13,848
是你吗？
That you?

993
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:17,358
你一定是抓了些蠢货团伙
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

994
01:29:18,088 --> 01:29:19,828
各种类型的我都跟
I worked all kinds.

995
01:29:23,218 --> 01:29:27,288
你看见我为寻求刺激抢劫酒铺，胸前还刺着“天生废柴”的纹身吗？
You see me doing thrill-seeking liquor store holdup with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

996
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:29,338
不，我没看见
No, I do not.

997
01:29:29,928 --> 01:29:30,908
对了
Right.

998
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:34,338
我绝不会回监狱去
I am never going back.

999
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:38,138
那就别搞什么行动
Then don't take down scores.

1000
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:41,078
我做我擅长的事
I do what I do best.

1001
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:45,188
我做我的，你做你最擅长的事  去阻止我这样的人
I take scores. You do what you do best. Try to stop guys like me.

1002
01:29:49,048 --> 01:29:51,318
你从没想过要正常的生活？
You never wanted a regular type life?

1003
01:29:52,088 --> 01:29:54,788
那是他妈什么东西？烧烤和球赛吗？
What the fuck is that? The barbecues and the ball games?

1004
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:57,798
是的
Yeah.

1005
01:30:00,258 --> 01:30:02,328
像你这样的正常生活？
This regular type like your life?

1006
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:05,008
我的生活？不，我的生活…
My life? No, my life...

1007
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,468
我的生活是一片重灾区
My life's a disaster zone.

1008
01:30:10,308 --> 01:30:12,838
我有个一团糟的继女
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

1009
01:30:13,368 --> 01:30:16,478
因为她的生父是个大浑蛋
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

1010
01:30:16,538 --> 01:30:17,848
我有个妻子
I got a wife.

1011
01:30:17,908 --> 01:30:21,718
我们互不搭理，在下滑的婚姻之路上越来越远  第三次婚姻了
We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage.My third.

1012
01:30:23,948 --> 01:30:27,728
因为我花光时间在街头追捕你这样的人
Because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

1013
01:30:27,788 --> 01:30:29,128
那就是我的生活
That's my life.

1014
01:30:35,628 --> 01:30:37,398
有人曾对我说…
Guy told me one time

1015
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:43,498
“不要和任何事物有关联，包括那些让你30秒内都不愿离开的
"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat

1016
01:30:43,508 --> 01:30:46,178
就算你感觉到了来自街角的危险  ”
"if you feel the heat around the corner."

1017
01:30:47,438 --> 01:30:50,848
如果你盯着我，我一行动你就得跟着…
Now, if you're on me and you got to move when I move...

1018
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:53,948
你怎能期望维护好婚姻呢？
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

1019
01:30:56,078 --> 01:30:57,928
这个想法很有趣
That's an interesting point.

1020
01:30:59,448 --> 01:31:00,788
你是什么人，修道士？
What are you, a monk?

1021
01:31:02,058 --> 01:31:03,328
我有个女人
I have a woman.

1022
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,338
你怎么跟她说？
What do you tell her?

1023
01:31:07,758 --> 01:31:09,498
我告诉她我是推销员
I tell her I'm a salesman.

1024
01:31:16,268 --> 01:31:19,338
那么，如果你发现我从街角走来…
So, if you spot me coming around that corner...

1025
01:31:20,338 --> 01:31:22,248
你就从这女人身边走开？
you'll just walk out on this woman?

1026
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,418
不说句再见？
Not say good-bye?

1027
01:31:26,178 --> 01:31:27,848
那是纪律
That's the discipline.

1028
01:31:28,678 --> 01:31:30,488
听上去挺虚无缥缈的
That's pretty vacant.

1029
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,318
正是如此
It is what it is.

1030
01:31:32,448 --> 01:31:35,258
就是这样，否则我俩还是干点别的吧，伙计
It's that, or we both better go do something else, pal.

1031
01:31:37,228 --> 01:31:39,198
别的职业我不知道该怎样去做
I don't know how to do anything else.

1032
01:31:39,688 --> 01:31:41,138
我也是
Neither do I.

1033
01:31:43,928 --> 01:31:45,498
也不太想做
I don't much want to either.

1034
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:47,468
我也不想
Neither do I.

1035
01:31:55,178 --> 01:31:57,778
知道吗，我不断做同一个梦
You know, I have this recurring dream.

1036
01:31:59,648 --> 01:32:02,628
我坐在一张很大的宴会餐桌边…
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

1037
01:32:02,678 --> 01:32:06,318
我调查的所有凶案受害人都坐在那里…
...all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting there...

1038
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:09,988
他们用漆黑的眼珠子瞪着我
and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

1039
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:14,908
因为汩汩血液从他们头部伤口流淌出来
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

1040
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:19,228
他们就在那，这些发胀的人…
And there they are, these big balloon people...

1041
01:32:19,928 --> 01:32:23,138
因为我发现他们时，他们已在床下躺了两周
because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

1042
01:32:23,908 --> 01:32:26,378
邻居报称有恶臭…
The neighbors reported the smell...

1043
01:32:27,138 --> 01:32:29,008
他们就在那里…
and there they are...

1044
01:32:29,078 --> 01:32:30,818
全部坐在那里
all just sitting there.

1045
01:32:33,008 --> 01:32:34,218
他们说什么？
What do they say?

1046
01:32:36,248 --> 01:32:37,228
什么也没
Nothing.

1047
01:32:37,688 --> 01:32:38,918
没说话？
No talk?

1048
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:42,858
他们无话可说
They have nothing to say.

1049
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:45,738
我们只是彼此望着对方
We just look at each other.

1050
01:32:46,688 --> 01:32:48,368
他们望着我…
They look at me...

1051
01:32:48,858 --> 01:32:51,028
就这样  就是这个梦
...and that's it. That's the dream.

1052
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:55,778
我梦见自己遇溺
I have one where I'm drowning.

1053
01:32:56,498 --> 01:33:00,178
我得弄醒自己并呼吸，否则会亡于梦中
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing or I'll die in my sleep.

1054
01:33:02,278 --> 01:33:03,648
你知道那是什么意思吗？
You know what's that about?

1055
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:06,718
还有...足够的时间
There...having enough time.

1056
01:33:08,378 --> 01:33:09,618
足够的时间…
Enough time...

1057
01:33:10,018 --> 01:33:11,788
做你想做的事？
...to do what you want to do?

1058
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:13,228
正确
That's right.

1059
01:33:15,718 --> 01:33:17,128
你现在在做？
You doing it now?

1060
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:18,528
没，还没有
No, not yet.

1061
01:33:24,128 --> 01:33:26,108
你知道，我们坐在这里…
You know, we're sitting here...

1062
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:29,708
你和我就像一对正常的伙伴
you and I like a couple of regular fellas.

1063
01:33:29,868 --> 01:33:32,448
你做你的事，我做我得做的
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

1064
01:33:34,738 --> 01:33:37,148
现在我们面对面…
Now that we've been face to face...

1065
01:33:40,078 --> 01:33:42,748
我是个男人的话，就必须撂倒你…
if I'm a man and I gotta put you away...

1066
01:33:43,078 --> 01:33:44,558
我不会喜欢的
I won't like it.

1067
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:46,748
但我告诉你…
But, I tell you...

1068
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:51,138
如果是在你…
if it's between you...

1069
01:33:51,328 --> 01:33:55,168
和某个你要把他妻子变成寡妇的可怜虫之间，选的话…
and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

1070
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:57,338
兄弟…
brother...

1071
01:33:57,768 --> 01:33:59,638
你完蛋了
you are going down.

1072
01:34:12,178 --> 01:34:14,518
这枚硬币还有反面
There's a flip side to that coin.

1073
01:34:16,778 --> 01:34:19,018
若你把我逼入绝境…
What if you do got me boxed in...

1074
01:34:19,418 --> 01:34:21,228
而我必须撂倒你呢？
and I gotta put you down?

1075
01:34:22,358 --> 01:34:24,098
因为无论如何…
Because no matter what...

1076
01:34:24,628 --> 01:34:26,598
你不能阻拦我
you won't get in my way.

1077
01:34:27,858 --> 01:34:30,098
我们曾经面对面，是的
We've been face to face, yeah.

1078
01:34:33,398 --> 01:34:35,138
但我不会迟疑
But I will not hesitate.

1079
01:34:35,468 --> 01:34:36,878
一秒钟也不
Not for a second.

1080
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,748
也许会是这样
Maybe that's will be.

1081
01:34:47,478 --> 01:34:48,548
或者…
Or...

1082
01:34:48,878 --> 01:34:50,218
谁知道呢？
who knows?

1083
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:53,188
也许我们会永远不再见
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1084
01:35:08,998 --> 01:35:10,538
他们甩掉了我们
They dumped us.

1085
01:35:11,808 --> 01:35:12,678
什么？
What?

1086
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:14,778
他们甩掉了我们
They dumped us.

1087
01:35:15,378 --> 01:35:16,648
什么意思？
What do you mean They dumped us ?

1088
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:17,878
克里斯溜走了.
Chris slipped his tail.

1089
01:35:18,008 --> 01:35:20,008
他没谈及他们的行动
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1090
01:35:20,078 --> 01:35:23,488
所以我从马西亚诺那里没问出什么  我试过了
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I just tried.

1091
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,818

Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

1093
01:35:31,228 --> 01:35:33,098
他们甩掉了我们所有的监视？
They dumped all our surveillance?

1094
01:35:33,158 --> 01:35:35,398
是的，同一时间，晚上九点.
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1095
01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:40,068
半小时前我还和麦考利一起喝咖啡！
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

1096
01:35:40,268 --> 01:35:42,738
我们盯着你们，然后麦考利驶向机场
We were on you. Then McCaouley drives to LAX

1097
01:35:42,888 --> 01:35:45,238
监视组不能飞过去，因为航线限制
the surveillance can't fly over, because of the flight path

1098
01:35:45,738 --> 01:35:48,178
他的车还在那里，人不见了
His car's still there. He's gone.

1099
01:35:53,578 --> 01:35:58,218
还有谁知道这些人他妈的在哪儿？
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

1100
01:36:58,048 --> 01:36:59,218
有他的消息吗？
Hear from him?

1101
01:36:59,908 --> 01:37:02,578
什么也没有  没消息更让我不安
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more.

1102
01:37:02,588 --> 01:37:04,188
这人在哪儿？
Where's this guy?

1103
01:37:06,548 --> 01:37:07,458
这里有个人…
This guy here...

1104
01:37:07,518 --> 01:37:08,958
我们雇用他
we put him on.

1105
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:10,788
说他认识麦考利
Says he knows McCauley.

1106
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,438
你是谁？

1109
01:37:22,468 --> 01:37:25,678
我日夜守在这间办公室里  你有多熟识他？
I've been living in this office day and night. How well do you know him?

1110
01:37:27,038 --> 01:37:29,538
我们一起做过些大行动
We took some major scores together.

1111
01:37:33,478 --> 01:37:35,388
为什么他一直没联系我？
Why haven't I heard from him?

1112
01:37:35,718 --> 01:37:37,658
现在他可能正忙着
He's probably busy right now.

1113
01:37:37,988 --> 01:37:39,658
但他行事很彻底
But he's real thorough.

1114
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:43,158
他不会忘记你的
He ain't going to forget about you.

1115
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:44,868
可真让人放心
That's very reassuring.

1116
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:49,158
我有法子可以在这里用上
I got some moves I could make here.

1117
01:37:50,328 --> 01:37:52,568
可能对你会有大用处

1118
01:38:14,018 --> 01:38:15,688
认出那烤肉的人吗？

1119
01:38:23,698 --> 01:38:24,368
没
No.

1120
01:38:24,428 --> 01:38:25,268

1122

拿走！
Pick up!

1128
01:38:44,788 --> 01:38:46,318
他到底在哪儿？
Where the hell is he?

1129
01:38:46,448 --> 01:38:48,428
我想查看一下工作车的位置

我甩不掉他们
I can't dump them.

1137

你才看见他们吗？

不，他们平行跟着我

等你作为从犯入狱，他就会成为孤儿
'Cause he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1360
02:04:29,378 --> 02:04:34,408
你没有父母照顾他，所以他会被送到寄养家庭
'cause you got no parents to take him. So he ends up raised in foster homes.

1361
02:04:34,408 --> 02:04:36,188
青少年中心
juvenile facilities.

1362
02:04:36,408 --> 02:04:38,178
之后他会偷车
Then he steals a car.

1363
02:04:38,878 --> 02:04:43,358
然后他会加入“格斗学院”，就像那些街头混混
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1364
02:04:44,388 --> 02:04:46,188
毁了自己一生
Fucked for life.

1365
02:04:47,858 --> 02:04:50,598
你知道会发生什么，因为你是过来人
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1366
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:56,428
多米尼克还没机会选择他的生活，但克里斯选了
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life. But Chris did.

1367
02:04:58,468 --> 02:05:01,208
如果交出克里斯，你就毫无干系
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1368
02:05:02,168 --> 02:05:03,578
你可以做到的…
You can do it...

1369
02:05:03,898 --> 02:05:06,178
为你的孩子，这样你能抚养他长大
for your kid, so you can raise him.

1370
02:05:10,178 --> 02:05:11,588
你还有什么要说服我的？
What else are you selling?

1371
02:05:11,648 --> 02:05:13,048
各种狗屎烂事
All kinds of shit.

1372
02:05:14,518 --> 02:05:16,818
但我用不着说，你知道的
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.

1373
02:05:16,828 --> 02:05:19,358
这种烂事用不着我来告诉你
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1374
02:05:26,088 --> 02:05:27,428
好了，丹尼，最新消息
Okay, Danni, here's an update.

1375
02:05:27,558 --> 02:05:29,328
杜拉克在二号线上
Drucker's on Line 2.

1376
02:05:29,498 --> 02:05:30,698
警督，等一等
Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1377
02:05:33,698 --> 02:05:35,768
警督，杜拉克警官在另一线上
Lieutenant, I have sergeant Drucker's on the other line.

1378
02:05:36,058 --> 02:05:37,508
会议通话吧
Conference him in.

1379
02:05:38,838 --> 02:05:39,748
说吧
Go ahead.

1380
02:05:40,268 --> 02:05:41,908
文森特，是我
Vincent, it's me.

1381
02:05:44,578 --> 02:05:46,748
一个回答  你决定好了？
One answer. What's it going to be?

1382
02:05:53,818 --> 02:05:56,288
我们准备好了，她会打电话
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1383
02:05:56,358 --> 02:05:59,038
好，很好  情况是这样
Okay, That's good. Here's the deal here.

1384
02:05:59,858 --> 02:06:02,958
休·本尼已改过自新…
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life...

1385
02:06:03,128 --> 02:06:05,628
成为重生的好市民
...and become a born-again good citizen.

1386
02:06:05,898 --> 02:06:09,998
看起来，尼尔被一个叫温格洛的牛仔出卖给我们
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

1387
02:06:10,538 --> 02:06:13,408
温格洛曾是尼尔团伙的一员
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew

1388
02:06:13,558 --> 02:06:16,748
后来替一个洗钱人工作，名叫范·桑特
then went to work for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1389
02:06:17,098 --> 02:06:20,658
我们说话时 有小组在范·桑特家中…
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak...

1390
02:06:20,678 --> 02:06:22,538
因为他今晚较早前被射杀
...because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1391
02:06:22,548 --> 02:06:26,558
现在，如果尼尔要追杀别的人，那就温格洛
If Neil goes after anybody else, it's going to be Waingro.

1392
02:06:26,748 --> 02:06:30,518
温格洛刚拿到侯爵机场酒店的一间套房…
Waingro just got himself a suite at the Airport Marquis...

1393
02:06:30,528 --> 02:06:32,338
化名杰米森
under the name Jamieson.

1394
02:06:32,558 --> 02:06:37,028
他现在在那里  我要你把这消息告诉县里的保释担保人、赌场经纪人、
He's there now. I want you to get that to bail bondsmen, bookies,

1395
02:06:37,038 --> 02:06:40,028
外派警员以及线人
...assignment officers and snitches in County.

1396
02:06:40,498 --> 02:06:42,898
任何你想得到 会把消息传出去的人
Anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street.

1397
02:06:42,908 --> 02:06:44,498
派一组人到酒店
Deploy a team at the hotel...

1398
02:06:44,568 --> 02:06:47,238
并每30分钟亲自检查通讯
and personally check their coms every 30 minutes.

1399
02:06:47,308 --> 02:06:49,618
因为也许尼尔会去找他
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1400
02:06:49,848 --> 02:06:51,588
好吗？你感觉如何？
Okay? How're you feeling?

1401
02:06:52,078 --> 02:06:53,748
吊着膀子，但我会活下来
Hang up, but I'll live.

1402
02:06:53,758 --> 02:06:54,848
好
Okay

1403
02:07:02,818 --> 02:07:04,058
他在这里
He's here.

1404
02:07:04,928 --> 02:07:06,598
尼尔还在这里
Neil is still here.

1405
02:07:07,808 --> 02:07:09,258
我能感觉到
I can feel it.

1406
02:07:10,098 --> 02:07:11,568
会留多久？
For how long?

1407
02:07:13,068 --> 02:07:15,048
七八个小时，最多
Seven, eight hours, max.

1408
02:07:24,408 --> 02:07:25,748
你干了什么？
What did you do?

1409
02:07:26,248 --> 02:07:27,118
那是你干的？
That was you?

1410
02:07:27,678 --> 02:07:29,418
那是我的工作  我不是卖金属的
That's what I do. I don't sell metal.

1411
02:07:30,278 --> 02:07:33,288
本来没事的，之后你飞过去  现在麻烦了
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

1412
02:07:33,448 --> 02:07:34,668
我们要一起走
We gotta go together.

1413
02:07:34,838 --> 02:07:37,588
那些人是和你一起的？
Those other people were with you?

1414
02:07:39,388 --> 02:07:40,998
我的朋友，迈克尔…
My friend, Michael...

1415
02:07:42,698 --> 02:07:44,328
他知道风险，他本不必去的
...he knew the risks, he wouldn't have to be there.

1416
02:07:49,168 --> 02:07:51,238
常在河边走哪能不湿鞋
When it rains, you get wet.

1417
02:07:54,088 --> 02:07:55,278
收拾东西  我们走
Get packed. Let's go.

1418
02:08:02,588 --> 02:08:03,478
伊迪

Eady.

1420
02:08:14,658 --> 02:08:16,368
你为何这样对我？
Why did you do this to me?

1421
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:29,548
不会有事的.
It's gonnabe all right.

1422
02:08:29,708 --> 02:08:31,608
明白吗，不会有事的
You understand? It'll be all right

1423
02:08:36,078 --> 02:08:38,388
不会有事的
It's going to be all right.

1424
02:08:49,828 --> 02:08:52,998
这地址D层18单位有一辆科迈罗
There's a Camaro at this address, Level D, Slot 18.

1425
02:08:58,238 --> 02:08:59,718
这儿有些现金
Here's some cash.

1426
02:09:02,708 --> 02:09:04,018
什么时候结束？
When is it over?

1427
02:09:07,408 --> 02:09:09,118
现在起22小时.
Twenty-two hours from now.

1428

1430
02:09:18,188 --> 02:09:20,188
你想出去？门在那边
You want out? There's the door.

1431
02:09:20,758 --> 02:09:22,758
你稍后会让我离去吗？
Will you let me leave later?

1432
02:09:27,898 --> 02:09:29,468
不会再这样了
It will be different.

1433
02:09:31,108 --> 02:09:32,878
你还不明白吗？
Do you even understand?

1434
02:10:03,798 --> 02:10:05,178
准备好了
It's ready.

1435
02:10:05,278 --> 02:10:07,218
文森特
Vincent.

1436
02:10:12,878 --> 02:10:14,718
这是我的朋友拉尔夫
This is my friend Ralph.

1437
02:10:15,318 --> 02:10:17,318
你没说你已经…
You didn't tell me you were...

1438
02:10:18,148 --> 02:10:19,528
天啊！
Oh, my God!

1439
02:10:19,688 --> 02:10:20,958
萝伦呢？

她在丽萨贝丝家

1442
02:10:25,988 --> 02:10:26,928
你有什么要抱歉？
What are you sorry about?

1443
02:10:26,988 --> 02:10:28,158
坐下
Sit down.

1444
02:10:28,798 --> 02:10:30,208
你都不生气吗？
Don't you even get angry?

1445
02:10:31,398 --> 02:10:32,498
我生气
I'm angry.

1446
02:10:34,228 --> 02:10:36,108
我很生气，拉尔夫
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1447
02:10:36,668 --> 02:10:39,478
你可以干我太太，只要她想让你干
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

你可以在她的沙发上晃悠

在她前夫的…

死板科技后现代主义的鬼房子中
dead-tech, post-modernistic, bullshit house.

1451
02:10:51,318 --> 02:10:52,728
你想的话
if you want to.

1452
02:10:55,088 --> 02:10:57,328
但你不能看…
But you do not get to watch...

1453
02:10:58,028 --> 02:10:59,588
我他妈的
...my fucking...

1454
02:10:59,588 --> 02:11:01,368
电视机！
...television set!

1455
02:11:01,428 --> 02:11:02,798
看在上帝的份上
For God's sake.

1456
02:11:09,638 --> 02:11:11,478
把电视机放下
Put the television set down.

1457
02:11:11,568 --> 02:11:12,528
我从对你不忠，婊子
I never cheated on you, bitch.

1458
02:11:12,568 --> 02:11:13,908
也许你应该
Maybe you should have.

1459
02:11:14,268 --> 02:11:15,728
- 我应该吗？
- 你与此有关
- I should have? - You're a party to this.

1460
02:11:15,768 --> 02:11:19,748
我要拉尔夫干你，因为这使我开心
I made Ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good.

1461
02:11:19,808 --> 02:11:21,478
我们的处境荒谬
Our situation is absurd.

1462
02:11:24,048 --> 02:11:26,088
住口，拉尔夫！坐下！
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1463
02:11:29,758 --> 02:11:33,668
为什么我要理清事情，还要向你解释？
Why is it that I have to figure things out and explain them to you?

1464
02:11:33,828 --> 02:11:36,168
我心口如一，而且言出必行
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1465
02:11:36,698 --> 02:11:37,798
多么可敬
How admirable.

1466
02:11:37,868 --> 02:11:40,168
- 一点没错　　　　　　　　
- 可没有任何事是关于我们的
- You bet. - Except none of it's about us.

1467
02:11:40,798 --> 02:11:41,778
是的
No.

1468
02:11:43,238 --> 02:11:46,078
我可能是抽大麻被定住了或兴奋剂迷糊了，但
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but

1469
02:11:46,738 --> 02:11:49,178
你像个死人走出我们的生活
you've been walking through our life dead.

1470
02:11:49,878 --> 02:11:53,978
现在我还要找拉尔夫来贬低自己，来终断和你的关系
And now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1471
02:12:06,988 --> 02:12:09,398
护照、旅行支票、信用卡
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1472
02:12:09,898 --> 02:12:11,168
这飞机…

1473
02:12:11,568 --> 02:12:14,598
在洛杉矶机场包机站17号机库

呼号是“1011山岭”
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1475
02:12:20,038 --> 02:12:21,238
降落…
Touches down...

1476
02:12:21,308 --> 02:12:23,878
等你五分钟然后便起飞
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1477
02:12:24,108 --> 02:12:27,648
飞机经得起航空局的检查  飞行计划什么的
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.

1478
02:12:29,278 --> 02:12:30,288
克里斯在哪？
Where's Chris?

1479
02:12:30,948 --> 02:12:31,918
他走了
He's gone.

1480
02:12:33,318 --> 02:12:34,298
什么？
What?

1481
02:12:35,118 --> 02:12:37,428
他说要自己走  去找莎琳了
Said he's going on his own. Went to find Charlene.

1482
02:12:37,588 --> 02:12:39,798
- 是你带他来这儿？
- 对，我带他来了　
- Did you bring him here? - Yeah, I brought him here.

1483
02:12:40,808 --> 02:12:41,828
怎么回事？
What happened?

1484
02:12:42,928 --> 02:12:44,498
这是个自由国家，兄弟
It's a free country, man.

1485
02:12:49,738 --> 02:12:51,578
九点联络我…
Check in with me at 9:00...

1486
02:12:51,938 --> 02:12:53,748
一切无恙
everything is still cool.

1487
02:12:55,438 --> 02:12:56,608
好的
All right.

1488
02:13:19,968 --> 02:13:22,308
我甚至不知道自己在做什么
I don't know even what I'm doing anymore.

1489
02:13:25,568 --> 02:13:27,378
我知道生命短促
I know life is short.

1490
02:13:28,008 --> 02:13:30,108
无论多久都是运气
Whatever time you get is luck.

1491
02:13:32,808 --> 02:13:34,378
你想走？
You want to walk?

1492
02:13:37,218 --> 02:13:39,018
你现在就可以走…
You walk right now...

1493
02:13:40,618 --> 02:13:42,218
你想的话

你愿意选择跟我来
On your own you choose to come with me.

1495
02:13:51,968 --> 02:13:53,568
我只知道…
All I know is...

1496
02:13:55,838 --> 02:13:59,108
我到任何地方去都毫无意义
there's no point in me going anywhere anymore

1497
02:14:00,668 --> 02:14:02,678
如果我会独自一人
if it's going to be alone.

1498
02:14:03,708 --> 02:14:05,238
没有你
without you.

1499
02:15:04,358 --> 02:15:06,338
是的文森特，我有个活的

- 快去　
- 住口！

1503
02:15:19,688 --> 02:15:21,928
只需在窗前站一秒
Now, just one second at the window.

1504
02:15:23,158 --> 02:15:24,958
就全都了结了
and it's all over.

1505
02:17:14,938 --> 02:17:16,038
嘿伙计…
Hey, man...

1506
02:17:17,498 --> 02:17:20,978
你知道这附近哪里有出租吗？

1507
02:17:24,128 --> 02:17:26,568
德尔大街边上的阿伯利兹杂货店墙上有告示

截停他  查看一下

1512
02:18:19,508 --> 02:18:21,448
- 警官？
- 是　　
- Sergeant? - Yeah.

1513
02:18:21,968 --> 02:18:23,448

Ran it to DMV.

1516
02:18:29,608 --> 02:18:30,918

02:18:33,878 --> 02:18:34,978
让他走
Let him go.

1518

谢谢，晚安
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1520
02:18:40,888 --> 02:18:41,758
这行不通，文斯
It's no-go, Vinc

1521
02:18:52,128 --> 02:18:54,978
我们等时你想喝咖啡吗？
Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait?

1522
02:18:55,068 --> 02:18:56,808
好，那太好了
Yeah, that would be nice.

1523
02:19:27,928 --> 02:19:29,308

That's it.

1529
02:19:59,998 --> 02:20:01,338

浑蛋们成天冲自己开枪

1546
02:23:24,198 --> 02:23:25,478
不是你，宝贝

她会在哪儿？她叫萝伦

她的血压在下降

我不知道
I don't know.

1564
02:24:26,588 --> 02:24:28,508
你在哪儿找到她？
Where did you find her?

1565
02:24:28,568 --> 02:24:29,738
浴缸
The bathtub.

1566
02:24:30,158 --> 02:24:33,828
给她注射大针管的生理盐水

1567
02:24:34,068 --> 02:24:35,548
紧压出血点

Give me two units, O-negative. Let's type and cross her for six.

1569
02:24:40,948 --> 02:24:44,358

她生命体征稳定
Her vital signs are stable.

外科医生几分钟后出来跟你们谈，到时你们就知道具体情况了
The surgeon will be out to speak to you in a few moments. Then you'll konw what's going on.

1574
02:25:01,468 --> 02:25:02,378
她没事吧？
She's okay?

1575

1578
02:25:08,068 --> 02:25:10,688
我的宝贝  她为何这样对自己？
Oh, my baby. Why did she do this to herself?

1579
02:25:12,108 --> 02:25:15,218
看看她做的  看看她对自己做的
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1580
02:25:19,788 --> 02:25:22,288
没事的  会没事的
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1581
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:24,828
我在这儿，哪里都不去
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1582
02:25:25,088 --> 02:25:27,698
明白吗？我哪儿也不去
Do you understand? I ain't going anywhere.

1583
02:25:42,608 --> 02:25:43,588
是我
It's me.

1584
02:25:44,208 --> 02:25:46,978
飞机已在空中  你正准时
Plane's in the air now. You're right on time.

I still can't find a driver...so that's in the trust.

1586
02:25:51,718 --> 02:25:53,128
还有一事…
One other thing...

1587
02:25:54,118 --> 02:25:55,688
我得告诉你
I gotta tell you.

The guy you want is in the Marquis under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1589
02:26:00,858 --> 02:26:02,668
我想你不会在意了

1590

A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they screwed up his room number. Could you give it to me, please?

I'll check the stairs. If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1614
02:30:45,908 --> 02:30:48,288
她爸爸呢？我该通知他吗？

她选择在你那里自杀

1620
02:31:22,078 --> 02:31:23,748
是否有方法…
Is there any way that...

1621
02:31:26,188 --> 02:31:28,248
可解决我们之间的问题？

1622
02:31:30,758 --> 02:31:33,168
我希望有，你明白的
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1623

就像你说的…

1626
02:31:46,108 --> 02:31:47,478
我只是…
All I am...

02:31:48,168 --> 02:31:50,278
想着追捕罪犯
is what I'm going after.

1628
02:31:57,648 --> 02:31:59,888
我不是你想要的人，嘉丝汀
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1629
02:32:10,958 --> 02:32:12,528
走吧，得不得的话
Go on, if you have to.
