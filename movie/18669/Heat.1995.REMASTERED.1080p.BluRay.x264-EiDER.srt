00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,236
他侧身倒下
To his side.

137
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:32,283
这人看来似乎是胸部中了两枪
This guy here has got what appears to be a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

138
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,244
从头的伤势，烧焦的骨头看来 是近距离被杀
Tattooing around the head wound, scorched bone, close range.

139
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,871
应该是一枪毙命
Probably executed.

140
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,086
160万的债券被盗，他们没拿走现金
And it was a million six in bearer bonds, and they ignored the loose cash.

141
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,963
因为他们没时间，他们有计时
Because they had no time, because they were on a clock.

142
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,925
这代表他们知道警方何时会到达
Which means they knew our response time to a 2-11...

143
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:52,303
听警方广播，把车截停、进入
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

144
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,889
逃走，全在三分钟内搞定
...escaped in under three minutes.

145
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,684
这是好地点，有很好的逃走路线
It's a good spot here. We got good escape routes.

146
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,438
- 在四分之一哩之内有两条公路 - 交通监视器呢？
- Two freeways within a quarter of a mile. - Traffic video camera?

147
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,607
可能被破坏了，但还是查一下
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

148
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,275
你认出手法了吗？
You recognize the M.O.?

149
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,195
手法就是他们很厉害
M.O. is that they're good.

150
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,198
当他们杀了两个警卫
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all of them...

151
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,451
犯了一级谋杀罪后，便不再迟疑
...after they killed the first two guards, they didn't hesitate...

152
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,497
杀了第三名，因为··· 反正没有差别
...popped guard number three because what difference does it make?

153
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,416
为何留活口？
Why leave a living witness?

154
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,877
在危机时刻，这些人亳不迟疑
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock 'n' roll.

155
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,298
锥孔装药
The shape charge.

156
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:33,219
显示劫匪的技术是纯熟的
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.

157
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,304
纯熟到他们能在运送途中出手
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

158
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,100
从最近几宗大窃盗悬案开始查起
So let's start looking for recent high-line burglaries that have mystified us.

159
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,436
查联邦调查局档案有“滑头”这绰号的
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

160
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,771
名单可能很长，但还是要查
You're gonna get the phone book. Do it anyway.

161
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,941
谁负责脱手债券？
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

162
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:50,653
查惯常收赃者 你和我查库苏马诺和陶瑞纳
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.

163
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,532
我要你查高斯汀及阿法洛 和监识科紧密合作
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro. Hang in with Forensics.

164
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,493
向炸弹组查问用的是什么炸药
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

165
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,580
要是幸运是罕见的，可追查发售来源
If we're lucky, it's exotic. We can trace the sale.

166
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,417
你别乱摸那男人的口袋，瑞秋
Get your hand out of that man's pocket, Rachel.

167
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,668
喔，文森
Oh, Vince.

168
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,969
有谁要吃派吗？
Want some pie?

169
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,272
我去上厕所
Gotta go to the john.

170
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:00,723
他作势攻击，我得先下手为强
Look, I had to get it on, man. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

171
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,907
他那份在车上，由我们先均分
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

172
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,910
把他的那份都给他
...to make up for his full end.

173
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,580
因为我想立即分赃并打发这杂种
Because I wanna pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

174
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,748
好
Okay.

175
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,038
等等！
Hold it!

176
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,760
嘿
Hey.

177
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,848
- 其余的钱呢？ - 我们迟到了
- Where's the rest? - We're late.

178
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,061
你打扮得这么漂亮 我想在这里和你做爱
Ooh, you look too good to go out. I could just jump you right here.

179
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,733
- 钱呢？ - 给组头了
- Where is it? - Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

180
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,320
几天后还会有钱，放心吧 我们真的迟到了
There's more in a couple days, so don't sweat it. We really are late.

181
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,615
得了吧，你肯定是说笑
Yeah, come on, you gotta be kidding me.

182
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,120
亲爱的，为区区八千元
Honey, it ain't worth the risks you take for 8000.

183
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,123
值得冒这个险吗？
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

184
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,625
走吧，拿你的外套
Let's go. Get your coat.

185
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,047
跟你说没用，你心智尚未成熟
There is no point talking to you. All you are is a child growing older.

186
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,549
什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

187
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,886
意思是我们不像其他成年人那样在进步 过该过的生活
It means we're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

188
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,305
因为我嫁给了一个不听我说话的赌徒
I'm married to a gambling junkie who won't listen.

189
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,141
夏琳，快上车吧
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

190
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,228
我怎么能够这样下去？
What am I doing in this rat-bastard situation?

191
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,732
你可以不用！你要我怎样？ 你离开这里时，把银行存摺和车钥匙
You're not! What do you want from me? Leave the bankbook and car keys...

192
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,110
留在厨房，我们到底要不要去 还是我一个人去？
...in the kitchen on your way out. Are we going, or am I going alone?

193
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,779
那些垃圾你可以留着 我会带多明尼克走
You could keep that other crap but Dominick would go with me.

194
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,491
你休想···
Don't you even think about...

195
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,602
告诉我亚伯特陶瑞纳回电话了
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

196
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,981
- 亚伯特陶瑞纳有打给文森吗？ - 没有
- Albert Torena call Vincent? - No.

197
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,484
没有，报告出来了
No. Report came in.

198
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,820
炸药是戴尼克斯 在拆屋时用的线性聚能炸药
The explosive was Dynex, linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

199
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:28,991
只要驾照，就可在内华达 亚利桑那、新墨西哥州买到
You can pick it up with a driver's license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

200
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,496
- 太普通，难以追查来源，文森 - 太好了
- Too common to trace a sale, Vincent. - Oh, that's wonderful.

201
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,642
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

202
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,353
怎么了？你去了哪里？
What happened? Where you been?

萝伦的父亲有来吗？
Lauren's dad show up?

205
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,905
没打电话，没出现，我们等你到十点半
Didn't call, didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

206
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:13,244
这人知道他女儿过得怎样吗？
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with his kid?

207
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,831
我不知道
I don't know.

208
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,874
该死的混蛋
Fucking jerk.

209
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,877
那她没事吧？
Well, is she okay?

210
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,880
她整天在房间里
She's been in her room all day.

211
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,217
所以她有事，我也不开心
So no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

212
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:33,639
我为我们做了晚餐，四个小时前
Uh, I made dinner for us, four hours ago. Um...

213
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:38,853
每次我设法替我们保持一贯的情绪 你就会退却
Every time I try to maintain a consistent mood between us, you withdraw.

214
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:45,568
在威尼斯大道旁边躺着三名死人 贾丝汀
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

I'm sorry...

216
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,740

00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,687
你的家人最早从哪里来的？
So where's your family from originally?

267
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,147
嗯···
Um...

268
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,900
他们是苏格兰及爱尔兰裔
I'm Scotch-Irish.

269
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,532
1700年末期移居到美国阿帕拉契
They, um, emigrated to Appalachia in the late 1700s.

270
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,159
你从哪里来的？
Where are you from?

271
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,495
旧金山湾区
The Bay Area.

272
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,289
家人在那里？
Are your folks there?

273
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:16,004
母亲很久前死了，我父亲··· 我不知道他在哪里
Uh, my mother died a long time ago, and my father, I don't know where he is.

274
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,714
我有个兄弟在某处
Got a brother somewhere.

275
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,014
我猜你跟家人的关系很紧密吧？
You have a tight family. I can tell.

276
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,016
- 是 - 我就知道
- Yep. - Right?

277
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,018
你说对了
You're right.

278
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,735
是啊···
Yeah...

279
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,488
灯火通明的城市
City of lights.

280
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:50,456
在斐济，有一种会发光的海藻 每年浮出水面一次
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae. They come out once a year in the water.

281
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,417
就像这样
That's what it looks like out there.

282
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,420
你去过斐济？
You been there?

283
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,881
没有，但我终有一天会去
No, I'm going there someday.

284
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,341
是吗？
Oh, yeah?

285
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,183
你常旅游？
You travel a lot?

286
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,314
- 是的 - 旅游使你寂寞？
- Yeah. - Traveling makes you lonely?

287
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,615
我一个人，可是我并不寂寞
I... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

288
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,492
你呢？
You?

289
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,411
很寂寞
I get lonely.

290
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,579
亚伯特！
Albert!

291
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,541
- 该死 - 亚伯特
- Shit. - Albert.

292
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,668
文森，你为何来这里？
Vincent, what you doing coming here, man?

293
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,211
你疯了吗？这里不是迪士尼乐园
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

294
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:48,008
你昨晚该回我电话的，亚伯特 你去了哪里？
You were supposed to get back to me last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

295
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:52,262
- 我无法脱身，文森 - 我们侵犯他的民权吧
- I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know. - Let's violate his ass right now.

296
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,558
我帮忙你，你却不帮我，是这样吗？
I do for you, you don't do for me, is that it?

297
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,561
文森，我发誓我整晚在外面
Vincent, man, I swear, I was out all night, man.

298
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,064
为你刺探消息
I'm hitting like one of them flamingo-matador guys.

299
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,358
那和我有什么关系
Flamingo? That's got nothing to do with me.

300
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,944
我不留痕迹，努力为你找线索
I was cutting it real smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you.

301
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,489
- 你也知道我很圆滑 - 你胡说
- I'm a dancer, man. You know. - Bullshit.

302
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:13,075
我传呼你一整天，我讨厌这样做
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand paging.

303
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,827
你这毒虫？又吸食安非他命了？
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

304
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,914
我有滥用药物的问题，有点同情心吧
Where is your empathy, brother? It's a substance-abuse problem.

305
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,374
同情心是昨天
Empathy was yesterday.

306
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,501
今天你在浪费我的时间
Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

307
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,836
- 文森，听着 - 你坠入爱河了吗？
- Vincent, man, look... - Did you fall in love?

308
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,423
告诉我，你昨晚是不是坠入爱河 所以去了别处？
Come on. Did you fall in love last night and you went off somewhere?

309
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,926
- 文森 - 只要告诉我，我会接受这解释
- Vincent... - Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.

310
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,762
- 我会相信 - 文森
- I'll buy that. - Vincent.

311
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,055
告诉我你所知道的
Give me all you got!

312
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,224
- 文森 - 告诉我你所知道的！
- Vincent... - Give me all you got!

313
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,228
我发誓，我兄弟李察会跟你说
I swear, man, my brother, man. My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

314
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,105
我听到他说“李察”？
I heard "Richard"?

315
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,399
- 他会告诉你 - 李察？
- He's gonna talk to you. - Richard?

316
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,900
- 李察 - 李察
- Richard. - Richard.

317
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:50,112
- 他今晚会见你，我发誓 - 他现在不在这里？
- He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight. - He's not here, is he?

318
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,615
- 不在，他今晚会见你 - 今晚？现在不行吗？
- No, he's gonna meet you tonight. - Tonight? What happened to now?

319
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,577
我恳求他，因为我知道你今早会到来
I... I... I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

320
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,871
- 胡说 - 不，我发誓
- This is a bunch of bullshit. - No, no, I swear.

321
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,749
他说早上不行， 因为他在凤凰城
He said no because he in Phoenix.

322
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,770
- 啊 - 我发誓，今晚是我仅能做到的
- Ahh. - But this, man, I swear... I swear, man.

323
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,378
我到了凤凰城后
By the time I get to Phoenix,

324
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,131
他会起程
He'll be risin',

325
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:13,385
可能留下字条，贴在门上
He'll probably leave a note right on the door.

326
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,762
我尽力了，今晚
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

327
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:22,060
他会和你在阿瓦拉多街的 B J 餐厅见面
You know? He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

328
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,563
凌晨二点，去那里
...at 2 a.m. Be there.

329
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,148
你也要到
You be there too.

330
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,192
文森，我不行，我有事要办，文森
Vincent, I can't be there, man. I got things to do, Vincent.

331
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,821
- 我有事办，要到别处去 - 听好
- I got things to do, places to be. I got... - Hey, hey, hey.

332
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,157
你要去
Be there.

333
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,874
不要浪费我的时间！
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

334
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,879
是什么买卖？
What is it?

335
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,673
是银行
It's a bank.

336
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:55,135
他们星期四会存钱，以便分发给各分行
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

337
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,345
让他们星期五可以支付薪水的支票
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

338
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,682
所以星期四，总行总是放满现钞
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

339
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,518
- 在途中下手还是抢劫银行？ - 银行，由正门进入
- On the prowl or strong? - Strong. Through the front door.

340
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,520
有多少人？
How many guys?

341
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,690
连司机四人，走进银行，得手便走
Four, or three plus a driver. Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

342
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,233
你要先拿十万
And you want a 100,000 advance...

343
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,694
事成后分一成？
...against a 10-percent cut for that?

344
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,156
听起来像西部牛仔抢劫银行 他们按警铃后
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score. They hit the holdup alarms...

345
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,034
我得在警察来临之前离去，这算什么？
...I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?

346
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,578
他们会按三个警铃
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

347
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:23,872
两个透过电话，一个是无线
Two telco and a cellular.

348
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,668
但讯号无法传送出去，因为
See, but the signals aren't going anywhere because...

349
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:34,674
你潜进银行，破坏警报系统的电脑
See, the night before, you cut in and trick out the alarm-system computer...

350
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:40,430
使电脑及录影装置 在你下手的前20分钟关掉
...to turn itself and the video recorders off 20 minutes before you walk in the door.

351
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,141
你有建筑及电子蓝图？
Architectural, electrical-engineering plans?

352
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:47,562
我都有，图表、电脑板已经建造好 直接连接到中央处理器
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards already built. They go straight into the CPU.

353
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,565
估计会有多少钱？
What's the estimate?

354
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:56,530
1210万到1220万
12.1, 12.2 million.

355
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,534
我参加
You're on.

356
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,744
恭喜
Congratulations.

357
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:06,873
让我告诉你，我如何估计钱的总数 这是我印出来的
And to give you a little idea of where my estimates come from, this is a printout...

358
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,459
没人知道货是你的
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

359
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:13,129
就算如此，照我说的话 保险会全数赔偿
Be that as it may, my way you get 100 percent from the insurance company...

360
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,966
以六成价向我们把债券买回
...and take the bonds from us at 60 cents on the dollar...

361
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,218
你可以多赚四成
...and make yourself another 40 percent.

362
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,764
你完全没有损失，我们大家都受益
Your operation doesn't skip a beat. Everybody makes out.

363
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:25,433
好，成交
Sure, you got a deal.

364
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:29,312
很好，因为如果有一方不高兴 那就无利润可言
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

365
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,108
让你的人给我打电话，安排会面
Yeah, so you have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

366
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,651
好，很好
Yeah, okay.

367
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,486
很高兴和你通电话
Nice talking to you.

368
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,114
你要和他们交易？
You gonna deal with these guys?

369
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:42,284
现在江湖上认为我的东西可以偷
So word's out on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

370
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,120
我会杀了这帮浑蛋
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

371
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,582
叫哈利给我加纳利群岛的电子试算表
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Islands' offshore.

372
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:56,047
就像我说的，这些不是估计 是实在数宇
That's not really an estimate. Those are exact figures.

373
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,509
我印出银行过去两个月的现金账
I have a printout of the, uh, cash flow of the bank for the past two months.

374
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,304
- 资料怎么得来的？ - 送上门的
- How'd you get this information? - Just comes to you.

375
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,306
资料俯拾皆是
This stuff just flies through the air.

376
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,475
他们到处传送资料
They send information out and it's beamed out all over the place.

377
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,979
只需加以掌握便行，我懂得如何掌握
All you have to do is know how to grab it. See, I know how to grab it.

378
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,947
这是我们要的，1390万
Um... Okay, here we go. Thirteen-point-nine million.

379
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,577
- 我接了 - 很好
- I bought it. - Good.

380
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,537
我没说错吧？
What did I tell you?

381
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,417
拿着
Here.

382
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,838
他同意了，联络凡赞，向他收钱吧
We're on. Call Van Zant, collect the money.

383
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,926
- 他怎样？ - 他是生意人
- How is he? - He's a businessman.

384
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,887

386
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,420
- 喂？ - 是，喂

387
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:19,881
克里斯在我家
Chris is at my place.

388
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:26,680
- 怎么了？ - 夫妻争吵
- What's wrong? - Husband-and-wife stuff.

389
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,724
我让他睡醒再说
I'll let him sleep it off here.

390
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,281
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

391
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:53,081
- 你何时买家具？ - 我有空的时候
- When you gonna get some furniture? - When I get around to it.

392
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,794

Charlene's gonna leave me.

393
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,339
为什么？
Why?

394
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,094
我无法好好养她
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

395
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,347
我们做这么多买卖还不够？

396
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,351
赌场及超级杯使我身无分文

“你想在江湖混吗？
You wanna be making moves on the street?

406
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,133
要无牵挂，生活中不能有牵绊
Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life...

407
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,719
可以随时一走了之

一旦感到风头不对时”

For me, the sun rises and sets with her.

...I want pictures of who he moves and sits with.

524
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,858
调查他们，如果有案底便跟踪他们 看他们跟谁混
Then run makes on them. They got jackets, I wanna see who they move and sit with.

525
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:06,527
我要明晚前开始执行
I want it up and running by tomorrow night.

526
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,085
- 把手放在我看得到的地方 - 什么？
- Put your hands where I can see them. - What?

527
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:07,254
- 把手放在我看得到的地方 - 好
- Put your hands where I can see them. - All right.

528
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:11,050
我会告诉你做什么以及怎样去做
I tell you what to do, I tell you how to do it.

529
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:15,763
现在，只用你的右手，只准右手
Now, with your right hand only, your right hand only...

530
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:19,433
把包裹拿出来，仍过来
...take the package and throw it in here.

531
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,953
该死，你右边后面有人
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.

532
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,618
罗杰凡赞吗？
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?

533
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:03,746
- 是，你是谁？ - 你知道我是谁
- Yeah, who's this? - You know who this is.

534
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,290
是，我知道
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

535
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:11,045
我派人送包裹，他没来电话 一切都好吧？
I sent a guy to deliver the package. He didn't call. Is everything right?

536
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:14,340
我告诉你，忘了那笔钱
Tell you what, forget the money.

537
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:18,385
- 什么？ - 忘了那笔钱
- What? - Forget the money.

538
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,262
呃···
Wh...

539
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,517
你说什么，数目不少，什么意思？ 你在做什么？
It's a lot of money. What are you doing? What do you mean, forget the money?

540
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:27,561
我在做什么 ？我在对话筒喃喃自语
What am I doing? I'm talking to an empty telephone...

541
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:29,396
我不明白
I don't understand.

542
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:33,234
因为跟我讲电话的另一端，是个死人
...because there is a dead man on the other end of this fucking line.

543
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,755
我的天
Oh, my.

544
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,258
- 你喜欢吗？ - 看我的戒指
- Do you like it? - Look at my ring.

545
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,844
哇喔
Wow.

546
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:05,766
你之前就知道的？好美
Did you know about this? It's so beautiful.

547
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,601
你真疯狂
You are insane.

548
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:13,732
喜欢吗？
Do you like it?

549
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,776
- 好美 - 是，很棒
- It's beautiful. - Yeah, it's pretty good.

550
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:19,280
- 别问他从哪里得来的 - 没错
- Just don't ask him where he got it. - Yeah, that's right.

551
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,998
你长大后想做什么，亲爱的？
What do you wanna be when you grow up, honey?

552
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,375
我不知道
I don't know.

553
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,547
她不知道，跟我一样，我也不知道
She doesn't know. Just like me. I don't know either.

554
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:52,479
喂？
Hello?

555
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,565
是我
Hi, it's me.

556
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:58,485
我在想你是否会来电话
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

557
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:02,573
我最近很忙，我可以见你吗？
I've been busy. Can I see you?

558
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:07,745
我害怕那只是一夜情
I was afraid that was just the one night, you know?

559
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,831
不，对我来说不是
No, not for me, it wasn't.

560
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,919
我也不是
Yeah, me neither.

561
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,339
我可以来吗？
Can I fall by?

562
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:22,676
- 可以 - 好，一会儿见
- Yeah. - Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

563
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:34,855
谢谢
Thank you.

564
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,358
晚安
Good night.

565
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,902
该死的聚餐
Goddamn convention.

566
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,155
- 哪一个是滑头？ - 魁梧的那个
- Which one's Slick? - The wide one.

567
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:44,531
有两个监听器
Got two transmitters.

568
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,743
一个在轮舱里，备用的在防火墙里
One's in the wheel well, backup's in the firewall.

569
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:49,370
是我们的车
Okay, get ready.

570
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,747
- 跟尼尔说晚安了吗？ - 晚安
- Did you say good night to Neil? - Good night.

571
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:55,542
金发的是克里斯薛哈利斯 特别调查组正派人轮流跟踪
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis. SIS has got a revolving tail...

572
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,503
和监听他家的电话
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

573
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:03,050
切利托开过贵重金属库三次
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals depository three times.

574
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:06,095
里面有白金、银和一些金条
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

575
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:09,223
山米和我认为那是他们下一个目标
Sammy and I think that's gonna be their next score.

576
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,392
那独行侠是谁？
Who's the loner?

577
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,398
我们第一次见他，还没开始跟踪他
First time we're seeing him. We're not on him yet.

578
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,068
那赶快开始吧
Well, get on it.

579
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,328
好
Okay.

580
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:44,550
他们下次不管做什么案得手 走出大门时
When these guys walk out the door of whatever score they're gonna take next...

581
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:48,595
铁定会大吃一惊
...they're gonna have the surprise of a lifetime.

582
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:06,363
宝贝，我得走了
Hey, baby. Time to go.

583
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,533
我让你很开心吧？
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

584
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,744
是的
Oh, yeah.

585
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:16,206
你很棒，很不错
You fly. You cool.

586
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:27,551
你骗我，我看得出别人骗我
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.

587
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:31,722
我没说谎，你狠勇猛
Mm, I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

588
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,475
是个出色的骑士
A regular rodeo rider.

589
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:38,020
是我年轻的生命中，有过最精采的性交
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.

590
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,735
我现在得回到街上去
Now I got to get my ass street side, sugar.

591
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:47,196
你没有说实话的作风
You don't have a truth-telling style.

592
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:51,909
- 你在说什么？ - 你不知道是怎么回事
- What are you talking about? - You don't know what this is.

593
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,876
死神来探望你了
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

594
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,979
你去了哪里？
Where you been?

595
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,191
鹈鹕海湾监狱
SHU at Pelican Bay.

596
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,735
褔松监狱，B座
New Folsom, B-wing.

597
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:31,115
我是牛仔，吃得了苦
I am a cowboy looking for anything heavy.

598
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,992
比利雷克茨说来找你
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

599
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,537
因此我到这里来
That is why I am here.

600
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,795
你···
Why don't you...?

601
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:48,507
你何不给这人打通电话？
Why don't you call this guy?

602
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:51,343
他经常在征人
This guy's always putting guys on.

603
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,223
谢了，兄弟
Thank you, brother.

604
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,977
- 我能请你喝一杯吗？ - 请我喝一杯
- I'll buy you a drink? - Buy me a drink.

605
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,234
- 有什么好笑的？ - 没什么
- What's so funny? - Nothing.

606
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:10,612
- 很白痴 - 好像有人疏忽了
- It's really dumb. - Something smells negligent.

607
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,699
你们俩天生一对，是怎么认识的？
You two are perfect for each other. How did you meet?

608
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:20,539
我念小学时认识一个人
I knew this guy in, uh, grade school.

609
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,875
他叫拉乌，还是什么的
He was named Raoul, uh... Whatever.

610
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,712
他可以把手指一个一个向上叠
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers and fold them over, one over the other.

611
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,839
然后他会把眼睑向外翻
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out...

612
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:33,010
我忍不住对你上下其手，是真的
I can't keep my hands off you, and that's the truth.

613
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:38,515
你吸引人的地方就在于你的兽性
That's what's so wonderful about you, in that bestial sort of way.

614
00:58:42,604 --> 00:58:44,229
女人
Woman.

615
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,613
这最好是山崩地裂的大事
This better be earth-shattering.

616
00:58:52,823 --> 00:58:54,658
（一个傅呼 紧急事，105 - 3685）

617
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,662
这是她说的，为拉乌干杯
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

618
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,873
- 为拉乌干杯 - 为拉乌干杯
- Raoul. - To Raoul.

619
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,209
我是文森汉纳
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

620
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:28,567
（提供周租）

621
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:49,378
发现她时是这样
Here's how we found her.

622
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:55,676
- 她几岁？ - 十六、七岁
- How old? - Sixteen, seventeen.

623
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,886
在这里约六小时
Been here about six hours.

624
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,513
她怎么死的，瑞秋？
How'd she die, Rachel?

625
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:03,100
头部被重击，大脑血肿，像其他人一样
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.

626
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,062
那是谁？
Who's that?

627
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:10,315
- 我想是死者母亲及家人 - 他们为何到这来？
- Mother and siblings, I guess. - What the hell they doing here?

628
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:14,194
因为消息走漏，有人认识死者 通知家人
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

629
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,530
好，打开吧
Okay, let's go.

630
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,411
真好
That's nice.

631
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,748
直觉告诉我，化验精液后，会是同一人
When I run a DNA check on the semen, my intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

632
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,127
所以是连环谋杀案，要由你着手调查
So it's a series, and ending up in your court.

633
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:33,422
- 凶案组警长有头绪吗？ - 还没有
- Sheriff's Homicide getting anywhere? - Not yet.

634
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:36,425
- 抓住她 - 放开我，放开我
- Get her. - Get off me. Get off me.

635
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,093
噢
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

636
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:40,762
- 我的天 - 等等
- Oh, my God. - Hold it, hold it.

637
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:48,312
- 她在哪里？ - 冷静
- Where is she? - Easy, easy, easy.

638
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:52,774
拜托，别这样
Please. Please, come on.

639
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:58,488
- 没事的 - 是谁干的？
- It's okay. It's okay. - Who did this?

640
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:01,700
我的女儿呢？她在哪里？
Where's my baby? Where is she?

641
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:05,245
我要知道是怎么回事
I need to know what happened.

642
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,247
我猜山崩地裂的事的确发生了
I guess the Earth shattered.

643
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:53,251
你为何不让博斯高先送你回家？
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

644
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:58,131
我不想扫他们的兴 发生了什么事？
I didn't wanna ruin their night too. What was it?

645
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,676
你不会想知道的
You don't wanna know.

646
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:04,179
我想知道你为何扳起脸孔
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look.

647
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:07,808
我不能透露，你是知道的，我们走吧
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go. Come on.

648
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,686
你从没告诉我，我会被摒除事外
You never told me I'd be excluded.

649
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:17,150
我们刚在一起时，我告诉过你 你要和我分享
I told you when we hooked up, baby, that you were gonna have to share me...

650
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:21,071
世上所有的丑行及丑恶的人
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

651
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,659
我同意分享，因为我爱你
And I bought into that sharing because I love you.

652
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:31,748
你发胖、秃头、有没有钱、开公车 我都不在乎，我仍爱你
I love you fat, bald, money, no money, driving a bus. I don't care.

653
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,127
但你得像一般人一样，偶尔跟我交心
But you have got to be present like a normal guy some of the time.

654
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,838
那才叫分享，这不是分享 我得到的是残缺不全的东西
That's sharing. This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

655
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,007
我懂了，所以我回家后，应该告诉你
Oh, I see. What I should do is come home and say:

656
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:45,053
亲爱的，你知道吗？我今天看到一个
Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

657
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:48,974
吸毒男子用微波炉，把他的小孩煮熟
...where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

658
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,769
因为他哭得太大声，让我和你分享吧
...because it was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

659
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,772
让我们分享此事，而在分享时
Come on, let's share that, and in sharing it...

660
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:01,945
我们可以宣泄一切不好的事，对吗？
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit, right?

661
01:03:04,574 --> 01:03:06,950
错，你知道为什么吗？
Wrong. You know why?

662
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:09,286
因为你喜欢正常的作法
Because you prefer the normal routine.

663
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,663
我们做爱，然后你不出一语
We fuck, then you lose the power of speech.

664
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,374
因为我得保持我的痛楚
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

665
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:18,336
我保存它，因为我需要藉此提高警觉
I preserve it, because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

666
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,923
我必须这么做
Where I gotta be.

667
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,765
你不是和我同住
You don't live with me.

668
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:36,188
你和死者的残骸同住
You live among the remains of dead people.

669
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:40,817
在地面上找线索
You read the terrain.

670
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:45,322
你寻找死亡的迹象
You search for signs of passing...

671
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,532
找猎物的气味
...for the scent of your prey...

672
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,493
然后追捕他们
...and then you hunt them down.

673
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,706
这是你唯一投入的事
That's the only thing you're committed to.

674
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,795
其余的是你经过时留下的烂摊子
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

675
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:09,387
我不明白的是，我为何不能离开你
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

676
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,155
嘿，莉莉安小姐，你好
Hey. Miss Lillian.

677
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,909
我们走吧，宝贝
Let's go, baby.

678
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:37,207
我见过经理，还是他是老板？
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

679
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,544
我为他现在每天在做的事而坐牢
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

680
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:45,131
你可以忍受直至找到新工作吗？
Baby, can you just handle it till we find you something new?

681
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,467
你可以吗？
Can you do that?

682
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:52,514
更难忍受的我也捱过
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

683
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,814
你为何和我一起，莉莉安？
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

684
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,317
因为我以你为荣
Because I'm proud of you.

685
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,951
你以我为荣？
You're proud of me?

686
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,957
你为什么会以我为荣？
What the hell you proud of me for?

687
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,918
回家吧
Come on home.

688
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:35,682
- 你去那里做什么？ - 我去滑雪
- What were you doing there? - I was skiing.

689
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,059
我试图滑雪
I was trying to ski.

690
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,605
那就是大家去那里的原 因，滑雪
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

691
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,107
顺便认识别人
...and you meet people.

692
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:45,775
有个愉快的时光
You try to have a good time.

693
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,611
- 你有愉快的时光吗？ - 没有
- Did you have a good time? - No.

694
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:48,903
为什么？
Why not?

695
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:51,406
我不擅交际
I'm not good at meeting people.

696
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:53,491
你认识了我
You met me.

697
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,578
我没细想，事情便发生了
Well, that happened without my thinking about it.

698
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,247
可能就是因为这个缘故
Which is why, probably.

699
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:01,958
不，那是因为你很有魅力
No, it's because you were fine.

700
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,545
伊迪
Eady.

701
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:09,257
跟我一起去玩
Take off with me for a while.

702
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,510
- 哪里？ - 纽西兰
- Where? - New Zealand.

703
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:15,930
什么时候？
When?

704
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,476
我不能和你同去 但我可以和你在那会合
I have to go separate, but you could meet me there.

705
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:21,645
但我的工作，我的···
But my job, my...

706
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:26,650
我有钱，你不需要赚钱 你可以在那里开个设计公司，在那工作
I got money. You don't need money. You could set up a studio, do work there.

707
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,653
- 我不知道 - 还要知道什么？
- I don't know. - What's there to know?

708
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,780
你是不是已经结婚了？
Are you married?

709
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,449
- 什么？ - 你来去无踪
- What? - You come and go...

710
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:36,242
我才没有结婚
The last thing I am is married.

711
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,454
我的人生正在走下坡，大空白
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way, a double blank.

712
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,456
可是，突然
Then, all of a sudden...

713
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,668
出现了你这样的人
...someone like you comes along.

714
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,840
- 你还不够了解我，尼尔 - 我了解得够多了
- You don't know me, Neil. - I know enough.

715
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,388
跟我走
Come with me.

716
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,816
怎么了，亲爱的？
What's wrong, baby?

717
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:12,278
没什么，一切都好，你会去吗？
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

718
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,368
会
Yeah.

719
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:23,248
很好
Good.

720
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,816
- 亲爱的 - 你好
- Hey, sweetie. - Hi.

721
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:53,194
怎么了？你忘了妈妈会去接你吗？
What happened? You forget your mom was picking you up?

722
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:56,156
不是
No.

723
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,534
那是怎么回事？
So, what's going on?

724
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:03,246
我想独自一人待着
I felt like being alone.

725
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,876
好吧，我送你回家
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

726
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:16,384
- 嘿，麦克 - 嘿，萝伦
- Hey, Mike. - Hey, Lauren.

727
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:05,600
有何动静？
What's happening?

728
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:08,603
小队长
Lieutenant. Sir.

729
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:11,397
杰克森警长想知道有何动静
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

730
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:14,567
没有动静，不要用无线电
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

731
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,960
杰克森是个···
Jackson's a...

732
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:43,097
（投资级金属）

733
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,456
好技术
Technique.

734
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,895
芝麻开门，就在那里
Open sesame. Right there.

735
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:31,162
他行动了
There he goes.

736
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,976
- 我们离开 - 我快完成了
- We walk. - I'm right there.

737
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:37,145
我们离开，现在马上走
We walk! Now! Come on.

738
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,575
他听到了
He's heard it.

739
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,994
他听到了
He's heard it.

740
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,087
注意
Heads up.

741
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:05,882
- 一个人出来了 - 等等，警长
- One's coming out. - Hold it, captain.

742
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,677
- 文森，他没带走任何东西 - 是，我看到了
- Vincent, he's not carrying anything. - Yeah, I see.

743
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,058
- 行动 - 要等我上司批准
- Here we go. - Not till my boss says so.

744
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,727
文森，他们俩都没拿东西
Vincent, both of them are not carrying anything.

745
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,571
- 好，让他们走 - 什么意思？
- Okay, let them go. - What do you mean?

746
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:29,781
我们可以逮捕他们
We can take them...

747
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,033
控以何罪？非法入侵？
What are you gonna take them on? Breaking and entry?

748
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:34,285
你不懂吗？他们还没偷东西
They didn't steal anything. Don't you get it?

749
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:36,704
是轻罪
It gets knocked back to some misdemeanor...

750
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:39,373
他们坐牢半年便可出狱，不行
...they do six months and they're out. No fucking way.

751
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,668
我会挨上级骂，他们不能走
I'm not taking the heat from my boss. They're not walking.

752
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:46,506
他们会走，今次行动由我指挥
That's exactly what they're gonna do. They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

753
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:49,050
我的战略指挥凌驾你的职位
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

754
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:53,346
他们会离去，你会让他们走，可恶
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck.

755
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:40,476
回去工作
Back to work.

756
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:45,606
洛杉矶警察？他们从哪里冒出来的？
L.A.P.D. Gee, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

757
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,441
或许他们知道那里被劫
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

758
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:51,070
不是因为我们 而是因为那里以前曾多次被劫
The place, not us. Because it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

759
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,906
假设他们监听我们的电话住所
Assume they got our phones, assume they got our houses...

760
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:56,576
假设他们现在正在监视我们的一举一动
...assume they got us right here, right now as we sit.

761
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,703
假设一切
Everything. Assume it all.

762
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,955
我们要如何付科索银行的头期款？
How we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?

763
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:04,292
- 那不是问题，我会先垫 - 那凡赞那里呢？
- I'll front that. That's not a problem. - What happens to Van Zant?

764
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,462
警方在追查我们，你想和他开战吗？
With the heat we got, do you wanna play World War II in the streets with Van Zant?

765
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,548
不，我想要我的75万 而他却可以亳发无伤？
No, I want my 750. And he gets a pass?

766
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:15,052
我比你们更想杀了凡赞 但他现在成了奢侈品
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

767
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,638
问题是我们抢银行远是离去？
Our problem is, take the bank or split right now?

768
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:20,308
不要回家，不要收拾东西 什么都不要做
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

769
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,644
30秒后我们各自走我们的阳关道
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways.

770
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,062
就此结束
That's it.

771
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,814
克里斯
Chris.

772
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:32,153
值得冒险抢劫银行
The bank is worth the risk.

773
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:34,322
我需要钱
I need it, brother.

774
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:39,160
我认为我们应该留下来抢银行
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

775
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,757
你做什么我都会跟随，尼尔，任何事
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever. Whatever.

776
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:56,385
这次不行，麦克，你要自行决定
No, not on this one, Michael. On this one, you're on your own.

777
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,359
你觉得这是最好的作法吗？
You figure this is the best thing to do?

778
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:13,361
这是最好的作法吗？
This is the best thing to do?

779
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:17,782
我打算事成后收手，所以对我来说 风险也许值得
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for me the reward is maybe worth the stretch.

780
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,868
但伊莲很会理财，你存有很多钱
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

781
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:22,536
你有基金和地产
You got T-bonds, real estate.

782
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:26,082
如果我是你，就不会参与这次行动
If I were you, I would be smart. I would cut loose of this.

783
01:16:44,518 --> 01:16:48,229
对我来说，冒险才是我追求的
Well, you know, for me, the action is the juice.

784
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:49,438
我参加
I'm in.

785
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:54,944
你也是？
You too?

786
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:56,862
是，当然
Yeah, sure.

787
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,698
我们动手吧
Let's go.

788
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,741
去他们 的，我们行动吧
Fuck them, let's do it.

789
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:03,494
好，我们有很多事要做
All right, let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

790
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,843
- 你不能进去 - 你看着
- You can't go in there. - Watch this.

791
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:21,178
- 不好意思，那··· - 提姆，我再打给你
- Excuse me. That... - Tim, I gotta call you back.

792
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,805
你得先预约
You have to have an appointment.

793
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,807
- 有何贵干？ - 你是艾伦马西亚诺？
- Can I help you? - Are you Alan Marciano?

794
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:27,435
- 是，你是谁？ - 我是谁？
- Yeah, and who the fuck are you? - Who am I?

795
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:30,688
- 干什么 - 文森汉纳，洛城警局小队长
- Hey. Hey. - Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

796
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:34,108
洛城？这里是拉斯维加斯 不在你管辖范圉
L.A.? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

797
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:37,778
我不知道你们以为自己惹到了谁
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck you guys think you're pushing around...

798
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:43,284
- 我有认识人，好吗？ - 赌城警方可以拘留你
- ...but I know people here, okay? - Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.

799
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,912
引渡你回纽泽西的纽华克
You are extradited to Newark on a New Jersey warrant...

800
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,333
因为三年前，你从北卡罗来纳走私香烟
...for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago...

801
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,668
或你可以和我们合作
...or you go to work for us.

802
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,628
简单明了
Cut and dried.

803
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:57,631
- 就这样 - 该死
- That is it. - Oh, shit.

804
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,551
夏琳薛哈利斯
Charlene Shiherlis.

805
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,470
- 谁？ - 谁？
- Who? - Who?

806
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,805
谁？你是八哥吗？一直重复同样的话
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

807
01:18:05,182 --> 01:18:08,809
那个上星期每天和你在电话中 淫声秽语的女子
The lady you been talking dirty to on the telephone every day the last week.

808
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:11,228
你不能证明我和她有关系
Yeah, you know what? You can't tie me to her.

809
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:15,316
不需要，你肯定会回去纽泽西的 蠢货
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jack off.

810
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:19,362
我只是···我为和会和她牵扯上？
Oh, man, I just... Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?

811
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:22,239
因为她的屁股美妙动人！
Because she got a great ass!

812
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,911
你一头钻了进去
And you got your head all the way up it.

813
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,496
老天
Jesus.

814
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:34,668
当我想起屁股，女人的屁股
When I think of asses, a woman's ass...

815
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:37,171
就会不由自主
...something comes out of me.

816
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,591
- 那么？ - 小事一桩
- So? - So no big thing.

817
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:45,888
我只想知道她的丈夫和他们那伙人
All I want is her husband and his whole fucking crew.

818
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:48,349
你会和这位卓克警探合作
Now, you're gonna work with Sergeant Drucker here.

819
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:55,606
圣克里门提路和赫莫沙街
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.

820
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:58,442
我们在那里穿过栏栅，从那进入
That's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.

821
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,735
对
Right.

822
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:02,738
这里的保安系统不堪一击
The security systems around here are a joke.

823
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:10,037
逃走路线一是圣文森汤姆斯桥
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge, that's Escape Route Number 1.

824
01:19:10,956 --> 01:19:14,208
路线二，从安纳海姆上110号公路
Number 2, over here, Anaheim to the 110.

825
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,709
- 好 - 好吗？
- Good. - Okay?

826
01:19:15,877 --> 01:19:18,587
- 很好 - 明白吗？好，走吧
- Yeah. That's fine. - Got it? Good. Let's go.

827
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,571
他们回头望向···
They were looking back...

828
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,073
这方向
...in this direction.

829
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:48,242
贷柜设施？
A container facility?

830
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:52,955
- 偷货车运送？ - 太明显，对他们来说钱太少了
- For a cartage theft? - Too visible. Too lowball for them.

831
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:59,086
旁边是炼油厂，那边是废车场
Next door's an oil refinery, over there's a scrap yard.

832
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:03,757
炼油厂发薪用支票，没有现金
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around. Same for the scrap yard.

833
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:03,759
废车场也一样

834
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:09,472
也许他们想偷车轮盖
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

835
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:15,936
炼油厂和废车场？
A refinery and a scrap yard.

836
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:19,940
- 是怎么回事？ - 这就是我们想要搞清楚的
- What the hell is going on? - That's what we're trying to figure out.

837
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,943
我们以为已经搞清楚了
We thought we had it.

838
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:24,778
以为已经搞清楚了
Thought we had it.

839
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:39,001
我知道他们在看什么
I got an idea of what they were looking at.

840
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,216
- 你们想知道吗？ - 什么？
- You wanna know what they're looking at? - What?

841
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:50,012
这人真了不起，他真行
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?

842
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:54,058
这伙人很棒
This crew is good.

843
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:57,394
你们想知道他们在看什么吗？
You know what they were looking at?

844
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:58,979
什么？
What?

845
01:21:00,232 --> 01:21:01,899
我们
Us.

846
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,818
洛城警察
The L.A.P.D.

847
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,363
是警察部门
The police department.

848
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,157
我们被认出来了
We just got made.

849
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:19,375
是的
Yeah.

850
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,343
好
Okay.

851
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:39,562
好，杂种！
Okay, motherfucker!

852
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:01,834
科索交出来了吗？
Kelso come through?

853
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:05,212
交出来了，蓝图很详尽
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

854
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:14,054
那人姓汉纳，叫文森
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

855
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:18,601
我用五百元贿赂了一个警员 汉纳在监视你一举一动
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards. Hanna's all over you.

856
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:21,729
监视所有的车，还有麦克和薛哈利斯的家
He's on all the work cars. Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

857
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:24,231
没有监视你，因为不知道你晚上去哪里
Not yours, they've been losing you at night.

858
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,485
汉纳很积极，研究所，海军陆战队
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school. Marine Corps.

01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,779

860
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:34,241
逮捕了不少人 在芝加哥杀了法兰基杨德
He's taken down some heavy crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

861
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,660
他是个疯子
And he was a fucking maniac.

862
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:41,081
他之前在缉毒组工作，发生了些问题 离过两次婚
He was working Narcotics before that. Had some problems, divorced twice.

863
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:44,251
目前的太太叫贾丝汀 是他下令严密监视的
Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat.

864
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:48,422
我的刑警队警官线人
The Vice sergeant...

865
01:22:49,466 --> 01:22:51,759
说汉纳喜欢你
...says Hanna likes you.

866
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:55,846
认为你是明星，能做这做那
Thinks you're some kind of star. You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

867
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,974
行事很有技巧，很聪明
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

868
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:02,936
这一点也不好笑，结过三次婚
Funny as a heart attack, man. Three marriages.

869
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,398
你认为是为什么？他喜欢待在家？
What the fuck do you think that means? He likes staying home?

870
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:09,276
这代表他是那种
Means the man is one of those guys out there...

871
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:12,363
整晚工作的人，很投入
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

872
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,867
有他和警方监视，取消抢劫银行吧
With this guy and this much heat, you should pass.

873
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,626
值得冒险一试
It's worth the stretch.

874
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:31,465
他可以出错，而你一次都不能出错
This guy can hit and miss. You can't miss once.

875
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,634
你确定吗？
You sure?

876
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,969

I'm sure.

01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,311

This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18. Who have I got?

898
01:28:54,497 --> 01:28:56,832
麦克尼尔真的像他们说的那样不堪吗？
McNeil as tough as they say?

899
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,584
你想当监狱学者吗？
You looking to become a penologist?

900
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,200
你想再坐牢吗？
You're looking to go back?

901

我追捕了一些想犯错再度入狱的人
You know, I chase down some crews guys just looking to fuck up,

902
01:29:04,132 --> 01:29:08,553

910
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:32,409
那么就别再抢劫
Then don't take down scores.

911
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:36,204
我做我擅长做的事，抢劫

You do what you do best, trying to stop guys like me.

913
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,048
你从不想过正常生活？
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

914
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:49,217
那是什么？烤肉和看球赛吗？
What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?

915
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,095

- 像你一样正常的生活吗？ - 我的生活？不，我的生活
- This regular-type life like your life? - My life? No, my life...

917
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,689
我的生活一塌糊涂
No, my life's a disaster zone.

918
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:07,277
我的继女情绪深受困扰
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

919
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:10,530
因为她的生父是个大浑蛋
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

920
01:30:10,698 --> 01:30:14,576
我和太太，我们的婚姻正面临破碎边缘
I got a wife. We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage...

921
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:16,620
这是我的第三度婚姻
...my third...

922
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:21,708
因为我把所有时间都花在 追捕像你这样的人
...because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

923
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:23,919
那就是我的生活
That's my life.

924
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:31,968
有人曾对我说：
A guy told me one time:

925
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:35,514
“要了无牵挂
Don't let yourself get attached to anything...

926
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:38,391
随时可以一走了之
...you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat...

927
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:40,727
一旦感到风头不对时”
...if you feel the heat around the corner.

928
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:45,190
如果你想抓我，我行动时你也行动
Now, if you're on me, and you gotta move when I move...

929
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:48,527
你要如何才能保有婚姻呢？
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

930
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:52,572
这说法很有趣
Well, that's an interesting point.

931
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,951
你是出家人吗？
What are you, a monk?

932
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:57,911
我有女伴
I have a woman.

933
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:00,080
你怎么告诉她？
What do you tell her?

934
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:04,042
我说我是推销员
I tell her I'm a salesman.

935
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:13,927
那么你如果见我从街角走来
So then, if you spot me coming around that corner...

936
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:17,097
你会离开她？
...you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

937
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,058
不告而别？
Not say goodbye?

938
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:22,561
要有这样的自律
That's the discipline.

939
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,688
那心灵会很空虚，不是吗？
That's pretty vacant, no?

940
01:31:24,856 --> 01:31:26,523
正是如此
Yeah, it is what it is.

941
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:29,317
不这样做，我们还是另找职业吧
It's that, or we both better go do something else, pal.

942
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,238
我不懂做别的
I don't know how to do anything else.

943
01:31:33,823 --> 01:31:35,699
我也不懂
Neither do I.

944
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:41,621
- 我不想 - 我也不想
- I don't much want to either. - Neither do I.

945
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:52,883
我不断重复这梦境
You know, I have this recurring dream.

946
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:56,511
我坐在偌大的餐宴席上
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

947
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:00,557
我调查过的凶杀案受害人全部出席
...and all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting at this table...

948
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:04,978
他们用漆黑的眼珠子瞪着我
...and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

949
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:10,150
因为他们头部中枪出血
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

950
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,987
这些尸体发胀
And there they are, these big balloon people...

951
01:32:14,155 --> 01:32:17,240
因为他们被杀两周后 我才在床下发现他们
...because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

952
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:20,911
邻居报警说有恶臭
The neighbors reported the smell...

953
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:25,457
他们全部出席，坐在那里
...and there they are, all of them just sitting there.

954
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:28,210
他们说什么？
What do they say?

955
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:31,671
没说话
Nothing.

956
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:33,506
- 没人说话？ - 没人
- No talk? - None.

957
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:37,302
他们无话可说
Just... They don't have anything to say.

958
01:32:37,929 --> 01:32:40,347
我们彼此望着对方
See, we just look at each other.

959
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:45,644
他们望着我，就这样，梦境就是这样
They look at me. And that's it, that's the dream.

960
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,398
我有梦到自己溺水
I have one where I'm drowning.

961
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:54,236
我得叫醒自己起来呼吸 否则会死在梦里
And I gotta wake myself up and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

962
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:57,822
你知道这象征什么吗？
You know what that's about?

963
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:01,034
知道，要有足够的时间
Yeah. Having enough time.

964
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:07,791
- 足够时间，做你想做的事？ - 是的
- Enough time to do what you wanna do? - That's right.

965
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:13,380
- 你现在这样做？ - 还没有
- You doing it now? - No, not yet.

966
01:33:18,261 --> 01:33:20,553
我们坐在这里
You know, we're sitting here...

967
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:23,723
你和我，像两个普通人
...you and I, like a couple of regular fellows.

968
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:26,601
彼此做必须做的事
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

969
01:33:28,896 --> 01:33:31,898
现在我们见过面
And now that we've been face to face...

970
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:39,197
如果要我在案发现场杀你，我不会喜欢
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it.

971
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:40,699
但我告诉你
But I'll tell you...

972
01:33:43,244 --> 01:33:46,746
如果是在你和让你杀死···
...if it's between you and some poor bastard...

973
01:33:46,914 --> 01:33:49,416
妻子会成寡妇的人当中作选择
...whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

974
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:54,587
兄弟，没命的会是你
...brother, you are going down.

975
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:09,144
换另一面想
There's a flip side to that coin.

976
01:34:10,938 --> 01:34:15,275
如果你逼得我走投无路 我不得不杀你呢？
What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down?

977
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:21,281
因为不论如何，你都不能阻止我
Because no matter what, you will not get in my way.

978
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:24,909
是的，我们见过面
We've been face to face, yeah...

979
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:31,624
但我会亳不犹疑杀你，一秒也不会迟疑
...but I will not hesitate. Not for a second.

980
01:34:37,465 --> 01:34:39,799
也许真会这样
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

981
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:44,763
或是谁知道呢？
Or who knows?

982
01:34:44,972 --> 01:34:47,724
也许我们永远不会再见
Or maybe we'll never see each other again.

983
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,783
他们摆脱了我们
They dumped us.

984
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,410
什么？
What?

985
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:10,872
- 他们逃脱了 - 什么意思，逃脱了？
- They dumped us. - What do you mean, they dumped us?

986
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,123
克里斯逃脱了
Chris slipped his tail.

987
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:14,876
他没跟夏琳谈及抢劫的事
He doesn't talk about scores with Charlene...

988
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:17,629
所以无法从马西亚诺那边得到资料 我试过了
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I tried.

989
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:20,048
- 切利托？ - 也一样
- What about Cheritto? - Same.

990
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:22,967
监听询答机被放到 往圣克里门提的公车上
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

991
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:29,849
- 他们摆脱我们所有的监视？ - 是的，同一时间，晚上九点
- They dumped all our surveillance? - Yeah, at the same time. 9 p.m.

992
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:34,187
我半小时前才和麦考利喝咖啡！
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

993
01:35:34,355 --> 01:35:36,689
我们有跟踪，但之后麦考利开到机场
We were on you. Then McCauley drives into LAX...

994
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,859
我们无法靠近监视，因为飞行跑道
...where surveillance can't fly over because of flight paths.

995
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:43,363
他的车子仍在，人不见了
His car's still there. He's gone.

996
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:53,748
有谁知道他们在哪里吗？
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

997
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:54,100
他有联络吗？
You hear from him yet?

998
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:58,730
没有，这让我更不安，他在哪里？
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more. Where's this guy?

999
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:05,528
这个人，我们用他，他说他认识麦考利
This guy here. We put him on. Says he knows McCauley.

1000
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:11,743
你是谁？
Who are you?

1001
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:16,789
韦恩葛罗，我的名字是韦恩葛罗
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

1002
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:20,543
我躲在这办公室好多天了 你跟他很熟吗？
I've been living in this office day and night. How well do you know him?

1003
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:24,797
我们一起做了不少大买卖
Oh, we took some major scores together.

1004
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,802
他为何还没找上我？
How come I haven't heard from him?

1005
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:33,806
他可能在忙，但他做事很彻底
Well, he's probably busy right now, but he's real thorough.

1006
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:39,103
- 他不会忘记你的 - 真令人安心
- He ain't gonna forget about you. - Oh, that's reassuring.

1007
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:44,025
我可以做点事
Well, I got some moves I could make here.

1008
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:47,487
可能对你会很有帮助
Probably be a big help to you.

1009
01:38:08,509 --> 01:38:09,842
认得那个在烤肉的人吗？
You recognize the grill man?

1010
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:22,313
- 不认得 - 福松D座，和多比罗许同一囚室
- No. - Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1011
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:27,527
- 我还没休息 - 西斯科和潘乔没上班
- Ain't got my break yet, man. - Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1012
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:30,697
倒垃圾、拖餐厅后面的地
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1013
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:32,824
稍后再休息
Take your break later.

1014
01:38:32,992 --> 01:38:36,327
人渣，送出去吧
Piece of shit. Pick up.

1015
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:40,832
他在哪里？
Where the hell is he?

1016
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,335
- 我想弄一辆工作车 - 我也是
- I wanted to check the slot for a work car. - So did I.

1017
01:38:49,508 --> 01:38:50,925
是？
Yeah?

1018
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:53,636
等一等
Hang on.

1019
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,930
- 喂 - 喂
- Yeah. - Hey.

1020
01:38:56,098 --> 01:39:00,643
用普通电话，打103 - 7206
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.

1021
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,061
好
All right.

1022
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:15,074
- 你在哪里？ - 到处有警察监视我
- Where are you? - There's cops all over me, man.

1023
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:19,245
我无法摆脱他们
They're on me like a cheap suit. I can't dump them.

1024
01:39:21,749 --> 01:39:25,710
- 他们知道你看见他们了？ - 不，他们并行跟踪
- After the fact you spotted them? - No, no. They're doing parallels.

1025
01:39:28,589 --> 01:39:30,006
我可以再试着摆脱他们
I can try to dump them again.

1026
01:39:30,174 --> 01:39:34,552
我们怎么知道你是否摆脱了 如果没有，你会引他们来找我们
How are we gonna know if you did? If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

1027
01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:36,846
去文杜拉，把他们带离这里
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

1028
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:41,100
对不起，我真不想让你失望的
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man. Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

1029
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:05,708
快点
Come on, man.

1030
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:08,920
送出去
Pick up.

1031
01:40:09,672 --> 01:40:12,715
- 尼尔，你好吗？ - 你好吗？
- Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up? - What's up, brother?

1032
01:40:12,883 --> 01:40:15,259
你在这里做什么？
Man, what you doing here?

1033
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:19,180
我在找可以应付警方跟踪的司机
What I am doing is I'm looking for a driver who can handle scanners and a radio.

1034
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:20,390
现在就需要
Right now, today.

1035
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:21,974
你还记得怎么做吗？
You remember the drill?

1036
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:23,518
记得
Yeah, man, sure.

1037
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,019
你可以吗？
You cool?

1038
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,647
你知道我可以
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

1039
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:31,150
你现在就回答我，行或不行
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1040
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:47,375
好的，去他的，我答应
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1041
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:50,837
五分钟后到后面
Out back in five.

1042
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,473
- 什么烧焦了？什么烧焦了？ - 不是我
- What's burning? What's burning? - Nothing I'm doing.

1043
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,350
搞什么？
What is this?

1044
01:41:04,518 --> 01:41:06,686
你要去哪里？
Where do you think you're going?

1045
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:13,901
刚拿到手康丁斯基初版的 《颜色的理论》
Just came across a first edition of Kandinsky's Theory of Color.

1046
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:16,320

我的安娜死了

她死了
She's gone.

1178
01:58:49,707 --> 01:58:54,002
别这样扔下我，尼尔，求求你，兄弟
Don't leave me like this, Neil. Please, holmes.

1179
01:58:55,338 --> 01:58:58,048
别这样扔下我
Don't leave me like this.

1180

- 是？ - 奈特

1181
01:59:24,242 --> 01:59:26,910
你用行动电话吗？用普通电话
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1182
01:59:27,537 --> 01:59:28,703
这是新的电话
It's a new one.

1183
01:59:30,248 --> 01:59:33,041
他住在恩西诺区山景台
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1184
01:59:33,209 --> 01:59:36,545

- 10725. - 10725, okay.

1185
01:59:36,712 --> 01:59:39,923
- 克里斯呢？ - 他和我一起在我家中
- Chris? - He's with me, at my place.

1186
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:42,425
接下来查出韦恩葛罗在哪，好吗？
Next, Waingro, okay?

1187
01:59:44,554 --> 01:59:45,637
你有时间吗？
You got the time?

1188
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:49,975
我会抽空的，我要新的逃走路线
I'll make time, and I need a new out laid on.

1189
01:59:50,852 --> 01:59:52,102
你怎么知道旧路线被泄漏了？
How do you know it's blown?

1190
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:55,897
我怎么能保证没有呢？
How can I trust it?

1191
01:59:58,568 --> 02:00:00,443
好的
Okay, you got it.

1192
02:00:00,611 --> 02:00:02,654
保重
Stay healthy.

1193
02:00:07,743 --> 02:00:09,619
夏琳薛哈利斯
Charlene Shiherlis.

1194
02:00:10,371 --> 02:00:13,164
卓克在威尼斯区有地方可以让她藏身
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice to stash her in.

1195
02:00:13,332 --> 02:00:16,543
尼尔的逃走方法 这里处理完后，开始询查
Our Neil's transportation. When we're done here, get on the phone.

1196
02:00:16,711 --> 02:00:19,254
有人正在替他安排
Somewhere, someone's trying to put it together for him.

1197
02:00:19,422 --> 02:00:21,798
你不认为麦考利已经有计划？
You don't believe McCauley already had a getaway?

1198
02:00:21,966 --> 02:00:26,344
当然有，但他需要另一个计划 要是你，你还会相信原先的计划吗？
Sure he did. Now he needs another one. Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1199
02:00:27,388 --> 02:00:29,723
这告密的人，哪里找到他的？
This rat motherfucker, where did we get him?

1200
02:00:29,891 --> 02:00:33,435
他是机密线人，通报抢劫银行
He's a CI for a burglary cop. Called in the tip on the bank.

1201
02:00:33,603 --> 02:00:37,147
至于尼尔麦考利 我们还剩多少时间？
On Neil McCauley, how much time we got?

1202
02:00:37,315 --> 02:00:40,692
他有八到十小时安排新的逃走路线 之后就远走高飞了
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out. After that, he's gone.

1203
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,819
拜拜啦
Bye-bye. Bam.

1204
02:01:35,665 --> 02:01:40,085
你向我们告发麦考利，你怎么知道？ 是谁告诉你的
You ratted McCauley to us. How'd you know? Who told you?

1205
02:01:40,252 --> 02:01:42,879
谁告诉你的？你这告密者！
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1206
02:01:43,047 --> 02:01:44,673
是谁？
Who?

1207
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:15,954
康纳利针对墨菲 墨菲和莱格特一同对抗
Connelly back in for Murphy. Murphy with Leggat right there with him.

1208
02:02:16,122 --> 02:02:17,914
墨菲从网后准备出招
Murphy tees it up behind the net...

1209
02:02:22,086 --> 02:02:25,296
米勒跑到前头，墨菲与裁判争辩
...Miller out front. Now here's Murphy with the referee...

1210
02:02:28,884 --> 02:02:30,051
韦恩葛罗在哪里？
Waingro, where is he?

1211
02:02:31,429 --> 02:02:33,680
- 他在哪里？ - 我怎么知道？
- Where is he? - How the hell would I know?

1212
02:02:59,457 --> 02:03:03,376
这里有些什么？
Well, what do we have here, hmm?

1213
02:03:03,836 --> 02:03:07,464
这里漂亮吗？漂亮
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty.

1214
02:03:09,925 --> 02:03:12,969
- 你这卑鄙小人 - 你告诉我你想脱离目前困境
- You slimy piece of shit. - You told me you wanted out from under.

1215
02:03:13,137 --> 02:03:16,306
你快吓死了，对吧？ 你想脱身吧？这就是出路，夏琳
You're scared to death, right? You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1216
02:03:16,474 --> 02:03:20,143
- 你得到了什么好处？ - 我···蠢女人
- Yeah, what's your end? - I... You stupid broad.

1217
02:03:20,311 --> 02:03:22,771
- 我怎么会被牵连？ - 别冲动
- How'd I get into this? - Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

1218
02:03:22,938 --> 02:03:24,147
你听到了
You heard me.

1219
02:03:24,315 --> 02:03:27,358
她饱受惊吓，帮她倒杯酒
She had a rough ride. Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

1220
02:03:27,526 --> 02:03:30,528
- 去橱柜看看 - 去她的
- Look in the cabinet above the sink. - Fuck her.

1221
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:36,076
- 你最好进了橱柜就不要出来 - 好，乖
- You'd better get in there and stay in there. - All right, all right.

1222
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:41,081
听着
Well, lookie here.

1223
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,542
我叫卓克警探，洛杉矶警察局凶案组
My name is Sergeant Drucker, L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1224
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:48,713
- 你要让多明尼克在卧房睡吗？ - 他和我一起
- You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom? - He stays with me.

1225
02:03:49,215 --> 02:03:51,132
来吧
There we go.

1226
02:03:58,724 --> 02:04:00,683
现在怎样？
So, what now?

1227
02:04:02,937 --> 02:04:06,689
他说的对，你想脱身？这是出路
Well, he's right, because you want out, this is out.

1228
02:04:08,109 --> 02:04:11,986
- 你觉得你会出卖克里斯 - 废话
- You believe you have to betray Chris. - No shit.

1229
02:04:12,154 --> 02:04:15,115
对，你得这样做
That's right. You would have to.

1230
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:19,536
如果你不出卖克里斯 多明尼克会是受害人
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.

1231
02:04:20,037 --> 02:04:23,248
因为当你因从犯而入狱，他会变成孤儿
Because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1232
02:04:23,415 --> 02:04:25,875
你没有父母可以照顾他
...because you got no living parents to take him.

1233
02:04:26,043 --> 02:04:30,421
他会被送去寄养家庭、少年感化院
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes, juvenile facilities.

1234
02:04:30,589 --> 02:04:32,841
之后他会偷车
Then he steals a car.

1235
02:04:33,092 --> 02:04:38,263
然后不断入狱成为真正的罪犯
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1236
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:41,724
毁了一生
Fucked for life.

1237
02:04:41,892 --> 02:04:45,228
你是过来人，知道会有何下场
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1238
02:04:46,397 --> 02:04:51,568
多明尼克还没机会选择生活 但克里斯有
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life, but Chris did.

1239
02:04:52,653 --> 02:04:56,239
你如果供出克里斯，你不会有案底
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1240
02:04:56,407 --> 02:05:00,326
为孩子这样做，你才能抚养他
You can do it for your kid, so you can raise him.

1241
02:05:04,498 --> 02:05:07,876
- 你还要推销什么东西？ - 各种东西
- What else are you selling? - All kinds of shit.

1242
02:05:08,752 --> 02:05:13,965
但我不用说服你，因为我是对的
But I don't have to sell this and you know it, because this kind of shit here sells itself.

1243
02:05:20,264 --> 02:05:22,265
好，丹尼，最新消息
Okay, Danny, here's an update.

1244
02:05:22,433 --> 02:05:25,768
- 卓克在二线 - 小队长，等一下
- Drucker's on Line 2. - Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1245
02:05:27,938 --> 02:05:30,064
小队长，卓克在另一个电话线上
Lieutenant, I have Drucker on the other line.

1246
02:05:30,232 --> 02:05:31,608
三人通话吧
Oh, well, conference him in.

1247
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:36,821
- 说吧 - 文森，是我
- Go ahead. - Vincent, it's me.

1248
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:41,367
你的答案是什么？
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?

1249
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:50,460
我们准备好了，她会打电话
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1250
02:05:50,628 --> 02:05:53,796
好的，情况是这样
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1251
02:05:53,964 --> 02:05:59,802
休班尼已经改过自新 成为洗心革面的好公民
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born-again good citizen.

1252
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:04,515
显然一个叫韦恩葛罗的牛仔 向我们出卖尼尔
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

1253
02:06:04,683 --> 02:06:07,435
韦恩葛罗曾是尼尔的手下
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew...

1254
02:06:07,603 --> 02:06:11,189
后来替一个叫凡赞的洗钱人工作
...then he went to work for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1255
02:06:11,357 --> 02:06:17,153
小组正在凡赞家 因为他今晚较早前被杀
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1256
02:06:17,488 --> 02:06:20,823
如果尼尔还有谁要对付 那就是韦恩葛罗
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else, it's gonna be Waingro.

1257
02:06:20,991 --> 02:06:24,327
韦恩葛罗入住机场马奎斯酒店套房
Waingro just got himself a suite at the airport Marquis...

1258
02:06:24,495 --> 02:06:27,872
化名“詹姆森”，他现在在那
...under the name "Jameson". He's there now.

1259
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:31,125
我要你把这消息告诉保释人、组头
I want you to get that to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1260
02:06:31,293 --> 02:06:34,504
警员及线人
...assignment officers and snitches in County.

1261
02:06:34,672 --> 02:06:37,048
任何可以把消息传开的人
Anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street.

1262
02:06:37,216 --> 02:06:41,386
派人到酒店，并每隔半小时 亲自收听他们的无线电
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally check their come every 30 minutes.

1263
02:06:41,553 --> 02:06:45,640
因为也许尼尔会去找他，你感觉如何？
Because maybe Neil will go for him. Okay? How you feeling?

1264
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:49,602
- 浑身是伤，但我会熬过 - 好
- Banged up, but I'll live. - Okay.

1265
02:06:56,986 --> 02:06:58,861
他在这里
He's here.

1266
02:06:59,154 --> 02:07:01,364
尼尔还没走
Neil is still here.

1267
02:07:01,907 --> 02:07:03,866
我可以感觉到
I can feel it.

1268
02:07:04,118 --> 02:07:06,661
但他会留多久？
But for how long?

1269
02:07:07,246 --> 02:07:10,164
最多七八个小时
Seven, eight hours, max.

1270
02:07:18,549 --> 02:07:19,882
你干了什么？
What did you do?

1271
02:07:20,592 --> 02:07:24,304
- 是你做的？ - 我没做的比较重要，我不是卖金属的
- That was you? - It's what I don't do, I don't sell metal.

1272
02:07:24,471 --> 02:07:27,390
原本计划顺利，你之后离开 但现在出了点麻烦
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

1273
02:07:27,558 --> 02:07:31,561
- 我们要一起走 - 那些和你一起的人呢？
- Now we gotta go together. - Those other people were with you?

1274
02:07:33,689 --> 02:07:35,815
我的朋友，麦克
My friend, Michael...

1275
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:39,527
他知道冒的险有多大 他可以选择不要参加
...he knew the risks. He didn't have to be there.

1276
02:07:43,532 --> 02:07:46,159
不入虎穴，焉得虎子
It rains, you get wet.

1277
02:07:48,203 --> 02:07:49,412
快收拾东西，我们离开
Get packed and let's go.

1278
02:07:56,587 --> 02:07:59,255
伊迪
Eady.

1279
02:07:58,256 --> 02:07:59,298
伊迪

1280
02:08:09,016 --> 02:08:12,268
你为何这样对我？
Why did you do this to me?

1281
02:08:17,775 --> 02:08:19,817
你到底是谁？
Who are you?

1282
02:08:22,654 --> 02:08:25,782
会没事的，你懂吗？没事的
It's gonna be all right. You understand? It'll be all right.

1283
02:08:30,662 --> 02:08:32,789
不会有事的
It's gonna be all right.

1284
02:08:33,791 --> 02:08:35,416
好
Right.

1285
02:08:44,009 --> 02:08:47,637
这地址D层18单位 有一辆雪佛兰科迈罗
There's this Camaro at this address, Level D, Slot 18.

1286
02:08:52,351 --> 02:08:54,394
这里有现金
Here's some cash.

1287
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:58,147
这事什么时候会结束？
When's it over?

1288
02:09:01,652 --> 02:09:03,194
22小时后
22 hours from now.

1289
02:09:03,654 --> 02:09:07,365
- 我们就可以脱身 - 你何时会让我离开？
- Then we get out of here clean. - When will you let me leave?

1290
02:09:11,286 --> 02:09:14,163
你想走？现在可以走，门在那里
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1291
02:09:14,832 --> 02:09:16,999
你之后会让我离开吗？
Will you let me leave later?

1292
02:09:22,089 --> 02:09:24,298
情况会不同
It will be different.

1293
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:27,510
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,542
准备好了
It's ready.

这是我的朋友雷夫
This is my friend Ralph.

1297
02:10:09,303 --> 02:10:11,262
你没有告诉我你有···
You didn't tell me you were...

1298
02:10:12,347 --> 02:10:15,224
- 我的天 - 萝伦呢？
- Oh, my God. - Where's Lauren?

1299
02:10:15,392 --> 02:10:18,603
- 她在丽莎贝丝家 - 听着，这事和我无关
- She's at Lisa-Beth's. - Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1300
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:22,690
- 我不知道她结婚了，我很抱歉 - 你抱歉什么，坐下
- I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry. - What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1301
02:10:23,358 --> 02:10:25,401
你不生气吗？
Don't you even get angry?

1302
02:10:25,569 --> 02:10:28,070
我生气，是的
I'm angry, yeah.

1303
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:30,656
我很生气，雷夫
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1304
02:10:30,824 --> 02:10:33,910
你知道吗？如果你想要上我太太 而且她同意，你可以上
You know, you can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1305
02:10:35,496 --> 02:10:38,581
你可以躺在她的沙发上
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1306
02:10:39,917 --> 02:10:42,210
可以待在她前夫的
In her ex-husband's...

1307
02:10:42,377 --> 02:10:47,423
低科技、后现代主义的荒谬家中 如果你想要的话
...dead-tech, post-modernistic, bullshit house, if you want to...

1308
02:10:49,259 --> 02:10:55,598
但你不能看我该死的电视机
...but you do not get to watch my fucking television set!

1309
02:10:55,766 --> 02:10:57,266
有没有搞错！
For God's sake.

1310
02:11:03,815 --> 02:11:05,608
把电视机放下
Put the television set down.

1311
02:11:05,776 --> 02:11:08,319
- 我从没对你不忠，贱人 - 也许你应该
- I never cheated on you, bitch. - Maybe you should have.

1312
02:11:08,487 --> 02:11:10,780
- 我应该吗？ - 这不是你自找的吗？
- I should have? - In a way, you're a party to this.

1313
02:11:10,948 --> 02:11:13,991
对，是我要雷夫干你 因为这样我会很开心
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good.

1314
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:15,326
我们的处境很荒谬
Our situation is absurd.

1315
02:11:17,037 --> 02:11:21,874
- 听着，也许我应该··· - 闭嘴，雷夫，坐下！
- Look, maybe I should... - Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!

1316
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:27,880
为什么总是我得搞清楚我们之间的事 并向你解释？你做了什么？
Why is it that I have to figure things out and explain them to you? What do you do?

1317
02:11:28,048 --> 02:11:31,884
- 我不拐弯抹角，而且我说到做到 - 真令人敬佩
- I say what I mean, and I do what I say. - Mm, how admirable.

1318
02:11:32,052 --> 02:11:34,136
- 是的 - 除了和我们有关的事以外
- You bet. - Except none of it's about us.

1319
02:11:34,972 --> 02:11:36,013
不
No.

1320
02:11:37,474 --> 02:11:41,060
我也许沉溺于大麻和百忧解之中
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac...

1321
02:11:41,228 --> 02:11:43,854
但你在我们的生活中如同死了
...but you've been walking through our life dead.

1322
02:11:44,022 --> 02:11:48,693
我得自贬身价，找上雷夫 以便终断我们的关系
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1323
02:12:01,248 --> 02:12:03,499
护照、旅行支票、信用卡
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1324
02:12:04,167 --> 02:12:09,005
在洛杉矶机场包机站十七号机库
The plane, charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1325
02:12:09,172 --> 02:12:10,923
呼叫信号是1011S
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1326
02:12:14,303 --> 02:12:18,014
飞机会降落，等你五分钟后便会起飞
Touches down, holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1327
02:12:18,181 --> 02:12:21,684
飞机会通过航空局检查等手续
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.

1328
02:12:23,687 --> 02:12:26,022
- 克里斯呢？ - 他走了
- Hey, where's Chris? - He's gone.

1329
02:12:27,482 --> 02:12:28,524
什么？
What?

1330
02:12:29,151 --> 02:12:31,694
他说他要去找夏琳
Said he's going on his own. Went to look for Charlene.

1331
02:12:31,862 --> 02:12:34,697
- 你不是把他带来了这里了？ - 我有
- Didn't you bring him here? - Yeah, I brought him here.

1332
02:12:35,157 --> 02:12:36,991
怎么回事？
What happened?

1333
02:12:37,159 --> 02:12:39,535
这是个自由国家
It's a free country, brother.

1334
02:12:43,957 --> 02:12:48,377
晚上九点联络我，确保一切妥当
Check in with me at 9. Everything's still cool.

1335
02:12:49,713 --> 02:12:51,380
好
All right.

1336
02:13:13,945 --> 02:13:16,906
我已经不知道自己在做什么
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

1337
02:13:19,785 --> 02:13:21,994
我知道人生苦短
I know life is short.

1338
02:13:22,245 --> 02:13:24,872
能活多久是运气
Whatever time you get is luck.

1339
02:13:27,084 --> 02:13:29,168
你想离开？
You wanna walk?

1340
02:13:31,421 --> 02:13:33,714
你现在就离开
You walk right now.

1341
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,926
不然就你自愿···
Or on your own...

1342
02:13:37,094 --> 02:13:40,137
你选择自愿跟我走
On your own, you choose to come with me.

1343
02:13:46,228 --> 02:13:48,270
我只知道
All I know is...

1344
02:13:50,065 --> 02:13:54,402
到任何地方去对我都无所谓
All I know is there's no point in me going anywhere anymore...

1345
02:13:54,945 --> 02:13:57,029
如果我得独自一人
...if it's gonna be alone...

1346
02:13:57,948 --> 02:13:59,740
没有你在身边
...without you.

1347
02:14:06,581 --> 02:14:08,165

好，我等
Okay, I'll hold.

1350
02:15:05,348 --> 02:15:06,724
亲爱的，让克里斯看见你吧
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1351
02:15:07,851 --> 02:15:09,685
- 是啊，快去做 - 住口！
- Yeah, do it. - Shut up!

1352
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:16,650
只需要在窗前站一秒
Now, just one second at the window...

1353
02:15:17,444 --> 02:15:19,195
此事就会了结
...and it's all over.

1354
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,848
伙计
Hey, man.

1355
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:13,058
- 是？ - 你知道···
- Yeah? - You know any, uh...

1356
02:17:13,226 --> 02:17:16,020
这附近有地方出租吗？
...place to rent around here?

1357
02:17:17,105 --> 02:17:18,230
有
Yeah.

1358
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:20,983
载尔大道上的亚伯理兹杂货店 墙上有招租告示
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.

1359
02:17:21,151 --> 02:17:22,192
好，谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

1360
02:17:33,413 --> 02:17:36,081
不是他，不是克里斯
It's not him. It's not Chris.

第二小组，这是指挥部

拦阻他并查看身份
Take him at the street and check him out.

1363

Ran it to DMV. It's clean.

1368

1369
02:18:31,221 --> 02:18:33,555
非常谢谢，晚安

1370
02:18:35,308 --> 02:18:37,267
不是他，文森
It's a no-go, Vince.

1371

02:22:59,989 --> 02:23:01,949
该死
Shit.

1393
02:23:02,825 --> 02:23:04,826
让我绑紧
Let me tighten this.

1394
02:23:10,333 --> 02:23:12,334
这样浪费生命
What a fucking waste.

1395
02:23:12,502 --> 02:23:14,836
好，这里
Okay, here.

1396
02:23:15,672 --> 02:23:21,385
浑蛋经常自毁，你不会死的 宝贝，你不会的
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day. Not you, baby. Not you.

她会在哪里？她叫萝伦 萝伦古丝塔芙森
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.

1398
02:23:29,852 --> 02:23:32,104
她应该在这里，但警方告诉我···
I'm supposed to be here with her. But the police...

1399
02:23:39,028 --> 02:23:42,197
- 我需要人帮忙··· - 没关系，我可以

I want you to get a trauma surgeon and a vascular surgeon.

1407
02:24:07,849 --> 02:24:11,101
她好像割断了两条动脉，几乎没有脉搏
I think she cut both arteries. Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

1408
02:24:11,269 --> 02:24:14,604
她的血压和呼吸下降，要给她插管
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration. You have to intubate her.

1409
02:24:14,772 --> 02:24:16,481

- 你在哪里找到她的？ - 浴缸
- Where did you find her? - The bathtub.

1412
02:24:24,574 --> 02:24:28,118
叫呼吸科，给她注射大针管的盐水
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore normal saline. Wide open.

1413
02:24:28,286 --> 02:24:31,413
持续对出血的血管施压 需要两公升O型血
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders. I need two units, O-negative.

1414
02:24:31,581 --> 02:24:34,624
- 查出她血型和再输六公升 - 似乎有窦性心搏过速
- Let's type and cross her for six. - Looks like she's in sinus tach.

1415
02:24:34,792 --> 02:24:36,668
呼吸专家呢？我们需要帮忙
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.

1416
02:24:36,836 --> 02:24:38,628
快叫呼吸科医生过来
Can you have Respiratory come now?

1417
02:24:38,796 --> 02:24:41,506
准备插管后照胸腔X光
Let's have x-ray ready for post-intubation chest x-ray.

1418
02:24:46,512 --> 02:24:51,141

Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1419

她情况稳定 医生很快会出来跟你们解释
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will be out to speak to you in a few moments.

1420
02:24:55,646 --> 02:24:57,522
- 她没事吧？ - 她很好
- She's okay? - She's doing good.

1421
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:59,858
- 她会没事的 - 她会没事的
- She's gonna be okay. - She's gonna be okay.

1422
02:25:00,026 --> 02:25:02,903
- 她不会有事 - 我的宝贝
- Oh, my baby. - She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1423
02:25:03,071 --> 02:25:06,198
- 没事了 - 她为何这样对自己？
- It's all right. - Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

1424
02:25:06,366 --> 02:25:10,577
看她把自己怎么了
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1425
02:25:11,621 --> 02:25:13,455
别难过
There.

1426
02:25:13,873 --> 02:25:16,792
没事的，不会有事的
It's all right, honey. It's gonna be all right.

1427
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:19,002
我在这里，我哪里也不去
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1428
02:25:19,170 --> 02:25:20,212
- 明白吗？ - 好
- You understand? - Yeah.

1429
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:22,464
我哪里也不去
I ain't going anywhere.

1430
02:25:35,269 --> 02:25:36,269
是？
Yeah?

1431
02:25:36,771 --> 02:25:37,771
是我
It's me.

1432
02:25:38,356 --> 02:25:41,608
飞机己在半空，会准时抵达
Plane's in the air now. It'll be right on time.

1433
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:45,821
仍找不到可信任的司机
On the driver's end, I still can't find nobody, so that's in the trust.

1434
02:25:45,988 --> 02:25:47,864
还有一事
One other thing.

1435
02:25:48,324 --> 02:25:49,908
你既然问了，我就告诉你
You asked, so I gotta tell you.

1436
02:25:50,743 --> 02:25:53,620
你要找的人在马奎斯酒店 化名“詹姆森”
The guy you wanted checked into the Marquis under "Jameson"...

1437
02:25:53,788 --> 02:25:57,165
如果你还在乎他的话 我猜你不会想找他
...if you still give a shit, which I figured you wouldn't.

1438
02:25:57,333 --> 02:26:01,086
- 你说得对 - 再见，兄弟
- You figured right. - So, so long, brother.

1439
02:26:02,797 --> 02:26:04,756
保重了
You take it easy.

1440
02:26:04,924 --> 02:26:06,508
你就要到终点了
You're home free.

1441
02:26:08,261 --> 02:26:10,220
保重
Take it easy.

1442
02:26:20,565 --> 02:26:23,316
- 怎么了？ - 没什么
- What is it? - Nothing.

1443
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:25,026
终点
Home free.

1444
02:27:02,982 --> 02:27:05,901
- 我得解决一些事情 - 有时间吗？
- I gotta take care of something. - Is there time?

1445
02:27:06,903 --> 02:27:08,570
有的
There's time.

1446
02:27:36,974 --> 02:27:40,101
我很快回来，车子不要熄火
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1447
02:28:21,519 --> 02:28:23,979
- 入住登记 - 是，这是客房服务
- Registration. - Yeah, this is Room Service.

1448
02:28:24,146 --> 02:28:27,983
一个叫詹姆森的点了培根生菜三明治 但房号弄错了，可以告诉我吗？
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up his room number. Could you give it to me?

1449
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:30,026
- 他们经常弄错 - 是，我知道
- They're always doing that. - Yeah, I know.

1450
02:28:30,194 --> 02:28:33,280
- 是1735号房 - 谢谢
- 1735. - Thank you.

1451
02:30:16,759 --> 02:30:18,468
请注意
Your attention, please.

1452
02:30:18,636 --> 02:30:21,888
我们现在有火灾警报
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1453
02:30:22,056 --> 02:30:25,433
请不要惊慌，请不要乘坐电梯
Please do not panic. Please do not take the elevators.

1454
02:30:29,438 --> 02:30:32,065
- 该死 - 韦恩葛罗没有动静，我留在这
- Shit. - Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.

1455
02:30:32,233 --> 02:30:35,819
我去查看楼梯，如果有烟，会叫你离开
I'm checking the stairs. If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

1456
02:30:40,116 --> 02:30:42,534
她父亲呢？要我通知她父亲吗？
What about her dad? You want me to call him?

1457
02:30:43,536 --> 02:30:46,371
他在内华达山某处
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1458
02:30:47,832 --> 02:30:49,999
而且她选了你
And she chose you.

1459
02:30:52,002 --> 02:30:54,379
选在你的房间自杀
She picked your place.

1460
02:30:55,923 --> 02:30:57,403
这种事不应该发生在她身上
It's not right, what happened to her.

1461
02:30:59,051 --> 02:31:00,385
是的，不应该
No, it's not.

1462
02:31:03,806 --> 02:31:05,849
是的
Ugh, okay.

1463
02:31:16,026 --> 02:31:18,153
有没有办法···
Is there any way...

1464
02:31:20,114 --> 02:31:22,615
能克服我们之间的问题？
...that it could work out between us?

1465
02:31:24,994 --> 02:31:27,579
我希望能说有
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1466
02:31:27,747 --> 02:31:31,040
可是终究···
But in the end...

1467
02:31:35,504 --> 02:31:37,672
像你说的
You know, it's like you said:

1468
02:31:40,384 --> 02:31:45,054
我一生全奉献给被我追捕的罪犯
All I am, is what I'm going after.

1469
02:31:51,937 --> 02:31:54,856
我不是你想要的人，贾丝汀
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1470
02:32:05,326 --> 02:32:07,952
如果你需要走就走吧
Well, go on, if you have to.

1471
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:09,704
不
No.

1472
02:32:09,997 --> 02:32:13,208
- 我可以留下来 - 我没事，我可以应付
- I'll stay. - No, I'm okay. I can... I can handle this.

1473
02:32:16,378 --> 02:32:18,379
你自己小心
Just be careful.

1474
02:32:18,631 --> 02:32:21,382
打电话到这里给我，让我知道你没事
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1475
02:32:22,301 --> 02:32:23,843
好吗？
Okay?

1476
02:33:05,719 --> 02:33:06,761
走楼梯
Take the stairs.

1477
02:33:20,734 --> 02:33:21,776
谁？
Yeah?

1478
02:33:23,988 --> 02:33:28,157
酒店保全，三楼发生火警 各楼层的人都得疏散
Security. There's a fire on 3. We have to evacuate all the floors.

1479
02:33:28,325 --> 02:33:29,951
我不能离开
I can't leave here.

1480
02:33:38,836 --> 02:33:42,255
我们何不先谈一下？
Why don't we just talk about this a bit, huh, brother?

1481
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:57,312
他在17楼
He's here on 17.

1482
02:34:00,482 --> 02:34:02,817
看着我，看着我
Look at me. Look at me.

1483
02:34:06,155 --> 02:34:07,322
看着我
Look at me.

1484
02:34:39,229 --> 02:34:43,107
洛城警察，别动！手放在头上！
L.A.P.D. Don't move. Put your hands on your head, now.

1485
02:35:18,227 --> 02:35:20,561
将我换到五号频道
Switch me to TAC 5.

1486
02:35:20,729 --> 02:35:23,064
卡萨尔？ J J ？
Casals? JJ?

1487
02:35:23,983 --> 02:35:25,191
卓克，J J ？
Drucker, JJ?

1488
02:35:25,359 --> 02:35:27,902
文森，我在大厅的楼梯旁
I'm at the lobby level by the stairwell.

1489
02:35:28,070 --> 02:35:29,070
有什么消息？
What have you got?

1490
02:35:29,238 --> 02:35:32,407
小组得乘坐其他的电梯去17楼
Teams are moving up the other elevators to the 17th floor elevators.

1491
02:35:32,574 --> 02:35:34,742
因为火警，电梯不能使用
All out of commission because of the fire alarm.

1492
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:38,037
- 现场一团混乱 - 好，收到
- It's a mess. People everywhere. - Fine. 10-4.

1493
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:09,444
赶快离开
Let's go, get out of the way.

1494
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:11,529
不要挡路
Stay out of the way.

1495
02:36:19,455 --> 02:36:22,498
快，走那边，好吗？快点
Let's go. Go that way. We gotta go, all right? Go, go.

1496
02:36:25,627 --> 02:36:27,545
我知道了，长官
I got it, sir.

1497
02:36:29,673 --> 02:36:31,591
快点，快点
Come on, come on.

1498
02:36:37,431 --> 02:36:39,057
快走，先生
Come on, sir.

1499
02:36:43,312 --> 02:36:46,314
- 小心后面，女士们 - 我知道了
- Watch your backs, ladies. - I got it, I got it.

1500
02:36:48,984 --> 02:36:50,651
继续走，夫人
Keep moving, ma'am.

1501
02:36:51,487 --> 02:36:52,570
走
Let's go.

1502
02:36:55,074 --> 02:36:56,324
继续走
Come on, let's go.

1503
02:37:30,943 --> 02:37:32,610
走这边，夫人
This way, ma'am.

1504
02:37:34,571 --> 02:37:36,364
后退，后退
Get back, get back.

1505
02:38:02,224 --> 02:38:04,642
- 把散弹枪给我 - 是的，长官
- Let me have that shotgun. - Yes, sir.

1506
02:44:22,103 --> 02:44:24,855
我告诉过你，我不会回去坐牢的
Told you I'm never going back.

1507
02:44:28,193 --> 02:44:29,818
没错
Yeah.

1508
02:50:14,915 --> 02:50:15,916
