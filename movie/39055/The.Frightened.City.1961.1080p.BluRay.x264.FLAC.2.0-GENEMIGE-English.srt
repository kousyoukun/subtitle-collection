1
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:18,518
No, no!

2
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:06,635
Yes?

3
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:08,402
Come on, dear.

4
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:12,694
- What do you think you're doing?
- In you go, darling!

5
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:15,569
- Pardon me, all.
- Here! What you...

6
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:18,953
Hello? What's going on here?

7
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:26,855
What are you lot doing in here?

8
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:30,444
Shut up! Shut up!

9
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:33,652
Stand over there and you won't get hurt.

10
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:20,010
Come on. Wait here.

11
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:33,296
- Mind what you're doing!
- Oh, darling, keep still.

12
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:41,652
Well, I'd say that somebody
doesn't like you, mr moffat.

13
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:44,819
Inspector sayers. Who sent for you?

14
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:50,027
Someone with more sense than you,
obviously. Who was it, Frankie farmer?

15
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,611
Wasn't like that at all.

16
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:54,652
Some of the members got excited
and started a bit of a ruck.

17
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,551
Oh, sure, sure.

18
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:00,111
Are you going to pay them
what they want now?

19
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:04,194
And if I don't? How many men can you spare
to guard me for the rest of my life?

20
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:06,152
Are you going to make a charge about this?

21
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,426
What do you think?

22
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,543
Come on.

23
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,111
If some of these people had the guts
to take 'em to court,

24
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:34,486
we'd cut this protection racket in two
before it got off the ground.

25
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,527
Well, you heard him.
We can't watch 'em round the clock.

26
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:39,444
It's a nasty alternative.

27
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:43,548
Want to do anything about Frankie?

28
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,861
Any idea where he is?

29
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:49,527
My information is, he's usually at
Maggie seely's place about this time.

30
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:52,361
Why can't these villains
work decent hours?

31
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,694
You know, that's the third club
he's done this week.

32
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:57,277
Things are hotting up.

33
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,111
What we want's an iron man in this town.

34
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:03,277
Someone like old Percy sillitoe
up in sheffield.

35
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:05,194
- Remember?
- Yeah.

36
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:09,986
What we want are laws designed to catch
villains and not hamper the police.

37
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,611
Now drive on, macduff, and less chat.

38
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,486
I've got to work out
an explanation for the wife

39
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,390
why I haven't been home
before midnight all month.

40
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,194
Well, what do you think?

41
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,402
I think you're in trouble, mr wingrove.

42
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,652
Well, of course I am.
That's why I've come to you.

43
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:42,319
I can't help you, my friend.

44
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:46,444
Look, all I need is £20,000
to bridge the gap.

45
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:48,486
You've raised more than that in the past.

46
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,819
Oh, yes, very much more, but only
when the risk was infinitesimal.

47
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:56,027
I can't recommend investment in a company
like wingrove construction,

48
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:57,236
not on these figures.

49
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,736
But we're under way.
The contracts have all been signed.

50
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,194
We've been working on the building
for a month now.

51
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:04,777
You've got a tight schedule, mr wingrove.

52
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,861
In my opinion, you'll be extremely lucky
to complete on time.

53
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:11,527
And look at that penalty clause
if you overrun.

54
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,301
£2,000 a week.

55
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:16,319
We won't overrun,
there's too much at stake.

56
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,944
All the same,

57
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,468
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:21,593
Miss rush.

59
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,736
Yes, mr zhernikov.

60
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,069
Would you get mr wingrove
his hat and coat, please?

61
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,443
Yes, sir.

62
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:33,277
But haven't you got any suggestions?

63
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:35,319
How am I going to get out of this?

64
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:38,402
Mr wingrove, I'm an accountant
not Houdini.

65
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:42,236
But one word from you...
"Words are but sands.

66
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,986
Money buys lands."
And old Russian proverb.

67
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,736
See Harvey gonning.
He's got resources.

68
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,111
Goodbye, mr wingrove.

69
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,551
j but I'm not laughing

70
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,560
j now j.

71
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,981
Anya, please.

72
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:12,093
In moderation?

73
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,152
Everything in moderation.

74
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,069
I'm sorry, darling.

75
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:18,652
- How's it going?
- Waldo...

76
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,819
Can't you help me to get some work?

77
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,968
I know I'm ready.

78
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,611
- Yes, miss rush?
- Oh, mr foulcher telephoned earlier, sir.

79
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,069
- He wants to make an appointment.
- Yes, miss rush? Go and make one then.

80
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:36,319
Yes, sir.

81
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:38,027
Oh, miss rush.

82
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,611
Did you telephone the ministry of labour
about a work permit for miss bergolin?

83
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:45,527
Oh, yes, sir.
I've made a note of it.

84
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:49,652
Um... "The granting of work permits
to foreign artists

85
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:53,236
is governed solely by the availability
of British performers

86
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,111
of similar talent and experience."

87
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,635
Thank you.

88
00:08:57,843 --> 00:08:59,718
Thank you, sir.

89
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,194
So where's the problem?

90
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:06,236
Pretty girl like you
and with a voice as well.

91
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,152
How unique do you need to be?

92
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:10,277
No one will give me a job
without experience

93
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,444
and I can't get experience
without a permit.

94
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,611
Oh, Waldo, all I need is for someone
to give me a chance.

95
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:19,819
But I don't know anybody in
that line of business, my darling.

96
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:20,893
Ordo I?

97
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:23,676
Wait.

98
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:26,944
Miss rush.

99
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:29,902
- One moment, please.
- Mr foulcher?

100
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:33,444
Ask if it's convenient for me
to call at his place. Er, what is it?

101
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:35,402
- The taboo club.
- Right.

102
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:38,736
But this is a business appointment, sir.
Well?

103
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,277
Well, it's just that I thought
as you never...

104
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,944
So, I've changed the habits of a lifetime.

105
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:45,777
Does the entitle you
to flounder like a fish?

106
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:49,902
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- Get on with it then.

107
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:53,361
Waldo, what sort of place is the taboo?

108
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:57,486
Well, it's not exactly the palladium,
but, er...

109
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,861
It's got a certain distinctive style
of its own, shall we say?

110
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:15,611
j what a marvellous lie you told me

111
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:19,236
j' in your arms on our wedding day

112
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,194
j when you promised
to have and to hold me

113
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:27,069
j and to love and adore all the way

114
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,861
j when life tore us apart,
you were sure you could wait

115
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:35,444
j now you've found out
that the odds are too great

116
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,194
j what a marvellous lie you told me

117
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:43,298
j but I'll never believe you again.

118
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:08,569
I hope your interest is purely
professional, mr zhernikov.

119
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,819
I was just reflecting.

120
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:13,319
Herein lies the nub of all trade.

121
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:18,444
They've got it, we want it, so up spring
a thousand crafts to smooth the exchange.

122
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:21,444
You know what you're doing, Harry.
Sex is a wonderful thing for business.

123
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:22,569
I'm happy to say.

124
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,486
j in your arms... j

125
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,527
- pretty girl.
- Well, if you're interested, I...

126
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:32,611
Not the way you think.
Is she good?

127
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:36,319
Well, her voice isn't so hot but she seems
to know what the customers want.

128
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:40,194
How would you like a girl with
equal sex appeal and also a voice?

129
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,361
You going into the agency business,
mr zhernikov?

130
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,736
Just this once.

131
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,486
Well, send her down,
I'll audition her myself.

132
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,902
Thank you. Harry.

133
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:49,652
Audition only the voice,
not the sex appeal?

134
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,236
This girl is my, er...
A relative of mine.

135
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,361
I wouldn't cross you,
you know that, mr zhernikov.

136
00:11:54,385 --> 00:11:56,135
Come right in.

137
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,986
And, Harry, no need to advertise
the connection?

138
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,486
Anything you say.

139
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,444
So now, what did you want
to see me about?

140
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:07,611
Well, something very much in your line.

141
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:11,955
Just a little problem I've run into.

142
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,611
This is a problem?

143
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,069
It will be when the revenue
ask where I got it.

144
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:21,069
- I'm your adviser, tell me.
- Well, let's say, insurance premiums.

145
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:22,402
Protection?

146
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:23,986
If you like.

147
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,486
And your own accountant
doesn't want to know?

148
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,986
He'd have a blue fit.

149
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,861
He's just a straight man I use
for the legit books in the club.

150
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:34,361
What opportunities they miss,
these scout masters.

151
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:37,111
I'm in a sweet position here.

152
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,010
On the surface.

153
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,194
With a club for a front,
I've got the perfect answer

154
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,569
for any reasonable amount
of bent income that comes my way.

155
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,777
But this is getting to be
an embarrassment.

156
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,194
I can't bank it.
The bogeys know all the strong rooms.

157
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,319
It's too much to write up
to gambling wins.

158
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,027
And if I invest it, the tax boys
will find out eventually.

159
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,611
If I leave it lying around here
much longer,

160
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:58,152
sure as €ggs are €ggs,
some crook's gonna try and lift it.

161
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,777
I've got a couple of companies
with international contacts.

162
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:03,069
I think I can lose it for you
through them.

163
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,652
What's the bite?

164
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,676
Twenty per cent.

165
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:10,361
I'm in your hands, mr zhernikowv.

166
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:12,069
All right, Harry.

167
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,944
- Glass of bubbly?
- No, thank you.

168
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:18,402
Tell me, how much do you make this way?

169
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:21,944
- The thick end of 300 last week.
- And net?

170
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,986
Hundred and, er...
Hundred and forty-six.

171
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,944
Why so big a drop?

172
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:28,652
Legal fees, operating expenses,
boys' cut, mainly.

173
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,736
How many boys you got?

174
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,736
Three right lunatics full-time
and a dozen on reserve.

175
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,736
- How often do you use the reserves?
- Most of the time, lately.

176
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,277
Some of the other mobs are
trying to creep on to my manor.

177
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:44,611
What's the average fee
you extract from each place?

178
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:47,111
About a tenner a week, I'd say.

179
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,444
What kind of places?

180
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:52,111
Pubs, clubs, coffee bars,

181
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:59,694
striptease joints, car dealers,
delicatessens, things in that line.

182
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:02,343
Something the matter?

183
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,611
I'm getting a feeling.

184
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,402
I've got a nose for profit, Harry.

185
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:10,444
So have I. There's the proof.

186
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:13,111
Oh, more than that, much more.

187
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:16,361
You wouldn't be interested in this level
of operation, would you, mr zhernikov?

188
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:19,444
Not as it is, but it might
become interesting.

189
00:14:19,468 --> 00:14:21,569
How many gangs are working this way?

190
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:24,986
About a dozen, I'd say, but most of those
are tearaways with no organisation.

191
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,277
There aren't more than six real mobs.

192
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:30,861
And every one of them is wasting its time
fighting off the others?

193
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:34,069
That's about the ticket, yeah.

194
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,861
Could you get the other
five top men together?

195
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,235
Together?

196
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:44,615
I suppose I could, yeah. Why?

197
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,968
Why?

198
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:49,402
Do you realise the potential here?

199
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:51,736
If you six split up the town between you,

200
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,736
think how that would increase your
turnover and reduce your outgoings.

201
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,902
Nah. It'll never work.
These are suspicious animals.

202
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:02,444
This is a job for public relations, Harry.
The theme is unity.

203
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,843
Form a trade union!

204
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:09,527
I don't quite get your interest,
mr zhernikov.

205
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:12,194
All the boys will be in your spot,
won't they?

206
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:16,319
Well, I serve them the same way then,
at the same price, 20%.

207
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:17,944
Sounds reasonable.

208
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:21,236
This can be a once-in-a-lifetime thing,
Harry, but we've got to think big.

209
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,069
Listen, we'll have to make
a fighting fund,

210
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,902
for bribes, legal advice
and general emergencies.

211
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,444
We shall have to agree that each gang
puts 10% of its take into a central kitty.

212
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:35,486
I'll match whatever sum you put in for
a few months to help get things floated.

213
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,444
That kitty's gonna be a pretty big cat
before very long, isn't it?

214
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:41,027
Every six months we distribute it
in the form of a dividend,

215
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,111
leaving just enough in
for running expenses.

216
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:48,027
- Now, is this making sense?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, very much so.

217
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:49,051
Right.

218
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,152
Your first job then, Harry,
is to get the boys together.

219
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:55,069
Well, what's the matter?

220
00:15:55,093 --> 00:16:00,402
I was just thinking, the law would go
bleedin' potty if they knew about this.

221
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,026
They will, when it's too late.

222
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:19,668
Come in.

223
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:26,486
- Hello, Dave.
- Sir.

224
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,611
- What's the trouble now?
- It's sayers again, I'm afraid, sir.

225
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:30,685
Sayers?

226
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:34,027
That man's beginning to haunt me.
What's wrong with him?

227
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:36,569
Well, he's a good officer, sir,
and his record of arrests

228
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:39,111
is better than anyone we've had
on the squad for years.

229
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:41,444
Yes, that's all very well.

230
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,152
Fellow seems to have
no sense of discretion.

231
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:46,527
All right. What is it this time?

232
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,551
The letter, sir.

233
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:59,569
- Morning, Bob.
- Morning, guv.

234
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:01,819
- Who's this?
- Replacement for jock.

235
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:05,027
The name's hood, sir. I'd like to say
how glad I am to be in your squad, sir.

236
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:08,944
You must be mad! Well, what's
the first disaster on the agenda, Bob?

237
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,152
Nothing like that today. “What?

238
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,652
No writs from indignant villains,

239
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:16,777
stating that by arresting them
while beating up some poor old cripple,

240
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,152
I was unlawfully invading their privacy?

241
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:21,652
You surprise me, sergeant,
you surprise me muchly.

242
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:24,736
Message book, nothing for us there.

243
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Well, who knows?

244
00:17:27,843 --> 00:17:31,236
We may yet see the day clear for
some good old-fashioned police work.

245
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,402
You're in a very good mood today.

246
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:35,777
I'm always in a good mood
when it seems possible

247
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,277
I'll get a minute or two away
from paperwork.

248
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:42,944
Knock off a few tearaways, Bob,
you know that.

249
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:43,968
Hello.

250
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,944
Right, sir, I'll tell him.

251
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,236
The assistant commission of crime
wants to see you, sir.

252
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,940
Immediately.

253
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:53,468
Oh?

254
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:58,361
Well, what do you think, constable?
Should I go?

255
00:17:58,385 --> 00:17:59,885
Well, I...

256
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:03,319
You planning to stay with us long?

257
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:06,027
Or is it an early retirement for you
and a book of reminiscences,

258
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,027
telling how you solved
all my best cases?

259
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:09,902
- Well, it's, er...
- Hostile witness, Bob.

260
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:15,569
Only one thing for it,
get out the old rubber truncheon.

261
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:17,527
Blimey! What's up with him?

262
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:19,486
Cirrhosis of the heart, constable.

263
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,736
Comes from loving your job
and an overindulgence in duty.

264
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,652
Don't worry, you'll never suffer from it.

265
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:25,876
Come in.

266
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:32,951
Oh, sayers.

267
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,361
Sit down.

268
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,260
Thank you, sir.

269
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:38,527
Gunter's solicitors have
complained that you

270
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,652
broke into his premises
without a warrant, is that true?

271
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,486
I'm afraid it is, sir.

272
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,027
Well, they've been in touch
with a member of parliament,

273
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:48,069
and now we've got
the home office on our tails.

274
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,402
Well, what are they getting
so fussed about?

275
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:52,694
We found the jewels there, didn't we?

276
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:56,027
That, I Grant you, goes a long way
in mitigation, sayers.

277
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,069
But why take these risks?

278
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:01,152
If you'd guessed wrong, you'd have been
for the high jump after last time.

279
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:05,236
Well, we weren't guessing. We had
definite information the gear was there.

280
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,319
Then why didn't you take out
a warrant in the proper manner?

281
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:10,444
Well, it was midnight when I got the tip.

282
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,569
I couldn't find a magistrate at the hour.

283
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:15,402
I knew if we waited till morning the stuff
would all have been out of the country.

284
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,569
It's still unlawful entry.

285
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:19,819
Now, please try and
look at it from my side.

286
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:23,486
The detective complement is woefully
undermanned as you know.

287
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,986
An officer with your experience
is too valuable to lose,

288
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,361
even for the sake of a fence
of gunter's calibre.

289
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,402
Well, he's due for pd,

290
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:35,152
that should relieve the pressure on the
detective force for the next few years.

291
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:38,736
All I'm saying, sayers,
is play it reasonable.

292
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,069
For you own sake and for mine.

293
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,652
Well now, let's see where we stand.

294
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:47,319
What happened at that club last night?

295
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:50,902
Oh, the usual thing,
the owner wouldn't pay protection.

296
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:52,319
Can you make a charge?

297
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:54,736
Afraid not, sir,
the owner won't cooperate.

298
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Oh.

299
00:19:56,718 --> 00:19:59,069
What about all these newspaper stories?

300
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:02,444
Is this protection game really spreading?

301
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,319
Well, at the moment, sir, they're working
in much too small groups

302
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:07,277
to be a major threat.

303
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,069
But if they ever get properly organised,

304
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:13,069
then we've really got to start worrying
about the shortage of manpower.

305
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:19,027
Wally never had a fiver
in his life, even a forged one!

306
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,652
So this old girl picks him up in great
windmill street, but he was green...

307
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:26,236
- Hang on a moment, hang on.
- And all they could do him for was suss!

308
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,611
Yeah, I went caso with this brass and
do you know who she turned out to be?

309
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:33,319
- Hello, Alfie boy!
- Harry. What's all this about then?

310
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,402
You won't be wasting your time,
I promise you that.

311
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:38,819
You know everybody. Help yourself
to a drink, I won't be half a jiff.

312
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:41,236
- Go on, look who's here!
- Hello, Alfie.

313
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,694
- What's all the lettuce for then?
- Give it a bit of atmosphere.

314
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:46,319
Well, they're all here.

315
00:20:46,343 --> 00:20:48,736
The points to stress
are the increased turnover

316
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,027
- and the overseas' outlets for profits.
- Right.

317
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,277
- Only don't mention my name, remember?
- Oh, sure.

318
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:55,527
- You don't want to be seen either, do you?
- No.

319
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:59,527
- But I would like to hear what they say.
- Oh, that's easy.

320
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,027
There we are. I'll see you later.

321
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,777
And, Harry... yes?

322
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:06,861
- The job of your life?
- Leave it to me.

323
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:09,319
I ought to kill you, you know that?

324
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:12,194
At least I'd die happy?

325
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:14,486
All right, boys, right.
Now, make yourselves comfortable

326
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,069
and I'll tell you what this
is all in aid of.

327
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:20,611
Well, if that's the case, alf,
what's you objection?

328
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:23,611
How do I know the other mobs
will play it straight?

329
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:26,069
As I said, it's in the common interests.

330
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:30,736
Now look, the scheme covers everything.
Central information, unified command.

331
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,361
A pool of reserves ready to beat the hell
out of anyone trying to muscle in.

332
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:37,736
And I've got the backing
of a very, very influential party.

333
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,277
Someone you all know.

334
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:42,777
Well, by reputation, anyway,
but who I, obviously, can't name.

335
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,611
If we go in together,
we've got a right to know.

336
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,527
Now, believe me,
this is man is big, really big.

337
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:50,527
- You got nothing to worry about there.
- Let it ride, alf.

338
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:54,986
- He can't say, you know that.
- Yeah, sure.

339
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,611
What territory have you given me again?

340
00:21:57,635 --> 00:22:00,402
We've all got roughly the same area
as we operate on as it is.

341
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:03,361
But you know as well as I do, there's
always young Teds and tearaways

342
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:05,402
ready to make a name for themselves
on any manor.

343
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:08,777
Now, this way, once we've agreed
who's top man in that section,

344
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,902
all the rest of us help him
put the block on any invaders.

345
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:14,319
We all work to support each other.

346
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:18,486
Let's cut the cackle. It's a natural.

347
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,111
Well, I'm in for a start.

348
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:22,815
Anybody else?

349
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,940
I'm with you.

350
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,694
All right, count me in.

351
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:30,218
I'm with you, Harry.

352
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:36,527
Well, Alfie, how about you?

353
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,527
I like the idea of a syndicate all right.

354
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:41,486
- But who runs it?
- I do, but out in the open.

355
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,319
We'll have meetings every month.
You can see the books any time you like.

356
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,611
And all decisions are subject
to a majority vote.

357
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:49,111
- Fair enough?
- Fair enough!

358
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,277
- Only fair, Harry.
- Come on, Alfie.

359
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,944
What are we risking?
Ten per cent of our take.

360
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,611
And if you don't like what I'm doing,

361
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,611
you can swing the vote against me
and change the policy.

362
00:22:57,635 --> 00:22:59,694
Well, that's democracy, boys.

363
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:02,069
Oh, come on, let's not waste
any more time.

364
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:05,902
I just like to know what
I'm getting into, that's all.

365
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,444
All right, you got me.

366
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:10,694
Right then, that's the lot.

367
00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:12,861
Right, we start operating as from now

368
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:15,194
and the first board meeting
will be in four weeks from today.

369
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:16,277
- Right?
- Right.

370
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,569
Right, get stuck into the drinks, boys.
Enjoy yourselves.

371
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,402
Looks like we're on
a winner here, boy.

372
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,986
That's the general idea. You got
nothing to worry about I promise you that.

373
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,361
Well, you know me.
I don't like to do anything blind.

374
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:26,569
See you in a month then?

375
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:33,527
I'll be on blower long before that.
We got get the details ironed out.

376
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:35,902
Straight down, will you, on the way out?
All right, see you later.

377
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:38,361
Well, did you hear that?

378
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:41,194
I didn't know you had a such
a command of language.

379
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,986
Alfie Peters looked like being a bit dodgy
out there for a bit, you know.

380
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,194
He could have swayed them
if he'd been allowed to.

381
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,777
They are businessmen.
They can see the advantages.

382
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:53,652
Yeah, it was touch and go. I had to work
on them, you know, Waldo... mr zhernikov.

383
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:59,611
If it's strain, Waldo will do
now that we are partners.

384
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:01,944
One thing, we've got to
keep out of the news.

385
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:04,986
No more of this strong-arm stuff,
except as a last resort.

386
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,569
That's gonna be a bit tricky. Some
of these boys are lively with the cosh.

387
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:10,902
They can be taught.
Who controls them on the job?

388
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:12,606
Tanky Thomas.

389
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,585
No good.

390
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,819
We need someone with more finesse,
tough but intelligent.

391
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:22,402
- That's a tall order in this game.
- Recruit from outside then.

392
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:26,111
Bend a straight man a little,
if necessary.

393
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,777
I've got the very merchant.

394
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:28,801
Tough?

395
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,135
Very.

396
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,777
But not violent?

397
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:35,194
Oh, not violent at all.

398
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:38,218
Except when he has to be.

399
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:45,611
Pretty good. We'll add a stronger sweep
with the right leg this time, OK?

400
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:49,777
- Do you want to go on?
- No. No, thanks, Ollie.

401
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:52,777
No, Wally's seeing the specialist today
and I want to get back there.

402
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:55,236
- I want to hear the verdict.
- Do you think he'll be OK?

403
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,694
Oh, yeah, just takes a bit of time.
See you Tuesday.

404
00:24:57,718 --> 00:24:59,593
So long, paddy.

405
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:10,861
Hands together. That's right.

406
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,861
Right underneath the chin, OK? Once more.

407
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,652
- Hi, salty.
- Hi, Sadie.

408
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:16,611
- Is he here?
- Yes, in the shower.

409
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:19,027
Now, where were we?

410
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,801
Pay attention.

411
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:24,093
Hi!

412
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:27,819
I said hi!

413
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:29,718
Hi! Come on in.

414
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,236
- Are you decent?
- Only when I have to be.

415
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Oh!

416
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:36,176
Oh!

417
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,736
- What time are you working?
- I've got to be in at nine for rehearsal.

418
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,194
Where we going?

419
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:43,902
I want to be there when Wally gets back.
Do you mind?

420
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:45,426
How is he?

421
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,676
I don't know yet.

422
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,835
Ask him.

423
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,010
Paddy?

424
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:10,398
He's inside.

425
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:13,176
No, you stay here.

426
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:18,444
- Hello, paddy.
- Hello, Harry boy.

427
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:20,611
Don't tell me you come down here
to take weight off.

428
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:22,444
The customers like you just as you are.

429
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:25,027
Well, if that's true, why are taking away
my second number?

430
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,194
It's nothing personal. I've just got
a new girl I wanna try out, that's all.

431
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:29,944
You got a minute?

432
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:30,968
Sure.

433
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:34,986
I'll wait for you in the car, paddy.

434
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,319
Wally be back on the job soon?

435
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:39,236
- I'm hearing tonight.
- Good.

436
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,944
How'd you like to branch out,
try something new?

437
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:44,868
- Like what?
- Insurance.

438
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:53,069
Thanks all the same but I've never been
one for carving up barmaids with a chiv.

439
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:56,813
One of your pals is in with us.

440
00:26:56,926 --> 00:26:58,606
Alfie Peters.

441
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,777
- But he's got a team of his own.
- All the mobs are coming in with me.

442
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:04,486
Then you must have a silver tongue,
knowing that lot.

443
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,861
Well, they're not fools. They can
see the advantage. How about you?

444
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:11,527
- Sorry, it's not my poison.
- Now, don't jump to conclusions.

445
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,902
The rough stuff is out.
We're after a new style of operator.

446
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:18,006
I appreciate the offer, Harry boy.

447
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:22,152
But I'm a climber. That's all I know,
that's all I want to know.

448
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:27,611
Besides, there's Wally. We don't
go for that sort of stuff and you know it.

449
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:29,944
My offer was to you, not Wally.

450
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:33,611
- We're a team, you know that.
- He broke his hip, didn't he?

451
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,315
It's healing.

452
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,694
He'll be in business again within weeks.
Anyway, thanks for the offer.

453
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:42,319
- Remember, if you change your mind...
- I'll remember.

454
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:43,843
Goodnight.

455
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:55,843
- No sale, guv?
- Not yet.

456
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:00,641
But he doesn't know what I know.

457
00:28:05,926 --> 00:28:08,944
- But for how long?
- I told you, for the rest of my life!

458
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:10,986
- Why didn't they say all this before?
- Look...

459
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,861
While there was a chance of it healing
properly, he didn't want to upset me.

460
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:16,819
Well, I don't believe it.

461
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,569
We'll see another quack.
We'll get the best.

462
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,319
You'll see, you'll be
back on your pins in no time.

463
00:28:20,343 --> 00:28:22,944
Kid, kid, it's no good.
Look, he showed me the x-rays.

464
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,402
The fall twisted something.
Anyway, it's hopeless.

465
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,777
Look, look, get me a drink, will you?

466
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:29,926
And make it neat.

467
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:38,069
- Well, I think it was my fault.
- Shut up!

468
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,194
- Well, how can I forget?
- Shut up!!

469
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,111
It's over. Look, you'd have done the same
for me, so there's an end of it.

470
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:47,069
What a turn up. What a lousy turn up!

471
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,093
Here.

472
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:49,893
Well...

473
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:54,236
I suppose I'll have to start thinking
of a way of earning my living now.

474
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,569
Well, what's the matter with you?
We're partners, aren't we?

475
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,444
I can make enough for the both of us.

476
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:01,902
Look, I don't fancy myself
as a pensioner, boy.

477
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:03,444
You always planned the jobs, didn't you?

478
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:05,319
Well, we'll carry on the same way,
splitting down the middle.

479
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,277
- It wouldn't work.
- Of course it would!

480
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:14,111
Leave me alone, will you, paddy?
I've got things to think about?

481
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,652
Shall I put the bottle by you?

482
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:19,652
I may be a cripple, boy,
but I'm not a corpse.

483
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,986
The day I'm too far gone
to reach for my own liquor

484
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,610
is the day you can start thinking
of buying me a wreath.

485
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:45,652
Why did it have to be him?

486
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,986
At least he can get about.

487
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,027
That's something to be grateful for.

488
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:53,902
Get about? I've seen that man go up
the side of a house like a ladder.

489
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:56,402
- And it's my fault.
- No, paddy, no.

490
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,902
You did everything you could.
You got him away.

491
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:02,166
Yes! And I'm walking about.

492
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,218
And look at him.

493
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,001
Come on.

494
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:08,236
I don't have to be in yet.

495
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,652
There's something
I've got to see Harry about.

496
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:11,676
Paddy!

497
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,027
You're not going to get mixed up
in that business of his?

498
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:15,861
I've got to get Wally the comforts,
haven't I?

499
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:22,365
Where else can I pick up
that kind of money in a hurry?

500
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,885
Come on, come on.

501
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:28,902
You might tell foulcher if I'm gonna pay
for protection, I expect to get it.

502
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:30,486
What's that supposed to mean?

503
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,361
Some young yobos have been hanging
about here recently, dropping hints.

504
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:37,111
- You know their names?
- One of them's called sid something.

505
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,260
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

506
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:45,444
- We'll look after it.
- You'd better, I'm paying enough!

507
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,218
Come on, nero.

508
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:49,236
Hey, Mario, Mario!
What's the matter? These oranges are bad.

509
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Hello?

510
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:52,444
Senor sanchetti, for you.

511
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:55,093
All right! All right!

512
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:01,236
Hello, sanchetti speaking.

513
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,277
I represent the mutual protection
insurance company.

514
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,694
I spoke to you last week.

515
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:09,236
I told you then,
I've got a policy already.

516
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,736
No, not the kind I'm offering.
Those drunks who broke your window...

517
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,277
For example.

518
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:17,027
We specialise in that kind of hazard.

519
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:18,902
It's covered already.

520
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:22,944
How about non-payment of bills,
damage from fights?

521
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:26,486
I told you, I don't want
nothing like that.

522
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,277
I've got no trouble at my place.

523
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:32,261
Not yet, sanchetti, but you will.

524
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,510
Think it over.

525
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,135
How about that?

526
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Now?

527
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:04,193
Oh, dear!

528
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:08,736
'Ere, whose bint
do you think you're groping!

529
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,861
Oh, yes, you did!

530
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:13,861
- You dirty great baboon!
- She don't know what she's talking about!

531
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:16,069
You touch her again,
I'll carve your ears off!

532
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:17,819
You will, will you?

533
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:19,523
Go on, nero!

534
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:23,801
Oh, mamma mial

535
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:27,736
such a thing never happened before.

536
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Never!

537
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:30,902
Such a lot of rough people
about these days.

538
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,527
Is very nice of you
to say so, sir, but not here.

539
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:35,777
Never before!

540
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:39,402
Once doesn't matter, sanchetti,
but if it happened every night,

541
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,986
think how that could affect business.

542
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,730
Come on! Go on, nero! Slug him!

543
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:50,027
- You are the man on the phone.
- Himself.

544
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:52,801
Go on, nero, slug him!

545
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:56,301
Go on, nero! Hit him!

546
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:58,843
You lousy big ape!

547
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:02,944
What are you doing?
You're ruining my business!

548
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:04,318
I'll pay!

549
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:08,793
Please stop them. Please stop them!

550
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:13,193
Come on, you two, break it up!

551
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:16,527
No lady's worth spoiling your dinner for.

552
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:21,777
Now, why don't you shake hands and let the
good people enjoy their dinner in peace?

553
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:25,069
You know, sanchetti,
the chow isn't at all bad here.

554
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:27,319
If only you had a better
class of customer,

555
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:29,152
this would be quite the place.

556
00:34:29,176 --> 00:34:30,526
How much?

557
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:34,569
Our representatives will call on you
tomorrow and discuss terms.

558
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:35,793
Come on.

559
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:41,051
Goodnight.

560
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,194
Is that for me?

561
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:04,218
Harry.

562
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:07,069
- Who's the new thrush.
- A frenchie.

563
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:10,277
- I must promote the entente cordiale.
- I didn't know you spoke the lingo.

564
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:14,194
I've got a pen pal in the foreign legion.

565
00:35:14,218 --> 00:35:16,277
- OK, Anya, that's fine.
- Thank you.

566
00:35:16,301 --> 00:35:17,981
Sadie, girls.

567
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:20,885
All up here, please.

568
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,986
Bonjour tristesse and vive la France.

569
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,069
My parents were Russian.

570
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:28,694
"Khrushchev for king"
is another of my pet phrases.

571
00:35:28,718 --> 00:35:30,152
White Russian.

572
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,361
All right, I'm colour blind.

573
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:35,277
Where do you think
we ought to take it from now?

574
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,486
From the reprise.

575
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,819
- You think you'll like it here?
- If they like me.

576
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:41,777
- Oh, they will.
- How can you be sure?

577
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:45,236
You've got the sort of talent
that they appreciate.

578
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Anya!

579
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:47,944
Can we try it together?

580
00:35:47,968 --> 00:35:55,288
- Excuse me, please, I must go.
- Oh, there'll be other times.

581
00:35:58,676 --> 00:36:00,801
Thank you, Eddie.

582
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,069
- All right, get after them.
- Right.

583
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,652
How many stops is that?

584
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:49,676
Today?

585
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:52,676
Oh, let's see...

586
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,111
Four restaurants, five pubs,

587
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:59,194
three coffee bars, two delicatessens.

588
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,718
Busy boys.

589
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:03,611
Who collects the squeeze,
apart from those two?

590
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,819
Tanky Thomas, generally. When?

591
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:08,236
Fridays. They're getting really organised.

592
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
Yeah.

593
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:12,402
They've still no idea who the big boy
behind foulcher is?

594
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:14,076
Not a clue.

595
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:17,486
Now, what would a straight
up-and-down villain like Damion

596
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,319
be getting mixed up with
a mucky racket like this for?

597
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:21,569
Money, I suppose.

598
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:23,861
He did all right out of
that climbing act of his.

599
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:27,194
We haven't nicked him at it
for five years.

600
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:29,319
Is Wally Smith in on this?

601
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:32,611
The divisional boys say
that fall crippled him for life.

602
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:35,444
Paddy never worked without him,
perhaps that accounts for it.

603
00:37:35,468 --> 00:37:39,152
- Do you want to Nick him?
- No, it's early days yet.

604
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:45,944
First, I think we'll go and exchange
a little saliva with senor sanchetti.

605
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:48,027
You know what?
Klipi¢I for number three.

606
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:49,051
Si.

607
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:53,569
Mr sayers! And how are you?

608
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:55,152
Business good, sanchetti?

609
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:59,027
Oh, nothing to grumble about, mr sayers,
nothing to grumble about.

610
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:01,319
You heard of a boy called paddy Damion?

611
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:02,393
Damion?

612
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,986
No, I never.

613
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,402
Six foot one, well-built,
black hair, brown eyes?

614
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:10,944
Wearing a camel-hair overcoat?

615
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:12,902
No, I... I never seen him.

616
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:16,361
- Sorry.
- That's funny, he just walked out of here.

617
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:18,277
Oh, you know how it is, mr sayers?

618
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:21,486
We get so many people in here,
it's impossible to remember them all.

619
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,069
They eat-er their food,
they pay their bill, they go hay-way.

620
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,361
Well, this one
didn't eat-er, didn't get a bill-er

621
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:29,985
and you pay him to go hay-way.

622
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:33,735
I don't know what-er you mean?

623
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,652
Are you a British citizen, sanchetti?

624
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:41,027
I have permit residence since 20 years!

625
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:43,277
You qualify for national health then.

626
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,361
If you take my advice,
you'll see a doctor.

627
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:48,819
You got a severe dose of amnesia
in the pre-frontal lobes,

628
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:55,083
coupled with a chronic flutter
of the lower patellas.

629
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,861
- You ready to see foulcher now?
- Oh, not yet, Bob.

630
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:06,694
I think I'll go back to the office and
gloat on the terror I strike into people.

631
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:09,194
You certainly shook that one all right.

632
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:13,569
By the way, what's chronic flutter
of the lower patellas?

633
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:16,277
In copper's english, it means
he's a yellow-bellied bastard

634
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,801
and his knees knock.

635
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:36,402
j I laughed at love
no you to prove me wrong

636
00:39:36,426 --> 00:39:38,902
j the moon in June and love in bloom

637
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:41,402
j was silly fairy tales

638
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:43,861
j' a precious lot of tummy rot

639
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,569
j for crazy, mixed-up females

640
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:51,361
j I laughed at love
and now it's all so late

641
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:55,736
j to find I need
the things I used to hate... j

642
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,777
- so long, sport.
- Oh, have a drink.

643
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,319
No, not tonight.

644
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:02,736
- No, one of the kids is sick.
- Oh, another time then.

645
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,611
Yeah. Yes, you, me and Wally ought to
go out on a booze-up one of these nights.

646
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:09,194
- Revive old memories.
- Oh, whenever you're free then.

647
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:11,069
He can get round on them
sticks of his, can't he?

648
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:13,486
Oh, he bounds about
like a trampoline artist.

649
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,861
Bit of bad that business. Yeah.

650
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:18,152
Well, good to have you in the team, boy.
Look after yourself.

651
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,444
- Hope the kid gets better.
- Thanks.

652
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:21,861
- See ya.
- Bye.

653
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,361
j sophisticated, slick

654
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,635
j I thought I knew

655
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:36,694
j each move, each lovesick trick

656
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:41,777
j now all I care for is to share your arms
somewhere, somehow

657
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:44,486
j I laughed at love but I'm not

658
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,260
j laughing now

659
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,885
j I laughed at love

660
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,569
- & but I'm not...
- So long, Harry.

661
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:55,986
See you, lippy.

662
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:14,343
They like her.

663
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:18,611
Have I ever recommended anything
but a guilt-edged investment?

664
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:20,277
How did they react?

665
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,944
How would you think with
a take quadrupled in a month?

666
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:25,819
- And Peters?
- Like a kid with his first cosh.

667
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:28,736
Well, bung-as the coppers say.

668
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,635
Who's that man?

669
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:33,718
Paddy Damion, remember?

670
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:37,527
- Interesting face.
- He's a good boy, paddy.

671
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,194
Gonna keep his mouth?

672
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:41,111
He used to be the best cat burglar
in the business.

673
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:45,194
You don't get far in that lark
with verbal diarrhoea.

674
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:48,111
Bring him to my place,
tomorrow at six.

675
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:49,777
Is that wise?

676
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:54,194
I've been thinking. Now that
we've got a little empire going...

677
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:57,944
- We ought to start showing the flag.
- Well, what does that mean?

678
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,777
I'll tell you tomorrow.

679
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,902
You going? What about Anya?

680
00:42:03,926 --> 00:42:06,277
She came all the way
from Algiers on her own.

681
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:09,111
She should be able to find her
way back to hampstead tonight.

682
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:12,986
Besides, I think she's got company.

683
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,010
And so have I. Excuse me.

684
00:42:17,676 --> 00:42:23,196
- Didn't I tell you?
- Oh, they were very kind.

685
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:26,968
- Skol!
- Skol!

686
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:32,861
Thank you for the stockings and the note.

687
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,527
Well, the spelling may have
been a bit rough but, er,

688
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:39,486
- the sentiments were from the heart.
- Ihoped that.

689
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,444
Are you feeling strong?

690
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:42,668
Oh, yes.

691
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:24,444
Oh, thank you. I enjoyed that.

692
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,527
Let's do something tomorrow.

693
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:29,027
- That would be very pleasant.
- I know what!

694
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:30,051
Anya!

695
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:32,319
Anya, come here
and meet a friend of mine.

696
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,611
- Well, excuse me.
- See you at dinner time tomorrow.

697
00:43:35,635 --> 00:43:37,402
But you don't know where I live.

698
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:39,694
You give your address
to Jim the head waiter.

699
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:45,718
- One o'clock then.
- I shall look forward to that.

700
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:53,111
- Anya, this is lord buncholme.
- Home.

701
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:57,236
- Oh, hello. How do you do?
- How do you do? Do sit down.

702
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,910
Hello then.

703
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:04,027
- Enjoying yourself?
- She seems a sweet kid.

704
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:07,027
I'd feel more warmth
if she hadn't stolen my number.

705
00:44:07,051 --> 00:44:10,527
- Well, you can hardly blame her for that.
- Try me.

706
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:12,194
Now why the black mood?

707
00:44:12,218 --> 00:44:17,819
- Just because I danced with her?
- So that's what you were doing?

708
00:44:17,843 --> 00:44:19,861
You don't think I fancy her, do you?

709
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:23,027
Oh! The thought never crossed my mind.

710
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:24,152
Too skinny.

711
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:26,444
Paddy, you certainly had me fooled.

712
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:28,843
All right, drop it!

713
00:44:29,135 --> 00:44:32,777
Now, come on, take off that shroud.
We're going on a mystery tour.

714
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:35,902
- Where to?
- There's only one way to find out.

715
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,986
Come on, let's get the coats.

716
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,402
- Goodnight, Jim!
- Goodnight, Jim!

717
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,069
Goodnight, Sadie. Paddy.

718
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:46,053
The French bit left this for you.

719
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:04,027
- Good afternoon, miss bergolin.
- Is mr zhernikov in?

720
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,111
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

721
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:08,986
But we're under way.
The contracts have all been signed.

722
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,152
We've been working on
the building for a month now.

723
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:12,819
You've got
a tight schedule, mr wingrove.

724
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:16,069
In my opinion, you'll be extremely lucky
to complete on time.

725
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:20,736
And look at that penalty clause
if you overrun. £2,000 a week.

726
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,885
We won't overrun.

727
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:25,343
Yes, miss rush?

728
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:27,694
Miss bergolin is here.

729
00:45:27,718 --> 00:45:29,218
Thank you.

730
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:43,527
You had a great triumph, my darling.
Congratulations.

731
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,652
- I looked for you afterwards.
- Did you? I had an appointment.

732
00:45:46,676 --> 00:45:48,444
But I spoke to Harry. He was very pleased.

733
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:50,319
He's going to book me
for the run of the show.

734
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:52,694
Marvellous. What about the permit?

735
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:54,569
- He's getting it extended.
- Good.

736
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:57,694
So now my little Anya is
really launched on her career.

737
00:45:57,718 --> 00:45:59,468
Thanks to you.

738
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:05,444
Tell me, dancing with the customers,
is that also part of your duties?

739
00:46:05,468 --> 00:46:07,361
Only if I want to.

740
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:11,194
And you wanted to with
young mr Damion?

741
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,777
He sent me stockings to wish me luck.

742
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,402
Do you find him, er... interesting?

743
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:20,861
He's not unattractive for an englishman.

744
00:46:20,885 --> 00:46:23,861
But not as interesting as you, Waldo.

745
00:46:23,885 --> 00:46:25,444
Oh, please, darling.

746
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:28,694
You know I don't regard you
as my sole property.

747
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:31,069
Does he have an occupation?

748
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:34,111
He's a partner of mr foulcher, I think.

749
00:46:34,135 --> 00:46:36,819
I see him in the club all the time.

750
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:39,569
You're not jealous, are you, Waldo?

751
00:46:39,593 --> 00:46:41,569
Oh, madly, madly, but, er...

752
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:43,736
I also happen to be doing
a little business with Harry

753
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,236
and this boy is involved. It would be
convenient to know something about him.

754
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,260
Oh?

755
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,652
It would be a pleasure.

756
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,777
There's no call for an excess of zeal,
you understand?

757
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:58,051
Just a friendship.

758
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:01,444
Come on, come on, come on.

759
00:47:01,468 --> 00:47:03,486
What's all the rush?
I'm sweating like a pig!

760
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,319
He gets very upset if you're late.

761
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:07,486
- I could do with a drink.
- You won't get one here.

762
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,069
He hasn't bought a round for 20 years.

763
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,486
- What do I call him?
- Well, he's Waldo to me.

764
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,527
- But you'd better call him mr zhernikov.
- Mr which-a-cough?

765
00:47:15,551 --> 00:47:17,402
Never mind, just mumble something
and watch your language.

766
00:47:17,426 --> 00:47:20,944
This isn't the local spieler, you know.

767
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:23,069
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, mr foulcher.

768
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,652
- Mr zhernikov, please.
- Will you come in?

769
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,176
Thank you.

770
00:47:27,676 --> 00:47:30,777
This way, my dear,
I've got some visitors coming.

771
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:33,111
Miss rush will show you out and, er...

772
00:47:33,135 --> 00:47:35,777
Let me know how you get on
with our young friend.

773
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:36,851
I will.

774
00:47:38,176 --> 00:47:39,826
Bye, Waldo.

775
00:47:42,635 --> 00:47:43,835
Come in.

776
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,444
Mr foulcher and mr Damion, sir.

777
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:50,652
Hello, Waldo. Good to see you.

778
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:52,694
Your promptness is a lesson to us all.

779
00:47:52,718 --> 00:47:54,569
Well, you know what I'm like
about business, Waldo.

780
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:56,902
By the way, this is paddy Damion.

781
00:47:56,926 --> 00:48:01,111
- Please to meet you.
- Oh, yes, I've heard about you.

782
00:48:01,135 --> 00:48:03,819
Are you interested in medieval armour,
mr Damion?

783
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:05,319
I don't know very much about it.

784
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:09,902
I spent a lifetime collecting
some of these, er, gadgets.

785
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:13,152
This was probably used in
the tower of London, about 1600.

786
00:48:13,176 --> 00:48:15,551
It's a thumb screw.

787
00:48:16,218 --> 00:48:20,694
Feel the work in this.
They were craftsmen in those days.

788
00:48:20,718 --> 00:48:24,438
- Marvellous!
- Can you lift it?

789
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:27,319
He's a strong boy, this one.

790
00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:29,527
I shouldn't like to do it for long.

791
00:48:29,551 --> 00:48:31,944
They used to fight all day with that on.

792
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:33,944
They must have sw...

793
00:48:33,968 --> 00:48:36,843
Perspired like... fury.

794
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:41,111
You suffer from the taint of gentility,
mr Damion.

795
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:43,635
The word is "sweat".

796
00:48:51,218 --> 00:48:53,694
Now, do you know what
I called you here for?

797
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:57,902
- Yes.
- Harry said something about a development.

798
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:02,486
Gentlemen, I look upon your activities
as my little hobby enterprise.

799
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,986
Sit down. And I've been given it
some very careful thought.

800
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,069
The basic machine we have created
is running smoothly.

801
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,361
Profits are both regular
and satisfactory.

802
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:15,069
But we have come to a crossroads.

803
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:18,861
So what do we do now, mr Damion?

804
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:21,027
Oh, I'm sure you can tell us.

805
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:22,101
Expand.

806
00:49:22,718 --> 00:49:26,652
That's what I would advise a client
and that's what I would advise for us.

807
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:29,152
We've about scooped the platter clean
in my area, Waldo.

808
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:30,444
We can't squeeze 'em much more.

809
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:36,194
No, I think Mr... Means
expand in a different direction.

810
00:49:36,218 --> 00:49:37,418
Exactly.

811
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,652
Consider how we stand?

812
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,777
We now make an average of £15 a week
per unit establishment.

813
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:47,152
It's not a great deal, but the merit lies
in regularity and in quantity.

814
00:49:47,176 --> 00:49:49,736
Now, what I propose is...

815
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,527
Much larger sums,

816
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:53,194
extracted only once,

817
00:49:53,218 --> 00:49:56,777
- from different types of organisation.
- Such as?

818
00:49:56,801 --> 00:50:00,902
This is the plan of an office block
going up in the chiswick area,

819
00:50:00,926 --> 00:50:05,902
built by the wingrove construction company
at a cost of £239,000.

820
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:08,486
Completion date is in four weeks.

821
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,152
They've had some delays, but, er...

822
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:14,736
They can just do it now
if nothing else goes wrong.

823
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,402
If it does...

824
00:50:16,426 --> 00:50:19,986
They have to pay a penalty
of £2,000 a week.

825
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,694
How does this affect us?

826
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,777
It shouldn't be impossible for
mr Damion and his gladiators

827
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:28,361
to delay that completion.

828
00:50:28,385 --> 00:50:31,111
Now, just a minute.
This isn't a delicatessen.

829
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:33,527
It's a big combine,
they're not going to frighten easily.

830
00:50:33,551 --> 00:50:37,944
I happen to know they're in a very
difficult position financially.

831
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,111
They couldn't afford to run
into the penalty period,

832
00:50:40,135 --> 00:50:42,652
what with overage,
bank interest and surcharges.

833
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:46,569
- What do we get out of it?
- Five thousand, I should say.

834
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:48,152
Five grand?

835
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:49,652
In pounds?

836
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:53,111
I told you it was a development.

837
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:55,194
What is the modus operandi?

838
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,902
How do we delay a building project?

839
00:50:57,926 --> 00:51:01,236
There are ways.
It's not as difficult as you think.

840
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,236
The rest of the syndicate,
are they in on this?

841
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,527
- Not at this stage.
- Well, that's a bit dodgy, isn't it?

842
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:10,236
Let's see how it works first.

843
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,361
Because if it does, there's
a whole new world opening up for us,

844
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:15,319
from which they'll all benefit too.

845
00:51:15,343 --> 00:51:18,402
We won't be bothering with single units
any more. We'll go for chain stores,

846
00:51:18,426 --> 00:51:20,236
brewers with hundreds of pubs.

847
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,736
Dry cleaning organisations, cinemas.

848
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,569
Dealing always with
the head offices direct.

849
00:51:25,593 --> 00:51:30,152
Consider how vulnerable a chain of
dry cleaners with 70 branches would be.

850
00:51:30,176 --> 00:51:33,416
Where would we strike next?

851
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:39,268
Neither of you is temperance, I take it?

852
00:51:44,343 --> 00:51:47,152
Do you really think it would work?

853
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:48,176
Work?

854
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:52,861
So confident am I that I'm
going to propose a little toast.

855
00:51:52,885 --> 00:51:56,694
To the Jonathan wingrove
construction company

856
00:51:56,718 --> 00:52:02,236
and to our friend here, who is going to
make them... what is the word, mr Damion?

857
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,260
Sweat.

858
00:52:03,468 --> 00:52:04,668
Exactly.

859
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:25,819
- Well?
- He'll play.

860
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:28,569
You're sure he knows the drill now?
No strike action.

861
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:33,652
- Just accidents and delays.
- He's with it.

862
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:35,986
Good lad. What now?

863
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:42,970
The classic military move, my boy.
Hit the lines of supply.

864
00:52:44,426 --> 00:52:46,652
It's blackmail then?

865
00:52:46,676 --> 00:52:49,652
- There's no doubt about it, sir.
- Well, you're the security officer.

866
00:52:49,676 --> 00:52:51,194
Look at the facts.

867
00:52:51,218 --> 00:52:54,819
This man forecast we'd have two days
clear of accidents and delays.

868
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:56,444
And we did.

869
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:58,194
Then he phoned mr Tyson

870
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:01,152
and he suggested he take out a policy
to cover all these things.

871
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:04,527
And when mr Tyson refused,
it all started up again.

872
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:07,361
They seem to know exactly
where and how to hurt us most.

873
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,152
They've successfully delayed deliveries
of our most vital materials.

874
00:53:10,176 --> 00:53:14,277
Thrown the whole schedule out of balance
and not just haphazardly either.

875
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:15,944
How do we stand for time?

876
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:20,069
We shan't make completion
or anything like it.

877
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:21,361
What about the police?

878
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:25,402
Well, sir, as an ex-yard man myself,
I'd naturally prefer to call them in.

879
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:29,194
But if we're thinking of the firm,
I don't see how it could help us.

880
00:53:29,218 --> 00:53:31,527
There's no effective way
of preventing these incidents

881
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:33,569
without an army of police on the job.

882
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:37,652
And they certainly couldn't spare us that.

883
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:40,111
Is he out there now?

884
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:41,135
Yes.

885
00:53:44,385 --> 00:53:48,825
All right, miss Haywood, show him in.

886
00:53:50,135 --> 00:53:52,652
- Mr Damion, sir.
- Thank you very much.

887
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:58,861
Well, gentlemen, I'm glad to see
you've decided to do the sensible thing.

888
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:00,565
Well, now...

889
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:05,678
Shall we get down to... business?

890
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:28,486
Oh, I think it's a lovely flat!

891
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,069
But you'll have to get rid of that.
It's awful!

892
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:33,611
- Do you think so?
- Bloody horrible! Where'd you get it?

893
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:36,277
- Nero.
- What's she going on about, boy?

894
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:39,277
I'm giving him the benefit of
a woman's advice about furnishing.

895
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:43,402
Oh, watch it, cocker, watch it!
I know her. She's making plans.

896
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:47,069
You can't expect the boy to know. It's the
first time he's had a place of his own.

897
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:50,319
What about the ville? Had a place
of your own then, didn't you, son?

898
00:54:50,343 --> 00:54:52,486
That was until me and Wally
moved in the cell with him.

899
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,069
Oh, leave off, alf!

900
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:59,527
- He asked for my advice and I gave it.
- All right, ducky, all right! No.

901
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:00,551
Paddy!

902
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:02,968
Anya.

903
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:09,188
Hang on, you two, I'll be back.

904
00:55:11,051 --> 00:55:14,531
- Hello, Anya.
- Hello, paddy.

905
00:55:14,926 --> 00:55:16,126
Come in.

906
00:55:16,218 --> 00:55:19,152
- 'Ere are, Wally love, have one of these.
- Thanks, love.

907
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:20,486
Hello, Wally!

908
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:23,260
Oh, gosh, am I pooped.

909
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:26,736
- Did you do the chow by yourself?
- All three tons of it!

910
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,944
Well, these... these rolls are spot on.

911
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:30,968
Stay afterwards?

912
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:35,944
- What about Sadie?
- I'll fix that.

913
00:55:35,968 --> 00:55:37,468
All right.

914
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:40,481
What's that?

915
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:45,611
That's Harry's status symbol.

916
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:48,569
The honourable Clarissa
somebody hyphen something.

917
00:55:48,593 --> 00:55:50,236
She's got a family tree a mile high.

918
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,986
Looks as if she just climbed down from it.

919
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:55,152
- 'Ere, host! We're out of wallop!
- There's a whole crate in the kitchen.

920
00:55:55,176 --> 00:55:58,111
What am I then, the bleedin' Butler?

921
00:55:58,135 --> 00:55:59,819
Don't go away.

922
00:55:59,843 --> 00:56:05,319
Don't hurry, I'll stay and parlez-vous
with the mademoiselle.

923
00:56:05,343 --> 00:56:06,861
You speak French?

924
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:09,694
Well, how's things in south London then?

925
00:56:09,718 --> 00:56:13,694
- Same as always, under control.
- I don't know what it is about alf.

926
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:16,444
Everything I say these days
just seems to stick in his throat.

927
00:56:16,468 --> 00:56:19,444
Come on, we're partners now!

928
00:56:19,468 --> 00:56:21,319
Well, since you brought it up then.

929
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:24,236
What's this I hear about you doing
a building firm on your own?

930
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,277
Don't get anxious. Ten per cent goes
in the kitty, same as any other job.

931
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,986
- Still a right Liberty.
- Wait till you see the figures.

932
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:34,319
That isn't the point. I didn't come into
to the syndicate for a job that size.

933
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:36,861
Oh, you're not in for the money?

934
00:56:36,885 --> 00:56:39,069
You just like the life.

935
00:56:39,093 --> 00:56:41,777
- I bet Sophie doesn't agree with you.
- You keep Sophie out of this!

936
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:45,027
- It's me you're doing business with.
- Right-oh. All right.

937
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:47,444
If you feel so strong about it, you
can say your peace at the next meeting.

938
00:56:47,468 --> 00:56:49,968
Don't think I won't.

939
00:56:50,926 --> 00:56:52,801
All right then.

940
00:56:54,468 --> 00:56:56,343
Clarissa, here.

941
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:07,944
- Someone may come in.
- No, they're mostly gone.

942
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:10,194
All the same, it's too public.

943
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:14,777
You're in my blood and you know it,
you French thing.

944
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:17,402
Sounds if you should see a doctor.

945
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:21,027
The only antidote to what I've got is...
Homeopathic.

946
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:26,811
- What's that?
- The hair of the dog that bit me.

947
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,694
What if your little playmate walked in?

948
00:57:32,718 --> 00:57:35,319
- She could walk right out again.
- She'd hate me.

949
00:57:35,343 --> 00:57:36,944
Oh, and you care?

950
00:57:36,968 --> 00:57:41,111
I don't like to make unnecessary enemies.

951
00:57:41,135 --> 00:57:46,111
Well, how many necessary ones do you have?

952
00:57:46,135 --> 00:57:48,527
You're really serious about
this singing lark, aren't you?

953
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:50,819
Of course! It's my profession.

954
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:51,843
Oh...

955
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,027
- Oh, are you going?
- Bit tired, yeah.

956
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:14,902
Well, I'd run you back
but I can't leave just yet?

957
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:18,194
That's all right. Tanky Thomas
is going right by my place.

958
00:58:18,218 --> 00:58:20,694
- Oh, good.
- Oh, er...

959
00:58:20,718 --> 00:58:22,819
Sadie was looking for you
a few minutes ago.

960
00:58:22,843 --> 00:58:23,843
Oh?

961
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:27,027
- Excuse me, please.
- Don't go yet.

962
00:58:27,051 --> 00:58:28,101
Please.

963
00:58:30,926 --> 00:58:32,986
A right bastard you are!

964
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,736
Look, I'm not married to Sadie.

965
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,527
She worked like a slave
to make this cabbage go.

966
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:41,694
Couldn't you have played up a bit,
at least in front of that mob?

967
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,486
What's come over you, boy? This isn't
the paddy Damion I used to know.

968
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:47,902
Your old friends never see you.
You treat Sadie like a brass.

969
00:58:47,926 --> 00:58:51,986
Oh, this... this kind of living
gone to your head or something?

970
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,236
Leave off.

971
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:57,611
Well, who is this Anya?
What's so special about her?

972
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,152
I don't know.

973
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:01,902
I really don't know!
She's got something on me, that's all.

974
00:59:01,926 --> 00:59:02,926
Yeah.

975
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:05,944
Well, I can't explain it!

976
00:59:05,968 --> 00:59:07,819
Hello, hello, hello!

977
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:09,902
I thought you two was
having a kip in here.

978
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:14,126
- Just coming.
- Well, come on then.

979
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:17,694
Come on, straight home! Avril!

980
00:59:17,718 --> 00:59:19,277
Goodnight, Sadie.

981
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:22,611
- Where's nero?
- He's waiting for you down the car.

982
00:59:22,635 --> 00:59:24,236
You off already?

983
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,885
Already? It's 2:00am.

984
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:29,611
Look, hang on a minute
and I'll run you back.

985
00:59:29,635 --> 00:59:31,694
Thanks, but tanky's taking me.

986
00:59:31,718 --> 00:59:33,902
Goodnight, me old China.
Thanks for the booze-up.

987
00:59:33,926 --> 00:59:35,777
Handsome! Coming, love?

988
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:38,444
Goodnight, Sadie. I'll see you.

989
00:59:38,468 --> 00:59:40,277
Goodnight! And...

990
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:43,152
- Thanks for helping.
- Any time.

991
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:45,819
Weddings, family gatherings and funerals.

992
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:47,736
Catering speciality.

993
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,510
I'll drop by tomorrow.

994
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:51,926
Yeah.

995
01:00:02,885 --> 01:00:05,111
Do you have a pain in your head?

996
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:08,495
No. It's a bit further down.

997
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:41,236
My backers and me feel that the
wingrove operation has set the pattern

998
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,111
for all our future deals.

999
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:46,027
Now, you stand on me, when you
consider that for three weeks' work

1000
01:00:46,051 --> 01:00:50,402
we've pulled in five grand. Five grand!

1001
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:53,319
Well, it makes the normal graft
look pretty sick.

1002
01:00:53,343 --> 01:00:56,527
- Damn right it does!
- How do we pick these new type jobs then?

1003
01:00:56,551 --> 01:00:59,736
Well, we'd have to case them properly,
of course. Now, paddy can handle that.

1004
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,736
Well, what do you think?

1005
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,527
- Well, I'm all for it myself.
- Yeah, me too.

1006
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:06,194
- Count me in.
- Me, too.

1007
01:01:06,218 --> 01:01:07,968
Well, I'm not!

1008
01:01:08,343 --> 01:01:10,194
What sold me on this caper
was the obvious fact

1009
01:01:10,218 --> 01:01:11,861
that it stopped poaching
and looked a right earner.

1010
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:14,777
- That's still true, isn't it?
- Of course, it's true.

1011
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:17,319
So why risk something we know
we can work for this pipe dream?

1012
01:01:17,343 --> 01:01:19,486
Well, that worked too, didn't it?

1013
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,777
Yes, once and what does that prove?

1014
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:23,569
You just think about it.

1015
01:01:23,593 --> 01:01:25,986
So far we've been tackling
one-man businesses.

1016
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,986
Small operators without much pull
who just want to be left in peace.

1017
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:32,069
But the minute we go for the big boys,
we're playing in the first division.

1018
01:01:32,093 --> 01:01:34,319
They've got a stack of the ready,
contacts in parliament,

1019
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:36,444
enough pull all round to bring
the roof down on our heads.

1020
01:01:36,468 --> 01:01:38,819
You're a miserable-minded geezer, alf.

1021
01:01:38,843 --> 01:01:41,152
Why don't you look on
the bright side for a change?

1022
01:01:41,176 --> 01:01:43,777
You ought to get a lot more bird in
before getting cocky with me, son!

1023
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:46,652
Take it easy, take it easy, boy.

1024
01:01:46,676 --> 01:01:47,986
All right.

1025
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,194
Now the first thing he said was that the
syndicate's got to keep out of the news.

1026
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:52,319
That's right.

1027
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:54,986
You think we can crack some of the
top jollies with that strong arm stuff.

1028
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,361
- I'm damned if I...
- You're out of order, alf!

1029
01:01:56,385 --> 01:02:03,236
Just shut up and let somebody else
get a word in edgeways, will you?

1030
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,111
- Anybody here agree with him?
- No!

1031
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:06,819
Right, the meeting goes against you.

1032
01:02:06,843 --> 01:02:09,361
- Then it will have get on without me.
- Now, wait a minute.

1033
01:02:09,385 --> 01:02:12,611
Nobody bows out of this syndicate, alf.
That was established at the beginning.

1034
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:15,027
And who's gonna stop me?

1035
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:21,861
Now, look, we don't want to quarrel
among ourselves, do we?

1036
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:25,027
Come on, alf!
Don't behave like a spoiled kid.

1037
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:27,569
We've got to do this business
in a business-like way.

1038
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:29,527
The vote went against you,
you've got to learn to accept it,

1039
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:32,486
- same as I would if it went against me.
- I don't have to accept nothing!

1040
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:39,230
I joined this voluntary
and I'm getting out the same way.

1041
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:46,486
What's all that about?

1042
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,069
They're potty.

1043
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:51,277
- Stark staring bonkers!
- You're not pulling out, are you?

1044
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:53,277
So will you too if you take my advice.

1045
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:56,402
They're gonna run this racket right into
the ground the way they're going on.

1046
01:02:56,426 --> 01:02:58,551
Come, horse race.

1047
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:00,751
Come on.

1048
01:03:01,885 --> 01:03:03,986
What are we gonna do about him?

1049
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:08,277
He starts up again on his own,
bang goes the truce all round.

1050
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,926
What are we gonna do?

1051
01:03:10,968 --> 01:03:13,361
We've got the organisation, haven't we?

1052
01:03:13,385 --> 01:03:15,819
We've got the resources.

1053
01:03:15,843 --> 01:03:18,861
Well, we'll just buy his boys off, then.

1054
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:23,319
He can't do much unless
he's mob-handed now, can he?

1055
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:26,583
Good, that is! Good, innit?

1056
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:30,111
Right, let's get down to business.

1057
01:03:30,135 --> 01:03:31,815
Now, then...

1058
01:03:53,135 --> 01:03:55,885
What's the grift then?

1059
01:03:56,635 --> 01:03:59,152
They're robbing his team, mr sayers.

1060
01:03:59,176 --> 01:04:04,569
- How many have they got so far?
- About half of them, I'd say.

1061
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:06,343
Anything else?

1062
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:10,402
Otherwise, it's pretty quiet.

1063
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:12,402
Lull before the storm.

1064
01:04:12,426 --> 01:04:14,736
How much is that worth, mr sayers?

1065
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,319
You know the drill, payment by results.

1066
01:04:17,343 --> 01:04:24,183
On my life. Mr sayers,
I'm risking my neck talking to you.

1067
01:04:30,051 --> 01:04:33,361
And don't let this form a precedent.

1068
01:04:33,385 --> 01:04:35,385
Thanks, guv'nor.

1069
01:04:36,926 --> 01:04:38,676
Be seeing you.

1070
01:04:40,801 --> 01:04:43,236
How I despise narks.

1071
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,194
We'd be up the creek in this job
without them.

1072
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:46,568
Oh, sure.

1073
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,861
Looks as if they're getting ready
to move in on Peters' manor.

1074
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:53,736
- Yeah, doing it cleverly though.
- Think he'll make a fight?

1075
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,736
Well, I'll say this, if I know alf Peters,

1076
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,402
he won't be waiting
in any position of prayer.

1077
01:04:59,426 --> 01:05:02,236
- Now, have you got the drill?
- Yeah.

1078
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,861
Now, once more.
We take 'em in groups of three.

1079
01:05:05,885 --> 01:05:08,402
Two of you brummagem boys
will work under an old hand

1080
01:05:08,426 --> 01:05:10,444
until you get to know the town.

1081
01:05:10,468 --> 01:05:13,736
- Now, have you got it?
- Yeah. Right.

1082
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,652
All right, everybody get tooled up.

1083
01:05:15,676 --> 01:05:19,236
We'll show mr Harry bloody foulcher
who's top man on both sides of the river.

1084
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,700
Now, all right, let's get on with it.

1085
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:32,944
- Who's the guv'nor here?
- I am. Why?

1086
01:05:32,968 --> 01:05:35,527
Oh? You are, are you? Yeah.

1087
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:36,551
Right.

1088
01:05:38,385 --> 01:05:40,861
That's to let you know that
I'm taking over from foulcher.

1089
01:05:40,885 --> 01:05:44,485
- You can't do that!
- Can't I?

1090
01:06:15,801 --> 01:06:16,801
Right!

1091
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,986
There were questions in
the house of commons this afternoon

1092
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:18,111
about the flare up of gang violence
in London's west end.

1093
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:21,152
For the government, the home secretary
said the outbreaks had been spasmodic

1094
01:07:21,176 --> 01:07:25,361
and were now completely under control.
There was no cause for undue alarm.

1095
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:27,819
In reply to a question
from mr Geoffrey clitherow,

1096
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:32,236
he denied police powers were inadequate
or that the situation had got out of hand.

1097
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,069
Mr James Wheeler for the opposition
said they were not satisfied

1098
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,152
and would raise the matter again.

1099
01:07:37,176 --> 01:07:39,569
Our parliamentary correspondent
understands that the opposition

1100
01:07:39,593 --> 01:07:42,361
may table a motion censuring
the government.

1101
01:07:42,385 --> 01:07:45,745
And now on a lighter note...

1102
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:49,736
The maniac!
Doesn't he know what he's doing?

1103
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,986
Government action is just
what we must not have.

1104
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:53,652
Don't worry, Waldo.

1105
01:07:53,676 --> 01:07:56,194
They'll put a royal commission on,
that's the last we'll hear of it.

1106
01:07:56,218 --> 01:07:59,402
Well, I'm not that confident.
If Peters keeps making trouble this way,

1107
01:07:59,426 --> 01:08:01,611
they'll have to clamp down
to save their own faces.

1108
01:08:01,635 --> 01:08:03,486
It'll blow over.

1109
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,319
Don't you realise what he's doing?

1110
01:08:05,343 --> 01:08:09,152
Jeopardising a racket that could bring us
in half a million pounds a year.

1111
01:08:09,176 --> 01:08:11,027
Half a million!

1112
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:13,027
You really think it's that bad?

1113
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:15,444
I tell you, when it comes to investments,
I've got a nose for trouble.

1114
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:18,152
We must stop this. Have you talked to him?

1115
01:08:18,176 --> 01:08:22,361
What's the use? He's a pig-headed old fool
when he's got a mind to be.

1116
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:23,944
Can't you buy him off?

1117
01:08:23,968 --> 01:08:25,277
Too late.

1118
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:31,902
Since he brought those yobos down
from Birmingham, he thinks he can win.

1119
01:08:31,926 --> 01:08:36,846
There's only one thing then, isn't there?

1120
01:08:37,468 --> 01:08:40,652
I thought you were against violence.

1121
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,861
I'm against smallpox.

1122
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:45,861
Should that mean I object to vaccination?

1123
01:08:45,885 --> 01:08:46,885
Oh?

1124
01:08:49,218 --> 01:08:51,718
I'm gonna love this.

1125
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:55,593
Harry.

1126
01:08:56,801 --> 01:08:58,451
Box clever.

1127
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,760
Don't I always.

1128
01:09:11,801 --> 01:09:13,486
- Hello?
- Hello.

1129
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:17,527
Hello, son. I'm with, er, you know who,
and we've been thinking.

1130
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:20,402
I'm going to make on last effort
to come to terms with alf.

1131
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:23,027
- Well, that'll please me.
- That's what I thought.

1132
01:09:23,051 --> 01:09:25,319
That's why I rang you.
Can you lay on a meeting?

1133
01:09:25,343 --> 01:09:28,463
Between you and him? Yeah.

1134
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:30,111
And no funny stuff?

1135
01:09:30,135 --> 01:09:32,111
Don't be daft! This is business.

1136
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:34,010
Can you fix it?

1137
01:09:34,843 --> 01:09:37,611
Well, if I tell him it's on the level,
he'll believe me.

1138
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:39,986
Good. Soon as you can then.

1139
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,010
Bye.

1140
01:09:42,718 --> 01:09:43,718
Fixed?

1141
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:46,176
Fixed.

1142
01:09:55,135 --> 01:09:56,635
All right.

1143
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,277
Hello, alf.

1144
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:02,152
Good to see you, boy. On your tod?

1145
01:10:02,176 --> 01:10:04,402
Now, you've known me
a long time, alf, right?

1146
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:05,776
Too true.

1147
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:09,444
Now, don't jump down my throat,
but I've got a message for you.

1148
01:10:09,468 --> 01:10:11,118
From Harry.

1149
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,277
I don't want to hear anything from
that geezer except his death rattle.

1150
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:18,694
No, no, this is on the square.
He just wants to talk to you.

1151
01:10:18,718 --> 01:10:21,652
The time for rabbiting is over.

1152
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:24,819
Look, alf, what have you got to lose
by just seeing him?

1153
01:10:24,843 --> 01:10:29,027
He admits he was hasty. He just wants
a chance to patch things up, that's all.

1154
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:32,736
He says this present ruckus
isn't helping you or the syndicate.

1155
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,120
Come on, alf, give it a try.

1156
01:10:36,426 --> 01:10:40,027
- Is this on the straight, boy?
- I told you.

1157
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:42,926
- Where is he?
- Up top.

1158
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:46,152
Well, you'd better wheel him in,
hadn't you?

1159
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:47,826
Good, good.

1160
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:51,593
Harry?

1161
01:10:58,051 --> 01:10:59,251
Guv'nor.

1162
01:11:02,135 --> 01:11:05,027
Alfie boy, long time no see.

1163
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:07,176
No hard feelings?

1164
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:10,194
No feelings at all.

1165
01:11:10,218 --> 01:11:14,902
You old wolf! Come out of your lair.
It's me, Harry boy!

1166
01:11:14,926 --> 01:11:16,902
Look, what I want to ask you was this.

1167
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:18,819
Is there anywhere private?

1168
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:20,652
- What's in there?
- Changing room.

1169
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,944
Let's get out of the maddening crowd,
shall we?

1170
01:11:22,968 --> 01:11:25,236
You lot stay out here.

1171
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,527
You see, I never pretended
to be right all the way.

1172
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:30,402
- Of course you've got a point of view...
- Light?

1173
01:11:30,426 --> 01:11:33,611
It's just that we've got to expand,
look to the future.

1174
01:11:33,635 --> 01:11:36,819
No more of this shivving and coshing
and general carry on.

1175
01:11:36,843 --> 01:11:40,027
It's only drawing attention to the fact
that we're putting the black on a tour.

1176
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:43,771
Well, you see what I mean, alf?

1177
01:11:57,468 --> 01:11:58,468
Alf?

1178
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:01,486
I didn't know about this, believe me!

1179
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:04,027
Leave him. He didn't know.

1180
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:06,951
Get a doctor, you fools!

1181
01:12:07,676 --> 01:12:09,426
Too late, boy.

1182
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:14,176
What's happening?

1183
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:19,027
- Get out before the cops come.
- No, don't talk.

1184
01:12:19,051 --> 01:12:21,951
Get him for me, get him!

1185
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,652
"Chicago comes to London."

1186
01:12:38,676 --> 01:12:41,819
"Gang fight in soho corral!"

1187
01:12:41,843 --> 01:12:45,694
- Made a real feast day of it.
- I saw them, sir.

1188
01:12:45,718 --> 01:12:49,277
Home office has been on the phone all
morning. Commissioner's over there now.

1189
01:12:49,301 --> 01:12:51,569
Press department's swamped with inquiries.

1190
01:12:51,593 --> 01:12:55,861
And three questions down in the house
already. How far have you got?

1191
01:12:55,885 --> 01:12:59,861
It was Harry foulcher,
paddy Damion and two of the gang.

1192
01:12:59,885 --> 01:13:01,277
Well, where are they now?

1193
01:13:01,301 --> 01:13:03,861
Well, we've got foulcher detained
in west end central.

1194
01:13:03,885 --> 01:13:06,652
- He's denying everything, of course.
- And Damion?

1195
01:13:06,676 --> 01:13:08,026
Damion...

1196
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,444
We've put out a general call for him.

1197
01:13:10,468 --> 01:13:13,527
Well, what about the witnesses,
the other men in the gym and so forth?

1198
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:16,361
We've had them in canon row all morning
but none of them will talk.

1199
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:18,111
Foulcher's men got to them before we did.

1200
01:13:18,135 --> 01:13:21,736
So that's it? How soon
can you make a charge?

1201
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,361
I can't make a case out of nothing, sir.

1202
01:13:24,385 --> 01:13:26,736
You'd be the first on my neck
if it didn't stick.

1203
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,110
Sayers...

1204
01:13:29,426 --> 01:13:32,152
There's grave public concern
over this case.

1205
01:13:32,176 --> 01:13:37,486
Not just because a hoodlum was murdered
but because a gun was used in daylight,

1206
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:40,236
not more than a mile
from piccadilly circus.

1207
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,986
And it comes on the top of
a wave of violence, too.

1208
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:45,111
If we don't act quickly,

1209
01:13:45,135 --> 01:13:47,402
then Peters' men will start to avenge him.

1210
01:13:47,426 --> 01:13:50,611
And then we'll have a full-scale gang war
on our hands.

1211
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,902
With the likelihood that they'll
be using firearms as well.

1212
01:13:52,926 --> 01:13:54,152
Now, we've got to stop that.

1213
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:57,361
If I charge foulcher and his accomplices
without a single witness

1214
01:13:57,385 --> 01:13:59,861
who'll testify to seeing anything,
they're bound to get off.

1215
01:13:59,885 --> 01:14:02,319
Then the word will go about that all
you have to do to beat the law

1216
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,111
is intimidate the withesses.

1217
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:06,736
We'd be laying down nothing
but trouble for ourselves.

1218
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,760
What do you suggest then?

1219
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:13,569
Give me 48 hours, sir.
I've got a line on Damion.

1220
01:14:13,593 --> 01:14:15,736
As Peters was known to be a friend of his,

1221
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,027
I've got a feeling he won't be
too happy about the shooting.

1222
01:14:18,051 --> 01:14:23,152
Now, if that's true, he may just feel
sore enough about it to testify.

1223
01:14:23,176 --> 01:14:24,486
All right.

1224
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:27,277
I'll stall for a couple of days,
but not a minute more.

1225
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:29,194
If Damion hasn't talked by then,

1226
01:14:29,218 --> 01:14:33,402
pick up foulcher again and pull in
as many of the two gangs as you can.

1227
01:14:33,426 --> 01:14:37,569
We've got to prevent an outbreak
of gang warfare whatever the cost!

1228
01:14:37,593 --> 01:14:40,343
Yes, OK. I understand.

1229
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:43,736
How do we stand with
the great white chief?

1230
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,777
- 48 hours.
- Think we can do it?

1231
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:49,319
Well, we've got a chance.
Did you see that... what's her name?

1232
01:14:49,343 --> 01:14:51,736
- Anya bergolin?
- Yeah. Would she play?

1233
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,527
She claimed she had no idea
paddy was a villain.

1234
01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:55,819
- Didn't know where he was, anyway.
- What, straight up?

1235
01:14:55,843 --> 01:15:00,194
I think so. She seemed more worried
about anything affecting her work permit.

1236
01:15:00,218 --> 01:15:01,898
Did she now?

1237
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:05,569
Right. Well, you go down there again
and put the pressure stakes on her.

1238
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:08,527
Tell her that if she won't cooperate,
it'll scotch her permit for all time

1239
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:10,152
and probably get her
run out of the country as well.

1240
01:15:10,176 --> 01:15:12,486
Now, give it the full orchestra.
This is important.

1241
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,510
Right.

1242
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,777
Back hall?

1243
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:19,486
Sergeant ogle of the squad.
Is our driver back yet?

1244
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,611
Do you really think
he'll contact her, guv?

1245
01:15:21,635 --> 01:15:23,569
Well, it's worth a try, anyway.

1246
01:15:23,593 --> 01:15:26,236
I'd have thought a villain like Damion
would be too busy keeping out of sight

1247
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,611
to worry about his girl.

1248
01:15:27,635 --> 01:15:30,902
I've long ago stopped forecasting
what they'll do.

1249
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,902
The criminal mind is predictable,
isn't it, sir?

1250
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:35,736
The criminal mind?

1251
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,440
It's the dark side of the moon, laddie.

1252
01:15:43,926 --> 01:15:45,277
OK, kids? OK.

1253
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:48,194
Right, you follow over by the piano.
The rest of you can relax.

1254
01:15:48,218 --> 01:15:50,718
Give a rest to Anya.

1255
01:15:53,385 --> 01:15:55,319
- Hi, Anya.
- Hello, Sally.

1256
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:57,069
- Cigarette?
- Oh, thank you, darling.

1257
01:15:57,093 --> 01:16:05,093
- Anya, there's a phone call for you.
- Thank you, Jim. Excuse me, darling.

1258
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,260
- Hello.
- It's me.

1259
01:16:10,551 --> 01:16:11,551
Paddy.

1260
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,736
Oh, it's been terrible.
I didn't know about...

1261
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,810
Listen.

1262
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:18,361
Are you being watched?

1263
01:16:18,385 --> 01:16:20,319
- I don't think so.
- Good.

1264
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:22,986
Meet me at the corner where
I dropped you that first night, remember?

1265
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:25,777
- What time?
- As near to nine as you can make it.

1266
01:16:25,801 --> 01:16:27,694
Isn't that dangerous?

1267
01:16:27,718 --> 01:16:31,277
I've got to see you, flower.
Have you been missing me too?

1268
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:33,861
Oh, yes, I have. Oh, paddy, I...

1269
01:16:33,885 --> 01:16:37,319
Save it for tonight, darling.

1270
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:38,543
Goodbye.

1271
01:17:10,176 --> 01:17:11,652
Scotland yard.

1272
01:17:11,676 --> 01:17:14,426
Extension 796, please.

1273
01:17:15,176 --> 01:17:16,856
Flying squad.

1274
01:17:18,093 --> 01:17:23,133
I would like to speak with
mr ogle, please.

1275
01:17:23,551 --> 01:17:26,236
My name is Patrick Damion.
I'm 32 years old.

1276
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,111
I weigh 13 stone 8
and I want to talk to my lawyer.

1277
01:17:29,135 --> 01:17:31,069
You'd better change that tune pdq

1278
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:33,194
if you want to walk out of here
with all your teeth.

1279
01:17:33,218 --> 01:17:34,736
Now, come on, say something sensible.

1280
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,069
Well, have you taken
any good bribes lately?

1281
01:17:37,093 --> 01:17:40,694
You carry on like that and you'll get
your face smashed in, clever Jack!

1282
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:42,652
By you and how many others?

1283
01:17:42,676 --> 01:17:46,111
All right.
Now, don't put the lip on, Damion.

1284
01:17:46,135 --> 01:17:48,486
Let's go over this once again.

1285
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:53,277
You went to the gym about 11:30 with
foulcher, tanky Thomas and the spade.

1286
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:56,944
There's no point in denying that,
we've got witnesses. What do you say?

1287
01:17:56,968 --> 01:17:59,444
My name is Patrick Damion.
I'm 32 years old...

1288
01:17:59,468 --> 01:18:03,548
And you weigh 13 stone 8? We know!

1289
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:11,460
Like to try the water? It's lovely.

1290
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:15,902
According to this, you shared a cell
with Peters and Wally at the ville.

1291
01:18:15,926 --> 01:18:20,527
- Is that right?
- If you know, why ask?

1292
01:18:20,551 --> 01:18:24,236
When you came out,
Peters staked you, didn't he?

1293
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,610
Find out.

1294
01:18:28,218 --> 01:18:32,111
That's what I fully intend to do.

1295
01:18:32,135 --> 01:18:34,135
Are you kidding?

1296
01:18:34,718 --> 01:18:37,944
I knew they couldn't hold me longer
than 24 hours without evidence.

1297
01:18:37,968 --> 01:18:40,694
- I'm not worried.
- That's very foolish of you.

1298
01:18:40,718 --> 01:18:43,069
They've only got to make one witness talk.

1299
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:46,027
They won't do that, I promise you.
What about Damion?

1300
01:18:46,051 --> 01:18:48,361
- What about him?
- He was a friend of Peters.

1301
01:18:48,385 --> 01:18:51,069
And you used that friendship
to get Peters.

1302
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,152
Damion won't have liked that.

1303
01:18:53,176 --> 01:18:55,111
He still won't grass. He's got more sense.

1304
01:18:55,135 --> 01:18:56,485
I wonder.

1305
01:18:57,676 --> 01:19:00,069
Look, he may have a bit of a ruck
at me personally,

1306
01:19:00,093 --> 01:19:03,152
but he'd never talk to the bogeys,
take my word for that.

1307
01:19:03,176 --> 01:19:05,194
All the same, be prudent.

1308
01:19:05,218 --> 01:19:07,111
Buy a little insurance.

1309
01:19:07,135 --> 01:19:08,635
Like what?

1310
01:19:08,885 --> 01:19:10,861
He is very close to Wally Smith, isn't he?

1311
01:19:10,885 --> 01:19:11,885
Yeah.

1312
01:19:12,176 --> 01:19:15,277
Very loyal kind of boy, mr Damion.

1313
01:19:15,301 --> 01:19:23,101
He wouldn't want anything to happen
to his other friend, would he?

1314
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:26,277
All right, damn you, it was Harry!

1315
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:28,277
He used me for his decoy.

1316
01:19:28,301 --> 01:19:30,819
- Well, that was pretty cheap.
- Cheap?

1317
01:19:30,843 --> 01:19:32,486
He's human vermin!

1318
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:38,630
That's the kind of scum
that you're covering up for?

1319
01:19:39,926 --> 01:19:43,361
I'll see to him in my own way,
without any help from you.

1320
01:19:43,385 --> 01:19:46,111
What about the top man, paddy?
Isn't he just as guilty?

1321
01:19:46,135 --> 01:19:48,402
He must have put Harry up to it.

1322
01:19:48,426 --> 01:19:50,069
What top man?

1323
01:19:50,093 --> 01:19:52,468
There's only Harry.

1324
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:56,385
You're a bad liar, boy!

1325
01:19:56,426 --> 01:19:59,069
All right, take him over to the Nick
and charge him.

1326
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:00,293
Of what?

1327
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:03,069
Well, let's see now.
We've got quite a choice, haven't we?

1328
01:20:03,093 --> 01:20:05,777
Being a suspected person,
loitering with intent.

1329
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,152
Where was it you picked him up?
What time?

1330
01:20:08,176 --> 01:20:10,926
Curzon street, 9:35pm.

1331
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:13,902
Being in possession of house-breaking
implements by night then.

1332
01:20:13,926 --> 01:20:16,652
- That's a better one, Bob.
- Oh, what are you talking about, guv?

1333
01:20:16,676 --> 01:20:21,152
One pair of gloves, one mica calender,
one penknife.

1334
01:20:21,176 --> 01:20:23,236
- Do you want me to go on?
- That's a right Liberty, mr sayers.

1335
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:26,319
- You know I'm not screwing now.
- I might believe you.

1336
01:20:26,343 --> 01:20:27,986
But would the judge?

1337
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:32,930
Oh, what chance have I got
with my record?

1338
01:20:37,843 --> 01:20:45,843
Now look, paddy, if you want it the hard
way that's the way you're gonna get it.

1339
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:51,569
How can I get out of it then, guv?

1340
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:54,902
Be a witness against foulcher, one.

1341
01:20:54,926 --> 01:20:59,966
And two, put me on to
the brain behind him.

1342
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,480
Call back your dogs, mr sayers.

1343
01:21:09,135 --> 01:21:10,135
Hbi.

1344
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,460
Come on.

1345
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:16,027
I thought you were straight, mr sayers.

1346
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:18,444
I thought the same about you, boy, once.

1347
01:21:18,468 --> 01:21:21,828
Seems we were both mistaken.

1348
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,593
What a country!

1349
01:21:27,718 --> 01:21:32,111
We know who did a murder but we can't
charge him without positive evidence.

1350
01:21:32,135 --> 01:21:35,611
When we pick up a witness who admits
to being present at the killing,

1351
01:21:35,635 --> 01:21:38,569
we can't get a statement from him
that would stick in court.

1352
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:43,111
And we even have to scrape the barrel
for a way of holding on to him.

1353
01:21:43,135 --> 01:21:45,944
How far are you prepared to go
to tidy this thing up?

1354
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:47,402
Get foulcher, you mean?

1355
01:21:47,426 --> 01:21:49,527
Him, the top man,
the whole mob at the back.

1356
01:21:49,551 --> 01:21:52,027
The whole way,
short of losing my pension.

1357
01:21:52,051 --> 01:21:53,736
Well, fasten your seatbelt, copper,

1358
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:01,760
this is where we begin to tilt the scales
of justice in our direction for a change.

1359
01:22:06,676 --> 01:22:10,902
I don't know what
your dad's gonna say, I really don't.

1360
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,236
Hello, boy.

1361
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,986
- Treating you right?
- Thanks for coming.

1362
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:20,570
- Anything you want?
- Just to get out.

1363
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,486
Oh, I, er... I've got a message for you.

1364
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,885
- Who from?
- Harry.

1365
01:22:27,593 --> 01:22:30,819
He says that he's sorry you were nicked

1366
01:22:30,843 --> 01:22:33,819
and he'll look after you in the usual way
if you go down.

1367
01:22:33,843 --> 01:22:35,043
Does he?

1368
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,652
Oh, and I'm to tell you

1369
01:22:37,676 --> 01:22:42,111
that if you grass, some of the boys
will be giving me a kicking.

1370
01:22:42,135 --> 01:22:44,319
The dirty bastard!

1371
01:22:44,343 --> 01:22:46,319
Don't let it needle you, boy.

1372
01:22:46,343 --> 01:22:49,194
I've been doing some
thinking about this lot.

1373
01:22:49,218 --> 01:22:51,319
As you know,
I've been a thief most of my life.

1374
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:54,569
I started screwing before I left school.

1375
01:22:54,593 --> 01:22:57,861
But I'm telling you,
if these yobs are today's villains,

1376
01:22:57,885 --> 01:22:59,361
I don't want any part of them.

1377
01:22:59,385 --> 01:23:01,611
Beating up shopkeepers
for a few lousy quid a week,

1378
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:03,111
terrorising women.

1379
01:23:03,135 --> 01:23:06,444
They're even putting the black
on straight thieves now.

1380
01:23:06,468 --> 01:23:09,611
I'll tell you, boy, for my money
they're lower than dirt

1381
01:23:09,635 --> 01:23:11,986
and I don't care what
they threaten to do to me.

1382
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:15,319
If you want to keep mates with me...

1383
01:23:15,343 --> 01:23:20,152
You shop 'em good,
shop the whole bleedin' mob of 'em.

1384
01:23:20,176 --> 01:23:22,236
It's not like me.

1385
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:25,194
But if I were you,
I'd tell sayers the truth

1386
01:23:25,218 --> 01:23:27,694
and let the heavy mob
sort them out in their own way.

1387
01:23:27,718 --> 01:23:29,218
Time's up!

1388
01:23:32,926 --> 01:23:34,902
Well, look after yourself.

1389
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,861
Don't worry about Wally.

1390
01:23:36,885 --> 01:23:41,325
Bounces like a rubber ball. Remember?

1391
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:12,968
Yeah?

1392
01:24:13,051 --> 01:24:15,402
- Seen the paper?
- Yeah.

1393
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:19,194
I've been thinking for some time
of taking a little trip.

1394
01:24:19,218 --> 01:24:20,819
This seems the appropriate moment.

1395
01:24:20,843 --> 01:24:22,694
You might be right. Where to?

1396
01:24:22,718 --> 01:24:25,069
Well, in your special circumstances,

1397
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:27,319
my advice would be
to choose a country with which...

1398
01:24:27,343 --> 01:24:29,611
Britain has no extradition treaty.

1399
01:24:29,635 --> 01:24:32,736
Like patagonia, for example.
What about the books?

1400
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,069
Oh, don't worry about that. I'll put them
where no one will ever find them.

1401
01:24:36,093 --> 01:24:37,093
Right.

1402
01:25:17,135 --> 01:25:20,361
I came as quickly as I could.
You weren't followed?

1403
01:25:20,385 --> 01:25:22,861
Oh, paddy, you look exhausted.

1404
01:25:22,885 --> 01:25:24,694
Did you get everything?

1405
01:25:24,718 --> 01:25:26,368
Fifty quid.

1406
01:25:26,468 --> 01:25:29,111
- It was all I could raise in the time.
- Well, that's fine.

1407
01:25:29,135 --> 01:25:32,152
- You'll get it back.
- Oh...

1408
01:25:32,176 --> 01:25:35,416
You know, Anya shopped you.

1409
01:25:36,968 --> 01:25:40,069
I owe you an apology
the size of that tower.

1410
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,843
Oh, forget it!

1411
01:25:44,176 --> 01:25:46,236
I spoke to Billy fielder.

1412
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,527
He says that he can get you
out to Dublin tonight.

1413
01:25:49,551 --> 01:25:54,361
But you must be in Bristol
not later than nine o'clock.

1414
01:25:54,385 --> 01:25:56,402
You're a good kid. I'll go tomorrow.

1415
01:25:56,426 --> 01:25:59,236
No! That might be too late.

1416
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,986
Well, I'll have to take a chance on that.

1417
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:04,490
- But why?
- Oh, you know why!

1418
01:26:05,468 --> 01:26:08,828
He shot Alfie in cold blood.

1419
01:26:10,093 --> 01:26:12,593
Can I come with you?

1420
01:26:13,343 --> 01:26:14,861
Do you want to come with me?

1421
01:26:14,885 --> 01:26:15,935
Please.

1422
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:18,185
Please.

1423
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:22,111
Oh, if I had a wish...

1424
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:24,010
Well, you know.

1425
01:26:26,593 --> 01:26:32,027
Meet me at Paddington bookstall
at nine in the morning. OK?

1426
01:26:32,051 --> 01:26:34,801
Take care of yourself.

1427
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,444
All right, Sadie.

1428
01:26:55,468 --> 01:26:56,944
What do you want me for?

1429
01:26:56,968 --> 01:27:00,902
Mr sayers just wants to ask you
a few questions.

1430
01:27:00,926 --> 01:27:02,426
All right.

1431
01:29:15,426 --> 01:29:18,861
I wasn't aware the lift was out of order,
mr Damion...

1432
01:29:18,885 --> 01:29:20,885
Now, don't move.

1433
01:29:21,426 --> 01:29:25,026
May I not even use an ashtray?

1434
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:28,986
I'm wondering...

1435
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:35,130
What brings about this unusual
and unexpected visit?

1436
01:29:36,968 --> 01:29:40,444
Now, don't you think I won't use this.

1437
01:29:40,468 --> 01:29:43,986
In that case,
consider me at your disposal.

1438
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:47,250
Now, get Harry here, quick!

1439
01:30:09,051 --> 01:30:10,051
Yeah?

1440
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:12,569
- Harry. Waldo.
- Oh, yes, Waldo, what is it?

1441
01:30:12,593 --> 01:30:14,069
Can you come over?

1442
01:30:14,093 --> 01:30:17,277
Er, some last-minute details
I want to discuss.

1443
01:30:17,301 --> 01:30:19,361
Well, is it important? Yes.

1444
01:30:19,385 --> 01:30:21,111
Very important.

1445
01:30:21,135 --> 01:30:24,035
I'll be over right away.

1446
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,885
Only a cigarette.

1447
01:30:36,135 --> 01:30:41,944
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Of course. Make yourself at home.

1448
01:30:41,968 --> 01:30:45,527
May one ask what your intention is
with Harry?

1449
01:30:45,551 --> 01:30:48,861
Let's say, an eye for an eye.

1450
01:30:48,885 --> 01:30:50,635
Very biblical.

1451
01:30:50,885 --> 01:30:55,736
But how would it advantage you to expose
yourself to a charge of having, er...

1452
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,635
Eliminated him?

1453
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:03,236
You suffer from the taint of gentility,
mr zhernikov.

1454
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:06,135
The word is "murdered".

1455
01:31:40,176 --> 01:31:41,856
Tanky, nero.

1456
01:31:42,718 --> 01:31:43,819
Foulcher.

1457
01:31:43,843 --> 01:31:44,843
Good.

1458
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:52,385
Right, let's go.

1459
01:31:59,218 --> 01:32:01,968
You lot stay out here.

1460
01:32:06,593 --> 01:32:09,093
Come in, Harry. “...

1461
01:32:09,885 --> 01:32:11,565
So, Waldo...

1462
01:32:12,218 --> 01:32:17,738
You said it was important,
what's it all about?

1463
01:32:18,676 --> 01:32:19,876
What...?

1464
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,152
As you see, I am not the host tonight.

1465
01:32:25,176 --> 01:32:27,402
You keep out of this
and you won't get hurt.

1466
01:32:27,426 --> 01:32:29,301
In that case...

1467
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:30,819
Far, far...

1468
01:32:30,843 --> 01:32:33,468
All right, paddy boy?

1469
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,486
Now, paddy, now, give us a chance.

1470
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:44,870
I'll give you exactly the same chance
as you gave alf.

1471
01:32:59,093 --> 01:33:00,093
Aagh!

1472
01:33:14,718 --> 01:33:15,718
Aagh!

1473
01:33:29,093 --> 01:33:33,053
Come on, boy. Come on, paddy boy!

1474
01:33:33,635 --> 01:33:37,835
Come on, boy, come on!
Come on, lad!

1475
01:33:37,968 --> 01:33:42,402
All right, you're both nicked.
Take 'em away.

1476
01:33:42,426 --> 01:33:44,527
Come on! Come on, paddy!

1477
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:46,986
What are you afraid of, son?
What are you afraid of?

1478
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:48,819
- What are you afraid of?
- Aagh!

1479
01:33:48,843 --> 01:33:50,694
Come on, boy! Come on now!

1480
01:33:50,718 --> 01:33:55,758
Come on. Come on now then.
Come on, you...!

1481
01:33:57,801 --> 01:33:58,801
Aagh!

1482
01:34:06,926 --> 01:34:09,301
Do your stuff, Bob.

1483
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:22,361
Take care of that.

1484
01:34:22,385 --> 01:34:26,345
Here, let me have a look at that.

1485
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:30,676
- Dead?
- As a doornail.

1486
01:34:33,218 --> 01:34:36,118
So that's the big fella?

1487
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:39,135
Well, well, Waldo.

1488
01:34:39,968 --> 01:34:42,152
I never thought it might be you.

1489
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:45,027
Inspector, I don't know
what this is all about.

1490
01:34:45,051 --> 01:34:47,819
Mr foulcher here was consulting me
in my professional capacities...

1491
01:34:47,843 --> 01:34:49,611
Save it for the jury.

1492
01:34:49,635 --> 01:34:52,402
- You got your breath back?
- Just about.

1493
01:34:52,426 --> 01:34:58,152
Well, as I see it, the charge can be
either manslaughter or murder.

1494
01:34:58,176 --> 01:35:00,652
And what makes a difference?

1495
01:35:00,676 --> 01:35:04,276
That is my top man, is it not?

1496
01:35:05,176 --> 01:35:07,777
I don't think he's got anything
to contribute, inspector,

1497
01:35:07,801 --> 01:35:09,736
that would involve me without...

1498
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,361
Involving others closer to him.

1499
01:35:13,385 --> 01:35:15,861
Now, there speaks your syndicate, boy.

1500
01:35:15,885 --> 01:35:18,611
Do you think they'll ever
leave you alone after that?

1501
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:25,235
You may be tough enough to take it
but what about Sadie?

1502
01:35:28,468 --> 01:35:30,468
That's your man.

1503
01:35:33,051 --> 01:35:37,694
You'll find a safe in the mantelpiece
there with all the evidence you need.

1504
01:35:37,718 --> 01:35:41,078
- Take him down.
- All right.

1505
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,111
I doubt if any experienced broker

1506
01:35:46,135 --> 01:35:52,375
would give tuppence for
your life expectancy, Damion.

1507
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,260
OK.

1508
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:04,611
In that case, I'd better make the most
of the time that's left.

1509
01:36:04,635 --> 01:36:07,819
Good boy. Now, we'd
better get that arm seen to.

1510
01:36:07,843 --> 01:36:09,777
Hood, take him over to the hospital.

1511
01:36:09,801 --> 01:36:12,277
Come on, paddy, old son,
we'll soon get you patched up.

1512
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:14,027
Oh, such consideration.

1513
01:36:14,051 --> 01:36:15,944
A few days ago, you're all
for kicking my teeth in.

1514
01:36:15,968 --> 01:36:23,968
You're an important man now, paddy.
We've got to watch over you like a baby.

1515
01:36:28,801 --> 01:36:30,652
Yeah, but for how long?

1516
01:36:30,676 --> 01:36:32,944
Till the trial and then... clck!

1517
01:36:32,968 --> 01:36:36,777
No, Bob, you're wrong. This time
we've really got to make it work.

1518
01:36:36,801 --> 01:36:39,569
If we don't, the hoodlums and mobsters
will be dominating this country

1519
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:42,069
before we know what's hit us.

1520
01:36:42,093 --> 01:36:47,152
I don't want my kids to grow up in a world
run by scum like that. Do you?

1521
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,361
Now, get it cleaned up in here, will you?

1522
01:36:49,385 --> 01:36:50,385
Sure.

1523
01:36:59,343 --> 01:37:02,694
You certainly cleared out
a lot of weeds tonight, guv'nor.

1524
01:37:02,718 --> 01:37:09,194
Well, I think we can say justice is slowly
catching up with the 20th century.

1525
01:37:09,218 --> 01:37:11,843
But to the yard, sir?

1526
01:37:12,051 --> 01:37:13,701
Where else?
