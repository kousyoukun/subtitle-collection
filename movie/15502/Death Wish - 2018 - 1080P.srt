Just dial down the language, there's kids here.

140
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,590
我要是不呢
Or what?

141
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,120
保罗 拜托
Uh, Paul, come on.

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,660
我如果是你的话 我就闭嘴了
I would just shut the fuck up if I were you.

143
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,290
这是好主意 你为何不这样呢
That's a good idea. Why don't you do that?

144
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,630
就当是我 闭上嘴

再说一遍
Say it again.

147

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,880

149
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,840

150
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,550
- 说啊 说啊 - 住手

151
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,720
- 住手 住手 - 过来

然后那人就走到我爸面前
Okay, so then the guy gets right in Dad's face, okay?

156
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,730
开始推换他
And he starts shoving him

157
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,000
让比赛都停下来了
and it literally stops the game.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,100
喷了我一脸口水
Spitting right in my face.

159

还得逼着我出面
I had to get in the middle of it.

160
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,440
我都想揍他一拳
I was gonna punch the guy. Right?

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,910
你为何不揍他一顿呢
Why didn't you whoop this guy's butt?

162
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,180
就像你当年那样
Like in the old days.

163

幸好你妈拉着我

Fighting all the time.

172
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,490
他大喊大叫 在家里哭
You know, he was screaming and crying in the house.

173
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,930
你猜是谁哭
And guess who was crying?

This way, when you go to college, and these guys,

when they get a little too aggressive with you,

179
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,840
你就知道该做什么
you know what to do.

180

别以为我在开玩笑
Don't look at me like I don't know what I'm talking about.

208
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,970

I mean, it's not like I'm a criminal, but...

So, no birthday dinner at La Fonda?

246
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,190
Mmm-mmm.

247
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,490
我去告诉法兰克叔叔
I'll go tell Uncle Frank.

248
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,960
- 对不起 爸爸 - 没关系 孩子
- Sorry, Daddy. - Oh, it's all right, hon.

249
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,130
我只惦记那个三奶蛋糕
I just had my heart set on that tres leches cake.

250
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,970

251
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,970
好的 孩子
All right, baby.

252
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,870
我们明晚再庆祝
We will celebrate tomorrow night.

253
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,210
别担心 我保证
Don't worry at all, I promise.

254
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,040

It's all right.

258
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,090
嗨 保罗
Hey, Paul.

259
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
生日快乐 老头
Happy birthday, old man.

260
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,790
拜托
Oh, come on.

261
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,460
- 第一排的票 - 你啥都没给我买
- First baseline. - You don't get me anything.

262
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,260
你们可要带我去看过比赛
You better be taking me to that game.

263
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,750
为什么不让拉万达饭店送餐呢 那样简单多了
Why can't we just Postmates La Fonda? It's so much easier.

264
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,820
我们的蛋糕要比他们的好得多
Our cake is gonna be so much better

265
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,590
因为我们是用爱做出来的
because we're gonna make it with love.

266
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,290
但拉万达也是用爱做的
Yeah, but La Fonda makes it with love.

267
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,190
我们也知道爸爸爱吃他们的蛋糕
And we know that Dad already loves it,

268
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,590
所以算是双赢
so it's kind of a win-win.

269
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,030
不 这是他的生日
No, it's his birthday.

270
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,100
他会欣慰我们出了力
He's gonna love knowing that we actually made the effort.

271
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,360
我们用心了
We did the work.

272
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,600
我们可以把厨房弄得一团糟
So we can make the effort to dirty up the kitchen,

273
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,770
然后当他回家的时候
and then when he gets home,

274
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,840
我们就假装做了一整夜的蛋糕
we just pretend that we cooked all night.

275
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,210
孩子 我们要做蛋糕
Honey, we're making the cake.

276
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,940
孩子 你能把我的iPad拿来吗
Honey, could you get me my iPad?

277
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,980
好像是在楼上的床头柜上
I think it's upstairs on the nightstand.

278
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,510

嗨 苏菲
Hi, Soph.

281
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,760
我听不见你
I can't hear you.

282
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,100
我已经缩小到两个选择
Okay, so I've narrowed it down to two options.

283
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,200
要嘛是三居北路 要嘛是七号路
I'm thinking either Third North or Seventh Street.

284
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,640
三号北路那间房子卧室大
Third North has bigger bedrooms

285
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,140
但七号路那间房子的所在区域
but I think that Seventh Street is just, like,

286
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,340
感觉要好得多
a way cooler area.

287
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,550
孩子 你拿到iPad了吗
Honey, did you get that iPad?

288
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,520
是的 在你的床头柜里面 不是在上面
Yeah, it was in your dresser, not on it.

289
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,780

293
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,530
乔丹

294
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,870

Oh, my God. Will you calm down? I said I'm coming.

295
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,040

304
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,670

Now here's, uh, here's what's gonna happen.

307

你节省我们20分钟时间
Mom, you're gonna save me 20 minutes

308
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,340
去打开保险柜
by opening the safe.

309
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,550
好
Okay.

310
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,310
然后我要把你和你女儿绑在一起
Then I'm gonna tie you up with your daughter,

311
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,550
这样我们走远之前 你就没法打电话
so you won't be calling anyone till we're long gone.

312
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,650
好
Okay.

313
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,080
如果你这么做的话 就不会有人受到伤害
Now if you could do that, nobody gets hurt.

314
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,150

319
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,260
这完全取决于你
Oh, that's entirely up to you.

320

没有
No.

405
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,410
很多这种人

闯进住宅寻找枪 因为容易出手

寻找我的枪

409
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,150
你们觉得就是这样？
So that's what you think this was?

410
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,850
是抢劫过程发生意外？
It was a robbery gone bad?

411
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,320
最近在北岸地区发生了

一系列室内抢劫案

413
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,030

417
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,370
不 我不知道
No, I didn't know about it.

418
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,570
你们觉得这不重要
What, you don't think it's important enough

419
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,840
不需要告诉居民吗
to tell the residents?

420
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,440
每个嫌犯我们都张贴在社区巡守处
We post every crime on the Neighborhood Watch.

421

If it's big enough,

422
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,840
媒体会选择报导
the media picks it up and reports about it.

423
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,980
否则就只是一般抢劫案
If not, these are just burglaries.

424
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,750
只是一般抢劫案
Just burglaries.

425
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,850
法兰克 这不是他的意思
Frank, that's not what he meant.

426
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,150
我只是想知道
No, I'm just wondering,

427
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,520
现在是否能足够引起他们的重视
if it's important enough now, to go on their radar...

428
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,190
你这是帮倒忙
You're not helping.

429
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,290
今晚很不幸
You guys, it's been a long night.

430
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,160
我们也了解了不少讯息了
I think we got enough to start with.

431
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,630
- 是的 - 是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

432
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,290
这是我的名片
This is my card.

433
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,390
谢谢
Thanks.

434
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,030
上面有我的手机号码
It's got my cell phone number on there,

435
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,530
如果你知道别的情况的话
if you've got anything else.

436
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,300
谢谢你 雷恩斯侦探
Thank you, Detective Raines.

437
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,210
我理解你的愤怒
You know, I... I get that you're upset.

438
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,910
我们也火大了
We're upset, too.

439
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,010
但我们会抓住他们的
But we're gonna get these guys.

440
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,620
我再次向你致以哀悼
Again, I'm... I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

441
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,320
- 谢谢 - 谢谢你们抽出时间
- Thank you. - Thanks for your time.

442
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,290
科尔西医生 你女儿手术结束了
Dr. Kersey, your daughter's out of surgery.

443
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,590
她的手术很顺利
Her surgery went well.

444
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,270
她依然在昏迷中 但她情况稳定
She's still in a coma, but she's stable.

445
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,900
他们清除了血块
They were able to evacuate the hematoma

446
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,640
取出了弹片
and remove the bullet fragments.

447
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,310
我只知道这些了
I wish I had more to tell you.

448
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,590
我今天要带妈妈回家去找外公
So, I gotta take Mom home to Grandpa today.

449
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,090
法兰克叔叔会暂时接替我为你读书
Uncle Frank's gonna take over reading duties for now.

450
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:46,070
我非常爱你 非常爱 孩子
I love you so much. Oh, so much, baby.

451
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,470
我们很快再见 孩子
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

452
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,510
当露西的母亲去世时
When Lucy's mother passed,

453
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,810
她转身对我说：
she turned to me and said,

454
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,180
上帝为何这么早带走她
"Why did God take her so soon?"

455
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,490
我只能说：孩子 我不知道
All I could say was, "Honey, I don't know.

456
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,490
我想上帝自有其安排
I think it's part of His plan.

457
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,890
我们必须相信他的安排
And we have to trust His plan."

458
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,730
我们以前常来这里看她
We used to come up here and visit her and...

459
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,640
现在
Well...

460
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,640
我又来了
Now here I am.

461
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,480
我要说些我不该说的话
And I'm seeing something I was never meant to see.

462
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,050
怎么可能是上帝的安排
How is this part of His plan?

463
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,160
哪有这样的安排啊
How is this part of any plan?

464
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,070
谢谢你 保罗 谢谢你带她回家
Thank you, Paul, for bringing her home.

465
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,840
这是她想来的地方 和她妈妈葬在一起
This is where she wanted to be. With her mom.

466
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,370
我总有一天会去见她们
One day, I'll join 'em.

467
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,080
这里永远都有你的位置
There'll always be a place here for you.

468
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,880
谢谢
Thanks.

469
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,610
警方有线索了吗
Have the police gotten anywhere?

470
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,020
邻居看到有三个修理工 开着一辆白色面包车
One of the neighbors saw three repairmen in a white van.

471
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,620
警方似乎相当确定
The police seem pretty confident.

472
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,280
该死 快跑
Oh, damn. Run!

473
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,190
盗猎者 来
Poachers! Come on!

474
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,960
快走
Go, go!

475
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,370
人们依赖警察保护他们的安全
People rely on the police to keep them safe.

476
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,280
这就是问题所在
That's the problem.

477
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,450
警察只在
The police only arrive

478
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,920
案发后才到
after the crime has taken place.

479
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,950
这就像
That's like...

480
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,750
在狐狸
Trapping the fox

481
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,860
出了鸡窝才去捉鸡
as he's comin' out of the hen house.

482
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,760
如果一个人真想保护自己的东西
If a man really wants to protect what's his...

483
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,030
他就必须自己去做
He has to do it for himself.

484
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,640
这里是乐谱电台 我是曼考
All right, this is The Loop. I'm the Mancow.

485
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,570
7点15分 7点1刻
7:15, a quarter past 7:00.

486
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,980
早安
Good morning.

487
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,240
死亡之城又一个美好的周末
Another great weekend here, the city of death.

488
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,640
这个周末有48个人受到枪击
Forty-eight people shot over the weekend.

489
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,810
48个人中枪
Forty-eight freaking people shot.

490
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,420
13人死亡 情况越来越严重
Thirteen dead. And, uh, this... It's getting worse.

491
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,780
数字还在上升
The numbers are up.

492
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,950
不知道我们还能忍受多久
You wonder how much more of this we can take.

493
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,650
对不起 科尔西医生 还没一点线索
I'm sorry, Dr. Kersey, nothing yet.

494
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,020
一点都没有？
Nothing?

495
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,690
别急 这并不罕见
Don't be alarmed. It's not uncommon.

496
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,460
验尸一般需要一两星期
Forensics usually takes a week or two.

497
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,960
线人举报也是一样
Uh, same with informants.

498
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,000
喂
Hey!

499
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,430
对不起 有个混蛋要为我擦车窗
I'm sorry. Some asshole's trying to clean my windshield.

500
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,770
喂 够了 走开吧
Hey, that's enough. Go on.

501
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,970
撞死他就是了 不算犯罪
Run 'em over. Doesn't count as a crime.

502
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,270
我能这么做？
I can do that?

503
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,070
我的办公室里还有人
Look, I have someone in my office right now,

504
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,780
但杰克森侦探和我正在全力调查
but Detective Jackson and I are all over this, okay?

505
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,540
喂 够了
Hey! That's it!

506
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,980
有情况的话我们会通知你
We'll get back to you as soon as we have more information.

507
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,780
- 拜托 做点什么 - 是啊
- Come on! Just do something. - Yep.

508
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,020
- 你去死 - 好 我去死
- Fuck you! - Yes, fuck me.

509
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,090
给点零钱吧 拜托
Spare some change, man? Come on, man.

510
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,030
规范经济学和经济学的艺术
"Normative economics and the art of economics,

511
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,730
但却不能独立于
on the other hand, cannot be independent

512
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,330
实证经济学
of positive economics.

513
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,560
任何政策结论…
Any policy conclusion..."

514
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,570
苏菲
Sophie.

515
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,010
- 嗨 - 科尔西医生 嗨
- Hi. - Dr. Kersey, hi.

516
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,510
护士允许我进来的
The nurses let me come in here.

517
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,510
不 没关系
No, it's okay.

518
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,880
你来我很高兴
I'm glad you're here.

519
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,280
你还好吗
How are you doing?

520
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,350
我很好 你呢
I'm okay. How are you?

521
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,950
我还好 谢谢
Doing okay. Thank you.

522
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,950
你在念什么
What are you reading?

523
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,920
米尔顿·弗里德曼的"实证经济学论文集"
Um, Essays in Positive Economics by Milton Friedman.

524
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,290
这恐怕不能帮她醒来
I'm not sure that's gonna help her wake up.

525
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,130
是啊 很枯燥
Yeah, I know, it's boring.

526
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,300
呃
Um...

527
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,230
但这本书在纽约大学的暑假阅读书单上
But it's on the NYU summer reading list

528
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,240
所以我就念了
and I'm reading it anyway, so...

529
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,310
我觉得也许这样能…
I thought, I don't know, maybe this way...

530
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,380
能帮她赶上进度
This way, she won't get behind.

531
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,710
想让我走的话 我可以走
I can leave, if you want.

532
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,980
不...不 留下 留下
No, no. Stay. Stay.

533
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
对她有好处
It'd be good for her.

534
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,060
科尔西医生
Dr. Kersey...

535
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,290
你觉得这有帮助吗
Do you think it helps?

536
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,100
肯定有
I know it does.

537
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,770
我在我的床上睡不着
I can't sleep on our bed.

538
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,310
于是我就睡在沙发上 看着电视 直到我昏睡
So I sleep on the couch. I watch TV until I pass out.

539
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,810
但就算这样
Even then I...

540
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,780
还是没法睡着
I'm just not getting any sleep.

541
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,150
这是意料之中的
That's to be expected.

542
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,790
如果越来越严重的话 我可以开安眠药
I can prescribe sleeping pills if it gets worse.

543
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,460
感觉我是在炼狱中
I feel like I'm in purgatory.

544
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,630
没法回去上班 没法留在家里
I can't go back to work, I can't be around my house.

545
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
我小时候
When I was a kid,

546
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,200
经常坐火车 来躲着我父亲
I used to ride the trains to avoid my father.

547
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,670
甚至在车上做作业
And I would even do my homework then,

548
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,110
只为了能离他远点
just to stay away from him.

549
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,350
所以
So...

550
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,750
我最近就这么做
I've been doing that.

551
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,620
只是坐着火车
Just riding the trains...

552
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,660
胡思乱想
Just to think.

553
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,570
我也希望我看到的一切都能让我想起露西
I wish I could say everything I see reminds me of Lucy.

554
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,940
但我看到的一切都让我想起他们
But everything I see reminds me of them.

555
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,010
我从未见过的男人
The men I've never seen.

556
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
来我家里杀了她的人
The men who came and took her from me.

557
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,320
我是芝加哥警察局的
This is Detective Kevin Raines

558
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,650
凯文·雷恩斯侦探
of the Chicago Police Department.

559
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,790
如果有紧急情况 请拔打报警电话

560
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,020

那是个梦
"It was a dream,

562
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
他随时都可能醒来

563
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,960
我感谢上帝给了我乔丹

564
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,370
他们继续 一小时又一小时…

565
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,670

566
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,140
漂亮的擦棒球
Good clean cut right there.

567
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,010
一周内发生了多达90起枪击案
With as many as 90 shootings in a week,

568
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,510
芝加哥的暴力犯罪
violent crime in Chicago

569
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,580
创了20年来的新高 而警方…
is now at a 20-year high, while the police...

570
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,550
很难摆脱我的挫折感
It's hard to escape the feeling that I failed.

571
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,820
没能保护我老婆
Failed to protect my wife.

572
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,920
没能保护我女儿
Failed to protect my daughter.

573
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,100
没能尽到一个男人最该尽到的责任
Failed at the most important things a man does.

574
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,540
- 给 孩子 - 谢谢了
- Here you go, kid. - Thanks, man.

575
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,640
不 不是个U
No. It's not a "U."

576
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,710
是个E
"E."

577
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,450
K-E-R-S-E-Y…

对 科尔西
Right. Kersey.

579
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,080
雷恩斯侦探不在
Detective Raines isn't in.

580
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,310
你想留言吗
Would you like to leave a message?

581
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320

Yes.

582
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,650
这是个过程
This is a process.

583
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,020
需要时间
And it's gonna take time.

584
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,460
我知道这是个过程
Yeah, I know it's a process.

585
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,730
我只是

586
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,140
很想知道个结果
Starting to wonder about the result, that's all.

587

我知道这过程
Listen, I understand the process

588
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,520
需要一些时间
takes a little bit of time, all right?

589
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520

不含麸质（面筋棒）

594
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,560
先生 我能帮你什么吗
Sir, can I help you?

595
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,860
是的 我来找雷恩斯侦探

598

我叫保罗·科尔西
My name is Paul Kersey.

599
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,900
K-U-R…
K-U-R...

600
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,000
E-R…
E-R...

601
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,170
- 对不起 - 没关系
- Sorry about that. - It's all right.

602
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,340
喂 科尔西医生 进来吧
Hey, Dr. Kersey. Dr. Kersey, come on back.

603
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,640
谢谢你 谢谢
Thank you. Thanks.

604
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,010
让他进来吧 威利
Buzz him in, Willy.

605
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,580
好
Yeah.

606
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,850
那个受伤歹徒的血液和皮肤
What about the DNA in the blood and skin

607
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,580
DNA检测结果呢
from the guy that got burned?

608
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,850
测试结果出来了
We got that test back.

609
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,920
在我们的数据库中没有匹配的人
It didn't match anybody in our database.

610
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,160
但如果抓到了人
But we can use it to put 'em there

611
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,660
就能当做证据
when we get one in custody.

612
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
我是雷恩斯
Yeah, Raines.

613
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,470
记下号码 我等会打给他
Get a number, I'll call him back.

614
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,310
CCA是什么
CCA?

615
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,310
已结案 凶手已逮捕
Cleared. Closed by arrest.

616
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,620
那么其它这些都是未破的案子？
So all these other ones are open cases?

617
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
是的
Yep.

618
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,320
多数都是黑帮犯罪
Most of these are gang-related.

619
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,390
黑帮之间的仇杀
Just asshole-on-asshole violence.

620
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,090
一个人在社交媒体上说了不该说的话
Some banger posts some shit on social media

621
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,260
就有人拿着一把AR-15去报复他
and they retaliate with an AR-15.

622
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,200
上周末一个人在一个派对上大开杀戒
Last weekend, a guy shot up a party.

623
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,900
一个人射中了14个人 却没一个目击者
One guy shoots 14 people, no one sees anything.

624
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,810
他们不会向警方提供线索 所以依然是未破的案子
They don't talk to the cops, that's why these stay open.

625
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,110
我的意思是 你老婆的案子不一样
Point is, your wife's case is different.

626
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,450
你想坐下吗
You wanna have a seat?

627
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,450
谢谢
Thanks.

628
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,890
三个劫匪慌了
I mean, that's three burglars who panicked.

629
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,420
我保证至少有一个人
I guarantee at least one of 'em

630
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,560
现在正担心的要命
is shittin' himself somewhere.

631
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,960
他一旦有个朋友
He's got a friend who's gonna get picked up

632
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,530
因为别的案子被捕
on something unrelated.

633
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,230
就会为了自己的自由出卖他的同伙
He's gonna sell his buddy down the river for his own freedom.

634
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,600
知道吗
Okay?

635
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,900
我还见过出卖自己亲娘的呢
I've seen guys turn in their own mother.

636
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,370
我悬赏征求线索好不好
What if I offered some kind of reward?

637
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,470
那样会冒出大量的假线索
We'll just get flooded with false leads.

638
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,900
我和搭档会把时间
Me and my partner are gonna have to

639
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,970
浪费在追踪假线索上
waste time tracking 'em down.

640
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,640
请个私家侦探如何
What about a private investigator?

641
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:36,280
如果是配偶外遇 人员失踪找私家侦探还可以
PI's good for cheating spouses, missing persons...

642
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,020
但侦办杀人案 只会拿钱不办事
But murder case, they'll just take your money.

643
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,650
他们不能参与警方调查的案子
They can't get involved in a police investigation.

644
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,220
否则就是破坏证据 容易被吊销执照
It's tampering with evidence, they could lose their license.

645
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,560
那么我就只能干等着
So there's nothing that I can do.

646
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,460
你是这个意思吗
Is that what you're saying?

647
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,330
你可以抱有信心
You can have faith.

648
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,140
信心对这些人有用吗
How'd faith work out for them?

649
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,270
This is Lake transfer to Orange...

650
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,610
Green, Purple, and Brown.

651
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,420
This is Red Line train to Howard.

652
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,290
我的天
Oh, shit!

653
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,120
你好 美女
Damn, what's up, baby?

654
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,290
嗨 美女
Hey, mama.

655
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,890
别走啊
What's poppin', redbone?

656
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,860
看你 你要去哪里
Look at you. Where you going, baby?

657
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,360
我能跟你一起去吗
Can I come with you?

658
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,660
看你的翘臀 看这丰满的大腿
Look at your fine ass. Look at them thick-ass thighs.

659
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,030
能告诉我你的号码吗 我能打给你吗
Can I get your number, baby? Can I call?

660
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,230
喂
Hey!

661
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,370
你小子说什么
What the fuck you say, puto?

662
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,700
别去烦她
Just leave her alone.

663
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,670
你在跟谁说话
Fuck you talking to?

664
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,640
别去烦她
Just leave her alone.

665
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,840
你脑子有病吗
What the fuck is your problem?

666
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,340
白痴
Punk-ass.

667
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,650
你以为你是谁啊
Who the fuck you think you are?

668
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,740
我开枪不是为了杀人 是为了活着
I don't shoot to kill, I shoot to stay alive.

669
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,340
遵纪守法的坏人是不存在的
Law-abiding criminals don't exist.

670
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,580
生死在一线之间时 警察却在千里之外
When seconds count, cops are minutes away.

671
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,050
来海盗旗体育用品店看看
Come on down to Jolly Roger's.

672
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,020
我们的一级枪械非常的优惠
We've got some badass deals on our F-1 firearms.

673
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,380
对了 现在
Ooh, and right now,

674
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,650
我们还有一种特别武器桌
we have a special on our tactical furniture.

675
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,860
让坏人措手不及
Surprise 'em.

676
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,020
这个适合你 小心…
Okay, here's a good one for you. Easy on the...

677
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,870
不 等等 年轻人
No, no, hold it, son.

678
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,740
第一次买枪？
First gun?

679
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,440
是的
Uh, yeah.

680
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,040
第一次压力会很大
It can be pretty overwhelming at first.

681
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,040
是啊
I'll say.

682
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,970
放心 有我帮你 我叫费雪妮
Don't worry, I got your back. I'm Bethany.

683
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,610

685
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,520
这里是我们所有的刀类武器
So over here we have all of our bladed weapons.

686
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,620
我后面的墙上是我们所有的步枪
Behind me on this wall are all of our rifles.

687
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,590
每把枪都赠送一盒子弹和两个弹匣
Each one comes with a free case and two PMAGs.

688
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,220
请跟我来这里
And if you follow me over here,

689
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,720
那里是我们所有的新型手枪
all of our new pistols are over there.

690
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,230
我们所有的武器都在这里
And all of our used weapons are right here.

691
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,960
二手？
- Used? - Oh.

692
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,230
当然不是曾用于犯罪的枪 二手的
Not used in crimes, obviously. But, you know, used.

693
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,970
不知道先介绍哪一款
I don't know where to begin.

694
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,940
我个人最喜欢的
Well, personally, my very favorite

695
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,200
是这种枪
is right over here.

696
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,210
对不起 请问一下
Forgive me for asking,

697
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,610
买枪需要什么手续
but what is the process for all of this?

698
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,610
肯定手续很繁琐吧
There must be a lot of paperwork, right?

699
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,010
哦
Oh.

705

然后再过72小时
And then it's just 72 hours,

709
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,460
你就能全副武装 准备出击了

Ooh, and we can set you up with a gun safe.

711
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,070
如果有人偷了这把枪
If someone ever steals that gun,

712
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,140
通过子弹就能查出是你的枪
those bullets can be traced right back to you.

713
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,940
我回去考虑考虑
I'm gonna think about it...

714
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,740

这是克拉克17手枪
This is the Glock 17,

725
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,460
可以说是史上最具代表性的手枪

726
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,270
今天 我要教你们如何拆卸它
Today, I'm gonna teach you how to take it apart.

727
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,270
然后用相反的步骤把枪组装起来
Then put it back together by simply reversing the steps.

728
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,310
向后轻推枪栓
Put slight backwards pressure on the slide,

729
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,310
枪栓会向前脱落
and the slide will release forward.

730
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,180
第三步 取下枪管
Step three, remove the barrel.

731
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,280

科尔西医生 去急诊室

735
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,580
科尔西医生请去急诊室

736
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,530
她发作了一次
She's had a seizure.

737
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,530
她不会有事吧
Is she gonna be okay?

738
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,300
我们唯一确定的是
The only thing we know for sure

739
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,210
她苏醒的可能一天比一天小
is her odds get less every day.

740
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,710
她戴着束缚
She's in handcuffs.

741
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,050
我的女儿戴着束缚
My daughter is in handcuffs.

742
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,920
而伤害她的人却逍遥法外
And the men who did it are out there.

743
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,620
自由自在
Free.

744
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,890
看这些禽兽对我女儿的伤害
Look what these animals did to my baby.

745
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,880

746
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880

752
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,010
啊

753
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,120
没事的 没事的 离开这里 走吧
It's okay, it's okay, get out of here. Go! Go!

754
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,210
让一下
Move over.

755
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,900
多雨的7月…
A rainy July...

756
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,670
机票大减价…
Tickets are now on sale for the...

757
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,730
芝加哥教师联合会
Chicago's teacher's union

758
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,820
采取了第一步…
has taken the first step...

759
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,520
喂
Hey!

760
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,530
我不认识他
I didn't know him.

761
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,230
他不知从哪里冒出来的
He just came out of nowhere.

762
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,830
他救了我的命
He saved my life.

763
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,870
就像一个守护天使
Like a guardian angel.

764
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,040
我听到了那女人喊叫
I heard that girl screaming

765
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,610
然后听到轮胎的摩擦声
and then I heard tires squealing,

766
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,880
很多次枪击 然后是撞车
a whole bunch of shots and then a crash.

767
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,790
那枪手呢
What about the shooter?

768
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,090
好像是个白人
He looked like a white dude.

769
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,060
穿着连帽上衣
He had a hoodie.

770
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,890
跟外面那对夫妻的描述相同
It's the same description the couple gave outside.

771
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,260
穿着连帽上衣的白人
White guy in a hoodie.

772
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,360
他们说他是守护天使
They called him a guardian angel.

773
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,630
应该说是死神才对
Yeah, more like a Grim Reaper.

774
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,930
你们看到他
I mean, did you see how

775
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,770
站在那人面前杀了他的样子吗
he stood over that guy and shot him?

776
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,600
很冷酷的
That shit was cold.

777
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,070
你看到他的面容了吗
Did you see his face?

778
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,640
Mmm-mmm.

779
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,740
他手臂上的痕迹或者纹身呢
How about marks on his arms or tattoos?

780
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,310
Mmm-mmm.

781
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,480
那么没什么对我们有用的线索？
So nothing that can help us?

782
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,380
当时天黑 他在开枪
It was dark. He was shooting.

783
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,980
呃
Um...

784
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,250
他一直这么甩着他的手
He kept waving his hand around like this.

785
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,550
好像他的手中枪了那样？
Like his hand got shot?

786
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,320
我哪知道 看看影片吧
I don't know. Watch the video.

787
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,560
你们看到的不比我少
I mean, you've seen as much as I did.

788
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,570
就是这里
- There! - Yeah.

789
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,760
不像是中枪的样子
It doesn't look like it was shot.

790
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:10,770
嗯
Hmm.

791
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,640
这是枪栓后坐力
No, that is the slide kicking back

792
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,440
划伤了他的手
and cutting his hand

793
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,340
因为他不知道怎么拿枪
because he doesn't know how to hold a gun.

794
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,980
那么嫌疑人是个以前没开枪的人？
So we're looking for a guy who never fired a gun?

795
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,480
没在愤怒时开枪
Well, not in anger.

796
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,680
他现在会了
Well, he has now.

797
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,790
娜塔莎 我们需要你
Natasha, listen, we're gonna need you to

798
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,920
把这段影片保密
keep this video confidential, okay?

799
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,420
不要发在社交媒体上
No posting on social media,

800
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,960
就像你们很多人那样
and all that stuff you guys do.

801
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,990
我几小时以前就发出去了
I uploaded that shit hours ago.

802
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,430
点阅率直接爆表
I'm getting hits like a motherfucker.

803
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,960
好极了
Terrific.

804
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,600
谁想吃面筋
Who wants gluten?

805
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,770
你太残忍了
Oh, man, that's just cruel.

806
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,870
支持一下嘛
A little support.

807
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,170
你知道你想吃熊爪饼
You know you want a bear claw.

808
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,310
是的 我想吃
Hell, yeah, I do.

809
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,370
甜甜圈
Donut hole.

810
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,110
现在是好时节 但对格兰特公园的草坪来说不是这样
It was a good time, but not for the grass in Grant Park

811
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,150
成千上万的参加节日的人
after hundreds of thousands of festival goers

812
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,050
去那里参加洛拉帕罗佐音乐节
romped through the area for Lollapalooza.

813
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,690
据我猜测 格兰特公园的草坪遭受了
It is estimated that there was $300,000 worth of damage

814
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,560
价值30万美元的损失
done to the lawn in Grant Park.

815
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,160
跟往常一样音乐会的主办方
As usual, the concert promoters

816
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,830
要为此买单
are on the hook for paying that bill.

817
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,360
以前的年头更严重 当多雨的季节…
It's been worse in years past, when muddy weather...

818
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,730
哇
Whoa!

819
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,170

822
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,380

this viral video of this guy in a hoodie.

823
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,940
他们把他称作死神
They're calling him the Grim Reaper

824

杀了这些坏人 这些劫车人

825
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,850

according to witnesses. Right or wrong, I don't know.

826
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,620
是善还是恶 我不知道 我一直来回思考
Good or bad, I don't know. I go back and forth on it.

827
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,090
他是英雄还是坏人 这是辩论的主题
Is he a hero or a zero? That's the debate.

828
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,390
我们正接到听众来电
We got calls coming in.

829

数量就像圣诞树上的彩灯
The phones are lit up like a Christmas tree.

830
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,630
我认为这个人…
I say the guy's,

831
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,090
有的人不爱听我这话
and some people are mad at me...

832
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,200
我认为这个人是英雄 他制止了劫车
I say the guy's a hero. He stopped the carjacking.

833
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,400
他确实是英雄
He is a hero.

834
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,530
他是英雄还是坏人
Is he a hero or is he a zero?

835
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,730
你们怎么看

836

838
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,810
他看到有人正被抢劫
He saw somebody about to get jacked,

839
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,610
还是一对黑人夫妻
and a black couple at that?

840
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,980
权力归于死神
Power to the Grim Reaper.

841
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,710
我不这么认为
Yeah, but I don't know about that.

842
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,310
不这么认为
I don't know.

843
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,550
也许我们该把这个问题交给听众
And maybe that's the question we put out to the listeners.

844
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,880
好
Okay.

845
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,050
他动用私刑是正确的？
Is he right for taking the law into his own hands,

846
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,420
还是错误的呢 给我们打电话
or is it wrong? Give us a call.

847
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,590
"摇摆早晨" Shade 45频道

Yeah, I saw that guy earlier today,

849
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,910
不过你该再去看看他
but you should check on him.

850
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,280

I'll check that.

851

我来看看你的伤 可以吗
I'm here to look at your wound. Is that all right?

856
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,930
我有一个发光笔
I have my little flashlight pen.

857
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,670
我来看一下
Let's take a look.

858
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,540
肯定很痛吧
That must've hurt.

859
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,810
你是勒布朗的球迷？
A LeBron fan?

860
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,680
而我
Me?

861
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,480
一直是乔丹的球迷
I'll always be a Jordan guy.

862
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,490
他有魅力 有风格 能空中飞人
He had swagger, he had style, he could fly through the air.

863
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:59,390
但勒布朗也可能是史上最棒的
Still, LeBron might be the best ever.

864
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,360
- 有可能 - 是啊
- Maybe. - Yeah.

865
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,700
你是被误伤？
You got caught in some crossfire?

866
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,170
是冰淇淋男干的
The Ice Cream Man done it.

867
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,900
冰淇淋男？
The Ice Cream Man?

868
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,740
不认他当老大 就无法走路去上学
Can't walk to school if you don't work for him.

869
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,850
是个卖冰淇淋的？
Selling ice cream?

870
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,010
不是
Nah.

871
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,420
他说下次就是我的大腿中枪
He said next time, it ain't gonna be my leg.

872
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:34,860
泰勒 你不会有事的
Tyler, you are gonna be all right.

873
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,700

谢谢
Thanks.

875
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,500
我们等会见 好吗

876
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,010
好
Okay.

877
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,020
- 那个叫塔尼莎的女人 - 怎么了
- The cat, Tanisha. - Word?

878
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,690
好了
Yo, that's it, MUBU.

879
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,330
那女人才是正点 塔尼莎
That's what I'm talkin' about. Yeah, Tanisha.

880
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,170
她的生意高级
That was next level business she was doing.

881
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,210
- 在你的地盘拉皮条？ - 好的
- Pimp out your crib? - That's it.

882
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,410
这样好 谢谢
That's what I'm talking about. Thank you.

883
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,240
带她来我的地盘
Yeah, so, brought her up to my crib,

884
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,480
让他看看照片
show him the picture...

885
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,750
我当然也有
Of course I got mine,

886
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,350
让他看看照片 你会了解的
but show him the picture, you'll see.

887
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,490
- 让我看看那女人 - 喂 看这人
- Let's see that cat, man. - Hey, look here.

888
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:34,760
你就是冰淇淋男？
You're the Ice Cream Man?

889
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,090
你他妈是谁
Who the fuck are you?

890
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,500
是你最后一个顾客
Your last customer.

891
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,730
天啊
Oh, shit!

892
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,710
- 喂 给我 - 让开
- Yo, give me that shit! - Out my way.

893
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,240
他是个白人
He was, uh... He was white.

894
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,880
白人 穿着连帽上衣
A white guy, he had a hoodie...

895
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,710
我只知道这些
And that's all I know.

896
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,410
- 他身高多少 - 谢谢
- Was he tall? Short? - Thanks.

897
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,220
- 体型如何 -他个子不矮
- He was not short. - Fat? Skinny?

898
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,120
他比我高
He was taller than me, you know.

899
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,920
他就这么走这去…
I don't know. He just went over there...

900
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,050
反正就是个白人
He was just some white guy.

901
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,420
我来猜猜 穿着连帽上衣的白人？
Let me guess, white guy with a hoodie?

902
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,920
没错 穿着连帽上衣的白人
Yeah, exactly. White guy with a hoodie.

903
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,060
真扯 9个目击者说的都一样
Fucking bullshit. Nine witnesses, one story.

904
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,760
是死神
The Grim Reaper.

905
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,230
他们说他什么都没抢
They say he didn't take anything.

906
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,900
只是走这去 杀了死者就走了
Just walked up, shot the victim and left.

907
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,900
他叫雷·肖恩·科尔
That's Ray Shawn Core.

908
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,300
多起毒品贩卖和枪击案嫌疑人
Multiple drug offenses suspect and three shootings.

909
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,310
是个地头蛇
- Mmm, real community leader. - Yeah.

910
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,450
你真觉得是同一个人干的？
You really think it's the same shooter?

911
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:34,310
砰 砰 砰
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

912
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,420
砰 砰 砰
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

913
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,560
找出那段影片
Pull up that video.

914
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,460
- 死神的？  - 是的
- Reaper? - Yeah.

915
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,630
- 他用的是哪只手？ - 等等
- What hand does he shoot with? - Hold up.

916
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:58,640
砰 砰 砰
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

917
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,100
芝加哥是不是出了个侠客
Could there be a vigilante in Chicago?

918
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,530
在第二次出手杀了一个地头蛇之后
Rumors are circulating after the second shooting

919
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,030
连日来 各种流言满天飞
of a known criminal in as many days.

920
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,370
警方在寻找这个人
Police are looking for this man,

921
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,310
芝加哥死神
the Chicago Grim Reaper.

922
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,040
根据描述是个30多岁的白人
Described as a white male in his mid to late 30s.

923
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,880
这完全是以漫画书上看到的
This is straight out of a comic book.

924
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,850
这个人变得如此大胆
This dude has gotten so bold.

925
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,150
死神干掉冰淇淋男
Grim Reaper has taken out the Ice Cream Man.

926
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,520
我也想穿上连帽上衣
I might as well get a hoodie and just

927
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,390
开始挺身而出 打击犯罪
start doin' somethin' and fighting crime...

928
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,820
死神不是问题所在
The Grim Reaper isn't part of the problem.

929
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,960
那个冰淇淋男 那个毒贩
The Ice Cream Man, the drug dealer,

930
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,190
才是问题所在
is part of the problem.

931
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,460
你要站在冰淇淋男一边？
You're gonna side with The Ice Cream Man?

932
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,660
有个穿连帽上衣的白人
You got a white guy in a hoodie

933
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,860
在杀黑人
killing black people.

934
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,030
你们对此没意见？
You don't have a problem with that?

935
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,790
他是个毒贩
- This is a drug dealer. - Hmm.

936
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,660
他一直欺压那些
I mean, he's making it hard for the people

937
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,400
住在那一地区的人
that live on that very block.

938
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,230
谁道我们不需要死神这样的人
Don't we need people like this Grim Reaper

939
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,640
来阻止恶人们吗
to keep the monsters at bay?

940
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,970
这是适得其反
It's a slippery slope.

941
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,370
现在很多人
So now everyone's just gonna

942
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,940
都会去私自执法了
take the law into their own hands,

943
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,840
去杀那些他们认为做坏事的人
kill somebody that they think is doing something wrong.

944
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,540
如果你有任何线索
If you have any information,

945
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,380
就拨打这个号码
you're asked to call this number

946
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,720
通知芝加哥警方
and contact the Chicago Police.

947
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,750
我接到很多来自休斯顿、底特律
I'm getting calls from Houston,

948
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,190
和纽约的电话
Detroit, New York.

949
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,690
都担心会引发别人的模仿 进展如何了
Everybody's nervous about a copycat. Where are we?

950
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,660
我们我猜测劫车那次只是偶然的
Well, we assume the carjacking was random.

951
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,760
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

952
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,030
我们的嫌犯
And our subject was just in

953
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,360
只是碰巧遇上了
the wrong place at the wrong time.

954
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,530
但这次让他尝到甜头
- But he got a taste for it. - Mmm-hmm.

955
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,400
所以我们在尽力分析
So we were trying to figure out

956
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,170
他是如何选择的第二个受害人
how he selected the second victim.

957
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,110
那个毒贩
- The drug dealer. - Mmm-hmm.

958
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,510
我们也知道他是左撇子
Oh, we also know he's left-handed.

959
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,010
相信他没有案底
Um, and we're pretty sure he's not in the system.

960
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,680
在第一次枪击后我们就判断了这一点
We figured that out after the first shooting.

961
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,250
他缺少基本的武器使用技能
Um, he had a lack of basic weapon skills.

962
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,580
至少可以这么说
To say the least.

963
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,890
哇 很好
Wow. Great.

964
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,220
你们把嫌疑人的范围缩小到100万人了
You got it narrowed down to about a million suspects.

965
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,960
侦探们 别再坐着了
Detectives, get off your fucking asses!

966
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,760
他火了
He's pissed.

967
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,040
你能不能告诉我
You wanna tell me

968
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,310
我们要去哪里
where we're gonna start looking

969
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,710
开始我们的大海捞针
for our white needle in the haystack?

970
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,040
不是哪里
Not where.

971
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,080
是什么时候
But when.

972
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,420
为什么是现在呢
I mean, why now?

973
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,650
是什么
What, uh...

974
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:24,420
惹毛了死神先生的导火线
Lit the fuse that set off our Mr. Reaper?

975
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,820
你的脸色好多了
You look much better.

976
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,760
谢谢 我的感觉好多了
Thank you. I feel much better.

977
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,100
一直在锻炼？
You exercising?

978
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,560
练俯卧撑

- Joe! - Joe who?

1118
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,400
乔·甘农
Joe Gannon!

1119
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,640
汽车修理店的那个油腻的家伙
The fat greasy fuck at the auto body shop.

1120
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,700
- 乔在哪里 - 我的手机上有
- Where's Joe? - It's in my phone.

1121
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,790
有照片 啥都有 我会带你去找他
It's got pictures, everything. I'll bring you to him.

1122
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,720
蠢货
Stupid motherfuck.

1123
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,980
看着我在接下来所做的事
Watch what I do in the next few seconds.

1124
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,310
你可能会学到
You might learn something

1125
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,250
帮你解决麻烦的办法
that could help you solve your problem.

1126
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,950
拿起这把电钻
Grab this drill.

1127
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,120
我要在这周围
I'm going to drill several holes

1128
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,690
钻几个孔
around this circle right here.

1129
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,960
这样一来
And when I do that,

1130
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,520
这金属盒里的所有资料
the information that's inside of this metal box

1131
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,130
就会很难再被读取了
will be a lot harder to access.

1132
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,170
运气好的话 你的金属盒子
With any luck, your metal box

1133
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,840
会变成这个样子
should now look something like this.

1134
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,880
联邦调查局 中情局 国安局 国际刑警组
Again, FBI, CIA, NSA, Interpol,

1135
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,350
我制作这段影片提供娱乐
this video was strictly made for entertainment purposes.

1136
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,280
别去闯祸 你们这些疯狂的年轻人
Stay out of trouble, you crazy kids.

1137
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,030
早 保罗
Morning, Paul!

1138
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,070
死神来了
Reaper alert!

1139
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,570
死神来了 死神来了
Reaper alert! Reaper alert!

1140
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:02,010
那死神在哪里
Where's the Reaper?

1141
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,510
死神再次出手
The Grim Reaper strikes again.

1142
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,150
这次是在皮尔森地区
This time in the Pilsen neighborhood.

1143
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,810
我正在这家白酒商店前
In front of this liquor store,

1144
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,980
这里也是一处赃物交易的黑市
which was a fencing operation for stolen goods.

1145
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,990
但现在不是了 昨天晚上
Not anymore, when last night,

1146
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,350
死神来拜访了他们
the Grim Reaper paid them a visit.

1147
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,560
我看这去 看到了
Dude, I look over, I see

1148
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,260
一个白人老头走了出来
this dude walking out, this old white dude,

1149
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,820
戴着风帽走出来
and he's walking with his hood up,

1150
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,160
样子很可疑
looking super suspicious.

1151
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,030
就是这样
Just like, you know...

1152
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,760
现在已经把他偶像化了
Kind of idolizing him. Man, right now,

1153
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,360
网络上都是这个人的事蹟
this dude is all over the Internet, man.

1154
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,570
- 还有表情包呢 - 不是吧
- There's memes coming up. - Get outta here.

1155
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,200
是的 有表情包 有人做了表情包
Yeah, there's memes. Like, people are making memes.

1156
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,700
看看这个
Look at this one right here.

1157
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,370
这个太夸张了
Oh, that's too intense.

1158
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:33,540
他成了民间英雄
He's become a folk hero.

1159
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,010
他是这些人真正的英雄
He's a real hero to these people.

1160
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,510
他们一直遭受所在生活区的
They're being affected by all this crime

1161
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,710
犯罪活动的影响
in their neighborhood.

1162
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,050
只要不是在你的生活区
As long as it's not in your neighborhood.

1163
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,080
很显然 他的样子
Clearly, if he didn't just kill somebody,

1164
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,180
就像是刚杀了人
I don't know what he did.

1165
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,420
我依然坚持我的观点
I still stand by my point that

1166
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:47,220
我们是在把一个危险的行为正常化
we're normalizing dangerous behavior.

1167
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,220
我们是不是应该
You know? Should we be policing ourselves

1168
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,560
在我们的生活区维持治安
in our own neighborhoods...

1169
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,290
多年来我一直说我们需要死神这样的人
I have said we need a guy like Grim Reaper for years.

1170
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,860
你是否支持死神
Are you Team Reaper or not?

1171
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,530
请致电"摇摆早晨"
Give us a call. Sway in the Morning

Shade 45频道 天狼星卫星广播公司
at Shade 45, Sirius XM.

1173
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,890
科尔西医生
Dr. Kersey,

1174
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,720
我们是雷恩斯侦探和杰克森侦探
it's Detective Raines and Jackson.

1175
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,320
我们能进去吗
May we come in?

1176
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,890
当然可以 请进
Of course. Come on in.

1177
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,490
你好 很抱歉这么不请自来
How you doing? Sorry to drop in like this.

1178
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,400
不用
Oh, no.

1179
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,960
我们发现了一些情况
Uh, something's come to our attention.

1180
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,330
希望能听听你的看法
We were hoping you could offer some insight.

1181
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,100
很高兴见到你们 请坐
I'm happy to see you guys. Have a seat.

1182
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,770
- 谢谢 - 谢谢
- Thanks. - Thank you.

1183
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,640
好
Okay, um...

1184
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:43,450
你见过这个人吗
Have you ever seen this man?

1185
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
没有
No.

1186
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,980
他是嫌疑人吗
Is he a suspect?

1187
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:54,490
他叫塔特·卡普 绰号小鱼
Well, his name is Tate Karp. He goes by "The Fish."

1188
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:57,420
他是个职业窃贼 我们相信
He's a career burglar and, we believe,

1189
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:59,160
他也参与了你老婆的枪击案
involved in your wife's shooting.

1190
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,100
你们是怎么找到他的
How did you find him?

1191
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:03,160
他是怎么说的
What did he say?

1192
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:06,030
遗憾的是 他昨晚被杀
Well, unfortunately, he was killed last night

1193
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,870
我们没有机会能审问他
before we had a chance to question him.

1194
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:13,010
但我们在犯罪现场发现了这个戒指
But we did find this ring at the crime scene.

1195
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,550
这是我的戒指
That's my ring.

1196
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:22,180
是啊 我们也是这么想的
Yeah. That's what we thought.

1197
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:24,690
但这个戒指
Um, but this right here,

1198
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:26,460
就是我们一直在等待的突破口
it's the break we've been waiting for.

1199
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,490
- 这太好了 - 是啊
- It's great. - Yeah.

1200
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,730
现在我们查到了卡普 我们迟早会
Now that we have Karp, it's just a matter of time

1201
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:33,530
查出他们所有人
before we have the rest of 'em.

1202
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:36,060
我们会查阅他的前科 看他喜欢跟谁合作
We'll run through his priors, see who he liked to work with,

1203
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,230
调阅他的手机纪录 他的讯息
subpoena his cell phone records, his texts.

1204
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,870
甚至是手机的GPS定位
Even the phone's GPS.

1205
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,840
好极了 还有别的需要我帮忙的吗
Great. Do you need anything else from me?

1206
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,640
谢谢了 目前就这些
Appreciate that. I think we're good for now.

1207
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,980
我知道你一直为此事焦虑 我就想
Um... I know you've been frustrated and I wanted to

1208
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,540
亲自来告诉你这个好消息
come by in person to give you the good news.

1209
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:56,050
谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1210
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,920
我跟你说过要抱有信心
I told you to have faith.

1211
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,150
谢谢你抽出时间
Thanks for your time.

1212
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,160
谢谢
Thank you.

1213
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,820
喂 已经打烊了 朋友
Yo, we're closed, pal.

1214

You're Joey, right?

1215
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:09,160
是的 你是谁
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

1216
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,970
喂 白痴 我说了打烊了
Hey, fuckstick, I said we were closed.

1217
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:45,190
怎么了 放开我
What the fuck? Get me the fuck outta here.

1218
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:50,760
操 放开我
Fuck! Get me the fuck outta here, man!

1219
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,570
- 你干什么 - 闭上嘴
- What the fuck are you... - Shut the fuck up.

1220
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,870
你要告诉我想知道的
You're gonna tell me what I wanna hear.

1221
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,210
你不想注射它 但你猜怎么着
You don't want this. But guess what?

1222
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:05,780
会给你注射一些
You'll get some.

1223
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:08,180
我来帮你注射
I'm just gonna help you out.

1224
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,390
相信我 我知道在哪里切开
Trust me, I know where to cut.

1225
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,650
这里…不要动
Now right back here, don't move...

1226
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,360
是你的坐骨神经
...is your sciatic nerve.

1227
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,970
是人体内最长、最强的神经
Longest, strongest nerve in the body.

1228
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,340
操
Fuck!

1229
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:32,340
该死的
God damn!

1230
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,310
你就是那个医生
You're that doctor.

1231
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:38,280
我就是那个医生
I am that doctor.

1232
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,760
但现在我是你的医生
But right now, I'm your doctor.

1233
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,800
你的朋友小鱼已经死了
Your friend, Fish, is already dead.

1234
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,770
你可以感谢他把你供了出来
You can thank him for giving you up.

1235
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,870
不 不 不
No. No, no, no, no.

1236
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:51,880
现在我想知道 还有谁去这我家
What I want to know is who else was there.

1237
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:53,710
没别人
Nobody.

1238
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:54,950
还有谁去这
Who else was there?

1239
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:55,950
没别人
No one, man.

1240
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:05,550
你感觉到的 是腐蚀性物质
What you're feeling is a caustic agent

1241
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,620
直接作用于神经上
being applied directly to a nerve.

1242
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,930
在医学院 我们学到
In med school, we were taught that

1243
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,730
这是一个人能忍受的
this is the most painful experience

1244
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:15,970
最大疼痛体验
that a person can endure

1245
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,270
又不至于引发心跳停止
without possibly going into cardiac arrest.

1246
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:20,770
请住手 好痛
Please stop. It hurts.

1247
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,570
坏消息是
The bad news is

1248
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:25,170
你这里有好多瓶刹车油
you've got a shit ton of brake fluid here.

1249
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:28,010
所以我们要在这里玩上一整夜
So we might be here all night.

1250
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,980
你到底说还是不说
Now you're gonna start talking, aren't ya?

1251
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,820
诺克斯 他叫诺克斯
Knox! That's his name. Knox!

1252
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,750
诺克斯 他的全名是什么
Knox. What's his full name?

1253
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:37,620
别的我都不知道
I don't know anything else, man!

1254
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,990
他叫诺克斯 他来自南区

1257

No.

1270
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,140
杀你的是千斤项

1271
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,380
漂亮的击球
Damn. Hell of a swing.

1272
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,250
还是左撇子呢
Lefty, no less.

1273
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,590
嗨 法兰克
Hey, Frank.

1274
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,250
我问你的长官
You know, when I asked your supervisor

1275
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,320
你下班后常去哪里玩
where you like to hang out after work,

1276
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,860
他说是这里
he told me here.

1277
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,180
我还以为他忽悠我
I thought he was jerking my chain.

1278
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,430
后来我查了一下你
Then I looked you up.

1279
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:56,070
你曾是个新秀
You were a legitimate prospect.

1280
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,430
怎么不打球了
What happened?

1281
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,100
你们想要我签名？
So you want my autograph?

1282
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,000
我们只想谈谈
We just wanna talk.

1283
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,340
好的
All right.

1284
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:05,280
你听说过人们最近谈论的
Have you heard of this Grim Reaper fellow

1285
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,380
这个死神吗
that people are talking about?

1286
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,610
是的 我听说过
Yeah, yeah. I heard about it.

1287
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,350
他昨晚去了一家酒品店
Well, last night, he went into a liquor store.

1288
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:14,420
杀了闯入你哥家里的
And he killed one of the three men

1289
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,880
三个人之一
that broke into your brother's house.

1290
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:19,720
交通监视器拍到他进出那里 白人 健壮
Traffic cam caught him walking in and out. White, fit...

1291
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,560

- Lefty. - Lefty. Yeah. He's a lefty.

1292
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,630
然后我就问自己：
So I ask myself, you know,

1293
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:27,530
我认识哪个道上的左撇子？
"What streetwise lefty do I know?"

1294
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:28,930
那种能到处放话
You know, the kind of guy that could

1295
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:31,800
重金征求线索

1296
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,470
会想杀了我们的嫌疑人
Would want to execute our suspects.

1297
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:38,710
那种喜欢亲力亲为的人
A real do-it-himself kind of guy.

1298
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:41,580
那么你们觉得这事跟我有关
So you think I had something to do with it, huh?

1299
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,950
你们该问问我哥
Well, you should talk to my brother.

1300
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:46,120
他会告诉你我不会出钱买任何东西
He'll tell you that I don't pay for shit.

1301
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,050
当然 能让我们看看你的手吗
Of course. So, do you mind if we see your hands?

1302
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,330
喂
Hey!

1303
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,830

1304
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,140

1306
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:11,340

1307
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:12,910
警方认为此人是模仿
Police believe this was a copycat

1308
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:15,140
所谓的"芝加哥死神"

1309
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:17,180
他出去试图打击犯罪
A guy who went out, tried to fight crime,

1310
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,280
最后却成了犯罪的受害人
and ended up a victim himself.

1311
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,880
警方依然在寻找枪手
Police are still looking for the shooter.

1312
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:35,790
马上接电话 否则我就告诉警察你昨晚去了哪里
Answer now or I'll tell the cops where you were last night

我听说你在找我
I hear you're looking for me.

1315
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:51,850
是的
That's right.

1316
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:54,950
到Blowout来 在阿什兰的一家夜店

I'll be waiting.

1318
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,990
我为何会去呢
Why would I do that?

1319
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:00,360
因为去那里安全 是公共场所

而且我想告诉你你老婆的遗言是什么

1322

Get out.

1331
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:43,250

1332
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,820
- 怎么了 - 我们这就去

市区一家夜店发生交火

有任何来治疗枪伤的
Any gunshot wound being treated,

1338
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:00,170
40或50多岁的男性 就给我们打电话
a male, 40s or 50s, give us a call!

1339
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,070
具里报告说 他们没有
County reports they have no one

1340
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,840
符合对枪手描述的人

你能描述一下他的样子吗
Can you describe him to us?

1348
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,250
操
Fuck!

1349
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,010
打开

1350
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,970
保罗 你要把我也杀了？

我来这里干什么？你来这里干什么

1358
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:34,980
总要有人做些什么

1359

我的老婆女儿就这么没了
My wife and daughter just disappear.

1360
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,720
却没人得到惩罚

1361
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,060
该做的一切我都做了
I did everything I was supposed to do.

让我的家人 让我的老婆和女儿过上了好日子
I made a life for my family. For my wife and daughter!

1365
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:59,170
然后呢 就这么算了？
And what? Just forget about that?

1366
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,110
她们就这么没了？
They're just gone now?

1367
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,280
你现在快走 法兰克
You need to leave now, Frank.

1368
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,520
我不想让你扯上牵连
I don't want you to be part of this.

1369
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,660
不 喂 我已经扯上牵连了
No. Hey, hey. I'm already a part of this.

1370
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,100
留在这里
Stay, stay.

1371
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,680
这不是芝加哥警方吗
If it isn't Chicago's finest.

1372
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,010
你好 法兰克
Hello, Frank.

1373
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,710
我们以为会是你哥
We were expecting your brother.

1374
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:42,650
他出门了 有个聚会 什么事
Yeah, he's out. Dinner party. Why, what's up?

1375
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:45,120
他可能惹上大麻烦了
Well, he could be in real trouble.

1376
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,290
你可能不信 我们是想帮他
Believe or not, we wanna help.

1377
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:53,400
太客气了 我感谢你的关心 侦探
That's so sweet. I appreciate your concern, Detective.

1378
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,730
就像我说的 看到他的时候我会告诉他的
Like I said, when I see him, I'll tell him.

1379
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,870
他在鬼扯
That was some bullshit.

1380
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,170
他肯定在家
He's in there.

1381
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:06,570
但没有铁证的话
But we're not arresting the surgeon

1382
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,410
我们不能逮捕外科医生
without an ironclad proof.

1383
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:16,020
好消息是我不再是嫌疑犯了
Well, the good news is I'm not a suspect anymore.

1384
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:19,160
坏消息是 我不再是嫌疑犯了
The bad news is I'm not a suspect anymore.

1385
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,360
保罗 这事必须结束
Paul, this has to end.

1386
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:25,530
必须结束
It's gotta end, man.

1387
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,360
我可不想把你埋在你老婆旁边
I don't wanna have to bury you next to your wife.

1388
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,030
你不会埋我
You're not gonna bury me.

1389
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:31,600
我们必须想办法
All right. We gotta figure this out

1390
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,440
如果有什么警方能查出来的
if you think there's anything the cops can find.

1391
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,870
那家夜店里有监视器
