1
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:30,338
We will drown!
We have to go now!

2
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,841
five more minutes!

3
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,810
There

4
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,159
I found it!
Finally I found it

5
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,161
All right, let's get out of here!

6
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:19,516
Did you see that?
I said it would be here,

7
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:22,530
We've broken the deal.

8
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,056
Well, the deal is an agreement,

9
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,665
Oh, wow.

10
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:34,206
You are very generous, Mr. "Rackham".

11
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,108
Yes?

12
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,320
Enjoy it

13
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,240
Yes? What?

14
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,677
What would you do
What are you doing, man?

15
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,953
No, let me go!
No, no!

16
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:49,746
No, no

17
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,069
<b> <i> The lost traveler and the mystery of King Midas </ b> </ i>

18
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,394
Time to study,

19
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:27,200
Herodotus is considered as
Mr history,

20
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,160
Cool ... Super Cookie,

21
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:31,063
This guy is great,

22
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:34,416
Hey, why are you really serious about those books?

23
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:36,686
I know ya, first year
lectures in archeology ...

24
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:38,438
It takes a lot of reading,

25
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:42,210
I do not understand what makes you so interested in these old things.

26
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,928
- Now I understand, -
this is really new to learn,

27
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,039
- Beautiful!
- Hey, do not talk about Sarah like that.

28
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,709
Do not start again, nothing
who believes you know him

29
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,331
Actually, we even kissed

30
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,054
- But, just once,
Oh, and here it is again,

31
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:59,614
But we are separated from each other afterwards

32
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:02,874
He has gone on assignment
the long and the long.

33
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,556
And I study college again and work ....

34
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:06,673
Other things are unchanging,

35
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:09,326
Oh yeah, you've kissed this girl?

36
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,495
But even though the distance is very far
I feel it here ...

37
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,707
Close to my heart,
I felt trembled,

38
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,460
I really feel it vibrating.

39
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:20,879
Oh, this is fun!

40
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,506
Yes, this is a call from Scarlett Johansson

41
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,400
- Hey, be careful!
- sorry,

42
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,594
Tad, you must try life to receive
reality and change,

43
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,513
Sa ... Sara?

44
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:33,516
Tad, I hope I'm not bothering you,

45
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,268
No, not at all!

46
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:40,148
Hey, I've seen you on the cover
"National Petrography,

47
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,375
Beautiful, right?

48
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,939
Do you have an invitation to attend the exhibition?

49
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:45,896
Yes, I wish I was already there,

50
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:47,112
Amazing,

51
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,060
I want to meet you

52
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,451
I also

53
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:54,988
The exhibition was held at Jl
Hotel Luxorius in Las Vegas,

54
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,394
Do you know the way?

55
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:58,080
Hey I'll find a pen,

56
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,588
- Where are you going
- What?

57
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,057
No where else, I'm still here,

58
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,958
No, I meant you were not ...

59
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:10,303
Sorry, my fault!

60
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,080
Do you want to hang up the phone first?

61
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,581
- stop there
- Well okay, I will not
hang up,

62
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:19,062
No, wait

63
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:20,466
Are you good

64
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,666
Yes yes, the Luxorius Hotel,

65
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,944
Yes, take highway 290 to cover 50 km.

66
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,071
Highway 290, 50 km,

67
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,986
Turn second turn left,

68
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,426
All right, then straight ahead

69
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:34,807
Until you reach a pyramid-shaped hotel

70
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:36,978
Do not let it come

71
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,885
A pyramid-shaped hotel, yes,
I understand ... can not!

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,675
What? Do you understand or not?

73
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,886
See you later, Sara!

74
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,596
Tad?

75
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,948
Ah ho ho ... almost,

76
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:18,246
Sorry, you good sir?

77
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:21,207
Tad Jones, you're fired ...!

78
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,756
Oh, my luck talisman perfume.

79
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:26,254
This smell, my Indy hats,

80
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:29,758
My elegant tuxedo coat
And tie.

81
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:34,179
Two new shirts, T-shirts
feet, panties,

82
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,056
I think that's it,

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,935
Do you think he'll like it, Jeff?

84
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,430
Jeff!

85
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,942
Ready Jeff?
Let's go to see Sarah,

86
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,681
Sir, are you okay

87
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:53,740
Water!

88
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,248
Water, water!

89
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,958
You?

90
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,056
I need water!

91
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,503
That is you

92
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:09,013
I did not drink for 20 days,

93
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,884
No, no, no, stop, no!
This is disgusting ....

94
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:17,765
You can not imagine, the difficulty of my journey to meet you

95
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:22,078
- Nice to meet you again!
- This is impossible, what are you doing here?

96
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,478
Oh, this is a long story,

97
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,648
I prefer not to tell you,
but, i will say ..

98
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,150
When you leave town, I am taken to court.

99
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:32,362
The city council accused me of allowing you
Escape and have alienated Me,

100
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,365
- are they kicking you out
- Yes, because of you,

101
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:38,698
Well, because the lawyers are bad
But this is a different story.

102
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,989
The truth is, I have to say
goodbye to my house,

103
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:45,542
I travel the furthest
during my life

104
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:48,447
He got lost in the desert, moment
he followed the strange line

105
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:50,972
I do not know what to do...

106
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,648
Then I remember, my only friend.

107
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,696
- Friends?
- You are right

108
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,263
We are more like brothers,

109
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:01,221
Please
Can you control this little animal?

110
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:02,506
Jeff, come here,

111
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:05,258
All right, I'm sorry, but I'm leaving

112
00:09:05,324 --> 00:09:07,004
Oh, but I just came,

113
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,032
I went to Las Vegas to see Sarah,

114
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,510
Sara? My Sara?
Oh, I miss him so much!

115
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,895
What are you waiting for

116
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,499
No, no, no ... you did not go.

117
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:17,998
- Yes
- no

118
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,432
- Yes!
- no!

119
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,745
YES !!!

120
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:26,041
Yu Yu, I am the king of the world!

121
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:29,892
Hey, come back here!

122
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,533
Can you sit down and stop
Draw attention?

123
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:37,256
- What is wrong with you
- Listen, you're a mummy,

124
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,813
Scary for people, in the world
this you are a zombie.

125
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:41,475
Zombie!

126
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:44,209
It sounds good
I love this name,

127
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,511
Well, be quiet now,

128
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:48,175
Well, I'm sorry I understand.

129
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,457
I will not move a bit, look.

130
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,154
Oh, what's this?

131
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:56,743
Oh, oh my God, this is a necklace!

132
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,571
- is that for me? thank you
- Not for you

133
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,037
I said it was not for you,

134
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:07,068
Oh very good!

135
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,209
Yes, this is for Sara,

136
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,169
I know it
Tell me everything

137
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,028
I'm an expert in love relationships,

138
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:17,649
Over 500 years experience
I know everything about women,

139
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:20,554
Hi.

140
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,849
What did you see?
It's a real heartbreaker.

141
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:27,705
Well,

142
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:32,581
I'll ask her to be my girlfriend.

143
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:36,907
Oh, I do not know how to tell you about this Tad ..

144
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,906
But maybe, you do not look like her class

145
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:43,159
You know, as if you were swimming against the tide.

146
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,133
He's famous and cool, and you're a loser.

147
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:46,741
She is beautiful you do not.

148
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:52,886
- He's too good for you
- Thanks for all these motivations, buddy
- Thank you brothers

149
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:05,640
Nice

150
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:07,559
What is "beautiful"?

151
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,870
People say that if they really like something

152
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,342
Something very impressive

153
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:14,958
I understand
Like Machu Picchu,

154
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,323
The Limastad Pyramid
Lake Titicaca,

155
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:20,274
Yes, yes, that's it, you have to
stay in car now ...

156
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,298
And never
move, you understand?

157
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:23,735
Ah!

158
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:30,912
WAAO !!!!!

159
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:32,935
Look at this, Jeff!

160
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,503
Mr. Stones?

161
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,456
Hi, I'm Tiffany Midson.

162
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,292
Assistant Professor Lavrov,

163
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:41,670
Hi, Nice to meet you,

164
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,530
Oh, that cute little dog!

165
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:47,057
Who is a good dog?
Give me a pat

166
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:52,500
Sorry, he's not very easy to connect
with new people.

167
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,186
Bu Lavrov asked me to look after you.

168
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,309
I prepared my thesis on his latest invention,

169
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:03,542
Good Do you study archeology too?

170
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,975
Boston University
next year is over

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,591
Chicago
But I just started,

172
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,439
Compared to Sarah,

173
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,422
This is amazing.

174
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,187
I learned a lot from them,

175
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:18,672
So fabulous
To what extent have you achieved now.

176
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,924
The most important archaeologists today,

177
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:23,334
I give everything to be like him.

178
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:29,191
Come on Sara wait for you,

179
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:38,567
The statue there,
armor over there,

180
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:40,277
Watch Out

181
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,706
Hi, Belzoni!

182
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:45,094
How are you
small bird

183
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,122
They are good friends

184
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,585
Tad, you're here

185
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,723
Sara!

186
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:03,083
Saaaarrerraaa!

187
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:09,643
How glad I met you again.

188
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:12,674
Stupid.

189
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:16,864
Come on, let me show you
the show, you'll love it.

190
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,057
Nice!

191
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:30,493
Nice!

192
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,418
Nice! Nice! Nice!

193
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,218
Nice!

194
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,142
Yes?

195
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:00,724
Hi

196
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,532
Nice!

197
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,653
Oh man!

198
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,164
King Papyrus "Midas"!

199
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,917
Can you read the writing?

200
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:21,695
Made in ... China?

201
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,381
His Papyrus manuscript, not his pigura,

202
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:27,425
Yes ... sorry for my mistake

203
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:30,570
They look like hieroglyphs,

204
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:31,713
Right,

205
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:35,013
This is where I work so far.

206
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:38,673
The magical Pendant "King Midas" consists of three pieces,

207
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:42,066
One of them can be found at
Red Temple, Pal,

208
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,149
I found this hieroglyph ...

209
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,960
See the exact location
From the temple,

210
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:49,090
If the pendant really does exist ...

211
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,324
So does Midas gold touch.

212
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,912
Ability to change everything
be gold with touch,

213
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,210
Tad, I've been very busy for this ...

214
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,680
Sara, ah ...

215
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:06,155
I...

216
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:08,248
I have something to do
I asked you.

217
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:11,177
Yes, talk

218
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,555
Would you be...

219
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:15,765
Being ...?

220
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:17,334
Mummy?!

221
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:18,527
Your mummy?

222
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:20,404
- Sarah!
- You?

223
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,274
Come here, give me a hug!

224
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,580
I've told you to wait in the car!

225
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:26,440
But what are you doing here?

226
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:29,358
Oh, I better not tell you,
well, I'll tell you,

227
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,469
You know, when you go
From The Lost City ...

228
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:33,818
All right, I'll tell him later,

229
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,945
Bu Lavrov?
The show for tonight,

230
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,782
What happened to Elvis?

231
00:15:38,986 --> 00:15:40,586
He was an old friend,

232
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,221
- Right, mummy?
- Hello!

233
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:43,735
Did you call him a mummy?

234
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:47,130
- Yes, he does not matter,
- Hey ?!

235
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:50,133
Please excuse me
I still have a lot to do,

236
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,850
Oh, yes, do not worry, come on

237
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,430
Goodbye Goodbye, Sarah!

238
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,568
Why are you wearing this?

239
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,793
I understand why
you love him so much,

240
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,836
This is great for you

241
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:14,282
Come on,

242
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:36,250
- All right, Elvis, see you later,
- Yeah, let's go to the party!

243
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:38,173
You can not stay here

244
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,533
What? You leave me alone again?

245
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,203
Only until Sara's presentation ended

246
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:45,272
I do not want
there is a problem, I understand?

247
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,985
All right, I'll stay here
But on one condition,

248
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,271
Condition?

249
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,883
Bring this dog with you.

250
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:55,907
Come here, Jeff.

251
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,852
Do not leave the room, okay?

252
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,501
Not good

253
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:20,974
Hi. Nice to meet you...

254
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,184
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you...

255
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:25,186
Hi, my name is Tad,

256
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:27,231
What is my fault yes, do I speak the language
wrong?

257
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:30,517
Hey, Belzoni, nice to meet you!

258
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:36,082
Waiter?
What do you mean

259
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,453
Not really
This is my favorite.

260
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,333
Woohoo ...

261
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,659
I'll take care of this, sir

262
00:17:58,179 --> 00:17:59,721
Keep watching him

263
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:14,914
Old manuscripts

264
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:18,248
Unraveling the true story of King "Midas",

265
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:21,551
This is the Papyrus, known as
"Sacrifice for Love".

266
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:25,096
God chose him as the legendary king, defeating all his opponents.

267
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:27,332
dedicating his victory to the god Apollo ...

268
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,521
In return, Apollo gave Midas
Magic necklace

269
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,213
Necklace with three pieces of gold,

270
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:36,716
The necklace gives strength
for the wearer ...

271
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:40,345
Ability to change
all that is touched to gold,

272
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:44,140
Midas collects
ton by ton gold,

273
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:47,269
Everything he touched his hands turned into gold

274
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,895
But this golden touch ...

275
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,919
It soon became a curse,

276
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:53,216
Her daughter wanted to hug her,

277
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,902
He turned into gold

278
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:59,692
Desperate, Midas returns to Apollo
and ask for mercy

279
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:03,163
Apollo says Midas must release his necklace.

280
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:05,820
and presented the three golden pendulum.

281
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,267
To God in different parts of the world ...

282
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,126
Midas carries out all the Apollo messages

283
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,587
Abstinence surrendered and with
tremendous power,

284
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,238
In order to bring her daughter back to life,

285
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,054
In other words,

286
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,318
Sacrifice for love,

287
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:22,178
Wow!

288
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,211
Ladies and gentlemen,

289
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:34,091
This is my honor
To show my greatest discovery,

290
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:39,354
Conclusive evidence,
that thousands of years ago ...

291
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,866
the legend of King Midas and his necklace,
there really is

292
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:44,576
Gift?

293
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:48,046
Papyrus Midas,

294
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:06,723
It's the party!

295
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:19,736
We can, boss,

296
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,406
- Go away, Belzoni!
- catch him!

297
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,665
Oh oh...

298
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,591
- You
- Hey, thanks,

299
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,613
- could!
- No, I can!

300
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,333
TAD!

301
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:50,344
You will come with me

302
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,415
Keep your hands away from me!

303
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:00,189
Sarah ...

304
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:10,545
- Tad!
- Sarah!

305
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:14,267
Find me!

306
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,634
No!

307
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,319
Sarah ...

308
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:34,396
Get up, Tad

309
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,432
Find me

310
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,103
TAD

311
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,087
Come back to me

312
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,469
Tad, Bangun, Tad,

313
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:48,653
Wait, where's Sarah?
They kidnapped her,

314
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:51,079
He was kidnapped as
"Pizarro" "Atahualpa"

315
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:53,898
Like Curtis and Moctizuma as
Juanita Mo ... ,,,,,

316
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:55,792
Tad, are you okay?

317
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:58,154
Yes, the blow was not much,

318
00:22:58,775 --> 00:22:59,788
Wait a minute,

319
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:02,827
Sarah's notebook, she wanted to give it to me.

320
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:07,070
I think criminals have picked it up
and asks Sara to show the necklace of King Midas,

321
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:09,770
Yes we have to find it first.

322
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:13,613
With this, we can go one step further
and save Sara,

323
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:14,938
Look at this,

324
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,621
Red Temple Pal

325
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:19,563
Sarah was sure this was Midas's first stop
to start his journey.

326
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:22,360
Lock location
In this hieroglyph,

327
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,901
But I can not describe it,

328
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:28,692
Let me see, I'll try something
To find Tetrazaya,

329
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,070
Right, and we have to know too
their dialect,

330
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:32,190
Great idea

331
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:36,602
Oh,

332
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,615
Almost no reference
For this ancient language,

333
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:40,849
Dead end

334
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,831
There must be a way,

335
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:47,136
And then you will find Baal,

336
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:49,347
What did you just say?

337
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:54,461
- No, no, nothing else
- Ah,

338
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:58,680
Language translation!
How can you read?

339
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:01,742
Well, this dead language is
my expertise, look.

340
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:05,098
Did you see that?
Truly fluent tongue, ha ha ..

341
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,650
Your friend is a bit weird,

342
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,764
Oh, you can not imagine it,

343
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:11,406
Here he says: Four Suns ...

344
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:14,654
Horseback riding, from, sitvilla,

345
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,725
There you will find hubby,

346
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,310
Setefilla,

347
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:23,907
Sorry, my friend

348
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:29,076
Sitifilla is what is called Tartesus
City of Sevilla,

349
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:31,135
Four, sun, opposite, sunrise,

350
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,523
Of course one sun means
One day in ancient times,

351
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:35,154
Horseback riding...

352
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:37,738
About 250 kilometers,

353
00:24:38,803 --> 00:24:41,054
250 kilometers to the dawn,

354
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:42,787
To the east,

355
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,854
Granada, the Red Temple.
For "Pal" in Granada,

356
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:51,051
That is, Tad, there is the Alhambra,

357
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:53,810
Islamic Fort
Also known as La Roja,

358
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:55,348
They took Sarah there,

359
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:59,953
Get ready friends,
we will go to Spain,

360
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:03,228
- Spanish, uh, uh, -
we will come, "Midas".

361
00:25:03,855 --> 00:25:07,816
Be patient Sara, Tad
Stone will solve this case,

362
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:14,191
For the last,

363
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:17,946
How can I use this?
To search for "Midas" necklace.

364
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:19,789
I will not tell you anything,

365
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:24,624
I left it, there is another way
Forcing them to work more together

366
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,887
Are you sure you want to use the truth serum?
This serum may be expired

367
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:35,594
Well, there is only one way
To find out,

368
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,307
What do you think

369
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,887
I pack, ... ,,,,,,

370
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,497
Come on, do not be shy,

371
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:48,315
No, I can not, you ...

372
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:52,694
You are a dictator, stupid
Murahan,

373
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:53,866
I am sorry

374
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:55,341
Do not you dare!

375
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:57,283
You are also spoiled child!

376
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:01,966
And your feet smell.

377
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:06,917
Your turn

378
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:12,380
Where are the pieces of the necklaces?

379
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:15,717
I will not tell you anything,

380
00:26:15,997 --> 00:26:18,574
Do not refuse, you want to tell me.

381
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:20,722
No ... my head,

382
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,536
- Midas ...
- that's right .. where the location of the piece,

383
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:27,809
Everything in the notebook,

384
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:30,899
Tad, Tad,

385
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:32,955
What happened

386
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:34,978
I think the dosage is too high, sir,

387
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,946
Idiot,

388
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,631
Who was Tad this girl called?

389
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:40,449
I think that's the man
the big nose,

390
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:42,479
I want that notebook,

391
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,104
Find the fool Tad.

392
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:55,582
What?

393
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,066
you can sing softer and
Do not draw attention?

394
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,626
Are you jealous in my soft voice?

395
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:07,423
We need to find you undercover
better,

396
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:10,187
What are you talking about, I look great.

397
00:27:10,857 --> 00:27:13,934
So where do we go?
Beautiful, beautiful ...

398
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:18,283
Oh, look, there's good food in Spain,

399
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,488
do you like it

400
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:25,861
Good, good
Tad, who is Antonio Banderas?

401
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:38,153
I can not believe we are headed for this great discovery,

402
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:41,440
- We can write history,
- Yes, but it will not be easy,

403
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:45,081
We have to solve this
To find the Temple of Baal,

404
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,126
"The match has been stolen again,"

405
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:48,294
Taxi.

406
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:50,245
To go to Alhambra?

407
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,457
Of course my friend
Come here

408
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:53,415
thank you

409
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:55,726
Wait a minute, where's the mummy?

410
00:27:55,785 --> 00:27:58,570
He went looking for the right clothes

411
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,781
The right clothes?
How do you know what ... ,,,,?

412
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:06,908
I do not believe,

413
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,076
I do not believe,

414
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:13,877
I can not believe someone can look that way
Looks great.

415
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,809
Geez, Geez, Geez

416
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:35,101
That's the most beautiful elegance
that I've seen

417
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,998
Oh very good,

418
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,461
Are you happy now?

419
00:28:38,486 --> 00:28:42,073
I hope you do not say it again
I draw attention

420
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:49,246
I want to take you to the end of the world if you ask for it,

421
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,547
Now just take us
To Al Hamra Palace,

422
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:53,554
Well, we can go there too,

423
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:57,861
Let's go,

424
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,988
They have notebooks,
sir, what is your command,

425
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:08,515
Seize the book from the clown's hand,

426
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,562
do it...

427
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:12,602
Please do not hurt Tad,

428
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:16,228
Do not worry, I will not let it
they suffered so much,

429
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:18,929
- I try, - wealth?

430
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,328
All this for the sake of wealth?

431
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:24,881
This is very naive,

432
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:26,427
No,

433
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,523
Midas strength can be more than that, dear ..

434
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:33,547
What is this

435
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:37,135
Something I bought from
An antique dealer

436
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:40,171
Midas Strength ...

437
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:42,808
Is the power of the gods,

438
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:46,185
The ability to control the world,

439
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:51,242
And this will be mine,

440
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:57,188
Hi beauty .. I do not think
you are from this world,

441
00:29:57,354 --> 00:30:00,600
Actually, I'm not from
this world, the story is ...

442
00:30:00,706 --> 00:30:02,749
- So I...
- I am quiet.

443
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,317
Hey, do you know the people behind us?

444
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:14,416
Oh no, we have a problem,

445
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:16,463
Dear God .. we are in danger,

446
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,955
Calm, beauty,

447
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:20,681
I swear it will not happen to you
As long as there is me,

448
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:32,784
Oh, they are getting closer.

449
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:34,590
They wanted a notebook,

450
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:39,414
Oh, nice souvenirs,

451
00:30:39,652 --> 00:30:41,111
Not for you

452
00:30:42,485 --> 00:30:45,779
- Hey, but why throw it away?
- Please help me,

453
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:49,858
Well, I understand, I understand,
let's start with that.

454
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:55,747
Yes,

455
00:30:57,976 --> 00:31:00,019
- Hello, "
- Oh hai,

456
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:07,676
Watch Out

457
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,285
Quickly open the car's lid,

458
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,323
Oliy,

459
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:35,366
Jeff,

460
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:38,582
Stop, stop, stop, we will not survive.

461
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,806
Party time ..

462
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:46,831
- Nam, - Tad!

463
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:49,092
Okay, Tiv, do not worry

464
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,520
- Move!
- Watch Out!

465
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:03,670
What is this?

466
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:19,932
- see
- What?

467
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:21,458
Bridge

468
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,829
oww

469
00:32:37,183 --> 00:32:38,642
Nice!

470
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:51,300
Come on, let's go
Before they returned,

471
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:54,335
Oh, this is the party the guide says

472
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:09,458
Somewhere here, Midas left the first pendulum from his necklace,

473
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,223
Oh, look at the color

474
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:13,602
Look at the sun, and look at this light

475
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:16,424
Oh, how I miss my mummy city,

476
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:28,809
According to legend, Apollo gave
Midas a good lesson,

477
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:29,947
What?

478
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:33,363
Your wealth is not more important
than the one you love

479
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,203
More importantly, sacrifice for love.

480
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:37,403
That is

481
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:51,331
I'm afraid we do not get the records, sir.

482
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:54,590
- Did the idiot run away?
- He's a genius Sir,

483
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:57,179
Clever the highest level.
total professionals.

484
00:33:57,522 --> 00:33:59,915
Genius, really?

485
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:01,704
total professionals.

486
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,408
I do not care,

487
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,214
I want that notebook, understand?

488
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:10,007
Yes sir, my notebook or my life,

489
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:19,117
Wait a minute, this looks familiar

490
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,360
Tiv, look at this,

491
00:34:21,836 --> 00:34:23,379
the picture looks like a fountain,

492
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:26,389
There is a description

493
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,998
Centuries after entering the Temple of Midas Baal.

494
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:32,172
The Sultan protects himself
With 12 animals,

495
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:34,304
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

496
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:36,888
Twelve black, must be here,

497
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:40,263
There should be a crane or something,

498
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,822
We need bulldozers
To get rid of this,

499
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:56,488
TAD, it moves

500
00:34:58,211 --> 00:34:59,587
Hey, Tiv, look

501
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,299
There is a sign here,

502
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,770
It also has a sign,

503
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:07,557
It can spin.

504
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:10,619
Good, let's turn it all
the head of a lion with a sign

505
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,569
Tad .. that's wrong,

506
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:23,643
It would be better if you
rotate from the other side,

507
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:25,652
It would be better if you intervene

508
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:29,071
Funny, very funny

509
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:31,642
Help me this one Tiv

510
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,802
Come on,

511
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:52,878
We succeeded ... ha ha ...

512
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,719
Sorry, this is something I do if ...

513
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:05,815
You do not have respect for yourself, do you?

514
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,948
Maybe my cousin was there

515
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:12,573
Belzoni, wait here
and watch Jeff,

516
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,167
I do not care

517
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,421
Be careful, buddy
It's slick here,

518
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:31,041
The smell

519
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,842
What's this sound?

520
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,075
Ah, that rat!

521
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,461
I hate them, hate that rat!

522
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:51,527
can you stop screaming?
you scare them,

523
00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:54,636
What's wrong with them?
They are very funny

524
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:57,445
Oh, I feel at home,

525
00:36:57,668 --> 00:36:59,472
You are disgusting

526
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,183
Friends, this is a maze.

527
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:03,239
It will last a long time
To find a way out,

528
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:05,410
Just a moment, ask the way,

529
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:07,868
Ask who

530
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,886
What do you think?
Ask him

531
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:27,764
Do you know where the Baal Temple is?

532
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,218
Sorry, I forgot to tell you
The rat is a bit retarded,

533
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:37,050
Are you crazy?
You really hope in that rat ...?

534
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,909
You know where it is
Temple of Baal?

535
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:43,572
Where is Baal Temple?

536
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:48,358
- Temple.
- K-U-I-L
- Temple.

537
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,542
Tiieeeeeett .....

538
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:58,044
Let's go,

539
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:00,012
Stupid mouse

540
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,519
Will we follow rats?
Correct

541
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,349
Hello my little bird

542
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:18,244
Hey, you too
Lead us to your friends ...

543
00:38:18,455 --> 00:38:20,582
Or we'll kill this furry friend

544
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,903
Go here

545
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:46,885
Ha, ha, this is a good joke.

546
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:49,554
This rat is amazing,

547
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:56,847
Okay, I understand

548
00:38:56,888 --> 00:38:59,450
Thank you very much my friend
my little one, see you later,

549
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:02,509
Well now, what?

550
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,699
He says that we have to get through it,

551
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,165
- Are you a veranda?
- This is what rats say.

552
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:13,536
Come on our friends not so far
for futility

553
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:17,010
you look like a mouse!

554
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:31,904
The book was true, the Spanish food is outstanding

555
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:36,982
It's safe here, come on,

556
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:43,547
Who says archeology is not fun?

557
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,033
That's not so bad

558
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:14,120
- "Baal"
- We're here,

559
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:20,096
I told you, the rat was right.
The rat was right!

560
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,039
Hey, look,

561
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:30,546
Tread of gold,

562
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,312
Midas was once here,

563
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:44,994
Part of the necklace "Midas".

564
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:10,779
Friends let's get out of here
This place is very creepy

565
00:41:13,942 --> 00:41:15,442
No, no,

566
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,831
Oh, let me pray to Mama Pacha. .

567
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:23,149
Oh God of the earth, please help us in this difficult time.

568
00:41:23,973 --> 00:41:25,932
Oh, I do not think he's listening,

569
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:38,723
Maybe he's listening.

570
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,005
The room was a trap,

571
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:49,950
- We have to get out
from here, - wait.

572
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,494
Water must seep into a place,

573
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,873
TAD. I will not last longer!

574
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,921
I found my way out,
help me.

575
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,656
I'm fine, if nobody asks about it.

576
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:33,325
Forgive me my friend, I'll draw you
your other friends

577
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:40,661
- We did it!
- Tad!

578
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:43,287
- Yes! We made it!
- We have succeeded ...

579
00:43:43,312 --> 00:43:45,688
Congratulations to two happy people,

580
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,435
Tiffany?

581
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:56,357
Tad ...?

582
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:57,372
Sara!

583
00:43:57,436 --> 00:44:00,021
- Do not move!
- You, release him

584
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,977
You know, as soon as possible,

585
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:05,804
Give me a piece of pendulum ...

586
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:09,786
- or I'll kill him,
- Tad, do not do that,

587
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:14,379
Sorry, I have no choice,

588
00:44:15,378 --> 00:44:16,351
Please,

589
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:37,035
And the notebook, please,

590
00:44:38,571 --> 00:44:42,065
Give me the notebook, if
no, you will not see it again!

591
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:46,199
You are disgusting!

592
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:51,958
Yes, now I have everything

593
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,002
Let us go

594
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:55,586
This is not fair

595
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,976
We do not experience all these problems
to hand that pendant to you!

596
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:05,180
That's what happens when you play around
with Jack Rackham,

597
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,687
Dog smells

598
00:45:17,822 --> 00:45:18,690
Sara!

599
00:45:19,562 --> 00:45:21,057
I thought I lost you.

600
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:25,583
I hope I have body fluids
So I can cry.

601
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:27,007
Belzoni ...

602
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:30,747
Friends, I'm glad to see you ...

603
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:33,166
Jeff, what happened to you?

604
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:36,770
We must be quick
Before Rakham finds the next section,

605
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,517
I'm not worried about that,

606
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,549
Tad, what do you mean

607
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,761
He wanted a notebook,
but the important part I've taken.

608
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:46,888
Very good, Tad,

609
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:50,240
Well, where are we going?

610
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,938
To Cappadocia in Turkey
There are hundreds of temples,

611
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:57,119
Racham will not find the right temple
without this page.

612
00:45:57,567 --> 00:45:59,765
It gives us a chance to leave early,
Let's go!

613
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:01,406
Let's go to Turkey!

614
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:12,622
- This is it!
- Thank you, how much does it cost?

615
00:46:12,874 --> 00:46:15,584
This trip is free for my Roman girl.

616
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:17,327
Why, thank you...!

617
00:46:17,712 --> 00:46:19,754
What does the Roman girl mean?

618
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:25,347
My gift to you

619
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,290
It nourishes the heart, soul and stomach of many people

620
00:46:29,762 --> 00:46:33,172
I will be waiting for you
Under the Alhambra lamp,

621
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:34,510
And you know that

622
00:46:37,982 --> 00:46:40,233
The Spaniards are crazy.

623
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:41,653
Good

624
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,063
Captain is looking for a place for us
on board

625
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:47,131
Well Look at this, Ted,

626
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,493
This is where the temple where the second piece is located.

627
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:52,454
Temple of Arenido?

628
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:54,882
Baal's wife, and
Goddess of Light,

629
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:57,216
Nice!
What about the third temple?

630
00:46:57,274 --> 00:47:00,119
This is a mystery, the only clue
all I have is this symbol ...

631
00:47:00,144 --> 00:47:02,704
What I found in everything
related to Midas ...

632
00:47:02,882 --> 00:47:05,133
Such a stamp or a personal signature!

633
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:07,677
Wow, you're the best, Sarah.

634
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:10,365
E ...

635
00:47:10,905 --> 00:47:11,948
Tad ...

636
00:47:12,236 --> 00:47:13,945
Yes, Sarah ...?

637
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:19,189
I want you to know...
After all this time...

638
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,399
We are separated from that promise.

639
00:47:23,832 --> 00:47:26,667
Are we going to go now or what?
I can die again if here goes on,

640
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,164
Oh, sorry, I'm ... ah ...

641
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:36,081
Well, thank you very much

642
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:39,144
Friend, we board this boat.

643
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:42,929
Tad you're the best!

644
00:47:42,954 --> 00:47:46,440
- Teeth "Juanita mummy".
- This is a floating city of Metropolis.

645
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,938
Ah ... no, that's not it.

646
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:52,214
But here it is!

647
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,151
Forget the metaphors of Metropolis,
little village is not this

648
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,087
Hi, Tiff?

649
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,723
- Hello ...
- Can I ask something?

650
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:08,317
Yes, of course,

651
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,079
Oh, this is so beautiful

652
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,081
You think, would Sarah like it?

653
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,250
Aooh ... Sarah ...

654
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:23,044
Yeah, I do not know
is this enough for her

655
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,808
Are you alright?

656
00:48:32,597 --> 00:48:36,516
Okay, I'm just seasick ... I can not fit in
because I am a land creature.

657
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:40,353
Instead, I'm on the mainland.

658
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:41,680
Oh, my goodness ...

659
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,983
You do not look much better than Me.

660
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:47,944
All this makes me think,

661
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:51,114
Come on .. everything is fine,

662
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:53,491
I'm very focused
At workplace...

663
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:56,036
I felt as if I cared
people close to me.

664
00:48:56,287 --> 00:49:00,332
One thing is certain, waffle can not finish anything.

665
00:49:00,683 --> 00:49:04,878
Take the initiative dong ..
do not just talk, act ..

666
00:49:06,062 --> 00:49:07,813
Actually this is good advice.

667
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,446
Oh, I have to admit it
those words are not from me,

668
00:49:10,471 --> 00:49:14,387
a man cheated of glare wealth in Las Vegas.
It took a while to learn the words.

669
00:49:16,716 --> 00:49:19,510
Do you want to try it on me first?
Just to see your appearance only.

670
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:22,335
Oh ...! Yes, good idea,

671
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,400
I thought you were right, I had to do it
Stop complaining and start acting

672
00:49:27,784 --> 00:49:31,370
- Well, this is my Sarah!
- Thank you, you helped me a lot

673
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,709
Just do my advice, it's free

674
00:49:33,866 --> 00:49:35,859
I will continue my vomiting ..

675
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,578
Oh, here it is ...

676
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,669
Okay, action, straight to the point.

677
00:49:53,511 --> 00:49:55,223
this looks pretty if you wear.

678
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:34,217
Thank you very much
They really have everything here.

679
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:38,763
Oooh, this is great, we are
Near the second part of the necklace,

680
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,891
- water?
- Do not be too enthusiastic

681
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:45,048
"Rackham" could be here. Take what you need
quickly, do not waste time

682
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:51,037
All right ... let's go

683
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:53,237
All right ... let's go

684
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:57,407
This is not possible..

685
00:50:57,658 --> 00:51:01,411
Let's see, It's impossible ..

686
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:04,581
Are you serious
What are you doing

687
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:07,472
You always complain about my clothes and humiliate me.

688
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:10,921
From now on I will be like you.

689
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:14,424
Mr. Perfect, see this

690
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:21,181
Officially already, your friend is very strange

691
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:25,060
Come on, bones
we solve this case immediately,

692
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:28,396
But ..
I do not like at all,

693
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:30,215
What are you going to do with the pot?

694
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,846
It's a present for me, and I like it.
I'll wear it anywhere

695
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:35,588
But I do not wear this thing on my back

696
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:38,323
Okay we will ask for the help of this little monster.

697
00:51:38,874 --> 00:51:42,761
- Hi, I'm Tad, Superkaka!
- No, no, Jeff,

698
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:44,908
I'm Tad, come here.

699
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:47,307
- Do not listen to this trick
- Eat this

700
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:48,458
Superkaka ...

701
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,208
Ashshashsh

702
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:54,806
I want for three groups. Divide and keep your eyes open.

703
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:56,739
There are dozens of temples here,

704
00:51:56,887 --> 00:51:57,870
Yes, Sir,

705
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:18,989
Report back here within three hours,

706
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:34,671
Well, this is the place,

707
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,276
Hey ... with a pkamungan !!!

708
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:39,564
Is not that beautiful, Sara?

709
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,291
- ......
- Of course,

710
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:43,680
Yes alright...

711
00:52:45,516 --> 00:52:48,794
It'll be dark soon, let's split up
To find the location of the temple,

712
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:50,437
Good, I went with ...!

713
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:53,232
With me, me and Tad
Brother for life,

714
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,727
Let's see who will find the temple first, men against women,

715
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:00,062
Come on Tiffany ..

716
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:03,060
Oh, luckily I immediately brokered

717
00:53:03,353 --> 00:53:06,330
What are you doing
I tried together with Sarah,

718
00:53:06,355 --> 00:53:09,078
Oh, did you see anything different from him?

719
00:53:09,772 --> 00:53:11,965
Well, she behaves rather oddly ...

720
00:53:12,386 --> 00:53:14,117
Of course, why not!

721
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,588
You are not as perfect as he had been expecting

722
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:18,775
- What?
- But do not be afraid.

723
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,112
We will make Sarah love you
up to your bones.

724
00:53:21,137 --> 00:53:23,506
They do not call me a "Peruvian heartbreaker" if this just can not

725
00:53:24,013 --> 00:53:26,014
It only takes some practice,

726
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,682
I do not believe!

727
00:53:27,934 --> 00:53:31,186
If we find the second part, we will be
very close to Midas,

728
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:33,605
Tiffaniy, your behavior is too inviting ...

729
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:36,233
Midas's power is very dangerous

730
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:39,411
Do you think we should not be looking for this necklace?

731
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:42,813
All I want to say is the necklace
Probably should not be exposed to the sun.

732
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:48,019
Hi handsome

733
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:49,943
Mummy, this will not work.

734
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,017
Mummy? Who's a mummy?
I'm Sara Lavrov,

735
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:54,961
No, no, no, I can not do it,

736
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:58,940
- Come on, do you like Sarah, yes or no?
- With all the heart.

737
00:53:59,048 --> 00:54:01,758
Then you must be willing
Do anything

738
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,306
- Sarah, I ...
- Yes?

739
00:54:08,558 --> 00:54:10,493
I know you have a lot of things
which is being thought of ...

740
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:11,444
Yes?

741
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:15,138
And that you barely have time for
To think about the current ...

742
00:54:15,444 --> 00:54:16,429
Where I live

743
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:22,310
But what I really want,
To live...

744
00:54:22,905 --> 00:54:24,419
always with you.

745
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,382
Anything, past ...

746
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,939
Current or future, I ...

747
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:32,080
I want to be your partner

748
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:35,917
Wading through life adventures

749
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:42,157
Hey, what are you doing?

750
00:54:42,266 --> 00:54:44,508
Sorry, this is great ..

751
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:47,522
You have to tell Sarah
as before, Sarah will accept it.

752
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:50,569
Every woman will fall in love now.

753
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:52,684
...

754
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:57,230
Not here either
There is nothing like written in the book

755
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:59,608
No way, we've been looking for up to twenty temples,

756
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:03,445
We have to find the right temple
Before the "Tad the professional" did it.

757
00:55:03,524 --> 00:55:05,072
You are a professional?

758
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:07,996
If your plan with Sarah does not work,
You must have plan B

759
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,665
sssss ... see,

760
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,424
This is the temple

761
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:15,840
Come back to "Rackham", maybe
the other team is luckier

762
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:22,805
- Stay here with "Jeff"
- And screamed
- Only if you see them back.

763
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,018
Nice...

764
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:37,974
It's scary ...

765
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:00,997
Tad, We're looking for you

766
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:02,874
This is the second part ...

767
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:05,877
Sarah found it!
I found it

768
00:58:06,128 --> 00:58:07,209
Not only that,

769
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:08,379
see

770
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,278
This mountain ...!

771
00:58:11,612 --> 00:58:13,009
Midas Symbol!

772
00:58:13,261 --> 00:58:16,805
Midas did not offer the last part
to the gods at this temple.

773
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:19,057
But handed over to Apollo.

774
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:21,001
The third part must be there!

775
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,886
Yes! We must be quick
Get it before "Rekham".

776
00:58:26,323 --> 00:58:28,049
Or we can just destroy this

777
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:29,854
Destroyed?

778
00:58:29,944 --> 00:58:33,166
The greatest discovery in history?
You can not do that

779
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:36,720
Tiffany, we can not let it
Rakham gained this power.

780
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:39,153
But Sarah, we're very close ...

781
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:42,038
"Tad," let's end it now.

782
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:44,946
No, Tad, you can not do that
Do not give it. that's crazy!

783
00:58:45,751 --> 00:58:46,470
Sarah,

784
00:58:46,671 --> 00:58:48,728
Would not it be better
Getting three parts

785
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,299
The power of God can not be
Fall into the hands of man,

786
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,886
If "Rackham" gets the necklace
He will be invincible.

787
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:01,474
Wait! Where is Tiffany?

788
00:59:05,523 --> 00:59:07,065
I do not believe!

789
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:08,857
Sarah I'm sorry

790
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:12,152
I have to find the third part and
destroy it before it is found Rekham.

791
00:59:12,403 --> 00:59:13,495
Sara, wait for me!

792
00:59:13,596 --> 00:59:16,348
I want to be alone!

793
00:59:24,755 --> 00:59:26,499
Your Idiots!

794
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:29,402
Do you want to say that every one of you ...

795
00:59:29,605 --> 00:59:31,069
Today ...

796
00:59:31,094 --> 00:59:32,932
Not finding anything?

797
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:34,637
This is useless !!

798
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:37,527
The Tad hat has tricked me!

799
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:47,270
I want to be with the winning team.

800
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:01,526
Oh, here you are
Where have you been?

801
01:00:02,237 --> 01:00:04,238
Hey, are not you with Sarah?

802
01:00:04,676 --> 01:00:06,946
He has gone,

803
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:08,559
And Tiffany?

804
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:11,916
He also has ... also gone,

805
01:00:13,237 --> 01:00:15,905
official already, you are
disaster for women,

806
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:17,751
How can I be so stupid!

807
01:00:17,919 --> 01:00:20,721
- Do you want my opinion?
- All I have to do is get the pendulum.

808
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,447
solve it, then finish the case

809
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:28,895
Do you know in 500 years
I've seen all kinds of catastrophic love,

810
01:00:28,974 --> 01:00:30,989
But your worst situation,

811
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:32,169
Do not start again,

812
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:35,324
Seriously, I've never seen a person fail as often as you

813
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:37,775
Yes, yes, I understand.

814
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:45,164
But I have not seen anyone
exploring the whole world for love like you,

815
01:00:47,456 --> 01:00:49,791
Now you must complete it!

816
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,150
I ... I do not know if I'm ready.

817
01:00:52,337 --> 01:00:53,683
Of course you are ready

818
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,730
You've done everything to get
the woman you love ...

819
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:58,960
Now they need you more than ever,

820
01:01:00,553 --> 01:01:03,279
You're right, I do not think
To say this, but ...

821
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,128
You are right
I have to help him,

822
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:08,547
This is my brother
Come on, Tiger, Tiger!

823
01:01:08,828 --> 01:01:12,314
Here I come, Sarah, Tad Stone
will solve this problem.

824
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,959
Come on, one more step.

825
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:59,004
I can not go any further, a tad

826
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,531
I do not feel my legs!

827
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:04,817
Oh, my legs!
Oh no!

828
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:13,580
Sarah ...

829
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,261
See, there,

830
01:03:19,834 --> 01:03:20,801
Rakham ...

831
01:03:21,002 --> 01:03:22,002
We must help him.

832
01:03:22,027 --> 01:03:24,688
Oh no, no, now I am
should climb down?

833
01:03:24,863 --> 01:03:26,672
This is a violation of human rights,

834
01:03:26,773 --> 01:03:30,358
First, you are not a human being,
second, we do not have time for that

835
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:33,419
Hey, this is my gift!
What would you do

836
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:34,823
Yes used it

837
01:03:41,577 --> 01:03:43,860
You do not know what to do, Tiffany

838
01:04:02,235 --> 01:04:04,236
Okay Jeff, come here

839
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:06,727
Come here

840
01:04:06,828 --> 01:04:08,641
this stuff is multifunctional,

841
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:11,594
Be careful I do not want any later ...

842
01:04:32,811 --> 01:04:34,559
What is this?

843
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:45,060
- You again, - "hero
professional."

844
01:04:46,577 --> 01:04:47,569
Tiffany?

845
01:04:49,009 --> 01:04:50,940
- Tad!
- Sarah!

846
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:52,959
What are you doing here

847
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,192
I can not leave you
alone, Sara, I ...

848
01:04:56,217 --> 01:04:59,803
Stop!
Let's move on, we're almost there,

849
01:05:20,104 --> 01:05:21,113
Apollo!

850
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:24,072
Where the altar, and
last part?

851
01:05:24,294 --> 01:05:27,396
Midas built this temple as the last sacrifice for Apollo.

852
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:29,554
There is only one place to find the pieces

853
01:06:03,564 --> 01:06:06,608
- You! Bring me the pendulum,
- Just dream you!

854
01:06:06,859 --> 01:06:08,952
All right, I'll go.

855
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,083
Hey, you! Do not be rude

856
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:32,238
Tad?

857
01:06:33,386 --> 01:06:37,911
I'm not Tad!
I am King Midas,

858
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:43,512
I entered her body and I
will not give you this necklace,

859
01:06:45,031 --> 01:06:47,232
I'm choking,

860
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:49,226
What are you saying?

861
01:06:49,433 --> 01:06:51,284
Frankly, do not know.

862
01:06:51,419 --> 01:06:52,708
I have to try something.

863
01:06:53,991 --> 01:06:55,851
He has no shame.

864
01:06:59,036 --> 01:07:01,955
Now, plug it in for me.

865
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:07,627
Thank you, loser,

866
01:07:49,128 --> 01:07:51,855
Well, you already have what you are
want, let them go now,

867
01:07:52,657 --> 01:07:54,533
There's a problem, honey

868
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,354
I will not let the team lose
to go

869
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:01,435
What? We have an agreement,
You can strength, I can fame

870
01:08:01,632 --> 01:08:02,766
And you will not hurt them,

871
01:08:02,886 --> 01:08:05,221
Do you believe these kids?
They are very naive

872
01:08:05,558 --> 01:08:09,436
Ha ha ha! I hope I can believe that

873
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:11,854
- Well, nothing moves!

874
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:16,112
Give me the necklace and let's go ...!

875
01:08:16,364 --> 01:08:17,242
No!

876
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,993
You do not understand

877
01:08:21,317 --> 01:08:24,411
I now have the power of Midas!

878
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:32,311
Run!

879
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:36,223
Oh, hello

880
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:43,877
I like this,

881
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:47,233
Friends, I do not want to die now!

882
01:08:47,258 --> 01:08:50,421
- I do not want to die!
- You're dead from the first. Run!

883
01:09:03,841 --> 01:09:05,154
We have to stop it,

884
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:08,081
- Yes, yes, I've tried,
- Are you alright?

885
01:09:08,221 --> 01:09:10,055
Yes, give me time,

886
01:09:10,121 --> 01:09:11,886
Hello, this guy is very angry!

887
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:18,951
I borrow this, and let's spread and surround him.

888
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:21,820
- You're there
- go!

889
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:37,562
Where are you going

890
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:48,864
thank you

891
01:09:59,636 --> 01:10:01,805
- I am sorry,
- professional hero,

892
01:10:05,223 --> 01:10:08,558
Do not forget me

893
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:13,772
I'm really sick of you!

894
01:10:31,801 --> 01:10:33,106
Sara!
No!

895
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,400
What do you really want ?!

896
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:11,371
Say goodbye to him ...!

897
01:11:34,177 --> 01:11:36,795
We succeed Sarah, it's over

898
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:38,189
Tad,

899
01:11:39,404 --> 01:11:40,321
Sara?

900
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:45,777
No, no, no! This should not happen
Not you, no!

901
01:11:46,237 --> 01:11:48,187
Oh no! This is bad,

902
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:51,369
Well, there must be a way
To stop it,

903
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:52,913
...
- sacrifice!

904
01:11:53,164 --> 01:11:56,499
Midas can get his daughter back,
I must destroy that chain!

905
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:08,008
No!

906
01:12:09,888 --> 01:12:11,295
This is all my fault,

907
01:12:11,396 --> 01:12:13,290
- I have to destroy this part,
- T ...

908
01:12:13,315 --> 01:12:16,893
- Sorry I'm so sorry
- Do not blame yourself, "TAD".

909
01:12:17,007 --> 01:12:19,278
I had a wonderful adventure,

910
01:12:19,303 --> 01:12:21,139
All day with you

911
01:12:21,164 --> 01:12:24,212
- Sara, no!
- I will not exchange it with anything,

912
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:25,570
Please do not leave me,

913
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:27,606
...
- Sarah,

914
01:12:27,755 --> 01:12:29,881
I...

915
01:12:30,368 --> 01:12:31,985
Love...

916
01:12:32,537 --> 01:12:34,872
No! No!

917
01:12:43,214 --> 01:12:47,110
Tad, we have to go!

918
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:50,387
Tad, come on!

919
01:12:50,947 --> 01:12:53,457
Just go
I'll stay

920
01:12:57,236 --> 01:13:01,073
All I want is with you.

921
01:13:05,259 --> 01:13:06,535
I love you

922
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:33,889
What?

923
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:09,356
- Hello, - Sara!

924
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:12,327
Tad is ready to die for her,

925
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,653
Sacrifice for love,

926
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:16,489
Sara!

927
01:14:47,014 --> 01:14:49,474
- Hello Friends, hamburgers?
- thank you

928
01:14:50,523 --> 01:14:53,725
- Hey friends, thanks for coming,
- a tad, beautiful party!

929
01:14:53,886 --> 01:14:55,537
But where is your girlfriend? Yes?

930
01:14:55,562 --> 01:14:57,655
Do not you know
It's out there

931
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,579
Looking for a great discovery,

932
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:04,021
- Seriously, he will come
- I do not need to believe it.

933
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:06,581
No, he'll be right here

934
01:15:06,606 --> 01:15:08,817
How is my tiger?

935
01:15:16,174 --> 01:15:17,350
"Tad"!

936
01:15:20,091 --> 01:15:22,130
- Hello, Sara, - Hi, honey

937
01:15:23,264 --> 01:15:26,908
Look at this

938
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:31,073
The party ends for them.

939
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:33,333
But what are you going to do now?

940
01:15:33,522 --> 01:15:36,889
Oh, I'll be back to
Paitete, it's a return ticket,

941
01:15:36,914 --> 01:15:39,464
They will go crazy, they like
see lots of gold ..

942
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,641
I will miss you too

943
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,890
I do not want to cry
I do not want to cry

944
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:46,622
Oh! No fluid, me
can not cry!

945
01:15:46,805 --> 01:15:48,844
I heard him
who can not cry

946
01:15:50,318 --> 01:15:52,277
I'm waiting for you at Al-Hamra Palace ...

947
01:15:52,318 --> 01:15:54,112
You did not come,

948
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:55,884
You?
How do you...

949
01:15:55,909 --> 01:15:58,189
Our little friend guides me to you

950
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:02,796
Rats, I'm happier than
Cockroach in the toilet!

951
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,286
Oh, I like your smile
Hey my Roman girl!

952
01:16:06,485 --> 01:16:09,653
I'm a little afraid of the meaning of the Roman girl.

953
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:13,079
but what is the importance?
Let's start the real party!

954
01:16:14,217 --> 01:16:15,690
This is crazy driving me crazy ...

955
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:19,563
You will miss him too

956
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:22,419
Maybe he is the most
likes to bully, intimidate,

957
01:16:22,613 --> 01:16:24,680
Nobody wore clothes worse than him.

958
01:16:25,269 --> 01:16:27,487
But you're right
I will miss him,

959
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:29,691
Well, I know this is different topic

960
01:16:29,716 --> 01:16:32,676
But maybe this will make you happy.

961
01:16:33,602 --> 01:16:35,620
Are you serious

962
01:16:36,769 --> 01:16:38,131
Yes!

963
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:47,072
Sorry, you know
I did this when ...

964
01:16:48,024 --> 01:16:49,852
Do you still want to be my boyfriend?

965
01:16:54,037 --> 01:16:56,997
Come on! To dance to everyone

966
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:40,412
So next time
