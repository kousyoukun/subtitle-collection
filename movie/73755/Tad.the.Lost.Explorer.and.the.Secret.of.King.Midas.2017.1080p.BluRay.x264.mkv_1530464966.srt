00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,238
真搞不懂
你幹嘛覺得這些老古董這麼有意思
I do not understand what makes you so interested in these old things.

Do not start again, nothing

But even though the distance is very far

Do you think he'll like it, Jeff?

110

我有20天沒喝水了
I did not drink for 20 days,

120

This is disgusting ....

121

你簡直沒法想像
You can not imagine, the difficulty of my journey to meet you

122
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,460
見到你真是太好了！
- Nice to meet you again!
- This is impossible, what are you doing here?

123
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,843
不可能！你來這裏幹什麼？

124
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,478
Oh, this is a long story,

125
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,749
說來話長 我還是不說為妙

126
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,648
I prefer not to tell you,
but, i will say ..

127
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,722
不過我會的 你瞧

128
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,634
你離開我的失落之城後
我因為放你走這個罪名而受到審判
When you leave town, I am taken to court.

129
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,801
木乃伊法庭將我放逐了！
The city council accused me of allowing you
Escape and have alienated Me,

130
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,394
他們把你掃地出門了？

132
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,557
嗯 我跟律師把交易搞砸了
不過那是題外話了
Well, because the lawyers are bad
But this is a different story.

133
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,899
重點是 我得告別我老家的墓地

134
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,989
The truth is, I have to say
goodbye to my house,

135
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,112
進行從未有過的長途跋涉
I travel the furthest
during my life

136
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,357
我在沙漠裏跟蹤奇怪的線條走
迷路了
He got lost in the desert, moment
he followed the strange line

137
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,197
我不知道該怎麼辦
I do not know what to do...

138
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,534
然後 我想起了你

139
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,648
Then I remember, my only friend.

140
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,704
我唯一的人類朋友！

141
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,910
朋友？
- Friends?
- You are right

142
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,334
你說得對 我們更像兄弟

143
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,263
We are more like brothers,

144
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,039
你能管一下這個小怪物嗎？
Please
Can you control this little animal?

145
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,464
傑夫 下來 狗狗！
Jeff, come here,

146
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,998
抱歉 我正好要出門

163
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,041
聽著 你是木乃伊 你很嚇人

164
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,813
Scary for people, in the world

165
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,910

What did you see?
It's a real heartbreaker.

185
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,876
好吧
Well,

186
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,628
我會請求她做我的女朋友
I'll ask her to be my girlfriend.

187
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:36,907
Oh, I do not know how to tell you about this Tad ..

188
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,847
我不知道該怎麼說 泰德

189
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,179
但你好像有點配不上她
But maybe, you do not look like her class

190
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,135
就好像癩蛤蟆想吃天鵝肉
You know, as if you were swimming against the tide.

191
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,147
好比她是十分 你才兩分
He's famous and cool, and you're a loser.

192

她很性感 你卻不是
She is beautiful you do not.

193
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
你根本配不上她

- Thanks for all these motivations, buddy
- Thank you brothers

194
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,646

「好棒」是什麼意思？
What is "beautiful"?

201
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,675
如果人們非常喜歡某樣東西
就會這麼說…

天哪！

邁達斯國王的莎草紙手稿
King Papyrus "Midas"!

258
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,527
你能讀上面的銘文嗎？
Can you read the writing?

259
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:21,695
Made in ... China?

260
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,615
「中國製造」？

261
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,381
His Papyrus manuscript, not his pigura,

262
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,282
莎草紙手稿 不是檯子

263
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:27,425
Yes ... sorry for my mistake

264
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,204
嗯 這…抱歉 不好意思

265
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,832
看起來像是聖書文
They look like hieroglyphs,

266
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,214
沒錯
Right,

267
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,959
這麼久以來 我一直在研究這個東西
This is where I work so far.

268
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,785
邁達斯的魔法項圈
The magical Pendant "King Midas" consists of three pieces,

269
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,589
由三塊組成

270
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,915
其中一塊好像在巴耳紅廟裏
One of them can be found at
Red Temple, Pal,

271
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,849
我發現了這些聖書文
它們指明了紅廟的確切地點
I found this hieroglyph ...

272
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,960
See the exact location
From the temple,

273
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,472
如果項圈真的存在…
If the pendant really does exist ...

274
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,388
那邁達斯的點金術也是真的！
So does Midas gold touch.

275
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:56,348
點石成金的魔法
Ability to change everything

276
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,994
泰德 我一直很忙…

277
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,680
Sara, ah ...

278
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:03,991
莎拉…

279
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:06,155
I...

280
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,993
我有件事情想問你
I have something to do
I asked you.

281

Yes, talk

282
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,162
你想成為我的…
Would you be...

283
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:15,765
Being ...?

284
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,623
成為我的…

285
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,416
木乃伊！
Mummy?!

286
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,541
成為你的木乃伊？
Your mummy?

287
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,337
-莎拉！
-是你？
- Sarah!
- You?

288
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,300
過來 抱抱
Come here, give me a hug!

289
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,885
我叫你在車裏等著！
I've told you to wait in the car!

290
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,377
你來這裏做什麼？
But what are you doing here?

291
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,514
我最好還是別告訴你
Oh, I better not tell you,
well, I'll tell you,

292
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,925
不過我會的
你瞧 當你離開我的失落之城後…

293
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,469
You know, when you go
From The Lost City ...

294
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,886
嗯 很好 我稍後會告訴她的
All right, I'll tell him later,

295
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,065
拉弗羅夫小姐？

296
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,945
Bu Lavrov?
The show for tonight,

297
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,307
今晚的講稿

298
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,654
嘿 貓王是怎麼回事？
What happened to Elvis?

299
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,477
他是我的老朋友
He was an old friend,

300
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,232
-對嗎 木乃伊？
-你好啊！
- Right, mummy?
- Hello!

301
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,566
你叫他「木乃伊」？
Did you call him a mummy?

302
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,197
-對 他保存得不怎麼好
-喂！
- Yes, he does not matter,
- Hey ?!

303
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,084
恕我告辭 我還有很多事情要做
Please excuse me
I still have a lot to do,

304
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,039
對 別擔心
Oh, yes, do not worry, come on

305
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,200
來吧！

306
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,247
再見！再見 莎拉！
Goodbye Goodbye, Sarah!

307
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,582
你幹嘛穿成這樣？
Why are you wearing this?

308
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,957
我明白你幹嘛這麼愛她了
I understand why
you love him so much,

309
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,042
你絕對是癩蛤蟆想吃天鵝肉
This is great for you

310
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,506
（私人領地 請勿入內）

311
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,018
走吧
Come on,

312
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,329
好了 貓王 回頭見
- All right, Elvis, see you later,
- Yeah, let's go to the party!

313
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,246
耶！我們去參加派對！

314
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,001
不 你留在這裏
You can not stay here

315
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,581
什麼？你又要把我一個人拋在這裏？
What? You leave me alone again?

316
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,883
到莎拉的演示講完為止
Only until Sara's presentation ended

317
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,416
我不想惹麻煩 懂嗎？
I do not want
there is a problem, I understand?

318
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,931
好 好吧 如果你答應我一件事
我就會留在這裏
All right, I'll stay here
But on one condition,

319
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,335
什麼事？
Condition?

320
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,177
把你的邪惡小狗帶走
Bring this dog with you.

321
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,969
過來 傑夫 過來這裏！
Come here, Jeff.

322
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,348
別離開房間 好嗎？
Do not leave the room, okay?

323
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,438
不棒！
Not good

324
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,076
嗨 你好 幸會…
Hi. Nice to meet you...

325
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,378
嗨 你好嗎？幸會…
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you...

326
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,835
你好！我叫泰德！
Hi, my name is Tad,

327
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,417
我說的語言不對嗎？
What is my fault yes, do I speak the language
wrong?

328
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,009
嘿 貝爾佐尼 很高興見到你！
Hey, Belzoni, nice to meet you!

329
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,469
（服務生）

330
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,805
服務生？什麼意思？
Waiter?
What do you mean

331
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,271
不可能 這是我最好的西裝
Not really
This is my favorite.

332
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,333
Woohoo ...

333
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,909
讓我來 先生
I'll take care of this, sir

334
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,793
好好盯著那人
Keep watching him

335
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:18,469
一個古代遺物
揭露了邁達斯國王的真實故事
Old manuscripts

336
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:18,248
Unraveling the true story of King "Midas",

337
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:22,347
一份名為《為愛犧牲》莎草紙手稿
This is the Papyrus, known as
"Sacrifice for Love".

338
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:25,096
God chose him as the legendary king, defeating all his opponents.

339
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:27,573
上面說他是一位叱吒風雲的國王
為阿波羅打敗了所有敵人

340
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:27,332
dedicating his victory to the god Apollo ...

341
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:33,146
阿波羅很感激 將一個由三塊金子
組成的項圈賜給邁達斯國王
In return, Apollo gave Midas
Magic necklace

342
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,213
Necklace with three pieces of gold,

343
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:36,716
The necklace gives strength
for the wearer ...

344
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,281
項圈的佩戴者

345
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,866
擁有點金術

346
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:40,345
Ability to change
all that is touched to gold,

347
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,829
邁達斯聚集了堆積如山的金子

348
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:44,140
Midas collects
ton by ton gold,

349
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,671
他碰觸過的任何東西
都變成了寶貴的金屬
Everything he touched his hands turned into gold

350
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,264
但他的點金術很快變成了詛咒
But this golden touch ...

351
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,919
It soon became a curse,

352
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:54,841
他女兒伸出雙手去抱他
也變成了金子
Her daughter wanted to hug her,

353
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,902
He turned into gold

354
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,973
心痛欲絕的邁達斯去找阿波羅
懇求他大發慈悲
Desperate, Midas returns to Apollo
and ask for mercy

355
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,524
阿波羅叫邁達斯把項圈扔掉
Apollo says Midas must release his necklace.

356
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:08,729
將三塊金子分別獻給
世界各地三座不同廟裏的神
and presented the three golden pendulum.

357
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,267
To God in different parts of the world ...

358
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,276
邁達斯聽從了阿波羅的命令
Midas carries out all the Apollo messages

359
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,950
放棄了強大的法力 讓女兒起死回生
Abstinence surrendered and with
tremendous power,

360
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,238
In order to bring her daughter back to life,

361
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:20,616
或者換句話說 他為愛犧牲
In other words,

362
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,318
Sacrifice for love,

363
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:22,178
Wow!

364
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,210
各位
Ladies and gentlemen,

365
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:34,756
我很榮幸為大家呈現我最重要的發現
This is my honor
To show my greatest discovery,

366
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,849
這份確鑿的證據證明了數千年前
Conclusive evidence,
that thousands of years ago ...

367
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,599
邁達斯國王和他的項圈的確存在

368
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,866
the legend of King Midas and his necklace,
there really is

369
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,985
禮物？
Gift?

370
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,231
邁達斯的莎草紙手稿
Papyrus Midas,

371
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,286
這才叫派對
It's the party!

372
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,431
到手了 老大
We can, boss,

373
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,760
-快追 貝爾佐尼！
-抓住他！
- Go away, Belzoni!
- catch him!

374
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,665
Oh oh...

375
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:46,829
（跳）

376
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,587
-是你？
-嘿 謝了
- You
- Hey, thanks,

377
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,261
我拿到了！
- could!
- No, I can!

378
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,556
不 我拿到了！

379
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:14,941
泰德！
TAD!

380
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,517
你跟我來
You will come with me

381
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,017
放開我！
Keep your hands away from me!

382
00:21:58,694 --> 00:21:59,944
莎拉！
Sarah ...

383
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:10,121
-泰德！
-莎拉！
- Tad!
- Sarah!

384
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,041
來找我！
Find me!

385
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,634
No!

386
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,965
莎拉…
Sarah ...

387
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,235
醒醒 泰德
Get up, Tad

388
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,227
來找我
Find me

389
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,569
泰德 快醒醒
TAD

390
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,087
Come back to me

391
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,648
泰德
Tad, Bangun, Tad,

392
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,111
快醒醒 泰德

393
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,407
等等 莎拉在哪？他們把她抓走了
Wait, where's Sarah?
They kidnapped her,

394
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:51,157
是綁架！就像皮薩羅和阿塔瓦爾帕！
He was kidnapped as
"Pizarro" "Atahualpa"

395
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,788
就像科爾特斯和蒙特祖馬！
事實上 就像
Like Curtis and Moctizuma as
Juanita Mo ... ,,,,,

396
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,786
泰德 你沒事吧？
Tad, are you okay?

397
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,501
嗯 這玩意很經用
Yes, the blow was not much,

398
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,011
等一下…
Wait a minute,

399
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,924
莎拉的筆記本 她想送給我
Sarah's notebook, she wanted to give it to me.

400
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,593
這幫暴徒綁架了莎拉
肯定是想她帶他們去找邁達斯的項圈
I think criminals have picked it up
and asks Sara to show the necklace of King Midas,

401
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,351
但我們必須先找到它
Yes we have to find it first.

402
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,480
有了這個 我們就能比他們搶先一步
拯救莎拉
With this, we can go one step further
and save Sara,

403
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,017
看看這個
Look at this,

404
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,555
巴耳紅廟
Red Temple Pal

405
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,730
莎拉認為這是邁達斯朝聖的第一站

406
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:19,563
Sarah was sure this was Midas's first stop
to start his journey.

407
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,316
找到這個地點的關鍵
就在這些聖書文裏
Lock location
In this hieroglyph,

408
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:23,783
但我沒法破譯它們
But I can not describe it,

409
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,532
我來看看
我看能否找到塔特蘇斯語的內容
Let me see, I'll try something
To find Tetrazaya,

410
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,954
太好了 我們還應該找找相關方言
Right, and we have to know too
their dialect,

411
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:31,866
好主意
Great idea

412
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:36,602
Oh,

413
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,464
那些古老語言根本沒有參考資料
Almost no reference
For this ancient language,

414
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,416
-完全是死角
-肯定有辦法
Dead end

415
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,831
There must be a way,

416
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,803
「在那裏 你應該會找到巴耳」
And then you will find Baal,

417
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
你剛剛說什麼？
What did you just say?

418
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,522
不 其他的內容
- No, no, nothing else
- Ah,

419
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,436
用英語說！你怎麼會認得那種文字？
Language translation!
How can you read?

420
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:01,654
滅絕語言是我的專長 瞧瞧
Well, this dead language is
my expertise, look.

421
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,655
看見了吧？死翹翹
Did you see that?
Truly fluent tongue, ha ha ..

422
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,857
你的朋友是個怪咖
Your friend is a bit weird,

423
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,764
Oh, you can not imagine it,

424
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:08,744
你壓根不知道呢

425
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:12,414
這上面說：「距離黎明四個太陽
Here he says: Four Suns ...

426
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:14,654
Horseback riding, from, sitvilla,

427
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,544
離賽特費拉一馬之遙

428
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,711
在那裏 你應該會找到巴耳」
There you will find hubby,

429
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,134
「賽特費拉…」
Setefilla,

430
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,462
抱歉 小傢伙
Sorry, my friend

431
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,798
賽特費拉就是塔特西人口中的
塞維利亞城
Sitifilla is what is called Tartesus
City of Sevilla,

432
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,098
「距離黎明四個太陽」
Four, sun, opposite, sunrise,

433
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,218
在古代 一個太陽表示一天
Of course one sun means
One day in ancient times,

434
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,385
一馬之遙…
Horseback riding...

435
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,484
193公里
About 250 kilometers,

436
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,270
距離黎明193公里 往東！
250 kilometers to the dawn,

437
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:42,787
To the east,

438
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:46,404
格拉納達
Granada, the Red Temple.
For "Pal" in Granada,

439
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,698
巴耳紅廟在格拉納達！

440
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,822
這就對了 泰德
阿蘭布拉宮在那裏
That is, Tad, there is the Alhambra,

441
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,541
這座摩爾人宮殿也被稱為「紅宮」
Islamic Fort
Also known as La Roja,

442
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,329
他們會把莎拉帶去那裏！
They took Sarah there,

443
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,747
做好準備 大夥兒 我們要去西班牙
Get ready friends,
we will go to Spain,

444
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,085
-西班牙！
-是的
- Spanish, uh, uh, -
we will come, "Midas".

445
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,923
等著我們 邁達斯！

446
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,005
堅持住 莎拉
Be patient Sara, Tad
Stone will solve this case,

447
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,627
泰德史東斯親自出馬

448
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,389
最後問你一次
For the last,

449
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:17,768
我如何用這個找到邁達斯的項圈？
How can I use this?
To search for "Midas" necklace.

450
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,355
我不會告訴你一個字
I will not tell you anything,

451
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:25,114
別管她 還有其他辦法逼她合作
I left it, there is another way
Forcing them to work more together

452
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:31,568
會管用嗎 長官？
吐真劑可能已經過期了
Are you sure you want to use the truth serum?
This serum may be expired

453
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,197
只有一種方法可以見真章
Well, there is only one way
To find out,

454
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,003
你認為我是怎樣的人？
What do you think

455
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,887
I pack, ... ,,,,,,

456
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,209
長官…

457
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,343
說嘛 別害羞
Come on, do not be shy,

458
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:46,764
-嗯？
-不 我不能…
No, I can not, you ...

459
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,960
你…

460
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,300
你是個傲慢的惡霸
一點都不酷 而且很小氣
You are a dictator, stupid
Murahan,

461
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:53,636
對不起
I am sorry

462
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,388
安靜點！
Do not you dare!

463
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,426
你還是個爸寶
You are also spoiled child!

464
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,154
你的腳臭死了！
And your feet smell.

465
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,687
該你了
Your turn

466
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,075
項圈的金塊在哪？
Where are the pieces of the necklaces?

467
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,491
我不會告訴你一個字
I will not tell you anything,

468
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,244
別強忍不說 你想說出來的
Do not refuse, you want to tell me.

469
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:19,662
不…
No ... my head,

470
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,496
我的頭…邁達斯…

471
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,536
- Midas ...
- that's right .. where the location of the piece,

472
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,248
這就對了！金塊在哪裏？

473
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,803
所有的一切都在我的筆記本裏
Everything in the notebook,

474
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:29,714
泰德…
Tad, Tad,

475
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:30,798
泰德…

476
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
剛才發生了什麼事？
What happened

477
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,643
你肯定對她用藥過量了 長官
I think the dosage is too high, sir,

478
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,348
一群笨蛋！她說的那個泰德是誰？
Idiot,

479
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,631
Who was Tad this girl called?

480
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,678
長官 我覺得就是那位大鼻子男士
I think that's the man
the big nose,

481
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,064
把筆記本給我！
I want that notebook,

482
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,273
找到那個笨蛋泰德！
Find the fool Tad.

483
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,573
怎麼了？
What?

484
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:58,077
你能壓低嗓門 別引人注意嗎？
you can sing softer and
Do not draw attention?

485
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,952
有人嫉妒我充滿陽剛之氣的嗓音哦
Are you jealous in my soft voice?

486
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,462
我們需要給你找一個更好的偽裝
We need to find you undercover
better,

487
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,956
說什麼呢？我看起來帥呆了
What are you talking about, I look great.

488
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,878
這麼說我們要去這裏？

489
00:27:10,857 --> 00:27:13,934
So where do we go?
Beautiful, beautiful ...

490
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,258
好棒 好棒棒…

491
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:18,283
Oh, look, there's good food in Spain,

492
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,428
聽著 這上面說西班牙的食物很美味

493
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,564
你超級能吃的 對吧？
do you like it

494
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,637
好棒 好棒棒…
Good, good
Tad, who is Antonio Banderas?

495
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,695
泰德 安東尼奧班德拉斯
是什麼玩意？

496
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,812
（拉斯維加斯）

497
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,726
（大西洋）

498
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,316
（格拉納達）

499
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,490
簡直不敢相信 我們即將做出大發現
I can not believe we are headed for this great discovery,

500
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,663
我們可以創造歷史
- We can write history,
- Yes, but it will not be easy,

501
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,616
嗯 不會容易的

502
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:45,075
我們必須破譯這些註釋
才能找到巴耳廟
We have to solve this
To find the Temple of Baal,

503
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,126
"The match has been stolen again,"

504
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,461
德士！
Taxi.

505
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:49,995
去阿蘭布拉宮
To go to Alhambra?

506
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,258
好的 我的朋友 上車吧
Of course my friend
Come here

507
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,381
謝了
thank you

508
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,634
等等 木乃伊呢？
Wait a minute, where's the mummy?

509
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,507
他說他要去找合適的衣服穿
He went looking for the right clothes

510
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,885
合適？他怎麼會合適…
The right clothes?
How do you know what ... ,,,,?

511
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,769
真不敢相信
I do not believe,

512
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,105
真不敢相信
I do not believe,

513
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:13,693
真不敢相信這裏的人都這麼打扮
太奇怪了！
I can not believe someone can look that way
Looks great.

514
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,809
Geez, Geez, Geez

515
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:34,835
我從未見過如此優雅的打扮
That's the most beautiful elegance
that I've seen

516
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,998
Oh very good,

517
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,086
你真好心！

518
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,469
你現在開心了嗎？
Are you happy now?

519
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,514
但願你不要一直說我在招惹目光
I hope you do not say it again
I draw attention

520
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,056
如果你開口 我願意帶你去天涯海角
I want to take you to the end of the world if you ask for it,

521
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:51,688
就眼下來說
送我們去阿蘭布拉宮就好
Now just take us
To Al Hamra Palace,

522
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,525
嗯 我們也可以去那裏
Well, we can go there too,

523
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:57,653
開車嘍
Let's go,

524
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:06,043
筆記本在他們手上 長官？請下令
They have notebooks,
sir, what is your command,

525
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,578
-把筆記本從那個小丑手上搶過來
-收到
Seize the book from the clown's hand,

526
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,562
do it...

527
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,747
求你了 別傷害泰德
Please do not hurt Tad,

528
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:16,048
別擔心 我們不會讓他很痛苦
Do not worry, I will not let it
they suffered so much,

529
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,631
大概會這樣
- I try, - wealth?

530
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,265
財富？這一切都是為了財富？

531
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,328
All this for the sake of wealth?

532
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,511
好可愛
This is very naive,

533
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,387
不
No,

534
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:31,481
邁達斯的法力比財富更強大 親愛的
Midas strength can be more than that, dear ..

535
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,614
那是什麼？
What is this

536
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,275
我從古董商那裏買的
Something I bought from
An antique dealer

537
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:42,617
邁達斯的法力是眾神的法力
Midas Strength ...

538
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:42,808
Is the power of the gods,

539
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,911
統治世界的法力
The ability to control the world,

540
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:51,205
它將會屬於我
And this will be mine,

541
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:57,188
Hi beauty .. I do not think
you are from this world,

542
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:57,337
簡直不敢相信你是這個世界上的人

543
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:00,552
嚴格來說 我不是這個世界上的
說來話長
Actually, I'm not from
this world, the story is ...

544
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,684
-你會知道的 當我…
-別說了！
- So I...
- I am quiet.

545
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,317
Hey, do you know the people behind us?

546
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,136
你們認識跟在我們後面那些人嗎？

547
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,395
天哪 我們有麻煩了 各位
Oh no, we have a problem,

548
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:17,783
-天哪！我們有危險嗎？
-別擔心 我的寶貝
Dear God .. we are in danger,

549
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,955
Calm, beauty,

550
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,571
我發誓 只要有我在
你肯定會安然無恙
I swear it will not happen to you
As long as there is me,

551
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:32,668
他們越來越近了！
Oh, they are getting closer.

552
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,536
他們想要筆記本！
They wanted a notebook,

553
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:39,463
好帥的紀念品！
Oh, nice souvenirs,

554
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,220
不是給你的！
Not for you

555
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:45,096
-喂 你幹嘛扔掉啊？
-快點 幫我呀！
- Hey, but why throw it away?
- Please help me,

556
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,891
我拿到了！
Well, I understand, I understand,
let's start with that.

557
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,348
扔！

558
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,057
帥！
Yes,

559
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,686
-你好
-你好
- Hello, "
- Oh hai,

560
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:07,283
小心
Watch Out

561
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,542
快！打開車篷！
Quickly open the car's lid,

562
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,323
Oliy,

563
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,560
傑夫！
Jeff,

564
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,057
天哪！我們逃不掉了！
Stop, stop, stop, we will not survive.

565
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,781
午休時間到了
Party time ..

566
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,074
-司機倒下了！
-泰德！
- Nam, - Tad!

567
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,489
沒關係 蒂芙妮 我能搞定！
Okay, Tiv, do not worry

568
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,629
讓開！
- Move!
- Watch Out!

569
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,750
來了！

570
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,085
這是什麼玩意？
What is this?

571
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:19,558
-小心！
-什麼？
- see
- What?

572
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,770
橋！
Bridge

573
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,829
oww

574
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:36,789
（好痛）

575
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,250
好棒！
Nice!

576
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:51,434
快點 他們回來之前 我們趕緊離開
Come on, let's go
Before they returned,

577
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:54,855
原來這就是導遊書上提到的午休時間
Oh, this is the party the guide says

578
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:09,406
邁達斯在這附近
給出了項圈的第一個金塊

579
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:09,458
Somewhere here, Midas left the first pendulum from his necklace,

580
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,223
Oh, look at the color

581
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:13,535
瞧瞧這顏色 瞧瞧這太陽
瞧瞧這陽光

582
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:13,602
Look at the sun, and look at this light

583
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:16,424
Oh, how I miss my mummy city,

584
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,161
我好懷念我的泥土墳墓

585
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:28,759
根據傳說
阿波羅給了邁達斯一個巨大的教訓
According to legend, Apollo gave
Midas a good lesson,

586
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:29,884
什麼教訓？
What?

587
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:33,258
財富不及你親近的人來得重要
Your wealth is not more important
than the one you love

588
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:36,022
而且 為愛犧牲很值
More importantly, sacrifice for love.

589
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,391
對 就是這樣
That is

590
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,947
恐怕我們沒拿到筆記本 長官
I'm afraid we do not get the records, sir.

591
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,323
你讓那個笨蛋逃走了
- Did the idiot run away?
- He's a genius Sir,

592
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:56,832
他是個天才 長官
受過高等訓練 絕對的老手！

593
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:57,179
Clever the highest level.
total professionals.

594
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,496
天才？真的嗎？
Genius, really?

595
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,502
絕對的老手
total professionals.

596
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,340
我不管！
I do not care,

597
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,050
我要那個筆記本 明白嗎？
I want that notebook, understand?

598
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:10,262
遵命 長官 拿不到筆記本
我就沒命
Yes sir, my notebook or my life,

599
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,677
稍等一下 這裏看起來好熟悉
Wait a minute, this looks familiar

600
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,018
蒂芙妮 看看這個
Tiv, look at this,

601
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,726
上面的繪畫看起來很像那個噴泉！
the picture looks like a fountain,

602
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,185
這裏有文字
There is a description

603
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,896
「邁達斯進入巴耳廟的若干世紀以後
Centuries after entering the Temple of Midas Baal.

604
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:31,446
蘇丹用12頭野獸來保護它」
The Sultan protects himself
With 12 animals,

605
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,567
9、10、11、12
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

606
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,410
12頭獅子 肯定就是這裏
Twelve black, must be here,

607
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,286
應該有個杠桿之類的東西
There should be a crane or something,

608
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,512
要推土機才能挪開這些東西
We need bulldozers
To get rid of this,

609
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:56,297
泰德 它動了！
TAD, it moves

610
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,352
嘿 蒂芙妮 你看
Hey, Tiv, look

611
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,273
這頭獅子上有記號
There is a sign here,

612
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,732
這頭獅子上面也有
It also has a sign,

613
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,650
可以轉！
It can spin.

614
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,444
太好了
把上面有記號的獅子頭都轉一下
Good, let's turn it all
the head of a lion with a sign

615
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,544
拜託 泰德
Tad .. that's wrong,

616
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,502
你搞錯了 從另一邊推會好很多
It would be better if you
rotate from the other side,

617
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:25,584
如果你出手相助會好很多
It would be better if you intervene

618
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,745
好笑 真好笑
Funny, very funny

619
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,172
幫我推這個 蒂芙妮
Help me this one Tiv

620
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,676
加油 蒂芙妮！
Come on,

621
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:51,817
成功了！
We succeeded ... ha ha ...

622
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,719
Sorry, this is something I do if ...

623
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:01,197
抱歉 我會這樣做 當我…

624
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,335
你真的沒有自尊 對吧？
You do not have respect for yourself, do you?

625
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,752
或許我在那裏會找到表兄哦！
Maybe my cousin was there

626
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:10,337
貝爾佐尼 在這裏等我們
Belzoni, wait here
and watch Jeff,

627
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,512
照顧好傑夫

628
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,220
（復仇）
I do not care

629
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,429
大家小心點 地面很滑
Be careful, buddy
It's slick here,

630
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:30,905
好好吃
The smell

631
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:37,661
什麼聲音？
What's this sound?

632
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,379
-老鼠！我討厭它們！老鼠！
-蒂芙妮 放輕鬆
Ah, that rat!

633
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,461
I hate them, hate that rat!

634
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,415
別叫了好不好？你嚇到他們了
can you stop screaming?
you scare them,

635
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:53,957
它們怎麼了？它們好可愛
What's wrong with them?
They are very funny

636
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:57,445
Oh, I feel at home,

637
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,474
真有回家的感覺

638
00:36:57,668 --> 00:36:59,472
You are disgusting

639
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,473
好噁心！

640
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:03,265
各位 這裏是迷宮
找到去廟的路很不容易
Friends, this is a maze.

641
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:03,239
It will last a long time
To find a way out,

642
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,350
稍等一下 我來問
Just a moment, ask the way,

643
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,601
問？問誰？
Ask who

644
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,771
你覺得呢？它啊
What do you think?
Ask him

645
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:24,414
你知道巴耳廟
Do you know where the Baal Temple is?

646
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,085
在哪裏嗎？

647
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,884
抱歉 我好像沒說對
我的老鼠語不怎麼好
Sorry, I forgot to tell you
The rat is a bit retarded,

648
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,804
你瘋了？你真的指望老鼠…

649
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:37,050
Are you crazy?
You really hope in that rat ...?

650
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:40,724
你知道巴耳廟在哪裏嗎？
You know where it is
Temple of Baal?

651
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,143
巴耳廟在哪裏？
Where is Baal Temple?

652
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:45,221
廟
- Temple.
- K-U-I-L
- Temple.

653
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:48,017
寺廟的「廟」 廟！

654
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,542
Tiieeeeeett .....

655
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,033
明白了 我們走
Let's go,

656
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:00,012
Stupid mouse

657
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,414
快跟上…

658
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:04,487
我們要跟著老鼠走 有沒有搞錯？
Will we follow rats?
Correct

659
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,079
嗨 小鳥
Hello my little bird

660
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,295
你！
Hey, you too
Lead us to your friends ...

661
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,260
帶我們去找你的主人

662
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,297
否則我們會殺死你的小鳥朋友！
Or we'll kill this furry friend

663
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,478
這邊！
Go here

664
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:46,885
Ha, ha, this is a good joke.

665
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,040
真好笑

666
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,246
這傢伙太搞笑了
This rat is amazing,

667
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,499
好 我明白了
Okay, I understand

668
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:59,419
謝了 我的小朋友 再會！
Thank you very much my friend
my little one, see you later,

669
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,339
太好了 現在怎麼辦？
Well now, what?

670
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,513
它說我們從那裏進去
He says that we have to get through it,

671
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:10,019
-開什麼玩笑？
-老鼠已經發話了
- Are you a veranda?
- This is what rats say.

672
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,399
來吧 各位 我們走了這麼遠
不要半途而廢
Come on our friends not so far
for futility

673
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,904
你和你的老鼠！
you look like a mouse!

674
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,246
導遊書說得沒錯
西班牙食物真的好棒
The book was true, the Spanish food is outstanding

675
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,460
現在安全了 快點
It's safe here, come on,

676
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:43,547
Who says archeology is not fun?

677
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:43,094
誰說考古學沒意思了？

678
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,224
還不錯了
That's not so bad

679
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:12,995
巴耳！
- "Baal"
- We're here,

680
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
我們到了

681
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,881
我就說嘛！老鼠說得沒錯
I told you, the rat was right.
The rat was right!

682
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,922
老鼠說得沒錯！

683
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:27,718
嘿 看啊
Hey, look,

684
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:30,354
一條金色小徑
Tread of gold,

685
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:32,598
邁達斯曾經來過這裏
Midas was once here,

686
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,199
邁達斯的項圈
Part of the necklace "Midas".

687
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:08,259
各位 我們出去吧 好嗎？
Friends let's get out of here
This place is very creepy

688
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,513
就算在我看來
這地方也夠令人恐怖的

689
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:14,814
不！
No, no,

690
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:19,807
我們向帕查瑪瑪禱告吧
Oh, let me pray to Mama Pacha. .

691
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,362
大地女神 請在這種時候幫助我們…

692
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:23,149
Oh God of the earth, please help us in this difficult time.

693
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,239
她大概沒在聽吧
Oh, I do not think he's listening,

694
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,416
或許她在聽呢
Maybe he's listening.

695
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:45,669
這個房間是陷阱
The room was a trap,

696
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,626
-我們得離開這裏！
-等等！
- We have to get out
from here, - wait.

697
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,274
水肯定會從什麼地方流出去
Water must seep into a place,

698
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,049
泰德！我快撐不住了！
TAD. I will not last longer!

699
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,822
我找到了出路 幫幫我！
I found my way out,
help me.

700
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:25,653
對了 我沒事 雖然沒人問
I'm fine, if nobody asks about it.

701
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:32,898
抱歉 小傢伙
我們會給你另找一個下水道的
Forgive me my friend, I'll draw you
your other friends

702
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:39,076
我們成功了
- We did it!
- Tad!

703
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:41,331
泰德 我們成功了！

704
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:43,287
- Yes! We made it!
- We have succeeded ...

705
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,215
-我們成功了！天哪！
-我們成功了！耶！

706
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,540
恭喜這對幸福的人兒
Congratulations to two happy people,

707
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:53,721
蒂芙妮？
Tiffany?

708
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,262
-泰德？
-莎拉！
Tad ...?

709
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:57,372
Sara!

710
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:58,467
站住別動！
- Do not move!
- You, release him

711
00:43:58,597 --> 00:43:59,887
你放了她！

712
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,812
越快越好
You know, as soon as possible,

713
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:07,813
把金塊給我 否則我就宰了她
Give me a piece of pendulum ...

714
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:09,786
- or I'll kill him,
- Tad, do not do that,

715
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:09,651
泰德 別給他

716
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,744
抱歉 我別無選擇
Sorry, I have no choice,

717
00:44:15,697 --> 00:44:16,737
求你了
Please,

718
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,802
還有筆記本 拜託了
And the notebook, please,

719
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,020
把筆記本給我
否則你再也別想見到她
Give me the notebook, if
no, you will not see it again!

720
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:45,733
你真卑鄙
You are disgusting!

721
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,572
太好了 都在這裏
Yes, now I have everything

722
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:53,938
走吧！
Let us go

723
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,489
你無權這麼做！
This is not fair

724
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:00,494
我們付出了這麼多努力
不是為了讓你把金塊憑空搶走的
We do not experience all these problems
to hand that pendant to you!

725
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:05,655
跟傑克拉克姆作對 就是這種後果
That's what happens when you play around
with Jack Rackham,

726
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:14,633
沒用的笨狗！
Dog smells

727
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:18,756
莎拉！
Sara!

728
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,216
我還以為我失去你了
I thought I lost you.

729
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:25,583
I hope I have body fluids
So I can cry.

730
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:25,641
真希望我有體液
這樣我就能在團聚時刻哭出來了

731
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:27,266
貝爾佐尼
Belzoni ...

732
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,725
嘿 小傢伙 真高興見到你
Friends, I'm glad to see you ...

733
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:32,938
傑夫 你怎麼了？
Jeff, what happened to you?

734
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,358
我們得趕緊行動
免得拉克姆找到項圈的另外兩塊
We must be quick
Before Rakham finds the next section,

735
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,279
不用擔心這點
I'm not worried about that,

736
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,622
泰德 你在說什麼？
Tad, what do you mean

737
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:41,906
他想要筆記本
He wanted a notebook,
but the important part I've taken.

738
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:44,622
但從來沒說要完整版的

739
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:46,874
好樣的 泰德！
Very good, Tad,

740
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:50,240
Well, where are we going?

741
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:50,036
是嗎？嗯 不 我以為…
我們去哪裏？

742
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,630
土耳其的卡帕多細亞
那裏有數百座廟
To Cappadocia in Turkey
There are hundreds of temples,

743
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:57,224
沒有這些頁
拉克姆就找不到正確的廟
Racham will not find the right temple
without this page.

744
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:58,838
這會讓我們領先一步
It gives us a chance to leave early,
Let's go!

745
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:01,217
走吧 夥計們 我們去土耳其

746
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:01,406
Let's go to Turkey!

747
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:11,267
我們到了
- This is it!
- Thank you, how much does it cost?

748
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:12,615
謝謝 多少錢？

749
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:15,568
這一趟是免費的 我的寶貝
This trip is free for my Roman girl.

750
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:17,327
Why, thank you...!

751
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,356
謝謝

752
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:20,316
他一直說的「寶貝」
到底是什麼意思？
What does the Roman girl mean?

753
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,242
我送給你的禮物
My gift to you

754
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,580
它象徵著我們的心、靈魂和肚子
It nourishes the heart, soul and stomach of many people

755
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:33,036
我會在阿蘭布拉宮的燈光下等你
I will be waiting for you
Under the Alhambra lamp,

756
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:34,633
你知道的
And you know that

757
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:40,134
西班牙人真瘋狂
The Spaniards are crazy.

758
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:42,296
好吧
Good

759
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,846
那位船長會幫我們在他的船上
找個位子
Captain is looking for a place for us
on board

760
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,060
太好了
Well Look at this, Ted,

761
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:47,353
看看這個 泰德

762
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:50,274
我們在這裏應該可以找到下一個金塊
This is where the temple where the second piece is located.

763
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,349
阿瑞妮杜廟
Temple of Arenido?

764
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,729
巴耳的妻子 光之女神
Baal's wife, and
Goddess of Light,

765
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,402
酷斃了！第三個廟呢？
Nice!
What about the third temple?

766
00:46:57,693 --> 00:46:58,823
我對它不怎麼瞭解
This is a mystery, the only clue
all I have is this symbol ...

767
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:02,704
唯一的線索是這個標誌
跟邁達斯相關的所有東西上都有

768
00:47:00,144 --> 00:47:02,704
What I found in everything
related to Midas ...

769
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,913
好像是某種私人印記
Such a stamp or a personal signature!

770
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:07,677
Wow, you're the best, Sarah.

771
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,699
你好厲害 莎拉

772
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:10,365
E ...

773
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:12,084
泰德…
Tad ...

774
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,882
什麼事 莎拉？
Yes, Sarah ...?

775
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,457
我希望你知道
I want you to know...
After all this time...

776
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,298
我們分開了這麼久 我…

777
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,399
We are separated from that promise.

778
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:26,354
拜託 我們到底要不要走？
我快要死了
Are we going to go now or what?
I can die again if here goes on,

779
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:27,638
再次死亡

780
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,164
Oh, sorry, I'm ... ah ...

781
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,638
抱歉 我…

782
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:36,192
好 謝謝 多謝
Well, thank you very much

783
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:38,782
嗨 各位 我幫我們找到船了
Friend, we board this boat.

784
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:42,655
泰德 你是最棒的
Tad you're the best!

785
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:46,199
看在木乃伊胡安妮塔的牙齒份上
這簡直是漂浮的大都會
- Teeth "Juanita mummy".
- This is a floating city of Metropolis.

786
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,938
Ah ... no, that's not it.

787
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,123
不是那艘

788
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,078
是那艘
But here it is!

789
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:57,167
大都會甭想了
那連一座小村子都算不上
Forget the metaphors of Metropolis,
little village is not this

790
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:04,554
-嘿 蒂芙妮
-嗨
Hi, Tiff?

791
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,723
- Hello ...
- Can I ask something?

792
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,219
我能問你一件事嗎？

793
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:08,506
問吧
Yes, of course,

794
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,689
好貼心
Oh, this is so beautiful

795
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,858
那麼你認為莎拉會喜歡嗎？
You think, would Sarah like it?

796
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:20,438
莎拉
Aooh ... Sarah ...

797
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,069
嗯 我不知道這東西能否配得上她
Yeah, I do not know
is this enough for her

798
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:31,794
沒事吧？
Are you alright?

799
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:33,461
很完美
Okay, I'm just seasick ... I can not fit in
because I am a land creature.

800
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,250
只是我喜歡在地上的感覺

801
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:40,353
Instead, I'm on the mainland.

802
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:39,748
事實上 是喜歡在地下

803
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,167
天哪…
Oh, my goodness ...

804
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,756
看起來也不比我好到哪裏去
You do not look much better than Me.

805
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,683
發生的這一切讓我想了很多
All this makes me think,

806
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:50,893
嗯 別這樣 開心點
一切都會好起來的
Come on .. everything is fine,

807
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,558
我一心撲在工作上
I'm very focused
At workplace...

808
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:55,774
我感覺把人從我的生命中趕走了
I felt as if I cared
people close to me.

809
00:48:56,562 --> 00:49:00,272
有一件事很確定
說話不會解決任何事情 親愛的
One thing is certain, waffle can not finish anything.

810
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,227
你得積極主動
Take the initiative dong ..
do not just talk, act ..

811
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,647
少說話 多做事

812
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:07,704
真是好主意
Actually this is good advice.

813
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,202
我得承認 這主意不是我想出來的
Oh, I have to admit it
those words are not from me,

814
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,325
這是維加斯那位歌手唱出來的
a man cheated of glare wealth in Las Vegas.
It took a while to learn the words.

815
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:14,661
我花了好久才學會歌詞

816
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:19,753
你能在我身上試試嗎？看看效果
Do you want to try it on me first?
Just to see your appearance only.

817
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:22,335
Oh ...! Yes, good idea,

818
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,630
嗯 好主意

819
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:27,224
我覺得你說得對
我該閉嘴 採取行動
I thought you were right, I had to do it
Stop complaining and start acting

820
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:29,342
這就對了 這才是我的莎拉
- Well, this is my Sarah!
- Thank you, you helped me a lot

821
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:31,428
謝謝 你幫了大忙

822
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:33,597
好好享受這個主意 免費的
Just do my advice, it's free

823
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:35,725
我得繼續把西班牙海鮮燴飯吐出來
I will continue my vomiting ..

824
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,391
來了
Oh, here it is ...

825
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:45,575
好 多行動 直接說重點
Okay, action, straight to the point.

826
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,252
你戴起來好漂亮
this looks pretty if you wear.

827
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:19,024
（西班牙 格拉納達）

828
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:22,395
（地中海）

829
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:24,733
（土耳其 安塔利亞）

830
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:31,407
謝謝
Thank you very much
They really have everything here.

831
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:34,452
不可思議 在這裏一切都要討價還價

832
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:38,763
Oooh, this is great, we are
Near the second part of the necklace,

833
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,327
太神奇了！

834
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:38,713
我們要找到項圈的第二塊組成部分

835
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:39,997
水？
- water?
- Do not be too enthusiastic

836
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:42,962
別這麼興奮 拉克姆可能就在附近

837
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:45,048
"Rackham" could be here. Take what you need
quickly, do not waste time

838
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:46,003
拿好你們的東西 我們不能浪費時間

839
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,176
好吧 我們走
All right ... let's go

840
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,970
「好吧 我們走」
All right ... let's go

841
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:57,096
不可能
This is not possible..

842
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,930
讓我看看…
Let's see, It's impossible ..

843
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:01,601
「不可能」

844
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:04,774
有沒有搞錯？你在幹什麼？
Are you serious
What are you doing

845
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:07,438
你總是抱怨我的人類偽裝
You always complain about my clothes and humiliate me.

846
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:10,738
從現在起 我會跟你一模一樣
From now on I will be like you.

847
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,493
完美的人類先生
Mr. Perfect, see this

848
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:13,624
看看吧

849
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,486
我是泰德史東斯 我不會跳舞…

850
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:21,078
千真萬確 你的朋友是個十足的怪咖
Officially already, your friend is very strange

851
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:25,375
來吧 木乃伊骨骼親自出馬
Come on, bones
we solve this case immediately,

852
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,460
那…
But ..
I do not like at all,

853
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:28,087
我不是那樣的！

854
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,173
你拿著西班牙海鮮燴飯幹什麼？
What are you going to do with the pot?

855
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:32,839
這是我的禮物 我超愛的
我帶著到處走
It's a present for me, and I like it.
I'll wear it anywhere

856
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:35,468
我絕不會把那玩意背在背上
But I do not wear this thing on my back

857
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:38,716
好 好吧 我們來看看
這個小怪物是怎麼想的
Okay we will ask for the help of this little monster.

858
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,977
嗨 小動物 我是泰德 超級餅乾！
- Hi, I'm Tad, Superkaka!
- No, no, Jeff,

859
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,654
不 傑夫 我是泰德 過來

860
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:44,908
I'm Tad, come here.

861
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,860
別管那個冒牌貨

862
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:47,307
- Do not listen to this trick
- Eat this

863
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:47,611
-拿這個 給
-我才是真正的泰德

864
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:48,981
超級餅乾！
Superkaka ...

865
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,208
Ashshashsh

866
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:55,073
我想要三個小隊
分頭行動 保持警惕
I want for three groups. Divide and keep your eyes open.

867
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,909
-附近有很多廟
-遵命 長官
There are dozens of temples here,

868
00:51:56,887 --> 00:51:57,870
Yes, Sir,

869
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,140
三小時後回來這裏匯報
Report back here within three hours,

870
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:34,608
好 就是這裏
Well, this is the place,

871
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,276
Hey ... with a pkamungan !!!

872
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,316
景色真美

873
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,624
很美吧 莎拉？
Is not that beautiful, Sara?

874
00:52:39,665 --> 00:52:41,291
- ......
- Of course,

875
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:41,409
當然了

876
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:42,947
嗯 好吧…
Yes alright...

877
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:46,622
天快黑了
It'll be dark soon, let's split up
To find the location of the temple,

878
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,918
我們應該分頭行動 以找到那座廟

879
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:50,302
好 我跟…
Good, I went with ...!

880
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:53,169
跟我一起 我和泰德 永遠的兄弟
With me, me and Tad
Brother for life,

881
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:56,965
我們看看誰先找到那座廟
男生對女生哦
Let's see who will find the temple first, men against women,

882
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:00,137
走吧 蒂芙妮
Come on Tiffany ..

883
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,850
謝天謝地 我插足救了你一馬
Oh, luckily I immediately brokered

884
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:06,063
怎麼回事？
我想跟莎拉好好待一段時間
What are you doing
I tried together with Sarah,

885
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,937
你難道沒注意到她有點異樣嗎？
Oh, did you see anything different from him?

886
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:12,028
嗯 她最近有點冷漠
Well, she behaves rather oddly ...

887
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,070
當然了！她怎麼不會呢？
Of course, why not!

888
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,404
你不是她需要的白馬王子
You are not as perfect as he had been expecting

889
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,528
什麼？
- What?
- But do not be afraid.

890
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,656
不過別擔心 我們會讓莎拉愛上你的

891
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,112
We will make Sarah love you
up to your bones.

892
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:23,372
他們稱我為「偉大的秘魯征服者」
這名頭可不是白叫的
They do not call me a "Peruvian heartbreaker" if this just can not

893
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,789
你只需練習一下
It only takes some practice,

894
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,578
真不敢相信
I do not believe!

895
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:31,496
如果找到了第二塊
我們離邁達斯就只有一步之遙了
If we find the second part, we will be
very close to Midas,

896
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,378
蒂芙妮 有很多跡象告訴我們
Tiffaniy, your behavior is too inviting ...

897
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:36,053
不能濫用邁達斯的法力
Midas's power is very dangerous

898
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:39,642
你是說我們不該尋找項圈嗎？
Do you think we should not be looking for this necklace?

899
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:43,223
我只是說 或許項圈就不該曝光
All I want to say is the necklace
Probably should not be exposed to the sun.

900
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:47,445
嗨 帥哥
Hi handsome

901
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,942
木乃伊 這不會有用的
Mummy, this will not work.

902
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,857
木乃伊？誰是木乃伊？
我是莎拉拉弗羅夫
Mummy? Who's a mummy?
I'm Sara Lavrov,

903
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:54,816
不 我辦不到
No, no, no, I can not do it,

904
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:57,493
別這樣 你到底愛不愛莎拉？
- Come on, do you like Sarah, yes or no?
- With all the heart.

905
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:58,821
全心全意

906
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:01,566
但你不願意不惜一切？
Then you must be willing
Do anything

907
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,409
莎拉 我…
- Sarah, I ...
- Yes?

908
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:08,581
嗯？

909
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:11,165
-我知道你要考慮很多事情
-嗯？
I know you have a lot of things
which is being thought of ...

910
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:11,444
Yes?

911
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:14,213
你幾乎沒時間考慮現在
And that you barely have time for
To think about the current ...

912
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,006
也就是我目前所在的地方

913
00:54:15,444 --> 00:54:16,429
Where I live

914
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,140
但我真正渴望的
But what I really want,
To live...

915
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:24,564
是跟你活在同樣的時代
always with you.

916
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:28,311
無論是哪個時代
過去 現在活將來
Anything, past ...

917
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,939
Current or future, I ...

918
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,693
在生命的大冒險中
I want to be your partner

919
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:35,976
我渴望成為你的搭檔
Wading through life adventures

920
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:42,238
喂！你在幹嘛？
Hey, what are you doing?

921
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,527
抱歉 你剛才說的話太美了
Sorry, this is great ..

922
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:46,705
你得把這些話都告訴莎拉
You have to tell Sarah
as before, Sarah will accept it.

923
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:50,332
她會喜歡的
任何女人現在都會愛上你

924
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:50,569
Every woman will fall in love now.

925
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:51,832
泰德！
...

926
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:57,053
筆記本這裏也沒有標記
Not here either
There is nothing like written in the book

927
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:59,592
不可能 我們看了20多座廟了
No way, we've been looking for up to twenty temples,

928
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:03,256
我們必須找對廟
免得絕對的老手泰德捷足先登
We have to find the right temple
Before the "Tad the professional" did it.

929
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,010
你？絕對的老手？
You are a professional?

930
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:08,177
就算跟莎拉不成功 你還有四眼妹呢
If your plan with Sarah does not work,
You must have plan B

931
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,665
sssss ... see,

932
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:11,391
看看 就是這座廟

933
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,424
This is the temple

934
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:13,555
我們回去找拉克姆吧
Come back to "Rackham", maybe
the other team is luckier

935
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:16,106
或許其他人運氣比較好

936
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,450
跟傑夫一起待在這裏
如果看到這些人回來 就告訴我
- Stay here with "Jeff"
- And screamed
- Only if you see them back.

937
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:26,868
太好了
Nice...

938
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:38,307
好可怕
It's scary ...

939
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:00,727
泰德 我們一直在找你
Tad, We're looking for you

940
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,614
第二塊！
This is the second part ...

941
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,569
我找到了 莎拉 我找到了
Sarah found it!
I found it

942
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:07,033
而且不僅如此
Not only that,

943
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,527
看
see

944
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:11,031
那座山

945
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:11,278
This mountain ...!

946
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,743
邁達斯的標誌！
Midas Symbol!

947
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:17,038
邁達斯沒有將最後一塊贈給現存的廟
Midas did not offer the last part
to the gods at this temple.

948
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:18,924
他為阿波羅建了一座廟
But handed over to Apollo.

949
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,958
第三塊肯定在那裏！
The third part must be there!

950
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:24,133
對 我們得趕緊
搶在拉克姆之前拿到它
Yes! We must be quick
Get it before "Rekham".

951
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:27,973
或者我們可以銷毀這一塊
Or we can just destroy this

952
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:29,717
銷毀它？
Destroyed?

953
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,931
史上最重大的發現？
你不會是說真的吧
The greatest discovery in history?
You can not do that

954
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,430
蒂芙妮 我們不能
讓拉克姆獲得邁達斯的法力
Tiffany, we can not let it
Rakham gained this power.

955
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,848
不過 莎拉
我們離成功只有一步之遙
But Sarah, we're very close ...

956
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:41,563
泰德 我們現在就了結這一切吧
"Tad," let's end it now.

957
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:44,856
不 泰德 別給她 太瘋狂了
No, Tad, you can not do that
Do not give it. that's crazy!

958
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:48,569
莎拉 我們拿到所有三塊
不是更好嗎？
Sarah,

959
00:58:46,671 --> 00:58:48,728
Would not it be better
Getting three parts

960
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,530
眾神的法力不屬於凡人之手
The power of God can not be
Fall into the hands of man,

961
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:55,828
如果拉克姆拿到項圈
他就會所向披靡
If "Rackham" gets the necklace
He will be invincible.

962
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:01,124
等等 蒂芙妮在哪？
Wait! Where is Tiffany?

963
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:06,922
簡直難以置信！
I do not believe!

964
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:08,719
莎拉 對不起…
Sarah I'm sorry

965
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,179
我必須搶在拉克姆之前
找到第三塊 然後毀掉它
I have to find the third part and
destroy it before it is found Rekham.

966
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:13,512
莎拉 等等我！
Sara, wait for me!

967
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,100
不 泰德 我需要單獨行事
I want to be alone!

968
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:28,820
你們這些蠢蛋！你們想告訴我
你們所有人
Your Idiots!

969
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:29,402
Do you want to say that every one of you ...

970
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:31,112
找了這麼多天

971
00:59:29,605 --> 00:59:31,069
Today ...

972
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,530
卻一無所獲？
Not finding anything?

973
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:34,453
這個筆記本毫無用處！
This is useless !!

974
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:37,365
那個笨蛋刷了我！
The Tad hat has tricked me!

975
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:46,803
我想成為獲勝一方的隊員
I want to be with the winning team.

976
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:01,526
Oh, here you are
Where have you been?

977
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:00,055
你終於來了！

978
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,142
你去哪裏了？

979
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:04,479
嘿 我們要跟莎拉一起回去嗎？
Hey, are not you with Sarah?

980
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:06,985
她走了
He has gone,

981
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:08,856
蒂芙妮呢？
And Tiffany?

982
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:11,436
她也走了
He also has ... also gone,

983
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,993
千真萬確 你的泡妞技術慘不忍睹
official already, you are
disaster for women,

984
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:18,875
-我怎麼這麼蠢？
-你在徵求我的意見嗎？
How can I be so stupid!

985
01:00:17,919 --> 01:00:20,721
- Do you want my opinion?
- All I have to do is get the pendulum.

986
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:20,584
我只需把第二塊給她

987
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:23,212
我們將它銷毀 就這樣
一切都搞定了
solve it, then finish the case

988
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,883
500年來
我目睹過各種各樣的愛情悲劇
Do you know in 500 years
I've seen all kinds of catastrophic love,

989
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:30,552
你的是最慘的
But your worst situation,

990
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,092
拜託 別再說這個話題了
Do not start again,

991
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:35,176
說真的 我從沒有人失敗過這麼多次
Seriously, I've never seen a person fail as often as you

992
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:37,722
好 好吧 我懂
Yes, yes, I understand.

993
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:44,891
但我也沒見過任何人為了愛情
跨越千山萬水
But I have not seen anyone
exploring the whole world for love like you,

994
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,823
你的訓練肯定完成了
Now you must complete it!

995
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,150
I ... I do not know if I'm ready.

996
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:53,397
-我不確定我是否準備好了
-你當然準備好了

997
01:00:52,337 --> 01:00:53,683
Of course you are ready

998
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:56,409
為了心愛的女人 你付出了很多努力
You've done everything to get
the woman you love ...

999
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,743
現在她比以前更需要你
Now they need you more than ever,

1000
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:01,409
你說得對
You're right, I do not think
To say this, but ...

1001
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:03,875
我從未想過我會這麼說
不過你說得對

1002
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,128
You are right
I have to help him,

1003
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,119
我得幫她

1004
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:08,587
這才是我的兄弟 加油 大英雄
This is my brother
Come on, Tiger, Tiger!

1005
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:12,377
我來了 莎拉 泰德史東斯親自出馬
Here I come, Sarah, Tad Stone
will solve this problem.

1006
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,959
Come on, one more step.

1007
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:55,816
來吧 再走一步

1008
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:58,364
我走不動了 泰德
I can not go any further, a tad

1009
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,951
我的腿都麻了！
I do not feel my legs!

1010
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,070
我的腿！
Oh, my legs!
Oh no!

1011
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:05,044
不！

1012
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:13,497
莎拉
Sarah ...

1013
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:18,089
在那邊！
See, there,

1014
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,763
拉克姆 我們得快點
Rakham ...

1015
01:03:21,002 --> 01:03:22,002
We must help him.

1016
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:24,644
不 你想讓我往下爬？
Oh no, no, now I am
should climb down?

1017
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:26,433
這簡直是侵犯人權
This is a violation of human rights,

1018
01:03:26,682 --> 01:03:27,852
首先 你不是人類
First, you are not a human being,
second, we do not have time for that

1019
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:30,598
其次 沒時間往下爬

1020
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,399
嘿 那是我的禮物 你在幹嘛？
Hey, this is my gift!
What would you do

1021
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:34,936
加以利用
Yes used it

1022
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:44,067
我不知道你在做什麼 蒂芙妮
You do not know what to do, Tiffany

1023
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,967
好吧 傑夫 過來
Okay Jeff, come here

1024
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:06,347
來吧 過來這裏
Come here

1025
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:08,312
這玩意有好多用途！
this stuff is multifunctional,

1026
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:10,135
小心點 我們不想…
Be careful I do not want any later ...

1027
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:25,625
嘿！

1028
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:33,868
什麼聲音？
What is this?

1029
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:44,093
又是你？
- You again, - "hero
professional."

1030
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:45,391
絕對的老手

1031
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:47,508
蒂芙妮？
Tiffany?

1032
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:49,931
泰德？
- Tad!
- Sarah!

1033
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:51,305
莎拉

1034
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:52,813
你來這裏做什麼？
What are you doing here

1035
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:55,686
我沒法不管你 莎拉 我…
I can not leave you
alone, Sara, I ...

1036
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:56,982
閉嘴！
Stop!
Let's move on, we're almost there,

1037
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:59,766
快走 馬上就要到了

1038
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,086
阿波羅

1039
01:05:20,104 --> 01:05:21,113
Apollo!

1040
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:24,093
聖壇呢？那個金塊在哪裏？
Where the altar, and
last part?

1041
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:27,466
邁達斯建造了這座廟
把最後一個金塊獻給阿波羅
Midas built this temple as the last sacrifice for Apollo.

1042
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:29,854
只有一個地方可以找到這個金塊
There is only one place to find the pieces

1043
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,092
你 給我把金塊拿過來
- You! Bring me the pendulum,
- Just dream you!

1044
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,720
絕對不行

1045
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:08,757
好吧 我去
All right, I'll go.

1046
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:11,138
喂 你別這麼粗魯
Hey, you! Do not be rude

1047
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:31,948
泰德？
Tad?

1048
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,123
我不是泰德！
I'm not Tad!
I am King Midas,

1049
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:37,292
我是邁達斯！

1050
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:39,711
我附身在泰德的身上
I entered her body and I
will not give you this necklace,

1051
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:43,041
我不會把項圈給你！

1052
01:06:45,031 --> 01:06:47,232
I'm choking,

1053
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:47,131
好痛

1054
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:49,176
你到底在說什麼？
What are you saying?

1055
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:52,508
坦白說 我完全不知道
我總得嘗試一下吧
Frankly, do not know.

1056
01:06:51,419 --> 01:06:52,708
I have to try something.

1057
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:55,771
他真恨無恥
He has no shame.

1058
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:01,519
現在 給我戴上
Now, plug it in for me.

1059
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:06,822
謝了 孬種
Thank you, loser,

1060
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:51,485
好吧 你的目的達到了 放他們走
Well, you already have what you are
want, let them go now,

1061
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:54,236
有個問題 寶貝
There's a problem, honey

1062
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:57,196
我絕不會讓失敗一方獲勝
I will not let the team lose
to go

1063
01:07:57,703 --> 01:07:59,293
什麼？我們有言在先！
What? We have an agreement,
You can strength, I can fame

1064
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:01,291
你獲得法力 我獲得名望

1065
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:02,465
你不會傷害他們
And you will not hurt them,

1066
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:05,133
你敢相信這些孩子嗎？他們太天真了
Do you believe these kids?
They are very naive

1067
01:08:05,558 --> 01:08:09,436
Ha ha ha! I hope I can believe that

1068
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:08,918
知道嗎？那個怪咖說得對

1069
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:11,378
好吧 所有人都不許動
- Well, nothing moves!

1070
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:15,508
把項圈給我
放了我們所有人 而且…
Give me the necklace and let's go ...!

1071
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:16,887
不！

1072
01:08:16,364 --> 01:08:17,242
No!

1073
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,849
你不明白
You do not understand

1074
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:24,561
現在我擁有了邁達斯的魔法！
I now have the power of Midas!

1075
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:32,283
快跑！
Run!

1076
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:36,162
你好啊
Oh, hello

1077
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:42,786
我超愛這玩意的
I like this,

1078
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:47,233
Friends, I do not want to die now!

1079
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:47,673
老天 我不想死

1080
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:49,633
你早就死了！快跑！
- I do not want to die!
- You're dead from the first. Run!

1081
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:04,892
我們得阻止他
We have to stop it,

1082
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:06,978
對…我來辦
- Yes, yes, I've tried,
- Are you alright?

1083
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:08,187
你沒事吧？

1084
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,863
嗯 我需要稍微緩一下
Yes, give me time,

1085
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:11,525
拜託！這傢伙勢不可擋！
Hello, this guy is very angry!

1086
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,910
借給我 我們分頭行動
把他包圍起來
I borrow this, and let's spread and surround him.

1087
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:20,409
你們在那裏
- You're there
- go!

1088
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:21,657
快！

1089
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:36,842
你要去哪？
Where are you going

1090
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:48,978
謝謝
thank you

1091
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:00,491
對不起 我沒有…
- I am sorry,
- professional hero,

1092
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:01,827
絕對的老手

1093
01:10:05,223 --> 01:10:08,558
Do not forget me

1094
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:08,379
別忘了我！

1095
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:13,838
我厭倦了你！
I'm really sick of you!

1096
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:32,571
莎拉！不！

1097
01:10:31,801 --> 01:10:33,106
Sara!
No!

1098
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,400
What do you really want ?!

1099
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,050
你成就了什麼？

1100
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,597
跟她告別吧
Say goodbye to him ...!

1101
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:36,456
我們成功了 莎拉 一切都結束了
We succeed Sarah, it's over

1102
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:38,165
泰德
Tad,

1103
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:40,298
莎拉？
Sara?

1104
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:44,434
不 不可能
No, no, no! This should not happen
Not you, no!

1105
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:45,813
不能發生在你身上 不！

1106
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:48,136
天哪 這可不妙
Oh no! This is bad,

1107
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:51,369
Well, there must be a way
To stop it,

1108
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:51,603
-肯定有辦法阻止它
-泰德

1109
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:52,852
犧牲
...
- sacrifice!

1110
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,020
邁達斯得回了他的女兒
我必須銷毀那個項圈！
Midas can get his daughter back,
I must destroy that chain!

1111
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:08,084
不！
No!

1112
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:12,504
都是我的錯 我應該毀了那一塊的
This is all my fault,

1113
01:12:11,396 --> 01:12:13,290
- I have to destroy this part,
- T ...

1114
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,963
-泰德…
-抱歉 真的很抱歉

1115
01:12:13,315 --> 01:12:16,893
- Sorry I'm so sorry
- Do not blame yourself, "TAD".

1116
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:18,510
別這樣 泰德 這趟冒險精彩無比

1117
01:12:17,007 --> 01:12:19,278
I had a wonderful adventure,

1118
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,844
-跟你在一起的這些日子
-莎拉 不
All day with you

1119
01:12:21,164 --> 01:12:24,212
- Sara, no!

1120
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:25,260

1121
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:25,570

我愛…
Love...

1125
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:34,229
不
No! No!

1126
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,935
不

1127
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:44,778
泰德！
Tad, we have to go!

1128
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:46,907
我們得馬上離開！

1129
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,578
泰德 快點！
Tad, come on!

1130
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:53,249
走吧 我要留在這裏
Just go
I'll stay

1131
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,711
我只想跟你在一起
All I want is with you.

1132
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,470
我愛你
I love you

1133
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,330
怎麼…
What?

1134
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:09,025
-嗨
-莎拉？
- Hello, - Sara!

1135
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:12,327
Tad is ready to die for her,

1136
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:12,197
泰德願意為她而死

1137
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,328
為愛犧牲
Sacrifice for love,

1138
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:16,325
莎拉
Sara!

1139

1140
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,029

- Hey friends, thanks for coming,
- a tad, beautiful party!

1141
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:53,661
派對真不錯 泰德

1142
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:55,199
你的女朋友在哪？
But where is your girlfriend? Yes?

1143
01:14:55,746 --> 01:14:59,536
你不知道嗎？她在外面探險
想做出重大發現呢
Do not you know
It's out there

1144
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,579
Looking for a great discovery,

1145
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:02,626
不 說真的 她馬上就來了
- Seriously, he will come
- I do not need to believe it.

1146
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:03,841
當然了…

1147
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,877
不 別這樣 她馬上就到了
No, he'll be right here

1148
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,680
嘿 你好嗎？我的大英雄還好嗎？
How is my tiger?

1149
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,059
泰德？
"Tad"!

1150
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,481
-嗨 莎拉
-嗨 寶貝
- Hello, Sara, - Hi, honey

1151
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:24,688
嘿 看好了
Look at this

1152
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,700
他們沒辦法享受派對了
The party ends for them.

1153
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:33,240
你現在打算怎麼辦？
But what are you going to do now?

1154
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:36,698
我要回帕提提
這玩意會讓我重返家園的
Oh, I'll be back to
Paitete, it's a return ticket,

1155
01:15:36,828 --> 01:15:39,408
他們會為此瘋狂的
他們超喜歡金子的
They will go crazy, they like
see lots of gold ..

1156
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,918
我會很想你的
I will miss you too

1157
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,890
I do not want to cry
I do not want to cry

1158
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:43,747
我不想哭 不想哭哦…

1159
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,631
我還是沒有體液 我哭不出來
Oh! No fluid, me
can not cry!

1160
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:48,545
我不想看到你哭
I heard him
who can not cry

1161
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:53,295
我在阿蘭布拉宮等你 但你沒出現
I'm waiting for you at Al-Hamra Palace ...

1162
01:15:52,318 --> 01:15:54,112
You did not come,

1163
01:15:54,096 --> 01:15:55,306
你？你怎麼…
You?
How do you...

1164
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,931
你的小朋友帶我找到了你
Our little friend guides me to you

1165
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:00,101
老鼠！
Rats, I'm happier than
Cockroach in the toilet!

1166
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:02,597
我比公共廁所裏的蟑螂還要開心！

1167
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:06,018
我好想看到你微笑 我的寶貝
Oh, I like your smile
Hey my Roman girl!

1168
01:16:06,485 --> 01:16:09,653
I'm a little afraid of the meaning of the Roman girl.

1169
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:09,397
我開始有點擔心「寶貝」的意思了

1170
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:12,413
不管了！我們開始狂歡吧！
but what is the importance?
Let's start the real party!

1171
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:15,737
她讓我瘋狂
This is crazy driving me crazy ...

1172
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:18,999
你也會想他的
You will miss him too

1173
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:22,706
他或許是有史以來
最討厭、讓人不快
Maybe he is the most
likes to bully, intimidate,

1174
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,711
著裝最差的跟班
Nobody wore clothes worse than him.

1175
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:27,464
但你說得對 我會想他的
But you're right
I will miss him,

1176
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:29,174
我知道這不一樣
Well, I know this is different topic

1177
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:31,878
但這個或許能讓你開心
But maybe this will make you happy.

1178
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,300
你是認真的？
Are you serious

1179
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,760
我願意！
Yes!

1180
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:47,152
抱歉 我會這樣做 當我…
Sorry, you know
I did this when ...

1181
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:49,571
你還想做我的女朋友嗎？
Do you still want to be my boyfriend?

1182
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,115
來吧！大家來跳舞！
Come on! To dance to everyone

1183
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:57,995
一、二、三！

1184
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:34,860
（劇終）

1185
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:40,412
So next time
