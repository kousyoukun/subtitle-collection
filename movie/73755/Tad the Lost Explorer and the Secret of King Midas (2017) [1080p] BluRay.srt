I kept my part

Tell me about it. First year of
archaeology is super demanding.

I don't get what you find so
interesting about this old stuff.

Oh. Now I get it.

33

Now that is something
worth studying.

Then we barely saw each other
after that.

41
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:04,244
You know, she's been going away on long
expeditions, and I've been studying and working.

42
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,442
Um, kind of left things
in the air.

43

Oh, sure.
You kissed this girl?

44
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:13,841

00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:23,710
Yeah. And I just got a call
from Scarlett Johansson.

50
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:25,110
- Hey, watch it!
- Sorry.

51
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:28,309
Tad, you should try living

I know, right?

Did you get the invitation
to the exhibition?

59
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:45,612
Yeah! I can't wait
to be there!

An ancient relic has revealed
the real story of King Midas.

00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:22,384
It's a papyrus called
"A Sacrifice for Love."

for Apollo.</i>

<i>Grateful, Apollo bestowed upon King Midas
a collar with three golden pieces.</i>

<i>The collar
would bring the wearer</i>

<i>the power to turn
anything he touched into gold.</i>

334
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,751
<i>Midas amassed piles
and piles of gold.</i>

335
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:47,553
<i>Everything he laid his hands on
would turn into the precious metal.</i>

00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:50,219
<i>But this golden touch
soon became a curse.</i>

00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:55,752
<i>His daughter reached out to hug him
and she too was turned into gold.</i>

00:18:55,754 --> 00:19:00,353
<i>Devastated, Midas returned to
Apollo and begged for mercy.</i>

339
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:03,554
<i>Apollo told Midas
to get rid of his collar,</i>

of its three pieces</i>

<i>and by giving up
an immense power,</i>

Well done, Tad!

808
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:49,936
Uh? (NERVOUS LAUGH) Yeah? Well, no,
I think... So, where do we go?

809
00:45:49,938 --> 00:45:53,535
To Cappadocia, in Turkey. There
are hundreds of temples there.

810
00:45:53,537 --> 00:45:57,336
Rackham won't be able to find the
right one without these pages.

811
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,903
That would give us
a head start.

812
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:01,370
So let's go, guys!
Let's go to Turkey.

Um, here we are.

815
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:12,804
Thanks. How much is it?

This fare, I do it for free,

Oh. Thank you.

00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:20,437
What is this <i>"palomita"</i>
he keeps talking about?

It embodies the heart, soul
and the belly of our people.

I'll be waiting for you under
the lights of the Alhambra.

Okay.

find us a spot on his ship.

Great.

00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:47,504
Check this, Tad.

830
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:50,540
This is the area where we
should find the next piece.

Cool! So what about
the third temple?

834
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:59,140
I don't know much about it.

835
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:02,673
The only clue is this symbol that
appears in everything related to Midas.

836
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:05,105
It seems to be
some sort of personal mark.

- Hi.

Can I ask you something?

Go for it.

Oh! That's so sweet.

00:48:15,878 --> 00:48:17,811
So, do you think Sara
will like it?

Oh. Sara.

(GROANS) Perfect.

Ooh.

You don't look much better
than I do.

All that's happened
got me thinking.

Yeah. Come on, cheer up,
everything'll be fine.

Oh. One thing's for sure. Talking
won't solve anything, darling.

You've got
to take the initiative.

Less conversation,
more action.

That's actually good advice.

Ugh. Well, I got to confess
it isn't mine.

That's what the guy in Vegas
was singing about.

Well, can you try it on me?
Just to see how it looks.

Oh. Yeah, good idea.

886
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:27,247
I think you're right. I should stop
talking and start taking action.

There you go.
That's my Sara.

Ho-ho! This is amazing!

Take your stuff.
We can't lose any time.

903
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:51,218

Are you serious?
What are you doing?

909
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,451
Well, you're always complaining
about my human disguises

910
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:10,884
so, from now on, I'm going
to be exactly like you,

friend is a total freak.

Come on. Mummy Bones
on the case.

917
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:26,486
That is... I...

918
00:51:26,488 --> 00:51:28,186
I am not at all like that!

919
00:51:28,188 --> 00:51:30,052
And what are you doing
with a paella dish?

920
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:32,788
It's my present. I love it.
I'm taking it everywhere.

921
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,487
I would never wear
that thing on my back.

Okay, fine. Let's see what
the little monster thinks.

Oh! What a view.

Isn't it beautiful, Sara?

938
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,858
- Huh?
- Sure.

939
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,992
Yeah, well...

00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:46,691
It's getting dark.

941
00:52:46,693 --> 00:52:48,823
We should all split up
to locate the temple.

942
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:50,325
- Great. I'll go with...
- Oh! Oh!

943
00:52:50,327 --> 00:52:53,190
With me. Me and Tad.
Brothers for life.

Let's see who finds the temple first.
Boys versus girls.

Let's go, Tiffany.

946
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:02,823
Oh. Thank goodness
I stepped in.

947
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:06,591
What's going on here? I was trying
to spend some time with Sara.

948
00:53:06,593 --> 00:53:09,526
Haven't you noticed something
different about her?

949
00:53:09,528 --> 00:53:12,158
Well, she has been acting
kind of distant.

950
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,992
Of course!
How would she not?

951
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:16,424
You're not being the knight
in shining armor she needs.

952
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,724
The what?

953
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:20,625
But fear not. We'll make
Sara melt for your bones.

They don't call me the Great
Conquistador of Peru for nothing.

955
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:26,226
You just need some practice.

956
00:53:26,228 --> 00:53:27,825
I can't believe it.

957
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:31,526
If we find the second piece, we'll
be just one step away from Midas.

958
00:53:31,528 --> 00:53:33,394
Tiffany, there are too many
signs telling

959
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:36,694
Midas' power is not something
to mess with.

960
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:39,492
Are you saying we shouldn't
search for the collar?

961
00:53:39,494 --> 00:53:43,626
I'm just saying that maybe the
collar shouldn't see the daylight.

962
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:45,092
Mmm.

963
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:46,193
Ah!

I'm Sara Lavrof.

No, no, no, no.
I can't do this.

or not?

a lot on your mind.

Yes?

Oh, sorry. But that was
just so beautiful.

You have to tell Sara
all that stuff.

01:15:39,963 --> 01:15:42,095
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1288
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:44,095
I don't wanna cry,
I don't wanna cry...

1289
01:15:44,097 --> 01:15:46,761
Ugh. I still have no fluids,
I can't cry.

1290
01:15:46,763 --> 01:15:48,797
TAXI DRIVER:
I don't want to see you cry.

1291
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,929
I waited for you at the Alhambra,
and you didn't show up.

1292
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:54,030
(STRUMS GUITAR)

1293
01:15:54,032 --> 01:15:55,695
You? How did you...

1294
01:15:55,697 --> 01:15:57,862
Your little friend
has guided me to you.

1295
01:15:57,864 --> 01:15:59,263
(SQUEAKING)

1296
01:15:59,265 --> 01:16:00,396
Ratty!

1297
01:16:00,398 --> 01:16:03,163
Oh! I'm happier than a
cockroach in a latrine!

1298
01:16:03,165 --> 01:16:06,262
How I like to see you smile,
my <i>palomita.</i>

1299
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:09,862
Uh, I'm starting to be worried
about the meaning of <i>"palomita."</i>

1300
01:16:09,864 --> 01:16:12,497
Ah! Who cares?
Let's start a real party!

1301
01:16:13,697 --> 01:16:15,964
Oh! She drives me crazy.

1302
01:16:17,265 --> 01:16:19,763
You're going
to miss him, too.

1303
01:16:19,765 --> 01:16:22,796
He's probably the most
annoying, irritating,

1304
01:16:22,798 --> 01:16:25,198
badly-dressed sidekick ever.

1305
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,762
But you're right,
I am gonna miss him.

1306
01:16:27,764 --> 01:16:29,198
I know this isn't the same,

1307
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,066
but maybe this
will cheer you up.

1308
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:35,498
Are you serious?

1309
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,730
Hmm.

1310
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:37,897
Yeah!

1311
01:16:37,899 --> 01:16:40,098
(HUMMING)

1312
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:43,630
(GOOFY LAUGH)

1313
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:47,898
Uh, sorry. You know, it's
something I do when I get, uh...

1314
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,632
You still want
to be my girlfriend?

1315
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:56,432
Come on!
Let's dance, everybody!

1316
01:16:56,434 --> 01:16:58,167
One, two, three!

1317
01:16:58,836 --> 01:17:01,036
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

1318
01:17:05,267 --> 01:17:06,499
(SQUEAKING)

1319
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:07,667
(WHINES, PANTING)

1320
01:17:11,036 --> 01:17:12,568
Hey, hey! Hey-ah!

1321
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,001
(CLAPPING RHYTHMICALLY)

1322
01:17:22,637 --> 01:17:24,603
(EXCLAIMING)
