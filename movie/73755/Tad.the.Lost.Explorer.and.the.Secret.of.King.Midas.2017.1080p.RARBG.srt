Panic leads to hysteria.

823
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:15,900
Hysteria leads
to desperation.

824
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,701
Any of them does not
lead to a solution.

825
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,034
Duh!

826
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:21,400
Is there anything actually
useful in that book?

827
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,768
Step three -- Think
outside the box.

828
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:26,501
I would if we could
get outside the box!

829
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:30,501
Wait, hey, I think
Jeff has found...

830
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:32,802
the way out.

831
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:37,969
The spiral symbolizes
the air...wind, that's it!

832
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,503
Come on, Jeff, focus!

833
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,369
Step one -- Stay calm!

834
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:42,635
That was step two.

835
00:47:42,635 --> 00:47:44,436
Okay, step two!

836
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:45,936
But you can't move
on to step two

837
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:47,503
without doing
step one first!

838
00:47:47,503 --> 00:47:49,769
And what was
step one?

839
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:53,436
I will look, but all this
excitement, I just...

840
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:55,670
So the tree is earth
and the river is water.

841
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,503
Earth, water,
wind, and fire!

842
00:47:57,503 --> 00:47:58,804
That's Mother Nature.

843
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:00,503
Step one, step one...

844
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,237
Forget it!

845
00:48:01,237 --> 00:48:03,371
Jeff, please,
we have no time!

846
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,438
(dog barking)

847
00:48:08,438 --> 00:48:09,637
Has the mutt
found the exit?

848
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:10,804
I hope so.

849
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:15,538
Way to go, Jeff!

850
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:18,838
Okay, step four -- If you
find the exit, use it!

851
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:20,306
Yes!

852
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:21,773
All the symbols
point to the jungle.

853
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,438
Odysseus are digging
in the desert.

854
00:48:23,438 --> 00:48:25,371
Now I know
where Paititi is.

855
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:26,505
I know it!

856
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:27,373
Come on, Sara,
let's get out of here!

857
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:40,940
(coughing)

858
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,507
Well done, Jeff!

859
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:45,940
You did it, buddy.

860
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,974
You're the best!

861
00:48:50,974 --> 00:48:54,074
Hey, Belzonie, you're
still in one piece!

862
00:48:56,074 --> 00:48:57,641
You love her, too,
don't you?

863
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:04,909
Okay, step five --
If escape is successful,

864
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,043
turn around
and go home.

865
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,409
BOTH:
What?

866
00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:09,043
Yeah, I've had
enough.

867
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:10,675
We can't go now.

868
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:12,641
Yeah, the golden
statue mustn't fall

869
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:15,576
into the hands
of Odysseus.

870
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:17,076
Well, if I could get a
big bonus for working

871
00:49:17,076 --> 00:49:20,077
in these terrible
conditions...

872
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:22,311
Is that a no?

873
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:23,909
We need to move fast
before Kopponen

874
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:27,376
realizes they're digging
in the wrong place.

875
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:29,376
Freddy, can you
drive an excavator?

876
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:32,577
35 dollars an hour plus
20 cents a mile, union rate.

877
00:49:32,577 --> 00:49:34,411
Forget him!
I'm an expert.

878
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:48,713
Hop on!

879
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:02,945
How'd you learn
to drive this thing?

880
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:05,945

Yeah, look Sara,

You worked in the
