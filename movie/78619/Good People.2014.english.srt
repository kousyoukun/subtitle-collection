1
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:37,178


2
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:43,178


3
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,178
(Jack) Where is he?

4
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,558


5
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,958


6
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,958
(Jack) He's a French dealer selling a case of liquid heroin.

7
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:39,298
Ben, grab the drugs. Bobby's at the money.

8
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,201
Me and Marshall will cover you till you get back to the car.

9
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,836
Then we get the fuck out.

10
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,238
So my plan, basically.

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,107
You came to me, remember?

12
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,115
That's him.

13
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:19,115


14
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,849
Bobby.

15
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,184
Sorry, mate.

16
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:46,449


17
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,036
(Jack) Bobby.

18
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,206
Bobby.

19
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,843
Fuck.

20
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,782
Bobby.

21
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,185
(Marshall) Jack. Bobby.

22
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,587
Bobby is gone, Jack. We need to leave now.

23
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,856
Come on. Come on, now.

24
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,032
Hi.

25
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,735
Hi, sweetie pie.

26
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,672
How's my beautiful godson?

27
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,207
Yes.

28
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,343
[Whispering] Come here.

29
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:14,279
Hi, sweet pie.

30
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,448
I missed you.

31
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,950
You're late. Now I'm going to be late.

32
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,852
Nice to see you, too.

33
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,122
Someone has been crying his little head off all morning.

34
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,891
The bloody washing machine's broken.

35
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,926
I'm having to wash everything in the sink.

36
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,129
Speaking of which-- don't push your luck, mommy.

37
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,734
Godmothers babysit, we buy presents, we don't do laundry.

38
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,003
Someone's very grumpy.

39
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,905
You got your period? No.

40
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,974
It's Sushi night, actually.

41
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,344
You're not still doing that, are you? Yeah.

42
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,346
You might as well wear a t-shirt saying,

43
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,981
"hi, I'm ovulating. Do you want to fuck?"

44
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:54,386
What's the romance in that? Darling, you do know, if I had the money, I'd--

45
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,022
well, actually, I'd first go buy a new washing machine,

46
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,258
but then after that I'd pay for you to go private.

47
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,427
I'd ivf you a baby.

48
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,666
How's tom?

49
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,335
He's just spending every waking minute at the house.

50
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,939
You're so lucky to have him.

51
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:17,075
And you're so lucky to have him.

52
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,913
(Mike) Tom. Tom.

53
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,483
You up there?

54
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,322
What you doing? Didn't you hear me?

55
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,326
Job I just finished had a little extra.

56
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,194
Thought you could use them.

57
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,732
You all right, mate?

58
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,468
I think we're going to lose the house. Oh, shit.

59
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,638
I thought you were coming along. Yeah.

60
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,841
Not far enough.

61
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,677
Pumped all the money into it.

62
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:56,281
Half my budget went into this fucking dry rot.

63
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,953
What does Anna say?

64
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,122
I haven't told her, yet.

65
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:08,427
She only knows half of what I spent and she's already freaking out.

66
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,897
We're trying to start a family. Can't even afford the rent on our apartment.

67
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,866
Just talk to her, mate. She'll understand.

68
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,904
Come on.

69
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,076
If you're up for it, a friend of mine needs some painting done next week.

70
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,512
Won't pay much, but--

71
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:31,516
yeah. Thanks.

72
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:35,554
It's a good thing I have a master's degree. Come in handy.

73
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,055
See you, bud.

74
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,070
Tom Wright? Yeah.

75
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,942
You're served.

76
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,314
We've got two weeks?

77
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,284
Thanks.

78
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,999
Ben.

79
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,301
Turn it down.

80
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,583
(Anna) Hello?

81
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,856
Hi.

82
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,391
Hi.

83
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,931
It's, uh, Sushi night?

84
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,733
You forgot.

85
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:57,102
No. No.

86
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:00,705
I never forget Sushi night. It's fine.

87
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,275
Nice wine.

88
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,944
It was just a few quid extra.

89
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:09,147
A very nice wine. And I thought it was worth it.

90
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,252
Of course it's worth it.

91
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,957
Come here.

92
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,191
Sushi night.

93
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,663
How's Julian?

94
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:28,567
He's...Loud and--

95
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,937
tonight, yeah?

96
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,772
Someone's going to get pregnant.

97
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,204
Hey.

98
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,175
You okay?

99
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,748
We're going to lose the house.

100
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,089
No.

101
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,227
No. We're going to work it out.

102
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,199
Mike just got me a few days on a good job.

103
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,604
Maybe it's time we go back. No.

104
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,974
No. Tom.

105
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,442
This was my idea.

106
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,181
I promised you a fresh start.

107
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:54,119
I promised you a place to start a family.

108
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,355
That was then.

109
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,794
I'm not giving up.

110
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,297
So...You can shut up.

111
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,134
[Laughs] Tonight is Sushi night.

112
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,903
I'm feeling lucky.

113
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,112
Ben.

114
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,560
Ben.

115
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,378
No answer.

116
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,550
Tom.

117
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,723
Ben?

118
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,161
I'm coming down.

119
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,171
Ben.

120
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,683
Ben?

121
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,318
Oh, tom.

122
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,729
Oh, my God.

123
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,703
I can't believe he was down here the whole time.

124
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,673
Yeah. Right below where our bedroom is.

125
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,633
Anna. What?

126
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,325
Oh, my God, tom.

127
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,494
220,000 pounds.

128
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:26,197
What the hell was Ben doing with this much cash?

129
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,734
What was he doing living in our basement with all this cash?

130
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,873
Well, he was on disability,

131
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,743
and maybe he had a big settlement after an accident?

132
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:42,714
I just don't know why it wouldn't be in the bank.

133
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,341
So, what do we do?

134
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,480
Hm?

135
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,318
We call the police. Yeah?

136
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,164
Anna. Anna. What?

137
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,233
Wait. [Doorbell rings]

138
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,734
Tom.

139
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,706
Help me. We shouldn't have brought this up here.

140
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,541
I know. You want to help me?

141
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,909
Tom. Help me now.

142
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,815
I got it. Answer the door.

143
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,856
Mr. Wright? Yes.

144
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:02,627
I'm detective inspector John halden.

145
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,566
So, Mr. Wright, what-what is it you do?

146
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,936
He's a landscape architect. Oh.

147
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:16,374
Yeah. I used to be, in Chicago.

148
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,644
I had a small business, a little crew,

149
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,646
but it fell apart in the crash,

150
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,049
so we moved here for a fresh start.

151
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:29,687
We also had an unfortunate miscarriage a few years ago, so--

152
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,956
oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry.

153
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,459
It was a nice change for us.

154
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,495
So, now I-I do contracting work

155
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,198
odd jobs and manual labor.

156
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,633
Why London? Tom's renovating a house.

157
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,803
My grandmother passed a few years ago

158
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:50,375
and we inherited the family house, so I thought I'd fix it up.

159
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:54,212
Good for you.

160
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,648
So, Mrs. Wright, how are you, um, how are you liking London?

161
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,751
Anna, please.

162
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:03,421
I'm a school teacher at morningside primary school.

163
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,324
My wife runs a clinic just down the street from there.

164
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:10,194
Sterling house? That's a, uh, women's shelter, right?

165
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:14,365
Yeah. They look after young women with drug addiction, take them off the streets.

166
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,168
The government has withdrawn its funding, but they're hanging in there.

167
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,405
My wife, Marie, isn't one for giving up.

168
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,745
Anyhow...

169
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,914
So, thank you for the tea.

170
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,519
It was very good.

171
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,157
How long have you been renting the room downstairs?

172
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,526
Uh, not long.

173
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,763
I mean, we just did it 'cause we needed help with the rent.

174
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,765
Three months, maybe. Yeah.

175
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:52,036
And he always paid by cash. Did you find this odd?

176
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,973
No, not really, no.

177
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,809
Did he, um,

178
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,278
did he have any visitors?

179
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:09,387
Uh, he really kept to himself. I mean, he didn't have much.

180
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,789
No. He watched a lot of television.

181
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,459
Yeah, that's true. Very loud.

182
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,629
Did, um, did you find anything unusual about him?

183
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,504
When you, um,

184
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,507
when you discovered the body, did you--

185
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,676
did you find anything else?

186
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,482
Um-- no.

187
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,852
The reason I ask is because the initial police report

188
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,521
suggests that he died of a drug overdose,

189
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,923
and the team downstairs are just looking for evidence

190
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,092
that he may have kept drugs there.

191
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,729
No, we had-- I mean, we had no idea.

192
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,735
Well, it's just, uh-- it's just routine.

193
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,670
For your own safety.

194
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,789
[Newscaster] ...Late 40's

195
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,125
discovered in the basement of a flat.

196
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,628
The cause of death is as yet unknown.

197
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,964


198
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,001
To the city now, and London's markets are still not steady.

199
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,310
There's a new lead

200
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,847
to-to the guys that gave Julie the drugs.

201
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,784
I thought Martin took you off that case.

202
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,319
Yeah.

203
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,257
Is it dangerous?

204
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,296
Really dangerous, then.

205
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,633
Still not going to bring her back, John.

206
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,369
So,

207
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,871
why take the risk?

208
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,677
It might save someone else's daughter.

209
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,017
We'll call halden in the morning.

210
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,230
Tom?

211
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,234
Tom?

212
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,094
What are you doing?

213
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,174
We spent our whole lives being good, right?

214
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:55,012
And what has it gotten us? Nothing.

215
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:59,450
So, maybe this money is a gift to help us get our lives back on track.

216
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,319
Tom.

217
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,790
We don't know where this money comes from.

218
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:12,663
This could be really, really bad money.

219
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,865
I know.

220
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,001
I know.

221
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,271
But what makes money bad?

222
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:23,941
Not the money. The people make it bad.

223
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,277
What people do with it.

224
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,547
Now, I'm not saying we do anything rash.

225
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,452
All I'm saying is we just wait and see.

226
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,355
He's been dead a week.

227
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,491
The cops came, they didn't find anything.

228
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,160
No one's come forward looking for the money.

229
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,563
Okay? And if they do,

230
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,433
this will look like Ben hid it.

231
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,605
I say we just hide it

232
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,375
and wait a week.

233
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,355
Two weeks.

234
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,959
All right.

235
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:21,832
End of the month. And then

236
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,002
nobody comes,

237
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,106
we just find it again.

238
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,425
Halden, where are the background checks on the Scott case?

239
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:54,231
You wouldn't be wasting time on the Witkowski case? I told you to drop it.

240
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,501
Nobody gives a shit if Jack Witkowski killed his twat of a brother.

241
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:01,539
Another deficient shitsack off the street is fine with this department.

242
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:05,276
The Scott background checks, on my desk by five.

243
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:25,229
And this has nothing to do with Julie?

244
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,431
No, no, no, no. It's just--

245
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,201
it's just a hunch I want to follow up on.

246
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,973
If I'm going to break every law I'm here to uphold,

247
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,575
I'd rather it was for a good cause.

248
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,313
Okay.

249
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,351
It has everything to do with my daughter.

250
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,826
Bank accounts, inland revenue, utility bills, mortgage.

251
00:24:55,828 --> 00:25:00,431
From now on, if Thomas or Anna Wright sneeze, you'll know about it.

252
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,669
But I warn you, there's not much money to follow.

253
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,972
No, not at the moment.

254
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,308
Okay.

255
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,478
You'll keep me posted?

256
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,014
If Martin finds out, I'll be fired.

257
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,050
Martin's a smug little prick.

258
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,521
Superintendent tosspot can go fuck himself.

259
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,842
(Tom) Detective halden? Yes.

260
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:47,511
Hi, this is tom Wright from the--

261
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:50,414
how are you? We were just wondering

262
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:54,985
if you heard anything about the next of kin for Ben tuttle.

263
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,655
No, no, no. We haven't located any living relatives.

264
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,358
I just ask because, uh,

265
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,496
we wanted to know what do with his things, his clothes and stuff.

266
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,264
No, no one's come forward, yet.

267
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,569
Okay.

268
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:15,539
And, uh, do you know, was it officially--

269
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,374
yeah, overdose.

270
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,543
Looks like it was liquid o.

271
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,279
What's liquid o? Heroin.

272
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,549
I see. Wow.

273
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,185
Okay. Have a good day. Bye.

274
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,135
(Jack) You met my little brother, haven't you?

275
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,071
Always tried to let him win.

276
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,874
Any game.

277
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,776
Drove mom crazy.

278
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:28,112
Said Bobby would never learn if we did that.

279
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,449
'Course she was right.

280
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,554
Jack and Bobby. How it came to this?

281
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,557
Mom was a fan.

282
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,527
She also had high expectations.

283
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,366
Where's cousin Ben?

284
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:58,375
You know, when you recommend a guy,

285
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,679
you're tying his name to yours.

286
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,515
Did you know he was going to fuck me?

287
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,819
If you tell me where I find him,

288
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,890
maybe I'll choose to believe you on that.

289
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:20,130
Eddie, sir, could I please trouble you for a pen?

290
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,284
You done the right thing.

291
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,123
But that doesn't mean I'm not going to hold you accountable.

292
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,904
Anna. Yeah.

293
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,474
I spent some of the money.

294
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,681
What?

295
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,184
The day we found Ben,

296
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:51,088
the landlord gave us an eviction notice.

297
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,690
I was going to tell you, but you were in such a good mood,

298
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,727
and it was Sushi night.

299
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:59,563
And then we found the money, and--

300
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,466
I took just enough to keep the roof over our heads.

301
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:08,739
Look, we're in this.

302
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:12,242
As soon as we put the money in the oven and we didn't take it out, we were in this.

303
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,915
If we don't start paying off the mortgage, we're going to lose the house.

304
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,688
How do we do this?

305
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,424
We spend just enough to stop the bleeding.

306
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,827
We use cash where we can,

307
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,629
and we get Mike to write an invoice.

308
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,832
You want to bring Mike into this?

309
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,035
No, it's not like that. We're not bringing him into it.

310
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:42,105
But when I do a job for him, he usually pays me cash,

311
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,941
and then writes an invoice.

312
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:46,610
So, if anyone asks--

313
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,680
right, there's a paper trail.

314
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,683
What if someone comes looking for it, tom?

315
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,322
Anna.

316
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,593
Nobody's come.

317
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:04,828
Nobody's going to come.

318
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,830
And if they do,

319
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,499
who's to say Ben didn't spend it?

320
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:12,836
How much are we talking?

321
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,439
Just enough to stay above water.

322
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,141
The mortgage, credit cards.

323
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,577
Just so we're in the clear.

324
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,893
There's only one problem that I can think of.

325
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:40,697
What? You are going to be really lonely

326
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,400
when the debt collectors stop calling.

327
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,517
Hi, this is Anna Wright. I'm calling to inquire about an appointment.

328
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:07,491
Yeah, for an ivf consultation, if possible.

329
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,632
Hello.

330
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,158
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

331
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,394
[Cell phone ringing]

332
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,302
Halden. It's Duncan.

333
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,805
Yeah, what's up? Not much.

334
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,241
I'm calling 'cause we got a flag.

335
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,110
The Americans? Yeah.

336
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:03,013
You were right. A lot of activity today.

337
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:05,749
Mr. Wright made five separate payments.

338
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,752
I've got deposits to the current account, mortgage and credit cards.

339
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:11,555
Cash? Some cash. Some money transfers.

340
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:15,692
He spread it out. No single payment big enough to raise flags at the bank.

341
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,168
Fuck.

342
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,346
We found the liquid o.

343
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,616
What about the cash?

344
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,286
(Halden) Mr. Wright?

345
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,459
Detective.

346
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:06,429
It looks like someone came for Ben's stuff after all.

347
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,964
Yeah.

348
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,800
Who do you think would do this?

349
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,070
Your tenant crossed a very bad man.

350
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:17,274
That man's name is Jack Witkowski.

351
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,646
So, who called the police?

352
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,014
No one.

353
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,817
I just wanted to talk to you.

354
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:31,821
Yeah, well, why?

355
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,024
Let's go upstairs.

356
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,795
I'm sorry.

357
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:41,131
It's not back there. It's in my car.

358
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:45,769
But I-I-I did just get an invoice from, um, Mike Calloway.

359
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,939
This Mike Calloway, he's a friend of yours?

360
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,675
He is, but I do a lot of work with him,

361
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:55,345
and he owed me on two jobs,

362
00:36:55,347 --> 00:37:00,050
and we got paid upfront for this other thing last week.

363
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,686
If you're holding anything back,

364
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,854
you better tell me.

365
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,090
I don't quite understand.

366
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,293
The dead tenant, Ben tuttle, drug abuse,

367
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,128
sudden activity in your bank account,

368
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,298
and now, coincidentally, a break-in.

369
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,501
I don't want to accuse you of anything.

370
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,971
I just want to clarify things.

371
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,373
(Anna) You're welcome.

372
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,177
Hey.

373
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,013
Hey. Ouch.

374
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,816
[Whispering] Sorry, I have to take this.

375
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,357
Would you do me a favor and please don't mention the break-in to my wife?

376
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,361
She's been a little rattled since Ben died.

377
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:46,429
No, really, it's fine.

378
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,865
Tom finally got paid on that big job I was telling you about.

379
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:52,068
Oh, my God. I can't believe that.

380
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,170
Oh, no, that's too much.

381
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,706
Sarah, I got to go. Okay, bye.

382
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:02,846
So, this Mike Calloway, he pays you in cash?

383
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:06,683
Sorry, what are you implying?

384
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,119
I'm implying nothing.

385
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,355
I was inquiring about the deposit, and your husband cleared it up.

386
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:15,258
So, all's good.

387
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,307
The worst part is behind us, right, baby?

388
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,114
Yeah.

389
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,318
It's all good.

390
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,022
Yo. Hey.

391
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,157
Bloody hell. What?

392
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,495
Quality stuff. Yeah.

393
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:28,565
I thought you said you were going to lose your house.

394
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,902
Mike. Yeah.

395
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:36,039
Can I tell you something?

396
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,809
Hang on.

397
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,483


398
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,086
Sure. What kind of job?

399
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,957
Okay, I'm interested.

400
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,362
Yeah, I'll come by with my partner.

401
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,434
Fine, I'll come alone.

402
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,136
Okay. See you then.

403
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,409
Looks like we might have another job.

404
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:16,479
(Tom) French guy, bought a big house in notting hill.

405
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,532
Mr. Wright. Hi.

406
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,867
Please take a seat. Thanks.

407
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:41,438
You can call me tom. You're mister--

408
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,340
you must forgive me. English is not my first language.

409
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,075
Okay.

410
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,844
And you, you're American, yes? I am.

411
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:52,849
I live here now. And you, you just moved to the area?

412
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:56,019
I'm expanding my empire.

413
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:02,692
Tell me, Mr. Wright, are you a team player?

414
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:05,261
I-I guess.

415
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:13,102
Do you want to talk about the renovations, mister...

416
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,038
Genghis Khan.

417
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,242
Genghis Khan? Is that what you said?

418
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:20,844
Do you know this man?

419
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:24,113
Uh, genghis Khan, yeah.

420
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,915
I mean, I've heard of him--

421
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,551
he marched all over the world.

422
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,954
Countries were so afraid of this man,

423
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:35,058
they would lay down their arms when they heard of his approach.

424
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,327
Do you know what happened when they did that?

425
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,999
No, I don't know. Nothing.

426
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,268
Nothing happened.

427
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:50,773
The great Khan welcomed them into his kingdom with open arms.

428
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,510
But those that resisted,

429
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,246
felt his full fury.

430
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:59,482
He burned the cities, killed the men,

431
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:03,052
raped their women, salted their crops.

432
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,359
Okay.

433
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,128
Um--

434
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,564
I'm sorry, I--

435
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,799
I think I'm probably not the right guy for this,

436
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,036
so maybe you should get someone else for the renovations, okay?

437
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,573
Recently, a group of men stole from me.

438
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:26,943
Where I come from, this would not happen.

439
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:30,146
But I'm new here, so--

440
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,817
it's not the product that matters,

441
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,387
it's a question of honor.

442
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,523
So now I'm burning cities,

443
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:42,759
I'm salting crops.

444
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,428
And you have housed my enemy.

445
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,732
Ben tuttle.

446
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,635
Oh, I see.

447
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:56,105
Okay, yes-- have you heard of Jack Witkowski?

448
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,510
This man dishonored me.

449
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:05,415
So, here's my question for you and your lovely wife, Anna.

450
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:11,020
Are you team players?

451
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:14,257
What do you mean? Whose team are you on?

452
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,760
I'm not on anybody's team.

453
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,229
If you're not on anybody's team,

454
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:23,333
you are not on my team.

455
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:27,437
So, whose team are you on?

456
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,743
Detective halden, it's tom Wright.

457
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:35,144
I need your help.

458
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,548
Babe, it's me. Can you give me--

459
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,722
where's my money?

460
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,060
Where's my money?

461
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,363
I don't know what you're talking about.

462
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,537
Me and my brother's money.

463
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,740
Are you an idiot, you fucking cunt?

464
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,844
And he died getting it.

465
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,115
So, you can understand me wanting it back.

466
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,318
Now, where is it?

467
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,253
[Whispering] I don't know.

468
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,190
Please.

469
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,298
Please.

470
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,634
Where's the money?

471
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,899
So, that's how you want to play.

472
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,668
It's fine with me.

473
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,300
[Echoing] I didn't want to go this far.

474
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,406
Please...

475
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,842
Please, stop. Please.

476
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,577
Where's my money?

477
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,979
Please. Where's is it?

478
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:51,614
Please stop.

479
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,322
Where's my money?

480
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,462
Fuck!

481
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,435
Hm.

482
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:32,488
Anna.

483
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,293
Anna, no.

484
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,128
Welcome home, Mrs. Tommy.

485
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,997
Tom.

486
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,733
[Whispering] The police are coming. Just stall.

487
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,769
I'm okay.

488
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,439
Oh, my God.

489
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,608
That's enough.

490
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,214
Get up.

491
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,749
Up!

492
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,966
This is what Tommy has.

493
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,405
Didn't you know? When you find a pot of gold,

494
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:26,075
there's always a monster guarding it.

495
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:27,910
You smell so nice.

496
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,217
Just relax.

497
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,819
Stop. It's downstairs.

498
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:40,456
Bullshit. I looked all over.

499
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,792
It's in the window frame.

500
00:47:42,794 --> 00:47:45,828
I hid it in the window frame.

501
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,461
Tom's lying.

502
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,874
He's afraid that if he gives you the money, you're going to kill us.

503
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,362
Fuck.

504
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,034
Where's the fucking money?

505
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,905
Promise me you won't kill us.

506
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,077
No.

507
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,215
One, two...
1¡A2 ...

508
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:17,320
Stop pissing about.

509
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:19,455
Which one?

510
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:23,092
Three, four, five.
3¡A4¡A5¡C

511
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:27,930
This one.

512
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,398
It's this one.

513
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,373
Oh, fuck!

514
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:40,509
(Tom) We're in here.

515
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,211
Downstairs. He's downstairs .

516
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,470
(Halden) You're in serious trouble, Mr. and Mrs. Wright.

517
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:10,840
You stole some money and you spent it,

518
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,677
so you're going to prison.

519
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,382
Do we need to get a lawyer?

520
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,484
A lawyer won't change that.

521
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:25,221
Turning it in won't change it unless you can turn all of it in.

522
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,191
No, I didn't think so.

523
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:33,129
And Jack Witkowski isn't the kind of guy to forgive and forget.

524
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:36,365
He'd find a way to get to you before we could even bring you to trial.

525
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,568
I've tried to arrest him for two years.

526
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,705
He's got ties to the police.

527
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,708
Someone who turns a blind eye to what he does.

528
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,710
There are some people in Scotland yard that think

529
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:50,646
that Jack is doing us a service.

530
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,282
He kills his fair share of bad people.

531
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:56,552
They believe that one in the hand is worth five in the street.

532
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,255
Think they can...Control him.

533
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:04,293
(Anna) But you don't.

534
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,829
After he's paid off

535
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:10,599
whichever fucking corrupt coppers are protecting him,

536
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,869
he sells his stuff on the street at cut price.

537
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:16,639
He targets young women,

538
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,774
single mums,

539
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,278
people he thinks he can control.

540
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,749
That's his specialty.

541
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,756


542
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:40,029
What? You help me, I'll help you.

543
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:46,068
When Jack comes after you, we set a trap.

544
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,205
How? You say he took your phone.

545
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,740
Yeah. When he calls,

546
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:54,777
you agree to take the money to him.

547
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,980
You want to use us as bait?

548
00:51:57,982 --> 00:51:59,648
No.

549
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,351
All right, wait-- no.

550
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:07,156
Just-- if we-if we do it, that means we walk. This doesn't go in the books.

551
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,725
If I took this to headquarters, Jack would get wind of it,

552
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:12,261
I'd be out of a job, you two would be dead.

553
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,267
Find somewhere safe for tonight.

554
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,736
(Anna) Tom.

555
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:57,039
Tom.

556
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,475
You know he would've killed you, right?

557
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:03,646
You told me to stall. You told me the police were coming.

558
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,481
Before.

559
00:53:05,483 --> 00:53:08,184
Why didn't you just show him where the money was?

560
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,686
Why didn't you tell me somebody broke into our house.

561
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,323
I just wanted us to have a little money so we wouldn't get evicted,

562
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:16,525
so we could have-- [Pounding on wall] Shut up!

563
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,394
So we could have a life.

564
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:37,279
I went to the fertility clinic,

565
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:40,783
and I spent some of the money.

566
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,286
I'm sorry.

567
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:46,288
I feel so stupid.

568
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,026
It's okay.

569
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:53,696
Something was wrong with me.

570
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:55,531
I just--

571
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,333
it's okay.

572
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:01,770
Come here. Come here.

573
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,243
All we wanted was a family.

574
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,186
(Tom) It's him.

575
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,059
Hello?

576
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:25,995
(Jack) Knock, knock. Room service.

577
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:32,101
So, where have you put it? In the hotel safe or under the bed?

578
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:35,938
How can you fuck on that dirty mattress?

579
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,709
People like you are so predictable, Tommy.

580
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:46,348
All right, you can have your money. Just leave us alone.

581
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,618
I want to see you and the money.

582
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,353
When? Where?

583
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,489
It needs to be in public for my safety.

584
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:57,126
Tomorrow, noon, Victoria park by the pond.

585
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,794
And then you leave us alone.

586
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,033
What now?

587
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:14,176
The, um, the tracking device is sewn into the seam.

588
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:18,247
It's virtually undetectable, and I can track you on my phone.

589
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:21,550
As soon as you see him, put the bag down and walk away.

590
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,285
Don't run, don't look back.

591
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:25,521
No exceptions, no heroics, no nothing.

592
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:27,289
Just drop and go.

593
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:31,360
And when we're gone, you'll arrest him?

594
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,262
Yes, as soon as he picks up the bag, it's over,

595
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:35,264
by which time you'll be gone and safe.

596
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:37,966
You'll be under constant supervision.

597
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,636
My men will be watching you, but you won't see them.

598
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:42,471
All right.

599
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,206
Drop and go.

600
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,811
Okay.

601
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:58,554
(Anna) He's going to get us killed.

602
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,823
(Tom) Not if we have back-up.

603
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,502
Bonjour. Enchantee.

604
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,372
You must be Anna.

605
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:20,843
I take it Jack Witkowski paid you a visit.

606
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:22,678
Yeah.

607
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,280
So, tell me, Mr. and Mrs. Wright,

608
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:28,584
what is the plan you want to speak to me about?

609
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,902
Where is he?

610
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,004
He'll call us.

611
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:54,803
Where are you? You're late.

612
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:59,208
Tell me, Tommy, why are our good friends from the met joining us?

613
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,510
Don't worry about him. He's not with us.

614
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:04,112
Just let him walk by and you can have your money.

615
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,982
I'm not talking about that one, you tosser. He works for me.

616
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,585
Wave to the good people, Marshall.

617
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:12,187
I'm talking about that mangy fuck, halden.

618
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,493
Run. Drop the bag.

619
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,531
Fuck.

620
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,633
Marshall, you fucking dick, get the fucking money.

621
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,776
Drop the bag, tom.

622
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:38,247
Drop the bag.

623
00:58:38,249 --> 00:58:40,249
Drop the bag. Run.

624
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,085
Anna, run.

625
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,967
(Anna) Why didn't you just drop the money?

626
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:02,204
'Cause the money's the only thing keeping us alive right now.

627
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,443
Halden is dead.

628
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:10,178
I know.

629
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,748
They killed him. I know.

630
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,251
Anna.

631
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,502
What are we going to do, tom?

632
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,439
Where are we going to go?

633
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,409
We have one place where we can go.

634
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,778
At least for a few hours.

635
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,553
(Khan) You broke your word.

636
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:53,555
Do you think I would let you play me?

637
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:55,090
(Tom) I'm not trying to play you, Khan.

638
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,059
When I find you,

639
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,795
just remember you brought this on yourselves.

640
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:20,215
Would you mind giving us a minute in private, Mrs. halden?

641
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,758
Yeah, I was going to grab a coffee anyway.

642
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,464
What in God's name were you thinking?

643
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:38,333
Not only were you wearing a bulletproof vest,

644
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,535
but you took a firearm into a public park.

645
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:43,171
There are children there, for Christ's sake.

646
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,509
You're an embarrassment.

647
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,112
You should've retired when your junkie daughter died.

648
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,484
[Nurse] Excuse me, sir. Mr. halden needs to rest.

649
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,986
Okay, my apologies.

650
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,056
You rest up, John.

651
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,058
Good news for me is

652
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,926
now I don't have to pay your pension.

653
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,529
Who's going to pay your pension, ray?

654
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:11,333
Scotland yard or guys like Jack Witkowski?

655
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:52,174
I wanted to fix the floor before I showed it to you.

656
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:00,582
It's a little different upstairs. You want to see?

657
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,518
Yeah.

658
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,691
Remember when we started working on the house

659
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:12,728
and we'd eat take-away on the floor?

660
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,331
Yeah.

661
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:23,872
Remember when I thought I'd be done in four months?

662
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:27,209
Remember when I thought I'd be pregnant in six?

663
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,685
I'm sorry I stopped coming here.

664
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,624
I'm sorry I got lost in this place.

665
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,495
I never needed the house, tom.

666
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,599
All I needed was us.

667
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,636
I know.

668
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,271
(Anna) We're going to make it.

669
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,341
Tell me we're going to make it.

670
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,664
It's okay, boo-boo. I'm coming.

671
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,634
Give me your phone.

672
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:01,970
Give me your phone.

673
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:17,919
Sarah?

674
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:20,856
(Jack) You smell so lovely.

675
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,195
Julian's a real peach.

676
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,598
Hello?

677
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,466
You want kids, don't you, Tommy?

678
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,102
Me, too.

679
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,771
Such a precious gift.

680
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:39,608
So, hurting little Julian

681
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,879
it's not going to be easy for me.

682
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,015
He's so smooth.

683
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,988
What's your plan, Tommy?

684
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:56,691
What's your plan, Tommy?

685
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:06,868
We can't go out. After the park, the police are looking for us, too.

686
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:17,379
We're hiding out in an old house in west London.

687
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,347
I'll text you the address

688
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,984
and you come meet us here.

689
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,754
Okay?

690
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,391
No more tricks.

691
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,630
Keep fucking quiet.

692
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,054
Better text Khan.

693
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,824
Yeah.

694
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,095
You really think he's going to come?

695
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:09,798
Yeah.

696
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,534
It's all about honor with that guy.

697
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,706
Sent.

698
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,645
You know they're going to have guns, right?

699
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,185
Guns are for pussies.

700
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,597
Yeah.

701
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,499
(Jack) Look who's come for dinner.

702
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,136
Anna?

703
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,773
Get ready.

704
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:33,248
This is the perfect place.

705
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,016
For what?

706
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,804
I see no cash.

707
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:59,340
It's in the house. Safe.

708
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,109
Don't fuck with me.

709
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:03,311
Jack, you can have the money

710
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:06,681
just as soon as we get Sarah and Julian.

711
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,660
Where's Mrs. Tommy?

712
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:21,930
She's inside, with the money.

713
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,048
What the fuck.

714
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,650
Honey, I'm home.

715
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,226
Mrs. Tommy.

716
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:59,000
You got five seconds to show me the money or I'm shooting your husband.

717
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:01,503
(Anna) The money's up here.

718
01:09:01,505 --> 01:09:03,738
How can I be sure?

719
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:12,280
I just want Sarah, I want Julian,

720
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:15,150
but if you hurt them or my husband,

721
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:17,852
I will destroy all of it.

722
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:21,089
That's impressive. I'll get them over.

723
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:33,835
Get the fuck out, love.

724
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,041
Now it's your turn.

725
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:02,497
Well done, sweetheart.

726
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:04,165
Now the bag.

727
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,185
Jack?

728
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,433
Are you all right?

729
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,309
Sarah!

730
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,915
(Anna) Sarah!

731
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:09,764
Go out the ladder.

732
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,233
[Whispering] Sarah, go out the ladder.

733
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,443
Oh, God. Give me Julian. Give me Julian

734
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:01,255
Andre?

735
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,660
(Khan) You betrayed me, Mr. Wright.

736
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,964
You cannot undo that.

737
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:52,867
You must be sacrificed pour le bien de tous.

738
01:17:58,808 --> 01:18:00,675
The greater good.

739
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:27,735
Does not seem fair.

740
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:31,706
You are playing with toys while I am not playing at all.

741
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,310
You are a worthy adversary.

742
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,354
Ahh!

743
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:28,829
Anna.

744
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,234
Anna.

745
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:44,779
Anna.

746

[Lady newscaster] Metro police today announced a breakthrough

747
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:29,824
in a case that's traumatized people living in the sleepy London suburb of mortlake.

748
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:34,328
It comes just 36 hours after a shootout which left five people dead

749
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:39,667
a house burnt to the ground, and the entire community in shock.

750
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:41,735
With me is superintendent ray Martin,

751
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:43,537
one of the officers in charge of the case.

752
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:45,840
Superintendent, what can you tell us?

753
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:48,175
We can now confirm that these tragic events

754
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,078
are directly linked to a drug turf war

755
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:55,716
which began with an armed robbery that turned deadly in an east end night club .

756
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:58,419
(Halden) Remarkable. Hi.

757
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:03,424
...and extraordinary bravery of veteran detective John halden

758
01:21:03,426 --> 01:21:06,861
a man I consider to be a personal friend and a colleague.

759
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:09,964
It's easy to be a hero when you're writing your own story.

760
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:16,737
Uh, the firemen found this.

761
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:17,938
It's, um--

762
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,843
it's not much, but, uh, it's yours.

763
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,421
Good luck.

764
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:44,031
Hm.

765
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,211
(Tom) What took you so long?

766
01:21:57,213 --> 01:21:59,513
I just had to do one last thing.

767
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,483
All right. Say goodbye to this hell hole.

768
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:06,854
Come on.

769
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:22,002
So, no more Sushi nights.
