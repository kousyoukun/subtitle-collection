1
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,588
Well, well,
Boris the Animal has a visitor.

2
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,056
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

3
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,561
It's a cake.

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,828
I decide what it is.

5
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,935
Looks like some kind of cake.

6
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,841
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know....

7
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,613
Oh, God.

8
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,427
Boris the Animal...

9
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,462
...you've got a visitor.

10
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,995
It's just Boris.

11
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,841
Your letters have been
a soul-nourishing...

12
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,772
...tonic.

13
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,639
And you are much more...

14
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,344
...unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

15
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,127
This ain't a conjugal visit.

16
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,664
So quit your conjugating.

17
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,132
When's the last time
you conjugated anything?

18
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,631
I see you've brought me a treat,
darling.

19
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,937
Would you mind cutting this up
for us? It's a special day.

20
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,742
I'm a romantic like that.

21
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,486
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

22
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,313
Why's that?

23
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,217
It'll ruin your figure.

24
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,533
You complete me.

25
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,414
The big one.

26
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,720
Boris! You promised
to take me with you!

27
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,955
We had a deal!

28
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,325
Obadiah Price.

29
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,132
Yes. I did make you a promise.

30
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,446
Wait. I smell something.

31
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,190
You can't win, Boris.

32
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,155
Let's agree to disagree.

33
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,261
There's too many of us.

34
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,161
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?

35
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,085
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.

36
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,375
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

37
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,036
Good afternoon.

38
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,900
Please give your attention
to my associate, Agent J.

39
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,701
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-biomechanical...

40
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,504
...neural-transmitting,
zero-synapse repositioner.

41
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,873
We call it the neuralyzer.

42
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,345
-Keep it simple, slick.
-Thanks a lot.

43
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,607
Thank you, Agent K.

44
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,082
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look right here.

45
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,820
You know how you're on a plane and
you're asked to turn your phone off?

46
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:37,224
You're like, "l ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane."

47
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,797
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.

48
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,197
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites and:

49
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,768
Just turn your damn phone off.

50
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,236
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff
tonight because your GPS don't work.

51
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,442
Check the composition
of the fuel units and surface deposits.

52
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,977
I wanna know who was driving.

53
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,579
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,943
-What are you gonna say tonight?
-Don't worry.

55
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,948
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.

56
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,815
-I'm hungry. You hungry?
-K.

57
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,651
Seriously,
I'm not even sure that's meat.

58
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,158
I think I just saw a tooth in that thing.
Or a claw. Or a hoof.

59
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,818
Thanks, Manny.

60
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,488
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket.

61
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,894
What would go good with this
would be silence.

62
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,228
See, here's the problem.

63
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,563
You can't smell it...

64
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,798
...because your nose already
smells like that, but my nose doesn't.

65
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:26,001
Silence goes good with a lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?

66
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,840
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.

67
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,414
Let me enjoy this.

68
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,175
Whoa, enjoyment.

69
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,752
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

70
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,117
I keep emotion out of it.

71
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,785
Out of what, K? Life?

72
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,595
You don't wanna run it by me?

73
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,698
-Let me know what you'll say?
-Don't worry.

74
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,300
Oh, no, I'm worried. Very worried.

75
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,869
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.

76
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,605
That thing people do when they
change their facial expression?

77
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,841
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.

78
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,946
And I have written
a hell of a speech for him.

79
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,513
People will be moved.

80
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,502
And now a few words from Agent K.

81
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,906
I worked with Zed for over 40 years,
and in all that time...

82
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,703
...he never invited me to dinner.

83
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,639
He never asked me to his house
to watch a game.

84
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,883
He never shared a single detail
of his personal life.

85
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,315
Yeah, he was weird.

86
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,724
Thank you.

87
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,927
And now we will hear from
our new chief, Agent O.

88
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,398
Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.

89
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,697
-That was your eulogy?
-He was a good man.

90
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,000
Ladies, gentlemen, other life forms.

91
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,175
When I told the Finucian Zyglot
about Zed's passing...

92
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,576
...she said something
that I'm going to repeat.

93
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,811
And I'm paraphrasing.

94
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,432
That's just so Zed.

95
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,634
Thank you.

96
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,318
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

97
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,087
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll
do better than that at my funeral?

98
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,288
You know, something like:

99
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,330
"J was a friend.

100
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,492
Now there's a big part of me
that's gone.

101
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,003
Oh, J, all the things
that I should have said...

102
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,438
...except I was too old...

103
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,407
...and craggy and surly...

104
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,842
...and just tight. I was too...

105
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,572
...tight.

106
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,651
I'm gonna just miss
your caramel-brown skin."

107
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,515
I'll wing something.

108
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,624
K, it's O. We have reports
of several humans suffering from...

109
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,524
...intestinal worms of alien origin.

110
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,755
Thank you, O.

111
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,096
How did you get to be like you?

112
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,031
Something happened, K.
What happened?

113
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,301
You know how I live
such a happy life?

114
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,331
How you live such a happy life?

115
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,442
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.

116
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,179
That's deep.

117
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,723
Jeffrey.

118
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,327
Do I know you?

119
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:10,000
Your services are legendary.
So says your father, Obadiah.

120
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,833
You were in Lunar-Max.

121
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,565
There is no prison that can hold me.

122
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,143
Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?

123
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,573
The device.

124
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:25,349
I'm going back in time to kill a man
before he takes my arm.

125
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,766
K, J!

126
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,529
So happy to see you.
Mr. Wu get you your regular table?

127
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,104
You no hungry?

128
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,373
Show us the tanks, Wu.

129
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,775
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.

130
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,714
Show us the tanks in the back.

131
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,189
So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?

132
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,621
Save the chop-socky bullshit
for the tourists, Wu.

133
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,391
Hey, what you guys
wanna bust my balls for, huh?

134
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,094
You don't have no balls.

135
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,305
Man, you look like
you come from the planet...

136
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,565
...Damn.

137
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,605
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32:

138
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,146
Selling unlicensed extraterrestrial...

139
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,744
...foodstuffs.

140
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,318
That is an Earth fish.

141
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,985
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me...

142
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,215
...that's a hate crime!

143
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,380
It would be...

144
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,117
...if you were Chinese.

145
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,725
K, come on. I got larvae to feed.

146
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,065
Who is the Spiky Bulba for?

147
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,132
Nobody.

148
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,290
Who's it for?

149
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,458
I keep them in case!

150
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,002
-ln case what?
-I don't know!

151
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,104
Anybody!

152
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,570
All right, you slug.

153
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,641
Wu...

154
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,407
...he and I are having issues right now,
but you shouldn't suffer for that.

155
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,276
Thank you, J.

156
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,578
So if you don't like getting
fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.

157
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,347
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.

158
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,957
On behalf of my pathetic self
and worthless children, you stay.

159
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,653
Allow me most honorable benefit
of serving you favorite noodles, K?

160
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,695
Don't nobody want your
nasty-ass noodles.

161
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,594
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

162
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,934
Shrimp and bok choy.

163
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,636
We're gonna be here for a while.

164
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,109
That was just mean.

165
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,680
What you did to Wu back there.

166
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,685
Snatched his skirt off.

167
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,851
That's just disrespectful.

168
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,857
I used to play a game
with my dad:

169
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,727
What'll You Have
For Your Last Meal.

170
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,367
You could do worse than this.

171
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,865
Okay.

172
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,807
I played a game with my dad...

173
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,000
...called catch.

174
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,668
Except I'd throw the ball
and it'd just hit the wall...

175
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,178
...because he wasn't there.

176
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,206
Don't badmouth your old man.

177
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.

178
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,710
It's not right.

179
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,914
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.

180
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,319
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three...

181
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,222
...just drank his fourth cup...

182
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,693
...of duck sauce.

183
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,095
K, the crashed ship...

184
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,998
...from this morning
was stolen from--

185
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:32,830
Lunar-Max.

186
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:33,937
Boris the Animal.

187
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,163
How did you know?

188
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,774
He has a taste for Spiky Bulba.

189
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,504
Give us a minute, chief.

190
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,370
We're in a situation.

191
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,281
Oh, yeah.

192
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,506
I take the Chloropod.

193
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,777
You take the Tarantabee.

194
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,420
And the Hydronian over there.

195
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,679
I'll take the kitchen.

196
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,448
Meet you on the street.

197
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,415
This is a very confusing time...

198
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,890
...in my life.

199
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,675
Hey.

200
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,889
Keep your mouth closed,
keep your head down.

201
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,548
Hello, K.

202
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,823
Boris the Animal.

203
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,554
It's just Boris.

204
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,824
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

205
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,398
Yes, my arm.

206
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,996
We've thought about that moment...

207
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,706
...every day for the last 40 years.

208
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,901
Well, that's just not living a full life.

209
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,774
I can promise you
it will be longer than yours.

210
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,678
Lonelier too. Since you're
the last Boglodite standing.

211
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,680
We'll see about that.

212
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,584
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.

213
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,883
Yo, K.

214
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,718
-Where the hell have you been?
-Fishing.

215
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,978
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

216
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,084
You all right?

217
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,502
May I have everyone's attention,
please?

218
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,738
Thank you.

219
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,969
You know how your kid won
the goldfish in that little baggie...

220
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,740
...from the fair and you didn't
want it in your house...

221
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,351
...so you told your kid it ran away
when you flushed it down the toilet?

222
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,009
Well, this is what happens.

223
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,418
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie to your kids.

224
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,290
Man, I am getting too old for this.

225
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,798
I can only imagine how you feel.

226
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,028
Boris the Animal.

227
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,605
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

228
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,842
Why? Was he innocent?

229
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,941
Should have killed him.

230
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,109
-Well, shit, let's go get him.
-No.

231
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,040
-No.
-Leave it alone.

232
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,446
It's above your pay grade.

233
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,348
We have the same pay grade.

234
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,452
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.

235
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,560
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit
of that bass out your voice.

236
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,290
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is
running around, this is my business.

237
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,832
You forget about Boris
or my report will reflect...

238
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,993
...that your conduct
has been unbecoming.

239
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,496
Well, maybe my report
is gonna reflect some shit too, K.

240
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,165
-You are suspended for two weeks.
-Bullshit.

241
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,311
Four weeks.

242
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,546
How about I quit?

243
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,978
There are things out there
you don't need to know.

244
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,176
That's not the lie you told me
when you recruited me.

245
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,157
What up, pops?

246
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,993
-Lose your partner?
-Yeah.

247
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,830
Next shuttle to Afazumba...

248
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,871
...Ieaving in 22 minutes.

249
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:21,947
Search...

250
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,109
...Boris the Animal.

251
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,552
Boris the Animal,
Boglodite assassin.

252
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,521
Boglodites were a rogue alien race...

253
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,684
... that consumed all planets
in their path.

254
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,726
Boris the Animal
was the only suspect...

255
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,058
...in a series of alien murders
on Earth.

256
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,195
Incident report.

257
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,891
Boris the Animal was convicted...

258
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,903
...for the following murders
that occurred on July 15, 1969.

259
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:45,634
Murder number one: Coney Island,
10: 37 a.m. Roman the Fabulist.

260
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,938
Murder number two: The Factory..

261
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:48,772
Refine search.

262
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:49,811
Agent K.

263
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,449
Junior Agent K apprehended
and arrested...

264
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:57,146
...Boris the Animal on July 16, 1969,
at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

265
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,755
-Cape Canaveral....
-Agent K...

266
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,392
...received highest commendation
for heroic action...

267
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,891
...including implementation...

268
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,722
...of the Arc Net Defense System...

269
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,387
... which protected the Earth
from Boglodite invasion...

270
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,261
...and led to the race's extinction.

271
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,423
Details.

272
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,034
Access restricted.

273
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:18,473
Excuse me? Clearance level
senior agent, class one. J.

274
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,838
Access denied.

275
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,542
What?

276
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,255
So why this sudden interest
in your partner's old exploits?

277
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,327
What happened between Boris and K?

278
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,433
That's easy.

279
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,627
K imprisoned Boris.
He put up the Arc Net.

280
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,329
He protected the Earth
from the Boglodites.

281
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,099
He did his job.

282
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,943
That's not what I'm asking.

283
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,772
Cape Canaveral, what happened?

284
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,710
Something that changed him.

285
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,013
Leave it at that.

286
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,321
So you two go way back, huh?

287
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,585
That's classified.

288
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,327
A word of advice, Agent J.

289
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,128
Don't ask questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

290
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,632
That's funny.
That is exactly what K said.

291
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,539
He's a very wise man.

292
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,042
Take the rest of the night off.

293
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,493
What?

294
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,233
Guess I owe you some answers,
hoss.

295
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,395
What, you're feeling chatty
all of a sudden?

296
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,368
I can't talk right now. I've got secret
cases of my own I'm working on.

297
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,773
I hate to tear you away
from your video game.

298
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,877
All right, I'm hanging up.

299
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,515
You know the most destructive force
in the universe?

300
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,151
Sugar?

301
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,144
Regret.

302
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,392
You don't have to wait. Just talk.

303
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,188
I promised you the secrets
of the universe. Nothing more.

304
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,365
So there's secrets out there
the universe don't know about?

305
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,137
Mommy.

306
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,954
Can I help you?

307
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,663
K?

308
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,828
5K.

309
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,839
I'm sorry, is that chocolate milk?

310
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,878
Can l--? I'm so sorry.
I don't know what....

311
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,875
Mommy, the president is drinking...

312
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,315
...my milk.

313
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,413
I'm sorry.

314
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,987
He didn't say please.

315
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,433
-K get in yet?
-Who?

316
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,509
You new?

317
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,341
Very funny, Agent J.

318
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:01,254
J, everything you told me yesterday,
you were right as rain.

319
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:04,020
-Thank God for that 10-hour stakeout.
-Who are you?

320
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,891
Exactly.
I feel like a whole new man today.

321
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,865
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life...

322
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,596
...but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my stepmom.

323
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,763
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

324
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,239
It's like I closed
this emotional window.

325
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,435
But I threw a brick
through that window.

326
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,477
Thank you for handing me
that brick, J.

327
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:26,344
Whoever you are, give me five feet
or I'll pluck you in your throat.

328
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,452
I'm gonna go
to the little Men's-in-Black room...

329
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:34,149
...then we'll go find those morons
from Pox Ethera. Lunch is on me.

330
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,053
Who was that?

331
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,129
Double A? Your partner.

332
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,227
I need you to go get me some
chocolate milk, all right?

333
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,065
Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?

334
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,763
Did he call in sick or anything?

335
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,408
Who's K?

336
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,811
All right, all right,
go ahead, go ahead.

337
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,742
K!

338
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,141
All right.

339
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,815
You got me.

340
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,249
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.

341
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,583
Oh, and all of you,
fantastic performances.

342
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,453
You waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humor...

343
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,322
...but this is a good one.

344
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,326
But I need you
to come out here now...

345
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,931
...because I'm starting
to get a little pissed off.

346
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,364
Agent J, would you mind
keeping your voice down...

347
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,435
...and telling me
who you're looking for?

348
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:20,696
I'm looking for K.

349
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,538
Who is K?

350
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,008
You too? You too.

351
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,145
I mean, who is he to you?

352
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,439
My partner.

353
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,109
Older gentleman, 110...

354
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,307
...maybe 111 years old.

355
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,445
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening
with him. He smiles like this.

356
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,721
Seen him around?

357
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,718
I'll take you to K.

358
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,726
Thank you.

359
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,539
-What is that supposed to be?
-That's K.

360
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,800
He's been dead for over 40 years.

361
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,374
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke
is that it be funny.

362
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,312
It's never been funny.

363
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,982
Computer, Agent K
and Boris the Animal.

364
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,854
Men in Black incident report,
July, 1969.

365
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,187
Location, Cape Canaveral.

366
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,728
Perpetrator Boris the Animal
escaped and fled Earth.

367
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,163
Assumed to have returned to planet
Boglodotia 20 light-years away.

368
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,667
Agent K pronounced dead at scene.
Awarded posthumous commendation...

369
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,739
...for action which prevented
greater loss of human life.

370
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,398
That's not what happened.

371
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,544
I looked at this report.
K put Boris away--

372
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,681
-Agent K is dead.
-Well, I just talked to him last night.

373
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,247
-You are imagining.
-I'm not.

374
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,384
-I need a psych team up here.
-Yes, ma'am.

375
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,386
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.

376
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,084
Every stakeout,
endless hours of cowboy music.

377
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,285
Every morning with his coffee...

378
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:55,091
...he'd say, "l tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt."

379
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,461
And I was supposed to say,
"What do you expect?

380
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,432
-lt was ground this morning."
-"This morning."

381
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,294
How do you know that?

382
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,870
Chocolate milk, sir?

383
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,533
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.

384
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:08,875
Wait.

385
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,914
How long have you been craving
chocolatized dairy products?

386
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,448
Just today.

387
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,244
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?

388
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,911
Loss of balance?

389
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,579
Agitation? Depression?

390
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:20,916
Hell, yeah.

391
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,657
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten...

392
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,319
...by a Hovartian brain tick...

393
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,965
...and could die in horrible agony
at any moment.

394
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,400
Damn it. It's not the tick.

395
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,505
"Damn it, it's not the tick"?

396
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,334
It's something worse than the tick?

397
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,005
Your obsession
with chocolate milk indicates...

398
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,774
...that you might be involved
in a temporal fracture.

399
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,780
I don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,351
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal-fracture headaches.

401
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,185
What's a temporal fracture?

402
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,345
A break in the timeline.

403
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,489
Don't know what you mean.

404
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,489
Time travel! Time travel.

405
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,860
There's no such thing
as time travel.

406
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,696
-Well, there is.
-No.

407
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:00,956
There's not.

408
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,565
Because if there were...

409
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,701
...a class-one senior agent
such as myself...

410
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,430
...would have been aware of it,
wouldn't he have?

411
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,131
Were it not classified
and way above his pay grade.

412
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,503
You know, I need a raise.

413
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,276
There was one man, scumbag,
Obadiah Price.

414
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,473
He figured it out, we busted him,
we made time travel illegal...

415
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,182
...throughout the universe
and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.

416
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,116
No-- That's where Boris
was locked up.

417
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,356
If Boris worked out
how to time jump...

418
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,224
...he could seriously change
the course of history.

419
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,633
Attention.
Early warning system engaged.

420
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,731
Inbound hostile warships
entering solar system.

421
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,963
Boglodite markings
and language detected.

422
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,576
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite,
but they're extinct.

423
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,040
Apparently not.

424
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,181
Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.

425
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,045
Put up the Arc Net.

426
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,910
-The what?
-The Arc Net. The defense system.

427
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,746
K got it for the Boglodites.

428
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,512
There is no K.

429
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,989
He's been dead for over 40 years.

430
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,755
No K. No defense system.

431
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,688
Boris jumped back and killed him.

432
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,767
If you wanna save the world,
stop that from happening.

433
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,636
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.

434
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,271
Let's hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

435
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:22,405
-Good luck, J!
-This planet's toast.

436
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,630
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale...

437
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,458
...on batteries.

438
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,261
Okay, we got other stuff,
like headphones, adapters or--

439
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,399
You helped Boris the Animal
time jump.

440
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,640
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.

441
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:50,796
He killed my partner.

442
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,375
I want to know when
and where you sent him.

443
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,876
What, you think I keep,
like, a logbook?

444
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,452
Target vector, July 16...

445
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,555
-...1969.
-All right.

446
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,452
That's a real bummer
about your buddy.

447
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,092
I'm sure he was a great guy.

448
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,285
But in terms of
the space-time continuum...

449
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,090
...your friend was a little blip
on the historical radar!

450
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,938
That's a big blip.

451
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,137
-Okay. What's the plan?
-You're gonna send me...

452
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,243
...back to July 15th, 1969.

453
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,175
No, that's a stupid plan,
because I sent Boris to July 16th.

454
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,248
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris...

455
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,850
...before the older one shows.

456
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,486
That way, neither of them
will even exist.

457
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,487
That's why you get to wear
the black suit.

458
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:40,918
No?

459
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,185
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.

460
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,852
Oh, I just thought of something.
Even back then...

461
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,123
...New York was like a big-ish city.

462
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,199
So how are you
gonna really find him?

463
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,828
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney lsland.

464
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,167
You're gonna get there first
and be waiting?

465
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,469
Dude, they should give you
two black suits.

466
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,872
My man, for real?

467
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:01,939
Oh, right.

468
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,341
Sorry.

469
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,510
This...

470
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,116
...is the real deal. Time-jump gear.

471
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,980
Very rare, very old.

472
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,315
But first, we gotta get high.

473
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,854
Hey. No.

474
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,692
No. No, I mean, really high.

475
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,576
Hey, man? A little help here?

476
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,648
Thank you.

477
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,687
Okay.

478
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,851
-You know the rules of time jumps?
-Give me the short version.

479
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,827
Okay. You wanna save your partner,
word of advice:

480
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,522
Stay away from him.

481
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,191
Yeah, got it. Stay away from K.
Just kill Boris.

482
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,200
Now, take these.

483
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,100
It gets pretty windy
on the way down.

484
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,500
The way down?

485
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,007
With eyes tearing up,
it's hard to read the dial.

486
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,579
Plus, it helps you look like a real
time traveler, which is cool.

487
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,841
I am not jumping off of this building!

488
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,882
Time jump.

489
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,916
Okay, now...

490
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,885
...I gotta set this thing...

491
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,615
...to the 15th.

492
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:22,852
That seems...

493
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,018
...right-ish.

494
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,056
Now...

495
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,699
...all you gotta do is jump.

496
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,267
Hey, hey, stop. Stop it.

497
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,132
When you're moving fast enough...

498
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,865
...that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green time-travel liquid...

499
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,771
...and it's gonna glow really bright.

500
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,572
As soon as that happens,
break that blue laser line...

501
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,715
...with your thumb
to complete the circuit.

502
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,907
At this height, that should be....

503
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,986
Let's see, mass of Earth
and 30-something feet per minute....

504
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,622
It's 32 feet per second. Per second.

505
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,758
That sounds right-ish.

506
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,260
So that would be, I guess,
about two feet off the ground.

507
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,727
I break the laser line?

508
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,887
No, don't break it!

509
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,000
-No, when I'm fast enough!
-Sounds good!

510
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,103
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?

511
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,262
Do not lose that time device...

512
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,399
...or you will be stuck in 1969!

513
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,411
It wasn't the best time
for your people.

514
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,607
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.

515
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,309
How will I know if it works?

516
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,318
You'll either know...

517
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,813
...or you won't.

518
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,194
You must really love this guy
to do this.

519
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,425
Oh, wait. How come I remember K,
but nobody else does?

520
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,166
-That means you were there!
-I was where?

521
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,309
If you survive, you gotta come back
and tell me everything.

522
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,137
Where was l?

523
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,803
You gotta go!

524
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:51,777
Just go, go, go!

525
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,066
Oh, no!

526
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:35,822
Come on!

527
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,757
-My man, what's today?
-Tuesday.

528
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,414
-The date?
-The 15th.

529
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,151
-Of?
-July.

530
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,455
-Dog, the year.
-1969.

531
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,257
Thank you.

532
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,862
Look at me like I'm crazy.

533
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,345
Far out.

534
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,981
Jerry rocked Haight-Ashbury
like you wouldn't believe.

535
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,291
Okay, we're here.

536
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,983
-Happy?
-You're such a pill, Fred.

537
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,664
-Get us checked in.
-Yeah, yeah.

538
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,528
Hey. Hey, do me a favor, all right?

539
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,898
-Be careful with the luggage.
-Absolutely, sir.

540
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,238
I paid a lot of money
for that luggage.

541
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,968
-We'll take good care--
-Last time, it got scuffed up.

542
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,610
Here you go, sir.
Just call down when you need it.

543
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,213
There's more in the trunk.

544
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,512
Yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.

545
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,622
Excuse me. Excuse me, who is that?
Who are you?

546
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:27,890
Let's go!

547
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,948
Far out, man!

548
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,881
If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.

549
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,646
Make love, not war.

550
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,182
I prefer to do both.

551
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,920
How are you, officers?
What can I do you for?

552
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,191
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seats.

553
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,463
-I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
-Yeah.

554
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,969
Yes, and it has a roof,
but it's hidden.

555
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,000
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

556
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,469
An individual of your...

557
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,578
...particular ethnic persuasion?

558
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,480
Maybe he's a noted athlete.

559
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:58,085
Yes. Starting forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

560
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,481
-Where'd you get the car?
-And the suit?

561
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,352
I stole them both.
Car from your wife...

562
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,358
...suit from your grandmother.

563
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:07,856
Hey.

564
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,863
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?

565
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,763
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.

566
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,933
-Hey, what's this?
-Probably drugs.

567
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,368
I have rights
and I demand to see my lawyer...

568
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,475
...before you press that small button
on the side firmly.

569
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,302
Press it.

570
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,641
That, gentlemen,
is a standard-issue neuralyzer.

571
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,286
You're not gonna remember that.

572
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,184
And just because you see
a black man driving a nice car...

573
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,655
...does not mean it's stolen.

574
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,193
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.

575
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,898
I'll be done
with the car in a minute!

576
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,666
Just find it and take it back
to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

577
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,491
Where is the Archanan?

578
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,716
You are too late.

579
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,554
He is going to give the humans...

580
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,388
...the Arc Net.

581
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,523
Let's agree to disagree.

582
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,628
We'll take it from here.

583
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,431
K?

584
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,094
K! K!

585
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,051
Dad, I'm on Earth.

586
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,849
I need bail.

587
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,401
Will the owner of a blue
warp-speed cruiser...

588
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,970
...please report to the front desk.

589
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,470
You need to turn the electricity
down on that damn thing.

590
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,808
Can't taste my fricking tongue, K.

591
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,109
How do you know my name?

592
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,451
What? Because I called you "K"?

593
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,749
No, I call everybody K.

594
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,656
It's kind of my thing.

595
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,986
What up, K?

596
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,454
All right, I sort of--

597
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,858
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just-- Some people like it.

598
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,161
Most people.

599
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,961
Now that I know what you look like...

600
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,765
...when you're lying, show me...

601
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,306
...what you look like
when you're telling the truth?

602
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,671
I won those at Coney lsland
on the ring toss.

603
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,278
I won a stuffed bear once,
but never one of these.

604
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,311
Must be good, slick.

605
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,176
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.

606
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,514
I was waiting for my girl,
who, by the way...

607
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,317
...is probably worried sick
looking for me right now.

608
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,484
So I just need my things
and I need to get back to her.

609
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,560
What's her name?

610
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,428
Your gal, what's her name?

611
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,323
Schtaron.

612
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,202
Schtaron?

613
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,944
I bet Schtaron
likes that suit of yours.

614
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,746
What, it's a crime
to wear a black suit?

615
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,813
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.

616
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,418
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be with you.

617
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:54,751
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney lsland incident.

618
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,448
Thanks for the heads-up.

619
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,826
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.

620
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,728
-What do you expect? It was--
-Just ground this morning.

621
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,498
O?

622
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,675
No, I call ladies "O."

623
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,868
To me, O is feminine,
K is masculine.

624
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:19,539
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K."

625
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,083
What a mess. Any casualties?

626
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,186
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.

627
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,584
Any human casualties?

628
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,885
No, sir.

629
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,190
Who the hell is this?

630
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:32,755
Look, I was--

631
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,922
-Stray human caught in the net.
-Code 43 him and throw him back.

632
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,193
You're late for a meeting
with the Viagrans.

633
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,461
They have a revolutionary new pill.

634
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:41,797
It's really....

635
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,700
Okay, slick.

636
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,639
I was waiting for my girl.

637
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:49,870
Schtaron.

638
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,709
Yes, she's Greek.

639
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:58,217
Okay. Just one last thing.
An eye exam.

640
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,427
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyzer!

641
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,760
You have a lot of information for
a fella who doesn't know anything.

642
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,298
I see what you're saying.

643
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,836
You know, K,
we need to hold up a second.

644
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,231
K!

645
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,767
Let's get this bite guard in here.

646
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,670
Hey, back up, back up.

647
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,611
K, listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, all right?

648
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,113
So let's just stop for a second
and talk.

649
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,978
Don't put me in here, K!

650
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,312
Too late, hoss.

651
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,478
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!

652
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,788
K!

653
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,321
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!

654
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,320
I'll just use my imagination.

655
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,768
K, the killer...

656
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,631
...you're looking for, I'm after
the same guy. A Boglodite.

657
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,829
His name is Boris.

658
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,132
Ship has sailed, amigo.

659
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,070
If we don't get him, there'll be two.

660
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,140
You had my undivided attention.

661
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,437
One will have one arm...

662
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,307
...and one's gonna have two. K!

663
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,812
Listen to me!

664
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,949
If you erase me...

665
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,345
...you erase the world!

666
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,218
Fifteen seconds...

667
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,618
...to neuralyzation. Fourteen.

668
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,450
Thirteen. Twelve.

669
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,527
Eleven. Ten. Nine.

670
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:17,633
When you see Boris tomorrow, K,
kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!

671
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,834
Four. Three. Two.

672
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,242
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!

673
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,739
It's whirring and buzzing.

674
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,882
I don't know if I don't know nothing.

675
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,257
I knew Roman.

676
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,323
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant...

677
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:46,985
...he was my friend.

678
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,159
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

679
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,339
I'm an agent...

680
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,098
...from the future. We're partners.

681
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,936
In 25 years, you'll recruit me...

682
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,203
...and 14 years after that,
the guy you didn't let me kill today...

683
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,371
...escapes from prison,
jumps to the past...

684
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,212
...and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him...

685
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,048
...so, really, we need to go right now.

686
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:20,757
All right.

687
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,233
So that's the story you believe.

688
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,429
That one was the truth.

689
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,699
Wasn't the whole truth,
but it'll do for now.

690
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,969
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.

691
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,375
The problem with a lie is once
you start lying you put yourself....

692
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,911
Agent K.

693
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,785
What's he still doing here?

694
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,787
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.

695
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,790
I put my pants on.

696
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,990
Okay, future man, where to?

697
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,595
I don't know.

698
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,760
What do you mean?

699
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,809
I don't know.
Go wherever you went last time.

700
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,412
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?

701
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,981
No. I mean, we don't really talk.

702
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,319
What kind of partners sit in a car
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

703
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:23,086
Exactly. And this is the type
of problem it causes.

704
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,284
It's dysfunctional.

705
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:28,624
All right, sport, you better get useful
real quick or you go back in room 43.

706
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,328
Man....

707
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,638
There was something in the file
about a factory.

708
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,969
Something happened at a factory.

709
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,813
Hey, look, man, you can put
your Jedi Knight on me all you want.

710
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,245
That's all I got.

711
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,648
That spark something?

712
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:56,519
Roman had this on his person
when he was murdered.

713
00:49:59,029 --> 00:49:59,688
It's a matchbook.

714
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,761
No, it's a clue.

715
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,557
He didn't smoke.

716
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,164
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

717
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,897
No.

718
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,365
Hey, man, how old are you?

719
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,063
Twenty-nine.

720
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,497
You got some city miles on you.

721
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,278
I'm starting to understand
why we don't talk.

722
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,882
-How well do you know this place?
-I know its reputation.

723
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:03,019
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.

724
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,422
Sure thing, slick.

725
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:08,029
K! Wait, no, I gotta go in
with you!

726
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,960
You sit tight. I'll be fine.

727
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,294
Wait, no! No!

728
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,265
K!

729
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,133
K, don't go in by yourself!

730
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,706
Hi, fellas.

731
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,377
Need to see the boss.

732
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:24,873
He's busy.

733
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,074
Well, I'm gonna just
take a look around.

734
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,224
Looks like we have ourselves
a standoff.

735
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,361
Looks that way.

736
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,462
-Still keep the key under the ashtray.
-Lucky guess.

737
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,159
Now, where were we?

738
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,235
I was about to tell you to screw off.

739
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,271
Hey, slick, you bowl in the future?

740
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,602
MiB league champ,
three years running.

741
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,438
Well, let's see it.

742
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,641
You did not walk into my...

743
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,611
...establishment
and rip my head off!

744
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,275
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.

745
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,114
I'll tell him this!

746
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,277
All right, your head.

747
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:10,449
Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down...

748
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,787
...and make sure you...

749
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,452
...walk funny for the rest...

750
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,689
...of your miserable last days
on Earth!

751
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,789
Tough spare, slick.

752
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,196
You messed with the wrong head!

753
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,529
-His head's a little....
-You gonna tell us...

754
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,195
...where Dom is?

755
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,670
I'll kill you both.
I'll kill both of youse!

756
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,275
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?

757
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,039
-Sure thing.
-No, no, no.

758
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,981
Come on, I just cleaned
the bathroom with this thing!

759
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,450
No cleaning! No cleaning!

760
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:41,614
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.

761
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,351
But he's not gonna talk
to Men in Black scum like you.

762
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,189
Now give me back my head.

763
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:49,731
K, I call this one
"Low Hanging Fruit."

764
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,194
That ain't a finger hole...

765
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,063
...you sick bastard!

766
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,396
I'll pop your head off...

767
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,970
...and see how you like it.

768
00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,837
I'm gonna kill both of you!

769
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,302
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!

770
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,969
I'll kill you both!

771
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,453
-Well, we're on the right track.
-Just the wrong train.

772
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,151
If he had any secrets...

773
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,812
...I'm guessing he spilled them.

774
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,356
A smart man figures out
what victims have in common.

775
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,016
A smart man would.

776
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,594
That's a big-ass phone.

777
00:53:20,546 --> 00:53:23,242
-Don't put that up to your head.
-Agent O.

778
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:25,816
How's your day been, Agent K?

779
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:27,111
Fair to middling.

780
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:28,275
How are things going?

781
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:29,648
Very. good, thank you.

782
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:31,584
Hey, you saw her like an hour ago.

783
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:33,952
I need cleanup and containment
at Cosmic Lanes.

784
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:36,060
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

785
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:38,924
Now Roman was a Byvoid,
correct me if I'm wrong...

786
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:42,727
-...from the same planetary grouping?
-A system in the Triangulum Galaxy...

787
00:53:42,902 --> 00:53:44,130
...wiped out by Boglodites.

788
00:53:44,303 --> 00:53:45,497
Wasn't the third planet--?

789
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:47,434
-Glamouria?
-Glamouria.

790
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:50,166
Thank you, Miss O.

791
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:53,768
I know where Boris
is headed to next.

792
00:53:53,946 --> 00:53:58,618
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.

793
00:54:02,421 --> 00:54:05,447
Look, if Boris turns out
to be here, I'm gonna kill him...

794
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,150
-...I need my gun.
-No deal.

795
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:11,586
I've been an agent for 14 years.

796
00:54:11,764 --> 00:54:15,291
Which means I'm the senior agent
on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank...

797
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:17,493
...but I am instructing
my junior agent...

798
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,605
...that's you, to give me my gun
right now. That's an order.

799
00:54:27,546 --> 00:54:29,013
No, no, no, space gun.

800
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:30,614
You're welcome.

801
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,040
I didn't say thank you.

802
00:54:39,158 --> 00:54:41,649
For such an ungainly species,
they've thrived on Earth.

803
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:43,385
I was an agent for three years...

804
00:54:43,562 --> 00:54:45,621
...before I realized
all models were aliens.

805
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:47,959
Found out the hard way.

806
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:49,062
Password?

807
00:54:49,301 --> 00:54:51,895
Hey, look, funky '60s dude,
we don't have a lot of time.

808
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:53,368
Janis Joplin.

809
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:04,081
Is there anybody here
who's not an alien?

810
00:55:09,455 --> 00:55:10,513
Very nice.

811
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,316
Blink. That's good.

812
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:13,457
Look in the camera.

813
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,659
Is that Andy Warhol?

814
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,724
Yep.

815
00:55:20,766 --> 00:55:23,997
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
could we have a minute?

816
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:27,367
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.

817
00:55:27,873 --> 00:55:28,703
Just a few...

818
00:55:28,874 --> 00:55:30,102
...questions.

819
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:33,439
No questions. No answers.

820
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:35,239
Just being.

821
00:55:35,614 --> 00:55:37,844
We have an urgent matter
to discuss with you...

822
00:55:38,017 --> 00:55:39,848
...regarding one
of your party guests.

823
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,687
Why don't you come back...

824
00:55:42,855 --> 00:55:44,846
...next week, after the happening...

825
00:55:45,024 --> 00:55:46,787
...has happened.

826
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:50,787
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like
talking slow. We got stuff to do.

827
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:52,190
I've got a planet to save.

828
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,760
You're distressing. Everything...

829
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,526
...about you upsets me.

830
00:56:00,372 --> 00:56:02,397
Damn it, K!
Are you trying to blow my cover?

831
00:56:02,575 --> 00:56:04,270
Agent W, your cover is safe.

832
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:06,272
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?

833
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:07,275
Safe?

834
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:09,437
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas...

835
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:11,810
...I'm painting cans
and bananas for chrissakes.

836
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:14,746
Actually, Mr. Warhol,
I gotta tell you, I love your work.

837
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,248
Oh, thank you.

838
00:56:16,422 --> 00:56:17,320
Who's the dumb-ass?

839
00:56:18,524 --> 00:56:20,651
How about a little
professional courtesy here?

840
00:56:20,826 --> 00:56:22,123
-Dumb-ass.
-Say it again.

841
00:56:22,294 --> 00:56:23,454
-Want me to?
-I dare you.

842
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:24,425
Dumb-ass.

843
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:26,258
-Agents.
-I have no problem...

844
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:28,764
...pimp-slapping the shiznit
out of Andy Warhol.

845
00:56:29,435 --> 00:56:30,094
What?

846
00:56:35,674 --> 00:56:36,936
Why are you looking at me?

847
00:56:39,678 --> 00:56:42,010
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K...

848
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:44,843
...you see what information
you can get from Agent W...

849
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,245
...and I'll go case the perimeter.

850
00:56:47,419 --> 00:56:49,114
-That work for everybody?
-Go do that.

851
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:50,755
-How about that?
-Oh, cute.

852
00:56:50,923 --> 00:56:52,788
-Okay.
-Very nice.

853
00:56:53,058 --> 00:56:55,356
Someone forget his nap?

854
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:05,067
Hey, how you doing?

855
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:07,672
Chilling.

856
00:57:12,945 --> 00:57:13,639
Who's that guy?

857
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:15,540
Don't tell me he's your new partner.

858
00:57:15,714 --> 00:57:19,309
Actually, he's my old partner.
He traveled back from the future--

859
00:57:19,485 --> 00:57:21,612
Stop, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

860
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:23,550
Andy, Yoko's here.

861
00:57:23,722 --> 00:57:25,622
Yoko's here.

862
00:57:26,725 --> 00:57:31,025
Tell her that I'm filming this man
eating a hamburger.

863
00:57:31,597 --> 00:57:33,792
It's transcendent.

864
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:36,363
All right, now the pickle.

865
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:45,142
What are you doing on my turf?

866
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:46,875
Tracking a killer. Boglodite.

867
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,571
We believe he's gonna
hit here next, a Glamourian.

868
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:52,808
Glamourian?
Right solar system, wrong planet.

869
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:54,509
He's gotta be after the Archanan.

870
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,915
Archanans are extinct.

871
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:59,022
Apparently not.
One washed ashore last week.

872
00:57:59,258 --> 00:58:02,352
The whole Roswell circuit's
all abuzz about it.

873
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:04,925
Alien unicorn. Last of its species.

874
00:58:05,631 --> 00:58:06,655
His name's Griffin.

875
00:58:07,132 --> 00:58:09,191
Griffin the Archanan.

876
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:11,994
How's it going?

877
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:15,607
Going? How's it going? That depends.
For me, personally, things are good.

878
00:58:15,774 --> 00:58:17,264
Unless we're in the future...

879
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:19,775
...where the muscle boy argues
with his girlfriend.

880
00:58:19,945 --> 00:58:22,846
She storms off and bumps the guy
with the stuffed mushrooms...

881
00:58:23,015 --> 00:58:25,074
...who dumps the tray
on the sailors on leave.

882
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,513
A shoving match breaks out.

883
00:58:26,685 --> 00:58:29,518
They crash into the table.
In which case, I gotta move my plate.

884
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:36,524
Or it's the future where
the pastrami sandwich I'm eating...

885
00:58:36,695 --> 00:58:38,390
...causes me gastric distress.

886
00:58:38,564 --> 00:58:41,192
Thankfully, your friend offers
the antacids he carries...

887
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:44,200
...in his right pocket, so good.
I'll be good.

888
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:47,305
Except in the future where
I have to leave in two minutes...

889
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:49,907
...before he has a chance
to offer me the antacids...

890
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:53,067
...so on the whole, I'd have to say
not good. I am not good.

891
00:58:55,247 --> 00:58:56,908
But that depends.

892
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:00,281
K!

893
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:01,980
How will we find this guy?

894
00:59:02,187 --> 00:59:03,916
What am l, a schmuck?

895
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:05,082
He's here?

896
00:59:05,257 --> 00:59:08,283
"Here" is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.

897
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,758
They can live in and visualize
an infinite set...

898
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,125
...of time-space probabilities
simultaneously.

899
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:15,223
Sounds like fun. Good work.

900
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:16,834
Whoa, whoa, K, K, K.

901
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:20,635
You gotta fake my death, okay?

902
00:59:20,806 --> 00:59:22,899
I can't listen to sitar music anymore.

903
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:25,768
All right, I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to X.

904
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:28,147
K, I can't tell
the women from the men.

905
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:29,441
May I see your watch?

906
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:31,343
Oh, it is 7:18.

907
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,241
No, no, your other watch,
the one your father gave you.

908
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:38,214
How do you know
about my father's watch?

909
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,122
Oh, dear.

910
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:45,258
This is the one
where Roman is dead...

911
00:59:45,431 --> 00:59:48,025
...and the gentleman at the
bowling alley. So much death.

912
00:59:48,233 --> 00:59:51,669
Such an infinitesimally
small chance for success.

913
00:59:52,538 --> 00:59:53,527
K!

914
00:59:53,772 --> 00:59:54,431
Griffin, right?

915
00:59:55,441 --> 00:59:56,100
We're here--

916
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:57,367
Because of Boris.

917
00:59:57,609 --> 00:59:58,769
We think he's coming--

918
00:59:58,944 --> 01:00:00,502
To kill me.
He'll be here in minutes...

919
01:00:00,746 --> 01:00:01,713
...unless we're in...

920
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,347
...the future
where he made the lights...

921
01:00:03,515 --> 01:00:04,504
...and is about...

922
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:05,877
...to shoot from the door...

923
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:07,382
...in which case we're all dead.

924
01:00:09,822 --> 01:00:11,949
Good, that was a close one.

925
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:13,523
K, I need a space gun.

926
01:00:13,993 --> 01:00:14,789
The Boglodites...

927
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,359
...consume any planet
in their path.

928
01:00:16,528 --> 01:00:17,825
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'.

929
01:00:17,997 --> 01:00:21,831
I tried to stop them, but if we stop
them here, if we deny them Earth...

930
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:24,128
...we can stop them.
They'll starve before...

931
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:25,361
...they reach the next planet.

932
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:29,467
Sixty-three seconds.

933
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,206
How do we do that? Stop them?

934
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,571
What?

935
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,047
Sorry. I have something for you.

936
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,376
A gift. It can protect you.

937
01:00:39,084 --> 01:00:42,576
I had to hide it from Boris,
but if you find me again...

938
01:00:43,288 --> 01:00:45,051
...I'll give it to you.

939
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:48,885
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

940
01:00:49,194 --> 01:00:50,718
What do you mean? What miracle?

941
01:00:50,896 --> 01:00:52,488
Thirty seconds. I have to go.

942
01:00:52,664 --> 01:00:53,596
No, we got you.

943
01:00:53,799 --> 01:00:56,199
Negative possibilities are
multiplying as we speak.

944
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:57,665
-Okay.
-Twenty seconds.

945
01:00:57,836 --> 01:00:58,495
All right.

946
01:00:58,670 --> 01:00:59,602
We got it, relax.

947
01:00:59,805 --> 01:01:01,932
If your watch is broken
and I have gastric--

948
01:01:02,107 --> 01:01:04,871
Fly! Find your place in the world!

949
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:06,705
Oh, dear.

950
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:08,846
Boris is coming through that door...

951
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:09,708
...in 12...

952
01:01:09,882 --> 01:01:11,509
...11, 10--

953
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:12,445
Wait!

954
01:01:12,618 --> 01:01:14,210
Did you have chocolate milk?

955
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:16,113
Yes.

956
01:01:17,222 --> 01:01:18,246
Cindy.

957
01:01:19,825 --> 01:01:20,587
K!

958
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:21,589
-Griffin!
-Got him.

959
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:31,928
Damn it!

960
01:01:51,356 --> 01:01:52,789
I'm good, I'm good.

961
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,152
What you got?

962
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:57,358
Damn it! We had him!

963
01:01:57,596 --> 01:01:59,461
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.

964
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:01,926
First of all, my name is J, okay?

965
01:02:02,101 --> 01:02:05,002
It's not "son," it's not "slick"
and it damn sure ain't no "Cochise."

966
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:08,100
I'm not gonna relax because
we're running out of time...

967
01:02:08,273 --> 01:02:09,831
...and there's an invasion coming.

968
01:02:10,008 --> 01:02:12,977
You're not really recognizing
my voicial intensity.

969
01:02:14,613 --> 01:02:16,604
But there was one guy
who could help.

970
01:02:16,882 --> 01:02:18,816
Hey, Griffin! Griffin! Where's Griffin?

971
01:02:19,885 --> 01:02:21,648
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?

972
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:25,890
He's gone. If Boris gets to him
before we do, that's no bueno.

973
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:27,485
We need pie.

974
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:30,192
-What?
-My granddaddy always said:

975
01:02:30,395 --> 01:02:32,590
"lf you got a problem
you can't solve...

976
01:02:32,764 --> 01:02:34,925
...it helps to get out
of your head." Pie.

977
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:36,463
-Pie?
-Yeah.

978
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:38,262
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?

979
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:41,002
-A little bit.
-Yeah, you know what?

980
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:42,697
We've been doing smart stuff:

981
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:45,035
We've been following clues,
doing police work.

982
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,335
It might be time
we do something stupid.

983
01:02:47,913 --> 01:02:50,473
Something that ain't got
nothing to do with nothing.

984
01:02:50,649 --> 01:02:52,549
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.

985
01:02:52,718 --> 01:02:54,117
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.

986
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,321
Sounds good.

987
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:27,183
Have any specials?

988
01:03:27,953 --> 01:03:31,218
He'll have what he always has after
he reads the menu for 10 minutes...

989
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,823
...and asks about specials.

990
01:03:32,991 --> 01:03:35,653
A slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

991
01:03:35,827 --> 01:03:37,351
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.

992
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:39,258
It's my last meal,
I'm gonna splurge.

993
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:46,204
World-class serial killer out there
and we're having pie.

994
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,873
What do you do in your spare time,
stretch?

995
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:53,741
See, I sense you're not embracing
the concept here.

996
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:55,937
Pie don't work unless you let it.

997
01:03:56,114 --> 01:03:57,513
I'm gonna let it.

998
01:03:57,683 --> 01:03:59,048
And you say we don't talk?

999
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:02,585
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.

1000
01:04:02,754 --> 01:04:06,485
As long as it doesn't have to do
with the case. Just let her rip.

1001
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:10,290
What's up with you and O?

1002
01:04:11,797 --> 01:04:12,491
Me and O?

1003
01:04:13,632 --> 01:04:15,065
Yeah, you and O.

1004
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:16,565
All right, all right.

1005
01:04:16,768 --> 01:04:18,429
All right, this is it.

1006
01:04:19,738 --> 01:04:23,071
A while back, I was assigned
to keep tabs on a musician.

1007
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:24,104
Mick Jagger?

1008
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:26,437
He's in this British band,
the Rolling Stones.

1009
01:04:26,745 --> 01:04:27,712
Rings a bell.

1010
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:31,144
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women.

1011
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:34,580
So I was in London
and that's when I met O.

1012
01:04:34,753 --> 01:04:38,712
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.

1013
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:42,953
And we find ourselves in this pub,
which is a bar, all right?

1014
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:47,121
Warm beer and the worst food
you ever ate.

1015
01:04:47,532 --> 01:04:51,059
We just played darts
till the sun came up.

1016
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:52,931
Neither of us wanted to leave.

1017
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:04,440
What the hell happened
to you, man?

1018
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:07,318
I don't know. It hasn't happened yet.

1019
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:11,422
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

1020
01:05:12,057 --> 01:05:13,319
I got you.

1021
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,154
I cannot believe this,
freaking New York Mets.

1022
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:17,693
Total losers!

1023
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:19,660
It's a rough time
to be a Mets fan.

1024
01:05:19,831 --> 01:05:22,356
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.

1025
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:25,693
That's funny. The Mets actually
win it all this year.

1026
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:27,302
Oh, yeah.

1027
01:05:27,572 --> 01:05:28,334
No, I'm serious.

1028
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,201
I'm sure.

1029
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:31,934
Look, three months from now,
your buddies down there...

1030
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,271
...are gonna be calling them
the Amazing Mets...

1031
01:05:34,446 --> 01:05:36,937
...and the Miracle Mets.

1032
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,446
What?

1033
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:42,280
What you got there, hoss?

1034
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:47,725
The Archanan said, "It's amazing!
It's a miracle! I'll see you at the game."

1035
01:05:48,894 --> 01:05:50,293
I know where he is.

1036
01:05:51,096 --> 01:05:53,165
Told you to trust the pie.

1037
01:05:57,402 --> 01:06:00,894
If Griffin's here for a game,
he's either too early or too late.

1038
01:06:01,106 --> 01:06:04,405
He's here. We just gotta find him
before Boris does.

1039
01:06:11,683 --> 01:06:13,583
It's time to give you
your things back...

1040
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:14,844
...partner.

1041
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,145
You get some pie in you,
you get all mushy.

1042
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:19,483
I'm just tired of carrying your stuff.

1043
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:23,057
Come on now! All right! Let's go...

1044
01:06:23,228 --> 01:06:24,092
...Mets!

1045
01:06:24,262 --> 01:06:26,753
Let's go, Mets! Let's go...

1046
01:06:26,932 --> 01:06:29,162
-...Mets! Let's go, Met--
-Griffin?

1047
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,337
You're just in time!

1048
01:06:33,505 --> 01:06:37,839
Unless this is the one where Robinson
bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.

1049
01:06:39,945 --> 01:06:41,344
Are we missing something?

1050
01:06:42,147 --> 01:06:43,341
The game.

1051
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:15,208
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.

1052
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,077
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.

1053
01:07:19,584 --> 01:07:21,609
This game doesn't happen
till October.

1054
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,118
It's always October...

1055
01:07:23,388 --> 01:07:24,946
...and November and March.

1056
01:07:25,123 --> 01:07:28,115
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.

1057
01:07:28,293 --> 01:07:30,090
Until then, they're all happening.

1058
01:07:30,262 --> 01:07:33,231
Like this one, it's my favorite moment
in human history.

1059
01:07:33,398 --> 01:07:36,765
All the things that had to converge
for the Mets to win the World Series.

1060
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:40,098
They were in last place every single
season until they won it all.

1061
01:07:40,272 --> 01:07:41,569
You said you had a gift.

1062
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,570
That baseball...

1063
01:07:42,741 --> 01:07:46,643
...thrown for the last out of game five,
manufactured in '62 by Spalding...

1064
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:50,270
...of Chicopee, Massachusetts,
was aerodynamically flawed...

1065
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:52,781
...due to the horsehide
being improperly tanned...

1066
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:54,782
...because the tanner's wife
left him...

1067
01:07:54,953 --> 01:07:56,443
...for a Puerto Rican golf pro--

1068
01:07:56,621 --> 01:07:58,111
The gift?

1069
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,520
Oh, yes, of course. In the box.

1070
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:07,362
It's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.

1071
01:08:07,532 --> 01:08:08,430
It's a shield.

1072
01:08:13,138 --> 01:08:13,797
Shield.

1073
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,865
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.

1074
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:19,806
-How?
-When that ball is pitched to...

1075
01:08:19,978 --> 01:08:20,808
...Davey Johnson...

1076
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:22,173
...who became a player...

1077
01:08:22,347 --> 01:08:25,805
...because his dad couldn't find a
football to give him for his birthday...

1078
01:08:25,984 --> 01:08:26,712
...it hits...

1079
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:28,853
...his bat two micrometers
too high...

1080
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,351
...popping out to Cleon Jones...

1081
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:33,453
... who would've been born Clara,
a statistical...

1082
01:08:33,658 --> 01:08:37,116
... typist, if his parents didn't have
an extra glass of wine that night...

1083
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:39,160
...before going to bed.

1084
01:08:40,398 --> 01:08:41,330
A miracle...

1085
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,991
...is what seems impossible
but happens anyway.

1086
01:08:53,411 --> 01:08:54,878
I lost my planet.

1087
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,480
I don't want you to lose yours.

1088
01:08:57,649 --> 01:09:00,140
It'll take a miracle,
but if you pull this off...

1089
01:09:00,352 --> 01:09:02,343
...you'll be my new
favorite moment...

1090
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:04,352
...in human history.

1091
01:09:04,523 --> 01:09:05,990
Oh, dear.

1092
01:09:06,424 --> 01:09:08,051
I forgot to see this one coming.

1093
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,224
Damn it!

1094
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:27,571
Have these in the future?

1095
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,838
No.

1096
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,069
Get on.

1097
01:09:33,852 --> 01:09:35,843
Keep gyro settings at zero gain.

1098
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:38,581
Balance pitch and yaw
with bursts on the center stalk...

1099
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,122
...between 80 and 100 psi.

1100
01:09:40,592 --> 01:09:41,616
I didn't understand...

1101
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:43,225
...any of that!

1102
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:45,454
-Gyro at zero gain.
-lt is.

1103
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:48,030
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the center stalk.

1104
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:48,858
I did!

1105
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:50,968
Between 80 and 100 psi!

1106
01:09:52,037 --> 01:09:53,061
Got it.

1107
01:09:55,707 --> 01:09:57,572
The Arc Net! Give it to me!

1108
01:09:57,742 --> 01:09:59,607
This isn't the one where you get it!

1109
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,871
-All right there, chief?
-Hell, yeah.

1110
01:10:02,047 --> 01:10:03,571
It'd be better with four wheels!

1111
01:10:03,748 --> 01:10:05,079
Two is, like, my minimum.

1112
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,458
What happens if Boris
gets the Arc Net?

1113
01:10:14,626 --> 01:10:16,890
Boglodite invasion,
total destruction of Earth!

1114
01:10:41,086 --> 01:10:42,781
The box!

1115
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,261
Good boy.

1116
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,157
We gotta stop this guy!

1117
01:10:59,437 --> 01:11:00,301
I've been trying!

1118
01:11:00,505 --> 01:11:01,836
You haven't been trying?

1119
01:11:02,407 --> 01:11:03,032
Hey, slick.

1120
01:11:03,408 --> 01:11:06,434
In the future,
we ever do the Texas two-step?

1121
01:11:06,611 --> 01:11:08,272
Yes, sir!

1122
01:11:33,705 --> 01:11:34,672
Did you get him?

1123
01:11:35,006 --> 01:11:36,473
Give me a sec.

1124
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:41,743
Is he dead?

1125
01:11:42,213 --> 01:11:43,578
Negative.

1126
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:45,676
He got away.

1127
01:11:48,153 --> 01:11:49,984
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.

1128
01:12:04,736 --> 01:12:06,829
I feel younger already.

1129
01:12:33,064 --> 01:12:36,465
You pathetic waste
of Boglodite flesh.

1130
01:12:36,634 --> 01:12:39,933
I'd kill you right now,
if I didn't value my own life.

1131
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:41,968
-Who are you?
-Look at you.

1132
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:45,200
Every mistake I've ever made,
just waiting to happen.

1133
01:12:45,376 --> 01:12:46,536
What happened to my arm?

1134
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:48,941
You lose it, shot off by a human.

1135
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,581
No human could defeat me.

1136
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:55,215
You spend the next 40 years in prison,
chained up like an animal.

1137
01:12:55,386 --> 01:12:57,251
No prison can hold me!

1138
01:12:57,422 --> 01:13:00,118
They built one especially for us,
on the moon.

1139
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:02,255
No human has been to the moon...

1140
01:13:02,427 --> 01:13:05,089
...so they cannot have
built it there already.

1141
01:13:05,263 --> 01:13:08,255
Stop arguing! You can avoid
all of that if you just listen to me!

1142
01:13:08,433 --> 01:13:12,062
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!

1143
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:15,035
That wasn't me, that was you!

1144
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:21,278
What's your plan?

1145
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:23,740
Prevent the Arc Net
from being deployed.

1146
01:13:23,915 --> 01:13:26,440
-Kill anyone who tries.
-Good plan.

1147
01:13:26,951 --> 01:13:27,918
Didn't work.

1148
01:13:28,086 --> 01:13:29,053
With my help...

1149
01:13:29,287 --> 01:13:32,154
...we'll get the Arc Net,
kill Agent K...

1150
01:13:32,323 --> 01:13:34,621
...the invasion will be successful...

1151
01:13:34,826 --> 01:13:36,350
...and we'll get to keep both...

1152
01:13:36,561 --> 01:13:38,927
...of our ar--! Stop...

1153
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:40,587
...staring at it!

1154
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:42,591
Listen.

1155
01:13:57,949 --> 01:14:01,180
-You all right?
-Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.

1156
01:14:01,486 --> 01:14:02,384
It's what we do.

1157
01:14:03,454 --> 01:14:04,716
You still have the Arc Net?

1158
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:09,119
When you're being hunted
by Boris the Animal...

1159
01:14:09,294 --> 01:14:10,989
...you get good at hiding things.

1160
01:14:36,387 --> 01:14:38,480
This will save your world.

1161
01:14:41,392 --> 01:14:43,553
Once it's outside the atmosphere,
it gets...

1162
01:14:43,728 --> 01:14:45,025
...a whole lot bigger.

1163
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,062
All you have to do is deploy it.

1164
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:52,568
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?

1165
01:14:52,737 --> 01:14:55,399
It's just one small step.

1166
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:10,945
The moon launch.

1167
01:15:14,425 --> 01:15:16,086
Cape Canaveral.

1168
01:15:17,428 --> 01:15:20,295
July 16th, 1969.

1169
01:15:20,632 --> 01:15:22,259
We got six hours to get to Florida.

1170
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,965
Better get a move on, slick.

1171
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:25,236
Wait, hold up.

1172
01:15:25,403 --> 01:15:27,530
Not us.
I'm gonna do this one alone.

1173
01:15:27,705 --> 01:15:28,603
He has to be the--

1174
01:15:28,773 --> 01:15:29,637
Griffin.

1175
01:15:29,807 --> 01:15:30,933
What do you mean, alone?

1176
01:15:31,709 --> 01:15:33,574
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.

1177
01:15:33,745 --> 01:15:34,973
I need you to trust me.

1178
01:15:35,446 --> 01:15:39,143
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?

1179
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:40,784
You're not going to Florida.

1180
01:15:40,952 --> 01:15:42,715
That ain't gonna happen, partner.

1181
01:15:42,887 --> 01:15:44,252
Look, K...

1182
01:15:44,789 --> 01:15:47,087
...please, I will not allow you
to go to Florida.

1183
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:49,921
Stop me.

1184
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,566
You die there!

1185
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:02,398
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.

1186
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:06,140
Boris kills you there.

1187
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:10,103
That's what I'm here for.

1188
01:16:10,748 --> 01:16:12,238
That's what I came back to stop.

1189
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:14,418
Oh, dear. We're in this one.

1190
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:17,721
K...

1191
01:16:18,456 --> 01:16:20,583
...I saw the file,
I looked at the report.

1192
01:16:20,758 --> 01:16:21,952
I said I told you everything--

1193
01:16:23,594 --> 01:16:25,118
That's for lying to me.

1194
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:26,421
Look, I'm sorry, man!

1195
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,229
That's for telling me the truth!

1196
01:16:32,503 --> 01:16:34,368
I'm trying to protect you...

1197
01:16:35,606 --> 01:16:37,039
...man!

1198
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:41,772
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lies.

1199
01:16:45,516 --> 01:16:47,347
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

1200
01:16:47,518 --> 01:16:50,282
He must deploy the Arc Net
as he did before.

1201
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:51,945
There's no other way.

1202
01:16:52,523 --> 01:16:55,686
K is the only hope in saving Earth.

1203
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:58,051
Can I save him?

1204
01:16:58,963 --> 01:17:02,763
Is there any future
where I save his life?

1205
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,000
Yes.

1206
01:17:08,539 --> 01:17:10,769
But where there is death...

1207
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:14,143
...there will always be death.

1208
01:17:31,996 --> 01:17:33,827
According to you,
I've done this before.

1209
01:17:33,998 --> 01:17:35,397
So we know it's possible.

1210
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:37,534
If you're half the agent
you say you are...

1211
01:17:37,702 --> 01:17:40,000
...you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.

1212
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,377
So are we partners? You tell me.

1213
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:50,839
Let's go.

1214
01:18:03,928 --> 01:18:04,860
Agent K...

1215
01:18:05,029 --> 01:18:06,428
-...how are you?
-I'm good.

1216
01:18:06,597 --> 01:18:09,760
Okay, group hug on the way
to doing what we're doing.

1217
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:14,132
This morning, man is about to launch
himself on a trip to the moon...

1218
01:18:14,338 --> 01:18:16,806
...with the expectation
of landing there.

1219
01:18:16,974 --> 01:18:18,441
Look, I gotta ask you.

1220
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:21,009
If we pull this off,
fix things the way they were...

1221
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:22,942
...O and l, are we...?

1222
01:18:23,114 --> 01:18:24,308
A wise man once told me...

1223
01:18:24,482 --> 01:18:27,280
...don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

1224
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:31,281
-I said that, didn't l?
-Yes, sir.

1225
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,427
Here they are.

1226
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:40,423
-What are they?
-Jetpacks.

1227
01:18:40,598 --> 01:18:42,122
Jetpacks?

1228
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:45,964
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.

1229
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:48,469
There's a reason we don't
have these in the future.

1230
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:49,628
K, we gotta drive.

1231
01:18:50,074 --> 01:18:53,009
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan
in five hours, chief.

1232
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:57,247
Yeah, we can. The red button,
standard issue in every MiB car.

1233
01:18:57,415 --> 01:18:59,280
Press the red button,
goes into hyperdrive.

1234
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,247
No red buttons yet, slick.

1235
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:05,114
Come on, man.

1236
01:19:10,194 --> 01:19:11,024
Do you know...

1237
01:19:11,195 --> 01:19:12,492
...how to work this thing?

1238
01:19:12,663 --> 01:19:14,790
It's like with anything.

1239
01:19:14,966 --> 01:19:18,902
Just have to strap yourself in,
hope for the best.

1240
01:19:20,004 --> 01:19:21,301
Isn't that right, Miss O?

1241
01:19:22,673 --> 01:19:24,664
Unfortunately, it is.

1242
01:19:35,853 --> 01:19:37,150
You ready, slick?

1243
01:19:39,023 --> 01:19:40,547
Let's get it.

1244
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,622
This is gonna be interesting!

1245
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,838
It's just minutes to the...

1246
01:19:58,042 --> 01:19:59,669
...historic launch of Apollo 11...

1247
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:02,176
...with all going well.

1248
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:21,726
I'm so glad this isn't
one of the times we explode.

1249
01:20:21,999 --> 01:20:23,694
One of the times?

1250
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:28,061
Oh, we got company.

1251
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,077
The hell?

1252
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,614
Is that a battery belt?

1253
01:20:47,525 --> 01:20:49,049
All right, I got it.

1254
01:20:52,263 --> 01:20:54,788
No, any reality
that gets the shield deployed...

1255
01:20:55,032 --> 01:20:56,761
...is one where you tell the truth.

1256
01:20:57,134 --> 01:20:58,533
The truth?

1257
01:20:58,869 --> 01:21:00,860
The truth is the only path.

1258
01:21:01,072 --> 01:21:02,733
This is a restricted area!

1259
01:21:07,778 --> 01:21:09,746
Yes, sir, it is.

1260
01:21:09,914 --> 01:21:12,883
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

1261
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:16,713
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.

1262
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:18,980
We're from a secret government
organization...

1263
01:21:19,156 --> 01:21:22,717
...that polices and monitors
alien activity on and off planet Earth.

1264
01:21:24,128 --> 01:21:25,254
Here's the thing.

1265
01:21:25,429 --> 01:21:27,897
We have this special
little metal thingy...

1266
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:31,831
...that Griff gave us that we have
to get on top of that rocket...

1267
01:21:32,036 --> 01:21:35,631
...to prevent an alien invasion.

1268
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:40,008
That worked.

1269
01:21:40,177 --> 01:21:42,907
-Like a charm.
-Sir, Delta Gate. We have a problem.

1270
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:46,614
Three trespassers. No lDs,
but they've got weapons, sir.

1271
01:21:46,817 --> 01:21:48,978
Some kind I've never seen before.

1272
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:58,285
What breed of fool
do you have to be...

1273
01:21:58,462 --> 01:22:01,363
...to penetrate my site
on the day of the most massive feat...

1274
01:22:01,565 --> 01:22:02,793
...attempted by mankind?

1275
01:22:02,967 --> 01:22:05,868
Watched by God, the population
of the planet and my own...

1276
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:07,162
-...firstborn!
-Colonel?

1277
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:09,197
Colonel, they had these.

1278
01:22:10,374 --> 01:22:12,535
They said they needed
to put something on the rocket...

1279
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:13,870
...for an invasion.

1280
01:22:18,115 --> 01:22:19,104
Thanks.

1281
01:22:19,317 --> 01:22:20,579
I got 10 minutes to launch.

1282
01:22:20,818 --> 01:22:24,845
If you pose a threat to that rocket,
you tell me now and do not lie to me.

1283
01:22:29,293 --> 01:22:31,284
I told the truth last time.

1284
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,097
Sir, this man came here from...

1285
01:22:38,269 --> 01:22:39,668
...the future to protect me...

1286
01:22:39,837 --> 01:22:43,238
...so I can attach a shield to the top
of that rocket and save the world.

1287
01:22:43,407 --> 01:22:45,375
I need your help to do that.

1288
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:49,843
Take them to the brig.

1289
01:22:50,014 --> 01:22:51,504
You're slipping, Griff.

1290
01:22:52,049 --> 01:22:53,209
Sir, if I may.

1291
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,159
Corporal.

1292
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:12,900
You men are no longer needed.

1293
01:23:13,404 --> 01:23:14,530
I'll take the prisoners.

1294
01:23:14,905 --> 01:23:16,736
-Sir, are you--?
-Dismissed.

1295
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,572
Follow me.

1296
01:23:33,924 --> 01:23:36,119
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?

1297
01:23:36,293 --> 01:23:38,420
Only what he needed to see.

1298
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,163
I have to go now.

1299
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:43,699
What? No, no, no. Come on.

1300
01:23:44,101 --> 01:23:45,591
You don't need me anymore.

1301
01:23:46,036 --> 01:23:48,402
All right, Griff,
don't start flipping on me.

1302
01:23:48,572 --> 01:23:52,030
When Boris' arm is taken, the past
will be as it was. K will survive.

1303
01:23:52,209 --> 01:23:54,177
He will not know
you were ever here.

1304
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:59,941
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?

1305
01:24:00,117 --> 01:24:03,382
When that happens, go home.
Leave.

1306
01:24:03,554 --> 01:24:04,213
You coming?

1307
01:24:04,388 --> 01:24:06,379
Yeah, all right!

1308
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:10,793
Thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?

1309
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:12,824
Anything's possible.

1310
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:16,831
Oh, Griff.

1311
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,631
I can never bear to watch this part.

1312
01:24:27,578 --> 01:24:29,239
Armstrong and Aldrin
are scheduled...

1313
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:31,313
...to set foot on the moon...

1314
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:35,441
...on early Monday morning,
Eastern Daylight Time.

1315
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:37,583
Where's Griffin?

1316
01:24:37,788 --> 01:24:39,517
Doing his own thing.

1317
01:25:02,179 --> 01:25:02,873
Gentlemen.

1318
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:09,214
This elevator
will take you to the top.

1319
01:25:09,386 --> 01:25:11,377
T o get the Arc Net
outside the atmosphere...

1320
01:25:11,555 --> 01:25:14,547
...you need to strap it to the escape
rocket above the capsule!

1321
01:25:14,758 --> 01:25:16,123
You do not want to be...

1322
01:25:16,293 --> 01:25:18,523
...anywhere near this rocket
when it takes off!

1323
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,062
-Questions?
-No. Thank you for this, colonel.

1324
01:25:21,265 --> 01:25:22,823
Some job you got there.

1325
01:25:23,067 --> 01:25:24,227
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.

1326
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:26,892
What did Griff
show you back there?

1327
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:28,504
How important you are.

1328
01:25:28,839 --> 01:25:30,397
You and your partner.

1329
01:25:38,682 --> 01:25:41,082
If everything goes right
the way we hope it does...

1330
01:25:41,285 --> 01:25:44,015
...I'm gonna end up
getting out of here pretty quick...

1331
01:25:44,188 --> 01:25:47,589
...so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

1332
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:51,318
If things go wrong,
not gonna have a chance to, either.

1333
01:25:53,264 --> 01:25:54,891
So I guess win or lose, this is it.

1334
01:25:59,436 --> 01:26:01,336
I see why I recruited you.

1335
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,300
You're a good man.

1336
01:26:08,812 --> 01:26:10,404
Good man.

1337
01:26:12,883 --> 01:26:15,113
Man, what the hell
happened to you?

1338
01:26:15,553 --> 01:26:17,885
I told you,
it still hasn't happened yet.

1339
01:26:22,726 --> 01:26:24,421
I'll take this one!

1340
01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:25,920
Naughty.

1341
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:30,691
Get a pedicure if you get a second.

1342
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:42,738
And liftoff.

1343
01:27:24,188 --> 01:27:25,917
Just passed the two-minute mark...

1344
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:29,526
...in the countdown, and all is still go
as we monitor our status board.

1345
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:53,646
Astronauts report it feels good.
Power transfer is complete.

1346
01:27:54,418 --> 01:27:57,488
Neil Armstrong just reported back
it's been a smooth countdown.

1347
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:10,991
Hey!

1348
01:28:11,235 --> 01:28:12,862
Boris, can you give me a hand?

1349
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:14,834
Hey.

1350
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:20,305
Hey!

1351
01:28:21,245 --> 01:28:22,872
You hear me calling you?

1352
01:28:23,747 --> 01:28:25,237
Boris the Animal!

1353
01:28:25,749 --> 01:28:26,408
Hey!

1354
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:28,744
Boris the Animal!

1355
01:28:30,654 --> 01:28:33,020
It's just Boris!

1356
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:37,884
You're gonna lose.

1357
01:28:38,195 --> 01:28:39,457
Let's agree to disagree.

1358
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,243
Hey!

1359
01:29:01,285 --> 01:29:02,912
Boris the Animal!

1360
01:29:12,896 --> 01:29:13,692
Right.

1361
01:29:14,531 --> 01:29:15,190
Left.

1362
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,158
You're gonna lose.

1363
01:29:44,328 --> 01:29:46,387
Let's agree to disagree.

1364
01:29:55,272 --> 01:29:56,637
Hey!

1365
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:59,138
Boris the Animal!

1366
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:06,777
Right.

1367
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,675
Left. Left.

1368
01:30:09,787 --> 01:30:10,549
Right.

1369
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:16,593
That's not possible.

1370
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,794
Let's agree to disagree.

1371
01:30:24,501 --> 01:30:27,163
That's not possible!

1372
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,469
K!

1373
01:30:39,149 --> 01:30:41,481
I win! I'm better than me!

1374
01:30:48,892 --> 01:30:50,154
That's my partner.

1375
01:30:50,627 --> 01:30:52,458
That's my partner!

1376
01:30:58,669 --> 01:30:59,693
If we call this in...

1377
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:02,532
-...they'll scrub the launch.
-I didn't see anything.

1378
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:39,106
-Where's your partner?
-He went home.

1379
01:31:39,276 --> 01:31:40,766
-How does that work?
-You got me.

1380
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:42,241
Come on!

1381
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:57,890
Get down!

1382
01:32:28,959 --> 01:32:30,290
Bingo.

1383
01:32:31,228 --> 01:32:33,287
Man, that is some next-level stuff.

1384
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:44,638
You ever want to see more...

1385
01:32:44,841 --> 01:32:48,140
...I know a top-secret organization
that could use a man like you.

1386
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,741
I wish I could.

1387
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:53,283
Thank you.

1388
01:32:53,917 --> 01:32:55,782
I'll see you around, K.

1389
01:32:57,521 --> 01:32:58,215
Look out!

1390
01:33:03,493 --> 01:33:05,154
Go ahead.

1391
01:33:05,429 --> 01:33:07,158
Arrest me.

1392
01:33:08,765 --> 01:33:10,426
Not this time.

1393
01:33:20,444 --> 01:33:23,436
"Where there's death,
there will always be death."

1394
01:33:32,789 --> 01:33:36,020
Daddy! Daddy!

1395
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:40,892
Hey.

1396
01:33:41,965 --> 01:33:43,899
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?

1397
01:33:44,468 --> 01:33:45,492
James.

1398
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:48,194
James? That's a nice name.

1399
01:33:48,405 --> 01:33:49,770
Where's my dad?

1400
01:33:52,642 --> 01:33:54,507
What have you got there?
What is that?

1401
01:33:54,678 --> 01:33:56,043
My dad gave it to me.

1402
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:58,477
We timed the launch.

1403
01:34:05,589 --> 01:34:07,386
Where is my daddy?

1404
01:34:11,495 --> 01:34:12,894
He....

1405
01:34:13,497 --> 01:34:17,228
He went to go do something
very special.

1406
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:19,266
And he wanted me...

1407
01:34:19,436 --> 01:34:23,805
...to stay here and take care
of his best pal.

1408
01:34:28,678 --> 01:34:30,839
When is he gonna be back?

1409
01:34:32,015 --> 01:34:33,380
He....

1410
01:34:48,198 --> 01:34:49,631
James...

1411
01:34:51,034 --> 01:34:52,797
...if you look right here...

1412
01:34:52,969 --> 01:34:56,200
...I will tell you the only thing
you ever need to know.

1413
01:35:01,711 --> 01:35:03,474
Your daddy is a hero.

1414
01:35:03,713 --> 01:35:06,147
My daddy is a hero?

1415
01:35:09,386 --> 01:35:12,651
-Want to take a walk with me?
-Yes.

1416
01:35:22,232 --> 01:35:23,494
James?

1417
01:36:05,909 --> 01:36:07,536
You're late.

1418
01:36:07,711 --> 01:36:09,975
Sorry. Lost track of time.

1419
01:36:11,948 --> 01:36:13,142
How do you know that song?

1420
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:15,542
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.

1421
01:36:16,453 --> 01:36:18,216
What do you know
and what do you don't?

1422
01:36:18,421 --> 01:36:20,116
How do I know what I don't know?

1423
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:23,191
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?

1424
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,122
Yeah.

1425
01:36:24,461 --> 01:36:25,325
Boglodites?

1426
01:36:25,495 --> 01:36:26,291
Extinct for 40 years.

1427
01:36:26,696 --> 01:36:28,960
Perfect. Did we talk
on the phone last night?

1428
01:36:29,132 --> 01:36:30,360
You hung up on me.

1429
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,427
Yeah, I did.

1430
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,631
But that was because
of all those secrets...

1431
01:36:36,173 --> 01:36:39,074
...the universe doesn't know about.

1432
01:36:43,813 --> 01:36:44,575
But...

1433
01:36:44,981 --> 01:36:46,744
...I've realized that...

1434
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:49,418
...Iast night was a long...

1435
01:36:49,586 --> 01:36:51,884
...Iong time ago.

1436
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,889
And, really,
I just want to say thank you.

1437
01:36:59,496 --> 01:37:01,487
It's been my privilege.

1438
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:13,741
You know, there's a really
high possibility now...

1439
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:16,504
...that I might know some things
you don't know.

1440
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,238
I doubt it.

1441
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:20,383
I bet I know what went down
with you and O.

1442
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:22,450
She's a fine lady,
but you know the rules.

1443
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:24,780
There's no fraternizing
amongst agents.

1444
01:37:24,988 --> 01:37:27,684
I think y'all might have fraternized
a time or two.

1445
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:34,193
This is my new favorite moment
in human history.

1446
01:37:34,364 --> 01:37:37,595
Unless this is the one
where K forgot to leave a tip.

1447
01:37:52,215 --> 01:37:54,080
Almost forgot.

1448
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:04,321
That was a close one.
