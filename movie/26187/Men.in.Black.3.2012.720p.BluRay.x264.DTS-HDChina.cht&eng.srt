00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,813
鮑裏斯（Boris）

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,600
禽獸鮑裏斯有探監的
Well, well,
Boris the Animal has a visitor.

5
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,068
40年頭一個可以放行
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

6
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,573
只是塊蛋糕
It's a cake.

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,840
是什麼我說了才算
I decide what it is.

8
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,447
看起來像蛋糕
Looks like some kind of cake.

9
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,749
沒有異常，不是說沒衣裳哦，你懂的...
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know...

10
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,625
噢，天吶
Oh, God.

11
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,438
禽獸鮑裏斯
Boris the Animal...

12
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,474
有人來看你了
you've got a visitor.

13
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,007
是「鮑裏斯」
BORIS:
It's just Boris.

14
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,853
你的信對我來說就是
Your letters have been
soul-nourishing

15
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,784
心靈雞湯
tonic.

16
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,651
你本人可比
And you are much more

17
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,356
照片上帥多了
unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

18
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,139
這可不是夫妻探監
GUARD:
This ain't a conjugal visit.

19
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,676
別親了
So quit your conjugating...

20
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,144
你上次親熱是什麼時候？
When's the last time
you conjugated anything?

21
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,643
親愛的，看到你帶的禮物了
I see you've brought me a treat,
darling.

22
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,949
你能幫我們切開它嗎？
今天是個特殊的日子
Would you mind cutting this up
for us? It's a special day.

23
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,754
我很浪漫的
I'm a romantic like that.

24
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,498
要是我就不會這麼做
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

25
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,325
為什麼？
Why's mm.

26
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,229
會廢了你的手指
It'll ruin your figure.

27
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,646
你讓我完美無缺
You complete me.

28
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,426
大傢伙
The big one.

29
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,731
鮑裏斯！你答應帶我一起走的！
MAN: Boris!
You promised to take me with you!

30
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,967
我們說好的！
We had a deal!

31
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,336
奧巴代亞·普賴斯
Obadiah Price.

32
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,007
是，我是答應你了
Yes. I did make you
a promise.

33
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,458
等等，感覺不太對
BORIS:
Wait. I smell something.

34
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,194
- 你無路可逃，鮑裏斯
- 是麼
GUARD: You can't win, Boris.
BORIS: Mm.

35
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,167
咱們走著瞧
Let's agree to disagree.

36
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,273
我們人數多
There's too many of us.

37
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,173
這裏太熱了，介意開窗通風嗎？
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?

38
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,097
對不起，親愛的，蛋糕確實不錯
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.

39
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,387
讓我們重寫歷史，好嗎，K探員？
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

40
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,047
下午好
Good afternoon.

41
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,912
請大家注意看我的搭檔，J探員
Please give your attention
to my associate, Agent J.

42
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,713
他會給大家示範一下
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-biomechanical,

43
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,516
電子生物神經傳送零復位裝置
neural-transmitting,
zero-synapse repositioner.

44
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,885
我們叫它記憶消除器
We call it the neuralyzer.

45
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,357
- 簡單點，滑頭
- 多謝
Keep it simple, slick.
Thanks a lot.

46
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,357
感謝J探員
Thank you, Agent K.

47
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,088
女士們，先生們，如果你們看這裏
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look right here.

48
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,866
就會知道你們是如何登上飛機的
並且空姐讓你們關手機
You know how you're on a plane and
you're asked to turn your phone off?

49
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:37,235
你們卻想「為什麼要關，也沒破壞飛機」
You're like, 'I ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane.'.

50
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,809
看見沒，結果就是這樣
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.

51
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,209
飛機竄到衛星那兒把它轟了下來！
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites and blam!

52
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,780
關掉手機不就沒這事了
Just turm your damn phone off.

53
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,248
今晚你們開車要掉下懸崖了
因為沒GPS信號
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff
tonight because your GPS don't work.

54
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,453
查查燃料和表層堆積物的成分
Check the composition of the
fuel units and surface deposits.

55
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,989
我想知道誰在駕駛
I wanna know who was driving.

56
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,591
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

57
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,955
今晚想說什麼？
別擔心
What are you gonna say tonight?
Ah, don't worry.

58
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,960
能不擔心嗎，這很重要
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.

59
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,827
- 我餓了，你呢？
I'm hungry. You hungry?
K.
- K

60
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,663
說真的，我不認為那是肉
J: Seriously, I'm not
even sure that's meat.

61
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,170
我想我看到了裏面有
牙齒、爪子、蹄子什麼的
I think I just saw a tooth in
that thing, or a claw, or a hoof.

62
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,830
謝謝，曼尼
Thanks, Manny.

63
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,500
這根本不是皮塔餅（希臘小吃類似肉夾饃）
應該是棺材餅
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket.

64
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,906
能不能少說兩句
What would go good with this
would be silence.

65
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,240
看吶，這就是問題所在
See, here's the problem.

66
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,575
你聞不到
You can't smell it

67
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,810
因為你鼻子不好使，我的卻不一樣
because your nose already
smells like that, but my nose doesn't.

68
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:26,013
沉默是金，你應該試著慢點說話
Silence goes good with lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?

69
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,852
煩我就直說，別等回車裏鬱悶
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.

70
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,426
吃完再說
Let me enjoy this.

71
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,187
那就吃吧
Whoa, enjoyment. Ha, ha.

72
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,764
看你表情就知道，我喜歡這情緒
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

73
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,129
情緒和這無關
I keep emotion out of it.

74
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,797
和什麼無關，生活嗎？
Out of what, K? Life?

75
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,607
你就不想讓我幫你一把？
You don't wanna run it by me?

76
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,710
- 讓我看看你想說什麼？
- 別擔心
Let me know what you'll say?
Don't worry.

77
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,312
喔，不，我擔心，非常擔心
Oh, no, I'm worried.
Very worried.

78
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,881
這可是悼詞，你必須要富有情感
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.

79
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,616
才能讓人們感動
That thing people do when they
change their facial expression?

80
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,855
我和澤德共事40年了，他很出色
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.

81
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,958
為了他我會寫下出色的悼詞
And I have written
a hell of a speech for him.

82
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,525
大家會感動的
People will be moved.

83
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,556
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

84
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,231
奇異恩典
（《Amazing grace》）
ALIENS:
Amazing grace

85
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,375
惶惑而今
Was blind but now

86
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,570
得見
I see

87
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,514
現在由K探員獻上幾句
MAN:
And now a few words from Agent K.

88
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,918
我和澤德共事40年
I worked with Zed for over 40 years,
and in all that time

89
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,714
他從來不邀請我吃晚餐
he never invited me to dinner.

90
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,651
也從來沒邀請過我去他家看球賽
He never asked me to his house
to watch a game.

91
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,895
從來不分享他個人生活的任何事
He never shared a single detail
of his personal life.

92
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,327
是啊，他很古怪
Yeah, he was weird.

93
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,736
謝謝
Thank you.

94
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,939
現在由新上任的領導O探員發言
MAN: And now we will hear
from our new chief, Agent O.

95
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,410
謝謝K探員，太感人了
O: Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.

96
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,709
- 這就是你的悼詞？
- 他是個好人
That was your eulogy?
He was a good man.

97
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,012
女士們，先生們及外星朋友們
O: Ladies, gentlemen,
other life forms.

98
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,186
當我把澤德去世的消息告訴
一位齊格羅星人時
When I told the Finucian Zyglot
about Zed's passing,

99
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,587
她說了一些話，接下來我會重複一遍
she said something
that I'm going to repeat.

100
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,823
並釋義
And I'm paraphrasing.

101
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,443
這就是澤德
That's just so Zed.

102
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,646
謝謝
Thank you.

103
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,916
（《I』m An Old Cowhand》）

104
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,989
呀喝！
Yippee-yi-yo-ki-yay

105
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,564
呀喝！我是個老牛仔
Yippee-yi-yo-ki-yay
I'm an old cowhand

106
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,328
有什麼不對勁嗎？老兄
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

107
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,099
你能對我保證嗎，如果我先死了
你在葬禮上的悼詞一定要比這次好？
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll
do better than that at my funeral?

108
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,300
比如：
You know, something like, uh..

109
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,342
J是我的朋友
J was a friend.

110
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,504
對我如此重要的人卻離我而去
Now there's a big part of me
that's gone.

111
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,015
噢，J，有些事還沒來得及告訴你
Oh, J, all the things
that I should have said,

112
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,450
我是個老頭
except I was too old

113
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,419
脾氣壞，傲慢
and craggy and surly

114
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,854
並且頑固
and just tight. I was too

115
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,584
很頑固
tight.

116
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,663
我很想念你性感黝黑的皮膚
I'm gonna just miss
your caramel-brown skin.'

117
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,527
我會現場發揮的
I'll wing something.

118
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,636
K，我是O，我們接到報案
<i>K, it's O.
We have reports of several humans suffering from</i>

119
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,536
有人類感染了外星蛔蟲
<i>intestinal worms of alien origin.</i>

120
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,767
謝謝,O
Thank you, O.

121
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,108
你怎麼變成這樣了？
How did you get to be like you?

122
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,043
出什麼事了，K，發生什麼了？
Something happened, K.
What happened?

123
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,313
你知道我沒什麼不開心的
You know how I live
such a happy life?

124
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,343
沒什麼不開心的？
How you live such a happy life?

125
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,453
我不該知道的從來不問
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.

126
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,057
真深奧
Mm-mm. That's deep.

127
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,989
當一切已注定
And that's when it happens

128
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,220
當你和媽媽一起生活
When you live with your mother

129
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,864
帶她回家，媽媽會說「嗯哼」
Try to take her home
And Mom goes 'Mm-mm'

130

131

Do I know you?

00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:10,011
你很有能力，你父親奧巴代亞告訴我的
Your services are legendary,
so said your father, Obadiah.

133
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,844
你應該在月球監獄
You were in Lunar-Max.

134
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,577
沒有我逃不出的監獄
There is no prison that can hold me.

135
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,156
額…真不賴，你想要什麼，夥計？
Uh... Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?

136
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,585
那個裝置
The device.

137
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:25,361
我要盡快回到過去殺個人
在他奪走我手臂之前
I'm going back in time
to kill a man before he takes my arm.

138
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,774
噢，K探員，J探員！
Oh, K, J!

139
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,540
見到你們很高興，這邊請
So happy to see you.
Uh, Mr. Wu get you your regular table?

140
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,115
不餓嗎？
You no hungry?

141
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,385
給我們看看水箱
Show us the tanks, Wu.

142
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,787
當然，當然可以，你看看，很新鮮
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.

143
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,726
讓我們看看後廚的水箱
Show us the tanks in the back.

144
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,198
抱歉，聽不懂你們說的，晚點再來，好嗎？
Ha, ha. So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?

145
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,633
把這些屁話留給外地人吧
Save the chop-socky bullshit
for the tourists, Wu.

146
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,403
你們到底想幹什麼？
Hey, what you
guys wanna bust my balls for, huh?

147
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,106
你沒權知道
You don't have no balls.

148
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,243
喔
Ooh.

149
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,317
夥計，看起來你來自行星
Man, you look like
you come from the planet.

150
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,577
該死
Damn.

151
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,617
鮑勃明顯違反了第32條衛生條例
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32:

152
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,158
販賣未經許可的外星
Selling unlicensed extraterrestrial...

153
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,756
食品
foodstuffs.

154
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,330
那是地球上的魚類
That is an Earth fish.

155
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,997
這在中國很常見，你要逮捕我的話
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me,

156
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,227
就是種族歧視！
that's a hate crime!

157
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,392
是啊
It would be

158
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,129
如果你是中國人的話
if you were Chinese.

159
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,737
K，拜託，我還要撫養幼蟲
K, come on.
I got larvae to feed.

160
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,077
這尖刺魚是為誰準備的？
Who is the Spiky Bulba fol?

161
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,144
沒有誰
Nobody.

162
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,302
為誰準備的？
K:Who's it for?

163
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,470
我養著它而已！
I keep them in case!

164
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,014
- 說不說？
- 我不知道
In case what?
I don't know!

165
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,116
任何人！
Anybody!

166
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,581
好吧，你個臭蟲
K:
All right, you slug.

167
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,349
喔，喔，額...
Whoa, whoa. Uh...

168
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,653
吳
Wu,

169
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,419
我和他之間有點問題，但不應該拿你出氣
uh, he and I are having issues right now,
but you shouldn't suffer for that.

170
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,287
謝謝，J
Thank you, J.

171
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,590
如果不想被魚扇耳光，得遵守協議
So if you don't like getting
fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.

172
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,359
地球人吃地球魚，真正的地球魚類
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.

173
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,969
為了我這個可憐的人和沒用的孩子
請您留下來吧
On behalf of my pathetic self
and worthless children,you stay.

174
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,664
能夠獻上您最喜歡的麵條我不勝榮幸
好嗎,K？
Allow me most honorable benefit
of serving you favourite noodles, K?

175
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,707
沒人想吃你那噁心的麵條
Don't nobody want
your nasty-ass noodles.

176
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,606
你就是一坨屎，吳
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

177
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,945
放點蝦和白菜一起做
Shrimp and bok choy.

178
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,648
咱倆還得在這呆會
We're gonna be here
for a while.

179
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,121
真是的
J:
That was just mean.

180
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,692
你在後廚都幹了些什麼
What you did to Wu back there.

181
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,697
扒掉他的圍裙
Snatched his skirt off.

182
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,862
這太無禮了
That's just disrespectful.

183
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,869
以前我常和我爸玩個遊戲
I used to play a game
with my dad:

184
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,739
你的最後一餐會吃什麼
What'll You Have
For Your Last Meal.

185
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,378
你可以做得比這更糟
You could do worse than this.

186
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,884
噢，好吧，額…
On. Okay. Um...

187
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,819
我和老爸玩的遊戲
I played a game with my dad

188
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,011
叫做「接球」
called catch.

189
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,680
我把球扔出去，它只會打到牆上
Except I'd throw the ball
and it'd just hit the wall

190
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,190
因為我沒父親
because he wasn't there.

191
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,218
別說你老子壞話
Don't badmouth your old man.

192
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,032
不是說他壞話
我只是真的不知道他是什麼樣
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.

193
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,722
這不對
It's not right.

194
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,926
什麼對不對的，孩子需要父親
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.

195
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,331
一號桌還沒點餐
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three

196
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,234
三號桌已經喝四杯
just drank his fourth cup

197
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,738
鴨醬了
of duck sauce.

198
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,107
K，今天墜落的飛船
<i>O:
K, the crashed ship</i>

199
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,010
是從
<i>from this morning
was stolen from...</i>

200
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:32,842
月球監獄
K:
Lunar-Max.

201
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:33,949
禽獸鮑裏斯
Boris the Animal.

202
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,174
你怎麼知道？
How did you know?

203
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,786
他一向愛吃尖刺魚
He has a taste for Spiky Bulba.

204
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,516
給我們點時間，長官
<i>Give us a minute, chief.</i>

205
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,382
有麻煩了
We're in a situation.

206
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,286
是啊
K:
Oh, yeah.

207
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,518
我對付Chloropod
I take the Chloropod.

208
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,789
你對付Tarantabee
You take the Tarantabee

209
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,432
和那邊的Hydronian
and the Hydronian over there.

210
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,690
然後我會搞定廚房裏的
I'll take the kitchen.

211
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,460
到街上會合
Meet you on the street.

212
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,427
在我一生中
This is a very confusing time

213
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,901
這可真夠亂套的
in my life.

214
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:16,684
嘿
Unh!
Hey.

215
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,664
噓，噓！
Shh, shh!

216
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,901
嘴閉上，頭低下
Keep your mouth closed,
keep your head down.

217
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,535
嘿呀！
Hi-yah!

218
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,087
惡！
Ugh!

219
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,560
哈嘍，K
Hello, K.

220
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,835
禽獸鮑裏斯
Boris the Animal.

221
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,566
是「鮑裏斯」
It's just Boris.

222
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,835
你沒怎麼變，還是一條胳膊
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

223
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,410
是啊，我的胳膊
Yes, my arm.

224
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,008
在過去的40年中
We've thought about that moment

225
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,718
我無時無刻不在回想斷臂的瞬間
every day for the last 40 years.

226
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,913
你這輩子也就這樣了
Well, that's just not living a full life.

227
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,786
我敢保證我會活得比你長
I can promise you
it will be longer than yours.

228
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,690
如果你是最後一個伯格羅多星人
一樣會感到孤獨
Lonelier too. Since you're
the last Boglodite standing.

229
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,692
走著瞧
We'll see about that.

230
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,596
但是首先，很高興可以親手殺了你
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.

231
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,895
唷，K
Yo, K.

232
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,729
- 你跑哪去了？
- 捕魚
Where the hell have you been?
Fishing.

233
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,990
你還不知道，K，其實你已經死了
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

234
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,096
你沒事吧？
You all right?

235
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,513
請大家往我這邊看好嗎？
May I have everyone's attention,
please?

236
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,750
謝謝
Thank you.

237
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,981
你們知道孩子從集市弄了一袋金魚
You know how your kid won
the goldfish in that little baggie

238
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,752
你們不想在家養它
from the fair and you didn't
want it in your house

239
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,362
所以就騙孩子說金魚跑了
然後就你們以為把它衝進馬桶便沒事了？
so you told your kid it ran away
when you flushed it down the toilet?

240
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,021
好吧，這就是你們幹的
Well, this is what happens.

241
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,430
如何？看到了嗎？別對孩子撒謊
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie in your kids.

242
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,302
夥計，這些事我可干夠了
Man, I am getting too old
for this.

243
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,810
可以想像你是什麼感覺
I can only imagine how you feel.

244
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,040
禽獸鮑裏斯
Boris the Animal.

245
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,617
很久前我把它送到監獄
這是我犯過的最大錯誤
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

246
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,854
為什麼？他是無辜的嗎？
Why? Was he innocent?

247
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,953
應該殺了他
Should have killed him.

248
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,121
- 該死，咱們去幹掉他吧
- 不
Well, shit, let's go get him.
No.

249
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,052
- 不？
- 別管他
No?
Leave it alone.

250
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,458
這不是你的職責
It's above your pay grade.

251
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,360
咱倆職責一樣
We have the same pay grade.

252
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,464
這與你無關，管好自己就行了
It has nothing to do with you
Mind your own business.

253
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,572
好吧，首先，別總對我說教
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit
of that bass out your voice.

254
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,302
其次，只要那禽獸胡作非為，我就得管
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is
running around, this is my business.

255
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,844
如果你管這事我就向上級匯報
You forget about Boris
or my report will reflect

256
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,004
你行為不端
that your conduct
has been unbecoming.

257
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,508
好啊，也許我也可以對你這麼做，K
Well, maybe my report
is gonna reflect some shit too, K.

258
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,177
- 你被停職兩周
- 胡說
You are suspended for two weeks.
Bullshit.

259
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,323
四周
Four weeks.

260
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,558
我退出怎麼樣？
How about I quit?

261
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,990
有些事你沒必要知道
K: There are things out there
you don't need to know.

262
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,188
你雇我時可不是這麼說的
That's not the lie you told me
when you recruited me.

263
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,168
還好嗎，大爺
What up. Pops?

264

329
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,851
對不起，那是巧克力牛奶嗎？
I'm sorry, is that chocolate milk?

330
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,890
我能…？對不起，我不知道怎麼了…
Can I-? I'm so sorry.
I don't know what...

331
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,887
媽咪，奧巴馬搶我的
GIRL:
Mommy, the president is drinking

332
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,998

my milk.
Mmm.

333

對不起
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,999
他還沒問我同不同意呢
He didn't say please.

335

Thank God for that 10-hour stakeout
Who are you?

340
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,903
沒錯，今天我覺得自己煥然一新
Exactly. I feel like
a whole new man today.

341
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,877
進步很快，之前總是對身邊的一切感到不滿
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life,

342
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,607
但現在只對自己和繼母不滿
but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my stepmom.

343
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,774
先生，別說了好嗎
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

344
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,251
這就像我關閉了情感之窗
It's like I closed
this emotional window.

345
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,447
但又打破了它
But I threw a brick
through that window.

346
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,489
多謝你的引導，J
Thank you for handing me
that brick, J.

347
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:26,356
不管你是誰，離我遠點
否則我扯下你的喉嚨
Whoever you are, give me five feet
or I'll pluck you in your throat.

348
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,464
好吧，我得去黑衣人那了
I'm gonna go
to the little Men's-in-Black room,

349
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:34,160
然後去找博伊希拉星球的蠢貨
午飯我請

Uh, I need you to go get me some
chocolate milk, all right?

353
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,077

Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?

354
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,775
他請病假了還是怎麼了？
Did he call in sick
or anything?

355
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,420
誰是K？
Who's K?

356
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,823
好吧，好吧，跟我扯吧
All right, allright,

357
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,754
K！你在哪？
K!

358
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,153
好吧
All right.

359
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,827
你贏了
You got me.

360
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,261
不得不說，很有趣，煞費苦心啊
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.

361

你們大家，演得真不錯
Oh, and all of you,

362
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,465

You waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humor,

363
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,334
這個很不錯
but this is a good one.

364
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,338
K，現在你得出來了
But, K, I need you
to come out here now

365
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,943
因為我已經有點不太高興了
because I'm starting
to get a little pissed off.

366
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,376
J探員，介意小點聲說話嗎
Agent J, would you mind
keeping your voice down

367
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,446
你想找誰？
and telling me
who you're looking for?

368
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:20,708
我在找K
I'm looking for K.

369
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,550
誰是K？
Who is K?

370
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,015
你也給我扯？扯吧
Unh! You too? You too.

371
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,157
我是問，他到底誰是？
I mean, who is he to you?

372
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,451

也許111了

375
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,457
有點傲慢，像貓王一樣，他是這麼笑的
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening
with him. He smiles like this.

376
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,732
看見過嗎？
Seen him around?

377
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,730
我帶你去見他

378
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,738
謝謝
Thank you.

379
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,551

- 是K
What is that supposed to be?
That's K.

380
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,812
他已經去世40多年了
He's been dead for over 40 years.

381
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,386
好吧，看得出來
如果這是笑話的話確實很有趣
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke
is that it be funny.

382
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,324
沒開玩笑
It's never been funny.

- 才不是
You are imagining.
I'm not.

394
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,396
- 我需要心理醫生到這來
- 好的，女士
I need a psych team up here.
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,398
他用Aqua Velva須後水，這不是想像
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.

396
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,096
每次監視行動，連續幾小時都是牛仔音樂
Every stakeout,
endless hours of cowboy music.

397
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,207
每天早上喝咖啡，他總是說
Every morning with his coffee,
he'd say:

398
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,105
「我告訴你，滑頭
這咖啡味道可不怎麼樣」
"I tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt."

399
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,473
然後我說「什麼樣才和你口味？
And I was supposed
to say, 'What do you expect?

400
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,444
這可是早上現磨的咖啡」
It was ground this morning.'
'This morning.'.

401
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,306
你怎麼知道的？
How do you know that?

402
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,881
巧克力牛奶，先生？
Chocolate milk, sir?

403
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,545
你去哪了，夥計？
這都一小時了
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.

404
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:08,887
等下
O:
Wait.

405
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,926
你喜歡巧克力乳製品多久了？
How long have you been craving
chocolatized dairy products?

406
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,460
今天才開始
J:
Just today.

407
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,256
有頭痛，頭暈
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?

408
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,923
- 失去平衡
- 嗯哼
Loss of balance?
Mm-hm.

409
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,591
煩躁，抑鬱的感覺嗎？
Agitation? Depression?

410
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:20,928
是啊，有
Hell, yeah.

411
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,666
兩種可能，一種是你被
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten

412
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,331
哈瓦星球的腦蜱蟲咬了
by a Hovartian brain tick

413
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,977
隨時都可能痛苦掙扎的死去
and could die in horrible agony
at any moment.

414
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,412
該死，不是蜱蟲
Damn it. It's not the tick.

415
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,517
該死，不是蜱蟲？
'Damn it, it's not the tick'?

416
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,346
比蜱蟲還糟？
It's something worse than the tick?

417
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,114
嗯
Mm.

418
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,017
你對巧克力牛奶的癡迷表明
Your obsession
with chocolate milk indicates

419
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,786
你可能參與過某個短時間的時空穿梭
that you might be involved
in some sort of temporal fracture.

420
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,792
我不明白你在說什麼
I don't know
what you're talking about.

421
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,363
巧克力牛奶可以去除因時空穿梭導致的頭痛
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal-fracture headaches.

422
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,197
時空穿梭是什麼？
What's a temporal fracture?

423
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,357
穿越到任意時間點
A break in the timeline.

424
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,501
還是不明白你的意思
Don't know what you mean.

425
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,501
時間旅行！時間旅行
Time travel! Time travel.

426
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,871
根本不存在時間旅行
There's no such thing
as time travel.

427
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,708
- 這個可以有
- 這個真沒有
Well, there is.
No.

428
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:00,968
沒有
There's not.

429
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,577
因為如果有的話
Because if there were

430
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,713
像我這類頂級探員
class-one senior agent
such myself

431
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,441
應該有權知道，難道他不是嗎？
would have been aware of it,
wouldn't he have?

432
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,143
這根本不是機密，只是他越權辦事
Were it not classified
and way above his pay grade.

433
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,515
你知道我想要什麼
You know, I need a raise.

434
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,288
有個卑鄙的傢伙
奧巴代亞·普賴斯
There was one man, scumbag,
Obadiah Price,

435
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,485
他發明的，我們開除了他
穿越宇宙這技術對我們來說是違法的
he figured it out, we busted him,
we made time travel illegal

436
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,194
他被判終生監禁在月球監獄
throughout the universe
and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.

437
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,128
鮑裏斯也關在那
No- That's where Boris
was locked up.

438
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,367
如果鮑裏斯知道如何穿越時空
Uh- If Boris worked out
how to time jump,

439
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,236
他一定會改寫歷史
he could seriously change
the course of history.

440
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,643
注意，預警系統顯示
COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Attention.
Early-warning system engaged.

441
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,743
敵方戰艦已進入太陽系
Inbound hostile warships
entering solar system.

442
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,975
檢測到伯格羅多種族信息
Boglodite markings
and language detected.

443
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,587
伯格羅多，鮑裏斯是伯格羅多星人
但他們已經滅絕了
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite,
but they're extinct.

444
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,051
顯然沒有
Apparently not.

445
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,193
地球即將遭受災難性打擊
Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.

446
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,056
啟用天穹網
Put up the Arc Net.

447
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,921
- 什麼？
- 天穹網，防禦系統
The what?
The Arc Net. The defense system.

448
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,757
K發明的，為了防止伯格羅多星人入侵
K got it for the Boglodites.

449
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,524
K早就不在了
There is no K.

450
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,001
他已經去世40多年了
He's been dead for over 40 years.

451
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,767
他不在就沒有防禦系統
No K. No defense system

452
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,700
鮑裏斯回到過去殺了他
Boris jumped back and killed him.

453
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,779
如果你想拯救世界，從一開始就要阻止他
If you wanna save the world,
stop that from happening.

454
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,648
你去找傑弗裏·普賴斯
他是奧巴代亞的兒子
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.

455
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,283
希望這小子能幫上忙
Let's hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

456
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:23,350
- 祝你好運，J！
- 這是地球的臨別祝詞，哈哈哈
ALIEN 1: Good luck, J!
ALIEN 2: This planet's toast. Ha-ha-ha.

457
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,642
需要點什麼？我這電池
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale

458
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,470
賣的很不錯
on batteries.

459
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,273
哇哦，好吧，我還有別的東西
耳機，充電器什麼的
Whoa. Okay, we got other stuff,
like headphones, adapters or...

460
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,411
你幫助禽獸鮑裏斯時空穿梭
You helped Boris the Animal
time jump.

461
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,652
是，我必須得做，那傢伙是個怪物
Whoa, whoa.
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.

462
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:50,808
他殺了我搭檔
He killed my partner.

463
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,387
我想知道他傳送的時間地點
I want to know when
and where you sent him.

464
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,888
我會告訴你全記在本子裏了嗎？
What, you think I keep,
like, a logbook?

465
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,755
哈
Huh.

466
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,464
目標方位，1969年7月16日
J:
Target vector, July 16,

467
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,567
好吧
1969.
All right.

468
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,464
你朋友真是個無賴
That's a real bummer
about your buddy.

469
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,104
我知道他很棒
I'm sure he was a great guy.

470
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,297
但根據時間連續體來說
But in terms of
the space-time continuum,

471
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,102
你朋友在歷史上簡直不值一提
your friend was a little blip
on the historical radar!

472
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:18,711
哦
Oh.

473
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,950
出大麻煩了
That's a big blip.

474
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,149
- 好吧，我該怎麼辦？
- 你把我送回
Okay. What's the plan?
You're gonna send me

475
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,255
1969年7月15日
back to July 15th, 1969.

476
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,187
不，這不對，因為我把鮑裏斯送到7月16日
No, that's a stupid plan,
because I sent Boris to July 16th.

477
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,260
這不是我擔心的
我要在鮑裏斯現身前
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris

478
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,862
殺了年輕時的他
before the older one shows.

479
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,498
那樣的話，他們兩個都得消失
That way, neither of them
will even exist.

480
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,498
這就是你為什麼穿黑制服
That's why you get to wear
the black suit.

481
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:40,929
不是嗎？
No?

482
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,197
咱倆不撞一下嗎？好吧
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.

483
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,864
喔，我想起來了
Oh, I just thought of something
Even back then,

484
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,135
那年代紐約又大又亂
New York was like a big-ish city.

485
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,210
你打算怎麼找到他？
So how are you
gonna really find him?

486
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,839
7月15日，鮑裏斯在康尼島殺了一名
叫做預言家羅曼的外星人
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney Island.

487
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,179
你準備先到那等他出現？
You're gonna get there first
and be waiting?

488
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,481
夥計，他們應該給你兩套黑制服
Dude, they should give you
two black suits.

489
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,884
老弟，能認真點嗎？
My man, for real?

490
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:01,950
好吧
On, right.

491
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,353
對不起
Sorry. Um...

492
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,522
這才是
This...

493
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,128
真傢伙，時空穿梭裝置
is the real deal. Time-jump gear.

494
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,992
非常稀有，有年頭了
Very rare, very old.

495
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,327
但首先，咱們得「嗨」一下
But first, we gotta get high.

496
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,865
嘿，不
Hey. No.

497
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,704
不是，我是說到很高的地方
（high有多重意思）
No. No, I mean, really high.

498
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,589
嘿，夥計，拉我一把？
JEFFREY: Unh! Hey, man?
A little help here?

499
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,659
謝謝
Unh. Thank you.

500
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,699
好的
Okay...

501
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,863
- 知道時空穿梭的規則嗎？
- 長話短說
You know the rules of time jumps?
Give me the short version.

502
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,839
想救你搭檔，建議：
Okay. You wanna save
your partner, word of advice:

503
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,534
離他遠點
Shy away from him.

504
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,203
記住了嗎，離K遠點，殺了鮑裏斯就行
Yeah, got it. Slay away from K.
Just kill Boris.

505
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,212
現在，拿上這個
Now, take these.

506
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,112
掉下去時會獲得足夠的風速
It gets pretty windy
on the way down.

507
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,512
掉下去？
The way down?

508
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,019
如果你哭的話，就看不到刻度盤了
With eyes tearing up,
it's hard to read the dial.

509
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,591
再說，他使你看起來更像時間旅行者
這酷斃了
Plus, it helps you look like a real
time traveler, which is cool.

510
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,853
我才不要從這跳下去！
I am not jumping off of this building!

511
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,894
不跳就沒戲
Time jump...

512
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,928
好了，現在
Okay, now,

513
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,897
我設置一下
I gotta set this thing

514
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,627
到15日
to the 15th.

515
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,871
好像
（1969年7月15日上午10:29）
Uh, that seems

516
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,029
沒錯
right-ish.

517
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,068
現在
Now

518
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,711
就差你一跳了
all you gotta do is jump.

519
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,279
嘿，別，別拍我
Hey. Hey. Slop. Sup it.

520
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,144
當你下落速度足夠快時
When you're moving fast enough,

521
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,876
圓圈內會充滿綠色液體
that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green time-travel liquid

522
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,783
發出奪目的亮光
and it's gonna glow
really bright.

523
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,584
然後你盡快用拇指劃過藍色激光線
As soon as that happens,
break that blue laser line

524
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,727
來完成這次旅行
with your thumb
to complete the circuit.

525
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,919
這個高度，應該是…
At this height,
that should be, uh...

526
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,998
我算算，地球質量和每分鐘30英尺左右
Let's see, mass of Earth and
30-something feet per minute...

527
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,634
每秒32英尺，每秒！
It's 32 feet per second, per second!

528
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,770
你說得對
That sounds right-ish.

529
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,272
我想應該是…，大約離地面兩英尺
So that would be, I guess, uh,
about two feet off the ground.

530
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,738
劃過激光線嗎？
I break the laser line?

531
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,899
不，別碰它！
No, don't break it!

532
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,012
- 那什麼時候才算快！
- 聽起來不錯
No, when I'm fast enough!
Sounds good!

533
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,115
劃過激光線到底有沒有用？
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?

534
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,273
別把這設備弄丟了
Do not lose that time device

535
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,411
否則你就得一直呆在1969年了！
or you will be stuck in 1969!

536
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,422
對你來說可不是什麼好時候
It wasn't the best time
for your people.

537
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,619
只是說說，讓你冷靜一下
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.

538
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,321
我怎麼知道這是否有用？
How will I know if it works?

539
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,330
非生
You'll either

540
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,825
即死
or you won't.

541
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,205
你一定很喜歡這傢伙才會這麼做
You must really love this guy
to do this.

542
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,437
等等，為什麼只有我記得K？
其他人都忘了
Oh, wait. How come I remember K,
but nobody else does?

543
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,447
哇哦！
Whoa! Whoa.

544
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,177
- 那說明當時你在那
- 在哪？
That means you were there!
I was where?

545
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,321
如果你活著回來，一定跟我好好講講
If you survive, you gotta come back
and tell me everything.

546
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,149
在哪？
Where was I?

547
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,815
你得跳了！
You gotta go!

548
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:51,789
快跳，快！
Just go, go, go!

549
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,078
哦，不！
Oh, no!

550
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:35,834
快啊！
Come on!

551
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,591
愛
（《Love Is Strange 》）
Love

552
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,951
愛是陌生的
Love is strange

553
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,625
當你離開我
When you leave me

554
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,769
- 老兄，今天星期幾
- 星期三
My man, what's today?
Tuesday.

555
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,426
- 幾號？
- 15號
The date?
The 15th.

556
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,163
- 哪月？
- 7月
Of?
July.

557
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,467
- 年份呢
- 1969年
Dog, the year.
1969.

558
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,268
謝謝
Thank you.

559
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,873
我不會以為我瘋了吧
Look at me like I'm crazy.

560
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,356
太棒了
MAN 1:
Far out.

561
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,993
你不會相信的
傑瑞在嬉皮士的地盤嗨翻了
Jerry rocked Haight-Ashbury
like you wouldn't believe.

562
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,303
好的，我們到了
MAN:
Okay, we're here.

563
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,995
- 高興嗎？
- 你真令人討厭，佛瑞德
Happy'?
WOMAN: You're such a pill, Fred.

564
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,676
- 去辦入住手續
- 知道了
FRED: Get us checked in.
WOMAN: Yeah, yeah.

565
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,538
嘿，幫個忙，好嗎？
Hey. Hey, do me a favour, all right?

566
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,910
- 拿行李時小心點
- 一定會的，先生
Be careful with the luggage.
Absolutely, sir.

567
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,250
這行李箱貴著呢
FRED: I paid a lot of
money for that luggage.

568
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,979
- 我們會照看好的
- 還有別磨壞了
BELLBOY: We'll take good care-
FRED: Last time, it got scuffed up.

569
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,622
給你，先生
如果需要服務就叫我
Here you go, sir.
Just call down when you need it.

570
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,224
後備箱還有行李
There's more in the trunk.

571
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,524
知道了，會安排妥當的，先生。請進去吧
Uh, yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.

572
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,564
對不起，打擾一下，那是誰？
BELLBOY: Excuse me.
Excuse me, who is that?

573
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,633
你是誰？
Who are you?

574
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,862
14號航班，你現在
（《2000 Light Years From Home》）
Bell Flight 14, you now

575
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,665
可以著陸
Can land

576
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:27,932
快走啊！
Let's go!

577
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,372
綠色沙地是你的藏身之所
Safe on the green desert sand

578
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,010
不過這裏渺無人煙
It's so very lonely

579
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,358
離開家鄉
You're 2000 light-years

580
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,423
2000光年
From home

581
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,960
不錯啊，夥計！
Far out, man!

582
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,893
如果你再這樣我就不客氣了
If you want to keep that,
I wouldn't.

583
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,658
笑一個別生氣
Make love, not war.

584
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,194
不用你告訴我該怎麼做
I prefer to do both

585
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,932
警官，你好嗎？
我能為你做點什麼？
How are you, officers?
What can I do you fol?

586
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,203
看吶，電動車窗和密封條
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seals

587
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,475
我打賭這車得6千美元
I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
Yeah.

588
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,981
是啊，這車還有個隱藏式頂棚
Uh, yes, and it has a roof,
but it's hidden.

589
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,012
嘿，你是做什麼的？
Hey, what kind of work
do you do?

590
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,481
像你這種膚色的人
An individual of your

591
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,590
能買得起這種車嗎？
particular ethnic persuasion?

592
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,616
- 嗯
- 沒準是個有名的運動員
Mm...
COP: Maybe he's a noted athlete.

593
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,817
嗯
Mm.

594
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:58,097
是啊，我是底特律黑人隊的前鋒
Yes. Uh... Starling forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

595
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,493
車和制服哪來的？
Where'd you get the car?
And the suit?

596
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,364
從你們那偷的，車是你老婆的
I stole them both.
Uh, car from your wife,

597
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,370
制服是你奶奶的
suit from your grandmother.

598
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:07,868
嘿
Hey.

599
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,875
這是什麼？武器嗎？
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?

600
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,775
嘿，這可是他奶奶的制服
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.

601
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,945
- 嘿，這是什麼？
- 可能是毒品
Hey, what's this?
Probably drugs.

602
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,380
在你們按旁邊的按鈕前
I have rights
and I demand to see my lawyer

603
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,487
我有權見我的律師
before you press that small button
on the side firmly.

604
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,314
按一下試試
Press it.

605
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,653
先生們，這就是記憶消除器的功能
That, gentlemen,
is a standard-issue neuralyzer.

606
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,298
你們不會記得了
You're not gonna remember that.

607
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,196
因為當你們看見一個黑人開著豪車
And just because you see
a black man driving a nice car

608
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,667
並不意味著就是偷的
does not mean it's stolen.

609
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,205
這輛是偷的，但不是因為我是黑人
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.

610
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,910
這車我還得用一會
I'll be done
with the car in a minute!

611
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,678
你們找到後還給羅斯福酒店那個蠢貨
Just find it and take it back
to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

612
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,503
阿查南星人在哪？
Where is the Archanan?

613
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,728
你太晚了
MAN:
You are too late.

614
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,566
他已經把天穹網
He is going to give the humans

615
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,400
交給人類了
the Arc Net.

616
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,534
咱們走著瞧
Let's agree to disagree.

617
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,639
這事我們負責
We'll take it from here.

618
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,443
K，是你嗎？
K?

619
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,106
K！真是你
K! K! Aah!

620
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,063
爸，我在地球呢
ALIEN:
Dad, I'm on Earth.

621
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,860
來保釋我
I need bail.

622
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,413
藍色變形飛船的主人
Will the owner
of a blue warp-speed cruiser

623
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,982
請到前台報道
<i>please report to the front desk.</i>

624
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,482
你應該把那該死的東西電量調低點
You need to turn the electricity
down on that damn thing.

625
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,820
我舌頭都麻了，K
Can't taste my fricking tongue, K.

626
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,121
你怎麼知道我名字？
How do you know my name?

627
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,463
什麼？因為我叫你K？
What? Because I called you 'K'?

628
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,760
不，我管每個人都叫K
No, I call everybody K.

629
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,668
我就這樣
It's kind of my thing.

630
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,998
是吧，K？
What up, K?

631
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,466
好吧，有點…
All right, I sort of...

632
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,870
我就是這樣子，只是…
有人喜歡這樣
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just- Uh, some people like it.

633
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,173
很多人
Most people.

634
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,973
現在我知道你撒謊的時候
Now that I know what you look like

635
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,776
是什麼樣了，時候讓我看看
when you're lying, show me

636
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,318
你說實話的樣子吧？
what you look like
when you're telling the truth?

637
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,683
這些是我在康尼島玩套圈贏的
I won those at Coney Island
on the ring toss.

638
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,290
曾經我贏過一隻玩具熊
這些東西倒是沒見過
I won a stuffed bear once,
but never one of these.

639
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,323
你技術一定很不錯，滑頭
Must be good, slick.

640
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,188
好吧，先生，能贏到什麼這是我的事
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.

641
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,526
我在等我朋友，順便說下
I was waiting for my girl,
who, by the way.

642
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,329
我不見了她現在一定擔心得要命
Is probably worried sick
looking for me right now.

643
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,496
所以我得拿回我的東西回去見她
So I just need my things
and I need to get back to her.

644
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,572
她叫什麼？
What's her name?

645
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:26,969
什麼？
Huh?

646
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,439
你女朋友，她叫什麼？
Your gal, what's her name?

647
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,338
史特瑞恩
Schtaron.

648
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,214
史特瑞恩？
Schtaron?

649
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,956
我打賭史特瑞恩就是你的制服，對吧？
I bet Schtaron
likes that suit of yours. Hm?

650
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,757
什麼，穿黑制服犯法嗎？
What, it's a crime
to wear a black suit?

651
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,825
好吧，聽著，我沒做錯什麼
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.

652
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,430
我要離開這，不想和你再談了
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be here with you.

653
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:54,763
非常抱歉，因為康尼島的事X快崩潰了
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney Island incident.

654
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,460
多謝提醒
Thanks for the heads-up.

655
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,838
哦，夥計，這咖啡味道可不怎麼樣
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.

656
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,740
- 什麼樣才和你口味？這可是
- 早上現磨的咖啡
What do you expect? It was-
J: Just ground this morning.

657
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,510
你是O？
O?

658
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,687
不，我稱女士為O
No, I call ladies "O."

659
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,880
對我來說，O是女性，K是男性
To me, O is feminine,
K is masculine.

660
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:19,551
這就好比我喜歡的詞「O-K」
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K."

661
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,095
一團糟，有傷亡報告嗎？
What a mess.
Any casualties?

662
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,197
是的，預言家羅曼
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.

663
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,595
人類有傷亡嗎？
Any human casualties?

664
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,897
沒有，先生
No, sir.

665
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,201
這傢伙是誰？
Who the hell is this?

666
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:32,767
我是…
Look, I was...

667
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,934
- 一個迷路的
- 送到43號房間，沒事就放他走
Stray human caught in the net.
Code 43 him and throw him back.

668
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,205
您該去參加
與維格安星人的會議了
You're late for a meeting
with the Viagrans.

669
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,473
他們發明了一種革命性的新藥物
They have a revolutionary new pill.

670
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:41,809
真的是…
It's really...

671
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,712
好了，滑頭
Okay, slick.

672
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,651
我在等我的女友
I was waiting for my girl.

673
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:49,882
史特瑞恩
Schtaron.

674
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,721
沒錯，希臘人
Yes, she's Greek.

675
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:58,229
好吧，最後一件事，眼科檢查
Okay. Just one last thing.
An eye exam..

676
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,438
這根本不是眼科檢查，K
這是他媽的大號記憶消除器
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyzer!

677
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,771
你看著傻呼呼的，知道的還不少
You have a lot of information for
a fella who doesn't know anything.

678
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,344
我都明白
J:
I see what you're saying.

679
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,845
哇哦，你知道的,K
咱等會行嗎
Whoa. You know, K,
we need to hold up a second.

680
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,243
K！
K!

681
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,779
先戴上牙套
TECHNICIAN:
Let's get this bile guard in here.

682
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,682
滾開，滾開
Hey. Back up. Back up.

683
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,622
K,聽著，咱們不該以這種方式開頭，對嗎？
K, listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, all right?

684
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,125
咱們停下來談談吧
So let's just stop for a second
and talk.

685
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,990
別讓我進去，K！
Don't put me in here, K!

686
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,324
太晚了，種馬
Too late, hoss.

687
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,490
K，不，聽我說
我能幫你擺脫困境！
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!

688
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,800
K！
K!

689
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,333
這次是說真的！看我表情就知道了！
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!

690
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,332
我想像一下就行了
Ah, I'll just use my imagination.

691
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,779
K,你在找的殺手
J:
K, the killer

692
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,643
我也在找他，是伯格羅多星人
you're looking for, I'm after
the same guy. A Boglodite.

693
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,840
他叫鮑裏斯
His name is Boris.

694
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,144
設備已啟動，朋友
Ship has sailed, amigo.

695
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,082
如果咱們抓不到他，就會有兩個他
J:
If we don't get him, there'll be two.

696
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,152
我沒騙你
You had my undivided attention.

697
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,449
一個有一隻胳膊
J:
One will have one arm

698
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,319
一個有兩隻胳膊
and one's gonna have two. Kl.

699
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,824
聽我說！
Listen to me!

700
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,960
如果你毀掉我的記憶
If you erase me.

701
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,357
就等於毀掉世界！
You erase the world!

702
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,230
還有15秒
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Fifteen seconds

703
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,629
執行記憶刪除程序，14秒
to neuralyzation. Fourteen.

704
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,462
13秒，12秒
Thirteen. Twelve.

705
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,539
11秒，10秒，9秒
Eleven. Ten. Nine.

706
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:17,645
當你明天看到鮑裏斯時，殺了他
別抓他，直接殺了他！
When you see Boris tomorrow, K,
kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!

707
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,845
4秒，3秒，2秒
Four. Three. Two.

708
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,254
這東西關了嗎？還沒完全關閉吧？
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!

709
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,750
還在嗡嗡響呢
It's whirring and buzzing.

710
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,894
我是不是什麼都不知道了
I don't know if I don't know nothing

711
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,269
我認識羅曼
I knew Roman.

712
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,335
曾經吃過他妻子做的晚餐
雖然味道不怎麼樣
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant,

713
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:46,997
但他是我朋友
he was my friend.

714
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,171
最後一次機會，你是誰你想幹什麼？
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

715
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,350
我是來自未來的MIB探員
I'm an agent at Men In Black

716
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,110
咱們倆是搭檔
from I'm from the future.
We're partners.

717
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,948
25年後你會雇我
In 25 years, you'll recruit me,

718
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,215
再等14年，今天你阻止我要殺的那傢伙
and 14 years after that,
the guy you didn't let me kill today

719
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,382
從監獄裏逃出來，回到過去
Escapes from prison,
jumps to the past

720
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,224
並且開始時入侵地球
我們還有19小時可以殺了他
and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him,

721
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,366
所以咱們現在就得行動
so, really,
we need to go right now.

722
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:20,768
好吧
All right.

723
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,245
所以你相信我說的故事了
So that's the story you believe.

724
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,440
我相信是真的
That one was the truth.

725
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,711
雖然不一定都是真的
但可以滿足目前需要
Wasn't the whole truth,
but it'll do for now.

726
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,981
你以為呢？當然都是真的
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.

727
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,387
咱們之間唯一的謊言就是你曾經…
The problem with a lie is once
you start lying you put yourself...

728
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,923
K探員
X:
Agent K.

729
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,796
他還在這幹什麼？
What's he still doing here?

730
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,799
我審了他很久，該讓他回去了
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.

731
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,802
咱倆是好基友
I put my pants on.

732
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,002
未來之人，咱去哪？
Okay, future man, where to?

733
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,607
我不知道
I don't know.

734
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,772
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

735
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,821
我不知道，去你最後到的地方？
I don't know. Uh...
Go wherever you went last time.

736
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,424
難道我沒告訴你我要去哪嗎？
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?

737
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,993
沒，我是說，咱倆根本就沒怎麼談過
No. I mean, we don't really talk.

738
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,331
什麼樣的搭檔才能
相處14年都沒怎麼說過話
What kind of partners sit in a car
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

739
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:23,098
沒錯，這就是問題所在
Exactly. And this is the type
of problem it causes.

740
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,295
這可不好
It's dysfunctional.

741
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:28,635
好吧，你最好現在就能證明自己的能力
否則就給我回43號房間裏呆著
All right, sport, you better get useful
real quick or you go back in room 43.

742
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,340
夥計…
Man...

743
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,544
額…
Uh- The, uh...

744
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,649
還有個什麼關於工廠的
There was something in the file
about a factory.

745
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,981
在工廠有事發生
Something happened at a factory.

746
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,825
老兄，你怎麼瞪我都沒用
Hey, look, man, you can put
your Jedi Knight on me all you want.

747
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,257
這就是我知道的
That's all I got.

748
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,660
提醒你什麼了？
That spark something?

749
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:56,531
羅曼死的時候身上帶著這個
Roman had this on his person
when he was murdered.

750
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,697
一個紙板火柴
J:
It's a matchbook.

751
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,773
不，這是線索
No, it's a clue.

752
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,569
他不抽煙
He didn't smoke.

753
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,022
呀喝
（《I』m An Old Cowhand》）
Yippee-yi-yo-ki-yay

754
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,517
呀喝
Yippee-yi-yo-ki-yay

755
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,095
我是個老牛仔
I'm an old cowhand

756
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,196
來自格蘭德河
From the Rio Grande

757
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,665
我在牛仔樂隊中唱著這首歌
And I sing this song
In the cowboy band

758
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,039
我熟知所有牛仔之歌
I know all the songs
That the cowboys know about

759
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,176
有什麼不對勁嗎？老兄
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

760
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,909
沒有
No. Uh...

761
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,604
你多大了？
Hey, man, how old are you?

762
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,838
呀喝！他是個老牛仔
<i> Yippee-yi-yo-ki-yay
He's an old cowhand </i>

763
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,075
29歲
Twenty-nine.

764
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,513
長得夠著急的
Oof. You got some city miles
on you.

765
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,290
貌似我知道為啥咱倆沒話說了
I'm starting to understand
why we don't talk.

766
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,448
（宇宙保齡球館）
what

767
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,894
- 你怎麼知道這地方？
- 名氣大
How well do you know this place?
I know its reputation.

768
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:03,031
我不喜歡盲目做事，我需要我的槍
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.

769
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,434
可以，滑頭
Sure thing, slick.

770
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:08,041
K，等等，別，我得和你一起去！
Whoa, K! Wait, no,
I gotta go in with you!

771
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,972
你別動就好，我去搞定
You sit tight. I'll be fine.

772
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,306
等等，別！別去！
Wait, no! No!

773
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,277
K！
K!

774
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,145
K，別自己去！
K, don't go in by yourself!

775
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,718
嗨，夥計們
Hi, fellas.

776
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,389
見你們老闆
Need to see the boss.

777
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:24,885
他忙著呢
He's busy.

778
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:25,890
哼
Hm.

779
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,086
好吧，那我隨便逛逛
Well, I'm gonna just
lake a look around.

780
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,236
貌似打個平手
Looks like we have ourselves
a standoff.

781
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,373
應該是
Looks that way.

782
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,473
- 還把鑰匙放煙灰缸底下
- 算你走運
Still keep the key under the ashtray.
Lucky guess.

783
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,171
這是什麼地方？
Now, where were we?

784
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,247
把我頭擰下來也不會告訴你們
I was about to tell you
to screw off,

785
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,283
滑頭，保齡球玩的如何？
Hey, slick,
you bowl in the future?

786
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,614
連續3年MIB聯賽冠軍
MiB league champ,
three years running.

787
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,450
好吧，讓我瞧瞧
Well, let's see it.

788
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,654
你不能就這麼大搖大擺的進來
Unh! You did not walk into my.

789
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,623
擰下我的頭！
Establishment
and rip my head off!

790
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,287
夥計，你時日不多了，跟他說實話吧
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.

791
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,126
說個屌！
I'll 'tell him 'this!

792
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,289
好吧，你選的
All right, your head.

793
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:10,461
等等，嘿，如果你這麼干
我不會放過你的
MAN: Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down

794
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,799
肯定讓你
and make sure you

795
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,464
一輩子
walk funny for the rest

796
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,474
吃不了兜著走
of your miserable last days
on Earth! Unh!

797
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,801
- 看你剩這兩個，滑頭
- 上帝！
Tough spare, slick.
God!

798
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,208
你們惹錯人了！
MAN:
You messed with the wrong head!

799
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,541
他頭有點…
His head's a little...
K: You gonna tell us

800
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,207
快說他在哪
where Dom is?

801
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,682
我要殺了你們，你們倆死定了！
MAN: I'll kill you both.
I'll kill both of youse!

802
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,284
- 喔！
- 嗷！
Ooh!
Ow!

803
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,287
球上有汗水太滑了吧
用我幫你清理下嗎？
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?

804
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,051
- 好啊
- 別，別，別
Sure thing.
MAN: No, no, no.

805
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,993
拜託，早上我用這個洗過頭了
Come on, I just cleaned
the bathroom with this thing!

806
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,461
別洗了！別洗了！
No cleaning! No cleaning!

807
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:41,626
行了！行了！夠了，他在後面
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.

808
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,362
但他不會和你這種黑衣人渣談的
But he's not gonna talk
to any Men in Black scum like you.

809
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,201
現在把我頭放回去
Now give me back my head.

810
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:49,743
K，我管這叫「勝利在望」
K, I call this one
'Low Hanging Fruit.'.

811
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,206
這可不是手指孔
MAN:
That ain't a finger hole,

812
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,075
你個王八蛋！嗷！
you sick bastard! Ow!

813
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,408
我會以其人之道
I'll pop your head off

814
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,982
還治其人之身
and see how you like it.

815
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,410
噢！
Ooh!

816
00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,849
我要殺了你們！
MAN: I'm gonna kill both of you!

817
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,314
你們死定了！
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!

818
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,981
我會殺了你們的
I'll kill you both.

819
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,465
咱們來對地方了，就是時機不適合
Well, we're on the right track.
Just the wrong train.

820
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,163
如果他有什麼秘密
K:
If he had any secrets,

821
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,824
估計已經招了
I'm guessing he spilled them.

822
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,368
聰明人會多謀善斷
A smart man figures out
what victims have in common.

823
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,028
沒錯
A smart man would.

824
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,606
那是大哥大嗎
That's a big-ass phone.

825
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:23,023
- 這東西輻射可不小
- O探員
Don't put that up to your head.
Agent O.

826
00:53:23,185 --> 00:53:25,597
今天進展如何，K探員？
How's your day been, Agent K?

827
00:53:25,754 --> 00:53:26,892
馬馬虎虎
Oh, fair to middling.

828
00:53:27,055 --> 00:53:28,056
你怎麼樣？
How are things going?

829
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:29,429
還不錯，謝謝
O:
Very good, thank you.

830
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,365
一小時前你們不見過面嗎
Hey, you saw her
like an hour ago.

831
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:33,733
我在宇宙保齡球館
派人來清理隔離現場
I need cleanup and containment
at Cosmic Lanes.

832
00:53:33,895 --> 00:53:35,841
我這有一個帕萊先星人受害者
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

833
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:38,705
如果沒猜錯的話，羅曼是巴沃爾德星人
Now Roman was a Byvoid,
correct me if I'm wrong,

834
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:42,508
這兩個星球屬同一星系，都是三角星座裏的
from the same planetary grouping?
A system in the Triangulum Galaxy

835
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:43,911
並且都讓伯格羅多星人佔領了
wiped out by Boglodites.

836
00:53:44,072 --> 00:53:45,278
第三個星球呢？
Wasn't the third planet-?

837
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,215
- Glamouria星球？
- Glamouria星球
（真實存在的《魅力》雜誌美國版）
K & J: Glamouria?
Glamouria.

838
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:49,947
謝謝，O小姐
Thank you, Miss O.

839
00:53:51,046 --> 00:53:53,549
我知道鮑裏斯接下來會去哪
I know where Boris
is headed to next.

840
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:58,386
你說得沒錯，滑頭
不過不是工廠，是時尚派對
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.

841
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,228
如果鮑裏斯來著，我會殺了他的
Look, if Boris turns out
to be here, I'm gonna kill him.

842
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:07,931
- 把槍給我
- 沒門
I need my gun.
No deal.

843
00:54:09,865 --> 00:54:11,367
我做了14年探員
I've been an agent
for 14 years.

844
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:15,071
作為高級探員經驗比你豐富
現在我不想擺架子
Which means I'm the senior agent
on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank,

845
00:54:15,237 --> 00:54:17,274
但我必須要求你這個初級探員
but I am instructing
my junior agent,

846
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:20,386
把槍還給我，馬上！這是命令
that's you, to give me my gun
right now. That's an order.

847
00:54:27,315 --> 00:54:28,794
不，不，不，太空槍
No, no, no, space gun.

848
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,395
不客氣
You're welcome.

849
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:32,821
我沒說謝謝
I didn't say thank you.

850
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:41,430
這麼難看的物種，來地球幹什麼
For such an ungainly species,
they've thrived on Earth.

851
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:43,166
當了3年探員
I was an agent for three years

852
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:45,402
才知道所有模特都是外星人
before I realized
all models were aliens.

853
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:47,740
算是歷盡艱險
Found out the hard way.

854
00:54:48,103 --> 00:54:48,843
口令?
Password?

855
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,676
60年代的時髦小伙
咱可沒時間跟你耗著
Hey, look, funky '60s dude,
we don't have a lot of time.

856
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,148
詹尼斯·喬普林
Janis Joplin.

857
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:58,188
當我仰望天空
（《Pictures Of Matchstick Men》）
When I look up to the sky

858
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:00,292
看到你的眼睛
I see your eyes

859
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:01,655
奇異的黃色
A funny kind of yellow

860
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:03,854
這裏全是外星人吧？
ls there anybody here
who's not an alien?

861
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:08,924
跑回家躺在床上
懷疑是否腦子進水了
I rush home to bed
I soak my head

862
00:55:09,224 --> 00:55:10,294
真不錯
Very nice.

863
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:12,097
眨眼，太好了
Blink. That's good.

864
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:13,238
往攝像機這邊看
Look in the camera.

865
00:55:13,528 --> 00:55:15,439
那是安迪·沃霍爾？
（20世紀藝術界知名人士）
Is that Andy Warhol?

866
00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:18,505
是他
Yep.

867
00:55:20,535 --> 00:55:23,778
打擾一下，沃霍爾先生，有時間嗎？
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
could we have a minute?

868
00:55:23,939 --> 00:55:27,148
現在可不是時候，我這忙著呢
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.

869
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:28,484
有幾個
K:
Just a few

870
00:55:28,643 --> 00:55:29,883
問題想問你
questions.

871
00:55:30,045 --> 00:55:33,219
我不會回答的
No questions. No answers.

872
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:35,019
我還有事
Just being.

873
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:37,624
我們有急事要跟你談下
We have an urgent matter
we would like to discuss with you

874
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:39,629
關於這次派對上的一個客人
regarding one
of your party guests.

875
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:42,468
為什麼你們不下周再來
Why don't you come back

876
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:44,626
等事情
next week, after the happening

877
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:46,568
結束的時候
has happened.

878
00:55:47,462 --> 00:55:50,568
抱歉，沃霍爾先生
你語速太慢，時間不等人
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like
talking slow. We got stuff to do.

879
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:51,971
我還得拯救地球呢
I've got a planet to save.

880
00:55:52,868 --> 00:55:54,541
你真無禮
WARHOL:
You're distressing. Everything

881
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:56,705
令我很不舒服
about you upsets me
Unh! Unh!

882
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:02,178
該死，K！你想讓我暴露身份嗎？
Damn it, K! Are
you trying to blow my cover?

883
00:56:02,344 --> 00:56:04,051
W探員，沒事的
Agent W, your cover is safe.

884
00:56:04,346 --> 00:56:06,053
安迪·沃霍爾是自己人？
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?

885
00:56:06,214 --> 00:56:07,056
沒事？
WARHOL:
Safe?

886
00:56:07,215 --> 00:56:09,217
你瘋了嗎？我都沒招了
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas

887
00:56:09,384 --> 00:56:11,591
只能畫畫罐頭和香蕉
I'm painting cans
and bananas for chrissakas.

888
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:14,527
實際上，沃霍爾先生
我得告訴你我喜歡你的工作
Actually, Mr. Warhol, I gotta
tell you, I love your work.

889
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,029
謝謝
Oh. Oh, thank you.

890
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:17,101
那蠢驢是誰？
Who's the dumb-ass?

891
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:20,431
噢，等下，能不能禮貌一點？
Whoa. Hey. How about a little
professional courtesy here?

892
00:56:20,595 --> 00:56:21,903
- 什麼，蠢驢嗎？
- 你敢再說一遍
What, dumb-ass?
Say it again.

893
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:23,235
- 你想聽？
- 我打賭你不敢
Want me to?
I dare you.

894
00:56:23,398 --> 00:56:24,206
蠢驢
Dumb-ass.

895
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:26,039
- 兩位特工
- 和安迪·沃霍爾相比
Agents.
I have no problem

896
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:28,545
你就是一坨屎
pimp-slapping the shiznit
out of Andy Warhol.

897
00:56:29,204 --> 00:56:29,875
什麼？
What?

898
00:56:35,443 --> 00:56:36,717
看我幹什麼？
Why are you looking at me?

899
00:56:39,447 --> 00:56:41,791
好吧，你知道嗎？K探員
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K,

900
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,624
你跟W探員慢慢嘮吧
you see what information
you can get from Agent W

901
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,026
我到外面看看
and I'll go case the perimeter.

902
00:56:47,188 --> 00:56:48,895
- 這樣行了吧？
- 幹你的活去吧
That work for everybody?
Go do that.

903
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:50,536
- 這個如何？
- 小屁孩
How about that?
Oh, cub.

904
00:56:50,692 --> 00:56:52,569
- 滿意了
- 很好
Okay.
Very nice.

905
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,137
某人不覺得自己很幼稚嗎？
Someone forget his nap? Huh?

906
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:58,969
火柴男的海市蜃樓和你
Mirages of matchstick men and you

907
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:02,813
他們永遠在我眼前
<i> All I ever see is them </i>

908
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:05,042
嘿，你好嗎？
Hey, how you doing?

909
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:07,476
不好
Chilling.

910
00:57:07,642 --> 00:57:10,282
你和這傢伙在一起
你的謊言讓他傷心欲絕
You're with this guy
You make men cry, you lie

911
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:13,419
那傢伙是誰？
WARHOL:
Who's that guy?

912
00:57:13,648 --> 00:57:15,321
別告訴我他是你的新搭檔
Don't tell me he's your new partner.

913
00:57:15,483 --> 00:57:19,090
實際上他是我的老搭檔，他來自未來…
Actually, he's my old partner.
He traveled back from the future...

914
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:21,393
停，別說了，我不想知道
Stop, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

915
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:23,331
安迪，洋子來了
WOMAN:
Andy, Yoko's here.

916
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:26,335
洋子來了，額…
Yoko's here. Uh- Ahem.

917
00:57:26,494 --> 00:57:30,806
告訴她我在為這人拍吃漢堡的戲
Tell her that I'm filming
this man eating a hamburger. Um...

918
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:33,573
這棒極了
It's transcendent.

919
00:57:33,902 --> 00:57:36,143
好吧，該換泡菜了
Uh, all right, now the pickle.

920
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:40,676
我在等屬於我的人
I'm waiting for my man

921
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:44,923
你在我地盤幹什麼？
What are you doing on my turf?

922
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:46,656
追蹤一個殺手，伯格羅多星人
Tracking a killer. Boglodite.

923
00:57:46,815 --> 00:57:49,352
我們認為他會來這找一個格羅莫尼亞星人
We believe he's gonna
hit here next, a Glamourian.

924
00:57:49,517 --> 00:57:52,589
格羅莫尼亞？星系沒錯，但星球不對
Glamourian?
Right solar system, wrong planet.

925
00:57:52,754 --> 00:57:54,290
他的目標是Archanan
He's gotta be after the Archanan.

926
00:57:54,456 --> 00:57:55,696
Archanan已經滅絕了
Archanans are extinct.

927
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,803
顯然沒有，上周海灘出現一個
Apparently not.
Ono washed ashore last week.

928
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:02,133
整個羅斯威爾都在議論這事
（著名外星人現身地點）
The whole Roswell circuits
all abuzz about it.

929
00:58:02,464 --> 00:58:04,705
其實他們還有最後一人
Alien unicorn. Last of its species.

930
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:06,445
他叫格裏芬
His name's Griffin Mm.

931
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,437
阿查南星人，格裏芬
WARHOL:
Griffin the Archanan.

932
00:58:08,603 --> 00:58:10,549
我在等屬於我的人
I'm waiting for my man

933
00:58:10,705 --> 00:58:11,775
還好嗎？
How's it going?

934
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,387
還好嗎？這個我說了不算，就我個人來講，還不錯
Going? How's it going? That depends.
For me, personally, things are good.

935
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:17,045
除非一會
Unless we're in the future

936
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:19,556
那肌肉男和他女友吵架
where the muscle boy argues
with his girlfriend.

937
00:58:19,714 --> 00:58:22,627
她氣沖沖離開，恰巧撞到了端蘑菇的人
She storms off and bumps the guy
with the stuffed mushrooms,

938
00:58:22,784 --> 00:58:24,855
托盤倒在水兵身上
who dumps the tray
on the sailors .

939
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,294
一番推搡後
A shoving maths breaks out.

940
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:29,298
水兵撞到了桌子，若是這樣，我得拿走我的盤子
They crash into the table.
In which case, I gotta move my plate.

941
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:36,305
過會我吃完這牛肉三明治
Or it's the future where the
pastrami sandwich I'm eating

942
00:58:36,464 --> 00:58:38,171
會導致胃腸不適
causes me gastric distress.

943
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,973
還好你朋友把右口袋裏的胃藥給了我
Thankfully, your friend offers
the antacids he carries

944
00:58:41,136 --> 00:58:43,980
然後我就好了，沒事了
in his right pocket, so good.
I'll be good.

945
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:47,086
除了一會我必須
Except in the future where
I have to leave in two minutes

946
00:58:47,242 --> 00:58:49,688
在他給我胃藥前離開
before he has a chance
to offer me the antacids,

947
00:58:49,844 --> 00:58:52,848
總的來說，我並不好
so on the whole, I'd have to say
not good. I am not good.

948
00:58:55,016 --> 00:58:56,689
但不是我能決定的
But that depends.

949
00:58:58,753 --> 00:59:00,061
K！快來
K!

950
00:59:00,555 --> 00:59:01,761
我們怎麼才能找到他？
How will we find this guy?

951
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,697
你以為我是什麼，蠢貨嗎？
What am I, schmuck?

952
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:04,863
他在這？
He's here?

953
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:08,064
「在這」只是一個相對概念
他是五維空間的生物
'Here' is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.

954
00:59:08,229 --> 00:59:10,539
他可能在時空的任一點上
They can live in and visualize
an infinite set

955
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:12,906
同時出現
of time-space probabilities
simultaneously.

956
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:15,004
聽起來很厲害，做得好
Sounds like fun. Good work.

957
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,615
等下，K，K，K
Whoa, whoa. K, K, K.

958
00:59:18,106 --> 00:59:20,416
你得假裝我死了，好嗎？
You gotta fake my death, okay?

959
00:59:20,575 --> 00:59:22,680
我再也受不了這種臥底生活了
I can't listen to sitar music any more.

960
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:25,548
好吧，我盡力，我會和X說的
All right, I'll see what I can do
I'll talk to X.

961
00:59:25,714 --> 00:59:27,915
K，我真的受夠了
K, I can't tell
the women from the men.

962
00:59:28,016 --> 00:59:29,222
幾點了？
May I see your watch?

963
00:59:29,884 --> 00:59:31,124
現在是7:18
Oh, it is 7:18.

964
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:34,022
不，是另一隻懷表，你父親給你的
No, no, your other watch,
the one your father gave you.

965
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,995
你怎麼知道我爸的懷表？
How do you know
about my father's watch?

966
00:59:38,793 --> 00:59:41,034
陌生的啤酒
Strange brew

967
00:59:41,629 --> 00:59:42,903
哎呀
Oh, dear.

968
00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:45,039
這就是羅曼
This is the one
where Roman is dead

969
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,806
和保齡館的人被殺時在旁邊的表
充滿了死亡氣息
and the gentleman at the
bowling alley. So much death.

970
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:51,449
幾乎沒什麼勝算
Such an infinitesimally
small chance for success.

971
00:59:52,307 --> 00:59:53,308
K快來！
K!

972
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:54,212
格裏芬？
Griffin, right?

973
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:55,881
我們在這…
We're here...

974
00:59:56,044 --> 00:59:57,148
因為鮑裏斯
Because of Boris.

975
00:59:57,378 --> 00:59:58,550
我們認為他會…
We think he's coming...

976
00:59:58,713 --> 01:00:00,283
來殺我，他幾分鐘就到
To kill me.
He'll be here in minutes

977
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:01,493
除非
unless we're in

978
01:00:01,649 --> 01:00:03,128
一路綠燈他能早到
the future
where he made the lights

979
01:00:03,284 --> 01:00:04,285
他會
and is about

980
01:00:04,452 --> 01:00:05,658
從大門進來
to shoot from the door,

981
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,163
不一會咱們就全掛了
in which case we're all dead.

982
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:11,730
那是比較靠譜的
Ah, good, that was close one.

983
01:00:11,893 --> 01:00:13,304
K，我需要太空槍
K, I need a space gun.

984
01:00:13,661 --> 01:00:14,571
伯格羅多星人
GRIFFIN:
The Boglodiltes

985
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:16,140
走一路殺一路
consume any planet
in their path.

986
01:00:16,297 --> 01:00:17,605
我的星球，羅曼的星球，帕萊先星球
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'.

987
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:21,612
我設法阻止他們，但如果我們可以在這阻止他
讓他們地球在地球全軍覆沒
I tried to stop them, but if we stop
them here, if we deny them Earth,

988
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,909
他們就完了
we can stop them.
They'll starve before

989
01:00:24,072 --> 01:00:25,142
再也不會禍害其它星球了
they reach the next planet.

990
01:00:26,975 --> 01:00:29,251
還有63秒
Pfft. Sixty-three seconds.

991
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:30,987
我們怎麼做才能組織他們？
How do we do that?
Stop them?

992
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:33,681
什麼？
What? Oh!

993
01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:35,828
抱歉，我給你點東西
Sorry. I have something for you.

994
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:38,157
一份禮物，可以保護你
A gift. It can protect you

995
01:00:38,853 --> 01:00:42,357
因為鮑裏斯要來了我得把它藏起來
如果你還能找到我
I had to hide it from Boris,
but if you find me again,

996
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:44,832
我會把它給你
I'll give it to you.

997
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:48,666
謝謝，多棒的球賽！難以置信！真是奇跡！
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

998
01:00:48,963 --> 01:00:50,499
等下，你說什麼？什麼奇跡？
Whoa. What do you mean?
What miracle?

999
01:00:50,665 --> 01:00:52,269
還有30秒，我得走了
Thirty seconds. I have to go.

1000
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:53,377
不，我們可以保護你
No, we got you.

1001
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:55,980
我們說話時死亡可能性就在增加
Negative possibilities are
multiplying as we speak.

1002
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:57,445
還有20秒
Okay.
Twenty seconds.

1003
01:00:57,605 --> 01:00:58,276
好吧
All right.

1004
01:00:58,439 --> 01:00:59,383
我們應付，放鬆點
We got it, relax.

1005
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:01,713
如果你的表壞了，我有胃痛…
If your watch is broken
and I have gastric...

1006
01:01:01,876 --> 01:01:04,652
飛啊！看看這個世界！
MAN:
Fly! Find your place in the world!

1007
01:01:04,813 --> 01:01:06,486
喔，哎呀
GRIFFIN:
Oh, dear.

1008
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:08,627
鮑裏斯要從大門進來了
Boris is coming through that door

1009
01:01:08,783 --> 01:01:09,488
12秒
in 12.

1010
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:11,289
11秒，10秒…
11,10...

1011
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:12,226
等等！
Wait!

1012
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:13,991
你喝巧克力牛奶了？
Did you have chocolate milk?

1013
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:15,897
什麼？喝了
What-? Yes.

1014
01:01:16,991 --> 01:01:18,026
辛迪
GRIFFIN:
Cindy.

1015
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:20,368
K！
K!

1016
01:01:20,528 --> 01:01:21,336
抓住格裏芬！
Got him Griffin!

1017
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:31,709
該死！
Damn it!

1018
01:01:48,656 --> 01:01:49,896
哎呦！
Ouch!

1019
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,570
我沒事，我沒事
I'm good, I'm good.

1020
01:01:52,727 --> 01:01:53,432
格裏芬呢？
What you got?

1021
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:54,902
跑了

1022
01:01:55,063 --> 01:01:57,134
該死！都抓住他了
Damn it! We had him!

1023
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:59,242
放鬆，科奇斯，他跑不了
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.

1024
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:01,707
首先，我叫J，明白嗎？
First of all, my name is J, okay?

1025
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,783
不是什麼孩子，滑頭
更不是什麼「酋長」
（亞利桑那州著名印第安酋長「科奇斯」）
It's not 'son, ' it's not 'slick'
and it damn sure ain't no 'Cochise.'

1026
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:07,881
我緊張以為咱們沒多少時間了
I'm not gonna relax because
we're running out of time

1027
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:09,612
入侵就快開始了
and there's an invasion coming.

1028
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:12,758
難道你真沒感覺到
我的聲音有多緊張嗎
You're not really recognizing
my voicial intensity.

1029
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:16,384
但有一個人可以幫我們
Oh, but there was one guy
who could help.

1030
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:18,597
格裏芬，格裏芬，他人呢？
Hey, Griffin Griffin Where's Griffin?

1031
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:21,429
格裏芬，哪去了，K？
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?

1032
01:02:21,723 --> 01:02:25,671
他不見了，如果鮑裏斯在我們之前抓到他
可就沒什麼希望了
He's gone. If Boris gets to him
before we do, that's no bueno.

1033
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,266
我們需要吃點派
We need pie.

1034
01:02:27,595 --> 01:02:29,973
- 什麼？
- 我爺爺一直說：
What?
My granddaddy always said:

1035
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:32,371
如果有解決不了的問題
'If you got a problem
you can't solve,

1036
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:34,706
這時候吃點派會有幫助的
it helps to get out of
your head.' Pie. It's good.

1037
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,244
- 派？
- 是啊
Pie?
Yeah.

1038
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:38,042
你爺爺體格很棒吧？
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?

1039
01:02:38,473 --> 01:02:40,783
- 還行
- 你知道嗎？
A little bit.
Yeah, you know what?

1040
01:02:40,942 --> 01:02:42,478
咱們一直做得不錯
We've been doing smart stuff.

1041
01:02:42,677 --> 01:02:44,816
總是順著線索辦好案子
We've been following clues,
doing police work.

1042
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:47,116
可能也有做錯事的時候
It might be time
we do something stupid.

1043
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:50,253
雖然一事無成，但我們盡力了
Something that ain't got
nothing to do with nothing.

1044
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:52,329
現在我也想吃派,K
太想吃派了
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.

1045
01:02:52,487 --> 01:02:53,898
咱倆去吃派吧
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.

1046
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:56,089
好主意
Sounds good.

1047
01:02:59,894 --> 01:03:04,639
寂靜溫暖的夏之夜
（《A Summer Song》）
Sweet, sleepy warmth
Of summer nights

1048
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,242
嗯嗯
Uh-uh.

1049
01:03:11,773 --> 01:03:13,150
嗯哼
Mm.

1050
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:15,912
嗯哼
Mm.

1051
01:03:16,077 --> 01:03:21,083
他們說一切美好終歸會煙消雲散
They say that all good things
Must end some day '.

1052
01:03:21,282 --> 01:03:25,253
嗯...
Hmm...

1053
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:26,964
有特色菜嗎？
Have any specials?

1054
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:30,999
他總是盯著菜單10分鐘後才說出一句
He'll have what he always has after
he reads the menu for 10 minutes

1055
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:32,604
有特色菜嗎
and asks about specials.

1056
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,434
最後還是要一份芝士蘋果派
A slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

1057
01:03:35,596 --> 01:03:37,132
我要草莓派
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.

1058
01:03:37,298 --> 01:03:39,039
這可是我最後一餐，浪費點無所謂
It's my last meal,
I'm gonna splurge.

1059
01:03:42,537 --> 01:03:45,984
世界頂尖殺人魔就在外面
咱倆還有心情在這吃派
World-class serial killer out there
and we're having pie.

1060
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:48,051
業餘時間你都做什麼？
What do you do
in your spare time, stretch?

1061
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,277
啊！
Oh!

1062
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:53,521
我看你沒明白我的意思
See, I sense you're not embracing
the concept here.

1063
01:03:53,681 --> 01:03:55,718
放鬆的吃派更有利於工作
Pie don't work unless you let it.

1064
01:03:55,883 --> 01:03:57,294
我正要嘗試一下
I'm gonna let it.

1065
01:03:57,452 --> 01:03:58,829
你說過咱倆不怎麼聊天？
And you say we don't talk?

1066
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,366
來吧，問我任何你想知道的問題？
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.

1067
01:04:02,523 --> 01:04:06,266
只要和案子無關，什麼都行
As long as it doesn't have to do
with the case. Just let her rip.

1068
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:10,071
你和O咋回事？
What's up with you and O?

1069
01:04:11,566 --> 01:04:12,271
我和O？
Me and O?

1070
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:14,843
啊哈，沒錯，你和O
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, you and O.

1071
01:04:15,003 --> 01:04:16,346
好吧，好吧
All right, all right.

1072
01:04:16,537 --> 01:04:18,210
是這麼回事
All fight, this is it.

1073
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:22,852
前陣子上頭讓我調查一個音樂家
A while back, I was assigned
to keep tabs on a musician.

1074
01:04:23,077 --> 01:04:23,885
米克·賈格？
Mick Jagger?

1075
01:04:24,045 --> 01:04:26,218
他是英國滾石樂隊成員
He's in this British band,
the Rolling Stones.

1076
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:27,492
很耳熟
Rings a bell.

1077
01:04:27,648 --> 01:04:30,925
我們認為他來地球就是為了
和地球女人繁殖後代
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women.

1078
01:04:31,152 --> 01:04:34,361
所以我就到了倫敦
也就在這時遇見了O
So I was in London
and that's when I met O.

1079
01:04:34,522 --> 01:04:38,493
她很聰明，有趣，笑容迷人
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.

1080
01:04:39,594 --> 01:04:42,734
我們在酒吧碰見的
And we find ourselves in this pub,
which is a bar, all right?

1081
01:04:42,897 --> 01:04:46,902
啤酒是溫的而且食物非常難吃
Warm beer and
the worst food you ever ate.

1082
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:50,839
所以我們就一直玩飛鏢，直到天亮
We just played darts
till the sun came up.

1083
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:52,712
誰也不想離開
Neither of us wanted to leave.

1084
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:04,221
後來你怎麼變了？
What the hell happened
to you, man?

1085
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:07,099
不知道，那些事還沒發生呢
I don't know.
It hasn't happened yet.

1086
01:05:07,255 --> 01:05:11,203
你呢，滑頭？有女朋友嗎？
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

1087
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:13,100
有你就夠了
I got you.

1088
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:15,935
不敢相信，操蛋的大都會隊（紐約棒球隊）
MAN 1: I cannot believe this,
freaking New York Mets.

1089
01:05:16,097 --> 01:05:17,474
簡直就是廢物
MAN 2:
Total losers!

1090
01:05:17,632 --> 01:05:19,441
做為大都會的粉絲心裏可不好受
It's a rough time
to be a Mets fan.

1091
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,137
可不是嗎
從來沒贏過小熊隊（芝加哥棒球隊）
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.

1092
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:25,474
有意思，其實大都會最後奪冠了
That's funny. The Mets
actually win it all this year.

1093
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,083
是嗎
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:28,115
不，我是說真的
No, I'm serious.

1095
01:05:28,276 --> 01:05:28,981
我知道
Oh, I'm sure.

1096
01:05:29,143 --> 01:05:31,714
三個月後，那傢伙
Look, three months from now,
your buddies down there

1097
01:05:31,879 --> 01:05:34,052
就得稱他們為不可思議的大都會
are gonna be calling them
the Amazing Mets

1098
01:05:34,215 --> 01:05:35,888
大都會是個奇跡
and the Miracle Mets.

1099
01:05:38,486 --> 01:05:40,227
怎麼？
What?

1100
01:05:40,388 --> 01:05:42,061
你想到什麼了？
What you got there, hoss?

1101
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:47,506
那阿查南星人說過：「太神奇了
就是個奇跡，我看球賽時也看到你了」
The Archanan said, 'lt's amazing
it's a miracle I'll see you at the game.'

1102
01:05:48,663 --> 01:05:50,074
我知道他在哪
I know where he is.

1103
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,933
都跟你說過了吃派絕對好使
Told you to trust the pie.

1104
01:05:57,171 --> 01:06:00,675
如果格裏芬來這看球賽
現在也不是時候啊
K: If Griffin's here for a game,
he's either too early or too late.

1105
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:04,186
他在這，我們得在鮑裏斯之前找到他
J: He's here. We just gotta
find him before Boris does.

1106
01:06:11,452 --> 01:06:13,363
該把東西還給你了
It's time to give you
your things back,

1107
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:14,625
搭檔
partner.

1108
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:16,926
吃完派你還有人情味兒了
You get some pie in you,
you get all mushy.

1109
01:06:17,091 --> 01:06:19,264
只是槍太沉了而已
I'm just tired
of carrying your stuff.

1110
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,839
加油啊！好球！再來一個
GRIFFIN: Boo! Ah, come on now!
All right! Let's go,

1111
01:06:22,997 --> 01:06:23,873
大都會！
Mets!

1112
01:06:24,031 --> 01:06:26,534
加油！大都會！加油！
Let's go, Mets! Let's go,

1113
01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:28,942
- 大都會！加油!
- 格裏芬？
Mets! Let's go, Met-
Griffin?

1114
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:30,775
喔！
Oh!

1115
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:33,118
來得正好！
You're just in time!

1116
01:06:33,274 --> 01:06:37,620
要不是羅賓遜的這幾次失誤，比賽就結束了
Unless this is the one where Robinson
bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.

1117
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:39,189
喔！
Whoo!

1118
01:06:39,714 --> 01:06:41,125
我們錯過什麼了嗎？
Are we missing something?

1119
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,122
球賽
The game.

1120
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:54,696
哇哦
J:
Whoa.

1121
01:07:11,746 --> 01:07:14,989
你就是這麼看東西的？真神奇
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.

1122
01:07:15,149 --> 01:07:18,858
這能力很討厭，但有時用下也不錯
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.

1123
01:07:19,353 --> 01:07:21,390
這可是10月份的比賽
This game doesn't happen
fill October.

1124
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:22,899
我能看到10月
It's always October

1125
01:07:23,157 --> 01:07:24,727
11月，3月的比賽
and November and March.

1126
01:07:24,892 --> 01:07:27,896
當未來展現在你眼前，一切都那麼真實
你不會知道會發生什麼
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.

1127
01:07:28,062 --> 01:07:29,871
直到那時，發生轉折的一刻
Until then, they're all happening.

1128
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:33,012
就像這個，是我最難忘的時刻
Like this one, it's my favourite moment
in human history.

1129
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:36,546
一切有利因素都在大都會這邊
讓他們贏得世界冠軍
All the things that had to converge
for the Mets to win the World Series.

1130
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:39,878
雖然每個賽季他們都是最後一名
但從現在開始就不一樣了
They were in last place every single
season until they won it all.

1131
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,349
你說有禮物要給我們
You said you had a gift.

1132
01:07:41,509 --> 01:07:42,351
那個棒球
That baseball,

1133
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:46,424
就是第五場比賽最後投出去的
由麻省奇科皮的斯波爾丁製造的
thrown for the last out of game five,
manufactured in '62 by Spalding

1134
01:07:46,581 --> 01:07:50,051
由於棒球皮革沒有
of Chicopee, Massachusetts,
was aerodynamically ﬂawed

1135
01:07:50,218 --> 01:07:52,562
正確晾曬導致存在力學缺陷
due to the horsehide
being improperly tanned

1136
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,563
因為制革工人的妻子讓他
because the tanner's wife
left him

1137
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:56,224
為一個波多黎各職業高爾夫球選手服務
for a Puerto Rican golf pro...

1138
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:57,892
禮物呢？
Um, the gift?

1139
01:07:58,059 --> 01:08:00,300
當然，在盒子裏
Oh, yes, of course.
In the box.

1140
01:08:04,298 --> 01:08:07,142
這可是個驚喜，可以保衛地球
Uh, it's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.

1141
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:08,211
這個是盾牌
It's a shield.

1142
01:08:12,907 --> 01:08:13,578
盾牌
J:
Shield.

1143
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:17,646
阿查南星人，天穹網
你建造的天穹網
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.

1144
01:08:17,812 --> 01:08:19,587
- 怎麼用？
- 當球投給
How?
When that ball is pitched to

1145
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:20,589
戴維·約翰遜
Davey Johnson,

1146
01:08:20,748 --> 01:08:21,954
約翰遜之所以成為棒球手
<i>vvho became a player</i>

1147
01:08:22,116 --> 01:08:25,586
因為他父親在他生日時沒弄到橄欖球給他
because his dad couldn't find a
football to give him for his birthday,

1148
01:08:25,753 --> 01:08:26,493
擊打時
it hits

1149
01:08:26,654 --> 01:08:28,634
球棒偏高了2微米
his bat two micrometers
too high,

1150
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:30,132
球剛好被克里昂·瓊斯接住
popping out to Cleon Jones

1151
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:33,234
克里昂本應該是克拉拉
who would've been born Clara,
a statistical

1152
01:08:33,427 --> 01:08:36,897
一個從事打字員工作的女孩
如果他父母在造人當晚
typist, if his parents didn't have
an extra glass of wine that night

1153
01:08:37,064 --> 01:08:38,941
沒喝那麼多酒的話
before going to bed

1154
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,111
奇跡出現時
A miracle

1155
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:43,772
總是覺得不可思議，其實早已命中注定
is what seems impossible
but happens anyway.

1156
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,659
我的星球已經被毀了
I lost my planet.

1157
01:08:54,849 --> 01:08:57,261
我不希望地球也遭受同樣厄運
I don't want you to lose yours.

1158
01:08:57,418 --> 01:08:59,921
它會帶來奇跡，如果你們成功了
It'll lake a miracle,
but if you pull this off,

1159
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:02,123
這會是人類歷史上
you'll be my new
favourite moment

1160
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:04,133
最難忘的時刻
in human history.

1161
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:05,771
哎呀
Oh, dear.

1162
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:07,831
我忘了還有這場好戲
I forgot to see this one coming.

1163
01:09:14,935 --> 01:09:16,005
該死！
Damn it!

1164
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:27,352
未來有這玩意嘛？
Have these in the future?

1165
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:28,619
沒有
No.

1166
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:29,850
騎上去
Get on.

1167
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:35,623
保持回轉儀零增益
Keep gyro settings
at zero gain.

1168
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,361
迅速扳動中央軸可以在
傾斜和偏航時保持平衡
Balance pitch and yaw
with bursts on the center stalk

1169
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:39,903
壓力介於80-100磅每平方英吋
between 80 and 100 psi.

1170
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:41,402
根本沒聽懂
J:
Aah! I didn't understand.

1171
01:09:41,595 --> 01:09:43,006
你說的這些！
Any of that!

1172
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:45,235
- 回轉儀設置到零增益
- 現在就是
Gyro at zero gain.
It is.

1173
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:47,811
在傾斜和偏航時迅速扳動中央軸
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the center stalk.

1174
01:09:47,968 --> 01:09:48,639
我做了
I did.

1175
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:50,749
壓力介於80-100磅每平方英吋
Between 80 and 100 psi.

1176
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:52,841
明白了
Got it.

1177
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:54,709
哇哦！
Whoa!

1178
01:09:55,476 --> 01:09:57,353
把天穹網給我！
BORIS:
The Arc Net! Give it to me!

1179
01:09:57,511 --> 01:09:59,388
你找不到的
GRIFFIN:
This isn't the one where you get it!

1180
01:09:59,547 --> 01:10:01,652
- 感覺怎麼樣，頭兒？
- 還行
All right there, chief?
Hell, yeah.

1181
01:10:01,816 --> 01:10:03,352
要是4個輪子就好了
It'd be better with four wheels!

1182
01:10:03,517 --> 01:10:04,860
至少也得兩個吧
Two is, like, my minimum.

1183
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:14,239
如果鮑裏斯拿到天穹網會怎樣？
K: What happens if Boris
gets the Arc Net?

1184
01:10:14,395 --> 01:10:16,671
伯格羅多星人會大舉入侵，地球毀滅！
J: Boglodite invasion, total
destruction of Earth!

1185
01:10:40,855 --> 01:10:42,562
盒子！
The box!

1186
01:10:53,768 --> 01:10:55,042
好孩子
Good boy.

1187
01:10:55,436 --> 01:10:56,938
咱們得阻止他！
We gotta stop this guy!

1188
01:10:59,206 --> 01:11:00,082
我一直在努力！
J:
I've been trying!

1189
01:11:00,274 --> 01:11:01,617
你努力過？
You haven't been trying?

1190
01:11:02,176 --> 01:11:02,813
滑頭
K:
Hey, slick.

1191
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:06,215
在未來，還有人跳德州兩步舞嗎？
In the future,
we ever do the Texas two-step?

1192
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,053
有，長官！
Yes, sir!

1193
01:11:33,474 --> 01:11:34,452
抓到他了嗎？
Did you get him?

1194
01:11:34,775 --> 01:11:36,254
給我點時間
Give me a sec.

1195
01:11:40,648 --> 01:11:41,524
他死了？
Is he dead?

1196
01:11:41,982 --> 01:11:43,359
沒有
Negative.

1197
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:45,457
他跑了
He got away.

1198
01:11:47,922 --> 01:11:49,765
格裏芬沒事，咱們走吧
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.

1199
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:06,610
我已經有年輕的感覺了
I feel younger already.

1200
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,690
（1969年7月16日凌晨3:06）

1201
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:36,246
你這個可憐的廢物
You pathetic waste
of Boglodite flesh.

1202
01:12:36,403 --> 01:12:39,714
如果你跟我沒關係
我立刻就殺了你
I'd kill you right now,
if I didn't value my own life.

1203
01:12:39,974 --> 01:12:41,749
- 你是誰？
- 看看你自己
Who are you?
Look at you.

1204
01:12:41,909 --> 01:12:44,981
眼看我的過失即將發生
Every mistake I've ever made,
just waiting to happen.

1205
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:46,317
我的胳膊怎麼了？
What happened to my arm?

1206
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,721
被人類打斷了
You lose it, shot off by a human.

1207
01:12:48,883 --> 01:12:50,362
人類不可能擊敗我
No human could defeat me.

1208
01:12:50,718 --> 01:12:54,996
接下來你在監獄呆了40年
像野獸一樣被鎖住
You spend the next 40 years in
prison, chained up like an animal.

1209
01:12:55,155 --> 01:12:57,032
沒有我逃不出的監獄！
No prison can hold me!

1210
01:12:57,191 --> 01:12:59,899
這是他們特別為我們建造的，在月球上
They built one especially for us,
on the moon.

1211
01:13:00,227 --> 01:13:02,036
人類還沒登月呢
No human has been to the moon,

1212
01:13:02,196 --> 01:13:04,870
所以他們不能在那建監獄
so they cannot have
built it there already.

1213
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:08,036
別跟我爭！
如果聽我的你就能避免這一切
Stop arguing! You can avoid
all of that if you just listen to me!

1214
01:13:08,202 --> 01:13:11,843
你輸了！是你讓我的胳膊被打斷的！
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!

1215
01:13:12,006 --> 01:13:14,816
不是我，是你！
That wasn't me, that was you!

1216
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,058
你有什麼計劃？
What's your plan?

1217
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:23,521
阻止建造天穹網
Prevent the Arc Net
from being deployed.

1218
01:13:23,684 --> 01:13:26,221
- 殺光想阻止我們的人
- 好主意
Kill anyone who tries
Good plan.

1219
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,698
沒我的幫忙
Didn't work.

1220
01:13:27,855 --> 01:13:28,833
你幹不成
With my help.

1221
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:31,935
弄到天穹網，殺了K探員
We'll get the Arc Net,
kill Agent K,

1222
01:13:32,092 --> 01:13:34,402
我們就無可匹敵了！
the invasion will be successful

1223
01:13:34,595 --> 01:13:36,131
咱們倆都能有兩隻胳膊……
and we'll get to keep both

1224
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,708
啊！
of our ar...! Argh! Stop

1225
01:13:38,866 --> 01:13:40,368
別盯著它看！
sharing at it!

1226
01:13:41,268 --> 01:13:42,372
聽著
Listen.

1227
01:13:57,718 --> 01:14:00,961
- 你還好嗎？
- 謝謝你救了我
You all right?
Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.

1228
01:14:01,255 --> 01:14:02,165
應該做的
It's what we do.

1229
01:14:03,257 --> 01:14:04,497
天穹網還在你那嗎？
You still have the Arc Net?

1230
01:14:06,727 --> 01:14:08,900
情況越糟
When you're being hunted
by Boris the Animal,

1231
01:14:09,063 --> 01:14:10,770
越能急中生智
you get good at hiding things.

1232
01:14:17,404 --> 01:14:18,644
哇哦
J:
Whoa.

1233
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:38,261
這可以拯救地球
This will save your world.

1234
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:43,334
一旦暴露在大氣層中
Once it's outside the atmosphere,
it gets

1235
01:14:43,497 --> 01:14:44,805
會形成巨大的防護罩
a whole lot bigger.

1236
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,843
你們得去部署它了
All you have to do is deploy it.

1237
01:14:48,936 --> 01:14:52,349
你是指在太空嗎？你想讓我們怎麼做？
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?

1238
01:14:52,506 --> 01:14:55,180
這並不難
Ah, it's just one small step.

1239
01:15:06,776 --> 01:15:08,885
（紐約時報：今日發射月球火箭！）

1240
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:10,725
月球火箭
The moon launch.

1241
01:15:14,194 --> 01:15:15,867
卡納維拉爾角
Cape Canaveral.

1242
01:15:17,197 --> 01:15:20,076
1969年7月16日
July 16th, 1969.

1243
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:22,037
我們得用6小時內到達佛羅里達
We got six hours to get to Florida.

1244
01:15:22,369 --> 01:15:23,746
最好趕快出發，滑頭
Better get a move on, slick.

1245
01:15:24,038 --> 01:15:25,016
等等，聽我說
Uh, wait, uh, hold up.

1246
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:27,311
不用兩個人一起
我自己去就行了
Not us.
Uh, I'm gonna do this one alone.

1247
01:15:27,474 --> 01:15:28,384
他必須得…
He has to be the...

1248
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:29,486
格裏芬，噓
Griffin. Shh-shh-shh.

1249
01:15:29,643 --> 01:15:30,713
你什麼意思，自己？
What do you mean, alone?

1250
01:15:31,478 --> 01:15:33,355
我獨自去佛羅里達，你呆在這
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.

1251
01:15:33,514 --> 01:15:34,754
你得相信我
I need you to trust me.

1252
01:15:35,215 --> 01:15:38,924
相信你？我可不這麼想
有什麼事瞞著我，滑頭？
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?

1253
01:15:39,086 --> 01:15:40,565
你不能去佛羅里達
You're not going to Florida.

1254
01:15:40,721 --> 01:15:42,496
不可能，搭檔
That ain't gonna happen, partner.

1255
01:15:42,656 --> 01:15:44,033
瞧,K
Look, K.

1256
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:46,868
拜託，我不允許你佛羅里達
Please, I will not allow you
to go to Florida.

1257
01:15:48,996 --> 01:15:49,701
那就阻止我
Stop me.

1258
01:15:54,902 --> 01:15:56,347
你在那死的！
You die there!

1259
01:15:59,073 --> 01:16:02,179
卡納維拉爾角，阿波羅火箭發射
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.

1260
01:16:04,078 --> 01:16:05,921
鮑裏斯在那殺了你
Boris kills you there.

1261
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:09,884
這就是我來這的原因
That's what I'm here for.

1262
01:16:10,517 --> 01:16:12,019
我到這來就是為了阻止這一切
That's what I came back to stop.

1263
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:14,199
哎呀，一波未平一波又起
Oh, dear. We're in this one.

1264
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:17,501
K！
K...

1265
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:20,364
我看過檔案和報告
I saw the file,
I looked at the report.

1266
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:21,733
我說過告訴你的一切…
I said I told you everything...

1267
01:16:23,363 --> 01:16:24,899
這拳為了你對我說謊
That's for lying to me.

1268
01:16:25,132 --> 01:16:26,202
我道歉還不行嗎！
Look, I'm sorry, man!

1269
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,735
啊！
Aah!

1270
01:16:29,269 --> 01:16:31,010
這拳為了告訴我真相！
That's for telling me the truth!

1271
01:16:32,272 --> 01:16:34,149
我只想保護你
I'm trying to protect you.

1272
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:36,820
老兄！
Man!

1273
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:38,619
啊！
Aah!

1274
01:16:38,879 --> 01:16:41,553
忠言逆耳利於行
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lies.

1275
01:16:41,715 --> 01:16:43,058
噓，噓！
Shh-shh!

1276
01:16:45,285 --> 01:16:47,128
他必須得去卡納維拉爾角
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

1277
01:16:47,287 --> 01:16:50,063
必須由他部署天穹網，這是他的命運
He must deploy the Arc Net
as he did before.

1278
01:16:50,224 --> 01:16:51,726
沒別的辦法
There's no other way.

1279
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:55,466
拯救地球是他唯一的期望
K is the only hope
in saving Earth.

1280
01:16:56,296 --> 01:16:57,832
我能拯救他嗎？
Can I save him?

1281
01:16:58,732 --> 01:17:02,544
有沒有哪個時間點我可以救他？
Is there any future
where I save his life?

1282
01:17:04,972 --> 01:17:06,781
有
Yes.

1283
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:10,549
但在死亡之地
But where there is death

1284
01:17:11,478 --> 01:17:13,924
總會有死亡發生
there will always be death.

1285
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:33,608
按你說的，我之前都做過了
According to you,
I've done this before.

1286
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:35,178
所以肯定能行
So we know it's possible.

1287
01:17:35,335 --> 01:17:37,315
如果真像你說的那樣
If you're half the agent
you say you are,

1288
01:17:37,471 --> 01:17:39,781
就想辦法別讓我被殺
you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.

1289
01:17:44,178 --> 01:17:46,158
我們不是搭檔嗎？你跟我說的
So are we partners? You tell me.

1290
01:17:49,016 --> 01:17:50,620
咱們出發
Let's go.

1291
01:18:03,697 --> 01:18:04,641
K探員
O:
Agent K,

1292
01:18:04,798 --> 01:18:06,209
- 你好嗎？
- 很好
how are you?
I'm good.

1293
01:18:06,366 --> 01:18:09,540
等出發時再擁抱也不遲
Okay, group hug on the way
to doing what we're doing.

1294
01:18:09,703 --> 01:18:13,913
今早宇航員將帶著人類的期盼
This morning, man is about
to launch himself on a trip to the moon

1295
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,587
飛往月球並在那著陸
with the expectation
of landing there.

1296
01:18:16,743 --> 01:18:18,222
我得問問你
Look, I gotta ask you.

1297
01:18:18,378 --> 01:18:20,756
如果我們成功了，建造了天穹網
If we pull this off,
fix things the way they were,

1298
01:18:20,914 --> 01:18:22,723
我和O，是不是…？
O and I, are we...?

1299
01:18:22,883 --> 01:18:24,089
有個聰明人曾經跟我說過
A wise man once told me,

1300
01:18:24,251 --> 01:18:27,061
不該知道的就別問
don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

1301
01:18:28,388 --> 01:18:31,062
- 我說的，是嗎？
- 是的，先生
I said that, didn't I?
Yes, sir.

1302
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:37,208
在這
O:
Here they are.

1303
01:18:38,065 --> 01:18:40,204
- 他們是什麼？
- 噴氣飛行器
J: What are they?
Jetpacks..

1304
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:41,744
噴氣飛行器？
Jetpacks?

1305
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:45,741
不，我們不用噴氣飛行器
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.

1306
01:18:45,906 --> 01:18:48,250
未來也不會用
There's a reason we don't
have these in the future.

1307
01:18:48,408 --> 01:18:49,409
K，咱們開車過去吧
K, we gotta drive.

1308
01:18:49,843 --> 01:18:52,790
從佛羅里達到曼哈頓島
5小時可開不到，長官
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan
in five hours, chief.

1309
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,028
可以的，按紅色按鈕
這是咱們專用車的標配
Yeah, we can. The red button,
standard issue in every MiB car.

1310
01:18:57,184 --> 01:18:59,061
按下它，就能以超光速行駛
Press the red button,
goes into hyperdrive.

1311
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:01,028
別忘了紅色按鈕還沒發明呢，滑頭
No red buttons yet, slick.

1312
01:19:02,756 --> 01:19:04,895
拜託，夥計
Come on, man.

1313
01:19:09,963 --> 01:19:10,805
你知道
Do you know

1314
01:19:10,964 --> 01:19:12,272
這笨傢伙怎麼用嗎？
how to work this stupid thing?

1315
01:19:12,432 --> 01:19:14,571
並不難
It's like with anything.

1316
01:19:14,735 --> 01:19:18,683
繫上安全帶，往好了想就行
Just have to strap yourself in,
hope for the best.

1317
01:19:19,773 --> 01:19:21,081
我說的對嗎，O小姐？
Isn't that right, Miss O?

1318
01:19:22,442 --> 01:19:24,444
很不幸，是的
Unfortunately, it is.

1319
01:19:35,622 --> 01:19:36,930
準備好沒，滑頭？
You ready, slick?

1320
01:19:38,792 --> 01:19:40,328
哦了
Let's get it.

1321
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,403
這一定很有趣！
This is gonna be interesting!

1322
01:19:55,309 --> 01:19:57,619
具有歷史意義的阿波羅11號
It's just minutes to the

1323
01:19:57,811 --> 01:19:59,449
一切準備就緒
historic launch of Apollo 11

1324
01:19:59,613 --> 01:20:01,957
即將發射
with all going well.

1325
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:21,506
咱們這次沒爆炸真好
I'm so glad this isn't
one of the times we explode.

1326
01:20:21,768 --> 01:20:23,475
這次？
One of the times?

1327
01:20:26,306 --> 01:20:27,842
有麻煩了
Oh, we got company...

1328
01:20:32,379 --> 01:20:33,858
啥玩意？
The hell?

1329
01:20:35,449 --> 01:20:37,395
還得用電池嗎？
Is that a battery belt?

1330
01:20:47,294 --> 01:20:48,830
好吧，我來
All right, I got it.

1331
01:20:52,032 --> 01:20:54,569
不，實際情況是你們得把部署天穹網
No, any reality
that gets the shield deployed

1332
01:20:54,801 --> 01:20:56,542
的真相告訴他們才行
is one where you tell the truth.

1333
01:20:56,903 --> 01:20:58,314
真相？
The truth?

1334
01:20:58,638 --> 01:21:00,640
只有告訴他們真相才是唯一出路
The truth is the only path.

1335
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:02,514
這裏被封鎖了
This is a restricted areal.

1336
01:21:07,547 --> 01:21:09,527
是啊，長官
Yes, sir, it is.

1337
01:21:09,683 --> 01:21:12,664
今天是個好日子，先生們
美國歷史上偉大的一天，不是嗎？
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

1338
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:16,494
我是J探員，他是K探員，這是格裏芬
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.

1339
01:21:16,656 --> 01:21:18,727
我們隸屬政府秘密組織
We're from a secret government
organization

1340
01:21:18,892 --> 01:21:22,499
負責監督治理外星人活動
避免給地球帶來困擾
that polices and monitors
alien activity on and off planet Earth.

1341
01:21:23,897 --> 01:21:25,035
這有個東西
Heh, here's the thing.

1342
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:27,678
是個很特別的金屬製品
We have this special
little metal thingy

1343
01:21:27,834 --> 01:21:31,611
格裏芬給我的，我們得把他放到火箭上
that Griff gave us that we have
to get on top of that rocket,

1344
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:35,412
這樣才可以阻止外星人入侵
heh, heh,
to prevent an alien invasion.

1345
01:21:38,845 --> 01:21:39,789
這就行了
That worked.

1346
01:21:39,946 --> 01:21:42,688
- 效果立竿見影
- 長官，德拉門這邊有情況
Like a charm.
MP: Sir, Della Gate. We have a problem.

1347
01:21:43,016 --> 01:21:46,395
3人擅自闖入，沒有身份證
但攜帶武器，長官
Three trespassers. No IDs,
but they've got weapons, sir.

1348
01:21:46,586 --> 01:21:48,759
這東西從沒見過
Some kind I've never seen before.

1349
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:58,066
怎麼會有這麼蠢的人
What breed of fool
do you have to be

1350
01:21:58,231 --> 01:22:01,144
在如此重要的日子
to penetrate my site
on the day of the most massive feat

1351
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:02,574
闖入我的地盤？
attempted by mankind?

1352
01:22:02,736 --> 01:22:05,649
在上帝，全體國民以及
Watched by God, the population
of the planet and my own

1353
01:22:05,839 --> 01:22:06,943
- 我的兒子面前
- 上校
firstborn
MP: Colonel?

1354
01:22:07,874 --> 01:22:08,978
上校，這是他們帶的東西
Colonel, they had these.

1355
01:22:10,143 --> 01:22:12,316
他們說得把什麼東西放在火箭上
They said they needed
to put something on the rocket

1356
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:13,651
來防止入侵
for an invasion.

1357
01:22:17,884 --> 01:22:18,885
謝謝
Thanks.

1358
01:22:19,086 --> 01:22:20,360
還有10分鐘火箭發射
I got 10 minutes to launch.

1359
01:22:20,587 --> 01:22:24,626
如果這對火箭構成威脅
現在就告訴我，別撒謊
If you pose a threat to that rocket,
you tell me now and do not lie to me.

1360
01:22:29,062 --> 01:22:31,064
我說的都是事實
I told the truth last time.

1361
01:22:36,069 --> 01:22:37,878
長官，他為了救我
Sir, this man came here from

1362
01:22:38,071 --> 01:22:39,448
從未來穿梭至今
the future to protect me

1363
01:22:39,606 --> 01:22:43,019
我可以在火箭頂端裝上盾牌來拯救地球
so I can attach a shield to the top
of that rocket and save the world.

1364
01:22:43,176 --> 01:22:45,156
這需要你的幫助
I need your help to do that.

1365
01:22:48,315 --> 01:22:49,623
把他帶到禁閉室
Take them to the brig.

1366
01:22:49,783 --> 01:22:51,285
真有你的，格裏芬
You're slipping, Griff.

1367
01:22:51,818 --> 01:22:52,990
長官，如果可以
Sir, if I may.

1368
01:23:09,269 --> 01:23:09,940
下士
Corporal.

1369
01:23:11,338 --> 01:23:12,681
你們可以走了
You men are no longer needed.

1370
01:23:13,173 --> 01:23:14,311
這些人交給我
I'll take the prisoners.

1371
01:23:14,674 --> 01:23:16,517
- 長官，你…？
- 退下
Sir, are you-?
Dismissed.

1372
01:23:25,352 --> 01:23:26,353
跟我來
Follow me.

1373
01:23:33,727 --> 01:23:35,900
你用超能力讓他看到什麼了？
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?

1374
01:23:36,062 --> 01:23:38,201
只是他應該知道的事
Only what he needed to see.

1375
01:23:39,533 --> 01:23:40,944
我得走了
I have to go now.

1376
01:23:42,035 --> 01:23:43,480
什麼？不，來吧
What? No, no, no. Come on.

1377
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,372
你不再需要我了
You don't need me any more.

1378
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:48,183
好吧，格裏芬，別逗我了
All right, Griff,
don't start ﬂipping on me.

1379
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:51,811
當鮑裏斯斷臂時
往事就已注定，K會沒事的
When Boris' arm is taken, the past
will be as it was. K will survive.

1380
01:23:51,978 --> 01:23:53,958
他不會知道你曾經來過這
He will not know
you were ever here.

1381
01:23:55,649 --> 01:23:59,722
斷臂，我知道，就像復位一樣？
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?

1382
01:23:59,886 --> 01:24:03,163
當這事發生時
回到你原來的地方，離開這
When that happens, go home.
Leave.

1383
01:24:03,323 --> 01:24:03,994
你還來不來？
You coming?

1384
01:24:04,157 --> 01:24:06,159
來
Yeah, all right!

1385
01:24:07,227 --> 01:24:10,572
多謝，老兄，我還會見到你嗎？
Uh, thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?

1386
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:12,605
一切皆有可能
Anything's possible.

1387
01:24:14,834 --> 01:24:16,609
噢，格裏芬
Oh, Griff.

1388
01:24:22,909 --> 01:24:25,412
真不忍心看到這一切
I can never bear to watch this part.

1389
01:24:27,347 --> 01:24:29,020
北美東部時間週一清晨
Armstrong
and Aldrin are scheduled

1390
01:24:29,182 --> 01:24:31,093
阿姆斯特朗和奧爾德林
to set foot on the moon

1391
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:35,222
將正式踏上月球之旅
on early Monday morning,
Eastern Daylight Time.

1392
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:37,364
格裏芬呢？
Where's Griffin?

1393
01:24:37,557 --> 01:24:39,298
有事先走了
Doing his own thing.

1394
01:25:01,948 --> 01:25:02,653
先生們
COLONEL Gentlemen.

1395
01:25:06,753 --> 01:25:08,994
這電梯能把你們送到頂上
This elevator
will take you to the top.

1396
01:25:09,155 --> 01:25:11,157
你們可以把天穹網
To get the Arc Net
outside the atmosphere,

1397
01:25:11,324 --> 01:25:14,328
綁在太空艙上方的分離火箭上
來接觸大氣層
you need to strap it to the escape
rocket above the capsule!

1398
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:15,904
火箭發射時
You do not want to be

1399
01:25:16,062 --> 01:25:18,303
一定要離得遠遠的！
anywhere near this rocket
when it takes off!

1400
01:25:18,465 --> 01:25:20,843
- 還有問題嗎？
- 沒了，謝謝你，上校
Questions?
No. Thank you for this, colonel.

1401
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,604
你們任務艱巨
Some job you got there.

1402
01:25:22,836 --> 01:25:24,008
多謝，哥們
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.

1403
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:26,673
格裏芬給你看什麼了？
What did Griff
show you back there?

1404
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,285
你們有多重要
How important you are.

1405
01:25:28,608 --> 01:25:30,178
你和你搭檔
You and your partner.

1406
01:25:38,451 --> 01:25:40,863
如果一切順利
J: Look, If everything goes right
the way we hope it does,

1407
01:25:41,054 --> 01:25:43,796
我得盡快離開這回到未來
I'm gonna end up
getting out of here pretty quick,

1408
01:25:43,957 --> 01:25:47,370
可能沒機會向你告別
so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

1409
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,098
如果事情不順利，我也沒機會跟你告別
If things go wrong, not gonna
have a chance to, either.

1410
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:54,670
能否成功就看咱們了
So I guess win or lose,
this is it.

1411
01:25:59,205 --> 01:26:01,116
我知道我為什麼雇你了
I see why I recruited you.

1412
01:26:03,977 --> 01:26:05,081
你是個好人
You're a good man.

1413
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:10,185
好人
Good man.

1414
01:26:12,652 --> 01:26:14,893
夥計，你怎麼變這樣了？
Man, what the hell
happened to you?

1415
01:26:15,322 --> 01:26:17,666
我跟你說過
有些事還沒發生所以我也不清楚
I told you,
it still hasn't happened yet.

1416
01:26:22,495 --> 01:26:24,202
我對付這個！
J:
I'll take this one!

1417
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:25,701
真不懂規矩
Naughty...

1418
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:30,472
如果你輸了應該去修修腳
Get a pedicure if you get a second.

1419
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,519
去死吧
And lift off.

1420
01:27:23,957 --> 01:27:25,698
開始進入最後倒計時兩分鐘
Just passed the two-minute mark

1421
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:29,306
各項參數顯示正常
in the countdown, and all is still go
as we monitor our status board.

1422
01:27:50,617 --> 01:27:53,427
宇航員狀況良好，動力分配已完成
MAN: Astronauts report it feels good.
Power transfer is complete.

1423
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:57,256
尼爾·阿姆斯特朗報告倒計時一切正常
Neil Armstrong just reported back
it's been a real smooth countdown.

1424
01:28:09,736 --> 01:28:10,771
嘿！
Hey!

1425
01:28:11,004 --> 01:28:12,642
鮑裏斯，幫個忙好嗎？
Boris, can you give me a hand?

1426
01:28:12,806 --> 01:28:15,286
嘿！啊！
Hey! Aah!

1427
01:28:19,312 --> 01:28:20,086
嘿！
Hey!

1428
01:28:21,014 --> 01:28:22,652
我喊你聽見沒？
You hear me calling you?

1429
01:28:23,516 --> 01:28:25,018
禽獸鮑裏斯！
Boris the Animal!

1430
01:28:25,518 --> 01:28:26,189
嘿！
Hey!

1431
01:28:26,352 --> 01:28:28,525
禽獸鮑裏斯！
Boris the Animal!

1432
01:28:30,423 --> 01:28:32,801
是「鮑裏斯」！
It's just Boris!

1433
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:37,664
你輸定了
You're gonna lose.

1434
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:39,238
咱們走著瞧
Let's agree to disagree.

1435
01:28:58,852 --> 01:29:00,024
嘿！
Hey!

1436
01:29:01,054 --> 01:29:02,692
禽獸鮑裏斯！
Boris the Animal!

1437
01:29:12,665 --> 01:29:13,473
右
Right.

1438
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:14,971
左
Left.

1439
01:29:22,329 --> 01:29:24,673
（1969年7月16日上午9:30）

1440
01:29:43,029 --> 01:29:43,939
你輸定了
You're gonna lose.

1441
01:29:44,097 --> 01:29:46,168
咱們走著瞧
Let's agree to disagree.

1442
01:29:55,041 --> 01:29:56,418
嘿！
Hey!

1443
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:58,919
禽獸鮑裏斯！
Boris the Animal!

1444
01:30:05,852 --> 01:30:06,557
右
Right.

1445
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,456
左，左
Left. Left.

1446
01:30:09,556 --> 01:30:10,330
右
Right.

1447
01:30:14,394 --> 01:30:16,374
這不可能
That's not possible.

1448
01:30:16,629 --> 01:30:18,575
咱們走著瞧
Let's agree to disagree.

1449
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,944
這可不能！
That's not possible!

1450
01:30:36,249 --> 01:30:37,250
K！
K!

1451
01:30:38,918 --> 01:30:41,262
我贏了！比那老傢伙強！
I win! I'm better than me!

1452
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:49,935
這才是我搭檔
That's my partner.

1453
01:30:50,396 --> 01:30:52,239
這才是我搭檔！
That's my partner!

1454
01:30:58,438 --> 01:30:59,473
如果把這個報上去
If we call this in,

1455
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:02,313
- 他們會取消發射
- 我什麼也沒看見
they'll scrub the launch.
I didn't see anything

1456
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:38,887
- 你搭檔呢？
- 他回去了
Where's your partner?
He went home.

1457
01:31:39,045 --> 01:31:40,547
- 結果如何？
- 你懂的
How does that work?
You got me.

1458
01:31:40,713 --> 01:31:42,021
快走！
Come on!

1459
01:31:56,863 --> 01:31:57,671
跪下！
Get down!

1460
01:32:23,589 --> 01:32:25,000
哇哦
Wow.

1461
01:32:28,728 --> 01:32:30,071
贏啦
K:
Bingo.

1462
01:32:30,997 --> 01:32:33,068
夥計，那東西可真先進
Man, that is
some next-level stuff.

1463
01:32:43,076 --> 01:32:44,419
還想看這東西的話
You ever want to see more,

1464
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:47,921
我知道一個絕密組織
正需要你這樣的人
I know a top-secret organization
that could use a man like you.

1465
01:32:49,849 --> 01:32:51,522
但願我可以
I wish I could.

1466
01:32:52,085 --> 01:32:53,063
謝謝
Thank you.

1467
01:32:53,686 --> 01:32:55,563
後會有期，K
I'll see you around, K.

1468
01:32:57,290 --> 01:32:57,995
當心！
Look out!

1469
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:04,935
來啊
Go ahead.

1470
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:06,939
逮捕我吧
Arrest me.

1471
01:33:08,534 --> 01:33:10,207
這次不同
Not this time.

1472
01:33:20,213 --> 01:33:23,217
在死亡之地，總會有死亡發生
'Where there's death,
there will always be death.'.

1473
01:33:32,558 --> 01:33:35,801
爸爸！爸爸！
BOY:
Daddy! Daddy!

1474
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:40,673
嘿
K:
Hey...

1475
01:33:41,734 --> 01:33:43,680
我是K，你叫什麼？
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?

1476
01:33:44,237 --> 01:33:45,272
詹姆斯
James.

1477
01:33:45,438 --> 01:33:47,975
詹姆斯？這名字不錯
K:
James? That's a nice name.

1478
01:33:48,174 --> 01:33:49,551
我爸爸呢？
Where's my dad?

1479
01:33:52,411 --> 01:33:54,288
你手裏拿的什麼？
What have you got there?
What is that?

1480
01:33:54,447 --> 01:33:55,824
我爸爸給我的
My dad gave it to me.

1481
01:33:55,982 --> 01:33:58,258
可以看火箭發射時間
We timed the launch.

1482
01:34:05,358 --> 01:34:07,167
我爸爸哪去了？
Where is my daddy?

1483
01:34:11,264 --> 01:34:12,675
他…
He, uh...

1484
01:34:13,266 --> 01:34:17,009
他有一些特別的事情要做
He went to go do something
very special.

1485
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:19,047
他讓我留下來
And he wanted me

1486
01:34:19,205 --> 01:34:23,585
照顧你這個小朋友
to stay here and take care
of his best pal.

1487
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:30,620
那他什麼時候回來？
When is he gonna be back?

1488
01:34:31,784 --> 01:34:33,161
他…
He, uh...

1489
01:34:47,967 --> 01:34:49,412
詹姆斯…
James...

1490
01:34:50,803 --> 01:34:52,578
看這裏
if you look right here,

1491
01:34:52,738 --> 01:34:55,981
我會告訴你想知道的唯一事情
I will tell you the only thing
you ever need to know.

1492
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,255
你老爸是個英雄
Your daddy is a hero.

1493
01:35:03,482 --> 01:35:05,928
我爸爸是英雄？
My daddy is a hero?

1494
01:35:09,155 --> 01:35:12,432
- 想和我去走走嗎？
- 好啊
K: Want to take a walk with me?
Yes.

1495
01:35:22,001 --> 01:35:23,275
詹姆斯
James?

1496
01:35:36,749 --> 01:35:39,025
在這個由夢想鑄成的
（《Empire State Of Mind》）
Concrete jungle where dreams

1497
01:35:39,185 --> 01:35:41,096
全是高樓大廈的城市裏
Are made of
There's nothing '

1498
01:35:41,254 --> 01:35:43,359
你可以為所欲為
You can't do

1499
01:35:43,522 --> 01:35:46,298
因為你現在在紐約
Now you're in New York

1500
01:35:46,459 --> 01:35:47,870
哦，耶
Oh, yeah

1501
01:35:48,027 --> 01:35:49,631
街道會讓你
These streets will make you '.

1502
01:35:49,795 --> 01:35:51,433
感覺煥然一新
K:
Feel brand-new

1503
01:35:52,531 --> 01:35:54,067
燈光將激勵你
The lights will inspire you

1504
01:35:55,534 --> 01:35:57,241
紐約
New York

1505
01:35:58,371 --> 01:36:00,578
紐約
New York

1506
01:36:01,607 --> 01:36:03,245
紐約
New York

1507
01:36:05,678 --> 01:36:07,316
你來晚了
You're late.

1508
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,756
抱歉，忘看表了
Uh, sorry. Lost track of time.

1509
01:36:11,717 --> 01:36:12,923
你怎麼知道那歌？
How do you know that song?

1510
01:36:13,286 --> 01:36:15,323
喝你的咖啡吧，還有活幹呢
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.

1511
01:36:16,222 --> 01:36:17,997
你知道你不知道的那些事嗎？
What do you know
and what do you don't?

1512
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,897
我不知道怎麼可能知道？
How do I know what I don't know?

1513
01:36:20,059 --> 01:36:22,972
這問題是挺有意思
昨晚咱倆去吳的餐廳沒？
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?

1514
01:36:23,129 --> 01:36:23,903
去了
Yeah.

1515
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:25,106
伯格羅多星人？
Boglodites?

1516
01:36:25,264 --> 01:36:26,072
40年前就滅絕了
Extinct for 40 years.

1517
01:36:26,465 --> 01:36:28,741
太好了，昨晚咱倆通電話沒？
Perfect. Did we talk
on the phone last night?

1518
01:36:28,901 --> 01:36:30,141
你把我電話掛了
You hung up on me.

1519
01:36:30,569 --> 01:36:32,207
是啊
Yeah, I did.

1520
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:35,412
因為這些秘密
But that was because
of all those secrets

1521
01:36:35,942 --> 01:36:38,855
宇宙都不知道
the universe
doesn't know about.

1522
01:36:43,582 --> 01:36:44,356
可是…
But...

1523
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,525
我發現
I've realized that

1524
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,199
昨晚的事已經過了
last night was a long,

1525
01:36:49,355 --> 01:36:51,665
好久好久
long time ago.

1526
01:36:55,928 --> 01:36:58,670
實際上只是想說句謝謝你
And, really,
I just want to say thank you.

1527
01:36:59,265 --> 01:37:01,267
那我太榮幸了
It's been my Privilege...

1528
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:13,522
你知道嗎，現在來說很可能
You know, there's really
high possibility now

1529
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,285
我知道的一些事你不知道
that I might know some things
you don't know.

1530
01:37:16,449 --> 01:37:18,019
我才不信
I doubt it.
Heh.

1531
01:37:18,184 --> 01:37:20,164
我打賭我知道你和O為什麼會這樣
I bet I know what went down
with you and O.

1532
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:22,230
他是個好女人，但你知道規矩
K: She's a very fine lady,
but you know the rules.

1533
01:37:22,388 --> 01:37:24,561
探員之間不許過分親密
There's no fraternizing
amongst agents.

1534
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:27,465
我想你們倆在酒吧那晚也算挺親密吧
J: I think y'all might have
fraternized a time or two.

1535
01:37:30,629 --> 01:37:33,974
這才是真正最令我難忘的時刻
This is my new favourite moment
in human history.

1536
01:37:34,133 --> 01:37:37,376
除非K忘了付小費
Unless this is the one
where K forgot to leave a tip.

1537
01:37:51,984 --> 01:37:53,861
差點忘了
Almost forgot.

1538
01:38:02,395 --> 01:38:04,102
千鈞一髮
That was a close one.

1539
01:38:04,122 --> 01:38:07,498
