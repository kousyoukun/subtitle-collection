1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,168
<i>Hello.</i>

2
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,601
<i>I come from outside the wall,</i>

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,081
<i>where we have all but
destroyed each other.</i>

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,608
<i>We designed your city
as an experiment.</i>

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,129
<i>We believe it is the only way to
recover the humanity we have lost.</i>

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,009
<i>And we created factions
to ensure peace.</i>

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,162
<i>But we believe there
will be those among you</i>

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,323
<i>who will transcend
these factions.</i>

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,011
<i>These will be the Divergent.</i>

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,890
<i>They are the true purpose
of this experiment.</i>

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,010
<i>They are vital to
humanity's survival.</i>

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,570
<i>If you're watching this now,</i>

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,440
<i>then at least one of you is proof
that our experiment has succeeded.</i>

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,010
<i>The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.</i>

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,522
On Evelyn's orders, this
gate is now closed.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,127
<i>We've allowed you to believe
that you're the last of us.</i>

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,487
<i>But you're not.</i>

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,691
<i>Mankind waits for you, with
hope, beyond the wall.</i>

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,282
â™ª

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,571
We're almost there.

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,041
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,966
What, are you afraid of heights?

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,361
No. Who told you that?

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,967
Sometimes, when I
look past the wall,

25
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,964
I think that I can see
something out there.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,248
- Do you?
- No. I don't.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,448
Maybe you need to look harder.

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,928
I am looking. I'm just not
seeing what you're seeing.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,127
When it's right in front
of your face, you will.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,410
So we're really gonna do this?

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,443
Yeah.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,847
<i>People of Chicago...</i>

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,924
<i>I know you're curious about
what's beyond the wall,</i>

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,049
<i>but sometimes walls are
there to protect us.</i>

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,489
<i>Remember, the Founders were the
ones who divided us into factions.</i>

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,924
<i>So until we know their intentions,
the wall must stay closed.</i>

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,526
<i>Jeanine is dead.</i>

38
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,126
<i>Today, we begin the trials
of her conspirators...</i>

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,602
Put the traitors on trial,
close down the gate.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,976
Didn't take her long to make
the same mistakes as Jeanine.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,480
I need to talk to her.

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,728
I still think I can
bring her around.

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,644
But that doesn't change
anything, right?

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,006
No.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,962
I need you to get
some things for me.

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,210
Just this?

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,256
You're sure you don't want
the sun and moon as well?

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,284
- I know it's a lot.
- It's impossible.

49
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
- So?
- So I'll make it happen.

50
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,046
Well, hello, ladies. Where
we going? Can I come?

51
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,521
- Give it up, Peter.
- Oh, so hostile!

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,768
There's no factions. We
can be friends, right?

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,842
Can't we all just get along?

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,806
Tris.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,647
You should be up there with all
the other leaders of the city.

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,769
No, that's not me. I don't
wanna make the rules.

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,604
Great leaders don't seek power.

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,887
They're called by necessity.

59
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,962
The people need you.

60
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,807
Look at me! Look at me! You rat!

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,645
- Back up!
- You ready to die today?

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,842
That's right! Yeah!

63
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,684
Move!

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,125
Just sit tight.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,531
String his ass up!

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,644
We all find ourselves
on new ground.

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,564
I dedicated my life
to seeking the truth.

68
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,961
But under Jeanine,
it passed me by.

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,964
And for that, I
humbly apologize.

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,166
But my personal failure

71
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,245
has only strengthened my
resolve to make things right.

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,009
While the faction of Candor
may no longer exist,

73
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,483
I want everyone to know that I will not
stop leading the pursuit of honesty

74
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,801
as we rebuild our city.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,370
Yeah!

76
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,926
Let the trials begin!
Justice will be done!

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
Yeah!

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
Yeah.

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,569
May the truth set you free.

80
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,163
Now there is no doubt, Max, that you
helped Jeanine take over Chicago

81
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,881
and exert brutal control
over its citizens.

82
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,123
So my only question
to you is this...

83
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,841
Did you feel justified in murdering
people in support of her regime?

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,601
Absolutely.

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,887
People are sheep.

86
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
They need a Shepherd
to guide them.

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,807
And when they resist,

88
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,644
they're slaughtered.

89
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,887
- Monster.
- We should slaughter you!

90
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,564
Kill him!

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,483
Yeah, kill him!

92
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,803
Kill him! Kill him now!

93
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,324
- Kill him!
- Don't kill him!

94
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,890
- Let him live!
- Kill him!

95
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,724
- Let him live!
- Kill him now!

96
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,410
Rise above it!

97
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,970
You can't do this! Stop it!

98
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,088
Let him live! We're
better than this!

99
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,083
- Rise above it!
- No!

100
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,209
Jeanine... Jeanine is dead.

101
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,602
Let's not keep her spirit alive.

102
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,682
- Kill him!
- Let him live!

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,729
What are you going to do?

104
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,842
They need an answer.

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,728
This is an execution.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,884
No. This is a trial.

107
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,441
And I yield to the
wishes of the people.

108
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,963
It is time that we
break from the past.

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,610
Yeah!

110
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,767
Kill him!

111
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,445
He needs to die!

112
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,330
- He's a murderer!
- He should die!

113
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,921
I don't wanna die.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,570
Neither did your sheep.

115
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,721
Whoo! Yeah!

116
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,321
There was a time I would've said,
"I leave you in love, not malice."

117
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,808
That time is past.

118
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,448
- Coward!
- Traitor!

119
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,002
Get out! Get out!

120
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,730
Traitor!

121
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,529
Get out, now! Get out!

122
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,046
Out, out, out, out!

123
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,610
Beatrice!

124
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,045
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,885
You incited a mob. Good
luck controlling them.

126
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,280
Beatrice, please! Don't
let them kill me!

127
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,010
Beatrice, no!

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,570
Beatrice!

129
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,328
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

130
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,289
We need to show a united front,

131
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,045
especially since Tris
refuses to stand with us.

132
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,169
- I'm not gonna tell Tris what to do.
- Well, you need to try.

133
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,121
Do you really think that you can
stop people leaving this city?

134
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,929
The wall's on total lockdown.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,810
My soldiers have orders.
No one gets out.

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,763
Why did you go to
war with Jeanine

137
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,002
if you were just
gonna become her?

138
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,649
Leaders need to make tough
decisions to protect their people.

139
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,570
You'll understand that
when you take over for me.

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,844
I'm doing this for you.

141
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,320
<i>You know, it might not be
the best time to leave.</i>

142
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,444
I know, but we can't be
here for every fight.

143
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,126
And the message said to come out
and meet the rest of the world.

144
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,170
And we know absolutely nothing
about the people who sent it.

145
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,242
But aren't you
curious to find out?

146
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,241
What about our home?

147
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,843
I don't think our
home exists anymore.

148
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,491
Maybe the way to help Chicago
is going beyond the wall.

149
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,370
And what if there's nothing out
there? What if there is nothing left?

150
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,962
I can live with that
if you're with me.

151
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,082
But I can not live
without trying.

152
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,169
You know, it's Caleb's
trial tomorrow.

153
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,651
Yeah, I know.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,731
I don't owe him anything.

155
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,769
No. No, you don't.

156
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,968
I'm gonna deal with this one.

157
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,922
Do you think I'm asking
your permission?

158
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,130
No, please, Four. No.

159
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,522
Four. Four, please, don't
kill me, I'm sorry.

160
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,604
Four, I'm sorry!

161
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,523
You tried to kill your
own sister, Caleb.

162
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,840
You brought this on yourself.

163
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,922
I'm sorry. For everything.

164
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,562
Come on. We're going up.

165
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,686
Come on, come on.

166
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,722
- Beatrice?
- Walk slowly.

167
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
Hey!

168
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,009
All Erudite prisoners are supposed
to be locked in the cages.

169
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,526
Stop!

170
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,807
I can handle this one myself.

171
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,040
Bring them in!

172
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,084
You can come out now, Caleb.

173
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,803
Thank you, Four. Thank you.

174
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,327
Don't thank me. It was
your sister's idea.

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,286
You saved me?

176
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,886
It's what you do for family.

177
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,120
Get in the car.

178
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,847
I knew it.

179
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,896
- Hey, partners.
- What are you doing, Peter?

180
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,206
Get out of here.

181
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,480
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here.

182
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,207
Look, I don't wanna be
here when your crazy mom

183
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,244
goes around killing everybody who
used to work for Jeanine, okay?

184
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,687
Look, I can join you guys,

185
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,203
or I could... yell, "Help! Help!
Hey, they're getting away!"

186
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,296
- Peter, get in the car.
- That's what I'm saying.

187
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,560
- Get in the car.
- Thank you.

188
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,203
What's up, Caleb?

189
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,402
Yeah!

190
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,802
You want the truth?

191
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,842
He's dead! Yeah!

192
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,604
Justice for all!

193
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,560
You do have a plan, right?

194
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,406
I didn't hear anything
about a prisoner transfer.

195
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,449
Well, you're hearing it from me.

196
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,290
Let me see your movement order.

197
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,966
I got it.

198
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,200
Right here.

199
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,603
I got everything,
just open the gate.

200
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,321
One more, come on,
one more! Yeah!

201
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,449
Edgar! Tobias Eaton took
Caleb Prior out of his cage.

202
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,769
Come on, let's go, now.

203
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,047
Come on, let's do some more!

204
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,444
You a statue?

205
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,851
Open the gate.

206
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,882
Did they come through here?

207
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,962
Let's get out of here.

208
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,922
They're getting away.

209
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,531
Tobias Eaton is abetting
Caleb Prior's escape.

210
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,285
That makes him a
traitor. Shoot to kill.

211
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,921
<i>Nobody goes over that
wall. We have our orders.</i>

212
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,882
- You ready?
- Yeah.

213
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,881
Not the same as reading
it in books, huh?

214
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,649
Okay, coast is clear.

215
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,363
It's time to see
what's out there.

216
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,206
Okay. On me.

217
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,923
Shit. Release now!

218
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,448
I got him.

219
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm sorry, Four.

220
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,451
Come on, come on!

221
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,770
Christina!

222
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,486
I'm okay.

223
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,648
That part of the plan, stiff?

224
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,246
Evelyn electrified the fence.

225
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,281
Ugh!

226
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,525
We did it.

227
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,731
Tori?

228
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,165
Tori!

229
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,480
Tori. Tori!

230
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,847
Tori! Oh, God. Tori?

231
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,684
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.

232
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,161
No! Tori!

233
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,166
Tori...

234
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,363
Load up! Load up!

235
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,122
All right, let's go.

236
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,171
Come on, it's this way.

237
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,450
Holy shit.

238
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,369
What happened here?

239
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,536
Didn't exactly send out the
welcoming committee for you, stiff.

240
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,130
Shut up, Peter.

241
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,521
"Humanity welcomes
you with hope."

242
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,840
What humanity?

243
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,767
This hole looks radioactive.

244
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,521
Or at least it was in
the last 200 years.

245
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,880
Meaning what exactly?

246
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,201
Somebody seriously
messed up the world.

247
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,165
Shit.

248
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,804
Great. Now the sky's bleeding.

249
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,846
This way.

250
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,367
Come on, let's go. Now, come on.

251
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,126
This is fun. I'm
glad we did this.

252
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,362
What if there's nothing
else out there?

253
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,809
There has to be.

254
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,448
I'm scared.

255
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,291
Yeah. I think that's
a good thing.

256
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,489
You guys hear that?

257
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,131
- It's an engine.
- Someone's coming for us.

258
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,801
- It's Edgar! Go, go!
- Go!

259
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,447
All right.

260
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,410
Go, go! Cut back! Go!

261
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,530
Hollis!

262
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,766
No! Hollis!

263
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,882
What?

264
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,247
Whoa! What? What is it?

265
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,256
Don't be afraid. There's
nothing to worry about.

266
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,645
You're safe now.

267
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,960
Welcome, Four.

268
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,923
Tris Prior, it's an
honor to meet you.

269
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,968
How do you know our names?

270
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,087
What the...

271
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,205
Uh-oh.

272
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,844
Welcome to the future. We've
been waiting for you.

273
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,851
Our plasma globes will protect
you from the toxicity.

274
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,680
Hey...

275
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,608
- We're gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

276
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,246
Look.

277
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,806
This is incredible.

278
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,531
This is insane!

279
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,206
Gadzooks!

280
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,880
It's Tris!

281
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,247
Welcome to the Bureau
of Genetic Welfare.

282
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,685
My name is Matthew.

283
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,650
Now, let's get you
into decontamination.

284
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
It's them from Chicago.

285
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,441
It's her. Tris
Prior. She made it.

286
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,449
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

287
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,967
<i>You're being decontaminated from
the toxins which plague our world.</i>

288
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,729
<i>Please remove your clothes and place
them in the incineration hatch.</i>

289
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,690
<i>Please step forward.</i>

290
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,651
<i>Place your feet on the mark.</i>

291
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,882
<i>You're clean. Please place your
arm into the tube in the wall.</i>

292
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,401
<i>There's nothing to
worry about, Tris.</i>

293
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,687
<i>Please place your
arm into the tube.</i>

294
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,444
I've never felt so
clean in my life.

295
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,966
That was the best weird
shower I've ever had.

296
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,929
Little cold...

297
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,923
Hey, yours is different.

298
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,291
Why are they all different?

299
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,211
<i>Hello and welcome to the
Bureau of Genetic Welfare.</i>

300
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,647
<i>In the early part of
the 21st century,</i>

301
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,530
<i>scientists first
discovered a way to map,</i>

302
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,568
<i>then edit, the human genome.</i>

303
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,529
<i>Or you can choose health.</i>

304
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,285
<i>You can choose to settle
for merely adequate.</i>

305
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,687
<i>Or you can choose excellent.</i>

306
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,401
<i>A genetic solution puts you
in control of your life.</i>

307
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,801
<i>So why just hope for
a better future</i>

308
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,247
<i>when you can choose perfection?</i>

309
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,641
<i>Choose Perfexia.</i>

310
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,963
<i>But what started as an attempt
to erase humanity's faults</i>

311
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,441
<i>almost erased humanity itself.</i>

312
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,603
<i>Genetic modification deepened
the rifts between people,</i>

313
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,809
<i>and as they got more entrenched,
the world began to tear apart,</i>

314
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,044
<i>until humanity crossed a line
from which it could never return.</i>

315
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,803
<i>In the ashes of civilization,</i>

316
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,130
<i>a small group of genetically
unmodified individuals</i>

317
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,921
<i>established the Bureau
of Genetic Welfare here,</i>

318
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,241
<i>at Chicago's O 'Hare Airport.</i>

319
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,483
<i>Our mission is to oversee
a grand experiment</i>

320
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,841
<i>to purify the human genome.</i>

321
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,527
<i>That experiment is
the city of Chicago.</i>

322
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,921
<i>Your participation
in the Bureau's work</i>

323
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,243
<i>means you are now the
guardians of the future.</i>

324
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,886
<i>Your destiny begins today.</i>

325
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,331
Now, please follow me.

326
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,642
What's an airport?

327
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,968
Life in the Bureau can be demanding,
but the work is worth every sacrifice.

328
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,280
It's them!

329
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,456
We don't have all the resources
we would like, of course,

330
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,211
but I think you'll find your
accommodations more than adequate.

331
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,016
- Whoa!
- They're in person here!

332
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,202
- Who are they?
- We bring them in from the Fringe,

333
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,647
get them healthy, give
them a second chance.

334
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,484
Hi, Four.

335
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,086
- Hi, Four.
- Hey.

336
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,003
How do they know who we are?

337
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,686
The experiment is the
entire focus of the Bureau.

338
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,205
Our surveillance technology

339
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,329
is centuries ahead of anything
you've known in Chicago.

340
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,368
They've grown up watching you.

341
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,681
Nothing creepy about that.

342
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,168
You have to forgive
everyone for staring,

343
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,131
but your arrival is the most exciting
event some of us have ever known.

344
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,163
Welcome to your new home.

345
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,250
Where's Four? Did you hurt him?

346
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,129
I told you I wanted
them unharmed.

347
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,771
He went with them. Willingly.

348
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,080
But he's alive?

349
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,085
Do you hear what I'm
saying? He betrayed you.

350
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,970
No. It's just love.

351
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,169
He's your son. He should
be loyal. I'm loyal.

352
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,041
Yes, you are. So rest up. I
need you ready to fight.

353
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,690
What do you think?

354
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,282
I think they've been studying us for
200 years and we need to catch up.

355
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,930
We're gonna give it
a chance, right?

356
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,810
Yeah. 'Course we are.

357
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,560
I wish we were alone.

358
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,281
Excuse me.

359
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,044
The director's ready to see you.

360
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,169
Yeah, er, sorry, I
meant Tris, alone.

361
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,044
We can't go together?

362
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,124
Since you were the one who opened
the box which invited you here,

363
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,202
the director would like
to thank you personally.

364
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,931
I'll see you later.

365
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,842
- Clothes.
- Thanks.

366
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,160
This way.

367
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,286
Go ahead. Put your wrist
under the scanner.

368
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,931
<i>Access granted.</i>

369
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,045
<i>Pure.</i>

370
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,771
Just never imagined the
world to be this big.

371
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,323
Ah. Chicago is just one
of 50 major cities

372
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,210
that used to exist on
th is continent alone.

373
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,081
Beyond that is oceans and more
land than you can imagine.

374
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,770
It's all like this now?

375
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,605
Yeah.

376
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,241
All except for Providence.

377
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,927
Which is why what we're doing
here is so important, Tris.

378
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,040
Hello.

379
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,769
You must be the director.

380
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,763
Oh, please, call me David.

381
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,605
It is a pleasure to
finally meet you.

382
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,682
You must have so many questions.

383
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,209
I'm a bit overwhelmed. I'm
still processing it all.

384
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,090
Oh, Tris, I know you.

385
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,889
I watched you being born.

386
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,601
I saw the love that your
mother and father had for you.

387
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,166
I watched a little girl
have a happy childhood

388
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,564
and grow into a courageous young
woman capable of making choices.

389
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,884
Dauntless. Defying
Jeanine. Saving Chicago.

390
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,008
To your people, you
are Divergent.

391
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,924
To the Council, you are a freak.

392
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,368
To me, you are a miracle.

393
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,362
David, are you aware of what's
happening in Chicago right now?

394
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,329
Of course. Yes.

395
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,926
The people at Erudite really
made a mess of things,

396
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,724
but I don't want you
to worry about that.

397
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,562
Restoring order in Chicago is as
important to me as it is to you.

398
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,530
It's the only way to
save the Damaged.

399
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,886
What is the Damaged?

400
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,009
The genetic alterations had
disastrous consequences.

401
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,650
Too brave, and you're cruel.

402
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,609
Too peaceful, and
you're passive.

403
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,762
Too smart, and you
lose compassion.

404
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,120
Like your brother.

405
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,645
Caleb's Damaged?

406
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,404
Yes.

407
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,091
For nearly 200 years,

408
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,881
the greatest scientific minds
have lived here to test a theory.

409
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,088
If we could rescue
genetically damaged people

410
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,128
from the toxic environment
in the Fringe

411
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,163
and put them in a safe
place, like Chicago,

412
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,004
then perhaps, over time,

413
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,691
man's genetic material
would heal itself,

414
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,967
return to its original form.

415
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,088
And I'm one of those people.

416
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,971
You are the only one.

417
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,136
That doesn't make any sense.

418
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,209
I mean, uh, Four is Divergent.
There's lots of Divergents.

419
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,964
Not Divergent, Tris. Pure.

420
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,761
You are genetically Pure.
The rest are still Damaged.

421
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,605
- Four?
- Damaged.

422
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,604
Not as much as
Caleb, but Damaged.

423
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,081
<i>If we can understand
what made you,</i>

424
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,642
maybe we can use that knowledge
to help the Damaged.

425
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,760
But what does this have
to do with Chicago?

426
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,922
I answer to the Council.

427
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,402
They're the ones who ultimately
determine our fate, yours and mine.

428
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,290
I'm gonna bring you with me
to Providence to meet them.

429
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,249
When they see that
it's possible,

430
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,609
<i>that you were possible, it
will change everything.</i>

431
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,763
I understand it's hard
to take my word for it.

432
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,162
But if you don't believe
me, believe your mother.

433
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,280
My mother?

434
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,727
Your mother Natalie
wasn't born in Chicago.

435
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,441
She was born in the Fringe
and rescued by the Bureau.

436
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,601
No, that's impossible.

437
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,967
See for yourself.

438
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,563
What are those?

439
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,120
They're your mother's
memory tabs.

440
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,601
With them, you can watch the
world th rough her eyes.

441
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,124
What do I do?

442
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,123
Place one on each temple.

443
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,887
Natalie! Come on!

444
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,570
I'm not Natalie.

445
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,608
We need to hide! Come on!

446
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,120
They're coming! Run!

447
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,008
The Fringers!

448
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,731
Run!

449
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,162
I'm not Natalie.

450
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,081
Natalie, no!

451
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,651
No!

452
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,246
Bureau soldiers!

453
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,000
Left! Flank left!

454
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,321
Hit right, hit right, hit right!

455
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,767
We're taking you to the Bureau.

456
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,968
You're safe.

457
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,327
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.

458
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,565
How many more did
you save today?

459
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,769
Not enough. We never get enough.

460
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,207
Chicago has got to work, David.
It's the only hope for us.

461
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,696
<i>In the ashes of civilization,</i>

462
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,645
<i>a small group of genetically
unmodified individuals</i>

463
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,566
<i>established the Bureau
of Genetic Welfare here,</i>

464
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,802
<i>at Chicago's O 'Hare Airport.</i>

465
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,928
You're safe.

466
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,970
<i>Grand experiment to
purify the human genome.</i>

467
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,883
<i>You're safe now.</i>

468
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,491
<i>Your destiny begins today.</i>

469
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,165
Tris, in a moment of need,

470
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,687
your mother did something
that no one had done before.

471
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,843
She volunteered to leave
the safety of the Bureau

472
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,729
to enter the experiment herself.

473
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,804
She did this because she knew

474
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,882
the Damaged were worth saving.

475
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,204
She believed in the experiment so much,
she was willing to be a part of it.

476
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,769
If I can show the Council your
miracle can be replicated...

477
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,764
then her life's
work is complete.

478
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,491
The Council will be forced to
look at every human being,

479
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,121
no matter where they were
born, as worthy of life.

480
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,564
Help me.

481
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,803
You saved a city.

482
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,406
Help me save the world.

483
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,082
It was amazing.

484
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,647
It was like I was her and
seeing it all through her eyes.

485
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,404
Hmm...

486
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,722
I still can't believe my
mom is from this place.

487
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,007
Well, I can see why she left.

488
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,251
Do you trust him?

489
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,480
David?

490
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,691
I trust her.

491
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,410
Yeah.

492
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,291
<i>- Access denied.
- Tris.</i>

493
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,971
<i>Access granted.</i>

494
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,167
There you are. You ready?

495
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,728
Say hi to David for me.

496
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,444
Tobias Eaton.

497
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,761
You've been assigned to me.

498
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,605
I'm Nita. Let's go.

499
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,206
Why isn't everyone
allowed upstairs?

500
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,846
That would be one of the
Council's many rules.

501
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,200
Certainly not mine.

502
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,209
This separation,
I don't like it.

503
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,244
I agree. And in time,
that won't be necessary.

504
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,450
But, Tris, I don't know who told you
that being different was a bad thing.

505
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,091
Because I know it
wasn't your mother.

506
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,246
Oh, I know I can replicate this.

507
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,243
All I need is time.

508
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,010
Look, Regina, let's talk.

509
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,562
You seem like a nice lady, but I'm
really not a desk job kind of guy.

510
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,450
I get claustrophobic. I need
to be where the action is.

511
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,162
The job of surveillance is to keep tabs
on the devolving situation in Chicago.

512
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,527
This is where the action is.

513
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,366
Hayes, this will be your pod.
Prior, you're next door.

514
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,044
Resistance is growing.

515
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,645
Evelyn is beginning to respond.

516
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,411
Watch what's happening.
File a report.

517
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,723
Wait, what? Hold on. I
just escaped from Chicago.

518
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,009
Now you're saying I gotta sit here and
watch it for the rest of my life?

519
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,366
With Caleb?

520
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,201
Perhaps you'd prefer to be
banished to the Fringe?

521
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,721
Wow, this surveillance
technology's incredible.

522
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,007
Whoever created
this is a genius.

523
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,765
Well, thank you. It
was a labor of love.

524
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,126
Ass kisser.

525
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,089
Keep it up, Prior.

526
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,251
And you, get to it.

527
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,206
Ah!

528
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,248
That's an awful
lot of firepower.

529
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,164
The Fringe is full
of dangerous people.

530
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,685
Put this on.

531
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,163
- What are these?
- Personal drones.

532
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,602
Expands your field of vision and
provides 3-D modeling of environ ments.

533
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,284
Just like old times
at Dauntless, huh?

534
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,016
Except there's nothing
old about any of this.

535
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,806
Here.

536
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,086
Thanks.

537
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,811
Activate the headgear.

538
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,406
The left hand
activates the drones.

539
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,850
Does it do anything else?

540
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,365
Not much.

541
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,330
Use the drones to
find the targets.

542
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,165
It'll take you a while
to get the hang of it.

543
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,165
Yeah.

544
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,525
Okay.

545
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,205
<i>Identified.</i>

546
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,530
<i>Target identified.</i>

547
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,682
I think I got the hang of it.

548
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,200
Hmm.

549
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,850
Can I ask you a question?

550
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,570
Yeah. Of course.

551
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,165
If my mother was
born in the Fringe,

552
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,810
then how did she
end up in Chicago?

553
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,770
I mean, you couldn't just send
her through the gate, right?

554
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,128
No. No, the Council's
always careful

555
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,336
how they introduce any new
element to the experiment.

556
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,126
Right. But when they
need to, they intervene.

557
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,929
Yes.

558
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,168
So why aren't they
intervening now?

559
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,766
Well, they will. We just
have to make our case.

560
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,208
Can I still count
on you to help me?

561
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,409
Yes. Can I count on you?

562
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,448
Jeanine never had a
chance against you.

563
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,042
The sooner we get finished, the
sooner we leave for Providence.

564
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,167
The Allegiant? That's what
you're calling yourselves?

565
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,130
Amity just doesn't seem
appropriate anymore.

566
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,362
So what exactly are
you allegiant to?

567
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,726
The faction system?

568
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,168
The factions kept Chicago
peaceful for a long time.

569
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,289
Well, I wouldn't know about that because
I was forced out of my faction.

570
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,045
I gave up my life, my
child, everything.

571
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,726
I understand your
anger, Evelyn, I do.

572
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,689
But the way forward...

573
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,444
The way forward has
already begun.

574
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,763
I know I said I'd be
alone, but I'm not Candor.

575
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,080
And I'm not Amity.

576
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,926
So I will lie and I will
fight if I have to.

577
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,604
You see these scars?

578
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,610
I wasn't born Amity.

579
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,327
And I can assure you, I'm not afraid
to fight for what I believe in.

580
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,641
Seems like we're
two peas in a pod.

581
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,041
But it doesn't have
to be this way.

582
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,726
We can come to some
sort of agreement.

583
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,164
- Get back!
- Stop! Stop!

584
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,924
- No, no!
- Get outta here!

585
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,126
All right, Caleb.

586
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,771
Keep me posted if anything
changes, all right?

587
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,288
- Hey.
- Hey.

588
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,489
Caleb said that some of the Dauntless
are lining up with Johanna.

589
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,245
But the rest of Candor is
still solidly with Evelyn.

590
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,051
Things are spiraling
out of control.

591
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,885
Has David said anything
about what he can do?

592
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,800
Well, yeah, once we talk to the
Council, then the Bureau can step in.

593
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,083
So it all hinges on the
mysterious Council, does it?

594
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,647
- What if they say no?
- David is confident that they won't.

595
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,326
David. Right.

596
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,444
You know I found out why
I can't go upstairs?

597
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,162
I'm Damaged and you're Pure.

598
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,163
I know.

599
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,169
You know. When were
you gonna tell me?

600
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,165
I don't know, I... I guess I
didn't think that it mattered.

601
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,526
Why doesn't it matter?

602
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,446
Because it doesn't make a difference
if you're Pure or if you're Damaged.

603
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,650
You're still the
same person to me.

604
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,366
Look, I know that it's not
perfect by any means,

605
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,847
but the Bureau saved my
mother from the Fringe.

606
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,216
I wouldn't be here without them.

607
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,722
What do you actually know about
what they do in the Fringe?

608
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,285
You know what they tell you.

609
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,089
- Yeah, but...
- I'm sorry.

610
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,202
He needs you upstairs.

611
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,531
He needs you upstairs.

612
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,441
The people are nice.
Weird, but nice.

613
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,046
Yeah, they're definitely
weird. That's for sure.

614
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,929
You kinda get used to it.

615
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,128
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

616
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,282
Next time you go to the
Fringe, I want in.

617
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,362
- You're not ready.
- I'm going.

618
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,524
Tris, I am more than aware

619
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,366
that the separation has been
difficult for you and Four.

620
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,647
But I've watched you
both enough to know

621
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,451
that I think the two of you
are going to work it out.

622
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,960
We're fine.

623
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,968
Everything's fine.

624
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,046
Good. Let's get to work.

625
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,680
<i>Here we go!</i>

626
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,570
Fall in, people! Weather's
clear, we are green for a run.

627
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,642
- Let's go!
- You, let's go, let's go!

628
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,256
- Move! Let's go!
- Ready to go!

629
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,120
Let's go.

630
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,644
All right, here's the
deal, listen up!

631
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,176
This may be a
humanitarian mission,

632
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,328
but the Lindale Settlement
is very dangerous.

633
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,205
- Everybody clear?
- Yes!

634
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,324
- So what is the lifespan out here?
- 25, 30 years.

635
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,768
If we get people early, they can
live up to 50 or 60 in the Bureau.

636
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,129
Dauntless, if it was up to me,
you would not be out here.

637
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,329
I know you think it was tough in
Chicago, but this is the Fringe.

638
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,243
- Understood?
- Yes.

639
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,129
Mission is to save as
many kids as possible.

640
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,964
They've grown up in
hellish conditions.

641
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,125
But you have your weapons
handy. You stick to protocol.

642
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,440
I don't wanna lose anyone.

643
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,882
Bullfrogs! Go! We're under! Go!

644
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,041
Go, go, go! We gotta move!

645
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,163
Drones!

646
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,685
Go!

647
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,922
- Help!
- Stop, stop, stop!

648
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,724
Hey, hey, hey!
Everything's okay.

649
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,529
Put me down! Please! No!

650
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,602
No! No!

651
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,371
Everything's gonna be
okay. Just follow me.

652
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,804
Uh...

653
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,691
Come on!

654
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,760
Run!

655
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,248
<i>Searching target.</i>

656
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,960
This way.

657
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,930
<i>Target identified.</i>

658
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,480
Go!

659
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,086
Stop!

660
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,811
- Stay away from us!
- Calm down. We're here to help.

661
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,016
- We don't need your help.
- I just wanna talk to you.

662
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,008
- Not gonna lose my family.
- Hey!

663
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,456
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!
- Don't!

664
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,403
Get off him! Hey,
get off my kid!

665
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,448
Get off him! Don't touch him!

666
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,489
What did you do?

667
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,166
- It's okay, it's all right.
- I wanna see my dad.

668
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,969
Four, let's go! Gotta move!

669
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,326
It's all right, it's okay.

670
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,970
Go! We gotta move,
we gotta move.

671
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,883
Let's go, come on, come on!

672
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,450
- Romit!
- Don't.

673
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,807
What the hell is going on here?

674
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,086
Just do your job, Dauntless.

675
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,406
Let's go.

676
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,640
Move!

677
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,205
Said, "Let's go!"

678
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,804
One man, two children,
down on the bridge! Go!

679
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,881
- We're here to help you!
- Go!

680
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,361
- Eyes down!
- Shut up! Look at me!

681
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,727
Hey, you, stop!

682
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,724
It's called soap.
You should try it.

683
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,723
What's up, stiff? You lost?

684
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,327
I wanted to see Four. David and
I are leaving for Providence.

685
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,721
On a first name basis
with the director, huh?

686
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,246
- You work fast.
- Peter, can you leave her alone?

687
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,570
I don't need you to defend me.

688
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,642
Attention!

689
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,296
Get us ready for Providence.
We're on my ship within an hour.

690
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,606
- Yes, sir.
- Follow me.

691
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,490
David, hey. I was wondering if I
could talk to you about my job.

692
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,602
You know, 'cause I'm not
really a typist and...

693
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,605
Or if you're busy today, I get it,
totally fine. We'll talk tomorrow.

694
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,091
Good idea.

695
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,645
I need to talk to you.

696
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,286
What is this, Nita?

697
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,011
- Vaccinations.
- What do you mean, vaccinations?

698
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,606
We weren't given vaccinations.

699
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,284
Four.

700
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,925
Look at this.

701
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,210
Hey, what's your name?

702
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,169
My name?

703
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,567
Hey.

704
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,369
I'm sorry about your dad.

705
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,925
My dad?

706
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,442
- All right, I'll see you back at base.
- Yep.

707
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,610
This is not a
humanitarian mission.

708
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,762
We're not saving kids.
We're stealing them.

709
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,366
This is what we
do. Now you know.

710
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,489
David takes them out from here,
wipes their memories with the gas,

711
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,210
and raises them in the Bureau.

712
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,816
If you take away what they know,
then you take away who they are.

713
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,083
Yeah. I think that's the point.

714
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,762
They were all unarmed.

715
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,250
I won't surrender to this.

716
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,091
Round up everyone who's left.

717
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,401
We take the fight to Evelyn.

718
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,482
Yeah, I'm loading up.

719
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,165
We're moving.

720
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,803
Today we take Evelyn down.

721
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,405
Whatever it takes.

722
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,209
Yeah!

723
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,331
This is all real time.

724
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,136
I mean, the surveillance technology
they have in place is extraordinary.

725
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,208
Caleb, can you get out of
your head for a second?

726
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,921
This is our home. And
there's gonna be a war.

727
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,521
Where are you going?

728
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,602
I'm gonna do something about it.

729
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,123
Four! What are you trying to do?

730
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,486
<i>Access denied.</i>

731
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,086
I'm getting Tris. We're leaving.

732
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,764
You can't go up there.

733
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,444
- What do you think you're doing?
- Four.

734
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,249
- You cannot be in here.
- Four.

735
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,288
<i>- It's not gonna work.
- Pure.</i>

736
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,442
Central elevator's
been compromised.

737
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,888
- Hey. What?
- We're leaving. Right now.

738
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,405
What? I can't.

739
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,689
Look, you don't understand yet, but
these people have been lying to you.

740
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,205
Lying? What are you
talking about?

741
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,766
Look, whatever they've told
you, they have been...

742
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,808
Put the guns down.

743
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,451
He has been stealing children
from their families.

744
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,936
- We're giving them a better life.
- By killing their parents?

745
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,088
It was an unfortunate
accident, sir.

746
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,604
One terrible accident doesn't mean
it was the wrong thing to do.

747
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,808
Tris, this is not the place
that we thought it was.

748
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,689
If you had enough
to save one person,

749
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,043
and your choice was between a
healthy child or a sick old man,

750
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,043
- who would you choose?
- I wouldn't choose.

751
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,600
Good. Now they're both dead.

752
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,251
We have to go.

753
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,203
Tris, we're going back to Chicago.
We should never have left.

754
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,647
- No, we have to wait.
- No, we've been waiting, okay?

755
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,563
David is not the person
that you think he is.

756
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,056
Four, you know
nothing about David.

757
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,976
You've no idea what we've
been working on up here.

758
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,445
What have you been working on?

759
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,409
Do you have any idea what
is going on out there?

760
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,760
Yes, of course I do.

761
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,127
Why do you think we're going
to meet with the Council?

762
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,440
Tris...

763
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,251
I want you to listen to me.

764
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,891
Tris.

765
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,251
You're coming with me.

766
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,091
I have to go.

767
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,045
You're making a mistake.

768
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,483
You ready?

769
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,724
Yeah.

770
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,246
<i>Autopilot engaged.</i>

771
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,765
If you wanna go back to
Chicago, I'll take you.

772
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,080
No, thanks.

773
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,403
You're gonna walk across the
Fringe? I don't think so.

774
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,803
There's no rule saying you
can't go home, Four. Come on.

775
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,722
- Yeah.
- I'll come with you.

776
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,846
All set!

777
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,008
Take us to Chicago.

778
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,886
Look, I understand how you're
feeling, but what you're about to do

779
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,170
has ramifications for
people all over the world.

780
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,245
If Four doesn't see that,
it's not your fault.

781
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,644
David never wanted you to see
what you saw out on the Fringe.

782
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,131
He keeps tight control.

783
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,168
Nothing happens
without his approval.

784
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,006
And his ship is the only one that
can fly through the camo wall.

785
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,726
Why are you telling me this?

786
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,804
We're not taking you to Chicago.

787
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,286
Hold on!

788
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,763
Welcome to Providence.

789
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,764
I see why they don't
want to share.

790
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,411
Someday the whole world's
gonna look this beautiful.

791
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,160
So, as you can see,

792
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,005
there are multiple genetic markers
supporting this conclusion.

793
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,684
Standard personality tests.

794
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,967
Behavioral evaluations.
Stimulus response.

795
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,646
She's passed them all
with flying colors.

796
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,530
It all sounds great,
assuming it's the truth.

797
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,365
- Phillip...
- David has lied to us before.

798
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,603
Haven't you, David? I'd
like to hear from the girl.

799
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,365
Well, I don't know why. She can't
tell you anything I'm not.

800
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,851
Indulge us, David.

801
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,924
This must all come as quite
a shock to you, Miss Prior,

802
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,002
finding out that you're Pure.

803
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,969
Um...

804
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,884
"Pure." I'm not even sure
what that's supposed to mean.

805
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,611
But, yes, it is shocking to me.

806
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,523
Shocking that the more I
learn about the past,

807
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,525
the more I feel like you're all making
the same mistakes over and over again.

808
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,250
Tris, this is not the way.

809
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,129
Let her speak, David.

810
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,963
What mistakes, Tris?

811
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,520
Human beings can not be
categorized in this way.

812
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,648
It doesn't work.

813
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,121
Maybe it's time to start
embracing everyone

814
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,046
instead of dividing
them into groups,

815
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,726
regardless of whether they're
Pure or they're Damaged.

816
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,376
That isn't what we're
here to discuss.

817
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,607
Well, it should be!

818
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,002
Look, I know that all of this
is just an experiment to you,

819
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,606
but these people in
Chicago are real.

820
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,644
And they are in a war right now
because of divisions that you created

821
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,484
and you are doing
nothing to help them.

822
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,002
David has control over the
administration of Chicago.

823
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,601
He's only here to
extend his funding.

824
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,284
Which we would be happy to do,

825
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,971
but if things are as bad
as she says, David,

826
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,611
shouldn't you get your
house in order first?

827
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,401
You said that you
couldn't do anything.

828
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,084
I am doing something.

829
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,288
I'm bringing back the factions.

830
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,488
What? Why?

831
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,410
I hoped the Allegiant would take
care of the problem for me.

832
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,689
The factions work, Tris.
They keep the peace.

833
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,762
They created you.

834
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,251
I never should've trusted you.

835
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,483
You want change
with no sacrifice.

836
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,484
You want peace with no struggle.

837
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,562
The world doesn't
work like that.

838
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,451
You okay?

839
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,047
I'll be fine. The
Bureau isn't far.

840
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,406
I need to get to Chicago.

841
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,410
Tell Evelyn she's got a lot
bigger problems than Johanna.

842
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,891
Yeah.

843
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,129
You'll need this to get
through the camo wall.

844
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,965
We need your help, Tobias.

845
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,566
You don't know what
he's capable of.

846
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,527
What about Tris?

847
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,400
As long as she stays in
the Bureau, she's safe.

848
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,925
She's too valuable to him.

849
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,164
I'll need a head start.

850
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,324
So when David asks,

851
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,847
I want you to tell him that
I left you behind. Okay?

852
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,160
Why?

853
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,766
Because then Tris will
know you're lying.

854
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,009
There was an accident.

855
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,645
There was turbulence.

856
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,324
Not more than any
other storm, but...

857
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,482
Lightning, maybe.

858
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,365
- We just went down.
- Where's Four?

859
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,448
I don't know. I passed out.

860
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,889
When I came to, everyone was
dead. Four left me behind.

861
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,611
Okay, we search the
settlements, search the Fringe.

862
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,011
Make sure he's not there.

863
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,566
Don't worry, we'll
find him. I promise.

864
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,570
Four would never leave anyone
behind at the crash site.

865
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,689
Yeah. He told me you
would say that.

866
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,048
Four's trying to make his
way back to Chicago.

867
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,170
Peter.

868
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,969
Hello, David.

869
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,883
I didn't think that
you knew my name.

870
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,203
I know all of the important
people from Chicago.

871
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,925
Really?

872
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,128
Well, if I'm so important,

873
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,249
then why did you give
me such a terrible job?

874
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,563
We all have to make sacrifices.

875
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,722
I don't see you making any.

876
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,365
Peter...

877
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,886
I need help with
something in Chicago.

878
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,327
What's in it for me?

879
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,847
Well, if you do well, you
can have any job you want.

880
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,245
Except mine.

881
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,248
Do you know where Peter is?

882
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,086
- Um... He's not in his pod?
- No.

883
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,491
No, I don't know where he is.

884
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,090
Is-is there something
that I can help you with?

885
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,889
Can you find Four?

886
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,081
You can't tell anyone.

887
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,162
Okay, of course.

888
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,691
Anything you need, Beatrice.

889
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,482
Come on, Four, where are you?

890
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,363
Evelyn.

891
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,046
We found him outside the wall.

892
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,804
Take it off.

893
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,489
Where's my son?

894
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,168
I don't know.

895
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,043
Edgar told me what's out there,

896
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,324
so you better start talking or
we'll be holding your trial now.

897
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,448
No, you won't.

898
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,126
Because I have something
that you need.

899
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,090
Really? And what's that?

900
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,129
The way to win your war.

901
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,083
- Hey.
- Hey.

902
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,288
Any news?

903
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,805
No.

904
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,447
- I'm sorry.
- Tris...

905
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,921
- Did you find him?
- Yes, I found Four.

906
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,401
And there's something else
you're gonna wanna see, too.

907
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,082
Okay, go.

908
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,080
<i>Over there!</i>

909
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,202
That's him! We got him!

910
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,045
Four.

911
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,408
Don't worry, he's fine.
Just keep watching.

912
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,925
What is this place?

913
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,604
You're gonna love it.

914
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,480
What is it?

915
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,927
Try it out. You'll see.

916
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,084
Just don't try it
on anyone you like.

917
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,443
I was wondering when you'd
have the courage to face me.

918
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,763
Three weeks you leave me here.

919
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,649
I ran a faction!

920
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,564
I protected our son
from Jeanine's thugs.

921
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,083
Protected him? Is that
what you call it?

922
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,322
Beating your own child!

923
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,088
It made him who he is.

924
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,769
Make sure he gets a good dose.

925
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,528
<i>Tobias... I'm just trying
to help you to be better.</i>

926
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,131
I'm s... I'm s...
I'm sorry, but...

927
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,962
Who are you?

928
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,766
Huh...

929
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:10,247
Just imagine if you released
this on the Allegiant.

930
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,370
Not even Johanna will remember a
time that you weren't in charge.

931
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,044
Who exactly told you about this?

932
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,249
You have a very powerful
friend on the outside

933
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,130
if you choose to engage
instead of prepare.

934
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,726
- Does this friend have a name?
- David.

935
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,246
<i>- David?
- You can tell my friend</i>

936
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,085
I'm not gonna use that thing
unless it's a last resort.

937
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,124
Why would David support Evelyn?

938
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,521
Doesn't make any sense.

939
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,087
Are you okay? I was
worried about you.

940
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,056
Evelyn, you need to make
peace with the Allegiant.

941
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,003
No. Johanna made her choice.

942
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,971
I never wanted this war, but I
will end it, I promise you.

943
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,691
You have no idea what you're up
against. Johanna is not the issue.

944
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,567
Look, I know you're angry at
me and I understand that.

945
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:10,288
I'm just... I never meant...

946
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,523
This is hard for me, too. I don't
wanna have to keep you in here.

947
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,688
Then let me out.

948
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,928
I can't. I have
responsibilities.

949
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,766
One day you'll understand that, but
right now I need you to stay here.

950
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,969
I'm gonna finish this.
One way or another.

951
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,526
How are you gonna finish this?

952
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,847
Hey, don't worry. You won't
have to be here for long.

953
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,201
What... What are
you talking about?

954
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,089
Well, Evelyn's deciding now.

955
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,801
If she uses the memory serum,
Chicago might forget its own name.

956
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,085
We have to go.

957
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,481
Get Christina and
meet me outside.

958
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:39,880
Where are we going?

959
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,326
Home.

960
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,731
<i>Access granted.</i>

961
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,005
How's it going in Chicago?

962
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,811
Making sure it's safe from
Evelyn and the Factionless?

963
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,168
Tris, you need to
forget about Chicago.

964
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,576
You know, it's
really funny, David.

965
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,440
You've been watching me for years and
you don't know anything about me.

966
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,930
You're wiping the memories of
everyone in Chicago, aren't you?

967
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,286
All right, uh, no...

968
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,896
You were never supporting
the Allegiant.

969
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,561
These people treated you terribly.
They killed your parents!

970
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,880
Four is there!

971
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,361
Four. Yes, yes, Four is there.

972
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,841
But he's Damaged, just
like the rest of them.

973
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,850
Where are you going?

974
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,843
I'm taking your ship and
I'm not coming back.

975
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,127
You can't fly.

976
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,440
Watch me.

977
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,086
<i>Autopilot engaged.</i>

978
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,884
Tris Prior is stealing my
craft. Bring her back.

979
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,166
Hurry.

980
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,720
Christina.

981
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,936
- These are for you and Tris.
- How'd you know we were leaving?

982
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,089
You're not the only
ones who hate David.

983
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,605
- Okay, come on.
- Thank you.

984
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:31,365
- Hold it!
- Get in, get in.

985
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,363
Hands to yourself
or I throw you out.

986
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,011
Let's go rescue Four.

987
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,726
Looks like three ships
are following us.

988
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,416
<i>- Plasma craft engaged.
- Surround it.</i>

989
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,736
Give her a nudge
towards the ground.

990
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,888
The autopilot will
bring her down safely.

991
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,160
Whoa!

992
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,362
What are they trying to do?

993
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,329
They're trying to bring
us in for a landing.

994
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,130
I'm going manual.

995
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,531
Tris!

996
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,565
Pull up! Pull up!

997
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,484
Trying. I'm trying!

998
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,891
<i>Altitude.</i>

999
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,126
I got it.

1000
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,363
<i>Your orders, sir?</i>

1001
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,124
Shoot her down.

1002
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,123
Before she reaches
the camo wall.

1003
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,804
You can't follow her through.

1004
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,851
We're dead.

1005
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,400
We're gonna die, we're gonna
die, we're gonna die!

1006
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,571
Hold on!

1007
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,329
It's gonna be close.

1008
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,727
There has to be a way
to shut off the gas.

1009
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,280
Look at the ventilation system.
It's all over the city.

1010
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,771
Down there.

1011
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,126
Johanna.

1012
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,202
We got here just in time.

1013
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,250
It's time, Evelyn.

1014
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,450
You said the gas
was a last resort.

1015
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,451
Well...

1016
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,649
How do you think your
trial is going to end?

1017
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,561
Let me know the second
the serum is released.

1018
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,563
You got it. Good luck.

1019
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,085
Thank you.

1020
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,364
How do these drones work?

1021
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,885
Turn your headgear on.

1022
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,011
And?

1023
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,650
Watch and learn.

1024
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,041
Stop right there!
Drop your weapons!

1025
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,930
Hey. Hey, whoa,
what are you doing?

1026
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,566
Put me down!

1027
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,684
All right, this one's all you.

1028
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,962
- Easy!
- Sorry.

1029
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,491
Stay where you are!

1030
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,210
That's my girl.

1031
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,891
Recon!

1032
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,927
Screw this! I'm outta here.

1033
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,247
What the hell is that?

1034
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,720
Hey.

1035
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:29,121
Hey... I'm sorry.

1036
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,122
I never should have trusted him.

1037
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,885
You were doing what you
thought was right.

1038
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:41,641
I love you.

1039
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,203
We should find Evelyn.

1040
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,210
Come on.

1041
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,251
<i>Ready.</i>

1042
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,967
Now, if you press that button...

1043
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,444
We're completely safe
inside the vault.

1044
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,887
And no one else will ever
know what happened to them.

1045
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,722
Your choice.

1046
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,762
<i>Initialize serum vaporization.</i>

1047
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,286
<i>Guys!</i>

1048
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,488
Guys! They just
initiated the serum.

1049
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,847
Did you find a way
to shut it off?

1050
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,207
Come on.

1051
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,611
Not yet.

1052
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,682
This way.

1053
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,089
It's locked.

1054
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,536
I'll see if I can get in
from the control room.

1055
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,847
Evelyn, you have to
stop this right now.

1056
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,524
I...

1057
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,923
I didn't wanna do
this, but I have to.

1058
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,048
I'm the only one who knows
how to save Chicago.

1059
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,091
I was right to close the gate,
but no one listened. No one!

1060
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,964
Not even you.

1061
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,243
The Allegiant brought
this on themselves.

1062
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,483
Evelyn, that serum is not just gonna
wipe the memories of the Allegiant.

1063
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,050
It's gonna do it
to the whole city.

1064
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,884
What?

1065
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,803
Whatever they told
you was a lie.

1066
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,529
Oh, God...

1067
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,721
- Oh, God.
- Evelyn...

1068
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,201
I wanna stand by your side.

1069
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:02,641
But what you do to the
city, you do to me.

I won't know who you are.

1073
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,520
Don't do it.

1075
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,451
Go.

1076
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,123
No!

1077
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:44,487
That's why you pick a guy
like me for a job like this.

1078
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,530
I hope you're watching, David!

1081
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,444
Once it's locked from the
inside, the door won't open.

There's a choke point where
the vapor gets pumped out.

Cut their com line to the ship.

1093
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,006

Peter, open the door!

1100
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,531
I will find you, Peter.

1101

Tris, look at this,
it's really smart.

1110
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,324
So they ran the piping
through the air ducts.

1111
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,482
Caleb, focus. Just
tell me where it is.

1112
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,296
It's right here. There's an isolation
valve that controls the flow of the air.

But I don't know how you're

01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,526
Close the door.

1118
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,411
<i>Tris? I control everything.</i>

1119
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,721
<i>I can even seal the room
you're in right now.</i>

1120
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,564
Just stop fighting.

1121
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,847
<i>There's another way.
Down the stairs.</i>

1122
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,485
<i>This is foolish. Just stop.</i>

1123
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,846
I made you.

1124
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,287
<i>You might as well be my child,</i>

1125
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,442
<i>which is what
you're acting like.</i>

1126
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,126
A spoiled child.

1127
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:24,040
<i>Tris, at the end of the hall,
there's another way up the ladder.</i>

1128
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,762
<i>It's over, Tris.</i>

1129
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,211
<i>Searching target.</i>

1130
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,920
<i>Searching target.</i>

1131
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,410
<i>Searching target.</i>

1132
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,042
<i>Target identified.</i>

1133
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,602
There you are.

1134
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,686
<i>You're right,
David. It is over.</i>

1135
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,484
No!

1136
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:16,886
<i>Serum release halted.</i>

1137
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,930
How's that for Damaged?

1138
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,730
<i>Clear.</i>

1139
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,602
It's clear.

1140
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,802
<i>Clear.</i>

1141
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,211
<i>Clear.</i>

1142
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,449
We did it.

1143
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,687
It's what you do for family.

1144
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,926
<i>Caleb, there's one more
thing I want you to do.</i>

1145
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,526
<i>I wanna send a message to David.</i>

1146
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,410
<i>My name is Tris Prior.</i>

1147
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:43,490
<i>And I'm here to
reveal the truth.</i>

1148
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,961
<i>There are others who
exist on this planet.</i>

1149
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,929
<i>They do not view us as equals.</i>

1150
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,367
<i>They call themselves the Pure</i>

1151
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:53,444
<i>and they call us the Damaged.</i>

1152
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,490
<i>They created a wall to
divide us from their world</i>

1153
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,450
<i>and factions to divide
us from each other.</i>

1154
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,882
Hello? Come on!

1155
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:08,884
You think you can
ditch me like this?

1156
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,281
Get me to do your dirty work

1157
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:15,285
and then just wipe me away
like the rest of them?

1158
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,328
We had a deal, pal!

1159
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,529
<i>We were their experiment and
it almost destroyed us.</i>

1160
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:24,286
I set the autopilot right for
our friend's neighborhood.

1161
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,922
Along with a little surprise for when
it goes through the camouflage wall.

1162
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:38,648
<i>They tried to make us forget who
we are and where we 're from,</i>

1163
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,688
<i>but they did not succeed.</i>

1164
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,129
<i>So here we stand. Together.</i>

1165
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,170
<i>Not as five factions,
but as one city.</i>

1166
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:51,050
<i>And we're gonna tear
down their wall.</i>

1167
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,969
I want the penthouse!

1168
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,044
Yeah! That's right!

1169
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,803
Or a room in that really
cool upstairs area.

1170
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,362
Okay, look...

1171
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:23,808
I'll even take my old bunk back.

1172
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:27,930
Just come on and
open the damn door!

1173
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,526
Please!

1174
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,531
<i>You've seen us.</i>

1175
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:51,126
<i>And now, we see you.</i>

1176
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:00,449
<i>To those of you beyond the
wall, hear me loud and clear,</i>

1177
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,522
<i>because I know you're listening.</i>

1178
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,366
<i>Chicago is not your experiment.</i>

1179
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,329
<i>It is our home.</i>

1180
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,971
And it always will be.

1181
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:26,442
