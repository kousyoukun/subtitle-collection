1
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,598
Heads up! Good defense!

2
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,028
Good defense.

3
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,786
We're going downtown.

4
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,599
Shut the hell up...

5
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,103
...you stupid mutt.

6
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:20,964
What do you want?

7
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:26,044
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
I have a package for you.

8
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,778
It sounds broken.

9
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:35,616
Most likely. I'll bet it was something
nice. This is an insurance form.

10
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,746
If you'll just sign here,
here, and here...

11
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,552
...initial here,
put your name here...

12
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,459
...we'll get the rest of
the forms to you soon.

13
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,466
That's a lovely dog.

14
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,036
- Do you mind if I pet him?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

15
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,679
Oh, brother.

16
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,884
That's fine, I can finish the rest.

17
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:07,882
Have a good day. Take care.
Bye-bye.

18
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,437
Excuse me, HDS!

19
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,505
HDS, coming through!

20
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,005
Got a package, people!

21
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,951
Get away from the door.

22
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,596
What's the matter with you?
I said, get!

23
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,727
Son of a bitch!

24
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,835
That was a close one,
ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,064
Unfortunately...

26
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,738
...in every contest
there must be a loser.

27
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,914
Loohooserrhher.

28
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,648
Hungry?

29
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,657
There you go.

30
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,560
No problem. It gets flooded,
we'll just wait a few seconds.

31
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,737
Or we can try it now.

32
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:36,964
Putz!

33
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,270
Come on!

34
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,811
Get out! Get out!

35
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,675
Assholes are closer than they appear.

36
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,855
Give me a push while you're there.

37
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,722
Alrighty, then.

38
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,064
It's alive!

39
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,069
It's alive!

40
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,546
Oh, my little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?

41
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,289
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
I won't let him. No, I won't.

42
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,588
He can keep the big TV, but he's not
going to hurt my baby, no he's not.

43
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,227
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.

44
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,566
How can I ever repay you?

45
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,739
The reward would be good.

46
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,867
There is some damage to my car,
and I had to fill it with premium.

47
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,277
Would you like for me
to take your pants off instead?

48
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,650
Gee... Let me think.

49
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,756
Sure!

50
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,290
People are real friendly around here.

51
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,477
Ventura?

52
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,288
Yes, Satan?

53
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.

54
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,122
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.

55
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,289
You owe me rent.

56
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,437
Mr. Shickadance, I told you,
you're my first priority.

57
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,070
I'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.

58
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,343
Look at that. That's an albino pigeon.

59
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,914
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.

60
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,016
As soon as I find this bird...

61
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,284
...you're paid.

62
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,952
I heard animals in there.

63
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,954
I heard them again this morning,
scratching around.

64
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,282
I never bring my work home with me.

65
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,521
What's all this pet food for?

66
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,797
Fiber.

67
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,763
Want to look inside? Come on!

68
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,767
Come on!

69
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,985
Go ahead, snoop around.

70
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,326
Well?

71
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,331
Are you satisfied?

72
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:10,103
Just don't let me catch you
with an animal in here.

73
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,603
All right.

74
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,106
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

75
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,447
Loser.

76
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,400
Come to me, jungle friends.

77
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,659
Roger, let me ask you one question!

78
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,395
How the hell do you lose
a 500-pound fish?

79
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,400
Sorry, I was just going to say...

80
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,062
...it's not a fish, it's a mammal.

81
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,872
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.

82
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,009
She didn't mean anything by that.

83
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,513
I don't give a good goddamn
about that fish.

84
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,050
Fillet it if you want to.

85
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,683
All I give a damn about is
winning the Super Bowl.

86
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,550
At the least, I've got to have
their heads in the right place.

87
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,127
Shit, you've been in this business
a long time...

88
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,365
...you know how superstitious
these players are.

89
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:46,028
The quarterback has put his socks
on backwards since high school.

90
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,404
I've got a linebacker that hasn't
washed his jockey strap in two years...

91
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,373
...because he thinks flies are lucky.

92
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,378
I want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.

93
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,040
Find the fish...

94
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,947
...or find new jobs!

95
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,021
Why did it have to happen now,
two weeks before the Super Bowl?

96
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,091
I'll tell you who did it.
It's those animal-rights activists.

97
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,122
Always out with their signs:

98
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,431
"Animals were born free,
stop torturing Snowflake."

99
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,462
It lives better than we do.

100
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:19,536
The police are checking into the animal-
rights groups. Have they called back?

101
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,073
No, but I wanted to tell you,
when I lost my Cuddles...

102
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,075
...I hired a pet detective.

103
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,576
A what?

104
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,445
A pet detective.

105
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,719
Thanks, Martha, but we better
leave this to professionals.

106
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,145
Well, actually, he was quite good.

107
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,949
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

108
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,345
Like a glove!

109
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,585
Mr. Ventura here to see you.

110
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,723
Thanks. Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.

111
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,098
Pleased to meet you.

112
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,125
Did you get any trouble getting in?

113
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:01,429
No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

114
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,831
Security's tight, Super Bowl week.

115
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,677
Have a seat. I'll get
right to the point.

116
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,305
Our mascot was stolen from his tank
last night.

117
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,612
Are you familiar with Snowflake?

118
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,116
Negative.

119
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,823
We got him from the Miami Seaquarium.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.

120
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,117
This is one of the new tricks
he was going to do at half-time.

121
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,650
Let's go.

122
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,723
Blue 42, blue 42.

123
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,128
Hut, hut!

124
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,670
All right!

125
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,876
Come on, let's go!

126
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,810
Good boy!

127
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,450
Want an ashtray?

128
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,160
I don't smoke.

129
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,432
It's a disgusting habit.

130
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,766
The police came today.

131
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,631
Apparently, the kidnappers
came in through the back gate.

132
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,801
They said, some kind of a...

133
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,812
Four-wheel drive van,
loaded from the rear.

134
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,307
How you holding up?

135
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,350
If I'm walking funny it's because
I have two dozen reporters up my ass.

136
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,355
They've been asking me
about Snowflake all morning.

137
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,652
Who's he?

138
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,423
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.

139
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,358
He's our pet detective.

140
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,568
Nice to meet you, you were highly
recommended by Martha Mertz.

141
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,832
Martha Mertz?

142
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,932
Oh, yeah, the bitch.

143
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,842
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
Half-dead when I found her.

144
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,512
Is that the tank?

145
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,577
Excuse me.

146
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,827
- Cops drain it?
- Yes, this morning.

147
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,891
If I'm not back in five minutes...

148
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,699
...just wait longer.

149
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:32,656
Captain's log, Star Date 23.9, round
it off to the nearest decimal point.

150
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:37,419
We've traveled back in time to save
an ancient species from annihilation.

151
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,655
So far...

152
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,757
...no signs of aquatic life,
but I am going to find it...

153
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,667
...if I have to tear this universe
another black hole.

154
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,503
I've got to, mister!

155
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,720
Oh, great.

156
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,856
I'll try to head them off.

157
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,294
Ace, get out of the tank.

158
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,951
I just can't do it, Captain.

159
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,364
I don't have the power.

160
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,857
People!

161
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,631
I said, get out of the tank now!

162
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,401
For God's sake, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a pool man.

163
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,972
Where's Snowflake?

164
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,436
Snowflake is not available right now.

165
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,914
I've been waiting all day.
I must get a shot of his new trick.

166
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,647
Is he sick?

167
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,348
People, people.

168
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,722
How can I get the work done
mit all the shouting?

169
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,324
What's wrong mit ze shouting?!

170
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,626
Who the hell is that?

171
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:48,728
That's...

172
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,869
Heinz Gezwellwert,
I'm trainer of dolphins.

173
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,373
You want to talk to the dolphin,
you talk to me.

174
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,371
What happened to the regular trainer?

175
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,804
Vhat happened to him?
Vhat happened to me?!

176
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,773
It's seven years
I'm making the grade.

177
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,852
We are making the dolphins disappear,
und then Roy is coming...

178
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,513
...mit the vhite tiger,
und the stuffing in the pants...

179
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,554
...und I'm gone!

180
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,957
Where is Snowflake?

181
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,457
Why do you care about Snowflake?
Do you know him?

182
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,859
Does he call you at home?
Do you have a dorsal fin?

183
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,733
To train the dolphin you must think
like the dolphin.

184
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,872
You must be getting unside
the dolphin's head und communicating.

185
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,601
I'm saying to Snowflake...

186
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:32,875
Und he is saying...

187
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,904
Und he is up on the tail...

188
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,510
Und you can quote him!

189
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,814
All right, it's just about time
for Coach Shula's press conference.

190
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,922
So why don't I take you folks
over that way and let... Heinz...

191
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,427
Go to the conference.
Go to it.

192
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,633
Lassie must be missing.

193
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,908
Make any good collars lately?

194
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,776
Or were they leashes?

195
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,385
Homicide, Ventura.

196
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,786
How are you going to solve that one?

197
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,392
Good question, Aguado.

198
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,864
First, I'd establish a motive.

199
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,802
Here, the killer saw the size of the
bug's dick and became insanely jealous.

200
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,968
Then I'd lose 30 pounds...

201
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,840
...porking his wife.

202
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:15,775
Oh, you!

203
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,472
Come on.

204
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,641
Now kiss and make up.

205
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,882
Excuse me...

206
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,755
...l'd like to ass you a few questions.

207
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,696
This is not the time, Ace.

208
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,630
If Einhorn come down here and see me
talking to you or your ass, I'm history.

209
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,929
I can keep him under control. You must
tell me who's on the Snowflake case.

210
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,773
I can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.

211
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,438
All right, that's it.
Now, it's my turn.

212
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,879
Five minutes alone, that's all I need.

213
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,814
Better look alive,
Einhorn's on her way down.

214
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,717
Come on, now. Please.

215
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,154
What's the matter,
afraid I'll make a stink?

216
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:01,959
Come on.

217
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,627
Aguado's working the case, all right?

218
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:05,888
Aguado.

219
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,563
Good call.

220
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,668
Look, we're a little busy now...

221
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,862
...with murderers and burglaries and
drug dealers and things like that.

222
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,975
A missing dolphin isn't exactly
a high priority.

223
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,710
Now you've pissed him off.

224
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,976
- You'll get me in trouble.
- I can't hold him much longer!

225
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,480
My boss is coming.

226
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,618
Okay, look.

227
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,556
We checked with local
animal-rights groups.

228
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:39,823
We checked out the taxidermists and
we already checked on van rentals.

229
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,297
So far, nothing, nathan, nada.
All right?

230
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,736
Any unusual bets being made?

231
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,963
Of course, this is the Super Bowl.

232
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,798
- What'd you find out about the tank?
- Nothing unusual.

233
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,268
Some tire tracks, an escape route,
and a guard that didn't see anything.

234
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,945
- That's it?
- That's it.

235
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,574
Now will you please get out
of here before I get in trouble?

236
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,720
Thank you for your cooperation.

237
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,850
By the way, do you have a mint?

238
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,324
Perhaps some Binaca?

239
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,572
"Assholomio...

240
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,740
"...Osodomia..."

241
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,618
Holy testicle Tuesday!

242
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,313
What the hell is he doing here?!

243
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,190
I came to confess.

244
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,887
I was the second gunman
on the grassy knoll.

245
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:50,030
Spare me the routine, Ventura. I know
you're working the Snowflake case.

246
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,265
May I suggest you yield
to the experts on this one?

247
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,732
We'll find the porpoise.

248
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,177
Now I feel better.

249
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,642
Of course, that might not do any good.

250
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,352
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
A dolphin's been taken.

251
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,349
A common porpoise has
an abrupt snout...

252
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:15,684
...and pointed teeth, while
the bottle-nosed dolphin...

253
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:21,257
...has a long beak, round, cone-shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal fin.

254
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,231
But I'm sure you already knew that.

255
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,102
That's what turns me on about you...

256
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,633
...your attention to detail.

257
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,239
Listen, pet dick...

258
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,370
...how would you like me
to make your life a living hell?

259
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,739
Well, I'm not ready
for a relationship, Lois...

260
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,916
...but thank you for asking.

261
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,723
Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.

262
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,192
Your number still 911?

263
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,227
Alrighty, then.

264
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,703
Excuse me. Is Greg here?

265
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,838
Thank you.

266
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,489
What's the password?

267
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,298
New England clam chowder.

268
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,427
Is that the red or the white?

269
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,736
I never remember that.

270
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,831
White?

271
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:14,911
Hey, Woodstock.

272
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,408
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?

273
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,241
Super, thanks for asking.
I hope you're having a lovely day.

274
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,410
Do you?

275
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:23,880
Don't I?

276
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,881
So what are you up to?

277
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,459
Just watching the fishes, manoshevitz.

278
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,991
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.

279
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,232
I'm sending them
new directional coordinates.

280
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,259
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...

281
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,305
...before they find any whales.

282
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,805
Gravy. So can you still...

283
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,502
...tap into the aquatic supply stores?

284
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,244
Of course. Why?

285
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,507
To trace the sale of any equipment...

286
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,784
...for moving or housing
a dolphin recently.

287
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,978
Come on, I thought you
had a challenge for me.

288
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,849
All right, we've got marine winch,
sling, feeder fish 20,000-gallon tank...

289
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,258
Wait a minute, look here.

290
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,359
That's a lot of equipment
for a civilian.

291
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,461
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

292
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,265
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.

293
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,837
Really?

294
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,511
That is the face of the enemy.

295
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,510
Always trying to get his greedy
hands on endangered species.

296
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,442
Camp is connected with the Dolphins?

297
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:32,250
That's some genius, gave them
the land the stadium's built on.

298
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:37,426
And look, he's throwing another "I'm
the richest man in the universe" party.

299
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,493
Looks like it's time for me
to get myself a date.

300
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,602
I'm going out on a limb here.

301
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,343
Camp's social events are
strictly A-list.

302
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,010
The date started well, but she
tensed up before we got to the party.

303
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,345
If you do anything embarrassing...

304
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,420
What? Like this?

305
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,487
Hi, Captain Stubing.

306
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,325
How are Gopher and Doc?

307
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,000
Permission to come aboard, sir.

308
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,986
I'm sorry, ladies.

309
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,657
- Melissa.
- Hi Ron.

310
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,925
Glad you could come.

311
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,658
Thank you.

312
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,322
You look wonderful.

313
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,331
And who is he, a friend?

314
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,497
This is my date.

315
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,002
He's a lawyer.

316
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,346
Well, does he have a name,
or should I call him "Lawyer"?

317
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,344
I'm sorry. This is Ace V...

318
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,320
Tom Ace.

319
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,584
Pleased to meet you.

320
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,984
Congratulations on all your success.

321
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,523
You smell terrific.

322
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,660
One of the first things we learned...

323
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,263
...back at...

324
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:27,370
...Stanford was about the growth of food
poisoning claims against wealthy people.

325
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,265
One could make quite
a lucrative law practice...

326
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,536
...with little else.

327
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,971
How is everyone feeling tonight?

328
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,617
Very, very well, thank you.

329
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:41,976
Look, honey...

330
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,714
...there's the hors d'oeuvres.

331
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:45,682
See you.

332
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,623
Are you insane? There is no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

333
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,925
What are you trying to do?

334
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,007
Just keep him occupied while
I work my magic, please.

335
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,511
Smooshy, isn't it?

336
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,296
We got a few cases from
my new dealer in Paris.

337
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,728
Excuse me...

338
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,193
...I need to use the bathroom.

339
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,528
I think it's the pate.

340
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,501
Sure, it's over there.

341
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,406
Stuff probably looks better
on the way out.

342
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,377
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.

343
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,645
Gravy.

344
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,082
Don't worry, Snowflake.

345
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,858
Ace Ventura's here.

346
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,624
Yummy.

347
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,284
Snowflake.

348
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,279
Here, Snowflake.

349
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,624
I've got a snack for you.

350
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,773
They're wonderful aren't they?

351
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,576
Yes, they certainly are.

352
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,639
No matter what's going on in my life...

353
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,805
...I can watch them swim...

354
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,613
...and be totally at peace.

355
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,621
It's not Snowflake.

356
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,927
It's not Snowflake.

357
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,829
It's not Snowflake!

358
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,252
Are you sure your date is all right?

359
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,354
It's been a very long time.

360
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,786
Who, Tom?

361
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,318
Well, I'm sure he's fine.

362
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,240
Do not go in there.

363
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,221
I'm sorry. I'll have the plumbing
checked immediately.

364
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:51,886
Do that. If I had been drinking out
of the toilet, I might've been killed.

365
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,422
I'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.

366
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,635
What're you doing?

367
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,468
I'm sorry, Ron.

368
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,870
What's he doing?

369
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,571
Let's go!

370
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,472
Stop it.

371
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,847
I don't even want to know
why your pants are missing.

372
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,615
I don't care what happened to you.
You could've cost me my job.

373
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,253
So you found a pebble in
Snowflake's tank. I'll call CNN.

374
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,520
I found it in the filter, thank you.

375
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:29,325
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare,
triangular cut, orange amber.

376
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,632
What're you talking about?

377
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,898
Tonight I saw the same stone
in Camp's ring.

378
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,534
I thought you said Camp didn't do it.

379
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,406
No, Camp's clean,
his ring wasn't missing a stone.

380
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,413
But whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his.

381
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,482
Ring? What ring?

382
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,480
The 1984 Dolphin AFC Championship ring.

383
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,359
I find the ring
with the missing stone...

384
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,894
...I find Snowflake.

385
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,761
How will you do that?

386
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,432
Simple.

387
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,541
Loser!

388
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,043
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?

389
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,343
You want to play?

390
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,552
Damn it.

391
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,135
That stone could be from anywhere.

392
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,098
It could've come from...

393
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,039
...a necklace or a pendant, an earring.

394
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,674
It came from an '84
AFC Championship ring.

395
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,552
Einhorn thinks it may have been an
animal-rights group.

396
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:13,883
Do you know FAN?

397
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,591
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea,

398
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,057
daughter of industrialist
Fisher Gamble?

399
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,255
Over half-a-million members worldwide?

400
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,499
No. Who are they?

401
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,594
Did you know that last year
they sent 127 threatening letters...

402
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,899
...demanding the release
of team mascots?

403
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,674
What do you feed your dog?

404
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,511
Dog food. Why?

405
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,113
He is miserable.

406
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:38,906
What are you talking about?!

407
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:43,312
He's just very unhappy, I feel sorry for
him. Bad diet, isolated environment...

408
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,622
...it's amazing he's alive.

409
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,822
You're just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didn't work out.

410
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,596
You can't express anger.

411
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,526
Yeah? And you're ugly.

412
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,169
I'm not even going to talk to you.
Please leave.

413
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,306
Why? So you can beat him?

414
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,608
Fatty.

415
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,041
You're unbelievable.

416
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,203
Hiring you was a big mistake.

417
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,343
Well, why don't you cry about it?
Saddlebags.

418
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,855
You like her, huh?

419
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,587
Yeah, she's all right.

420
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,892
Look, Melissa, I...

421
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:40,837
I am here at the North Beach Towers,
a condo complex in north Miami...

422
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,807
...where Roger Podacter, Head of
Operations for the Miami Dolphins...

423
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,179
...has apparently committed suicide.

424
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:51,219
Allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th-story apartment...

425
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,788
You okay?

426
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,658
I told you, I was in my apartment...

427
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,097
...across the hall.

428
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,332
I heard a scream...

429
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,607
...so I called the manager.

430
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,611
The place was empty, except for the dog.

431
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,304
I opened the balcony door
and looked out.

432
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,678
Splat, bang, pancake time.

433
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,841
Okay, thank you very much.

434
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,724
Hi, there.

435
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,258
Have a bad night?

436
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,330
So...

437
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,866
...animals can sense evil.

438
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,909
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

439
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,736
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.

440
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:54,817
This is police business. We'll let
you know if the coroner finds a tick.

441
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,677
Face it...

442
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,882
Forget it, she's right.

443
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,114
Besides...

444
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,753
...I wouldn't want someone tracing
my steps, pointing out my mistakes.

445
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,743
So...

446
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,747
...you don't think this is an
obvious suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

447
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,687
I wouldn't say that. There's
evidence here to support your theory.

448
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,882
Except, of course, that spot
of blood on the railing.

449
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,290
I'll tell you what I think happened.

450
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,764
Alrighty, then. Roger Podacter...

451
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,895
...went out after work,
had a few drinks, then came home.

452
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:51,908
But he wasn't alone. Someone else
was with him. There was a struggle...

453
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,767
...and he was thrown over that balcony.

454
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,345
Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide.

455
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,408
He was murdered.

456
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,346
That's a very entertaining story...

457
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,787
...but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called...

458
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,489
...evidence.

459
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,124
I think I heard a toilet flush.

460
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,492
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.

461
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,534
Well, I...

462
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,739
...guess I'm out of my league.

463
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,310
Good work.

464
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,513
There is just one more
thing, lieutenant.

465
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,392
This woman is Roger's neighbor,
she lives across the hall.

466
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,119
She said she heard a scream.
Right?

467
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,232
And you said you had to open
the balcony door when you came in?

468
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,927
- That's true.
- You're sure you had to open this door?

469
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,363
I'm sure.

470
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,473
What's the point, Ventura?

471
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,139
Only this.

472
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,290
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...

473
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:19,190
...that neighbor could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down.

474
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,593
She heard screaming from in here...

475
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,299
...before he was thrown over
the balcony.

476
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,835
The murderer closed the door
upon going.

477
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,931
Can you not feel that, honey?

478
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,372
I have...

479
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,345
...exorcised the demons.

480
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,985
This house is clear.

481
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,150
- Losers.
- Get him out of here!

482
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,855
- Losers! Losers!
- Let's go, Ace.

483
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,621
Losers.

484
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,365
Come on.

485
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,363
Back to the zoo.

486
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,095
What're you thinking?

487
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,205
This whole thing is connected somehow.

488
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,276
I want to find that other ring.

489
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,374
Ace, you checked all the rings.

490
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,847
Receipts? What about receipts?

491
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,585
There's got to be receipts.

492
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:29,257
That was pretty impressive,
what you did back at the apartment.

493
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,525
You don't have to tell me.

494
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,533
I was there.

495
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,507
Maybe you should've
become a real detective.

496
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,644
I don't do humans.

497
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,545
You really love animals.

498
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,213
If it gets cold enough.

499
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,655
No, I have a kinship with them.

500
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,457
I understand them.

501
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,428
Want to hear something spooky?

502
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,698
One time when I was about 12, I had
this dream I was being followed by...

503
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,933
...a dog with rabies.

504
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,174
He had bloodshot eyes...

505
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,174
...and foam came out of his mouth.

506
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:19,448
No matter how fast I ran, he just
kept gaining on me, gaining on me.

507
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,518
Then just before I got
to my front door...

508
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,389
...he jumped and sank his teeth in.

509
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,360
That's when I woke up...

510
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,430
...and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.

511
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,299
Bastard.

512
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,301
I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.

513
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,707
Want to know why I do this?

514
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,666
I'm not sure that I do.

515
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,468
You better be...

516
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,441
...because once you're inside my head...

517
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,616
...there's no turning back, baby.

518
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,297
So...

519
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,460
...are these all the receipts?

520
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,695
Maybe it's in another file in the back.

521
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,570
Who the hell is that?

522
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,366
What?

523
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,469
That.

524
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,314
Who the hell is that?

525
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,343
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?

526
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,721
Why isn't he in this picture?

527
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,419
This was taken earlier in the year.

528
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,260
Ray Finkle wasn't added
until mid-season.

529
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:51,302
He missed the final field goal
in the Super Bowl that year.

530
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,204
Cost the Dolphins the game.

531
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,637
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?

532
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,307
Definitely.

533
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,382
"Replacement kicker
having a great year."

534
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,719
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."

535
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,088
"The kick heard 'round the world."

536
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,526
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.

537
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,464
Poor guy.

538
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:21,126
Poor guy with a motive, baby.

539
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,733
Where is he now?

540
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,400
Last I heard, he went back
to his home town, Collier County.

541
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,606
Really?

542
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,309
You'll drop me off
before you go, right?

543
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,777
No way, you shouldn't
be alone right now.

544
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,622
It might not be safe at your apartment.

545
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,324
What do you suggest?

546
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,266
Oh, my God.

547
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,640
Oh, my God.

548
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,209
Three times.

549
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,343
Sorry, that's never happened before.

550
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,751
I must be tired.

551
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,252
Okay, I'm ready again.

552
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,310
I'm looking for Ray Finkle...

553
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,311
...and a clean pair of shorts.

554
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:47,415
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

555
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,613
Soccer-style kicker. Graduated
from Collier High, June 1976.

556
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:56,624
Stetson University honors graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.

557
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,421
Most points and distance.

558
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,496
Former nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.

559
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,566
And one hell of a model American.

560
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,305
Are you another one of
them "Hard Copy" guys?

561
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:14,410
No, sir.

562
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,307
I'm just a big Finkle fan.

563
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,315
This is my Graceland, sir.

564
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,248
Put that gun down.

565
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,280
The boy is a fan of our son.

566
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,654
So nice to meet you.

567
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,487
I'm Ray's mother...

568
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,458
...and this is Ray's father.

569
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,793
It's a real honor.

570
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,501
It's an honor to have you here.

571
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,273
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.

572
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,807
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

573
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,370
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

574
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,275
Oh, yes, I expect him home any minute.

575
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:56,241
Would you like some cookies?
I just baked them.

576
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,851
Yummy.

577
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,487
Ray Finkle's house.

578
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,425
I can't wait to meet him.

579
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:14,367
Ray ain't coming home.

580
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,374
Your wife expects him any minute.

581
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,033
She expects him home any minute.

582
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,809
See, the engine's running
but there's nobody behind the wheel.

583
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:28,575
Eight years ago...

584
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,745
...our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.

585
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,991
And they're still bugging us
to pick up his stuff.

586
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,760
It was all that Dan Marino's fault,
everyone knows that.

587
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,491
If he had held the ball laces out,
like he's supposed to...

588
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:46,033
...Ray wouldn't have missed that kick.

589
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,634
Dan Marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell.

590
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,742
Would you like a cookie, son?

591
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,044
What do you know?

592
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,446
They're little footballs.

593
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,015
Laces out.

594
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,487
When Ray comes back
and starts kicking again...

595
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,022
...he'll never even know he was gone.

596
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:11,093
I've kept his room
just the way he left it.

597
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,014
Oh, boy.

598
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,019
What a sports nut, huh?

599
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:50,766
May I?

600
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,069
Oh, yes, by all means.

601
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,868
Five seconds to go
in this Super Bowl 17.

602
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,771
Dolphins trailing the 49ers...

603
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,411
...by one. This will
win the game for Miami.

604
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,776
There's the snap.

605
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,380
Marino holds.

606
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,678
The kick...

607
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,445
...and it's high. No, it's...

608
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:14,647
...no good.

609
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:18,387
Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal.

610
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,662
I don't believe it!

611
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,759
Dolphins lose.

612
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,462
The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl.

613
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,433
- Melissa, it's Ace.
- Where are you?

614
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:35,066
I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's
the mayor. Where's Marino?

615
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:36,642
Why?

616
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,841
Because he's about to join Snowflake.
I must know where he is!

617
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,450
He has a commercial shoot
at the Bogart Sound Stage.

618
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:47,714
Call the police,
get extra security over there now.

619
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,821
Ace, what's going on?

620
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,118
Thought I left?

621
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,032
I'm really going this time.

622
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,737
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.

623
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:09,979
Action.

624
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:14,550
I'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows
the value of protection, it's me.

625
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,516
So I take care of the hands
that take care of me...

626
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,525
...with Isotoner gloves.

627
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,630
Cut. Again from the top.

628
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:28,991
I said, cut.

629
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,530
It's a cut.

630
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,067
What the hell are they doing?

631
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,827
That's a cut!

632
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:36,639
Let's go!

633
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,601
- What is this, a rewrite?
- Shut up!

634
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,544
- Where'd they go?
- Over there!

635
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,650
Let's go!

636
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,594
Excuse me, gentlemen.

637
00:54:58,695 --> 00:54:59,753
Pet detective.

638
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:10,970
What's wrong?!

639
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,608
Can't you hit me?

640
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,134
Have there been ransom demands?

641
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,706
There's been no communication
with the kidnappers.

642
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,808
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?

643
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,743
The game is on, as scheduled.

644
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,779
Why weren't we told about Snowflake?

645
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,073
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk public interference.

646
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,277
- Are the crimes related?
- I'm sorry, I can't comment further.

647
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,346
If you'll excuse me.

648
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,755
Get me Podacter's autopsy.

649
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,058
Aguado, send out a memo:
no one talks to the press.

650
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,366
Someone, get me coffee!

651
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,759
Tonight on "Miami Vice,"
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!

652
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,142
When I get out of that bathroom,
you'd better be gone.

653
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,812
Is it number one or number two?

654
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,306
I want to know how much time I have.

655
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,319
By the way, I went
ahead and solved that...

656
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,621
...pesky Snowflake-Podacter-Marino
thing.

657
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:38,055
Yeah, you ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

658
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,665
All right, Ventura...

659
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,231
...make it quick.

660
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,670
I found a rare stone at the
bottom of Snowflake's tank.

661
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,811
It belongs to a Dolphin '84
AFC Championship ring.

662
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:59,081
The Super Bowl when Finkle
missed the kick.

663
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,149
Blames it on Marino.

664
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:06,085
We're talking paranoid, delusional
psychosis. I saw the guy's room...

665
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,622
...cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.

666
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,726
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

667
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:17,030
My guess is Finkle was snooping around.
Podacter recognized him. End of story.

668
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:21,797
As for Snowflake, he was given Finkle's
number, taught how to kick a field goal.

669
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,766
Finkle took it personally.

670
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,076
So where is Finkle now?

671
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:32,681
Busted out of a mental institute. He's
been plotting his revenge for years.

672
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,683
Waiting for the perfect time
to get back at the Dolphins.

673
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,719
The time when it'd hurt them most:

674
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,014
Super Bowl time.

675
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,417
Man, I'm tired of being right.

676
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,427
Congratulations.

677
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,700
You've done some fine detective work...

678
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:55,802
...Ace.

679
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:00,035
I'm sorry, could you speak
into my good ear?

680
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,370
I thought I heard you call me Ace.

681
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:07,476
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you're more than just a pet dick.

682
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,318
Your gun is digging into my hip.

683
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,059
What's wrong?

684
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,687
Want me to read you your rights?

685
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,324
Maybe later.

686
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,733
What is it?

687
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,438
That bony little bitch...

688
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,401
...Melissa Robinson?

689
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,212
You just don't do anything for me.

690
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,077
Down, boy!

691
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,017
Everything okay in here?
I heard some commotion.

692
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,016
Fine, sergeant.

693
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,119
Should I throw him out?

694
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,385
Why don't you throw yourself out?

695
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,490
Yes, ma'am.

696
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,735
Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.

697
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,234
I can't do that, lieutenant.
I was hired to find Snowflake.

698
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,171
When we find Marino...

699
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,333
...we'll deliver Snowflake.

700
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,739
When I find Snowflake...

701
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,011
...l'll deliver Marino.

702
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,092
Melissa, it's Ace.

703
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,556
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.

704
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,201
You have to commit me.

705
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:38,070
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have some of his stuff.

706
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,336
They won't let us just look around.

707
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,568
I know.

708
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:45,007
It's a good thing
I'm a master of disguise.

709
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,172
Mrs. Robinson...

710
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,350
...l'm Dr. Handly. Hi.
- Hi.

711
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,179
Now who is it you want us to look at?

712
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,481
My brother...

713
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,381
...Larry.

714
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,395
I'm ready to go in, Coach,
just give me a chance.

715
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,465
I know there's a lot riding on it,
but it's all psychological.

716
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,399
Just must stay positive.

717
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:11,564
I'm going to execute a button-hook
pattern, Super slo-mo.

718
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,136
Let's see that...

719
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,896
...in instant replay.

720
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,448
Your brother won't be
the first football pro here.

721
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:04,457
- Is that right?
- Yes, we're very sensitive...

722
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,256
...to the stress athletes must endure.

723
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,365
I'm open! I'm open!

724
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:10,856
I'm open!

725
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,331
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...

726
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,598
...but I think he'll fit in nicely here.

727
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,564
Over here!

728
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,373
3-50-1!

729
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,604
3-50-1!

730
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,050
Rover, sit. Hut, hut.

731
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,188
He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game.

732
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,889
Has he a history of mental illness?

733
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,057
As long as I've known him.

734
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,591
This is one of our therapy rooms.

735
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,895
And we do arts and crafts
out here in the courtyard.

736
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:53,141
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another...

737
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,639
Half-time!

738
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:12,526
He'll be fine there by himself
for the next 20 minutes.

739
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,598
I'll show you the dormitories then.

740
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,136
Isotoners.

741
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:51,723
Obsess much?

742
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,192
Where are you going?

743
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,357
- To clean the storage room.
- No, clean the cafeteria.

744
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,468
I don't tell you how to do your job...

745
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,433
The schedule says...

746
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,336
...clean the cafeteria.
- I know what I'm doing, understand?

747
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,669
You should've cleaned it earlier.

748
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:10,239
Man, come on. Look, cafeteria,
my ass. I'm cleaning in here.

749
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:11,676
Your breaks are too long.

750
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,048
Man, you're a pain in the ass.

751
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,302
"Search called off for missing hiker."

752
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:43,370
"A search ended today
when rescue workers...

753
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:47,277
"...were unable to find
the body of Lois Einhorn..."

754
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,186
A hiker missing since Friday?

755
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,685
Lois Einhorn?

756
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,689
Holy shitballs.

757
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,303
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work.

758
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,198
Love, Roger?

759
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,576
Ace, it's "E".

760
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:57,174
You think the article
you found was something?

761
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:59,619
I got a note from Podacter to Einhorn...

762
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,351
...thanking her for a wonderful evening.

763
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,221
Something ain't stirring
the Kool-Aid, man.

764
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:07,228
Wiggles, rewind.

765
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,894
What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle?

766
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,302
Come on, think!

767
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,409
Finkle and Einhorn in it together.
How? Why?

768
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,243
All right. Here we go.

769
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:33,582
Answer's right there!
Must get blood to the brain.

770
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,985
Finkle and Einhorn. Finkle and Einhorn.

771
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,590
Finkle and Einhorn. Finkle and Einhorn.

772
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:54,907
Quitter.

773
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,980
What do you want?

774
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,950
I don't have any food for you.

775
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,283
I have to have money to buy food.

776
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,949
I have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?

777
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,493
Let's face it...

778
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,000
...your master is a loser.

779
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,920
What the...?

780
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,654
That's it.

781
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,486
That's it!

782
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,393
Einhorn is Finkle.

783
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,934
Finkle is Einhorn.

784
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,566
Einhorn is a man!

785
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,007
Oh, my God!

786
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,011
Einhorn is a man!

787
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:02,034
Your gun is digging into my hip.

788
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,405
God.

789
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,544
And the big story
in this Super Bowl game...

790
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:10,838
...is the abduction...

791
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,938
...of Miami's starting
quarterback, #13, Dan Marino.

792
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,143
It must be a strain on
this Miami team, Bob.

793
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,158
What's wrong? Aren't you having fun?

794
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:03,090
I just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?

795
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,626
A magical afternoon...

796
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,194
...where dreams are made...

797
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,938
...and crushed.

798
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:15,042
If you want tickets,
you're going about it the wrong way.

799
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:20,040
Do I look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if...

800
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,446
...we've met someplace before?

801
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,483
I don't know.
I get hit in the head a lot.

802
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,949
Now the coin toss.

803
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,056
Kickoff time.

804
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:32,517
My favorite thing.

805
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,725
Laces out!

806
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:02,747
I made some refreshments, Dan.

807
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,194
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?

808
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,462
I'll be right back, Dan.

809
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:45,064
I don't know how much Psycho Woman's
paying you but I'll double it.

810
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,261
Sorry, Danny boy.
Psycho Woman keeps us out of prison.

811
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,563
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.

812
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,504
Check it out, Marino.

813
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,735
I'm throwing passes to a dolphin.

814
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,122
Damn.

815
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,018
Go get some more fish.

816
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,091
I could kill it.

817
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,719
Lovely party.

818
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,724
Pity I wasn't invited.

819
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,245
Where the hell are the smelts?

820
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,145
Unconscious.

821
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,289
Exactly as I planned.

822
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,598
What the hell was that?

823
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,642
Shit!

824
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:09,272
What happened?

825
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:11,276
What's going on?

826
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,687
You okay?

827
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,348
Guess what?

828
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,020
It's nap time.

829
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,325
What a hit!

830
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,125
Heads up!

831
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:31,934
Who are you?

832
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,306
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
I've been sent with a special play:

833
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,140
The "quarterback sneak."

834
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,215
Penalty.

835
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,108
Too many men on the field.

836
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,212
I warned you, Ventura.

837
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,422
Whatever happened to Ace?

838
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,316
Good question.

839
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:55,325
Be careful with that phone.
In time, you could develop a tumor.

840
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,361
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einhorn.

841
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,329
Send some men over
to the Hallandale Yacht Basin.

842
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,201
I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse.

843
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,136
It's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

844
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,210
Code 11 in progress,
343 Victorville Road...

845
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,011
...at the Palmdale Basin.

846
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,384
Officer needs backup.
Suspect's name: Ace Ventura.

847
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,383
Should be considered
armed and dangerous.

848
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,753
It's Ace. We got to break out of here.

849
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,764
Is he in trouble?

850
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,364
Don't worry, if there's
one thing I know...

851
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,966
...there's nothing Ace can't handle.

852
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,771
Don't kill me.

853
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,071
Please.

854
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,969
I'll never tell anyone, I swear.

855
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,377
- He's who you want! Kill him!
- Kill him!

856
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,378
- He held the ball, remember?
- Kill him, he's the detective.

857
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,277
Come on, look at him.

858
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,786
- Crybaby.
- Jock.

859
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,056
- Wimp.
- Musclehead.

860
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,714
Shut up!

861
01:14:57,025 --> 01:15:01,223
I think I'll kill the dolphin first.
I wouldn't want you to miss that.

862
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:03,454
And there's the snap.

863
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:04,899
The kick!

864
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,034
And it's good!

865
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:10,069
Good to see somebody who
doesn't buckle under pressure.

866
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,508
What do you know...

867
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,412
...about pressure?

868
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,313
Well, I have kissed a man.

869
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:27,914
Of course, there's never been a more
crucial kick in a Super Bowl...

870
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,285
...than the kick heard 'round the world.

871
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:35,726
I mean, it's clear to me that it was
a good hold. Finkle just booted it.

872
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,396
The laces were in!

873
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,467
They were in!

874
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,389
Oh, you like that?

875
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,923
You like that?!

876
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,231
And that! And that!

877
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,204
Having a little trouble with the lady?

878
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,105
You don't understand...

879
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:27,407
...she's a...

880
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,385
Get him, Lois! Get him!

881
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,588
Get him!

882
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,096
Get!

883
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,365
Shoot him!

884
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:49,470
- Shoot him!
- Hold your fire!

885
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:52,373
Don't shoot!

886
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:55,065
Put your guns down or this cop gets it.

887
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,240
I mean it!

888
01:16:58,513 --> 01:16:59,980
She's not joking!

889
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,547
He kidnapped Snowflake!

890
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:05,214
He killed Roger Podacter and
was about to kill Marino and...

891
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,378
...me!

892
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,986
Fiction can be fun.

893
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,096
But I find the reference section
much more enlightening.

894
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,592
For instance...

895
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:18,226
...if you looked up...

896
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,996
...professional football's
all-time bonehead plays...

897
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:27,000
...you might read about a Miami Dolphin
kicker named Ray Finkle...

898
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:31,578
...who missed a 26-yard field goal in
the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.

899
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:38,452
You wouldn't read Finkle was
committed to a mental hospital...

900
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:42,148
...escaped, and joined the police
under the identity of a missing hiker...

901
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:45,488
...manipulating his way to the top
in a scheme to get even with Marino...

902
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,960
...whom he blamed for the entire thing!

903
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,094
What are you talking about?

904
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:55,396
She's not Lois Einhorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

905
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:56,935
He's lying!

906
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:58,265
Shoot him!

907
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,402
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?

908
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:08,905
Would a real woman have to wear
one of these?

909
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,947
Boy, that's really on there.

910
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,020
But tell me this:

911
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,058
Would a real woman...

912
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,323
...be missing these?

913
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,564
That kind of surgery can
be done over the weekend.

914
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,139
But I doubt very much...

915
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:38,342
...if he could find the time
during his busy schedule...

916
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:40,071
...to get rid of...

917
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,239
...big old...

918
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,112
...Mr. Knish!

919
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,354
Oh, boy.

920
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,554
Come here.

921
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:00,297
Would you excuse me
for just one second?

922
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,306
Ladies and gentlemen...

923
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,980
...my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...

924
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:16,982
...brought new evidence to my attention.

925
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,086
Now...

926
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:22,322
...history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive...

927
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,324
...criminal investigator can be wrong
from time to time.

928
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,552
But, if I am mistaken...

929
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:31,099
...if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman...

930
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:33,494
...as she claims to be...

931
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,099
...then, my friends...

932
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:40,173
...she is suffering from the worst
case of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!

933
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:43,503
That's why Roger Podacter is dead!

934
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:46,280
He found Captain Winkie!

935
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:56,524
Good night!

936
01:19:56,825 --> 01:20:00,192
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.

937
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,799
Die, animal boy!

938
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,496
Quick decision.

939
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,188
Loser!

940
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:41,564
Do you have any more gum?

941
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:46,204
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.

942
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:49,475
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.

943
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:53,477
Ladies and gentlemen...

944
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:55,480
...the Miami Dolphins are proud...

945
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,610
...to welcome back to
Joe Robbie Stadium...

946
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,411
...our beloved mascot...

947
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,389
...and the star of our halftime show:

948
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,356
Snowflake!

949
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,492
And now...

950
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:18,301
...returning for the second half, the
Miami Dolphin's most valuable player:

951
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,599
Dan Marino!

952
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:07,515
Idiot!

953
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:13,492
Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.

954
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,789
Yeah? Blow me.

955
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:18,863
Really?

956
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,874
The National Football League...

957
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,419
...would like to offer
a special thank-you...

958
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,886
...to the man who rescued Dan Marino...

959
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,547
...and our beloved Snowflake.

960
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,657
A great humanitarian...

961
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,190
...and a lover of all animals:

962
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,261
Mr...

963
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:50,387
...Ace... Ventura!

964
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,900
Excuse me!

965
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:56,860
Get off me!

966
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:05,811
Tone, put that big-ass size 13 on
and kick it for the homies.
