1
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:08,408
What have you got there?

2
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:11,953
God!

3
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,874
Baxter?

4
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:11,471
He got our dog!

5
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:15,934
He got Baxter!

6
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:27,404
Shut up, Norman.

7
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:33,301
Can this happen to a normal woman?

8
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:45,547
Baxter's fertilizer.

9
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:50,087
And everyone's just
standing there like...

10
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,488
staring.

11
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:56,891
Why don't they just
catch that thing?

12
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:03,489
How hard could it be in a
place full of dead ends?

13
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,141
Fuck!

14
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,403
Wrists are for girls...

15
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:11,489
I'm slitting my throat.

16
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,917
You should definitely hang.

17
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:17,920
Maybe even your final moment
is a cliché around here.

18
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,416
Not ours. B, ours will rock.

19
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:25,386
You don't think our deaths should be a
little more than cheap entertainment?

20
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:30,099
You jazzed me on this.
Don't wuss out now.

21
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,846
It's the idea of everyone
staring at me just lying there.

22
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:39,108
I mean, what if they just... laugh?

23
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,486
They'll be in awe.

24
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,865
B, suicide is like the
ultimate "fuck you".

25
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:49,736
Come on it's so us. It's the pact.

26
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:53,331
See, it's easy for you.
You don't care.

27
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:56,292
We swore we'd go together,
one way or another.

28
00:03:56,293 --> 00:04:00,163
- When we were eight.
- So?

29
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:05,668
Out by sixteen or dead in this
scene, but together forever.

30
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,052
Together forever.

31
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:20,350
United against life as we know it.

32
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:23,978
Us dead will be the
shit, B. Trust me.

33
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,536
Too much blood.

34
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:44,499
- And I can see your gonch!
- Just do it.

35
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:12,581
All right, all right... uh.

36
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:16,492
Well that was completely...

37
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:19,070
..disturbing, wasn't it?

38
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:23,407
You know, the Fitzgerald
sisters clearly worked very...

39
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,626
God!

40
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,294
I mean I, I...

41
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:30,081
I am completely sickened.

42
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:35,086
Sickened... by that, wasn't I?

43
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,717
Look, see me in the guidance office,
after class, you two, separately.

44
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:45,229
Can we see the ones
of Ginger again?

45
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,480
Enough!

46
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:47,807
Hey!

47
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:51,853
Life in Bailey Downs, huh?

48
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,646
Who's next?

49
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:08,452
Oh yes, ladies, run. Run for daddy!

50
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,581
Bounce.

51
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,343
I bet she's good to go.

52
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,929
- You wanna do a Fitzgerald?
- You're kidding?

53
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,433
Not the little dweeb, you goinks.
The one with the rack!

54
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,176
The redhead.

55
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:25,845
Odd.

56
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:29,307
I think McCardy just checked me.

57
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,939
Like you care, right?

58
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:40,826
High school is just a mindless
little breeders machine.

59
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:43,696
A total hormonal toilet.

60
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,366
I'd rather wait it
all out in our room.

61
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,795
- What is with your back?
- I don't know.

62
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:55,583
Hey, 'Search and Destroy'. Go.

63
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:03,090
OK, Trina Sinclair.

64
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:09,472
Excellent selection. Continue.

65
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,900
Trina Sinclair, D.O.A.
at the hair dye aisle.

66
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:17,154
Perished while seeking matching barrettes
on nothing but diet pills and laxatives.

67
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,490
Likes her shorts stuck
up her ass crack.

68
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:22,576
Favorite homework excuse:
my nail glitter ate it.

69
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:24,620
Basic pleasure model.

70
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:30,076
Your standard,
cumbuckety date bait.

71
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,120
Good one.

72
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:37,083
- Line change. Let's go, girls.
- Fucking Bitch!

73
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,559
Uh oh.

74
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:48,135
Let's do this again.

75
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,264
I'll cover you.

76
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:54,975
Good.

77
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,868
Bounce, babies,
bounce! Keep running.

78
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,829
You want it baby.

79
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,955
C'mon, honey!

80
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,698
Oh yeah, baby!

81
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,203
- You want it, baby.
- Fuck off!

82
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:21,760
'The Beast of Bailey
Downs' strikes again.

83
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,554
That's four dogs this week.

84
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:26,098
Oh! Wow... Bonus!

85
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:29,393
I guess you're D.O.A.
on a dog. Huh, Fitz-face?

86
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,470
That's enough.

87
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:34,440
- Are you OK?
- Terrific.

88
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,317
That is one mother-fucking mad dog.

89
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,062
Brigitte, go get cleaned up.

90
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,658
Don't ever touch my sister again.

91
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:47,444
Stop me, freak.

92
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,241
Enough! Break it up!

93
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:10,642
Hey, that janitor was looking
right down your shirt.

94
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:11,969
Sure.

95
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:15,147
Want me to kill her?
I'll kill her for you, B.

96
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:16,807
Whatever.

97
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:22,112
No, not whatever.
This isn't whatever.

98
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:25,282
Seriously, what about torture?

99
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,776
Anything you want.

100
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:33,207
Or... she has that dog.

101
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:38,587
We could kidnap it, make it look like he
got eaten by 'The Beast of Bailey Downs'.

102
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:41,548
We got all that blood and fake
guts from the slide show.

103
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,710
Yeah, that's wicked. Let's do it.

104
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,137
She screws a drug dealer; she's
begging for negative attention.

105
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,981
So, Sam are you...
are you gonna call me?

106
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,733
OK, you have my number, right?

107
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:03,562
Remember when I gave
it to you, before?

108
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:05,230
Sam.

109
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:07,107
OK, bye...

110
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,485
Let's get up.

111
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:13,789
Such a dickhead.

112
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,748
See...

113
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:18,043
You'd let idiots get away
with fucking you up.

114
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,836
That's why the big Buddha made me.

115
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:21,797
To stop them.

116
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:23,757
Yeah, so far you're
really kicking ass.

117
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:27,886
Just give me one clean shot.
Just one, I fucking promise you.

118
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:31,840
- Don't humor me!
- So, Fitz...

119
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:34,635
I think we should get together.

120
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:41,934
No.

121
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,399
Bitch!

122
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:53,362
Jump, Norman. Come on.

123
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:56,331
B...

124
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:58,667
Just say you won't
go average on me.

125
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:01,253
Just 'cause some gonad
gets his zipper going?

126
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:03,213
Rather be dead.

127
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:09,010
- I'd rather die than be here without you.
- Relax, you're not, you big suck.

128
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:12,297
Ginger, don't push your sister.

129
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:16,343
God, I hate our gene pool.

130
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:19,054
Look, girls.

131
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,810
Come on. Let go. Let go.
You're ruining it!

132
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,697
Ginger, why are you
rubbing your back?

133
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:40,500
- It hurts.
- Why?

134
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:46,840
Well, pain flows up your nerve endings
to the synapses in your brain...

135
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,925
She's not funny.

136
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:53,172
- How did you hurt it?
- Being dead.

137
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,601
Does it hurt down by your tail
bone, or is it up higher?

138
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:01,480
- Is it tight throughout here?
- Maybe.

139
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:04,308
Does it ache back here?

140
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:08,187
- Might...
- Oh my god.

141
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:12,616
Do you think it's cramps?

142
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,660
Give it a rest... for two seconds?

143
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:17,287
Pam, we're eating.

144
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:20,457
Henry, the girls are both three
years late menstruating. OK?

145
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,375
It's not normal. If it's
finally happening...

146
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,585
It's not!

147
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:27,756
Honey, it's nothing to be scared of.
It's the most normal thing in the world.

148
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,217
- Maybe it's cancer of the spine.
- Ginger-Ann...

149
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,003
Or tuberculosis.

150
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:35,889
- See what your attitude does?
- Or spondylitis.

151
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,434
- Spondo... what?
- Fuses your vertebrae together.

152
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,311
- Nice.
- Brigitte, stop it.

153
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:42,354
Have a fit!

154
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:44,189
I've had just about
enough of that tone.

155
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,943
- That makes two of us. Fuck!
- That's it. To your room!

156
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:49,686
Gladly.

157
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:56,026
Brigitte, you are not
connected at her wrist.

158
00:14:56,911 --> 00:15:00,121
Your father and I have counseling tonight.
I don't want you leaving the house.

159
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:03,541
The news says there's still
some wild animal on the loose.

160
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,543
They never go out.

161
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:08,380
Well, you're a big help.

162
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:10,415
As usual.

163
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:15,837
- Ginger.
- What?

164
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:19,925
- We'll get caught.
- No, we won't.

165
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:24,521
- The dog won't even be out.
- He has to pee some time.

166
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,940
People don't leave their
dogs out alone anymore.

167
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,400
Then you will just
have to distract her

168
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:31,695
while I nab the pooch
and make with the gore.

169
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,872
I can't distract her.

170
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:40,270
The fuck, B. This is your idea. If you
don't like your ideas, stop having them.

171
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:47,043
Sorry.

172
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:50,914
I've just just had it with
eating all this shit, OK?

173
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,420
Check it out.

174
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:02,434
Now we can even leave
a body. She'll freak.

175
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,177
Oh, wicked.

176
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,689
Take his...

177
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,975
leg?

178
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:20,277
He's still warm.

179
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,128
Oh, gross.

180
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,588
Shit!

181
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,208
Leave it then. The drag.

182
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,296
You got some on you.

183
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:41,465
Nice.

184
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,054
What?

185
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:51,099
B,

186
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:54,402
I just got the curse.

187
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,904
Eww.

188
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,948
Well, it's not contagious!

189
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,242
I know that.

190
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,652
God!

191
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:06,831
I mean, kill yourself to be different
and your own body screws you.

192
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:09,417
But if I start simping
around tampon dispensers

193
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:13,580
and moaning about
PMS, shoot me, OK?

194
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:31,514
Let's get out of here.

195
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:45,278
Ginger?

196
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,406
Ginger!

197
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:54,663
Ginger?

198
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,791
Ginger!

199
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:03,421
Ginger!

200
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:30,949
Oh God. He's right behind me.

201
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:42,085
Oh, my God!

202
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:52,846
Ginger!

203
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,974
Ginger!

204
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:05,358
Ginger!

205
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:34,137
Get up. Come on, get up!

206
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:05,627
Oh, fuck me.

207
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:18,556
Shit!

208
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,441
Mom!

209
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,737
Dad! Help!

210
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,122
Let me see.

211
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:40,002
- No, it hurts, it burns...
- I have to see it, Ginger.

212
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:44,507
- What was it? What was it?
- I don't know. A big dog, maybe.

213
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:47,635
That's not...
What did I do? What...

214
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:48,761
Shh.

215
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:51,222
I saw this thing once, on bears.

216
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:56,394
Said a bear will like, come after a
girl on the rag, because of the smell.

217
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:58,187
It wasn't a fucking bear!

218
00:20:58,188 --> 00:21:02,141
There wasn't any fucking
bears anywhere near here.

219
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:07,981
- Does that hurt?
- No.

220
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:15,079
That's impossible.
They're already healing.

221
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,164
No, this isn't right.
I'm calling 911.

222
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,374
No! No!

223
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,502
B, I'm not bleeding anymore. Right?

224
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,671
I mean... just...

225
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:25,798
spare me Pam finding out.

226
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,294
OK? I'm OK. OK?

227
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:34,882
- OK.
- I'm OK.

228
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,722
- I thought you were gonna die.
- I'm OK.

229
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:24,148
Preying upon normal healthy cells,

230
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:29,236
the intruder gradually devours
the host from within.

231
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:33,824
Eventually the invader
consumes its host completely,

232
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:38,070
and finally destroys it.

233
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:44,502
Complete meiosis involves two
successive division sequences,

234
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:50,583
which result in four new cells,
each of which is haploid.

235
00:23:02,896 --> 00:23:06,224
This one comes with
a free calendar.

236
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:13,439
Are you sure it's just cramps?

237
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,367
Just so you know...

238
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:21,447
the words 'just' and 'cramps',
they don't go together.

239
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,424
OK, you're really girling out here.

240
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:35,719
One day, you too will know my pain.

241
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,432
Hey, diss me or whatever,
but I got three sisters...

242
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:44,387
and nothing quite takes the
edge off like a good toke.

243
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:50,351
Well, maybe I like my edge, thanks.

244
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,814
Or maybe you're just
chickened to lose it.

245
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:12,540
Just pass it, fag.

246
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:21,090
- That a girl.
- Yeah.

247
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,811
An eighth's fifty.

248
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:39,442
- I don't want any drugs.
- Then amscray.

249
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:46,949
I was just wondering what you hit.

250
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:54,498
Well, officer, it looked like
a lycanthrope to me, sir.

251
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:58,836
- I know what a lycanthrope is.
- Sure you do.

252
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:03,841
Think you see werewolves a lot?

253
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:10,681
Why, do you?

254
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:17,063
Is it working?

255
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:21,776
No... but now I just don't care.

256
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,619
- What the hell are you guys doing in here?
- Sam, the Man.

257
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:34,171
Sam, man, we just needed
a place to come and smoke.

258
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:36,507
Hey, you know, I have an idea.

259
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:41,053
Why don't you guys get the
fuck out of my van, assholes!

260
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:44,715
No, I'm serious. Get out!
Get out. Get out!

261
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:51,480
- Samuel, what happened to your truck?
- I tapped a tree, all right. Good bye.

262
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:52,689
Ginge, let's go.

263
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,025
Yeah, why don't you stick to
your own species Fitzenstein?

264
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:57,645
Trina, stick my fist.

265
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:14,119
Oh you bitch! It's OK, baby.

266
00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:24,547
Ginge, what's going on?

267
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,933
Something's wrong.

268
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,177
Like more than you being just...

269
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:32,179
female.

270
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:36,016
Can you just say something, please?

271
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:48,704
Wow!

272
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:52,708
'Wow'? That's it? 'Wow'?

273
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:56,787
I can't have a hairy
chest, B. That's fucked!

274
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,582
No way.

275
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:05,337
The fuck? What the fuck?

276
00:27:05,346 --> 00:27:07,306
- This isn't...
- What?

277
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:09,967
- No way, like...
- What?

278
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:15,764
Bitten on a full moon.
Now you're hairy?

279
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:21,562
I know, but think about it.

280
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:26,900
Well thank you for taking my total
fucking nightmare so seriously!

281
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:38,704
Oh shit!

282
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:42,750
What if I'm dying or something?

283
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:49,465
We gotta see the nurse.

284
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:54,227
I'm sure it seems like a lot
of blood. It's a period.

285
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:58,357
But really it was like a...

286
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:00,067
geyser.

287
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,944
Everyone seems to panic
their first time.

288
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:05,906
Neither of you have had a period
before and you're how old?

289
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:09,743
I'm almost 16, she just turned 15.
She skipped a grade.

290
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:15,332
A thick, syrupy, voluminous
discharge is not uncommon.

291
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:19,961
The bulk of the uterine lining is
shed within the first few days.

292
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:24,508
Contractions, cramps,
squeeze it out like a pump.

293
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,095
In three to five days you'll find
lighter, bright-red bleeding.

294
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:34,676
That may turn to a brownish or blackish
sludge, which signals the end of the flow.

295
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,147
- OK, so it's all normal?
- Very!

296
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:45,479
Expect it every twenty eight days,
give or take, for the next thirty years.

297
00:28:45,863 --> 00:28:48,573
Great. Thanks.

298
00:28:48,574 --> 00:28:53,453
What about hair that wasn't
there before, and pain?

299
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:56,782
Mhm, comes with the territory.

300
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:00,544
Thank you. Let's go, B.

301
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:06,299
Wait, you'll have to protect against
both pregnancy and STDs now...

302
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,043
Play safe!

303
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:45,372
Wish this where babies' legs.

304
00:29:45,423 --> 00:29:48,967
Ginger's very favorite.

305
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:53,763
Congratulations sweetie. You
know you can ask me anything.

306
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:56,016
You're so dead.

307
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:57,309
I didn't.

308
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,804
Our little girl's a
young woman now.

309
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:10,155
- I'd never tell her anything.
- Unless you wanted to piss me off!

310
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:16,536
- I want you to be OK.
- I am! I just got my period, OK?

311
00:30:16,537 --> 00:30:21,374
Now, I've got weird hairs, so what?
That means I've got hormones,

312
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,544
and they may make me butt-ugly,
but they do not make me a monster.

313
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:26,463
So you got bit by a
great big hormone.

314
00:30:26,464 --> 00:30:28,840
Well not by what you
think. They don't exist!

315
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:31,301
Norman, shut the fuck up!

316
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:32,802
Maybe he's barking at you.

317
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:34,888
Did I change last night?

318
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,891
Howl at the moon, kill shit
and change back this morning?

319
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:38,892
Huh? No!

320
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:41,227
Did it take a silver bullet
to stop that thing? No!

321
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:43,688
It got killed by a fucking truck.

322
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:46,191
You always blow off
anything you don't get.

323
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:48,735
Yeah, when it's bullshit!

324
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:54,608
You're doing drugs with guys. Something
is definitely wrong with you.

325
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,286
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I do see a monster.

326
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:01,581
Yeah, it's got these
little green eyes.

327
00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:04,125
Oh yeah, like I really wish I
was hemorrhaging and hairy,

328
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,543
and sucking off Jason McCardy.

329
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:09,631
- Well you always wanted to be me!
- Well this isn't you, so.

330
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:10,799
Oh, poor B.

331
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,511
I'm growing up and
obviously you're not, huh?

332
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:18,173
- Well don't let me hold you back or anything.
- Oh, well, don't worry, I won't.

333
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,630
Only one creature on earth
destroys for pure pleasure.

334
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:52,582
It's a werewolf.

335
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:58,096
Oh my god, there it is.

336
00:31:58,097 --> 00:31:59,923
It's hideous!

337
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:22,821
Get the fuck outta the bathroom!
I'm trying to get ready!

338
00:32:29,837 --> 00:32:31,997
Ginger? Oh my god.

339
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:49,222
Oh babe...

340
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:51,099
Check it out.

341
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,935
Hello, hello, hello...

342
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,778
Hey!

343
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:49,165
Kid, you got a smoke?

344
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,617
No.

345
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:55,121
You got a light then?

346
00:33:57,925 --> 00:33:58,675
Oh, thank you.

347
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:03,129
I just spent a week of my life
looking for you. Give me a sec.

348
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:12,722
You dropped this - in my truck.

349
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:18,061
OK, we both saw it.
What the fuck was it?

350
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:21,698
- It's what you hit.
- Hmm! I know,

351
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,818
but what the fuck was it?

352
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:29,747
See, I flattened an animal. Furry,
all-fours, could be anything.

353
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:33,993
But here I am,
thinking 'lycanthrope'.

354
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:37,038
That's crazy, huh?

355
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:41,918
Book me into the rubber motel,
I'm officially all fucked up, right?

356
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:44,546
What if you're not?

357
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:50,685
Well, that would explain the
human circumcised dick,

358
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:54,222
and why you were running
for your life from it.

359
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:58,601
I have to go. Thanks for my stuff.

360
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:03,606
What's your name?

361
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:58,878
- Bullshit.
- Thanks.

362
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:01,164
No, hey, bullshit?

363
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:05,509
What do you say?

364
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,588
Swear you won't call a freak show.

365
00:36:10,098 --> 00:36:12,133
Yeah, I swear.

366
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:19,307
I'm changing, like right now and full
moons have nothing to do with it.

367
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:21,651
You're serious?

368
00:36:21,652 --> 00:36:23,778
And everything I look
at goes silver bullet,

369
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:28,524
in a gun, to my head, the end.

370
00:36:29,785 --> 00:36:31,194
Wow.

371
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:35,907
Let's not panic here. I mean...

372
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:42,088
for one, that thing on the road,
my van did a pretty good job on it,

373
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:48,086
without the benefit of silver bullets.
So, let's just forget the Hollywood rules.

374
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,137
There's got to be a cure, right?

375
00:36:50,138 --> 00:36:53,925
Otherwise, there would be a
hell of a lot more of them.

376
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:59,855
It's like an infection, it works from
the inside out. It's like a virus.

377
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:05,528
Biology, there's something you
can sink your teeth into.

378
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:07,855
So to speak.

379
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:12,910
You're real, your problem's
real, the solution's real.

380
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:17,782
Not bam, death by morality call.

381
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,876
Then again when I started
piercing shit, I got infections,

382
00:37:20,877 --> 00:37:24,288
girl says try pure silver,
cleared up like that.

383
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:33,723
The ancients thought pure
metals purified their blood.

384
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:38,761
- They thought leeches did, too.
- They do.

385
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:46,610
Hey, why don't you get your
slut-bitch sister a leash?

386
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:47,987
What a freak.

387
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:50,273
Nice bird necklace.

388
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:55,236
Ginger, a word?

389
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,159
- Is it sorry?
- No.

390
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:06,005
Come on Jason, let's go.

391
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:07,748
Oh yes.

392
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:10,168
Ginger!

393
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:11,869
Ginger!

394
00:38:14,473 --> 00:38:17,967
Hey. She's ovulating!

395
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:32,773
See you, freak. Bye bye.

396
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:40,289
This is a very exciting,
confusing time for your sister.

397
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,710
Boys, her body, trying to fit in.

398
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,046
Maybe if she felt that she
could share more with you,

399
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:49,874
you'd both be a lot happier.

400
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:56,964
You know, Brigitte, your
turn's coming, too... one day

401
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:10,853
My stomach.

402
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:16,317
Hey, take it easy, all right?
We've got all night.

403
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:20,980
Sorry, you just taste really good.

404
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:25,329
Just lie back and relax.

405
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:28,754
You lie back and relax!

406
00:39:28,755 --> 00:39:31,415
Who's the guy here?

407
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:36,303
Who's the guy here? Huh?
Who's the fucking guy here?

408
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:38,798
Don't we need protection here?

409
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:40,967
Stop it!

410
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:43,435
Wait a second!

411
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:46,847
You're fucking hilarious, cave boy.

412
00:40:07,627 --> 00:40:09,453
Ginge?

413
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:12,498
What happened?

414
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,253
Did he hurt you?

415
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,850
If he hurt you, you should tell.

416
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,558
Oh, my god!

417
00:40:33,486 --> 00:40:36,530
- Get out! Get out!
- What happened?

418
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:40,818
Something is really,
really wrong with me, B.

419
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:45,956
What happened?

420
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:49,418
I get this ache and...

421
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:56,709
I thought it was for sex, but it's to
tear everything into fucking pieces.

422
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:02,548
Where is he?

423
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:09,930
Next door.

424
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:26,488
Oh, my god!

425
00:41:27,457 --> 00:41:29,909
You killed Norman.

426
00:41:30,752 --> 00:41:37,208
He barked and he barked and he
kept fucking barking, and...

427
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:42,630
I just... I just...

428
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:45,591
I couldn't stop myself.

429
00:41:46,768 --> 00:41:51,138
B, what am I supposed to do?

430
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:58,395
It wasn't at all like I
thought it would be.

431
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:06,528
There was just all this
squirming and squealing.

432
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:12,368
And than he's done,
and you're like 'Oh?'

433
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:19,083
Just probably out there telling
everyone what a freak I am.

434
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:24,137
We'll say the same thing about him.

435
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:30,469
It doesn't work like that.
I mean, he got laid.

436
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,437
I'm just a lay.

437
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:37,101
He's a hero and I’m just a
lay, a freaked mutant lay.

438
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:40,521
Did you use something?

439
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,523
No.

440
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:53,500
You really think this will work?

441
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:56,412
We have to try something.

442
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:02,301
Where did you get that, that ring?

443
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:04,128
I found it.

444
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:07,464
Too bad.

445
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:14,972
You should have one too. I mean,
for being with me on this.

446
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:21,228
Ready?

447
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:24,565
Yeah.

448
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:39,121
Shit, it's stuck!

449
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:43,876
Hold still.

450
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,255
- Fuck! Hurry up!
- Sorry, sorry.

451
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:51,049
It's almost there.

452
00:43:57,273 --> 00:43:59,516
How do you feel?

453
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:06,231
Wicked.

454
00:44:13,122 --> 00:44:14,990
Norman?

455
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:19,286
Hey, Norman.

456
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:39,940
Hurry up!

457
00:44:39,941 --> 00:44:44,645
- Hold still.
- I am, hurry up.

458
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:06,917
Come on, hit it, baby.

459
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:20,931
- Oh, McCardy what happened to you?
- Ginger Fitzgerald rocked my world.

460
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:25,060
What, did you get your rag, too?

461
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:27,479
Oh, shit!

462
00:45:27,947 --> 00:45:30,524
It must be ink, all right? Fuck!

463
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,576
Hi!

464
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,496
Brigitte!

465
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:49,001
Brigitte, come here.

466
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:52,178
What the fuck, B? Did you get
a boyfriend or something?

467
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,973
No, we just...

468
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:57,467
I'll be right back.

469
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:04,691
Oh my god.

470
00:46:04,692 --> 00:46:08,611
Hey, what's up? Look, if silver's shot,
I've been reading and I got another idea.

471
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:13,900
Are you on drugs, like right now?
I'm in class here.

472
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:19,531
Yeah, excuse me for giving a shit.

473
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:24,745
- I'll come see you later, OK?
- Whatever.

474
00:46:30,676 --> 00:46:34,129
The Fitzen sister are
really getting around.

475
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:40,852
- OK, line change. Let's go.
- He thinks I got bit.

476
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:44,522
I trust you, and you blabbed to the
first fuck-up who comes along.

477
00:46:44,523 --> 00:46:47,150
He knows stuff, he wants to help.

478
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:51,188
He wants to get down
your pants, stupid!

479
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:56,443
So, sluts run in the family...
quel shocker!

480
00:47:17,098 --> 00:47:20,008
- Knock it off!
- Ginger, no!

481
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:22,644
Ginger, no! Stop!

482
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:25,430
Fight, fight, fight...

483
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:33,563
- You started it.
- Ginger, to the office.

484
00:47:40,162 --> 00:47:43,081
This school has a 'zero
tolerance for violence'-policy.

485
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:44,541
I mean a temper like
that is inexcusable

486
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:48,370
barring substantial
extenuating circumstances.

487
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:22,921
What are you looking at? Huh?
My pen exploded, OK. My red pen.

488
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:24,767
That was fucking incredible.

489
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:28,585
Get your camera, don't you have a
camera? This is wall-worthy. Come on.

490
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:35,000
You gave it to Jason. You had
unprotected sex, and you infected him.

491
00:48:36,051 --> 00:48:37,460
Oops!

492
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:45,885
- I have to see Sam. He's got an idea.
- I bet he does. Well, let's go.

493
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,813
If you come, you can't
be weird, Ginger.

494
00:48:48,814 --> 00:48:51,941
If he gets I lied. If he gets that
you're really the one who's really...

495
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:55,320
a what? ...A monster? Huh, a freak?

496
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:59,899
If he thinks I dicked him
around, he'll blow this off.

497
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:03,653
I'll behave.

498
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:11,786
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore
art thou Romeo?

499
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:16,466
- Hey.
- Hey.

500
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:20,553
Sorry about before. I was just afraid
someone would hear us, that's all.

501
00:49:20,554 --> 00:49:24,015
Yeah, she is just a
little moody lately.

502
00:49:24,016 --> 00:49:27,769
That whole silver thing didn't
quite work out, did it?

503
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,022
I wasn't expecting company.

504
00:49:31,023 --> 00:49:34,809
My sister, Ginger. She knows.

505
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:40,356
If you two come in here, you see
sweet fuck all. Understood?

506
00:49:46,955 --> 00:49:48,698
Jesus!

507
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:52,710
Wicked! Smoke us up!

508
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:55,997
Yeah, wicked huh? Get the fuck out!

509
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:00,635
All right, Brigitte,
it brakes down like this.

510
00:50:00,636 --> 00:50:02,220
I compared

511
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:06,474
homeopathic treatments of infections
to the folklore of all this. Take a look.

512
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:09,310
Aconitum di lycotonum.

513
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:12,021
- 'Lyco' as in wolf?
- Right.

514
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,189
It's called Monkshood.

515
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:16,818
It's a cousin of wolfsbane, except
this stuff is safe in small doses.

516
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:20,404
It's a super oxidant
breed, radical detox.

517
00:50:20,405 --> 00:50:22,907
It promotes white
blood cell growth.

518
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:25,993
Which fight infection.
Do you have some?

519
00:50:25,994 --> 00:50:27,298
Well, it's perennial.

520
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:29,664
It grows everywhere,
but only in the spring.

521
00:50:29,665 --> 00:50:33,326
Fuck! This is bullshit, OK?

522
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:39,090
- I seeded some, I'm growing it.
- She doesn't have time for that.

523
00:50:39,091 --> 00:50:41,664
She's killed a dog already.

524
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,720
She's fucked. She's growing
a tail. Did you tell him that?

525
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:46,548
Ginger!

526
00:50:47,182 --> 00:50:50,009
You're growing a tail?

527
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:51,678
Yes.

528
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:57,567
Look, he's just another
wank job. OK?

529
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:00,444
What the fuck do you think
you are? Give me that.

530
00:51:00,445 --> 00:51:03,072
What the fuck are you?
Pervert, she's 15!

531
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:05,358
Ginger, wait outside!

532
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:17,103
Fine, if he rapes you, don't
come crying. I'll be at home.

533
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:24,419
She's just freaking.

534
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,290
I do not think of you that way.

535
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:48,874
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

536
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:05,760
Your dad's battery is dead again.
He's stranded at the supermarket.

537
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:08,429
- Wanna go for a ride?
- Jesus, can't you knock?

538
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,007
Don't you 'Jesus' me.

539
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:13,267
You don't have anything
I haven't seen before.

540
00:52:13,268 --> 00:52:14,435
That's what you think.

541
00:52:14,436 --> 00:52:16,062
What is that supposed to mean?

542
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:20,308
Nothing, I'm just, I'm fat,
all right. Get out!

543
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,485
Ginger, you are not fat.

544
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:25,780
These fashion models are all
on speed to look like that.

545
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:28,149
Get out!

546
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:32,036
OK. Gosh.

547
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:34,280
I'll be back soon.

548
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:55,384
Give me back my dog.

549
00:52:55,394 --> 00:53:00,473
- Trina, I don't have your dog.
- Ginger took him. I saw her.

550
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:06,604
You know, I feel sorry for you.
He doesn't like you.

551
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:11,651
He's a cherry-hound.
He's into virgins.

552
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:14,411
Trina, you're bleeding. Go home.

553
00:53:14,412 --> 00:53:18,582
If you are so fucking smart, you
won't give him the satisfaction.

554
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:22,253
Somebody just once shouldn't give
that fucker the satisfaction!

555
00:53:22,254 --> 00:53:25,506
- Trina, go now.
- You are as big a cunt as your sister.

556
00:53:25,507 --> 00:53:27,508
I am not.

557
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:31,178
- Hey, meat. Back for more?
- What are you doing?

558
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:35,724
I don't know, B. What am I doing?
Call Sam. Ask the pro.

559
00:53:35,725 --> 00:53:37,468
What?

560
00:53:37,477 --> 00:53:41,605
You play with your new friends,
and I'll play with mine.

561
00:53:41,606 --> 00:53:44,817
Ginger, what the
hell are you doing?

562
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:48,863
You smell yummy. What is that?
Citrus or antiseptic? I'm not sure.

563
00:53:48,864 --> 00:53:51,107
Are you crazy?

564
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:56,912
- OK, that's enough. Just let her go.
- Shut up. Shut up, shut up.

565
00:53:56,913 --> 00:54:00,124
OK, let's just chill. Right, Trina?

566
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:00,833
You know what, Trina?

567
00:54:00,834 --> 00:54:03,460
She's doing your boy, now. I wouldn't
be so quick to get so friendly.

568
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:06,630
- Stop it, it's not like that.
- I think she's scared for you, love, huh?

569
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:08,424
She's an asshole.
She's not worth it.

570
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:10,384
You asked for this!

571
00:54:10,385 --> 00:54:15,014
You picked Sam over me. Whatever
happens now, it is your fault!

572
00:54:15,015 --> 00:54:20,561
- This is not you. Just let's cope.
- Oh, with what? With this kind of shit.

573
00:54:20,562 --> 00:54:23,188
He's wrong, moron.
You can't fix this!

574
00:54:23,189 --> 00:54:25,274
You don't know that.
Just give me a chance.

575
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,651
What, another one?
God gee, I don't know, B...

576
00:54:27,652 --> 00:54:29,320
see I'm going way way out there...

577
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:33,983
way way far from where you live,
which you pretty much fucking rule.

578
00:54:34,826 --> 00:54:41,040
Oh god, that's disgusting,
you fucking gross, fucking...

579
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:42,041
Back!

580
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:46,587
Don't touch me, you freaks.
You're both just totally fucked.

581
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:48,998
Trina, we were just...

582
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:55,254
Uh-oh.

583
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:15,900
Get up!

584
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:21,906
Get up now!

585
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:25,910
Henry, what on earth are
you doing out there?

586
00:55:26,628 --> 00:55:31,332
Come on, don't eat it
until we get inside.

587
00:55:36,054 --> 00:55:39,882
Jesus Christ on a
bicycle! What the...?

588
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,853
Girls, I told you, no
more deaths in the house!

589
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:47,648
Don't be mad,
it's for extra credit.

590
00:55:47,649 --> 00:55:50,935
Back to immaculate in ten minutes.

591
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:56,565
Corn syrup. Dad, d'you want some?

592
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:03,030
Well I better get this meat away.

593
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:05,741
I'll do that.

594
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:16,418
- Mom.
- What?

595
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:23,259
What do guys want?

596
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:31,809
Brigitte, I'm so glad you asked.

597
00:56:35,405 --> 00:56:38,691
And that's what men want.

598
00:56:39,951 --> 00:56:44,580
Some of them might seem cool or different,
but they're all pretty much the same.

599
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,749
- Totally.
- Thanks for sharing.

600
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,995
Oh, honey, that's
what we're here for.

601
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:57,668
Bed time. It's a school
night. Beauty rest.

602
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:15,144
This is just great.

603
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:19,982
Yeah, field hockey will suck now.

604
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:24,987
Get me a screwdriver.

605
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:43,422
Oh, god!

606
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:51,972
Way to go.

607
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:18,173
Here it is: 'Why your
daughter dates dummies?'

608
00:58:18,174 --> 00:58:21,627
I'm so glad I hung on to this.

609
00:58:21,803 --> 00:58:27,424
- I think they're up to something.
- They're just being normal teenage girls.

610
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:31,929
Then why are they suddenly so
interested in what you have to say?

611
00:58:33,523 --> 00:58:38,811
Stay in your own little world, Henry.
This one just confuses you.

612
00:58:45,076 --> 00:58:48,328
Shit. Look at all the worms.

613
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:52,533
Remember when I used to make you
eat them just to get in here?

614
00:58:52,917 --> 00:58:57,996
Shallow grave? Oh well,
seems appropriate.

615
00:58:59,757 --> 00:59:02,584
You dig for a while.

616
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:06,179
Look,

617
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,807
no one ever thinks chicks
do shit like this.

618
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:13,353
Trust me, a girl can
only be a slut,

619
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:18,058
a bitch, a tease, or
the virgin next door.

620
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:22,396
We'll just coast on
how the world works.

621
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:29,278
Think she's pretty?

622
00:59:30,788 --> 00:59:34,074
If I wasn't here,
would you eat her?

623
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:36,368
No.

624
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:43,458
- God, that'd be like, fucking her.
- You can't go out anymore.

625
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,923
Well I can't stay in,
I'll go mental.

626
00:59:55,688 --> 00:59:59,274
We'll make Pam think
you're at school.

627
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:02,652
We'll make school think
you're home sick.

628
01:00:02,653 --> 01:00:06,281
Just till there is no
doubt about us in this.

629
01:00:06,282 --> 01:00:11,820
Then we blow, as far away
from here as possible.

630
01:00:25,301 --> 01:00:27,886
Your attention, please.

631
01:00:27,887 --> 01:00:30,889
Starting immediately certain
students will be paged to the office

632
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:35,268
to assist the police regarding
Trina Sinclair's disappearance.

633
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:36,770
She is dead, man.

634
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:40,599
When your name is called,
please come to the office.

635
01:00:58,084 --> 01:01:01,036
Is Ginger avoiding me?

636
01:01:03,422 --> 01:01:06,424
'Cause I'm feeling
pretty good right now.

637
01:01:06,425 --> 01:01:09,386
I just got a few questions
for her, like uh...

638
01:01:09,387 --> 01:01:12,013
I'm growing a goddamn
tail outta my ass,

639
01:01:12,014 --> 01:01:16,685
and I thought she might have a few tips
on how to deal with keeping that quiet!

640
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:18,728
Hurting me won't help.

641
01:01:18,754 --> 01:01:22,148
See? I'm up to some
whack shit right now.

642
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:26,361
I'm way out on the corner
of 'Fucked-Up and Evil'.

643
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:30,941
You wanna know what I did
for fun last night, huh?

644
01:01:31,242 --> 01:01:35,996
I killed my own freaking dog, OK?
What am I supposed to do about that?

645
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:40,667
- You're gonna be in deep shit.
- I'm right with you on deep shit,

646
01:01:40,668 --> 01:01:43,370
and I think you know why.

647
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:47,541
What's going on here?

648
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:51,711
Thanks.

649
01:02:02,314 --> 01:02:06,484
- Ginger, how was school today?
- I don't know, I didn't go.

650
01:02:06,485 --> 01:02:08,570
- We had a field trip.
- Really?

651
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:11,773
I didn't sign any form
for a field trip.

652
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:14,242
Daddy, will you teach me
how to drive tonight?

653
01:02:14,243 --> 01:02:17,028
Next year. Maybe.

654
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,122
So where did you go?

655
01:02:19,123 --> 01:02:22,041
- What if next year never comes?
- Ginger.

656
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,293
Mr. Wayne called today.

657
01:02:23,294 --> 01:02:26,421
He wanted to know if you
were feeling any better.

658
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:29,090
When you might be
coming back to school.

659
01:02:29,091 --> 01:02:33,178
The police wanna talk to you. Something
about a fight with a missing girl?

660
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:36,756
- Daddy, may I be excused?
- No, you may not.

661
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:40,760
- Ginger, wait.
- For what, B?

662
01:02:41,145 --> 01:02:43,263
Oh no, you don't.

663
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:51,563
I want to know what's
going on. Right now.

664
01:02:57,828 --> 01:03:00,246
- What are these?
- Monkshood. Brigitte...

665
01:03:00,247 --> 01:03:01,728
Where did you get them?

666
01:03:01,754 --> 01:03:05,269
From a craft store.
Now, I want an answer.

667
01:03:08,547 --> 01:03:11,308
Trina Sinclair tried to beat me up,

668
01:03:11,334 --> 01:03:17,448
'cause Jason McCardy liked us better,
so Ginger beat her up. That's all.

669
01:03:17,474 --> 01:03:18,848
That's all?

670
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:22,969
Beating up other girls?
Cutting classes?

671
01:03:23,354 --> 01:03:26,773
- I'm very disappointed, Brigitte.
- Sorry.

672
01:03:26,774 --> 01:03:31,194
You just do whatever she
wants you to. You always have.

673
01:03:31,195 --> 01:03:34,940
I really wish you'd start
thinking more for yourself.

674
01:03:37,618 --> 01:03:41,246
Do you think I should talk to her?

675
01:03:41,247 --> 01:03:43,657
Check in?

676
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:48,253
She thinks it's cool you let us
figure stuff out for ourselves.

677
01:03:48,254 --> 01:03:49,788
Oh?

678
01:03:51,006 --> 01:03:52,749
Really?

679
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:58,137
I wondered if that
approach was working.

680
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:00,507
Look what Pamela had.

681
01:04:03,185 --> 01:04:07,939
- What are you doing? Stop!
- I'll just take it off.

682
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,557
No!

683
01:04:09,608 --> 01:04:11,651
I killed their pets, B.

684
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:15,989
And nothing helps except
tearing live things to pieces.

685
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,358
I can't be like this.

686
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:19,951
This is monkshood.

687
01:04:19,952 --> 01:04:24,614
First thing tomorrow we find out
how to use it and we take off.

688
01:04:25,874 --> 01:04:31,037
If you give up now, you leave me here
alone. I would never do that to you!

689
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:36,459
I'm sorry. I'm scared.

690
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:04,404
BCX radio wishes you
a happy Halloween...

691
01:05:31,815 --> 01:05:36,319
B, what the fuck are you doing?

692
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,697
Hey... B, let me out!

693
01:05:39,698 --> 01:05:41,407
I have to deal with the cure.

694
01:05:41,408 --> 01:05:44,076
This way, you can't hurt
yourself or anybody else.

695
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:50,875
Fuck. You fucking sissy little girl.
You're going rat me out?

696
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:53,127
Just shut up and wait for me.

697
01:05:53,128 --> 01:05:57,290
You little bitch! Fuck you!
I hate you!

698
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:02,595
B, let me out. Come on.

699
01:06:02,596 --> 01:06:04,130
B?

700
01:06:05,015 --> 01:06:06,432
B!

701
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,718
Let me out!

702
01:06:22,366 --> 01:06:25,076
Holly shit, that's monkshood.
Where the fuck did you get that?

703
01:06:25,077 --> 01:06:30,240
I don't know if you smoke it or eat
it or what, but I need to try it now.

704
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,502
Well, you got me but...

705
01:06:34,503 --> 01:06:40,333
to be sure, I'd have to
say direct route. Inject it.

706
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:45,721
But see, that's a bad idea Brigitte, because
neither of us know what this stuff does.

707
01:06:45,722 --> 01:06:49,300
It can't be worse
than being road kill.

708
01:06:50,394 --> 01:06:53,187
The dosage will be
a guess. I mean...

709
01:06:53,188 --> 01:06:55,398
It would have to be, there
is no way to match for...

710
01:06:55,399 --> 01:06:59,018
metabolism, body weight,
there could be side effects.

711
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:05,775
- You can not try this alone.
- My sister will be there.

712
01:08:27,657 --> 01:08:32,111
Understand you may kill
her trying to save her.

713
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:34,197
What?

714
01:08:34,498 --> 01:08:37,325
It's for Ginger, isn't it?

715
01:08:39,836 --> 01:08:45,458
Look, worst-case scenario,
you put her out of her misery.

716
01:08:46,343 --> 01:08:50,880
Just as long as you're prepared
for that, and I mean sure.

717
01:08:53,517 --> 01:08:56,511
Try to come tonight.

718
01:09:19,751 --> 01:09:22,962
Hey, have you seen Jason?

719
01:09:22,963 --> 01:09:25,923
Umm... you got a little...

720
01:09:25,924 --> 01:09:27,716
You're going to the
greenhouse bash tonight?

721
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:30,052
- Erm, yeah.
- Good.

722
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:34,048
I'm in charge of the prizes.
You, too, could be winner.

723
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,390
Ginger. My office. Now.

724
01:09:46,903 --> 01:09:48,980
Help! Help!

725
01:09:57,038 --> 01:09:58,664
Help! Help!

726
01:09:58,665 --> 01:10:00,124
Let me go.

727
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:01,867
Let me go!

728
01:10:02,168 --> 01:10:05,329
Let him go, McCardy.

729
01:10:07,841 --> 01:10:12,545
Oh yeah, a chick. Excellent.

730
01:10:12,846 --> 01:10:15,389
Come to papa, baby.

731
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:18,050
Come and get some candy.

732
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,754
I have to go. Um...

733
01:10:55,722 --> 01:10:58,507
I have a class.

734
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:05,939
Attention please.

735
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,358
Brigitte Fitzgerald,
please report to guidance.

736
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:10,811
Brigitte Fitzerald to guidance.

737
01:11:33,802 --> 01:11:39,598
He wanted to call fucking Pamela,
B, and tell her we needed help.

738
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:41,391
So, I stopped him.

739
01:11:41,392 --> 01:11:46,680
You see how that works?
How I do not betray you?

740
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:50,643
I didn't betray you.

741
01:11:53,238 --> 01:11:58,150
You locked me up.

742
01:12:01,037 --> 01:12:04,406
You need to get this fixed.

743
01:12:04,874 --> 01:12:11,622
Why? So I can go to jail,
for the rest of my life?

744
01:12:14,384 --> 01:12:17,678
We wait till everyone leaves,

745
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,550
then we clean this up, somehow.

746
01:12:22,934 --> 01:12:26,512
I think you've fucked up enough.

747
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:39,984
Oh my god!

748
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:43,737
- Henry?
- Oh g...

749
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:47,032
What is it?

750
01:12:49,836 --> 01:12:55,708
Henry, for Pete's sake. It's
only the girls' death project.

751
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:59,670
They're fake, you big baby.

752
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:42,512
I'm gonna find something
to clean this up.

753
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:46,675
Stay here and lock the door.

754
01:15:04,478 --> 01:15:06,455
Oh my god!

755
01:15:23,573 --> 01:15:25,657
Hello, Brigitte.

756
01:15:25,658 --> 01:15:28,118
- Stop it!
- Can I touch your boobies?

757
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,120
I like little girls.

758
01:15:30,121 --> 01:15:31,621
Leave him alone!

759
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:32,998
Ginger. Stop! Stop!

760
01:15:32,999 --> 01:15:34,875
Ginger, fucking stop!

761
01:15:34,876 --> 01:15:36,618
Please stop!

762
01:15:37,628 --> 01:15:42,007
Ginger, stop!
He hasn't done anything!

763
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:45,377
I don't like how he looks at you.

764
01:15:56,981 --> 01:15:58,807
Oh my god!

765
01:16:11,954 --> 01:16:14,823
He found me. Brigitte.

766
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:19,244
- The mess. I had to...
- Go to hell!

767
01:16:28,012 --> 01:16:32,799
He's not dead. You've infected him.

768
01:16:33,643 --> 01:16:36,345
Let me call help for him.

769
01:16:40,358 --> 01:16:42,100
Oh fuck!

770
01:16:43,069 --> 01:16:44,603
Fuck!

771
01:16:49,659 --> 01:16:51,526
You like it.

772
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:56,990
It feels so... good, Brigitte.

773
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:01,169
It's like touching yourself.

774
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:05,632
You know every move...
right on the fucking dot.

775
01:17:05,633 --> 01:17:08,218
And after...

776
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:13,673
you see fucking
fireworks, supernovas.

777
01:17:14,809 --> 01:17:18,053
I'm a goddamn force of nature.

778
01:17:18,687 --> 01:17:24,726
I feel like I could do
just about anything.

779
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:33,952
You know we're almost not
even related anymore.

780
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:36,404
You're fucked!

781
01:17:37,998 --> 01:17:40,625
You'd love it. Should
come for the ride.

782
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:44,337
A little scratch. Swap some juice.

783
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:48,383
We'll be our own pack,
like before. It's so us, B.

784
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:52,295
I'd rather be dead
than be what you are.

785
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,347
We have a pact!

786
01:17:54,348 --> 01:17:59,636
Out by sixteen or dead in this scene,
but together for fucking ever!

787
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,480
I said I would die for you!

788
01:18:02,481 --> 01:18:08,728
No. You said you'd die with me.
'Cause you had nothing better to do.

789
01:18:11,157 --> 01:18:13,275
Fuck you too.

790
01:18:13,659 --> 01:18:18,488
You think I wanna go
back to being nobody?

791
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:21,199
You're fucked!

792
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:25,203
Stay the hell out of
my way, Brigitte.

793
01:18:25,754 --> 01:18:29,165
And I'll tell Sam you said hi.

794
01:19:12,176 --> 01:19:15,045
Stop! Stop!

795
01:19:29,652 --> 01:19:32,278
Where is your sister?

796
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:34,822
County greenhouse.

797
01:19:34,823 --> 01:19:36,900
Get in the van.

798
01:20:02,309 --> 01:20:06,554
All right, Fitz.
Wicked costume, baby.

799
01:20:23,372 --> 01:20:25,323
Where is Sam?

800
01:20:32,756 --> 01:20:34,374
Shit!

801
01:20:35,759 --> 01:20:37,502
Hey.

802
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:43,633
- Hey Ginger, where is Brigitte?
- She couldn't make it.

803
01:20:44,059 --> 01:20:47,178
- Yeah, why is that?
- Cramps.

804
01:20:48,147 --> 01:20:50,557
She says hi.

805
01:20:53,068 --> 01:20:55,153
You wanna buy or something?

806
01:20:55,154 --> 01:20:57,313
Or something.

807
01:21:09,334 --> 01:21:12,503
- Go get your sister.
- Mom, I don't think...

808
01:21:12,504 --> 01:21:15,540
You've done a terrible thing.

809
01:21:15,883 --> 01:21:17,625
But...

810
01:21:19,136 --> 01:21:22,380
you're my tiny babies.

811
01:21:23,223 --> 01:21:26,559
It's one thing if you
leave, it's almost normal,

812
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,554
but no one is gonna
take you from me.

813
01:21:30,564 --> 01:21:34,233
First thing tomorrow I'll let the house
fill up with gas, and light a match.

814
01:21:34,234 --> 01:21:35,735
What?

815
01:21:35,736 --> 01:21:41,065
We'll start fresh. Just
us girls. It'll be fun.

816
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:44,444
What about dad?

817
01:21:44,786 --> 01:21:49,574
He'll just blame me, they all will.

818
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:56,873
This isn't your fault, mom.

819
01:22:03,513 --> 01:22:05,465
Yes it is.

820
01:22:09,186 --> 01:22:11,679
Lock the doors, OK?

821
01:22:20,614 --> 01:22:24,817
- Ginger, come on.
- No, you come on.

822
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:30,865
- What are you doing?
- I know you want to. Everybody does.

823
01:22:31,917 --> 01:22:36,462
Really, what would I be like?

824
01:22:36,463 --> 01:22:38,956
What would I do?

825
01:22:39,341 --> 01:22:45,304
- What would I feel like inside?
- Ginger, stop.

826
01:22:45,305 --> 01:22:49,634
- Make me.
- Ginger, your sister...

827
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:15,701
This is fucked.

828
01:23:16,628 --> 01:23:19,964
Ginger, get off me. Get off me.

829
01:23:19,965 --> 01:23:21,833
Ginger, get off me!

830
01:23:24,261 --> 01:23:26,137
Jerk!

831
01:23:26,138 --> 01:23:30,299
What? I told you to stop. Oh Jesus.

832
01:23:31,476 --> 01:23:34,311
God, Ginger get up. I'm sorry.

833
01:23:34,312 --> 01:23:36,806
Get up, Ginger.

834
01:23:39,901 --> 01:23:41,110
You bitch!

835
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:42,778
You want me? You want me?

836
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:46,073
Stop hurting everybody
else and take me. Take me!

837
01:23:46,074 --> 01:23:50,361
I don't want you!
I don't even know you!

838
01:23:53,206 --> 01:23:55,449
Brigitte, don't.

839
01:24:01,506 --> 01:24:03,666
Brigitte, don't!

840
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:08,254
You wrecked everything for
me that isn't about you.

841
01:24:10,807 --> 01:24:12,425
No.

842
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:15,344
Shit.

843
01:24:17,147 --> 01:24:19,557
Now I am you.

844
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:26,022
I know you are. But what am I?

845
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:30,276
We got to go.

846
01:25:01,983 --> 01:25:05,811
B, I can't. I'm turning too fast.

847
01:25:11,076 --> 01:25:15,579
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I won't let you do this, Brigitte.

848
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,831
You both need help.

849
01:25:17,832 --> 01:25:20,701
You fucking idiot!

850
01:25:20,919 --> 01:25:22,086
The cure works.

851
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:24,588
I had to use it on somebody else,
but there is more at the house.

852
01:25:24,589 --> 01:25:27,341
This is the only way I could
get her to come back with me.

853
01:25:27,342 --> 01:25:29,627
Oh shit!

854
01:25:29,803 --> 01:25:32,963
What? How was I
supposed to know that?

855
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:39,895
Just help me, OK? Just get her
in your truck and drive us home.

856
01:25:39,896 --> 01:25:43,849
Fine, but she rides in the back.

857
01:25:56,246 --> 01:25:59,657
This is nuts, you need a doctor.

858
01:26:03,003 --> 01:26:04,453
Oh!

859
01:26:05,213 --> 01:26:06,831
Jesus.

860
01:26:09,008 --> 01:26:12,428
She could have killed
you, Brigitte.

861
01:26:12,429 --> 01:26:15,214
She needs me.

862
01:26:15,515 --> 01:26:20,344
Get home. Cure her, cure me.

863
01:26:20,562 --> 01:26:22,805
And then what?

864
01:26:23,231 --> 01:26:24,932
Run.

865
01:26:26,359 --> 01:26:29,645
You know you're kidding yourself.

866
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:20,779
I'll be right back.
Give me the syringe.

867
01:27:26,044 --> 01:27:28,662
Dad? Hello?

868
01:27:29,547 --> 01:27:31,165
Oh shit!

869
01:27:34,385 --> 01:27:37,463
Yeah, I've meant to fix that.

870
01:27:38,223 --> 01:27:42,885
- Did she get out?
- Oh god, I hope not.

871
01:27:43,269 --> 01:27:45,596
I can't see anything.

872
01:27:47,815 --> 01:27:50,267
Pass me that flashlight.

873
01:28:17,804 --> 01:28:19,254
Fuck!

874
01:28:21,307 --> 01:28:25,010
That was your god damn sister!

875
01:28:28,481 --> 01:28:30,307
Oh fuck.

876
01:28:32,777 --> 01:28:35,688
The monkshood's in there.

877
01:28:36,114 --> 01:28:39,358
Oh, you're out of your mind.

878
01:28:39,784 --> 01:28:41,902
Not yet.

879
01:28:42,286 --> 01:28:46,281
Be quiet. I gotta get this stuff.

880
01:28:53,089 --> 01:28:54,832
Great.

881
01:29:22,076 --> 01:29:24,820
Fuck! Where the fuck is she?

882
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:30,033
Shh.

883
01:29:50,313 --> 01:29:53,223
- Let's do this fast.
- Hell, yes.

884
01:29:56,694 --> 01:29:59,688
All right, bowls.

885
01:30:01,407 --> 01:30:03,901
Alcohol, alcohol.

886
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,534
Brigitte.

887
01:30:13,878 --> 01:30:15,954
Could I have your lighter?

888
01:30:16,172 --> 01:30:19,374
I can't feel my hand.

889
01:30:19,634 --> 01:30:21,460
Jesus Christ.

890
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:26,181
Oh fuck!

891
01:30:26,182 --> 01:30:28,467
Go! Go!

892
01:30:37,777 --> 01:30:39,653
- Alcohol.
- What?

893
01:30:39,654 --> 01:30:43,482
- Alcohol!
- Oh shit. Yeah.

894
01:30:46,536 --> 01:30:49,321
Start grinding up the buds.

895
01:30:57,046 --> 01:30:59,748
All right, pour it in.

896
01:31:00,675 --> 01:31:03,377
Easy, easy, easy...

897
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,005
What was that?

898
01:31:09,559 --> 01:31:12,886
Shit, keep going. Go, go.

899
01:31:13,646 --> 01:31:15,806
All right, hold this.

900
01:31:21,612 --> 01:31:27,275
- Right, that's real fucking hygienic.
- I doubt it matters.

901
01:31:31,622 --> 01:31:33,373
How about you take
this and we blow?

902
01:31:33,374 --> 01:31:36,243
How about no?

903
01:31:38,129 --> 01:31:40,171
Then let me do it,
you can hardly move.

904
01:31:40,172 --> 01:31:41,999
No!

905
01:31:42,508 --> 01:31:45,419
You can't do this by yourself.

906
01:31:45,803 --> 01:31:48,680
Let me take the needle,
I'll go into the living room,

907
01:31:48,681 --> 01:31:52,926
you lead her in, bam we're done.

908
01:31:57,231 --> 01:32:00,017
- OK.
- OK.

909
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,278
- I'm going.
- Be careful.

910
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:31,352
Sam?

911
01:36:06,939 --> 01:36:08,807
Ginger?

912
01:37:53,587 --> 01:37:55,455
I can't.

913
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:58,958
I won't.

914
01:38:00,427 --> 01:38:02,503
The fuck.

915
01:38:54,815 --> 01:38:56,557
Fuck off!

916
01:38:59,277 --> 01:39:01,270
Leave me alone!

917
01:40:37,626 --> 01:40:39,368
Ginger?

918
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,001
Come on. It's me.

919
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:50,629
OK?

920
01:40:52,432 --> 01:40:55,551
Ginger, please, it's me!

921
01:41:06,237 --> 01:41:08,522
You want this?

922
01:41:12,452 --> 01:41:14,945
You want this?

923
01:41:29,427 --> 01:41:33,297
I'm not dying in
this room with you!

924
01:41:37,018 --> 01:41:39,512
I'm not dying!
