1
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,896
Wat do you got there ?

2
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:07,297
God !

3
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,856
Baxter ?

4
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:15,157
Ah !

5
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:04,376
He got our dog.

6
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:09,658
He got Baxter.

7
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,621
Shut up, Norman.

8
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,057
Baxter's fertilizer.

9
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:43,579
En everyone's just
standing there like... staring.

10
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,905
Why they'd just catch that thing ?

11
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:54,936
How hard could it be in
a place for dead ends ?

12
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:56,437
Fuck !

13
00:02:56,947 --> 00:02:59,461
Wrists are for girls...

14
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,899
I'm slitting my throat.

15
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,885
You should definatly hang.

16
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,586
Maybe even your final
moment's a cliche around here.

17
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:11,944
Not ours. Bee ours are rock.

18
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:15,736
You don't think our death should be
a little more than a scheap entertainment?

19
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:19,786
You jazzed me on this.
Don't wuss out now.

20
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:24,306
It's the idea of everyone
staring at me just lying there.

21
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:29,083
I mean, what if they just... laugh?

22
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,184
Don't be (???).

23
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:35,386
Bee, suicide is like
the ultimate "fuck you"

24
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:36,987
Come on it's so "us".

25
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:39,588
It's the pact.

26
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:42,547
See, it's easyer for you. You don't care.

27
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,381
We swore we'd go
together, one way or another.

28
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:48,585
When we were eight.
- So ?

29
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:53,860
Out by sixteen or dead in
this scene but together forever.

30
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,902
Together forever.

31
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:08,545
United against life as we know it.

32
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:11,446
Our deaths will be the shit Bee.
Trust me!

33
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,064
To much blood...

34
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:31,107
...and I can see your gonch!
- Just do it.

35
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,422
Please bury me in this dress. Thanks.

36
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,945
I was completly disturbing, wasn't I ?

37
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,501
You now, the Fitzgerald sisters
clearly worked very...

38
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:05,702
God !

39
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,706
I mean...

40
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,907
I am completely sicken.

41
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:14,707
Sicken... by that, wasn't I ?

42
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:21,061
Look, see me at the guidance office,
after class. You tow, separately.

43
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,909
Can we see the ones
with Ginger again ?

44
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,910
No !

45
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:26,911
Hey...

46
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:32,704
'Life in Bailey Downs'.
Who's next ?

47
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:46,706
Oh yes ladies run. Run for daddy!

48
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:49,707
Bounce.

49
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,660
Those she's good to go.

50
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:57,261
You wanna do a Fitzgerald ?
- You're kidding ?

51
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,511
Not the little twig (???)...

52
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,512
...the one with the rack !

53
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,213
The red head.

54
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:06,706
I think McCardy just checked me.

55
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:15,024
Like you care, right ?

56
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,264
High school is just
a mindless breeders machine.

57
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,502
Total hormonal toilet.

58
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,022
I'd rather wait it all out in our room.

59
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,781
Wat is with your back?
- I don't now.

60
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,910
'Search and Destroy'

61
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:39,507
Okay. Trina Sinclair ?

62
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,223
Excellent selection. Continue.

63
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:49,211
Trina Sinclair, D.O.A. at the hair dye aisle.

64
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:53,112
Perished while seeking matching
barrettes on nothing but diet pills and laxatives.

65
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,501
...likes her shorts stuck up her ass crack.

66
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,302
Favourite homework excuse:
my nail glitter ate it.

67
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:04,708
Basic pleasure model.
- Your standard, cumbuckety date bait.

68
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,226
Good one.

69
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,713
Line change. Lest go, girls.
- Fucking Bitches !

70
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,014
Oh. Oh.

71
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:22,310
Lets do this again.

72
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,191
I'll cover you.

73
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,866
Good.

74
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,869
Bounce, baby. Bounce!
Keep running.

75
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,911
You want me baby.

76
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,012
C'mon, honey!

77
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,013
Oh yeah, baby!

78
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,308
You want me baby.
- Fuck off!

79
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:54,851
'The Beast of Bailey Downs'
strikes again.

80
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:56,952
That's four dogs this week.

81
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:59,052
Oh! Whow... Bonus!

82
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:02,387
I guess you D.O.A. on a dog. Completly.

83
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:04,670
That's enough.

84
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,392
Are you OK ?

85
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,990
Terrific.
- That is one mother fucking mad dog.

86
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,110
Brigitte, go get cleaned out.

87
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,028
Don't ever touch my sister again.

88
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:19,503
Stop me. Freak.

89
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,108
Enough ! Break it up !

90
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:42,003
Hey, that janitor is loking
right down your shirt.

91
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:43,704
Sure.

92
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,453
Want me to kill her ?
I kill her for you Bee.

93
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,154
Whatever.

94
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,945
No, not whatever.
This isn't wathever.

95
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,993
Seriously whatabout torture ?

96
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,873
Anything you want.

97
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:03,591
or...
She has that dog.

98
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:08,749
We could kidnap it, make it look like he
got eaten by 'The Beast of Bailey Downs'

99
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:12,590
We got all that blood en fake guts
from the slide show.

100
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,108
Let's do it.

101
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:24,108
She screws a drug dealer.
she's begging for negative attention.

102
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:27,350
So, Sam are you...are you gonna call me?

103
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,504
Okay you have my number right?

104
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,205
Remember when I gave it to you ?

105
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:33,806
Sam.

106
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:35,606
Ok, bye...

107
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:37,868
Let's go.

108
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:42,508
Such a dickhead.

109
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:43,489
See...

110
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,590
You let idiots get
away with fucking you up.

111
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,492
That's why the big Buddha made me...

112
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,193
...to stop them.

113
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,233
Yeah so far you 're really
kicking ass.

114
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:56,034
Just give me one clean shot.
Just one, I fucking promise you.

115
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:59,313
Don't humor me!
- So Fitz...

116
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,711
I think we should get together.

117
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:07,012
Ehm...

118
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,013
No.

119
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,214
Bitch!

120
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,949
Jump, Norman. Come on.

121
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,050
Bee...

122
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,546
Just say you won't go average on me.

123
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,614
Just cause some gonad gets
his zipper going?

124
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,915
I'd rather be dead.

125
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:35,469
Rather die than be here without you.
- Relax, you know I (???)

126
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:38,514
Ginger, don't push your sister.

127
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,317
God, I hate our gene pool.

128
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,950
Look, girls.

129
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:50,515
Come on. Let go. Let go. You're ruin it !

130
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:01,517
Ginger why are you rubbing your back ?

131
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:05,669
It hurts.
- Why ?

132
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:11,753
Well, pain flows up your nerve
endings to the synapses in your brain...

133
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,748
She is not funny.

134
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:17,307
How did you hurt it ?
- Being dead.

135
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:22,069
Does it hurt down by
your tailbone or is it up higher ?

136
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:25,786
Is it tied through out here ?
- Maybe.

137
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:27,993
Does it ache back here ?

138
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:31,710
Mayb...
- Oh my god.

139
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,473
Do you think it's cramps ?

140
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:39,550
Give it a rest... for two seconds ?

141
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:40,951
Pam, we're eating.

142
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:44,088
Henry, the girls are both three years
late menstruating. Okay ?

143
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,097
It's not normal if it's (???) happening...
- It's not.

144
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,994
Honey, it's nothing to be scared off.
It's the most normal thing in the world.

145
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:53,127
Maybe it's cancer of the spine.
- Ginger...

146
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,528
Or tuberculosis.

147
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:58,792
See what your attitude does.
- Or spondylitis.

148
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,189
Spondo... what ?
- Fuses your vertebra together.

149
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,996
Nice.
- Brigitte stop it.

150
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:05,152
Have a fit !

151
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:06,753
I've had just about enough of that tone.

152
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:10,354
That makes two of us. Fuck !
- That's it to your room.

153
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,871
Gladly.

154
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,588
Brigitte you're not connected at her waist.

155
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:22,207
Your father and I have councilling tonight.
I don't want you leaving the house.

156
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,308
The news says there's still
some wild animal on the loose.

157
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,230
They never go out.

158
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,958
Well, you're a big help.

159
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,915
As usual.

160
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:36,597
Ginger.
- What ?

161
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:40,517
We'll get caught.
- No, we won't.

162
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,438
The dog won't even be out.
- He has to pee some time.

163
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,911
People don't leave
their dogs out alone anymore.

164
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:52,312
Then you'll just have to distract her
while I nab the pooch and make with the gore.

165
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:56,757
I can't distract her.
- The fuck, Bee. This is your idea.

166
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,309
If you don't like
your ideas, stop having them.

167
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:09,713
Sorry.
- I just (???)

168
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,518
Check it out.

169
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,790
Now we can even leave a body.
She'll freak.

170
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,472
Oh, wicked.

171
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,829
Teake his...

172
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,512
...leg ?

173
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,396
He's still warm.

174
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,312
Oh gross.

175
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:49,513
Shit !

176
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,718
Leave it then. (???).

177
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,630
You got some on you.

178
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,317
Nice.

179
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,753
What ?

180
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:07,954
Bee...

181
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,310
I just got the curse.

182
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,611
Ehw.

183
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,993
Well, it's not contagious !

184
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,752
I know that.

185
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,053
God !

186
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,549
I mean, kill yourself to be different
and your own body screws you.

187
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,211
But if I start simping
around tampon dispensers...

188
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:29,512
...moaning about PMS, shoot me ok.

189
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,712
Lets get out of here.

190
00:16:58,513 --> 00:16:59,913
Ginger ?

191
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:02,914
Ginger !

192
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,915
Ginger ?

193
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:10,916
Aaah !

194
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:11,917
Ginger !

195
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,318
Ginger !

196
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:43,712
Oh God. He's still right there.

197
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:54,413
Oh, my God !

198
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:04,714
Ginger !

199
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:07,715
Ginger !

200
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,715
Ginger !

201
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,320
Get up. Come on, get up !

202
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:14,516
Oh, fuck me !

203
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,317
Shit !

204
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:36,916
Mom !

205
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,519
Dad ! Help !

206
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:43,498
Let me see.

207
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,999
No, it hurts, it burns...
- I got to see it Ginger.

208
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:52,316
What was it ? What was it ?
- I don't know. A big dog maybe.

209
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,497
What's wrong ?
What did I do ?

210
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:56,498
Shut.

211
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:57,920
I saw this thing once...

212
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:03,721
(???)

213
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,619
It wasn't a fucking bear !

214
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,720
It wasn't any fucking bear !
There isn't anywhere here.

215
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,314
Does it hurt ?
- No.

216
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:21,635
That's impossible.
They 're already healing.

217
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,700
No, this isn't right.  I'm calling 911.

218
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:24,796
- No ! No !

219
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:27,797
Bee, I'm not bleeding anymore. Right ?

220
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:29,943
I mean... just...

221
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,923
...spare me Pam finding out.

222
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:35,713
Okay ? I'm okay, Okay ?

223
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:40,114
Okay.
- I'm okay.

224
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:45,717
I though you're gonna die.
- I'm okay.

225
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,884
Preying upon normal healthy cells...

226
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:32,755
the intruder gradually devours
the host from within...

227
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:37,157
Eventually the invader consumes
its host completely...

228
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:40,715
...and finally destroys it.

229
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:47,398
Complete myosis involves
two successives divisions sequences...

230
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:52,720
...which results in four new
cells, each of which is...

231
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:07,720
This one comes with a free calendar.

232
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,639
Are you sure it's just cramps ?

233
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,919
Just so you know...

234
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,320
...the words ' just ' and
' cramps ' tey don't go together.

235
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,521
Ok, you realy (???)

236
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:36,522
One day, you too will know my pain.

237
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:41,043
Hey, diss me or whatever
but, I got three sisters...

238
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:44,324
...and nothing quite takes
the edge off like a good toke.

239
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:50,042
Well, maybe I like my edge...Thanks.

240
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:54,317
Or maybe you're just chicken to lose it.

241
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:11,317
Pass the fag.

242
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,525
That's a girl.
-Yeah.

243
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,723
An eighth's fifty.

244
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:37,116
I don't want any drugs.
- Then amscray.

245
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,322
I was just wondering
what you hit.

246
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:51,566
Well, officer, looked like
a lycanthrope to me, sir.

247
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:55,725
I know what a lycanthrope is.
- Sure you do.

248
00:23:57,888 --> 00:24:00,527
Think you see werewolves a lot ?

249
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:07,081
Why, do you ?

250
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,201
Is it working ?

251
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:17,718
No ...and now I just don't care.

252
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:26,146
What the hell are you guys doing in here ?

253
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:27,147
Sam, the Man.

254
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,265
Sam, man, we just needed
a place to come and smoke.

255
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,366
Hey, you know, I have an idea.

256
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:36,726
Why don't you guys get
the fuck outta my van, assholes !

257
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:40,324
No I'm serius. Get out !

258
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:46,717
Samuel, what happened in your truck ?
- I (???) a tree, all right. Good bye.

259
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:48,020
Ginge, lets go.

260
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,121
Yeh, why don't you
stick to your own species Fitzenstien ?

261
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,120
Trina, stick my (???)

262
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:07,926
Oh you bitch !
Okay, baby.

263
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:17,924
Ging, what's going on ?

264
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,681
Something's wrong.

265
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,337
Like more than you being just...

266
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:25,638
...female.

267
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:28,919
Can you just say something please ?

268
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,420
Woah !

269
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,448
Woah ? That's it ? 'Woah' ?

270
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,425
I can't have a hairy chest, Bee.

271
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:48,926
That's fucked !

272
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,321
No way.

273
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:57,022
The fuck ? What the fuck ?

274
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,448
This isn't...
- What ?

275
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,761
No way, like...
- What ?

276
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,924
Bitten on a full moon.
Now you're hairy ?

277
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,601
I know, but think about it.

278
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,723
Well thank you for taking my
total fucking nightmare so seriously !

279
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:29,024
Oh shit !

280
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,921
What if I'm dying or something ?

281
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,969
We gotta see the nurse.

282
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,443
I'm sure it seems like a
lot of blood. It's a period.

283
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:48,399
But (???) it was like...

284
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,050
Geyser.

285
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,949
Everyone seems to panic their first time.

286
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,650
Neither of you have had
a period before and you're how old ?

287
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:59,326
I'm almost sixteen, she just
turned fifteen. She skipped a grade.

288
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:04,690
A thick, syrupy, voluminous
discharge is not uncommon.

289
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:09,129
The bulk of the uterine lining is
shed within the first few days.

290
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,489
Contractions, cramps,
squeeze it out like a pump.

291
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,927
In three to five days you'll
find lighter, bright-red bleeding.

292
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:23,326
That may turn to a brownish or blackish
sludge, which signals the end of the flow.

293
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:27,523
OK, so it's all normal ?
- Very !

294
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:33,084
Expected every twenty-eight days,
give or take, for the next thirty years.

295
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,565
Great. Thanks.

296
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:41,805
What about hair that
wasn't there before, and pain ?

297
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:43,928
Uhuh, comes with the territory.

298
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:48,041
Thank you. Lets go Bee.

299
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:53,570
Wait, you'll have to protect
against both pregnancy and STDs now...

300
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,324
Play safe !

301
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,525
Wish this where baby's legs.

302
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,483
Ginger's very favorite.

303
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:39,089
Congratulations sweetie.
You know you can ask me anything.

304
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:41,243
You're so dead.

305
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:42,526
I didn't.

306
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:45,327
Our little girl's a young woman now.

307
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:54,810
I'd never tell her anything.
- Unless you wanted to piss me off !

308
00:28:54,973 --> 00:29:00,923
I want you to be okay.
- I am, I just got my period...ok ?

309
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:05,564
Now, I've got weird hairs, so what ?
That means I've got hormones...

310
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:08,743
...and they may make me butt-ugly,
but they do not make me a monster.

311
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,444
So you got bit by a great big hormone.

312
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,884
Well not by what you think.
They don't exist !

313
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,085
Norman shut the fuck up !

314
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,664
Maybe he's barking at you.

315
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:18,665
Did I change last night ?

316
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:22,366
Howl at the moon, kill shit and
change back this morning ? Huh... No !

317
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,670
Did it take a silver bullet
to stop that thing ? No !

318
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:26,971
It got killed
by a fucking truck.

319
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:31,809
You always blow off anything you don't get.
- Yeah, when it's bullshit !

320
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:36,922
You're doing drugs with guys.
Something is definitely wrong with you.

321
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,891
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I do see a monster.

322
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:44,125
Yeah, it's got these little green eyes.

323
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:47,923
Oh yeah, like I really wish I was haemorrhaging
and hairy and sucking off jason McCarty.

324
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:51,733
Well you always wanted to be me !
- Well this isn't you, so.

325
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:56,526
Oh, poor Bee. I'm growing up
and obviously you're not, huh ?

326
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:00,528
Well don't let me hold you back or anything.
- Oh well don't worry, I won't.

327
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:33,123
Only one creature on earth destroys
for pure plesure. It's a weerwolf.

328
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,329
Oh my god, here it is.

329
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,450
He's hideous !

330
00:30:56,815 --> 00:31:01,525
Get the fuck outta the bathroom !
I'm trying to get ready !

331
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:10,326
Ginger ? Oh my god.

332
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:26,827
Oh babe...

333
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:28,628
Sheck it out.

334
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:11,629
Hello, hello, hello...

335
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,430
Hey !

336
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:24,813
Kid, you got a smoke ?

337
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:26,014
No.

338
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,534
You got a light then?

339
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,228
Oh, thank you.

340
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:37,729
I just spent a week of my life
looking for you. Give me a sec.

341
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:46,927
You dropped this on my truck.

342
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:52,030
Okay, we both saw it.
What the fuck was it ?

343
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:56,031
It's what you hit.
- Hum ! I know...

344
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:58,528
...but what the fuck was it ?

345
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:03,936
See, I flattened an animal.
Furry, all-fours, could be anything...

346
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:07,337
...but here I am thinking 'lycanthrope'

347
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,250
That's crazy, huh?

348
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:14,926
Book me in to the rubber motel,
I'm officially all fucked up, right ?

349
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:17,934
What if you're not ?

350
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:23,845
Well, that would explain
the human circumcised dick...

351
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:26,736
...and why you were
running for your life from it.

352
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:30,928
I have to go. Thanks for my stuff.

353
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:35,730
What's your name ?

354
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:29,255
Bullshit.
- Thanks.

355
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:30,931
No, hey bullshit ?

356
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,608
What do you say ?

357
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:38,338
Swear you won't call a freak show.

358
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,736
Yeah, I swear.

359
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,335
I'm Changing like right now and
full moons have nothing to do with it.

360
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,097
You're serious ?

361
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:57,334
...and everything I look it goes silver
bullet in a gun to my head, the end.

362
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,335
Wow.

363
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:04,247
Lets not panic here. I mean...

364
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:10,692
...for one, that thing on the road,
my van did a pretty good job on it.

365
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,933
What are the benefits of silver bullets ?
So, let's just forget the Hollywood rules.

366
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:21,138
It's got to be a cure right ? Otherwise,
it would be a hell of a lot more of them.

367
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:27,728
It's like an infection, it works
from the inside out. It's like a virus.

368
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:33,178
Biology, there's something
you can sink your teeth into.

369
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,569
So to speak.

370
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:40,255
You're real, your problem's
real, the solution's real.

371
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:44,413
(???)

372
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,535
The again when I  (???) , I got infections...
a girl says try pure silver...  clered up like that.

373
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,172
The ancients thought
pure metals purified the blood.

374
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,538
They thought leeches did too.
- They do.

375
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,738
Hey, why don't you get
your slut-bitch sister a leash ?

376
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,739
What a freak.

377
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,540
A nice bird necklace.

378
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,329
Ginger, a word ?

379
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,018
Is it sorry ?
- No.

380
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,331
Come on Jason, lets go.

381
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:32,332
Oh yes.

382
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,633
Ginger !

383
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,099
Hey. She is ovulating !

384
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,300
- See you freak.
- Bye bye.

385
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:04,018
This is a very exciting,
confusing time for your sister.

386
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:08,254
Boys, her body,
trying to fit in.

387
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:10,678
Maybe if she found that she
could share more with you...

388
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,737
...you'd both be a lot happier.

389
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:19,539
You know, Brigitte,
your turn's coming too ...one day

390
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:33,533
My stomach.

391
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:38,059
Hey, take it easy, allright ?
We've got all night.

392
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:43,618
Sorry, you just taste really good.

393
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:50,494
Just lie back and relax.
- You lie back and relax !

394
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:52,539
Who's the guy here ?

395
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:57,731
Who's the guy here ? Huh ?
Who's the fucking guy here ?

396
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,814
Don't we need protection here ?

397
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:03,212
Stop it !

398
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:04,461
Wait a second !

399
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:07,341
You're fucking hilarious cave boy.

400
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,842
Ginge ?

401
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,540
What happened ?

402
00:38:34,702 --> 00:38:36,738
Did he hurt you ?

403
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:42,096
If he hurt you, you should tell.

404
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:49,597
Oh, my god !

405
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:55,496
Get out ! Get out !
- What happened ?

406
00:38:55,663 --> 00:38:59,133
Something is really... really wrong, Bee.

407
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,539
What happened ?

408
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:07,854
I get this ache and...

409
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:14,371
...I thought it was for sex, but it's
to tear everything into fucking peices.

410
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,341
Where is he ?

411
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:27,536
Next door.

412
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:44,337
Oh, my god !

413
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:47,498
You killed Norman.

414
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:53,216
He barked and he barked and
he kept fucking barking !

415
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:58,417
I just... I just...

416
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:01,256
...I couldn't stop myself.

417
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:06,539
Bee, what am I suppose to do ?

418
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:13,538
It wasn't at all like
I thought it would be...

419
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,300
...there was just all this
squirming and squealing...

420
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:26,935
...and than he's done and you're like 'Oh ?'

421
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:33,343
(???) telling everyone
what a freak I am.

422
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:38,701
They'll say the same thing about hem.

423
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:44,974
It doesn't work like that.
I mean, he got laid.

424
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:51,539
I'm just a lay. He's a hero and
I’m just a lay, a freak mutant lay.

425
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:53,935
Did you use something ?

426
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:56,436
No.

427
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,862
And you think this thing work ?

428
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:09,141
We have to try something.

429
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:15,304
Where did you get that...that ring ?

430
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:17,342
I found it.

431
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:21,061
Too bad.

432
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:26,942
You should have one too.
I mean for being with me on this.

433
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:33,258
Ready ?

434
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,159
Yeah.

435
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:50,139
Shit, it stuck !

436
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:54,979
Hold still.

437
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:58,899
Fuck ! Hurry up !
- Sorry, sorry

438
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:01,745
It's almost there.

439
00:42:08,186 --> 00:42:09,699
How do you feel ?

440
00:42:14,986 --> 00:42:16,499
Wicked.

441
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,900
Norman ?

442
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:28,938
Hey, Norman.

443
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,639
Hurry up !

444
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,940
Hold it still.
- I am, I hurry up.

445
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:14,300
Go ahead, baby.

446
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:27,746
Oh, McCardy what happened to you ?
- Ginger Fitzgerald rocked my world.

447
00:43:29,347 --> 00:43:31,736
(???) rag, too ?

448
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:34,637
Oh, shit !

449
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:36,944
It must be ink. Fuck !

450
00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:48,245
Hi !

451
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,345
Brigitte !

452
00:43:53,148 --> 00:43:54,661
Brigitte, come here.

453
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:58,407
What the fuck, Bee ?
Do you got a boyfriend or something ?

454
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:00,907
No, we just...

455
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:02,786
I'll be right back.

456
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:10,287
Oh my god.

457
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:13,983
Hey, what's up ? Look, if silver's shot,
I've been reading and I got another idea.

458
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:18,539
Are you on drugs, like right now ?
I'm in class here.

459
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:23,941
Yeah, excuse me for giving a shit.

460
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:28,945
I'll come see you later, ok ?
- Whatever.

461
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:37,947
The Fitz sister are really (???).

462
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:44,897
Okay, line change. Lets go.
- He thinks I got bit.

463
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:48,504
I trust you and you (???) the
first fuck up who comes along.

464
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,939
He knows stuff, he wants to help.

465
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:54,306
He wants to get in
your pants, Stupid !

466
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:59,342
So sluts run in the family... quel shocker !

467
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:21,547
Get out !

468
00:45:21,548 --> 00:45:22,548
Ginger, no !

469
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,149
Ginger, no ! Stop !

470
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,150
Fitght, fight, fight...

471
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,939
You started it.
- Ginger to the office.

472
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,744
This school has a zero
tolerance for violence policy...

473
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,042
...I mean a temper like that is inexcusable...

474
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,140
(???) substantial extenuating circumstances.

475
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,661
What are you looking at ? Euh ?
My pen exploded ok. My red pen.

476
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:28,226
That was fucking incredible.
Did you (???)

477
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,665
You gave it to Jason.

478
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:34,340
You had unprotected sex
and you infected him.

479
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,241
Oops !

480
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:44,308
I have to see Sam. He's got an idea.
- Oh bet he does. Well, lets go.

481
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:48,090
If you come,
you can't be weird Ginger.

482
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:50,630
If he gets I lied. If he get

483
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:54,022

484
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:57,740
If he thinks I (???)

485
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:01,343
I'll behave.

486
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:09,141
Romeo, Romeo, wherefor art thou Romeo ?

487
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,065
Sorry about before I was just afraid
someone would hear us, that's all.

488
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:21,466
Yeah, she is just a litlle moody lately.

489
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:24,501
That hole silver thing didn't (???)

490
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:28,109
I wasn't expecting company.

491
00:47:28,271 --> 00:47:31,229
My sister Ginger. She knows.

492
00:47:32,271 --> 00:47:36,549
If you two come in here, you see
sweat fuck all. Understood ?

493
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,550
Jesus !

494
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:48,902
Wicked ! Smoke us up !

495
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:51,540
Yeah, wicked huh ?
Get the fuck out !

496
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:54,951
Hi, Brigitte.

497
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,511
(???)

498
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:59,391
I compared homeopatic treatements...

499
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:02,110

500
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:05,105
Aconitum dilycotonum.

501
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:07,422
Lyko as in wholf ?
- Right.

502
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:12,029
It's called Monkshood. It's a cousin of wolfsbane
except this stuff is safe in small dosis.

503
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:15,468
It's a super oxydent (???) radical detox.

504
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:20,831
It promotes white blood (???) .
- Which fight infection. Do you have some ?

505
00:48:20,992 --> 00:48:24,348
Well, it's prenennial.
It grows everywhere but only in the sping.

506
00:48:24,512 --> 00:48:27,345
Fuck ! This is bullshit ok.

507
00:48:30,152 --> 00:48:33,542
(???).
- She does not have time for that.

508
00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:37,227
She's killed a dog already.
She's fucked.

509
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:38,971
She's going a tail.
Did you tell him that ?

510
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,350
- Ginger !

511
00:48:41,312 --> 00:48:43,348
You growing a tail ?

512
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:45,349
Yes.

513
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:51,268
Look, he's just another wank job. Okay.

514
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,863
- What the fuck do you think you are ?

515
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:58,549
Wat the fuck are you ? Pervert, she's 15 !
- Ginger, wait outside !

516
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:09,944
Fine, if he rapes you,
don't come crying. I'll be at home.

517
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:16,742
She's just freacking.

518
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:20,353
I do not think of you that way.

519
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:57,033
Your dad's battery is dead again.
(???) supermarket.

520
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,033
Wanna go for a ride ?
- Jesus can't you knock ?

521
00:49:59,234 --> 00:50:01,034
Don't you Jesus me.

522
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:04,827
You don't have anything I haven't seen before.
- That's what you think.

523
00:50:04,994 --> 00:50:10,546
What is that suppose to mean ?
- Nothing, i'm just, i'm fat alright get out.

524
00:50:10,714 --> 00:50:15,708
Ginger you are not fat, these
fashion models are all on speed to look like that.

525
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:17,466
Get out !

526
00:50:18,067 --> 00:50:21,367
Ok. Gosh.

527
00:50:21,874 --> 00:50:23,546
I'll be back soon.

528
00:50:41,274 --> 00:50:44,107
Give me back my dog.

529
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:48,473
Trina I don't have your dog.
- Ginger took him. I saw her.

530
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:54,350
Now, I feel sorry for you.
He dosn't like you.

531
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:59,190
He's a cherry-hound. He's in to virgins.

532
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:02,351
Trina you're bleeding. Go home.

533
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:06,349
If you are so fucking smart,
you won't give him the satisfaction.

534
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:09,871
Somebody just once shouldn't give
that fucker the satisfaction!

535
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:13,232
Trina go now.
- You are as very cunt as your sister .

536
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:14,908
I am not.

537
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:18,431
Hi meat. Back for more?
- What are you doing?

538
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:22,965
I don't know, Bee. What am I doing?
Call Sam. Ask the Pro.

539
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:24,466
What ?

540
00:51:24,635 --> 00:51:28,423
You play with your new friends
and I'll play with mine.

541
00:51:28,595 --> 00:51:31,507
Ginger what the hell are you doing ?

542
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:35,384
You smell yummy. What is that?
Citrus? antiseptic? I'm not sure.

543
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:37,352
Are you crasy ?

544
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:43,113
Okay that's enough. Let her go.
- Shut up.

545
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:46,188
Ok, lets just (???).

546
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:49,393
You know what Trina? She is doing (???) .
(???)

547
00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:52,434
Stop, it is not like that.
- I think she scare for you (???)

548
00:51:52,596 --> 00:51:54,314
She is an asshole. She's not worth it.

549
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:56,032
- You ask for this !

550
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,474
You picked Sam over me.
Whatever happens now it is your fault !

551
00:52:00,636 --> 00:52:05,790
This is not you. Just lets cope...
- Oh, with what ? With this kind of shit.

552
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,311
He's wrong (???à). You can't fix this !

553
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:12,594
You don't know that. Just give me a chance.
- What an other one ? God gee, I don't know Bee...

554
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:14,252
...see I'm going way way out there...

555
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:18,149
...way way far from (???) and
your pretty much fucking rules.

556
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:25,427
Oh god, that's disgusting you
fucking gross fucking bitch...

557
00:52:25,596 --> 00:52:30,750
Back, don't touch me you freaks.
You're both just totally fucked.

558
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:32,554
Trina we were just...

559
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:38,555
Oh. Oh.

560
00:52:56,997 --> 00:52:58,350
Get up.

561
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,110
Get up. Now.

562
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:07,950
Henry, what on earth are you doing out there ?

563
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:13,151
Com' on, don't eat it until we get inside.

564
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:21,349
Jesus Christ on a bicycle! What the...?

565
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:29,316
Girls, I told you, no more deaths in the house!
- Don't be mad, it's for extra credit.

566
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:31,945
Back to immaculate in ten minutes.

567
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:37,356
Corn syrup, daddy want some ?

568
00:53:40,877 --> 00:53:43,550
I go to get this meat away.

569
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:46,151
I'll do that.

570
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,388
Mom.
- What ?

571
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:02,954
What do guys want ?

572
00:54:07,238 --> 00:54:11,151
Brigitte, I'm so glad you asked.

573
00:54:15,278 --> 00:54:17,746
That's what men want.

574
00:54:19,638 --> 00:54:23,916
Some of them might seem cool or diffrent
but they are pretty much the same.

575
00:54:24,078 --> 00:54:26,956
Totally.
- Thanks for sharing.

576
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:29,552
Oh, honey, that's what we're here for.

577
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:35,953
Bed time. (???).
Beauty rest.

578
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,316
This is just great.

579
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:57,358
Yeah, feild hockey will suck now.

580
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:02,148
Get me a screwdriver.

581
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,349
Oh, god !

582
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,357
Way to go.

583
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,459
Here it is: 'Why your daughter dates dummys' ?

584
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,460
I'm so glad I held on to this.

585
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,030
I think they're up to something.
- They're just being normal teenage girls.

586
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,356
Then why are they suddenly
so interested in what you have to say ?

587
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,951
Stay in your own little world, Henry.
This one just confuses you.

588
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,598
Shit. (???) worms.

589
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,116
Remember when I used to
make you eat them just to get in here ?

590
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,358
Shallow grave ?
... oh well, seems appropriate.

591
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,756
You dig for a while.

592
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,718
Look...

593
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,338
No one ever thinks chicks do shit like this.

594
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,596
Trust me, a girl can only be a slut...

595
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:50,595
...a bitch, a tease, or the virgin next door.

596
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,758
We'll just coast on how the world works.

597
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,359
Think she's pretty ?

598
00:57:03,481 --> 00:57:05,949
If I wasn't here, would you eat her ?

599
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,150
No.

600
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:14,960
God, that'd be like, fucking her.
- You can't go out anymore.

601
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,157
Well I can't stay in, I'll go mental.

602
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,637
We'll make Pam think you're at school.

603
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:33,873
We'll make school think you're home sick.

604
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:37,351
Just sure there is no doubt about us in this.

605
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:42,151
Then we blow, as far away from here as possible.

606
00:57:55,762 --> 00:57:58,071
Your attention. Please.

607
00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:01,100
(???) immediatelly certain students
wil be (???) to the office...

608
00:58:01,101 --> 00:58:05,159
...to assist the police regarding
Trina Sinclair's dissapear.

609
00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:06,640
She is dead, men.

610
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:09,759
When your name is called,
please come to the office.

611
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:29,352
Is Ginger avoiding me ?

612
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:35,041
...cuz I'am feel pretty good right now.

613
00:58:35,202 --> 00:58:37,875
I just got a few questions for her, like uh...

614
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:40,561
I'm growing a goddamn tail outta my ass...

615
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:44,880
...and I thought she might have a few tips
on how to deal with keeping that quiet !

616
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:50,117
Hurting me won't help.
- See? I'm up to some whack shit right now.

617
00:58:50,283 --> 00:58:53,832
I'm way out on the corner of 'Fucked-Up and Evil'.

618
00:58:54,883 --> 00:58:58,842
You wanna know what I did for fun last night, huh?

619
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:03,394
I killed my own freakin' dog, OK ?
What am I suppose to do about that ?

620
00:59:03,563 --> 00:59:07,875
You gonna be in deep shit.
- I'm right in your deep shit...

621
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:09,954
...and I think you konw why.

622
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:13,953
What's going on here ?

623
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,154
Thanks.

624
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:32,637
Ginger, how was school today ?
- I don't know, I didn't go.

625
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,694
We had a field trip.
- Really ?

626
00:59:34,795 --> 00:59:37,195
I didn't sign any form for a field trip.

627
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:43,715
Daddy, will you teatch me how to drive tonight ?
- Next year. Maybe.

628
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:44,921
So where did you go ?

629
00:59:44,922 --> 00:59:47,559
What if next year never comes ?
- Ginger.

630
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:51,823
Mr. Wayne called today.
He wanted to know if you where feeling any beter.

631
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:54,323
When you might be
comming back to school.

632
00:59:54,484 --> 00:59:58,238
De police wanna talk to you
something about a fight with a missing girl.

633
00:59:58,404 --> 01:00:01,157
Daddy, might I be excused ?
- No, you might not.

634
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:05,002
Ginge whait.
- For what Bee ?

635
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:07,602
Oh. No, no.

636
01:00:12,564 --> 01:00:15,362
I want to know what's going on. Right now.

637
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:24,194
What are these ?
- Monkshood. Brigitte...

638
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:28,960
Where did you get them ?
- From a grave store. Now, I want an answer.

639
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:37,762
Trina Sinclair tried to beat me up,
cause Jason McCardy liked us beter...

640
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:42,042
...so Ginger beat her up. That's all.
- That's all ?

641
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:45,480
Beating up other girls ? Cutting classes ?

642
01:00:46,525 --> 01:00:49,642
I'm very disappointed, Brigitte.
- Sorry.

643
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:53,878
You just do whatever she wants you to.
You always have.

644
01:00:54,045 --> 01:00:56,957
I really wish you'd start thinking more for yourself.

645
01:01:00,205 --> 01:01:03,265
Do you think I should talk to her ?

646
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,325
Check in ?

647
01:01:06,365 --> 01:01:10,404
She thinks it's cool you let us
figure stuff out for herselfs.

648
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:11,405
Oh ?

649
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:14,558
Really ?

650
01:01:17,565 --> 01:01:19,715
I wandered if that (???).

651
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,955
Look what Pamela had.

652
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:29,162
What are you doing ? Stop !
- I'll just take it off.

653
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:30,163
No !

654
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:36,835
I killed their pets Bee, and nothing helps
except tearing life things to pieces.

655
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:39,200
I can't be like this.

656
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:44,564
This is monkshood. First thing tomorrow
we find out how we use it and we take off.

657
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:50,764
You give up now and leave me here
alone, I would never do that to you!

658
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,958
I 'm sorry. I 'm just scared.

659
01:02:19,759 --> 01:02:22,759
BCX radio wish you a happy hallowe'en...

660
01:02:49,707 --> 01:02:54,080
Bee, what the fuck are you doing ?

661
01:02:54,247 --> 01:02:57,124
Hey... Bee, let me out !

662
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:01,519
I have to deal with the cure. This way,
you can't hurt yourself or anybody else.

663
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:07,956
Fuck you. You fucking sissy little girl.
You're going let me out ?

664
01:03:08,127 --> 01:03:10,004
Just shut up and wait for me.

665
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,965
(???) little bitch ! Fuck you !

666
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:19,042
Bee let me out. Come on.

667
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:20,043
Bee ?

668
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:22,544
Bee !

669
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:24,440
Let me out !

670
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:40,642
Holly shit, that's monshood.
How the fuck did you get that ?

671
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:45,066
I don't know if you smoke it or eat it
or what but I need to try it now.

672
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,676
Well, you got me but...

673
01:03:49,848 --> 01:03:54,763
...to be sure, I 'ld have to say direct road. Inject it.

674
01:03:55,808 --> 01:04:00,518
But see, that's a bad idea Brigitte, because
neither of us know what this stuff does.

675
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:03,361
It can't be worst than being road killed.

676
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,602
The dose should be a guess. I mean...

677
01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:13,764
It have to be, there is no way to match for
metabolism, bodyweight it could be side effects.

678
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:19,160
You can not try this alone.
- My sister will be there.

679
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:41,964
Understand you may kill her trying to save her.

680
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:44,965
What ?

681
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:46,960
It's for Ginger, isn't it?

682
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:54,760
Look, worst-case scenario,
you put her out of her misery.

683
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,960
Just as long as you're prepared
for that, and I mean sure.

684
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,365
Try to come to that.

685
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,764
Hey, have you seen Jason ?

686
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:34,085
Umm... you got a little...

687
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,962
You 're going to
the greenhouse bash tonight ?

688
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:37,663
Ehm, yeah.
-Good.

689
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:41,361
I'm in charge of the prizes.
You, too, could be winner.

690
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,367
Ginger. My office. Now.

691
01:06:54,368 --> 01:06:55,668
Help ! Help !

692
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:05,169
Help ! Help !

693
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,064
Let me go.

694
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:11,366
Let him go, McCardy.

695
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:18,285
Oh yeah, a chick. Excellent.

696
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,526
Come to pap baby.

697
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:23,568
Come and get some candy.

698
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:58,770
I have to go.

699
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:02,363
I've a class.

700
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:10,264
Attention please...

701
01:08:10,364 --> 01:08:12,564
...Brigitte Fitzgerald please report to guidance...

702
01:08:12,665 --> 01:08:14,365
...Brigitte Fitzerald to guidance.

703
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:42,285
He wanted to call fucking Pamela,
Bee and tell her we needed help.

704
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:48,972
So, I stop him. You see how that works ?
How I would not betray you ?

705
01:08:50,413 --> 01:08:52,369
I didn't betray you.

706
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:59,572
You locked me up.

707
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,573
You need to get this fixed.

708
01:09:06,693 --> 01:09:12,484
Why ? So I can go to the jail,
for the rest of my life ?

709
01:09:15,813 --> 01:09:18,805
We wait till everyone leaves.

710
01:09:18,973 --> 01:09:22,966
...dan we'll clean this up, some how.

711
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:26,767
I think you've fucked up enough.

712
01:09:37,468 --> 01:09:39,668
Oh my god !

713
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:43,269
Henry ?
- Oh god...

714
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:46,726
What is it ?

715
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:54,763
Henry, (???)
It's only girl's death project.

716
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:58,565
Tey are fake, you big baby.

717
01:10:37,294 --> 01:10:40,366
I'm gonna find something to clean this up.

718
01:10:40,534 --> 01:10:43,651
Stay here and lock the door.

719
01:11:58,652 --> 01:11:59,952
Oh my god !

720
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:18,753
Hello, Birgitte.

721
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:21,615
Stop it !
- Can I touch your boobies ?

722
01:12:21,616 --> 01:12:23,374
I like little girls.

723
01:12:23,536 --> 01:12:24,972
Leave him alone !

724
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:26,573
Ginger. Stop ! Stop !

725
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:27,674
Ginger, fucking stop !

726
01:12:28,075 --> 01:12:29,075
Please stop !

727
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:34,767
Ginger stop ! He hasn't done anyting !

728
01:12:34,936 --> 01:12:37,769
I don't like how he looks at you.

729
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,770
Oh my god !

730
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:05,727
He found me. Brigitte...

731
01:13:06,777 --> 01:13:09,974
...the mess I had to.
- Go to hell.

732
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:22,971
He's not dead, and you infected him.

733
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,368
Let me call help for him.

734
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,569
Oh fuck !

735
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,770
Fuck !

736
01:13:39,817 --> 01:13:41,728
You like it.

737
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:46,151
It feels so... good, Brigitte.

738
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:50,687
Its like touching yourself.

739
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:54,976
You know every move...
right on the fucking dot.

740
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:57,447
And after...

741
01:13:57,618 --> 01:14:02,169
... you see fucking fireworks, supernovas.

742
01:14:04,018 --> 01:14:06,373
I'm a goddamn force of nature.

743
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:12,778
I feel like I could do
just about anything.

744
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:22,127
You know we're almost not
even related anymore.

745
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:24,368
You're fucked !

746
01:14:26,178 --> 01:14:32,094
You love it. Should come for the ride.
A little scratch. Swap some juice.

747
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:36,046
We'll be our own pack, like before.
It's so 'us' Bee.

748
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:39,210
I'd rather be dead than be what you are.

749
01:14:40,258 --> 01:14:41,756
We have a pact !

750
01:14:40,857 --> 01:14:46,254
Out by sixteen or dead on the
scene, but together for fucking ever !

751
01:14:47,298 --> 01:14:49,494
I said I would die for you!

752
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:54,972
No. You said you'd die with me.
Cause you had nothing better to do.

753
01:14:57,979 --> 01:14:59,332
Fuck you too.

754
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:04,338
You think I wanna go back to being nobody ?

755
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:06,937
You're fucked !

756
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:10,777
Go the hell out of my way, Brigitte.

757
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:14,573
And I tell Sam you said Hi.

758
01:15:56,474 --> 01:15:58,574
Stop ! Stop !

759
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,569
Where is your sister ?

760
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,015
In coutry greenhouse.

761
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,533
Get in the van.

762
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,976
All right, Fitz. Wicked, kostum baby.

763
01:17:04,741 --> 01:17:06,254
Where is Sam ?

764
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:14,855
Shit !

765
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:18,656
Hey.

766
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:23,531
Hey Ginger, where is Brigitte ?
- She couldn't make it.

767
01:17:24,581 --> 01:17:26,936
Yeah why is that ?
- Cramps.

768
01:17:28,501 --> 01:17:30,173
She says Hi.

769
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:35,371
You wanna buy or something ?

770
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:37,020
Or something.

771
01:17:48,942 --> 01:17:51,695
Go get your sister.
- Mom, I don't think...

772
01:17:51,862 --> 01:17:54,535
You've done a terrible thing.

773
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:56,636
But...

774
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:01,381
...you're my tiny babys.

775
01:18:02,462 --> 01:18:07,775
As one thing if you leave, it's almost normal
but no one is gonna take you from me.

776
01:18:09,182 --> 01:18:12,702
First thing tomorrow I'll let the house
fill up with gas, and light a match.

777
01:18:12,703 --> 01:18:14,403
What ?

778
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:18,580
We start fresh.
Just us girls. It will be fun.

779
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:21,855
What about dad ?

780
01:18:22,942 --> 01:18:26,776
He'll just blame me,
tey all will.

781
01:18:31,382 --> 01:18:33,771
This isn't your fault, mom.

782
01:18:40,902 --> 01:18:42,415
Yes it is.

783
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,974
Lock the doors. Okay.

784
01:18:57,383 --> 01:19:00,978
Ginger, come on.
- No, you come on.

785
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:06,375
What are you doing ?
- I know you want too. Everybody does.

786
01:19:08,023 --> 01:19:12,221
Really. What have you like ?

787
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,101
What would I do ?

788
01:19:15,143 --> 01:19:20,900
What would I feel like inside ?
- Ginger, stop.

789
01:19:21,063 --> 01:19:24,373
Take me.
- Ginger, your sister...

790
01:19:48,374 --> 01:19:49,374
This is fucked !

791
01:19:50,904 --> 01:19:55,534
Ginger, get out from me.

792
01:19:58,344 --> 01:19:59,982
Jerk !

793
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:02,374
What ? I told you to stop.

794
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:07,862
God, Ginger get up. I'm sorry.

795
01:20:07,863 --> 01:20:09,580
Get up, Ginger.

796
01:20:13,224 --> 01:20:18,981
You bitch. You want me ? You want me ?
Stop hurting everybody else and take me !

797
01:20:19,144 --> 01:20:22,580
I don't want you ! I don't even know you !

798
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:27,981
Brigitte don't.

799
01:20:33,944 --> 01:20:35,343
Brigitte don't !

800
01:20:36,384 --> 01:20:39,774
You wrecked everything for me
that isn't about you.

801
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:46,775
No. Shit.

802
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,583
Now I am you.

803
01:20:53,345 --> 01:20:56,781
I know you are. But what am I ?

804
01:20:59,425 --> 01:21:01,381
We got to go.

805
01:21:32,145 --> 01:21:35,376
Bee I can't.
I'm turning too fast.

806
01:21:40,665 --> 01:21:44,681
What the hell did you do that for ?
- I won't let you do this Brigitte.

807
01:21:44,882 --> 01:21:47,298
You both need help.

808
01:21:47,465 --> 01:21:49,934
You fucking idiot.

809
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:53,542
The cure works. I had to use it on
somebody else but there is more at the house.

810
01:21:53,706 --> 01:21:56,282
This is the only way I could
get her to come back with me.

811
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:57,983
Oh shit !

812
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:00,981
What ? How I'm supposed to know that ?

813
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:08,300
Just help me. OK ?
Just get her in your truck and drive us home.

814
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:11,458
Fine, she rides in the back.

815
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:26,580
This is nuts, you need a doctor.

816
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:31,881
Oh !

817
01:22:32,382 --> 01:22:33,481
Jesus.

818
01:22:36,226 --> 01:22:39,536
She could have killed you Brigitte.

819
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:42,504
She needs me.

820
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,454
Get home. Cure her, cure me.

821
01:22:47,506 --> 01:22:49,702
And then ?

822
01:22:49,867 --> 01:22:51,346
Run.

823
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:55,376
You know you're kidding yourself.

824
01:23:40,947 --> 01:23:44,383
I'll be right back. Give me the syringe.

825
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,961
Dad ? Hello ?

826
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:54,962
Oh shit !

827
01:23:58,108 --> 01:24:00,383
I had to fix that.

828
01:24:01,988 --> 01:24:05,583
Did she get out ?
- Oh god, I hope not.

829
01:24:06,628 --> 01:24:08,584
I can't see anything.

830
01:24:11,148 --> 01:24:12,979
(???) me that flashlight.

831
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,880
Fuck !

832
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:45,988
It was your god damn sister !

833
01:24:49,989 --> 01:24:51,089
Oh fuck !

834
01:24:54,109 --> 01:24:56,259
The monkshood is in there.

835
01:24:57,309 --> 01:24:59,777
Oh, you're out of your mind.

836
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,182
Not yet.

837
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:06,983
Be quiet. I gotta get this stuff.

838
01:25:13,584 --> 01:25:14,584
Great.

839
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:43,977
Fuck ! Where the fuck is she ?

840
01:25:47,378 --> 01:25:48,378
Shut.

841
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:10,984
Lets do this fast.
- Oh yes.

842
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:17,588
Allright, golds.

843
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:20,822
Alcohol.

844
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:29,123
Brigitte...

845
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:35,588
...have you a lighter ?
- I can't feel my hand.

846
01:26:36,589 --> 01:26:37,589
Jesus Christ.

847
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,590
Oh fuck !

848
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:44,383
Go ! Go !

849
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:57,188
Alcohol.
- What ?

850
01:26:57,389 --> 01:26:58,789
Oh shit. Yeah.

851
01:27:02,711 --> 01:27:04,781
Start (???) up the buds.

852
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,383
Put in.

853
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:17,862
Easy, easy, easy...

854
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:21,344
What was that ?

855
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,985
Shit keep going. Go, go...

856
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:30,104
I handle this.

857
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:40,786
Great, that's real fucking hygienic.
- I doubt it matters.

858
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:47,205
How about you take this and we blow ?

859
01:27:47,306 --> 01:27:49,380
How about No ?

860
01:27:51,872 --> 01:27:53,823
Then let me do it, you can hardly move.

861
01:27:53,824 --> 01:27:54,924
No !

862
01:27:56,072 --> 01:27:58,188
You can't do this by yourself.

863
01:27:59,432 --> 01:28:02,007
Let me take the needle,
I'll go into the livingroom...

864
01:28:02,008 --> 01:28:05,382
...you lead her in bam we're done.

865
01:28:10,383 --> 01:28:11,983
Okay.

866
01:28:20,352 --> 01:28:22,991
I'm going.
- Be careful.

867
01:31:33,892 --> 01:31:35,392
Sam ?

868
01:32:09,693 --> 01:32:11,293
Ginger ?

869
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,471
I can't.

870
01:33:55,318 --> 01:33:56,831
I won't.

871
01:33:58,732 --> 01:34:00,832
Fuck !

872
01:34:50,678 --> 01:34:52,192
Fuck off !

873
01:34:54,959 --> 01:34:56,472
Let me alone !

874
01:36:28,873 --> 01:36:30,873
Ginger ?

875
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,595
Come on. It's me.

876
01:36:39,696 --> 01:36:41,096
Okay ?

877
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,789
Ginger, please it's me !

878
01:36:56,721 --> 01:36:58,234
You want this ?

879
01:37:02,881 --> 01:37:04,394
You want this ?

880
01:37:18,961 --> 01:37:21,998
I'm not dying in this room with you !

881
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:27,954
I'm not dying !

882
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:57,479
English subtitel: Yaza.
