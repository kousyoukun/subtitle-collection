1
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,569
What have you got there?

2
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:11,114
God!

3
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,076
Baxter?

4
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,632
He got our dog!

5
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,095
He got Baxter!

6
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,564
Shut up, Norman.

7
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:32,487
<i>Can this happen to a normal woman?</i>

8
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,749
Baxter's fertilizer.

9
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,254
And everyone's just
standing there like...

10
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:51,631
...staring.

11
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:56,052
Why don't they just catch that thing?

12
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:03,268
How hard could it be
in a place full of dead ends?

13
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,102
Fuck!

14
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,564
Wrists are for girls...

15
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,650
I'm slitting my throat.

16
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,696
You should definitely hang.

17
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,615
Maybe even your final moment is
a cliché around here.

18
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:18,491
Not ours.

19
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,618
B, ours will rock.

20
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:25,081
You don't think our deaths should be
a little more than cheap entertainment?

21
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,294
You jazzed me on this.
Don't wuss out now.

22
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:34,007
It's the idea of everyone
staring at me just lying there.

23
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,887
I mean, what if they just... laugh?

24
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:41,055
They'll be in awe.

25
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,560
B, suicide is like
the ultimate "fuck you".

26
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,228
Come on it's so us.

27
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,897
It's the pact.

28
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:53,026
See, it's easy for you.
You don't care.

29
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,987
We swore we'd go together,
one way or another.

30
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:59,324
- When we were eight.
- So?

31
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,871
Out by sixteen or dead in this scene,
but together forever.

32
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,213
Together forever.

33
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,510
United against life as we know it.

34
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,139
Us dead will be the shit, B.
Trust me.

35
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,696
Too much blood.

36
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:43,701
- And I can see your gonch!
- Just do it.

37
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,724
All right, all right... uh.

38
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,728
Well that was completely...

39
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,231
...disturbing, wasn't it?

40
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:22,568
You know, the Fitzgerald sisters
clearly worked very...

41
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:24,862
God!

42
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,948
I mean I, I...

43
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,242
I am completely sickened.

44
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:34,288
Sickened... by that, wasn't I?

45
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,878
Look, see me in the guidance office,
after class, you two, separately.

46
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,882
Can we see the ones
of Ginger again?

47
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:45,925
Enough!

48
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:46,968
Hey!

49
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,013
Life in Bailey Downs, huh?

50
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:52,807
Who's next?

51
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,613
Oh yes, ladies, run. Run for daddy!

52
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,741
Bounce.

53
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,955
I bet she's good to go.

54
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,666
- You wanna do a Fitzgerald?
- You're kidding?

55
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,919
Not the little dweeb, you goinks.
The one with the rack!

56
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,337
The redhead.

57
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,006
Odd.

58
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,468
I think McCardy just checked me.

59
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,100
Like you care, right?

60
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,521
High school is just
a mindless little breeders machine.

61
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,857
A total hormonal toilet.

62
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,527
I'd rather wait it all out in our room.

63
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,491
- What is with your back?
- I don't know.

64
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,785
Hey, 'Search and Destroy'. Go.

65
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,251
OK, Trina Sinclair.

66
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,633
Excellent selection. Continue.

67
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,678
Trina Sinclair, D.O.A.
at the hair dye aisle.

68
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:16,849
Perished while seeking matching barrettes
on nothing but diet pills and laxatives.

69
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,268
Likes her shorts stuck up her ass crack.

70
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:22,271
Favorite homework excuse:
my nail glitter ate it.

71
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,398
Basic pleasure model.

72
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:29,237
Your standard, cumbuckety date bait.

73
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,281
Good one.

74
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:36,285
- Line change. Let's go, girls.
- Fucking Bitch!

75
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:38,746
Uh oh.

76
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,296
Let's do this again.

77
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,298
We'll try it over Sara, thanks.

78
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,425
I'll cover you.

79
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,136
Good.

80
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:04,564
Bounce, babies, bounce!
Keep running.

81
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,065
<i>You want it baby.</i>

82
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:07,733
<i>C'mon, honey!</i>

83
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:08,859
<i>Oh yeah, baby!</i>

84
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,364
- You want it, baby.
- Fuck off!

85
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,247
'The Beast of Bailey Downs' strikes again.

86
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,374
That's four dogs this week.

87
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,626
Oh! Wow... Bonus!

88
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:29,088
I guess you're D.O.A. on a dog.
Huh, Fitz-face?

89
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,631
That's enough.

90
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,218
- Are you OK?
- Terrific.

91
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:37,013
That is one mother-fucking mad dog.

92
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,223
Brigitte, go get cleaned up.

93
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,353
Don't ever touch my sister again.

94
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,606
Stop me, freak.

95
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,402
Enough! Break it up!

96
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,338
Hey, that janitor was looking
right down your shirt.

97
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:11,130
Sure.

98
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,925
Want me to kill her?
I'll kill her for you, B.

99
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:15,968
Whatever.

100
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:21,807
No, not whatever.
This isn't whatever.

101
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,977
Seriously, what about torture?

102
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,937
Anything you want.

103
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:32,902
Or... she has that dog.

104
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,282
We could kidnap it, make it look like he
got eaten by 'The Beast of Bailey Downs'.

105
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,327
We got all that blood and fake guts
from the slide show.

106
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,913
Yeah, that's wicked.
Let's do it.

107
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,086
Hi Sam, how are you?

108
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:54,298
She screws a drug dealer;
she's begging for negative attention.

109
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,677
So, Sam are you... are you gonna call me?

110
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,512
OK, you have my number, right?

111
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,723
Remember when I gave it to you, before?

112
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,392
Sam.

113
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,268
OK, bye...

114
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,646
Let's go.

115
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,484
Such a dickhead.

116
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:14,485
See...

117
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:17,738
You'd let idiots get away
with fucking you up.

118
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,615
That's why the big Buddha made me.

119
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:21,492
To stop them.

120
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,536
Yeah, so far you're really kicking ass.

121
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,623
Just give me one clean shot.
Just one, I fucking promise you.

122
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:31,001
- Don't humor me!
- So, Fitz...

123
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,796
I think we should get together.

124
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:41,095
No.

125
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,560
Bitch!

126
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,523
Jump, Norman. Come on.

127
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:55,735
B...

128
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,362
Just say you won't go average on me.

129
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,906
Just 'cause some gonad gets
his zipper going?

130
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,908
Rather be dead.

131
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:08,748
- I'd rather die than be here without you.
- Relax, you're not, you big suck.

132
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,500
Ginger, don't push your sister.

133
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,504
God, I hate our gene pool.

134
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,215
Look, girls.

135
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,971
Come on. Let go. Let go.
You're ruining it!

136
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,858
Ginger, why are you rubbing your back?

137
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,196
- It hurts.
- Why?

138
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:46,577
Well, pain flows up your nerve endings
to the synapses in your brain...

139
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:48,662
She's not funny.

140
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:52,374
- How did you hurt it?
- Being dead.

141
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,296
Does it hurt down by your tail bone,
or is it up higher?

142
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:01,175
- Is it tight throughout here?
- Maybe.

143
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,469
Does it ache back here?

144
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,348
- Might...
- Oh my god.

145
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,311
Do you think it's cramps?

146
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,439
Give it a rest... for two seconds?

147
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:16,982
Pam, we're eating.

148
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,194
Henry, the girls are both three years
late menstruating. OK?

149
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,154
It's not normal.
If it's finally happening...

150
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,364
It's not!

151
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:27,451
Honey, it's nothing to be scared of.
It's the most normal thing in the world.

152
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,037
- Maybe it's cancer of the spine.
- Ginger-Ann...

153
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:32,206
Or tuberculosis.

154
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,626
- See what your attitude does?
- Or spondylitis.

155
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:39,129
- Spondo...what?
- Fuses your vertebrae together.

156
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,006
- Nice.
- Brigitte, stop it.

157
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,132
Have a fit!

158
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,884
I've had just about enough of that tone.

159
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,638
- That makes two of us. Fuck!
- That's it. To your room!

160
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:48,848
Gladly.

161
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,187
Brigitte, you are not
connected at her wrist.

162
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,900
Your father and I have counseling tonight.
I don't want you leaving the house.

163
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:03,237
The news says there's still
some wild animal on the loose.

164
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,239
They never go out.

165
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,075
Well, you're a big help.

166
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,577
As usual.

167
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,040
- Ginger.
- What?

168
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,086
- We'll get caught.
- No, we won't.

169
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,216
- The dog won't even be out.
- He has to pee some time.

170
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,719
People don't leave
their dogs out alone anymore.

171
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,178
Then you will just have to distract her

172
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,390
while I nab the pooch
and make with the gore.

173
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:36,020
- I can't distract her.
- The fuck, B. This is your idea.

174
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,732
If you don't like your ideas,
stop having them.

175
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:46,822
<i>Sorry.</i>

176
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,075
I've just just had it
with eating all their shit, OK?

177
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,623
Check it out.

178
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:02,129
Now we can even leave a body.
She'll freak.

179
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:03,339
Oh, wicked.

180
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,384
Take his...

181
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,136
...leg?

182
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,438
He's still warm.

183
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,782
Oh, gross.

184
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,033
Shit!

185
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,411
Leave it then. The drag.

186
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:38,499
You got some on you.

187
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,668
Nice.

188
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,216
What?

189
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,260
<i>B,</i>

190
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,764
I just got the curse.

191
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,099
Eww.

192
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,644
Well, it's not contagious!

193
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,479
I know that.

194
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:01,814
God!

195
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:06,527
I mean, kill yourself to be different
and your own body screws you.

196
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,196
But if I start simping
around tampon dispensers

197
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,741
and moaning about PMS, shoot me, OK?

198
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,676
Let's get out of here.

199
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,440
Ginger?

200
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,568
Ginger!

201
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,824
Ginger?

202
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:56,994
Ginger!

203
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,624
Ginger!

204
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:30,110
Oh God. He's right behind me.

205
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,288
Oh, my God!

206
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,007
Ginger!

207
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,135
Ginger!

208
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,520
Ginger!

209
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,298
Get up. Come on, get up!

210
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,830
Oh, fuck me.

211
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,718
Shit!

212
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,603
Mom!

213
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,899
Dad! Help!

214
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:34,902
Let me see.

215
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,698
- No, it hurts, it burns...
- I have to see it, Ginger.

216
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:44,244
- What was it? What was it?
- I don't know. A big dog, maybe.

217
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,456
That's not...
What did I do? What...

218
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,540
Shh.

219
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,001
I saw this thing once, on bears.

220
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,089
Said a bear will like, come after
a girl on the rag, because of the smell.

221
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,966
It wasn't a fucking bear!

222
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,303
There wasn't any fucking bears
anywhere near here.

223
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,142
- Does that hurt?
- No.

224
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:14,775
That's impossible.
They're already healing.

225
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,902
No, this isn't right. I'm calling 911.

226
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,070
No! No!

227
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,198
B, I'm not bleeding anymore. Right?

228
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,408
I mean... just...

229
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,535
...spare me Pam finding out.

230
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:29,498
OK? I'm OK. OK?

231
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,044
- OK.
- I'm OK.

232
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,883
- I thought you were gonna die.
- I'm OK.

233
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,844
<i>Preying upon normal healthy cells,</i>

234
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:28,932
<i>the intruder gradually devours
the host from within.</i>

235
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:33,520
<i>Eventually the invader consumes
its host completely,</i>

236
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:37,232
<i>and finally destroys it.</i>

237
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:44,197
<i>Complete meiosis involves
two successive division sequences,</i>

238
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:49,786
<i>which result in four new cells,
each of which is haploid.</i>

239
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,385
This one comes with a free calendar.

240
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,601
Are you sure it's just cramps?

241
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,021
Just so you know...

242
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:20,609
...the words 'just' and 'cramps',
they don't go together.

243
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,204
OK, you're really girling out here.

244
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,457
One day, you too will know my pain.

245
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:40,128
Hey, diss me or whatever,
but I got three sisters...

246
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,548
...and nothing quite takes
the edge off like a good toke.

247
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:49,513
Well, maybe I like my edge, thanks.

248
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,975
Or maybe you're just chicken to lose it.

249
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,701
Just pass it, fag.

250
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,252
- That a girl.
- Yeah.

251
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,973
An eighth's fifty.

252
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,603
- I don't want any drugs.
- Then amscray.

253
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,111
I was just wondering
what you hit.

254
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:53,660
Well, officer,
it looked like a lycanthrope to me, sir.

255
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:58,039
- I know what a lycanthrope is.
- Sure you do.

256
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,003
Think you see werewolves a lot?

257
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:09,843
<i>Why, do you?</i>

258
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,224
Is it working?

259
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,937
No... but now I just don't care.

260
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,654
What the hell are you guys doing in here?

261
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:30,780
Sam, the Man.

262
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,950
Sam, man, we just needed
a place to come and smoke.

263
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,244
Hey, you know, I have an idea.

264
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,790
Why don't you guys
get the fuck out of my van, assholes!

265
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,334
No I'm serious. Get out!

266
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,877
Get out.
Get out!

267
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:51,176
- Samuel, what happened to your truck?
- I tapped a tree, all right. Good bye.

268
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,469
Ginge, lets go.

269
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,721
Yeah, why don't you
stick to your own species Fitzenstein?

270
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,806
Trina, stick my fist.

271
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:13,281
Oh you bitch!
It's OK, baby.

272
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,750
Ginge, what's going on?

273
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,629
Something's wrong.

274
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,339
Like more than you being just...

275
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,341
...female.

276
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,178
Can you just say something, please?

277
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,233
Woah!

278
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:52,404
'Woah'? That's it? 'Woah'?

279
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,949
I can't have a hairy chest, B.
That's fucked!

280
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:58,785
No way.

281
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,541
The fuck? What the fuck?

282
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,002
- This isn't...
- What?

283
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,129
- No way, like...
- What?

284
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:14,926
Bitten on a full moon.
Now you're hairy?

285
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,724
I know, but think about it.

286
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,062
Well thank you for taking my
total fucking nightmare so seriously!

287
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:37,866
Oh shit!

288
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,953
What if I'm dying or something?

289
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,627
We gotta see the nurse.

290
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:53,923
I'm sure it seems like a lot of blood.
It's a period.

291
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:58,053
But really it was like a...

292
00:27:58,261 --> 00:27:59,763
geyser.

293
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,724
Everyone seems to panic their first time.

294
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,602
Neither of you have had
a period before and you're how old?

295
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,439
I'm almost 16, she just turned 15.
She skipped a grade.

296
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:15,028
A thick, syrupy, voluminous discharge
is not uncommon.

297
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:19,658
The bulk of the uterine lining
is shed within the first few days.

298
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:24,245
Contractions, cramps,
squeeze it out like a pump.

299
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,832
In three to five days you'll find
lighter, bright-red bleeding.

300
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:33,838
That may turn to a brownish or blackish
sludge, which signals the end of the flow.

301
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,843
- OK, so it's all normal?
- Very!

302
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:44,641
Expect it every twenty eight days,
give or take, for the next thirty years.

303
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,269
Great. Thanks.

304
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:53,233
What about hair
that wasn't there before, and pain?

305
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:55,944
Mhm, comes with the territory.

306
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,240
Well, thank you.
Lets go, B.

307
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:06,037
Wait, you'll have to protect
against both pregnancy and STDs now...

308
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,247
Play safe!

309
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,534
Wish these where babies' legs.

310
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,705
Ginger's very favorite.

311
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:53,460
Congratulations sweetie.
You know you can ask me anything.

312
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,295
You're so dead.

313
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,921
I didn't.

314
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,966
Our little girl's a young woman now.

315
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,851
- I'd never tell her anything.
- Unless you wanted to piss me off!

316
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:16,232
- I want you to be OK.
- I am! I just got my period, OK?

317
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:21,070
Now, I've got weird hairs, so what?
That means I've got hormones,

318
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,324
and they may make me butt-ugly,
but they do not make me a monster.

319
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,159
So you got bit by a great big hormone.

320
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,620
Well not by what you think.
They don't exist!

321
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:31,039
Norman, shut the fuck up!

322
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,624
Maybe he's barking at you.

323
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,667
Did I change last night?

324
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,670
Howl at the moon, kill shit
and change back this morning?

325
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:38,505
Huh? No!

326
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,965
Did it take a silver bullet
to stop that thing? No!

327
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,384
It got killed by a fucking truck.

328
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,970
You always blow off
anything you don't get.

329
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,139
Yeah, when it's bullshit!

330
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,770
You're doing drugs with guys.
Something is definitely wrong with you.

331
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,899
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I do see a monster.

332
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,277
Yeah, it's got these little green eyes.

333
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,905
Oh yeah, like I really wish
I was hemorrhaging and hairy,

334
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,323
and sucking off Jason McCardy.

335
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:09,202
- Well you always wanted to be me!
- Well this isn't you, so.

336
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,578
Oh, poor B.

337
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:14,332
I'm growing up
and obviously you're not, huh?

338
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,917
Well don't let me hold you back
or anything.

339
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,335
Oh well, don't worry, I won't.

340
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:50,410
<i>Only one creature on earth destroys
for pure pleasure.</i>

341
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,786
<i>It's a werewolf.</i>

342
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,292
<i>Oh my god, there it is.</i>

343
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,085
<i>It's hideous!</i>

344
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:21,983
Get the fuck outta the bathroom!
I'm trying to get ready!

345
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,159
<i>Ginger? Oh my god.</i>

346
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,384
<i>(whistles)
Oh babe...</i>

347
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,261
<i>Check it out.</i>

348
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,263
Not as good as that.

349
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,098
Hello, hello, hello...

350
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:43,940
Hey!

351
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,820
Kid, you got a smoke?

352
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,779
No.

353
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,283
You got a light then?

354
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,913
Oh, thank you.

355
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,707
I just spent a week
of my life looking for you.

356
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,291
You can give me a second

357
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:11,884
You dropped this - in my truck.

358
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,223
OK, we both saw it.
What the fuck was it?

359
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:21,394
- It's what you hit.
- Hmm! I know,

360
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,980
but what the fuck was it?

361
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,527
See, I flattened an animal.
Furry, all-fours, could be anything.

362
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:33,156
But here I am, thinking 'lycanthrope'.

363
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,200
That's crazy, huh?

364
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:41,122
Book me into the rubber motel,
I'm officially all fucked up, right?

365
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,750
What if you're not?

366
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:50,381
Well, that would explain
the human circumcised dick,

367
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,384
and why you were
running for your life from it.

368
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,764
I have to go. Thanks for my stuff.

369
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,769
What's your name?

370
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:58,574
- Bullshit.
- Thanks.

371
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,326
No, hey, bullshit?

372
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:04,956
What do you say?

373
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,750
Swear you won't call a freak show.

374
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,295
Yeah, I swear.

375
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:18,469
I'm changing, like right now and
full moons have nothing to do with it.

376
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,347
You're serious?

377
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:23,558
And everything I look at
goes silver bullet,

378
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:27,687
in a gun, to my head, the end.

379
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:30,356
Wow.

380
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:35,069
Let's not panic here. I mean...

381
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:41,784
...for one, that thing on the road,
my van did a pretty good job on it,

382
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:47,290
without the benefit of silver bullets.
So, let's just forget the Hollywood rules.

383
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,876
There's got to be a cure, right?

384
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:53,087
Otherwise, there would be
a hell of a lot more of them.

385
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:59,552
It's like an infection, it works
from the inside out. It's like a virus.

386
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,224
Biology, there's something
you can sink your teeth into.

387
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,018
So to speak.

388
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:12,607
You're real, your problem's real,
the solution's real.

389
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:16,944
Not bam, death by morality call.

390
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,656
Then again when I started piercing shit,
I got infections,

391
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,451
girl says try pure silver,
cleared up like that.

392
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:33,377
The ancients thought
pure metals purified their blood.

393
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:37,924
- They thought leeches did, too.
- They do.

394
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:46,390
Hey, why don't you get
your slut-bitch sister a leash?

395
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,558
What a freak.

396
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:49,435
<i>Nice bird necklace.</i>

397
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,398
Ginger, a word?

398
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,321
- Is it sorry?
- No.

399
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,785
Come on Jason, let's go.

400
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:06,911
Oh yes.

401
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,372
Ginger!

402
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,040
Ginger!

403
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:17,129
Hey. She's ovulating!

404
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,936
See you, freak.
Bye bye.

405
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:39,944
This is a very exciting,
confusing time for your sister.

406
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:44,365
Boys, her body, trying to fit in.

407
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:46,826
Maybe if she felt that she
could share more with you,

408
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,078
you'd both be a lot happier.

409
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:56,127
You know, Brigitte,
your turn's coming, too... one clay.

410
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,016
My stomach.

411
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,479
Hey, take it easy, all right?
We've got all night.

412
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:21,235
Sorry, you just taste really good.

413
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:28,409
- Just lie back and relax.
- You lie back and relax!

414
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,578
Who's the guy here?

415
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,958
Who's the guy here? Huh?
Who's the fucking guy here?

416
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,461
Don't we need protection here?

417
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,129
Stop it!

418
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,007
Wait a second!

419
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:46,010
You're fucking hilarious, cave boy.

420
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:08,616
Ginge?

421
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:11,660
What happened?

422
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,457
Did he hurt you?

423
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,213
If he hurt you, you should tell.

424
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:29,720
Oh, my god!

425
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:36,185
- Get out! Get out!
- What happened?

426
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:39,980
Something is really,
really wrong with me, B.

427
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,194
What happened?

428
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:49,073
I get this ache and...

429
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:55,913
...I thought it was for sex, but it's
to tear everything into fucking pieces.

430
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,710
Where is he?

431
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:09,093
Next door.

432
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:25,651
Oh, my god!

433
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:29,071
You killed Norman.

434
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:36,412
He barked and he barked
and he kept fucking barking, and...

435
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:41,792
I just... I just...

436
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,753
...I couldn't stop myself.

437
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:50,301
B, what am I supposed to do?

438
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,558
It wasn't at all like
I thought it would be.

439
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:05,691
There was just all this
squirming and squealing.

440
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:11,530
And than he's done,
and you're like 'Oh?'

441
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:18,287
Just probably out there
telling everyone what a freak I am.

442
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:23,417
We'll say the same thing about him.

443
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:29,632
It doesn't work like that.
I mean, he got laid.

444
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm just a lay.

445
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:36,263
He's a hero and I'm just a lay,
a freak mutant lay.

446
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,683
Did you use something?

447
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:41,685
No.

448
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:53,197
You really think this will work?

449
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,574
We have to try something.

450
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:02,039
Where did you get that, that ring?

451
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,332
I found it.

452
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:06,627
Too bad.

453
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:14,134
You should have one too.
I mean, for being with me on this.

454
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,391
Ready?

455
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,727
Yeah.

456
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,284
Shit, it's stuck!

457
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,080
Hold still.

458
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,418
- Fuck! Hurry up!
- Sorry, sorry.

459
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,212
It's almost there.

460
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,679
How do you feel?

461
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:05,394
Wicked.

462
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:14,153
Norman?

463
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,449
Here, Norman.

464
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,303
Hurry up!

465
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:44,058
- Hold still.
- I am, hurry up.

466
00:45:03,077 --> 00:45:04,370
- Oh yea.
- Oh yes.

467
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:06,121
Come on, hit it, baby.

468
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,123
- Nice.
- Alright.

469
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:19,426
- Oh, McCardy what happened to you?
- Ginger Fitzgerald rocked my world.

470
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:21,428
Whoa shit!

471
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,223
What, did you get your rag, too?

472
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:26,642
Oh, shit!

473
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,687
It must be ink, all right? Fuck!

474
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:40,739
Hi!

475
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:43,659
Brigitte!

476
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:48,205
Brigitte, come here.

477
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,959
What the fuck, B?
Did you get a boyfriend or something?

478
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,670
No, we just...

479
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,630
I'll be right back.

480
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:04,388
Oh my god.

481
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:08,308
Hey, what's up? Look, if silver's shot,
I've been reading and I got another idea.

482
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:13,063
Are you on drugs, like right now?
I'm in class here.

483
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:18,694
Yeah, excuse me for giving a shit.

484
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:23,907
- I'll come see you later, OK?
- Whatever.

485
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:33,292
The Fitzen sisters are really getting around.

486
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:40,507
- OK, line change. Lets go.
- He thinks I got bit.

487
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:44,261
I trust you, and you blab to
the first fuck-up that comes along.

488
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,847
He knows stuff, he wants to help.

489
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:50,350
He wants to get down
your pants, stupid!

490
00:46:51,477 --> 00:46:55,606
So, sluts run in the family... quel shocker!

491
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:58,317
You're fucking dead.

492
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,127
Oh yea.

493
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,171
- <i>Knock it off!</i>
- <i>Ginger, no!</i>

494
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,424
<i>Ginger, no! Stop!</i>

495
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,593
Fight, fight, fight...

496
00:47:28,806 --> 00:47:32,726
- You started it.
- Ginger, to the office.

497
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:42,861
<i>This school has a
'zero tolerance for violence' policy.</i>

498
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,279
<i>I mean a temper like that
is inexcusable</i>

499
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:47,533
<i>barring substantial
extenuating circumstances.</i>

500
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:22,484
What are you looking at? Huh?
My pen exploded, OK. My red pen.

501
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,945
That was fucking incredible.

502
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:26,154
Get your camera,
don't you have your camera?

503
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,948
This is wall-worthy.
Come on.

504
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,950
You gave it to Jason.

505
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:34,705
You had unprotected sex,
and you infected him.

506
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:36,665
OOPS!

507
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:45,048
- I have to see Sam. He's got an idea.
- I'll bet he does. Well, let's go.

508
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:48,594
If you come, you can't be weird, Ginger.

509
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:51,638
If he gets I lied. If he gets that
you're really the one who's really...

510
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:55,100
a what? ...a monster? Huh, a freak?

511
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:59,062
If he thinks I dicked him around,
he'll blow this off.

512
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,816
I'll behave.

513
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:10,949
Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

514
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,662
- <i>Hey.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

515
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:20,250
Sorry about before. I was just afraid
someone would hear us, that's all.

516
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:23,754
Yeah, she is just a little moody lately.

517
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:26,965
That whole silver thing
didn't quite work out, did it?

518
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:30,719
I wasn't expecting company.

519
00:49:30,928 --> 00:49:33,972
My sister, Ginger. She knows.

520
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:39,519
If you two come in here,
you see sweet fuck all. Understood?

521
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,861
Jesus!

522
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,407
Wicked! Smoke us up!

523
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:55,160
Yeah, wicked huh?
Get the fuck out!

524
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:00,415
All right, Brigitte,
it breaks down like this.

525
00:50:00,624 --> 00:50:04,086
I compared homeopathic
treatments of infections

526
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:06,171
to the folklore of all this.
Take a look.

527
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,049
Aconitum di lycoctonum.

528
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:11,718
- 'Lyco' as in wolf?
- Right.

529
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:12,970
It's called Monkshood.

530
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,556
It's a cousin of wolfsbane,
except this stuff is safe in small doses.

531
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:20,102
It's a super oxidant breed, radical detox.

532
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,688
It promotes white blood cell growth.

533
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:25,273
Which fight infection.
Do you have some?

534
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:27,067
Well, it's perennial.

535
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,444
It grows everywhere,
but only in the spring.

536
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:32,489
Fuck! This is bullshit, OK?

537
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,870
- I seeded some, I'm growing it.
- She doesn't have time for that.

538
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:42,791
She's killed a dog already.
She's fucked.

539
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,501
She's growing a tail.
Did you tell him that?

540
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,711
Ginger!

541
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:49,172
You're growing a tail?

542
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:50,841
Yes.

543
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,347
Look, he's just another wank job. OK?

544
00:50:57,556 --> 00:51:00,142
What the fuck do you think you are?
Give me that.

545
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,853
What the fuck are you?
Pervert, she's 15!

546
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,022
Ginger, wait outside!

547
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:14,948
Fine, if he rapes you,
don't come crying.

548
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:16,366
I'll be at home.

549
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,623
She's just freaking.

550
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,753
I do not think of you that way.

551
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:46,438
Fuck!

552
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:48,065
Fuck! Fuck!

553
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,540
Your dad's battery is dead again.
He's stranded at the supermarket.

554
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:08,085
- Wanna go for a ride?
- Jesus, can't you knock?

555
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:10,170
Don't you 'Jesus' me.

556
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:13,048
You don't have anything
I haven't seen before.

557
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:14,216
That's what you think.

558
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:15,842
What is that supposed to mean?

559
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:19,471
Nothing, I'm just, I'm fat, all right.
Get out!

560
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:22,265
Ginger, you are not fat.

561
00:52:22,474 --> 00:52:25,477
These fashion models
are all on speed to look like that.

562
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,312
Get out!

563
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,358
OK. Gosh.

564
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:33,443
I'll be back soon.

565
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,548
Give me back my dog.

566
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:59,636
- Trina, I don't have your dog.
- Ginger took him. I saw her.

567
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:05,767
You know, I feel sorry for you.
He doesn't like you.

568
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:10,814
He's a cherry-hound. He's into virgins.

569
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,109
Trina, you're bleeding. Go home.

570
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:18,280
If you are so fucking smart,
you won't give him the satisfaction.

571
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:21,950
Somebody just once shouldn't give
that fucker the satisfaction!

572
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,287
- Trina, go now.
- You are as big a cunt as your sister.

573
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:27,247
I am not.

574
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:30,876
- Hey, meat. Back for more?
- What are you doing?

575
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:35,505
I don't know, B. What am I doing?
Call Sam. Ask the pro.

576
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:36,631
What?

577
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:41,303
You play with your new friends,
and I'll play with mine.

578
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:44,514
Ginger, what the hell are you doing?

579
00:53:44,723 --> 00:53:48,560
You smell yummy. What is that?
Citrus or antiseptic? I'm not sure.

580
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,270
Are you crazy?

581
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:56,610
- OK, that's enough. Just let her go.
- Shut up. Shut up, shut up.

582
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,112
OK, let's just chill.
Right, Trina?

583
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:00,614
Uh, you know what, Trina?

584
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,241
She is doing your boy, now.
I wouldn't be so quick to get so friendly.

585
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,328
- Stop it, it's not like that.
- I think she's scared for you, love, huh?

586
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,205
She's an asshole. She's not worth it.

587
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,123
You asked for this!

588
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:14,711
You picked Sam over me.
Whatever happens now, it is your fault!

589
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:20,258
- This is not you. Just let's cope.
- Oh, with what? With this kind of shit.

590
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:22,886
He's wrong, moron.
You can't fix this!

591
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,055
You don't know that.
Just give me a chance.

592
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:27,432
What, another one?
God gee, I don't know, B...

593
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:29,059
...see I'm going way way out there...

594
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:33,146
...way way far from where you live,
which you pretty much fucking rule.

595
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:40,737
Oh god, that's disgusting,
you fucking gross, fucking...

596
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:41,821
Back!

597
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,284
Don't touch me, you freaks.
You're both just totally fucked.

598
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:48,161
Trina, we were just...

599
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,417
Uh-oh.

600
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:15,063
Get up!

601
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:21,069
Get up now!

602
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:25,073
Henry, what on earth
are you doing out there?

603
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:30,537
Come on, don't eat it until we get inside.

604
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:39,045
Jesus Christ on a bicycle! What the...?

605
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:44,634
Girls, I told you,
no more deaths in the house!

606
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:47,137
Don't be mad, it's for extra credit.

607
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:50,098
Back to immaculate in ten minutes.

608
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:55,729
Corn syrup.
Dad, d'you want some?

609
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:02,193
Well I better get this meat away.

610
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,904
I'll do that.

611
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:15,623
- Mom.
- What?

612
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,422
What do guys want?

613
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:30,972
Brigitte, I'm so glad you asked.

614
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,854
And that's what men want.

615
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:44,277
Some of them might seem cool or different,
but they're all pretty much the same.

616
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:47,447
- Totally.
- Thanks for sharing.

617
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:50,158
Oh, honey, that's what we're here for.

618
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:56,873
Bed time. It's a school night.
Beauty rest.

619
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:14,307
This is just great.

620
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:19,145
Yeah, field hockey will suck now.

621
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:24,150
Get me a screwdriver.

622
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:42,585
Oh, god!

623
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,136
Way to go.

624
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:17,954
Here it is:
'Why your daughter dates dummies?'

625
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:20,832
I'm so glad I hung on to this.

626
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:26,588
- I think they're up to something.
- They're just being normal teenage girls.

627
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:31,092
Then why are they suddenly
so interested in what you have to say?

628
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:37,974
Stay in your own little world, Henry.
This one just confuses you.

629
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:48,026
Shit. Look at all the worms.

630
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:51,696
Remember when I used to
make you eat them just to get in here?

631
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:57,160
Shallow grave?
Oh well, seems appropriate.

632
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:01,789
You dig for a while.

633
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:05,877
Look,

634
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:08,546
no one ever thinks
chicks do shit like this.

635
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:13,051
Trust me, a girl can only be a slut,

636
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:17,222
a bitch, a tease, or the virgin next door.

637
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:21,559
We'll just coast on how the world works.

638
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:28,441
Think she's pretty?

639
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,238
If I wasn't here, would you eat her?

640
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:35,532
No.

641
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:42,664
- God, that'd be like, fucking her.
- You can't go out anymore.

642
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:49,087
Well I can't stay in, I'll go mental.

643
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:58,972
We'll make Pam think you're at school.

644
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,350
We'll make school think you're home sick.

645
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,979
Just till there is no doubt about us in this.

646
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:10,984
Then we blow,
as far away from here as possible.

647
01:00:25,248 --> 01:00:27,584
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

648
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:30,670
<i>Starting immediately certain students
will be paged to the office</i>

649
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:34,966
<i>to assist the police regarding
Trina Sinclair's disappearance.</i>

650
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:36,467
She is dead, man.

651
01:00:36,676 --> 01:00:39,762
<i>When your name is called,
please come to the office.</i>

652
01:00:57,989 --> 01:01:00,199
Is Ginger avoiding me?

653
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:06,164
'Cause I'm feeling pretty good right now.

654
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,083
I just got a few questions for her, like uh...

655
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:11,794
I'm growing a goddamn tail outta my ass,

656
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:16,382
and I thought she might have a few tips
on how to deal with keeping that quiet!

657
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:21,846
- Hurting me won't help.
- See? I'm up to some whack shit right now.

658
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:25,725
I'm way out on the corner of
'Fucked-Up and Evil'.

659
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:30,938
You wanna know what I did
for fun last night, huh?

660
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:35,693
I killed my own freaking dog, OK?
What am I supposed to do about that?

661
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:40,365
- You're gonna be in deep shit.
- I'm right with you on deep shit,

662
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:42,533
and I think you know why.

663
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:46,746
What's going on here?

664
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:50,875
Thanks.

665
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:06,182
- Ginger, how was school today?
- I don't know, I didn't go.

666
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:08,309
- We had a field trip.
- Really?

667
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:10,937
I didn't sign any form for a field trip.

668
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:14,023
Daddy, will you teach me
how to drive tonight?

669
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:16,192
Next year. Maybe.

670
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:18,903
So where did you go?

671
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:21,739
- What if next year never comes?
- Ginger.

672
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:23,074
Mr. Wayne called today.

673
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:26,160
He wanted to know if
you were feeling any better.

674
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:28,830
When you might be
coming back to school.

675
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:32,875
The police wanna talk to you.
Something about a fight with a missing girl?

676
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:35,920
- Daddy, may I be excused?
- No, you may not.

677
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:39,924
- Ginger, wait.
- For what, B?

678
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,427
Oh no, you don't.

679
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:50,727
I want to know what's going on.
Right now.

680
01:02:57,734 --> 01:02:59,944
- What are these?
- Monkshood. Brigitte...

681
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:04,907
- Where did you get them?
- From a craft store. Now, I want an answer.

682
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:14,083
Trina Sinclair tried to beat me up,
'cause Jason McCardy liked us better,

683
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:18,546
- so Ginger beat her up. That's all.
- That's all?

684
01:03:18,755 --> 01:03:22,133
Beating up other girls? Cutting classes?

685
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:26,471
- I'm very disappointed, Brigitte.
- Sorry.

686
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:30,892
You just do whatever she wants you to.
You always have.

687
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,103
I really wish you'd start
thinking more for yourself.

688
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:40,693
Do you think I should talk to her?

689
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:42,820
Check in?

690
01:03:43,946 --> 01:03:48,034
She thinks it's cool you let us
figure stuff out for ourselves.

691
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:48,951
Oh?

692
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:51,954
Really?

693
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:54,832
Well...

694
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,835
I wondered if that approach was working.

695
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:00,171
Look what Pamela had.

696
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:07,637
- What are you doing? Stop!
- I'll just take it off.

697
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:08,721
No!

698
01:04:09,514 --> 01:04:11,432
I killed their pets, B.

699
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:15,478
And nothing helps
except tearing live things to pieces.

700
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:17,522
I can't be like this.

701
01:04:18,356 --> 01:04:19,732
This is monkshood.

702
01:04:19,941 --> 01:04:23,778
First thing tomorrow
we find out how to use it and we take off.

703
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:30,201
If you give up now, you leave me here alone.
I would never do that to you!

704
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,665
I'm sorry. I'm scared.

705
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:03,568
<i>BCX radio wishes you a happy Halloween...</i>

706
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:35,850
B, what the fuck are you doing?

707
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:39,395
Hey... B, let me out!

708
01:05:39,604 --> 01:05:41,188
I have to deal with the cure.

709
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:43,858
This way,
you can't hurt yourself or anybody else.

710
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:50,656
Fuck. You fucking sissy little girl.
You're going rat me out?

711
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,825
Just shut up and wait for me.

712
01:05:53,034 --> 01:05:56,454
You little bitch! Fuck you!
I hate you!

713
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:02,251
B, let me out. Come on.

714
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,294
B?

715
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:05,922
B!

716
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:07,882
Let me out!

717
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:24,774
Holy shit, that's monkshood.
Where the fuck did you get that?

718
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:29,403
I don't know if you smoke it or eat it
or what, but I need to try it now.

719
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:34,200
Well, you got me but...

720
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:39,538
...to be sure, I'd have to say
direct route. Inject it.

721
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:45,461
But see, that's a bad idea Brigitte, because
neither of us know what this stuff does.

722
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,464
It can't be worse than being road kill.

723
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,885
The dosage will be a guess. I mean...

724
01:06:53,094 --> 01:06:55,179
It would have to be,
there is no way to match for...

725
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:58,182
metabolism, bodyweight,
there could be side effects.

726
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:04,939
- You cannot try this alone.
- My sister will be there.

727
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:31,275
Understand you may kill her
trying to save her.

728
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:33,360
What?

729
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:36,489
It's for Ginger, isn't it?

730
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:44,663
Look, worst-case scenario,
you put her out of her misery.

731
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:50,044
Just as long as you're prepared
for that, and I mean sure.

732
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:55,674
Try to come tonight.

733
01:09:19,657 --> 01:09:22,159
Hey, have you seen Jason?

734
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:25,663
Umm... you got a little...

735
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:27,498
You're going to
the greenhouse bash tonight?

736
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:29,375
- Erm, yeah.
- Good.

737
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:33,212
I'm in charge of the prizes.
You, too, could be a winner.

738
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:41,554
Ginger. My office.
Now. Alright?

739
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:48,144
<i>Help! Help!</i>

740
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:58,028
<i>Help! Help!</i>

741
01:09:58,571 --> 01:09:59,572
Let me go.

742
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,031
Let me go!

743
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:04,493
Let him go, McCardy.

744
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:11,709
Oh yeah, a chick. Excellent.

745
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,587
Come to papa, baby.

746
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:17,214
Come and get some candy.

747
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,918
I have to go. Uhm...

748
01:10:55,628 --> 01:10:57,671
I have a class.

749
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,721
<i>Attention please.</i>

750
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,057
<i>Brigitte Fitzgerald,
please report to guidance.</i>

751
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:09,975
<i>Brigitte Fitzerald to guidance.</i>

752
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:39,296
He wanted to call fucking Pamela,
B, and tell her we needed help.

753
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:40,756
<i>So, I stopped him.</i>

754
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:45,844
<i>You see how that works?
How I do not betray you?</i>

755
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:49,807
I didn't betray you.

756
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:57,314
You locked me up.

757
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:03,570
You need to get this fixed.

758
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:10,786
Why? So I can go to jail,
for the rest of my life?

759
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:17,376
We wait till everyone leaves,

760
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:21,714
then we clean this up, somehow.

761
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,676
I think you've fucked up enough.

762
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:39,148
<i>Oh my god!</i>

763
01:12:40,232 --> 01:12:42,901
- Henry?
- Oh g...

764
01:12:44,945 --> 01:12:46,196
What is it?

765
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:54,913
Henry, for Pete's sake.
It's for the girls' death project.

766
01:12:56,874 --> 01:12:58,834
They're fake, you big baby.

767
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,252
I'm gonna find something to clean this up.

768
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:45,839
Stay here and lock the door.

769
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:05,586
Oh my god!

770
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:25,022
Hello, Brigitte.

771
01:15:25,564 --> 01:15:27,900
- Stop it!
- Can I touch your boobies?

772
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:29,818
I like little girls.

773
01:15:30,027 --> 01:15:31,403
Leave him alone!

774
01:15:31,612 --> 01:15:32,779
Ginger. Stop! Stop!

775
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:34,323
Ginger, fucking stop!

776
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:35,782
Please stop!

777
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:41,205
Ginger, stop! He hasn't done anything!

778
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,541
I don't like how he looks at you.

779
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:57,971
Oh my god!

780
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,987
He found me. Brigitte.

781
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:18,408
- The mess. I had to...
- Go to hell!

782
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:31,964
He's not dead.
You've infected him.

783
01:16:33,549 --> 01:16:35,509
Let me call help for him.

784
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:41,265
Oh fuck!

785
01:16:42,975 --> 01:16:43,767
Fuck!

786
01:16:49,565 --> 01:16:50,691
You like it.

787
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:56,154
It feels so... good, Brigitte.

788
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:00,867
It's like touching yourself.

789
01:17:01,076 --> 01:17:05,372
You know every move...
right on the fucking dot.

790
01:17:05,581 --> 01:17:07,916
And after...

791
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:12,838
...you see fucking fireworks, supernovas.

792
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:17,217
I'm a goddamn force of nature.

793
01:17:18,594 --> 01:17:23,890
I feel like I could do
just about anything.

794
01:17:29,605 --> 01:17:33,650
You know we're almost not
even related anymore.

795
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:35,569
You're fucked!

796
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:40,365
You'd love it.
Should come for the ride.

797
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:43,619
A little scratch.
Swap some juice.

798
01:17:44,244 --> 01:17:48,123
We'll be our own pack, like before.
It's so us, B.

799
01:17:48,332 --> 01:17:51,460
I'd rather be dead than be what you are.

800
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:54,087
We have a pact!

801
01:17:54,296 --> 01:17:58,800
Out by sixteen or dead in this scene,
but together for fucking ever!

802
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:02,179
I said I would die for you!

803
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:07,893
No. You said you'd die with me.
'Cause you had nothing better to do.

804
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:12,439
Fuck you too.

805
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:17,653
You think I wanna go back to being nobody?

806
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:20,364
You're fucked!

807
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:24,368
Stay the hell out of my way, Brigitte.

808
01:18:25,661 --> 01:18:28,330
And I'll tell Sam you said hi.

809
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:14,209
Stop! Stop!

810
01:19:29,558 --> 01:19:31,935
Where's your sister?

811
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:34,479
County greenhouse.

812
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:36,064
Get in the van.

813
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:05,719
All right, Fitz. Wicked costume, baby.

814
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:24,488
Where is Sam?

815
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:33,580
Shit!

816
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:36,666
Hey.

817
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:42,798
- Hey Ginger, where is Brigitte?
- She couldn't make it.

818
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:46,343
- Yeah, why is that?
- Cramps.

819
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:49,721
She says hi.

820
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:54,893
You wanna buy or something?

821
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:56,478
Or something.

822
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:12,160
- Go get your sister.
- Mom, I don't think...

823
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,704
You've done a terrible thing.

824
01:21:15,831 --> 01:21:16,790
But...

825
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:21,545
...you're my tiny babies.

826
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:26,341
It's one thing if you leave,
it's almost normal,

827
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,718
but no one is gonna take you from me.

828
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:34,015
First thing tomorrow I'll let the house
fill up with gas, and I'll light a match.

829
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:35,141
What?

830
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:40,230
We'll start fresh.
Just us girls. It'll be fun.

831
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:43,608
What about dad?

832
01:21:44,693 --> 01:21:48,738
He'll just blame me,
they all will.

833
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:56,037
This isn't your fault, mom.

834
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:04,629
Yes it is.

835
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:10,844
Lock the doors, OK?

836
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,982
- Ginger, come on.
- No, you come on.

837
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:30,030
- What are you doing?
- I know you want to. Everybody does.

838
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:36,161
Really, what would I be like?

839
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,121
What would I do?

840
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:44,794
- What would I feel like inside?
- Ginger, stop.

841
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:48,798
- Make me.
- Ginger, your sister...

842
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:14,866
This is fucked.

843
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:19,537
Ginger, get off me.
Get off me.

844
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:20,997
Ginger, get off me!

845
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,335
Jerk!

846
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:29,464
What? I told you to stop.
Oh Jesus.

847
01:23:31,383 --> 01:23:34,094
God, Ginger get up. I'm sorry.

848
01:23:34,302 --> 01:23:35,971
Get up, Ginger.

849
01:23:39,808 --> 01:23:40,892
You bitch!

850
01:23:41,101 --> 01:23:42,560
You want me? You want me?

851
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:45,855
Stop hurting everybody else and take me.
Take me!

852
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:49,526
I don't want you!
I don't even know you!

853
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:54,614
Brigitte, don't.

854
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:02,831
Brigitte, don't!

855
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:07,419
You wrecked everything for me
that isn't about you.

856
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:11,589
No.

857
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:14,509
Shit.

858
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:18,722
Now I am you.

859
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:25,186
I know you are.
But what am I?

860
01:24:27,856 --> 01:24:29,441
We got to go.

861
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:04,976
B, I can't.
I'm turning too fast.

862
01:25:10,982 --> 01:25:15,111
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I won't let you do this, Brigitte.

863
01:25:15,487 --> 01:25:17,530
You both need help.

864
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:19,866
You fucking idiot!

865
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:21,868
The cure works.

866
01:25:22,077 --> 01:25:24,370
I had to use it on somebody else,
but there is more at the house.

867
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:27,123
This is the only way I could
get her to come back with me.

868
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:28,792
Oh shit!

869
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:32,128
What? How was I supposed to know that?

870
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:39,677
Just help me, OK?
Just get her in your truck and drive us home.

871
01:25:39,886 --> 01:25:43,014
Fine, but she rides in the back.

872
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:58,822
This is nuts, you need a doctor.

873
01:26:02,909 --> 01:26:03,618
Oh!

874
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:05,995
Jesus.

875
01:26:08,915 --> 01:26:12,210
She could have killed you, Brigitte.

876
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:14,379
She needs me.

877
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:19,509
Get home. Cure her, cure me.

878
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:21,970
And then what?

879
01:26:23,138 --> 01:26:24,097
Run.

880
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:28,810
You know you're kidding yourself.

881
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:19,944
I'll be right back. Give me the syringe.

882
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,827
Dad? Hello?

883
01:27:29,454 --> 01:27:30,330
Oh shit!

884
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:36,628
Yeah, I meant to fix that.

885
01:27:38,129 --> 01:27:42,050
- Did she get out?
- Oh god, I hope not.

886
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:44,761
I can't see anything.

887
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:49,432
Pass me that flashlight.

888
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:18,419
Fuck!

889
01:28:21,214 --> 01:28:24,175
That was your god damn sister!

890
01:28:28,388 --> 01:28:29,472
Oh fuck.

891
01:28:32,684 --> 01:28:34,852
The monkshood's in there.

892
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,523
Oh, you're out of your mind.

893
01:28:39,691 --> 01:28:41,067
Not yet.

894
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:45,446
Be quiet. I gotta get the stuff.

895
01:28:52,996 --> 01:28:53,997
Great.

896
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:23,985
Fuck! Where the fuck is she?

897
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:29,198
Shh.

898
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,388
- Let's do this fast.
- Hell, yes.

899
01:29:56,601 --> 01:29:58,853
All right, bowls.

900
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:03,066
Alcohol, alcohol.

901
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:11,699
Brigitte.

902
01:30:13,785 --> 01:30:15,119
Could I have your lighter?

903
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:18,539
I can't feel my hand.

904
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:20,625
Jesus Christ.

905
01:30:25,046 --> 01:30:25,755
Oh fuck!

906
01:30:26,089 --> 01:30:27,632
Go! Go!

907
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:39,435
- Alcohol.
- What?

908
01:30:39,644 --> 01:30:42,647
- Alcohol!
- Oh shit. Yeah.

909
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:48,486
Start grinding up the buds.

910
01:30:56,953 --> 01:30:58,913
All right, pour it in.

911
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:02,542
Easy, easy, easy"-

912
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:06,170
What was that?

913
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:12,051
Shit, keep going. Go, go.

914
01:31:13,553 --> 01:31:14,971
All right, hold this.

915
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:26,441
- Right, that's real fucking hygienic.
- I doubt it matters.

916
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:33,114
How about you take this and we blow?

917
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:35,408
How about no?

918
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:39,954
Then let me do it, you can hardly move.

919
01:31:40,163 --> 01:31:41,164
No!

920
01:31:42,415 --> 01:31:44,584
You can't do this by yourself.

921
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,463
Let me take the needle,
I'll go into the living room,

922
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:52,091
you lead her in, barn we're done.

923
01:31:57,138 --> 01:31:59,182
- OK.
- OK.

924
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:10,443
- I'm going.
- Be careful.

925
01:35:29,517 --> 01:35:30,518
Sam?

926
01:36:06,846 --> 01:36:07,972
Ginger?

927
01:37:53,494 --> 01:37:54,620
I can't.

928
01:37:56,956 --> 01:37:58,123
I won't.

929
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,002
The fuck.

930
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:06,882
Fuck!

931
01:38:54,722 --> 01:38:55,723
Fuck off!

932
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:00,436
Leave me alone!

933
01:40:37,533 --> 01:40:38,534
Ginger?

934
01:40:43,706 --> 01:40:46,166
Come on. It's me.

935
01:40:48,377 --> 01:40:49,795
OK?

936
01:40:52,339 --> 01:40:54,717
Ginger, please, it's me!

937
01:41:06,145 --> 01:41:07,688
You want this?

938
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:14,111
You want this?

939
01:41:29,334 --> 01:41:32,463
I'm not dying in this room with you!

940
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:38,677
I'm not dying!
