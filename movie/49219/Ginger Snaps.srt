1
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,897
What have you got there?

2
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:07,298
God!

3
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,857
Baxter?

4
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:15,158
Ah!

5
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:04,377
He got our dog.

6
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:09,659
He got Baxter.

7
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,622
Shut up, Norman.

8
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,058
Baxter's fertilizer.

9
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:43,580
And everyone's just
standing there like... staring.

10
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,906
Why don't they just catch that thing?

11
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:54,937
How hard could it be in
a place full of dead ends?

12
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:56,438
Fuck!

13
00:02:56,947 --> 00:02:59,462
Wrists are for girls...

14
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,900
I'm slitting my throat.

15
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,886
You should definitely hang.

16
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,587
Maybe even your final moment is
a cliché around here.

17
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:11,945
Not ours. B, ours will rock.

18
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:15,737
You don't think our deaths should be
a little more than a cheap entertainment?

19
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:19,787
You jazzed me on this.
Don't wuss out now.

20
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:24,307
It's the idea of everyone
staring at me just lying there.

21
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:29,084
I mean, what if they just... laugh?

22
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,185
They'll be in awe.

23
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:35,387
B, suicide is like
the ultimate "fuck you".

24
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:36,988
Come on it's so "us".

25
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:39,589
It's the pact.

26
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:42,548
See, it's easy for you.
You don't care.

27
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,382
We swore we'd go together,
one way or another.

28
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:48,586
When we were eight.
- So?

29
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:53,861
Out by sixteen or dead in the scene,
but together forever.

30
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,903
Together forever.

31
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:08,546
United against life as we know it.

32
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:11,447
Us dead will be the shit, B.
Trust me!

33
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,065
Too much blood...

34
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:31,108
...and I can see your gonch!
- Just do it.

35
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,946
Well that was completely...
disturbing, wasn't it?

36
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,502
You know, the Fitzgerald sisters
clearly worked very...

37
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:05,703
God!

38
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,707
I mean... I, I...

39
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,908
I am completely sickened.

40
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:14,708
Sickened... by that, wasn't I?

41
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:21,062
Look, see me in the guidance office,
after class, you two, separately.

42
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,910
Can we see the ones
with Ginger again?

43
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,911
Enough!

44
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:26,912
Hey!

45
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:32,705
'Life in Bailey Downs'.
Who's next?

46
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:46,707
Oh yes, ladies, run. Run for daddy!

47
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:49,708
Bounce.

48
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,661
I bet she's good to go.

49
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:57,262
You wanna do a Fitzgerald?
- You're kidding?

50
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,512
Not the little dweeb,
you doinks.

51
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,513
...the one with the rack!

52
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,214
The redhead.

53
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:06,707
I think McCardy just checked me.

54
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:15,025
Like you care, right?

55
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,265
High school is just
a mindless little breeders machine.

56
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,503
A total hormonal toilet.

57
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,023
I'd rather wait it all out in our room.

58
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,782
What is with your back?
- I don't know.

59
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,911
Hey, 'Search and Destroy'. Go.

60
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:39,508
Okay, Trina Sinclair.

61
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,224
Excellent selection, continue.

62
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:49,212
Trina Sinclair, D.O.A.
at the hair dye aisle.

63
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:53,113
Perished while seeking matching barrettes
on nothing but diet pills and laxatives.

64
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,502
Likes her shorts stuck up her ass crack.

65
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,303
Favorite homework excuse:
my nail glitter ate it.

66
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:04,709
Basic pleasure model.
- Your standard, cumbuckety date bait.

67
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,227
Good one.

68
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,714
Line change. Lets go, girls.
- Fucking Bitch!

69
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,015
Uh oh.

70
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:22,311
Lets do this again.

71
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,192
I'll cover you.

72
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,867
Good.

73
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,870
Bounce, babies. Bounce!
Keep running.

74
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,912
You want it baby.

75
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,013
C'mon, honey!

76
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,014
Oh yeah, baby!

77
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,309
You want it, baby.
- Fuck off!

78
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:54,852
'The Beast of Bailey Downs' strikes again.

79
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:56,953
That's four dogs this week.

80
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:59,053
Oh! Wow... Bonus!

81
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:02,388
I guess you're D.O.A. on a dog.
Huh, fish face?

82
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:04,671
That's enough.

83
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,393
Are you OK?

84
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,991
Terrific.
- That is one mother fucking mad dog.

85
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,111
Brigitte, go get cleaned up.

86
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,029
Don't ever touch my sister again.

87
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:19,504
Stop me. Freak.

88
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,109
Enough! Break it up!

89
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:42,004
Hey, that janitor is looking
right down your shirt.

90
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:43,705
Sure.

91
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,454
Want me to kill her?
I'll kill her for you, B.

92
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,155
Whatever.

93
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,946
No, not whatever.
This isn't whatever.

94
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,994
Seriously, what about torture?

95
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,874
Anything you want.

96
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:03,592
Or... she has that dog.

97
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:08,750
We could kidnap it, make it look like he
got eaten by 'The Beast of Bailey Downs'.

98
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:11,780
We got all that blood and fake guts
from the slide show.

99
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,109
Yeah, that's wicked.
Let's do it.

100
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:24,109
She screws a drug dealer;
she's begging for negative attention.

101
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:27,351
So, Sam are you... are you gonna call me?

102
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,204
Okay, you have my number, right?

103
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,206
Remember when I gave it to you, before?

104
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:33,807
Sam.

105
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:35,607
OK, bye...

106
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:37,869
Let's get up.

107
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:42,509
Such a dickhead.

108
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:43,490
See...

109
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,591
You'd let idiots get away
with fucking you up.

110
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,493
That's why the big Buddha made me...

111
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,194
...to stop them.

112
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,234
Yeah, so far you're really kicking ass.

113
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:56,035
Just give me one clean shot.
Just one, I fucking promise you.

114
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:59,314
Don't humor me!
- So, Fitz...

115
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,712
I think we should get together.

116
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:07,013
Erm...

117
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,014
No.

118
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,215
Bitch!

119
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,950
Jump, Norman. Come on.

120
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,051
B...

121
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,547
Just say you won't go average on me.

122
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,615
Just cause some gonad gets
his zipper going?

123
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,916
Rather be dead.

124
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:35,470
I'd rather die than be here without you.
- Relax, you're not, you big suck.

125
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:38,515
Ginger, don't push your sister.

126
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,318
God, I hate our gene pool.

127
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,951
Look, girls.

128
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:50,516
Come on. Let go. Let go.
You're ruining it!

129
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:01,518
Ginger, why are you rubbing your back?

130
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:05,670
It hurts.
- Why?

131
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:11,754
Well, pain flows up your nerve endings
to the synapses in your brain...

132
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,749
She is not funny.

133
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:17,308
How did you hurt it?
- Being dead.

134
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:22,070
Does it hurt down by your tail bone,
or is it up higher?

135
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:25,787
Is it tied throughout here?
- Maybe.

136
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:27,994
Does it ache back here?

137
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:31,711
Might...
- Oh my god.

138
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,474
Do you think it's cramps?

139
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:39,551
Give it a rest... for two seconds?

140
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:40,952
Pam, we're eating.

141
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:44,089
Henry, the girls are both three years
late menstruating. Okay?

142
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,998
It's not normal.
If it's finally happening...

143
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
It's not!

144
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,995
Honey, it's nothing to be scared of.
It's the most normal thing in the world.

145
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:53,128
Maybe it's cancer of the spine.
- Ginger-Ann...

146
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,529
Or tuberculosis.

147
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:58,793
See what your attitude does?
- Or spondylitis.

148
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,190
Spondo...what?
- Fuses your vertebra together.

149
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,997
Nice.
- Brigitte stop it.

150
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:05,153
Have a fit!

151
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:06,754
I've had just about enough of that tone.

152
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:10,355
That makes two of us. Fuck!
- That's it. To your room!

153
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,872
Gladly.

154
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,589
Brigitte, you're not
connected at her wrist.

155
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:22,208
Your father and I have counseling tonight.
I don't want you leaving the house.

156
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,309
The news says there's still
some wild animal on the loose.

157
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,231
They never go out.

158
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,959
Well, you're a big help.

159
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,916
As usual.

160
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:36,598
Ginger.
- What?

161
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:40,518
We'll get caught.
- No, we won't.

162
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,439
The dog won't even be out.
- He has to pee some time.

163
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,912
People don't leave
their dogs out alone anymore.

164
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:52,313
Then you will just have to distract her
while I nab the pooch and make with the gore.

165
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:56,758
I can't distract her.
- The fuck, B. This is your idea.

166
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,310
If you don't like
your ideas, stop having them.

167
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:07,219
Sorry.

168
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,220
I've just just had it
with eating all this shit, okay?

169
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,519
Check it out.

170
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,791
Now we can even leave a body.
She'll freak.

171
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,473
Oh, wicked.

172
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,830
Take his...

173
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,513
...leg?

174
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,397
He's still warm.

175
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,313
Oh, gross.

176
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:49,514
Shit!

177
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,719
Leave it then. The drag.

178
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,631
You got some on you.

179
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,318
Nice.

180
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,754
What?

181
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:07,955
B...

182
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,311
I just got the curse.

183
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,612
Eww.

184
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,994
Well, it's not contagious!

185
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,753
I know that.

186
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,054
God!

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,550
I mean, kill yourself to be different
and your own body screws you.

188
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,212
But if I start simping
around tampon dispensers...

189
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:29,513
...moaning about PMS, shoot me, OK?

190
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,713
Lets get out of here.

191
00:16:58,513 --> 00:16:59,914
Ginger?

192
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:02,915
Ginger!

193
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,916
Ginger?

194
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:10,917
Aaah!

195
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:11,918
Ginger!

196
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,319
Ginger!

197
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:43,713
Oh God. He's right behind me.

198
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:54,414
Oh, my God!

199
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:04,715
Ginger!

200
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:07,716
Ginger!

201
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,716
Ginger!

202
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,321
Get up. Come on, get up!

203
00:19:13,003 --> 00:19:14,517
Oh, fuck me!

204
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,318
Shit!

205
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:36,917
Mom!

206
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,520
Dad! Help!

207
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:43,499
Let me see.

208
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:48,000
No, it hurts, it burns...
- I got to see it Ginger.

209
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:52,317
What was it? What was it?
- I don't know. A big dog, maybe.

210
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,498
What did I do? What...

211
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:56,499
Shh.

212
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:57,921
I saw this thing once...

213
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:03,722
On bears, said a bear will like, come after
a girl on the rag because of the smell.

214
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,620
It wasn't a fucking bear!

215
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,721
There wasn't any fucking bears
anywhere near here.

216
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,315
Does that hurt?
- No.

217
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:21,636
That's impossible.
They're already healing.

218
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,701
No, this isn't right. I'm calling 911.

219
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:24,797
No! No!

220
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:27,798
B, I'm not bleeding anymore. Right?

221
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:29,944
I mean... just...

222
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,924
...spare me Pam finding out.

223
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:35,714
Okay? I'm okay. Okay?

224
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:40,115
Okay.
- I'm okay.

225
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:45,718
I thought you were gonna die.
- I'm okay.

226
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,885
Preying upon normal healthy cells...

227
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:32,756
the intruder gradually devours
the host from within...

228
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:37,158
Eventually the invader consumes
its host completely...

229
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:40,716
...and finally destroys it.

230
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:47,399
Complete meiosis involves
two successive division sequences...

231
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:52,721
...which result in four new
cells, each of which is...

232
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:07,721
This one comes with a free calendar.

233
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,640
Are you sure it's just cramps?

234
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,920
Just so you know...

235
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,321
...the words 'just' and 'cramps',
they don't go together.

236
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,522
OK, you're really girling out here.

237
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:36,523
One day, you too will know my pain.

238
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:41,044
Hey, diss me or whatever,
but I got three sisters...

239
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:44,325
...and nothing quite takes
the edge off like a good toke.

240
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:50,043
Well, maybe I like my edge, thanks.

241
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:54,318
Or maybe you're just chickened to lose it.

242
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:11,318
Just pass it, fag.

243
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,526
That a girl.
- Yeah.

244
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,724
An eighth's fifty.

245
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:37,117
I don't want any drugs.
- Then amscray.

246
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,323
I was just wondering
what you hit.

247
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:51,567
Well, officer,
it looked like a lycanthrope to me, sir.

248
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:55,726
I know what a lycanthrope is.
- Sure you do.

249
00:23:57,888 --> 00:24:00,528
Think you see werewolves a lot?

250
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:07,082
Why, do you?

251
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,202
Is it working?

252
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:17,719
No... but now I just don't care.

253
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:26,147
What the hell are you guys doing in here?

254
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:27,148
Sam, the Man.

255
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,266
Sam, man, we just needed
a place to come and smoke.

256
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,367
Hey, you know, I have an idea.

257
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:36,727
Why don't you guys get
the fuck out of my van, assholes!

258
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:40,325
No I'm serious. Get out!

259
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:46,718
Samuel, what happened to your truck?
- I tapped a tree, all right. Good bye.

260
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:48,021
Ginge, lets go.

261
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,122
Yeah, why don't you
stick to your own species Fitzenstein?

262
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,121
Trina, stick my fist.

263
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:07,927
Oh you bitch!
It's okay, baby.

264
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:17,925
Ginge, what's going on?

265
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:21,682
Something's wrong.

266
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,338
Like more than you being just...

267
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:25,639
...female.

268
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:28,920
Can you just say something please?

269
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,421
Wow!

270
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,449
'Wow'? That's it? 'Wow'?

271
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,826
I can't have a hairy chest, B.
That's fucked!

272
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,322
No way.

273
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:57,023
The fuck? What the fuck?

274
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,449
This isn't...
- What?

275
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,762
No way, like...
- What?

276
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,925
Bitten on a full moon.
Now you're hairy?

277
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,602
I know, but think about it.

278
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,724
Well thank you for taking my
total fucking nightmare so seriously!

279
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:29,025
Oh shit!

280
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,922
What if I'm dying or something?

281
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,970
We gotta see the nurse.

282
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,444
I'm sure it seems like a
lot of blood. It's a period.

283
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:48,400
But really it was like...

284
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,051
Geyser.

285
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,950
Everyone seems to panic their first time.

286
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,651
Neither of you have had
a period before and you're how old?

287
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:59,327
I'm almost 16, she just turned 15.
She skipped a grade.

288
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:04,691
A thick, syrupy, voluminous discharge
is not uncommon.

289
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:09,130
The bulk of the uterine lining
is shed within the first few days.

290
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,490
Contractions, cramps,
squeeze it out like a pump.

291
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,928
In three to five days you'll
find lighter, bright-red bleeding.

292
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:22,715
That may turn to a brownish or blackish
sludge, which signals the end of the flow.

293
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:27,524
OK, so it's all normal?
- Very!

294
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:33,085
Expect it every twenty eight days,
give or take, for the next thirty years.

295
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,566
Great. Thanks.

296
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:41,806
What about hair
that wasn't there before, and pain?

297
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:43,929
Uhuh, comes with the territory.

298
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:48,042
Thank you. Lets go, B.

299
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:53,571
Wait, you'll have to protect
against both pregnancy and STDs now...

300
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,325
Play safe!

301
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,526
Wish this where babies' legs.

302
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,484
Ginger's very favorite.

303
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:39,090
Congratulations sweetie.
You know you can ask me anything.

304
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:41,244
You're so dead.

305
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:42,527
I didn't.

306
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:45,328
Our little girl's a young woman now.

307
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:54,811
I'd never tell her anything.
- Unless you wanted to piss me off!

308
00:28:54,973 --> 00:29:00,924
I want you to be okay.
- I am! I just got my period... okay?

309
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:05,565
Now, I've got weird hairs, so what?
That means I've got hormones...

310
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:08,744
...and they may make me butt-ugly,
but they do not make me a monster.

311
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,445
So you got bit by a great big hormone.

312
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,885
Well not by what you think.
They don't exist!

313
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,086
Norman, shut the fuck up!

314
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,665
Maybe he's barking at you.

315
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:18,666
Did I change last night?

316
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:22,367
Howl at the moon, kill shit
and change back this morning? Huh? No!

317
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,671
Did it take a silver bullet
to stop that thing? No!

318
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:26,972
It got killed by a fucking truck.

319
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:31,810
You always blow off anything you don't get.
- Yeah, when it's bullshit!

320
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:36,923
You're doing drugs with guys.
Something is definitely wrong with you.

321
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,892
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I do see a monster.

322
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:44,126
Yeah, it's got these little green eyes.

323
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:47,924
Oh yeah, like I really wish I was hemorrhaging
and hairy and sucking off Jason McCarty.

324
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:51,734
Well you always wanted to be me!
- Well this isn't you, so.

325
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:56,527
Oh, poor B. I'm growing up
and obviously you're not, huh?

326
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:00,529
Well don't let me hold you back or anything.
- Oh wel,l don't worry, I won't.

327
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:33,124
Only one creature on earth destroys
for pure pleasure. It's a werewolf.

328
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,330
Oh my god, there it is.

329
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,451
He's hideous!

330
00:30:56,815 --> 00:31:01,526
Get the fuck outta the bathroom!
I'm trying to get ready!

331
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:10,327
Ginger? Oh my god.

332
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:26,828
Oh babe...

333
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:28,629
Check it out.

334
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:11,630
Hello, hello, hello...

335
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,431
Hey!

336
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:24,814
Kid, you got a smoke?

337
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:26,015
No.

338
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,535
You got a light then?

339
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,229
Oh, thank you.

340
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:37,730
I just spent a week of my life
looking for you. Give me a sec.

341
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:46,928
You dropped this in my truck.

342
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:52,031
Okay, we both saw it.
What the fuck was it?

343
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:56,032
It's what you hit.
- Hmm! I know...

344
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:58,529
...but what the fuck was it?

345
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:03,937
See, I flattened an animal.
Furry, all-fours, could be anything...

346
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:07,338
...but here I am thinking 'lycanthrope'.

347
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,251
That's crazy, huh?

348
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:14,927
Book me in to the rubber motel,
I'm officially all fucked up, right?

349
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:17,935
What if you're not?

350
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:23,846
Well, that would explain
the human circumcised dick...

351
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:26,737
...and why you were
running for your life from it.

352
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:30,929
I have to go. Thanks for my stuff.

353
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:35,731
What's your name?

354
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:29,256
Bullshit.
- Thanks.

355
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:30,932
No, hey bullshit?

356
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,609
What do you say?

357
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:38,339
Swear you won't call a freak show.

358
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,737
Yeah, I swear.

359
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,336
I'm changing, like right now and
full moons have nothing to do with it.

360
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,098
You're serious?

361
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:57,335
In everything I look I'd go silver bullet,
in a gun, to my head, the end.

362
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,336
Wow.

363
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:04,248
Let's not panic here. I mean...

364
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:10,693
...for one, that thing on the road,
my van did a pretty good job on it...

365
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,934
...without the benefit of silver bullets.
So, let's just forget the Hollywood rules.

366
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:21,139
It's got to be a cure right? Otherwise,
it would be a hell of a lot more of them.

367
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:27,729
It's like an infection, it works
from the inside out. It's like a virus.

368
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:33,179
Biology, there's something
you can sink your teeth into.

369
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,570
So to speak.

370
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:40,256
You're real, your problem's real,
the solution's real.

371
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:44,414
Not bam, death by morality call.

372
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,027
Then again when I started piercing shit,
I got infections...

373
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:50,656
girl says try pure silver...
cleared up like that.

374
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,173
The ancients thought
pure metals purified their blood.

375
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,539
They thought leeches did, too.
- They do.

376
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,739
Hey, why don't you get
your slut-bitch sister a leash?

377
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,740
What a freak...

378
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,541
...nice bird necklace.

379
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,330
Ginger, a word?

380
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,019
Is it sorry?
- No.

381
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,332
Come on Jason, let's go.

382
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:32,333
Oh yes.

383
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,634
Ginger!

384
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,100
Hey. She is ovulating!

385
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,301
- See you freak.
- Bye bye.

386
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:04,019
This is a very exciting,
confusing time for your sister.

387
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:08,255
Boys, her body, trying to fit in.

388
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:10,679
Maybe if she felt that she
could share more with you...

389
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,738
...you'd both be a lot happier.

390
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:19,540
You know, Brigitte,
your turn's coming, too... one day

391
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:33,534
My stomach.

392
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:38,060
Hey, take it easy, alright?
We've got all night.

393
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:43,619
Sorry, you just taste really good.

394
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:50,495
Just lie back and relax.
- You lie back and relax!

395
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:52,540
Who's the guy here?

396
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:57,732
Who's the guy here? Huh?
Who's the fucking guy here?

397
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,815
Don't we need protection here?

398
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:03,213
Stop it!

399
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:04,462
Wait a second!

400
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:07,342
You're fucking hilarious, cave boy.

401
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,843
Ginge?

402
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:32,541
What happened?

403
00:38:34,702 --> 00:38:36,739
Did he hurt you?

404
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:42,097
If he hurt you, you should tell.

405
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:49,598
Oh, my god!

406
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:55,497
Get out! Get out!
- What happened?

407
00:38:55,663 --> 00:38:59,134
Something is really, really wrong, B.

408
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,540
What happened?

409
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:07,855
I get this ache and...

410
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:14,372
...I thought it was for sex, but it's
to tear everything into fucking pieces.

411
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,342
Where is he?

412
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:27,537
Next door.

413
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:44,338
Oh, my god!

414
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:47,499
You killed Norman.

415
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:53,217
He barked and he barked
and he kept fucking barking, and...

416
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:58,418
I just... I just...

417
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:01,257
...I couldn't stop myself.

418
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:06,540
B, what am I supposed to do?

419
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:13,539
It wasn't at all like
I thought it would be...

420
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,301
...there was just all this
squirming and squealing...

421
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:26,936
...and than he's done,
and you're like 'Oh?'

422
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:33,344
Just probably out there telling everyone
what a freak I am.

423
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:38,702
We'll say the same thing about him.

424
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:44,975
It doesn't work like that.
I mean, he got laid.

425
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:51,540
I'm just a lay. He's a hero and
I’m just a lay, a freak mutant lay.

426
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:53,936
Did you use something?

427
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:56,437
No.

428
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,863
You really think this will work?

429
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:09,142
We have to try something.

430
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:15,305
Where did you get that... that ring?

431
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:17,343
I found it.

432
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:21,062
Too bad.

433
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:26,943
You should have one too.
I mean for being with me on this.

434
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:33,259
Ready?

435
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,160
Yeah.

436
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:50,140
Shit, it stuck!

437
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:54,980
Hold still.

438
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:58,900
Fuck! Hurry up!
- Sorry, sorry

439
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:01,746
It's almost there.

440
00:42:08,186 --> 00:42:09,700
How do you feel?

441
00:42:14,986 --> 00:42:16,500
Wicked.

442
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,901
Norman?

443
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:28,939
Hey, Norman.

444
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,640
Hurry up!

445
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,941
Hold it still.
- I am, hurry up.

446
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:14,301
Come on hit it, baby.

447
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:27,747
Oh, McCardy what happened to you?
- Ginger Fitzgerald rocked my world.

448
00:43:29,347 --> 00:43:31,737
What, did you get your rag, too?

449
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:34,638
Oh, shit!

450
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:36,945
It must be ink.
Alright? Fuck!

451
00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:48,246
Hi!

452
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,346
Brigitte!

453
00:43:53,148 --> 00:43:54,662
Brigitte, come here.

454
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,408
What the fuck, B?
Did you got a boyfriend or something?

455
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:00,908
No, we just...

456
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:02,787
I'll be right back.

457
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:10,288
Oh my god.

458
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:13,984
Hey, what's up? Look, if silver's shot,
I've been reading and I got another idea.

459
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:18,540
Are you on drugs, like right now?
I'm in class here.

460
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:23,942
Yeah, excuse me for giving a shit.

461
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:28,946
I'll come see you later, okay?
- Whatever.

462
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:37,948
The Fitzen sister are really getting around.

463
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:44,898
Okay, line change. Lets go.
- He thinks I got bit.

464
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:48,505
I trust you, and you blabbed to 
the first fuck-up who comes along.

465
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,940
He knows stuff, he wants to help.

466
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:54,307
He wants to get down
your pants, stupid!

467
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:59,343
So, sluts run in the family... quel shocker!

468
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:21,548
Get off!

469
00:45:21,548 --> 00:45:22,549
Ginger, no!

470
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,150
Ginger, no! Stop!

471
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,151
Fight, fight, fight...

472
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,940
You started it.
- Ginger, to the office.

473
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,745
This school has a
zero tolerance for violence policy...

474
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,043
...I mean a temper like that
is inexcusable...

475
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,141
...barring substantial
extenuating circumstances.

476
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,662
What are you looking at? Huh?
My pen exploded, okay. My red pen.

477
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,233
That was fucking incredible.
Get your camera, don't you have a camera?

478
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:27,520
This is wall-worthy.
Come on.

479
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,666
You gave it to Jason.

480
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:34,341
You had unprotected sex
and you infected him.

481
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,242
Oops!

482
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:44,309
I have to see Sam. He's got an idea.
- I bet he does. Well, let's go.

483
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:48,091
If you come, you can't be weird Ginger.

484
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:50,631
If he gets I lied. If he gets that
you're really the one who's really...

485
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:54,023
a what? ...a monster? Huh, a freak?

486
00:46:54,023 --> 00:46:57,741
If he thinks I dicked him around,
he'll blow this off.

487
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:01,344
I'll behave.

488
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:09,142
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

489
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,066
Sorry about before. I was just afraid
someone would hear us, that's all.

490
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:21,467
Yeah, she is just a little moody lately.

491
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:24,502
That whole silver thing
didn't quite work out, did it?

492
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:28,110
I wasn't expecting company.

493
00:47:28,271 --> 00:47:31,230
My sister, Ginger. She knows.

494
00:47:32,271 --> 00:47:36,550
If you two come in here,
you see sweet fuck all. Understood?

495
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,551
Jesus!

496
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:48,903
Wicked! Smoke us up!

497
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:51,541
Yeah, wicked huh?
Get the fuck out!

498
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:54,952
Alright, Brigitte...

499
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,512
...braced down like this.

500
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:59,392
I compared homeopathic treatments...

501
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:02,111
...of infections to the
folklore of all this. Take a look.

502
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:05,106
Aconitum di lycotonum.

503
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:07,423
'Lyco' as in wolf?
- Right.

504
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:08,730
It's called Monkshood.

505
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:12,131
 It's a cousin of wolfsbane,
except this stuff is safe in small doses.

506
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:15,469
It's a super oxidant breed, radical detox.

507
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:18,032
It promotes white blood cell growth.

508
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:20,433
Which fight infection.
Do you have some?

509
00:48:20,992 --> 00:48:24,349
Well, it's perennial. It grows
everywhere, but only in the spring.

510
00:48:24,512 --> 00:48:27,346
Fuck! This is bullshit, okay?

511
00:48:30,152 --> 00:48:33,543
I seeded some, I'm growing it.
- She does not have time for that.

512
00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:37,228
She's killed a dog already.
She's fucked.

513
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:38,972
She's growing a tail.
Did you tell him that?

514
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,351
Ginger!

515
00:48:41,312 --> 00:48:43,349
You're growing a tail?

516
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:45,350
Yes.

517
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:51,269
Look, he's just another wank job. Okay?

518
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,864
- What the fuck do you think you are?
Give me that.

519
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:56,550
What the fuck are you?
Pervert, she's 15!

520
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:58,551
Ginger, wait outside!

521
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:09,945
Fine, if he rapes you,
don't come crying. I'll be at home.

522
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:16,743
She's just freaking.

523
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:20,354
I do not think of you that way.

524
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:57,034
Your dad's battery is dead again.
He's stranded at the supermarket.

525
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,034
Wanna go for a ride?
- Jesus can't you knock?

526
00:49:59,234 --> 00:50:01,035
Don't you 'Jesus' me.

527
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:03,894
You don't have anything
I haven't seen before.

528
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:04,985
That's what you think.

529
00:50:04,994 --> 00:50:06,547
What is that supposed to mean?

530
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,948
Nothing, I'm just, I'm fat, alright.
Get out!

531
00:50:10,714 --> 00:50:12,714
Ginger, you are not fat.

532
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,720
These fashion models
are all on speed to look like that.

533
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:17,467
Get out!

534
00:50:19,192 --> 00:50:21,368
OK. Gosh.

535
00:50:21,874 --> 00:50:23,547
I'll be back soon.

536
00:50:41,274 --> 00:50:44,108
Give me back my dog.

537
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:48,474
Trina, I don't have your dog.
- Ginger took him. I saw her.

538
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:54,351
You know, I feel sorry for you.
He doesn't like you.

539
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:59,191
He's a cherry-hound. He's into virgins.

540
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:02,352
Trina, you're bleeding. Go home.

541
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:06,350
If you are so fucking smart,
you won't give him the satisfaction.

542
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:09,872
Somebody just once shouldn't give
that fucker the satisfaction!

543
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:13,233
Trina, go now.
- You are as big a cunt as your sister.

544
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:14,909
I am not.

545
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:18,432
Hey, meat. Back for more?
- What are you doing?

546
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:22,966
I don't know, B. What am I doing?
Call Sam. Ask the Pro.

547
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:24,467
What?

548
00:51:24,635 --> 00:51:28,424
You play with your new friends,
and I'll play with mine.

549
00:51:28,595 --> 00:51:31,508
Ginger, what the hell are you doing?

550
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:35,385
You smell yummy. What is that?
Citrus or antiseptic? I'm not sure.

551
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:37,353
Are you crazy?

552
00:51:38,915 --> 00:51:43,114
Okay, that's enough. Just let her go.
- Shut up.

553
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:46,189
Okay, lets just chill.
Right Trina?

554
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,056
You know what, Trina?

555
00:51:47,057 --> 00:51:49,547
 She is doing your boy, now.
I wouldn't be so quick to get so friendly.

556
00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:52,435
Stop it, it's not like that.
- I think she's scared for you, love, huh?

557
00:51:52,596 --> 00:51:54,315
She is an asshole. She's not worth it.

558
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:56,033
You asked for this!

559
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,475
You picked Sam over me.
Whatever happens now, it is your fault!

560
00:52:00,636 --> 00:52:05,791
This is not you. Just lets cope...
- Oh, with what? With this kind of shit.

561
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,312
He's wrong, moron.
You can't fix this!

562
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:10,476
You don't know that.
Just give me a chance.

563
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:12,747
What, another one?
God gee, I don't know, B...

564
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:14,253
...see I'm going way way out there...

565
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:18,150
...way way far from where you live,
which you pretty much fucking rule.

566
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:25,428
Oh god, that's disgusting,
you fucking gross, fucking...

567
00:52:25,596 --> 00:52:30,751
Back, don't touch me you freaks.
You're both just totally fucked.

568
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:32,555
Trina, we were just...

569
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:38,556
Oh. Oh.

570
00:52:56,997 --> 00:52:58,351
Get up.

571
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,111
Get up. Now.

572
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:07,951
Henry, what on earth
are you doing out there?

573
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:13,152
Come on, don't eat it until we get inside.

574
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:21,350
Jesus Christ on a bicycle! What the...?

575
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,817
Girls, I told you,
no more deaths in the house!

576
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:29,118
Don't be mad, it's for extra credit.

577
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:31,946
Back to immaculate in ten minutes.

578
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:37,357
Corn syrup, daddy want some?

579
00:53:40,877 --> 00:53:43,551
Well I better get this meat away.

580
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:46,152
I'll do that.

581
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,389
Mom.
- What?

582
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:02,955
What do guys want?

583
00:54:07,238 --> 00:54:11,152
Brigitte, I'm so glad you asked.

584
00:54:15,278 --> 00:54:17,747
And that's what men want.

585
00:54:19,638 --> 00:54:23,917
Some of them might seem cool or different
but they're all pretty much the same.

586
00:54:24,078 --> 00:54:26,957
Totally.
- Thanks for sharing.

587
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:29,553
Oh, honey, that's what we're here for.

588
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:35,954
Bed time. It's a school night.
Beauty rest.

589
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,317
This is just great.

590
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:57,359
Yeah, field hockey will suck now.

591
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:02,149
Get me a screwdriver.

592
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,350
Oh, god!

593
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,358
Way to go.

594
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,460
Here it is:
'Why your daughter dates dummies?'

595
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,461
I'm so glad I hung on to this.

596
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,031
I think they're up to something.
- They're just being normal teenage girls.

597
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,357
Then why are they suddenly
so interested in what you have to say?

598
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,952
Stay in your own little world, Henry.
This one just confuses you.

599
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,599
Shit. Look at all the worms.

600
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,117
Remember when I used to
make you eat them just to get in here?

601
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,359
Shallow grave?
... oh well, seems appropriate.

602
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,757
You dig for a while.

603
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,719
Look...

604
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,339
No one ever thinks chicks do shit like this.

605
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,597
Trust me, a girl can only be a slut...

606
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:50,596
...a bitch, a tease, or the virgin next door.

607
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,759
We'll just coast on how the world works.

608
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,360
Think she's pretty?

609
00:57:03,481 --> 00:57:05,950
If I wasn't here, would you eat her?

610
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,151
No.

611
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:14,961
God, that'd be like, fucking her.
- You can't go out anymore.

612
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,158
Well I can't stay in, I'll go mental.

613
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,638
We'll make Pam think you're at school.

614
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:33,874
We'll make school think you're home sick.

615
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:37,352
Just till there is no doubt about us in this.

616
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:42,152
Then we blow,
as far away from here as possible.

617
00:57:55,762 --> 00:57:58,072
Your attention, Please.

618
00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:01,101
Starting immediately certain students
will be paged to the office...

619
00:58:01,101 --> 00:58:05,160
...to assist the police regarding
Trina Sinclair's disappearance.

620
00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:06,641
She is dead, man.

621
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:09,760
When your name is called,
please come to the office.

622
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:29,353
Is Ginger avoiding me?

623
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:35,042
...cause I'm feel pretty good right now.

624
00:58:35,202 --> 00:58:37,876
I just got a few questions for her, like uh...

625
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:40,562
I'm growing a goddamn tail outta my ass...

626
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:44,881
...and I thought she might have a few tips
on how to deal with keeping that quiet!

627
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:50,118
Hurting me won't help.
- See? I'm up to some whack shit right now.

628
00:58:50,283 --> 00:58:53,833
I'm way out on the corner of
'Fucked-Up and Evil'.

629
00:58:54,883 --> 00:58:58,843
You wanna know what I did
for fun last night, huh?

630
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:03,395
I killed my own freaking dog, OK?
What am I supposed to do about that?

631
00:59:03,563 --> 00:59:07,876
You're gonna be in deep shit.
- I'm right with you on deep shit...

632
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:09,955
...and I think you know why.

633
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:13,954
What's going on here?

634
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,155
Thanks.

635
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:32,638
Ginger, how was school today?
- I don't know, I didn't go.

636
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,695
We had a field trip.
- Really?

637
00:59:34,795 --> 00:59:37,196
I didn't sign any form for a field trip.

638
00:59:38,443 --> 00:59:40,243
Daddy, will you teach me
how to drive tonight?

639
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:42,244
Next year. Maybe.

640
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:44,922
So where did you go?

641
00:59:44,922 --> 00:59:47,560
What if next year never comes?
- Ginger.

642
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:48,924
Mr. Wayne called today.

643
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:51,825
He wanted to know if
you were feeling any better.

644
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:54,324
When you might be
coming back to school.

645
00:59:54,484 --> 00:59:58,239
The police wanna talk to you.
Something about a fight with a missing girl?

646
00:59:58,404 --> 01:00:01,158
Daddy, may I be excused?
- No, you may not.

647
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:05,003
Ginger, wait.
- For what, B?

648
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:07,603
Oh no, you don't.

649
01:00:12,564 --> 01:00:15,363
I want to know what's going on.
Right now.

650
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:24,195
What are these?
- Monkshood. Brigitte...

651
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:28,961
Where did you get them?
- From a craft store. Now, I want an answer.

652
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:37,763
Trina Sinclair tried to beat me up,
cause Jason McCardy liked us better...

653
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:42,043
...so Ginger beat her up. That's all.
- That's all?

654
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:45,481
Beating up other girls? Cutting classes?

655
01:00:46,525 --> 01:00:49,643
I'm very disappointed, Brigitte.
- Sorry.

656
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:53,879
You just do whatever she wants you to.
You always have.

657
01:00:54,045 --> 01:00:56,958
I really wish you'd start
thinking more for yourself.

658
01:01:00,205 --> 01:01:03,266
Do you think I should talk to her?

659
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,326
Check in?

660
01:01:06,365 --> 01:01:10,405
She thinks it's cool you let us
figure stuff out for ourselves.

661
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:11,406
Oh?

662
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:14,559
Really?

663
01:01:17,565 --> 01:01:19,716
I wondered if that approach was working.

664
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,956
Look what Pamela had.

665
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:29,163
What are you doing? Stop!
- I'll just take it off.

666
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:30,164
No!

667
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:36,836
I killed their pets, B. And nothing helps
except tearing live things to pieces.

668
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:39,201
I can't be like this.

669
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:44,565
This is monkshood. First thing tomorrow
we find out how to use it and we take off.

670
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:50,765
If you give up now, you leave me here
alone. I would never do that to you!

671
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,959
I'm sorry. I'm scared.

672
01:02:19,759 --> 01:02:22,760
BCX radio wishes you a happy Halloween...

673
01:02:49,707 --> 01:02:54,081
B, what the fuck are you doing?

674
01:02:54,247 --> 01:02:57,125
Hey... B, let me out!

675
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:01,520
I have to deal with the cure. This way,
you can't hurt yourself or anybody else.

676
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:07,957
Fuck. You fucking sissy little girl.
You're going let me out?

677
01:03:08,127 --> 01:03:10,005
Just shut up and wait for me.

678
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,966
You little bitch! Fuck you!
I hate you!

679
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:19,043
B, let me out. Come on.

680
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:20,044
B?

681
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:22,545
B!

682
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:24,441
Let me out!

683
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:40,643
Holly shit, that's monkshood.
Where the fuck did you get that?

684
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:45,067
I don't know if you smoke it or eat it
or what, but I need to try it now.

685
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,677
Well, you got me but...

686
01:03:49,848 --> 01:03:54,764
...to be sure, I'd have to say
direct route. Inject it.

687
01:03:55,808 --> 01:04:00,519
But see, that's a bad idea Brigitte, because
neither of us know what this stuff does.

688
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:03,362
It can't be worse than being road kill.

689
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,603
The dosage will be a guess. I mean...

690
01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:09,865
It would have to be,
there is no way to match for...

691
01:04:09,866 --> 01:04:12,666
metabolism, bodyweight,
there could be side effects.

692
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:19,161
You can not try this alone.
- My sister will be there.

693
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:41,965
Understand you may kill her
trying to save her.

694
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:44,966
What?

695
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:46,961
It's for Ginger, isn't it?

696
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:54,761
Look, worst-case scenario,
you put her out of her misery.

697
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,961
Just as long as you're prepared
for that, and I mean sure.

698
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,366
Try to come tonight.

699
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,765
Hey, have you seen Jason?

700
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:34,086
Umm... you got a little...

701
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,963
You're going to
the greenhouse bash tonight?

702
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:37,664
Erm, yeah.
- Good.

703
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:41,362
I'm in charge of the prizes.
You, too, could be winner.

704
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,368
Ginger. My office. Now.

705
01:06:54,368 --> 01:06:55,669
Help! Help!

706
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:05,170
Help! Help!

707
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,065
Let me go.

708
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:11,367
Let him go, McCardy.

709
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:18,286
Oh yeah, a chick. Excellent.

710
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,527
Come to papa, baby.

711
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:23,569
Come and get some candy.

712
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:58,771
I have to go.

713
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:02,364
I have a class.

714
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:10,265
Attention please...

715
01:08:10,364 --> 01:08:12,565
...Brigitte Fitzgerald,
please report to guidance...

716
01:08:12,665 --> 01:08:14,366
...Brigitte Fitzerald to guidance.

717
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:42,286
He wanted to call fucking Pamela,
B, and tell her we needed help.

718
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,673
So, I stopped him.

719
01:08:44,174 --> 01:08:48,374
 You see how that works?
How I do not betray you?

720
01:08:50,413 --> 01:08:52,370
I didn't betray you.

721
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:59,573
You locked me up.

722
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,574
You need to get this fixed.

723
01:09:06,693 --> 01:09:12,485
Why? So I can go to jail,
for the rest of my life?

724
01:09:15,813 --> 01:09:18,806
We wait till everyone leaves.

725
01:09:18,973 --> 01:09:22,967
...then we clean this up, somehow.

726
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:26,768
I think you've fucked up enough.

727
01:09:37,468 --> 01:09:39,669
Oh my god!

728
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:43,270
Henry?
- Oh god...

729
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:46,727
What is it?

730
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:54,764
Henry, for Pete's sake.
It's only the girl's death project.

731
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:58,566
They're fake, you big baby.

732
01:10:37,294 --> 01:10:40,367
I'm gonna find something to clean this up.

733
01:10:40,534 --> 01:10:43,652
Stay here and lock the door.

734
01:11:58,652 --> 01:11:59,953
Oh my god!

735
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:18,754
Hello, Brigitte.

736
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:21,616
Stop it!
- Can I touch your boobies?

737
01:12:21,616 --> 01:12:23,375
I like little girls.

738
01:12:23,536 --> 01:12:24,973
Leave him alone!

739
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:26,574
Ginger. Stop! Stop!

740
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:27,675
Ginger, fucking stop!

741
01:12:28,075 --> 01:12:29,076
Please stop!

742
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:34,768
Ginger stop! He hasn't done anything!

743
01:12:34,936 --> 01:12:37,770
I don't like how he looks at you.

744
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,771
Oh my god!

745
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:05,728
He found me. Brigitte...

746
01:13:06,777 --> 01:13:09,975
...the mess I had to...
- Go to hell.

747
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:22,972
He's not dead, and you've infected him.

748
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,369
Let me call help for him.

749
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,570
Oh fuck!

750
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,771
Fuck!

751
01:13:39,817 --> 01:13:41,729
You like it.

752
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:46,152
It feels so... good, Brigitte.

753
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:50,688
It's like touching yourself.

754
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:54,977
You know every move...
right on the fucking dot.

755
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:57,448
And after...

756
01:13:57,618 --> 01:14:02,170
...you see fucking fireworks, supernovas.

757
01:14:04,018 --> 01:14:06,374
I'm a goddamn force of nature.

758
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:12,779
I feel like I could do
just about anything.

759
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:22,128
You know we're almost not
even related anymore.

760
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:24,369
You're fucked!

761
01:14:26,178 --> 01:14:32,095
You'd love it. Should come for the ride.
A little scratch. Swap some juice.

762
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:36,047
We'll be our own pack, like before.
It's so 'us', B.

763
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:39,211
I'd rather be dead than be what you are.

764
01:14:40,258 --> 01:14:41,757
We have a pact!

765
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:46,255
Out by sixteen or dead in the scene,
but together for fucking ever!

766
01:14:47,298 --> 01:14:49,495
I said I would die for you!

767
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:54,973
No. You said you'd die with me.
Cause you had nothing better to do.

768
01:14:57,979 --> 01:14:59,333
Fuck you too.

769
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:04,339
You think I wanna go back to being nobody?

770
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:06,938
You're fucked!

771
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:10,778
Stay the hell out of my way, Brigitte.

772
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:14,574
And I'll tell Sam you said hi.

773
01:15:56,474 --> 01:15:58,575
Stop! Stop!

774
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,570
Where is your sister?

775
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,016
County greenhouse.

776
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,534
Get in the van.

777
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,977
All right, Fitz. Wicked costume, baby.

778
01:17:04,741 --> 01:17:06,255
Where is Sam?

779
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:14,856
Shit!

780
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:18,657
Hey.

781
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:23,532
Hey Ginger, where is Brigitte?
- She couldn't make it.

782
01:17:24,581 --> 01:17:26,937
Yeah, why is that?
- Cramps.

783
01:17:28,501 --> 01:17:30,174
She says Hi.

784
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:35,372
You wanna buy or something?

785
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:37,021
Or something.

786
01:17:48,942 --> 01:17:51,696
Go get your sister.
- Mom, I don't think...

787
01:17:51,862 --> 01:17:54,536
You've done a terrible thing.

788
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:56,637
But...

789
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:01,382
...you're my tiny babies.

790
01:18:02,462 --> 01:18:05,276
It's one thing if you leave,
it's almost normal...

791
01:18:05,177 --> 01:18:07,577
but no one is gonna take you from me.

792
01:18:09,182 --> 01:18:12,703
First thing tomorrow I'll let the house
fill up with gas, and light a match.

793
01:18:12,703 --> 01:18:14,404
What?

794
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:18,581
We start fresh.
Just us girls. It'll be fun.

795
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:21,856
What about dad?

796
01:18:22,942 --> 01:18:26,777
He'll just blame me,
they all will.

797
01:18:31,382 --> 01:18:33,772
This isn't your fault, mom.

798
01:18:40,902 --> 01:18:42,416
Yes it is.

799
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,975
Lock the doors, okay?

800
01:18:57,383 --> 01:19:00,979
Ginger, come on.
- No, you come on.

801
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:06,376
What are you doing?
- I know you want too. Everybody does.

802
01:19:08,023 --> 01:19:12,222
Really, what would I be like?

803
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,102
What would I do?

804
01:19:15,143 --> 01:19:20,901
What would I feel like inside?
- Ginger, stop.

805
01:19:21,063 --> 01:19:24,374
Make me.
- Ginger, your sister...

806
01:19:48,174 --> 01:19:49,375
This is fucked!

807
01:19:50,904 --> 01:19:55,535
Ginger, get off me.
Get off me.

808
01:19:58,344 --> 01:19:59,983
Jerk!

809
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:03,358
What? I told you to stop.
Oh Jesus.

810
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:07,863
God, Ginger get up. I'm sorry.

811
01:20:07,863 --> 01:20:09,581
Get up, Ginger.

812
01:20:13,224 --> 01:20:18,982
You bitch. You want me? You want me?
Stop hurting everybody else and take me!

813
01:20:19,144 --> 01:20:22,581
I don't want you! I don't even know you!

814
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:27,982
Brigitte, don't.

815
01:20:33,944 --> 01:20:35,344
Brigitte, don't!

816
01:20:36,384 --> 01:20:39,775
You wrecked everything for me
that isn't about you.

817
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:46,776
No. Shit.

818
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,584
Now I am you.

819
01:20:53,345 --> 01:20:56,782
I know you are. But what am I?

820
01:20:59,425 --> 01:21:01,382
We got to go.

821
01:21:32,145 --> 01:21:35,377
B, I can't.
I'm turning too fast.

822
01:21:40,665 --> 01:21:44,682
What the hell did you do that for?
- I won't let you do this, Brigitte.

823
01:21:44,882 --> 01:21:47,299
You both need help.

824
01:21:47,465 --> 01:21:49,935
You fucking idiot.

825
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:53,543
The cure works. I had to use it on somebody
else, but there is more at the house.

826
01:21:53,706 --> 01:21:56,283
This is the only way I could
get her to come back with me.

827
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:57,984
Oh shit!

828
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:00,982
What? How was I supposed to know that?

829
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:08,301
Just help me. OK?
Just get her in your truck and drive us home.

830
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:11,459
Fine, but she rides in the back.

831
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:26,581
This is nuts, you need a doctor.

832
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:31,882
Oh!

833
01:22:32,382 --> 01:22:33,482
Jesus.

834
01:22:36,226 --> 01:22:39,537
She could have killed you Brigitte.

835
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:42,505
She needs me.

836
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,455
Get home. Cure her, cure me.

837
01:22:47,506 --> 01:22:49,703
And then what?

838
01:22:49,867 --> 01:22:51,347
Run.

839
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:55,377
You know you're kidding yourself.

840
01:23:40,947 --> 01:23:44,384
I'll be right back. Give me the syringe.

841
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,962
Dad? Hello?

842
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:54,963
Oh shit!

843
01:23:58,108 --> 01:24:00,384
Yeah, I've meant to fix that.

844
01:24:01,988 --> 01:24:05,584
Did she get out?
- Oh god, I hope not.

845
01:24:06,628 --> 01:24:08,585
I can't see anything.

846
01:24:11,148 --> 01:24:12,980
Pass me that flashlight.

847
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,881
Fuck!

848
01:24:43,128 --> 01:24:45,989
That was your god damn sister!

849
01:24:49,989 --> 01:24:51,090
Oh fuck!

850
01:24:54,109 --> 01:24:56,260
The monkshood is in there.

851
01:24:57,309 --> 01:24:59,778
Oh, you're out of your mind.

852
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,183
Not yet.

853
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:06,984
Be quiet. I gotta get this stuff.

854
01:25:13,584 --> 01:25:14,585
Great.

855
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:43,978
Fuck! Where the fuck is she?

856
01:25:47,378 --> 01:25:48,379
Shh.

857
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:10,985
Let's do this fast.
- Hell, yes.

858
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:17,589
Alright, bowls.

859
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:20,823
Alcohol.

860
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:29,124
Brigitte...

861
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:35,589
...could I have your lighter?
- I can't feel my hand.

862
01:26:36,589 --> 01:26:37,590
Jesus Christ.

863
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,591
Oh fuck!

864
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:44,384
Go! Go!

865
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:57,189
Alcohol.
- What?

866
01:26:57,389 --> 01:26:58,790
Oh shit. Yeah.

867
01:27:02,711 --> 01:27:04,782
Start grinding up the buds.

868
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,384
Alright, pour it in.

869
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:17,863
Easy, easy, easy...

870
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:21,345
What was that?

871
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,986
Shit, keep going. Go, go...

872
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:30,105
Alright, hold this.

873
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:40,787
Right, that's real fucking hygienic.
- I doubt it matters.

874
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:47,206
How about you take this and we blow?

875
01:27:47,306 --> 01:27:49,381
How about No?

876
01:27:51,872 --> 01:27:53,824
Then let me do it, you can hardly move.

877
01:27:53,824 --> 01:27:54,925
No!

878
01:27:56,072 --> 01:27:58,189
You can't do this by yourself.

879
01:27:59,432 --> 01:28:02,008
Let me take the needle,
I'll go into the living room...

880
01:28:02,008 --> 01:28:05,383
...you lead her in, bam we're done.

881
01:28:10,383 --> 01:28:11,984
Okay.

882
01:28:20,352 --> 01:28:22,992
I'm going.
- Be careful.

883
01:31:33,892 --> 01:31:35,393
Sam?

884
01:32:09,693 --> 01:32:11,294
Ginger?

885
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,472
I can't.

886
01:33:55,318 --> 01:33:56,832
I won't.

887
01:33:58,732 --> 01:34:00,833
Fuck!

888
01:34:50,678 --> 01:34:52,193
Fuck off!

889
01:34:54,959 --> 01:34:56,473
Leave me alone!

890
01:36:28,873 --> 01:36:30,874
Ginger?

891
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,596
Come on. It's me.

892
01:36:39,696 --> 01:36:41,097
Okay?

893
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,790
Ginger, please, it's me!

894
01:36:56,721 --> 01:36:58,235
You want this?

895
01:37:02,881 --> 01:37:04,395
You want this?

896
01:37:18,961 --> 01:37:21,999
I'm not dying in this room with you!

897
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:27,955
I'm not dying!

898
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:57,480
