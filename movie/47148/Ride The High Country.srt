00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,790
Come on, kids, out of the street.
Come on, kids, get back there.

2
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,765
Hey, you. Get out of there!

3
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,191
Get out of the street!

4
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,126
Get out of the street!
Clear the street!

5
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,459
Get away from there!

6
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,402
Watch out! Get out of the way.
Can't you hear?

7
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,232
Can't you see you're in the way?
Get out of here!

8
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,068
- All right.
- Out of the way!

9
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,465
Watch out, old-timer.

10
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,517
You got a good horse, but not good enough.
I'll have that dollar.

11
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,086
I'm beginning to figure
these races smell bad.

12
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,519
That thing never loses.

13
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,956
- You had your chance.
- Well, let's just say I'm a poor loser.

14
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,652
So if you want this dollar...

15
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,287
...well, you just come right on over here
and get it, sonny boy.

16
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,095
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

17
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,700
Step right up and try your luck.
Everybody welcome.

18
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,926
See the Oregon Kid in person.

19
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,266
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

20
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,102
Step right up and outshoot
the famous Oregon Kid.

21
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,540
The last of the Western town-tamers.

22
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:10,308
Fatten your wallets and be a hero
to your family. Everybody welcome.

23
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:15,045
Step up. Try your luck. All you gotta do
is hit the plates, and you win the money.

24
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,555
- Quit the sermon and turn her loose.
- One dollar on the yellow.

25
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,932
Shooting against you is like
sneaking licorice from a baby girl.

26
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,838
Care to try again?

27
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,089
Mister, could I make a 10-cent bet?

28
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,594
A whole dime? You're a plunger, sir.

29
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:03,600
Well, you see, I ain't so altogether sure I
could hit a moving target without buckshot.

30
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,102
I used to be fair with a scattergun...

31
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:10,140
...but then that was when the bird
wasn't too far away or flying too fast.

32
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,677
Them plates, I just don't see
how you manage.

33
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,241
Well, I'll be damned.

34
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,544
- How are you, Gil?
- No great complaints.

35
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,085
How long has it been?
Lordy, I'd hate to say.

36
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,745
Quite some time.

37
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,754
Where you been all these years?

38
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,952
Here and there.
Quite a little enterprise you've got.

39
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,689
Well, Steve, it's easier
than punching cows...

40
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,098
...and it pays off with free drinks
when I walk into a saloon.

41
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,365
Would it surprise you
that the Oregon Kid is the envy...

42
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,944
...of every small-minded ribbon clerk and
shirttail towhead from here to Pocatello?

43
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,172
Well, why not?
All these single-handed exploits.

44
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,651
Tell me, Gil, who was the Omaha gang?
I don't seem to recollect them fellers.

45
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,985
Flagstaff, Monterey, Hondo,
I remember we worked them places.

46
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,356
Dodge City and Wichita.
Did you ever run with the Earp boys, Gil?

47
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,021
You gotta allow for exaggeration.
That's part of playing this game.

48
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,000
That's not much of a game.
A blind man couldn't miss using buckshot.

49
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,105
It must be something important
to bring you here.

50
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,504
Looks like you've been riding
a long time but not getting far.

51
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,076
Job.

52
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,907
You mean you're still at it?
Federal marshal?

53
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,675
No, working for the bank.

54
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,842
You, a bank guard?

55
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,683
I'm transporting gold from the mining camp
up there to the bank down here.

56
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,954
Gold bullion, $250,000 worth,
the way the letter put it.

57
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,824
A quarter of a million.

58
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,524
And I could use some help.
Can you recommend anyone?

59
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,199
- I'll give it some thought.
- You do that, will you.

60
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:50,706
- And let me know.
- I will, Steve. I surely will.

61
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,155
What do you figure we're gonna do?

62
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,926
Drink champagne, kid,
and only the best.

63
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,090
About $250,000 worth.

64
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,920
- I'd like to see Mr. Samson, please.
- He's busy.

65
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,897
Would you tell him it's Mr. Judd.
Stephen Judd.

66
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,829
Just one minute.

67
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,243
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,973
Mr. Judd.

69
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,442
Have him come in, Abner.

70
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,548
Mr. Samson will see you.

71
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,214
Thank you.

72
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,431
How do you do, Mr. Judd?

73
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,069
I'm Luther Samson,
and this is my son, Abner.

74
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,434
- He's the vice president.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Judd.

75
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:38,339
Well, I must say, Mr. Judd,
I expected a much younger man.

76
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,455
- Well, I used to be. We all used to be.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

77
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,649
Mr. Judd, we're more than familiar
with your reputation.

78
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:51,320
But that was made many years ago, and
we're dealing in the present, not the past.

79
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,865
What's the problem?

80
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,467
The Coarse Gold strike
is on the crest of the Sierras.

81
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,127
There's only one trail. One in, one out.

82
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,365
Six miners have been killed
trying to get their gold to us.

83
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,878
Six miners killed and robbed, Mr. Judd.

84
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,640
Several weeks ago we petitioned
for a marshal, but nothing happened.

85
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,148
The only law there is too drunk
to hit the ground with his hat.

86
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,483
The man we send must be completely
reliable, to say nothing of being honest.

87
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,525
We're speaking of gold, Mr. Judd.
Twenty thousand dollars worth.

88
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,355
Twenty thousand?

89
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,926
Why, I thought your letter said 250,000.

90
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,465
Our original estimate
was overly enthusiastic.

91
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,230
The strike isn't a mother lode,
but it's productive. Slow and steady.

92
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,240
- And we intend to get our share.
- The days of the forty-niners are past...

93
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,141
...and the days of the steady
businessmen have arrived.

94
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,412
My usual fee is $20 a day.
I'll have to charge you 40.

95
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,418
- Forty dollars a day?
- For what?

96
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,525
For two extra men. I don't intend
to go four days without sleeping.

97
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,957
- The question is...
- Can I do it?

98
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,653
I can't answer that by talking,
only by doing it.

99
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,927
If you two wanna talk about it,
you go ahead, and I'll read the contract.

100
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,731
Well, I guess that'll be all right.

101
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,537
- In private, if you please.
- Well...

102
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,611
...you can go in there.

103
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,322
Well, the contract's all right.
How about me? Any doubts?

104
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,828
If not, I'll sign it.

105
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,834
Well, I guess it's all right.

106
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:42,033
That old man is Steve Judd?
He don't look like much to me.

107
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,827
Son, I wore a star for six years
with that old man.

108
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,839
I was his deputy most of the time.
Once he was mine.

109
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,307
Don't ever play him short.

110
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,470
I just don't figure him
to be any trouble, that's all.

111
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,778
I hope you're right, boy.
I surely hope you're right.

112
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:04,218
I'll be at the lion. You demonstrate how
impressed you are, with your mouth shut.

113
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,620
- Hi, Mr. Westrum.
- Evening, honey.

114
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,454
Hello, Heck.

115
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,125
- Stop that!
- What did I do?

116
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,630
Never mind what you did.
Don't do it in here.

117
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,964
- Can I pick you up in an hour?
- I think so.

118
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,799
Too bad, because Heck won't be there.

119
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,841
- Why not?
- Because if I can't, you won't.

120
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,410
- Still keeping records, eh?
- You know me. Creature of habit.

121
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,984
Here's somebody who wants to know you.
My partner, Heck Longtree.

122
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,587
You'd blush to hear the way
he admires you.

123
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,815
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

124
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,754
Have a chair.

125
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,689
Showing your age, aren't you?

126
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,732
Interfering in a young man's love life.

127
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,098
He's got more important things
on his mind. Haven't you?

128
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,001
Haven't you? Yes, sir, and so have I.

129
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:59,474
Been considering your problem. Think I can
solve half, perhaps the whole thing.

130
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:05,015
I know a fellow who's got an overwhelming
hankering for a little old-time activity.

131
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:09,917
A man would have to be pretty hard up
to want to risk his life for $ 10 a day.

132
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,954
Ten dollars a day?

133
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,921
Not hard up. Just fed up.

134
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:19,053
Outshooting the rubes for nickels and dimes.
Takes all the free drinks to put me to sleep.

135
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,665
My partner feels the same way.

136
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,267
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

137
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,262
- I don't think I'd wanna hire a boy.
- Boy? What do you mean, a boy?

138
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,500
Steve, this boy's a good deal
less than green.

139
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,976
- He can't have too much behind him.
- That's where you're wrong.

140
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,674
He's been dogging after me
for better than three years.

141
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,844
Pretty.

142
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,251
Too bad he can't keep it clean.

143
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,683
Boys nowadays. No pride.
No self-respect.

144
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,091
Plenty of gall, but no sand.

145
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,721
- Now, you take that race today...
- What about that race?

146
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,666
Well, at that distance, no horse
in the world could beat a camel.

147
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,208
Are you calling me a cheat?

148
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,744
Well, if he don't, I will.

149
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,342
Go get them, tiger.
You're doing fine. Just fine.

150
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,907
- What do you think, Steve?
- I think he's wonderful.

151
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,513
He'll do. He'll do just fine.

152
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,469
What's the matter, partner?
Your rheumatism bothering you?

153
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,574
I'm used to working with my brain,
not my backside.

154
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,042
- You think you can talk him into it?
- One way or another.

155
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,343
I'd just as soon we'd split it
two ways instead of three.

156
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,386
Kid, you've got an awful lot to learn.

157
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,266
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

158
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,875
Joshua Knudsen's the name.

159
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,377
This is Gil Westrum and Heck Longtree.

160
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,812
My name is Judd. Stephen Judd.

161
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,918
- I've heard the name.
- We're on our way to Coarse Gold.

162
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,715
Could you furnish accommodations
for the night?

163
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,691
I've got no room in the house, but I have
no objection if you wanna stay in the barn.

164
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:47,295
Thank you, sir. If you could spare us a
few eggs, we'd be glad to pay for them.

165
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,300
Well, one you can have. Because
the Lord's bounty is not for sale.

166
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,030
- The rest are a dollar each.
- A dollar each?

167
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,004
How do those short-legged chickens
lay eggs so high?

168
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:01,510
Levity in the young is like unto a dry
gourd with the seeds rattling around.

169
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,879
My daughter, Elsa.

170
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,353
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

171
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,515
Likewise.

172
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,994
- Go start supper. And change that dress.
- Change it? What for?

173
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,760
For the good reason I told you to.
Did you hear what I said?

174
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,263
- I think it's a real pretty dress.
- Thank you.

175
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,281
You can put your horses
in the corral yonder.

176
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,909
Supper will be ready in an hour.
No charge. The Lord's bounty...

177
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,852
- Is not for sale.
- Thank you, sir.

178
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,652
Think of all that going to waste up here.

179
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,694
Like the fellow said,
gold is where you find it.

180
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,300
And if it's not yours, don't covet it.

181
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,060
Don't worry, boy.
The Lord's bounty may not be for sale...

182
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,867
...but the devil's is,
if you can pay the price.

183
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,976
There's a lot of truth
in those words, Heck.

184
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,744
Yeah?

185
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,354
- Yeah.
- Supper's ready.

186
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,597
Gentlemen.

187
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,389
Heavenly Father, we thank thee
for the food on this table.

188
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,897
Teach thy children to be grateful
for thy goodness...

189
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,538
...to walk in thy path...

190
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:12,969
...that they may not suffer
thy wrath and thy vengeance.

191
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,636
Bless us, O Lord,
and these our guests...

192
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,716
...and forgive them the mercenary desires
which brought them here.

193
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,777
Amen.

194
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:33,060
Thank you for entering a plea on our behalf,
but what's this about mercenary desires?

195
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,498
You're on your way to Coarse Gold.
Them that travel there do so for one reason.

196
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,569
To traffic in gold.

197
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:45,301
Which to possess is to live in fear,
to desire, to live in sorrow.

198
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,708
But we're not trafficking, sir.
Merely transporting.

199
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,318
It says in the Book, Gold is a stumbling
block to them that sacrifice to it...

200
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,750
...and every fool
shall be taken therewith.

201
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,720
A good name is rather to be chosen
than great riches.

202
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,019
A loving favor
rather than silver and gold.

203
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,924
Proverbs, chapter 22.

204
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,693
Into the land of trouble and anguish
come the old lions...

205
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,770
...and they shall carry their riches
on the shoulders of young asses...

206
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,567
...to a people that shall not profit them.

207
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,405
Isaiah, chapter 30, verse six.

208
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,377
That mining town
is a sinkhole of depravity.

209
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,216
A place of shame and sin.

210
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,912
According to Father, every place
outside this farm is a place of sin.

211
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,886
- That'll do.
- You don't have to preach at everybody.

212
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,525
That will do.

213
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,591
You cook a lovely ham hock,
Miss Knudsen. Just lovely.

214
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,699
Appetite, chapter one.

215
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,898
Give me a towel, and I'll dry.

216
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,641
Thanks just the same. You hadn't better.

217
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,862
It must be pretty lonely living up here.

218
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:20,571
Sometimes I get to thinking there's nobody
left in the world but my father and me.

219
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,123
It's a crime. A girl like you
being stuck up on this old stump ranch.

220
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,750
A girl like you ought to
be living in the city.

221
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,056
San Francisco, say.

222
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,758
- You've been there?
- Plenty of times.

223
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,237
I never been anywhere.

224
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,269
He won't even take me to town
when he goes after supplies.

225
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,571
He says the men would stare at me.

226
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:11,648
Suppose on the way back,
I was to pick you up...

227
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,081
...and take you to San Francisco...

228
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,658
...or Denver.

229
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,990
- Chicago, even.
- Elsa, who you talking to in there?

230
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,325
To myself. You'd better go.

231
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,195
- I'll meet you outside.
- I can't.

232
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,598
I'll wait for you by the corral.

233
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,552
That boy you trained personally
shows a substantial lack of judgment.

234
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,356
Showing your age, aren't you?

235
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,665
Interfering with a young man's love life?

236
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,199
Well, I'm not paying him $ 10 a day
to go mooning after some girl...

237
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,104
...whose old man's about to hind-end him
with a load of buckshot.

238
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,444
- Know who she reminds me of, Steve?
- No.

239
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,878
Sara Truesdale.

240
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,410
There's no resemblance at all.

241
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,987
Oh, maybe not in the features,
but the way she smiles.

242
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,057
There's the same look in her eyes
when you talk to her.

243
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:25,424
The kind of look that makes you feel
you've said something real important.

244
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,765
You and Sara always looked
so right together.

245
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,562
I can't say I blamed her
for not marrying you.

246
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:37,536
Forgetting the lousy money we made,
what woman wants to sit around...

247
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,645
...waiting for her husband to be
brought home with his head shot off?

248
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,377
I wonder if I can get these fixed
in Coarse Gold.

249
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:52,251
I guess losing Sara is what you might call
a hazard of our profession.

250
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:56,185
That rancher she married...
Stacey, is it?

251
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:59,589
He's doing fine up in Idaho.
Got a big ranch there.

252
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,164
Raises blooded horses.

253
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,393
- And children too, I hear.
- Grandchildren now.

254
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,068
Three of them.

255
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,143
That right, Steve?

256
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,947
Yep, that's right.

257
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,349
Three grandchildren.
Think she's happy, Steve?

258
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:30,522
If my sleeping bothers you,
don't you bother to let me know.

259
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,656
Sorry.

260
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,895
Evening.

261
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,996
- You surely took your time.
- I shouldn't be here at all.

262
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,869
Well, why? Does the night air bother you?

263
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,477
If it does, come on up in the hay.

264
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,876
I love the night air.

265
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,615
The thing is, I'm what
you might call engaged.

266
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,555
- Sure you are.
- It's the truth.

267
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,989
His name is Billy Hammond.

268
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,654
He asked me to marry him.

269
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,961
Several times.

270
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,333
I said I thought I probably would.

271
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:17,735
You'll see him in Coarse Gold. He's a miner
at the strike and doing real well.

272
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,669
Well, if he's in Coarse Gold...

273
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,479
...and you're here...

274
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,175
...I don't see any harm in talking.

275
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,280
You! Get in the barn and stay there!

276
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,028
And you, go to the house.

277
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,979
The mouth of a strange woman
is a deep pit...

278
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:05,088
...and him that is abhorred
of the Lord shall fall therein.

279
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,556
- Won't you never learn any decency?
- We were only gonna talk. Talk.

280
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:19,033
- The likes of him don't stop at talking.
- The likes of him.

281
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,900
Every man I meet
becomes "the likes of him."

282
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,042
- He's no good. I see it in his face.
- That's all you see.

283
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,338
Billy Hammond came here twice.
You said he was evil. Sinful.

284
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,107
I'm your father.
I've got to keep the dirt away.

285
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,308
- Protect you from the wrong kind of men.
- That's everyone.

286
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,614
Every single man is the wrong kind
of man. Except you.

287
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:57,532
I promised the next time you hit me,
you'd be sorry for it.

288
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,606
For my mouth shall speak truth...

289
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,272
...and wickedness
is an abomination to my lips.

290
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:10,477
All the words of my mouth
are in righteousness.

291
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,254
Elsa, I'm sorry.

292
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:28,261
Receive my instruction and not silver...

293
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,773
...and knowledge rather than choice gold.

294
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,772
For wisdom is better than rubies.

295
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,833
In about 30 years,
you'll like the feel of it too.

296
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:44,307
Pick that up. These mountains
don't need your trash.

297
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,265
Dandy pair of boots you got here.

298
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:08,064
Juan Fernandez made those boots
for me in San Antone. Special order.

299
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,697
I had a hell of a time getting him
to put that hole in there.

300
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,903
A fine craftsman, but he never did
understand the principle of ventilation.

301
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,574
I remember Juan. Always felt
the boot should cover the foot.

302
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,777
Short-sighted.

303
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:29,783
Remember old Doc Franklin, the fancy boots
he wore with the flaps over the toes?

304
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,225
Had them made in Boston.

305
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,561
- Old Doc. Know what happened to him?
- I heard he died.

306
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:40,170
That's right. Old Doc.

307
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,536
Gave 30 years of his life to make
the West safe for decent people.

308
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,872
You'd have wept to see the way they
turned out to pay tribute. Three of them.

309
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,039
The mortician,
the gravedigger and me.

310
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:57,750
Well, when I'm buried, I won't much care
who comes to the funeral.

311
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:03,758
I was commenting on the fairest flower that
grows within the human heart: Gratitude.

312
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:07,557
The only gratitude I expect
is my paycheck. Twenty dollars' worth.

313
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:12,066
- That satisfies you?
- Well, I guess that's all I can hope for.

314
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,568
Is it?

315
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,037
According to my contract, it is.
Come on, let's get moving.

316
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,813
You're wasting your breath.

317
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,746
- He don't know what you're talking about.
- He will, in time.

318
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,547
When we're ready, let's bend a gun
over his head and take the gold.

319
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,556
You couldn't get close enough
to Steve Judd to saddle his horse.

320
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,626
Well, you could.

321
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,158
Yes, I could, but I won't.

322
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,528
Unless I have to.

323
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,107
I hope heaven forgives us
for earning this easy money.

324
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,774
I seem to remember a man
hankering for some old-time activity.

325
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,683
I'd like to see some old-time mountains.

326
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:43,691
As I recall, they sure were
a lot easier to get around in.

327
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,455
You sure complain a lot in your old age.

328
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,863
Well, I got something to complain about.

329
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:56,336
You're earning twice the money
for taking the same risk.

330
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:06,178
Plus possessing all the other rewards
you've gathered...

331
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,411
...during your years of loyal service.

332
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:13,023
A bluegrass thoroughbred,
silver-mounted saddle...

333
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,819
...magnificent wardrobe. I'm envious.

334
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,157
What more could a man expect?
What more can a man hope for?

335
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,527
You forgot to mention my two-dollar watch.

336
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,237
Waste of breath.

337
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,990
What else could a man expect?

338
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,787
I got to thinking about that one time.

339
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:56,127
I keep records. When I became a lawman,
the world lost a first-class bookkeeper.

340
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,930
So to pass the time one day, I calculated
what it was worth getting shot at.

341
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,505
I figured it at about $ 100 a shot.

342
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,665
You'd have earned quite a sum by now.

343
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:09,643
Getting hit, I figure that's worth
anywhere from 1000 on up.

344
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,409
- That's 3000 I know you got coming.
- Four brings it up to date.

345
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,850
And when you tally up all those fights
and bushwhackings and cold camps...

346
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,753
...that time in Lincoln County,
five weeks in the hospital...

347
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,861
...six months out of work.
You add them all up...

348
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:29,659
...and I'd figure I was owed about all the
gold we could carry out of these mountains.

349
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,229
That's something to dream about.

350
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,239
It sure is.

351
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,873
Heck!

352
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,559
- Mind if I keep you company on the trip?
- I don't mind.

353
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,161
- I do.
- I'll second that.

354
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,266
My advice to you is turn the horse around
and ride back where you belong.

355
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:08,098
I'm not going back to my father. I'm going
to Coarse Gold to marry Billy Hammond.

356
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,832
Why do you wanna do
a foolish thing like that?

357
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,270
That's my affair.

358
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,379
She's right, Heck. Our business
is transporting gold, not girls.

359
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,742
Thanks for paying back our hospitality.

360
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,250
- Those ham hocks and everything.
- I'm a strong believer in love and gratitude...

361
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,913
...but not strong enough to bring
you along under these conditions.

362
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,353
I'll ride by myself.

363
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,926
We can make three miles
before it gets dark.

364
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,791
Right. Got to cover ground.

365
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,399
- Got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.

366
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,502
Too bad. This is certain
mountain-lion country.

367
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,898
It sure is.

368
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,563
Well, build a good fire.
It will scare them off.

369
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,003
You both go on ahead.

370
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,407
I couldn't sleep tonight
with the thought of Elsa by herself.

371
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,916
I'll stay with her and meet you
in Coarse Gold. Go on ahead.

372
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,150
Those mountain lions,
some don't scare so easy.

373
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,219
Come along, girl.

374
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:20,800
- Do you remember old man Teaford?
- Oh, yeah.

375
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,380
All night, Logan.

376
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,041
Way up, Logan.

377
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,964
You know, the way you do your hair
looks real nice.

378
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,067
You think so?

379
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,893
Pa had me cut it short.

380
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,398
It sort of fits the shape of your head,
when you see it from the side.

381
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,634
Yeah. Like that.

382
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:57,713
You know, most girls don't know
the first thing about their hair.

383
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,316
I guess you're an authority
on what most girls do.

384
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,010
Well, I've studied the subject.

385
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,055
Not just what they do, but why.

386
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,752
Now, you take this getting married.

387
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,555
Do you think that's such a good idea?

388
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,060
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.

389
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,567
My guess is, you're doing it to get away
from your pa. To get even, maybe.

390
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,401
I guess your guess
is as good as anybody's.

391
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,974
Well, if it's wrong,
how come you ran away?

392
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,380
Because my father
doesn't want me to get married.

393
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,279
Always says he does.

394
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,620
If I can find a decent young man.

395
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,719
But nobody's decent, according to him.

396
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,856
You included.

397
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,058
He said you were no good.

398
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,397
He said the likes of you
don't stop at talking.

399
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,864
You know, he has a point there.

400
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,572
Don't move!

401
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,574
Don't move, Elsa.

402
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:30,300
No! Heck, no! Let me go! No! No!

403
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,211
Let me go!

404
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,759
My, oh, my.

405
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,570
When I questioned you about him...

406
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,609
...I should've gone more
into the subject of character.

407
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,338
I hope that's a mistake
I won't live to regret.

408
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,347
Good fight. I enjoyed it.

409
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,930
That old man?

410
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,756
That old man is about half rough.

411
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:33,495
- You learned a lesson, didn't you?
- I surely did.

412
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,263
Got room for another?

413
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,498
Let her fly.

414
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,419
We're not here for romance.
Understand me, son?

415
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,248
Yes, sir.

416
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,043
I hope Mr. Judd didn't hurt you too bad.

417
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:21,782
- I guess it's kind of my fault.
- What do you mean, "kind of"?

418
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:25,183
I acted silly. I'm sorry.

419
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,017
I do like you, Heck.

420
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,990
Save the sugar talk for your Billy boy
because I don't need it.

421
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:35,792
What you need's the kind of girl who'd go
away with you to San Francisco or Denver.

422
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,399
And there's plenty of them.

423
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,935
I changed my mind.
You got just what you deserve!

424
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,399
You got something to say?

425
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:50,570
No, I think she about covered everything.

426
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,121
Lovely place. A beauty spot of nature.

427
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,961
A Garden of Eden for the sore in heart
and short of cash.

428
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,070
We didn't come here
to enjoy the scenery.

429
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:35,957
The High Sierra Crochet and Garden Society
seem to be having their weekly meeting.

430
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,489
When we get located, pass the word around
that we're in camp and ready for business.

431
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,399
And you, find out where the Hammond
claim is and take her there.

432
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,594
Why me?

433
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,229
Because Steve and I
are gonna be busy collecting gold.

434
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,839
It's not too late to change your mind.

435
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:04,681
I came to Coarse Gold to be married.
And that's what I'm gonna be. Married.

436
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,723
- Well, good luck, then.
- All the happiness in the world.

437
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,597
Welcome to Coarse Gold.

438
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,167
This seems to be the place to find it.

439
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,004
You might be in for a big surprise.

440
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,836
How do you know Billy boy
still wants to marry you?

441
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,308
What do you care?

442
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,447
I don't.

443
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,304
This the Hammond claim?

444
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,808
- Who wants to know?
- I do. I'm looking for Billy Hammond.

445
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,304
You found him.

446
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,108
Billy!

447
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,081
Howdy, Elsa!

448
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,187
I can't believe it, honey.

449
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,319
Looks like the girl he's been
going down the mountain to see.

450
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,489
I'll say one thing,
she's sure worth the trip.

451
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,163
Wish I'd got there first.

452
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,694
Looks like a warm one.

453
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,504
- Hey, where's your pa at?
- Back home.

454
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,433
You mean you run off and come
all the way up here just to see me?

455
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,771
See you?

456
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,542
I brought my mother's wedding dress.

457
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,618
- Lf you still want to.
- Lf I want to?

458
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,448
If he don't, you got four others
to choose from.

459
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,683
Sweet thing like you
ought to have the pick of the litter.

460
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,919
- No rush about making up your mind.
- Don't listen to them.

461
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,564
We're gonna get married tonight.

462
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,064
I guess that will be all, Mr. Longtree.

463
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,839
By the way...

464
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,269
...just who is Mr. Longtree?

465
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,536
I rode up with him from the farm.

466
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:16,876
- That's a couple of days on the trail.
- That's right. Two days, two nights.

467
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,885
A couple of nights.

468
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,889
A couple of nights on the trail.

469
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,921
Billy!

470
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,760
There were two other men with us
from the bank in town.

471
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,661
Besides, Mr. Longtree
was a perfect gentleman.

472
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,829
How come? Something wrong with him?

473
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:43,105
Well, now, I don't think I ever met
a perfect gentleman before, Mr. Longtree.

474
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,923
You come back and see us real soon now,
you hear, Mr. Longtree?

475
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:18,382
Jimmy, Sylvus, Elder, come on down here.
I want you to meet my woman.

476
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,008
Come on.

477
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,651
Elsa, honey, this is Jimmy.
He's sort of the baby of the family.

478
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,649
And that's Sylvus. He's been doing
our cooking, as you can see.

479
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:32,455
And the one on the end is Elder.
He's the head of the clan.

480
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:38,397
And I want you to meet my favorite brother.
Henry! Get down here now! Come on.

481
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,629
Henry's sort of our banker,
you might say.

482
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,567
Come on, honey, I'll show you my tent.

483
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,451
It looks like you've got
a pretty good claim.

484
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,760
It's a gold mine, honey.
Why don't you come over and take a look.

485
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,022
You're invited too.

486
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,799
- Find Billy Hammond?
- Yeah.

487
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,341
What's he like?

488
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,912
What difference does it make?
She wanted him, now she's got him.

489
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,309
I don't want a shave.

490
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,975
Well, Jimmy, you're gonna get shaved
whether you want to or not.

491
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,680
You've been running around
with that peach fuzz long enough.

492
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:10,520
We want that girl to know
she's marrying into a family of men.

493
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,694
Hey, Billy.

494
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,727
Thank you, Sylvus.

495
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,504
Now haul it.

496
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,208
What's that for?

497
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,277
You're leaving.

498
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,847
I see no sense in moving out
just because you're honeymooning.

499
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,687
I don't have time to explain it to you,
brother. Just get out.

500
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,490
I ain't going.

501
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,567
You just did.

502
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,336
Takes care of him.

503
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,550
- I gotta clean up in here.
- Plenty of time for that later.

504
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,953
- No. I wanna do it now.
- No, you don't.

505
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,053
- But the place is filthy.
- It'll wait. It'll wait.

506
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,357
Let go, Billy.

507
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,933
- Billy, let me go!
- All right.

508
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,669
Calm down.

509
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,234
Come on, honey.

510
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,312
See you later.

511
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,112
If you need any help...

512
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:46,723
...fastening up your wedding dress,
you just holler, you hear?

513
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,755
I'll manage.

514
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,298
First drink is best, east or west.

515
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,760
- Let him go. Turn him loose.
- There we go.

516
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,097
Jimmy, we're gonna make
a man of you now.

517
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,932
Say, Henry.

518
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:07,266
I've been wanting to ask you something.
Something's been on my mind.

519
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,242
Was you planning to bathe
for the wedding?

520
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,207
No, sir.

521
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:17,047
You ain't gonna clean up
for your brother's wedding?

522
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,287
No, sir, I ain't.

523
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,984
I didn't wash when cousin
got wed back home.

524
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:28,992
That bride didn't seem to mind none.
Did she, Billy?

525
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,768
Now there'll be none of that.

526
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,201
None of what?

527
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,504
You know something, Sylvus?

528
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,013
Billy is getting small-minded
about that woman.

529
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,515
And a might feisty.

530
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,586
A few drinks under his belt,
he'll change his mind.

531
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,724
Now, liquor always did have
a softening effect on Billy.

532
00:49:54,891 --> 00:50:00,056
I hate to get married with one of my
brothers smelling bad enough to gag a dog.

533
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,221
Yeah, that so?

534
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:06,859
You wouldn't want that sweet thing
to think we're less than quality, would you?

535
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,804
The only thing I know
is that after tonight...

536
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,340
...she ain't gonna be able
to think enough about me.

537
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,884
Get him in there.

538
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,117
All right, let him up.

539
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,990
- Henry. Henry.
- Henry.

540
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,896
- Come on now, Henry.
- Easy now.

541
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,765
- Oh, we're just funning you, Henry.
- Come on, Henry.

542
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,166
- Easy.
- Come on, Henry.

543
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,831
Put the knife up now.
You're gonna cut yourself.

544
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,170
Is that a smile I see coming on his face?

545
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,382
Easy now, Henry.

546
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,184
Come on, boys.

547
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,803
Drink to the bride!

548
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,909
Let's have a drink.

549
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,363
Stand up, judge. Here comes the bride.

550
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,366
Come on. Steady now.

551
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:04,104
Here she is, folks, my bride-to-be.
Elsa, this here's Judge Tolliver.

552
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:08,013
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
my dear.

553
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,653
And that there's Kate.
She's your bridesmaid.

554
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,788
Welcome to Kate's Place, honey.

555
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:19,020
And these ladies over here
are Sam and Rose and Belle and Candy.

556
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,893
- We're your flower girls, honey.
- You're beautiful, girls. Beautiful.

557
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,624
Aren't they beautiful, Elsa?

558
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,501
Let her roll, Charlie!

559
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,370
Drinks on the house!

560
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:14,445
You come on over and sit down, honey.
You must be tired. Poor baby.

561
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:18,384
We'll all of us have a little drinkie
before the formalities.

562
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:26,219
Now, you take this. Don't be afraid.
It'll do you good.

563
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,296
Cheers, Elsa.

564
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,269
Heck.

565
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,881
Eleven thousand,
four hundred and eighty-six.

566
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,418
That's a far cry
from a quarter of a million.

567
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,715
Fortunes of war.

568
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,949
Hardly worth it.

569
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,925
All depends on where you stand.

570
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,995
I guess that's right.

571
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:07,535
To a poor man, 11,000
is just as far away as 250,000.

572
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,271
- Where are you going?
- Out for some fresh air. Any objections?

573
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:21,316
We're gathered here in the high mountains
in the presence of this august company...

574
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:26,647
...to join this man and this woman
in matrimony.

575
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:32,352
Now, I'm not a man of the cloth,
and this is not a religious ceremony.

576
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,963
It's a civil marriage.

577
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:39,760
But it's not to be entered
into unadvisedly...

578
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,564
...but reverently and soberly.

579
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:47,837
A good marriage has a kind
of simple glory about it.

580
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:52,971
A good marriage is like a rare animal.
It's hard to find.

581
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,777
It's almost impossible to keep.

582
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,985
You see, people change.

583
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,682
That's important for you to know
at the beginning.

584
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,087
People change.

585
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:10,427
The glory of a good marriage
don't come at the beginning.

586
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,128
It comes later on.

587
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,538
It's hard work.

588
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:21,871
Billy, do you take this woman
to be your lawful-wedded wife...

589
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,503
...until God, by death, shall separate you?
- I do.

590
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,711
And do...?

591
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,113
What's your name again?

592
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,549
Elsa Knudsen.

593
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:37,056
Do you, Elsa, promise to take this man
to be your lawful-wedded husband...

594
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,422
...until death does separate you?

595
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,456
I do.

596
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,702
Do you have a ring?

597
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:55,675
Then, by the authority vested in me,
I hereby pronounce you man and wife.

598
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,779
All right, girls, change your clothes.

599
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,890
Henry! Henry, Henry!

600
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,398
No, no. Sylvus, Sylvus.
Now that's enough, Sylvus.

601
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,185
Hey, bartender, pour a little more.

602
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,521
No use standing here
tormenting yourself, son.

603
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,867
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

604
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,263
What a party!

605
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,940
Come on, Billy. Come on, get over there
and get acquainted around.

606
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,786
Let me in there. Let me in there.

607
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,592
- Have fun, honey.
- Billy!

608
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,295
Billy!

609
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,733
Come on, now. It's my turn, Sylvus.

610
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:32,299
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, wait.

611
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:33,806
You had your turn.

612
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:37,174
It looks like Jimmy's making a man
out of himself.

613
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:43,018
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, don't be like that, Sylvus.

614
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,215
Oh, come on now.

615
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,983
Now, Sylvus, we got a nice party.
Now, why don't you behave yourself.

616
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,489
You can't hit my brother!

617
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,228
Don't leave me.

618
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,533
I wish I'd known more
about those brothers.

619
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,297
It's too late now.

620
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:08,036
- She's married.
- Glad they didn't invite me to the ceremony.

621
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,611
I always cry at weddings.

622
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,183
The more I am around you, the more
I can do without your sense of humor.

623
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,876
Come on, break it up!
Boys, get over there!

624
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,080
Now I said, break it up,
and I mean it. Get over there.

625
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:24,249
Come on, Sylvus, get over here
and behave yourself.

626
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,224
Get over there!

627
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,534
- No, Billy.
- Come on.

628
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,326
No.

629
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,673
Well, now, get on in there!

630
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,253
Easy now, Elsa.

631
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,357
Listen, Elsa, you come here!

632
00:59:55,525 --> 01:00:00,519
No, Billy! No, Billy! No! Not here!

633
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,658
No, Billy!

634
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,858
Now, you straighten out,
you hear me?

635
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,451
Where's Billy?

636
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,517
I've got some prying brothers.

637
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,842
You stay here.

638
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,272
She's mine. She's mine. Let go, Henry.

639
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,244
- Elsa!
- Henry, turn loose of me!

640
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,543
I'm gonna get you.

641
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,717
- Come back, Elsa. Come back.
- Come back, girl.

642
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,355
Come on, get your bride.
Billy, get your bride.

643
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,494
Hold it!

644
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,542
Let her go.

645
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,379
- Where are you going with my wife?
- She'll stay with us.

646
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:38,755
- I'm taking her to her father in the morning.
- Like hell she will.

647
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,159
You can't take a wife from her husband.

648
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,303
Clear case of breaking and entering.

649
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,931
Elsa's legally married to Billy. Right?

650
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,508
I now pronounce you man and wife.

651
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,339
- And don't you forget it.
- Go along, Elsa.

652
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:00,975
Heck.

653
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:08,023
You're not leaving this camp with her.
I'll promise you that.

654
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,334
Go home, Billy.

655
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,472
What happened? You all right, Billy?

656
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,905
Where is she? Where is she?
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

657
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,170
- Billy!
- Where'd he go with her?

658
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:33,782
- Come on.
- Why'd you let him get away with her?

659
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,618
The marriage didn't work.
We have to take her to her father.

660
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:48,287
- Steve, we've got our hands full already.
- I don't like it any better than you do.

661
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,339
Too big, huh?

662
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,052
What are they doing there?

663
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:25,132
We're willing to abide
by the court's decision if you are.

664
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,332
We'll abide.

665
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,030
Don't be scared.

666
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,421
- What's wrong?
- Billy Hammond wants Elsa.

667
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,957
They appointed a miners' court
to decide it.

668
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,721
- Miners' court?
- That's the law, places like this.

669
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,864
- Who says?
- They do.

670
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,728
And there's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

671
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,732
Billy's sorry about last night.

672
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,030
Swears it won't happen again. I believe him.

673
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:06,232
- I wouldn't believe Billy...
- I don't wanna go back to him.

674
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:09,003
You were legally married
of your own free will.

675
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:12,471
Please. You can't let him
take me back. You can't.

676
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,549
But whatever they decide,
that will have to be it.

677
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:19,814
That don't have to be it. She's not
going with him. She stays with us.

678
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,856
She stays here!
We're packing gold, not petticoats.

679
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,986
If she stays, I stay.

680
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:33,000
Well, let's hope the court
lets her go with us.

681
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,933
Otherwise, we'll be a little short-handed.

682
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:54,250
All right, gentlemen, we can proceed.

683
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:59,417
In the first place, I married this gal here last
night, right up on the hill in Kate's Place.

684
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,655
- You saw Judge Tolliver...
- Where can I find Judge Tolliver?

685
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:06,768
- At the end of the hall, mister.
- He married us legal and proper.

686
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,314
Easy. Sit up.

687
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,221
A little more.

688
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,941
Thank you, sir.

689
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,617
What can I do for you?

690
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,185
Clear up a little technicality,
if you will.

691
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,845
About that marriage last night.

692
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:04,789
They're holding a miners' court,
and they'll wanna know if it was legal.

693
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,253
- Of course it was legal.
- Well, I believe that.

694
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,696
But the court may want proof,
in the form of a license.

695
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,562
You got one?

696
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,348
Signed by the governor of California.

697
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:34,580
Yes, sir, there's no question at all
about the legality of this document.

698
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,952
Now, when you testify
before that miners' court...

699
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,027
...l'm gonna ask you one question:

700
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,529
"Do you possess a license
to marry people in California?"

701
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,499
And you're gonna answer, "No."
Am I clear?

702
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,770
- That's a lie.
- No, it isn't. You don't possess it. I do.

703
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,875
- Now, see here...
- Listen to me!

704
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,603
You're gonna do as you're told.
Understand?

705
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:04,047
Now, do you recall the question
I'm gonna ask?

706
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,887
And what do you answer?

707
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,546
No.

708
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:10,949
Very good.

709
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,987
Let's go.

710
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:13,112
According to the law,
she's still married to Billy Hammond.

711
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:16,156
You and the law.
She can get it nullified.

712
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,987
Will that satisfy
your ironbound code of ethics?

713
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,324
My code satisfies pretty easy, partner.

714
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:26,264
Would it surprise you to know
that I was once a lawbreaker?

715
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,871
Well, bless my stars.

716
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:35,067
About the age of that boy back there.
Skinny as a snake and just about as mean.

717
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,303
Ran with the Hole-in-the-Wall bunch.

718
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:41,314
Gun-happy, looking for trouble
or a pretty ankle.

719
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,052
Had the world by the tail,
so to speak.

720
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,115
Then one night,
Paul Staniford picked me up.

721
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,348
He was sheriff of Madera County then.

722
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:53,757
There'd been a fight, and I was drunk.
Sicker than a fat dog.

723
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,896
He dried me out in jail,
and then we went out back...

724
01:08:57,066 --> 01:09:00,661
...and he proceeded to kick
the bitter hell right out of me.

725
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,497
That took some doing.

726
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:05,936
Not much. You see,
he was right, I was wrong.

727
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,008
That makes the difference.

728
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:09,838
Who says so?

729
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:12,981
Nobody. That's something you just know.

730
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,449
Anyhow, when I was able to walk again,
I realized I'd learned a lesson from him.

731
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,616
The value of self-respect.

732
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:21,847
What's that worth on the open market?

733
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:25,983
Nothing to some people,
but a great deal to me.

734
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,752
But I lost it.

735
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,060
These last years, the only work
I was able to get was places like Kate's.

736
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:35,169
Bartender, stick man, bouncer,
what have you.

737
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,601
Not much to brag on.

738
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,840
Now I'm getting back
a little respect for myself.

739
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:45,447
I intend to keep it with the help of you
and that boy back there.

740
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:49,410
- Good to be working again, Gil.
- Yeah.

741
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,911
You know what's on the back
of a poor man when he dies?

742
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,578
The clothes of pride.

743
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:59,924
And they're not a bit warmer to him dead
than they were when he was alive.

744
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:05,191
Is that all you want, Steve?

745
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:12,098
All I want is to enter my house justified.

746
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,711
Thank you.

747
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,181
Will you stay in town
when we get back?

748
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,949
I'm not just certain. Why?

749
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:46,164
You're right, kid. I've been wasting
my breath. Tonight we move.

750
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,476
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

751
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,541
I started out thinking
he was an old mossback...

752
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:56,082
...but I changed my mind.
Kind of hate to turn against him.

753
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,083
Are you with me or not?

754
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,984
- What will happen to Elsa?
- He'll deliver her.

755
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:05,252
The thing for you to remember
is that we made a deal.

756
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,322
Yes, sir.

757
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,780
It all pointed this way.

758
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:05,386
All that talk about old Doc Franklin,
ungrateful citizens.

759
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:09,581
- What we had coming but never got paid.
- It's the truth, isn't it, Steve?

760
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:14,421
I knew in my bones what you were
aiming for, but I wouldn't believe it.

761
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,928
I kept telling myself
you were a good man.

762
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,228
- You were my friend.
- This is bank money, not yours.

763
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,701
And what they don't know
won't hurt them.

764
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,170
Not them. Only me!

765
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:33,478
Take off your gun belt
and toss it over here.

766
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,718
What are you gonna do?

767
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,863
You always fancied yourself
faster than me.

768
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,736
Go ahead, draw.

769
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,202
Draw, you damned tinhorn!

770
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,851
That was your second mistake...

771
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:20,051
...and the last chance
you'll ever get from me.

772
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:23,624
I'm gonna put you behind bars, Gil.

773
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:25,824
You'll play hell getting it done.

774
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,459
Move!

775
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,785
My, oh, my, will you look who's here.

776
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:28,123
Howdy. You made pure fools out of us,
stealing that license from Tolliver.

777
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,323
The judge says there's another one
on file in Sacramento.

778
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,095
That means she's still my wife.
Come on, honey, let's go home.

779
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,261
She stays with us.

780
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,434
Looks to me like you been
having some trouble.

781
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:45,239
Looks to me like somebody got their finger
caught in the cookie jar.

782
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,975
You're short-handed, old-timer,
but she's all we want.

783
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,415
All we want,
provided we get her now.

784
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:55,386
- You heard me.
- We'll get her, sooner or later.

785
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:56,956
Like hell you will!

786
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:01,290
You better cut yourself a switch,
Mr. Longtree.

787
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,364
I don't think you
could handle me barehanded.

788
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:08,162
You all are gonna get yourself
a chance to try, directly.

789
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,565
Come on.

790
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:20,910
Do I have your word you'll return your gun
when this is over?

791
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,482
Yes, sir, I reckon you do.

792
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:29,724
- I'll go along.
- You bet you'll go along.

793
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,951
- We're moving into the rocks.
- Steve!

794
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,823
Shut up! Move!

795
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,464
Move out!

796
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,141
You're really showing your age.

797
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:33,812
Back in the old days, you'd have checked
those rifles before we left camp.

798
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,526
I'll get around behind them.

799
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:46,332
Don't waste your time.
They're too far away.

800
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:55,234
He's going around behind us.
Cut me loose and give me a gun.

801
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,674
I'll get a rifle for you.

802
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,480
Start shooting.

803
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,677
Sylvus!

804
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,311
Sylvus!

805
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:14,652
- He was carrying a rifle.
- Let's get out of here!

806
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:34,040
- Looks like they got Sylvus.
- I know that. Come on! We're getting out.

807
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:38,077
You got two brothers dead,
you talk about running?

808
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:39,611
Come on!

809
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,546
I wonder where those other three went.

810
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:24,317
- I hope they're not still following us.
- Calm your fears, honey.

811
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:27,929
My guess is, they gave up
and went back to Coarse Gold.

812
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:31,697
Assuming that's so,
I'll have your gun back.

813
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,436
Do you hear me, boy?

814
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:55,653
I'm sorry, Mr. Judd.
I guess I was showing off.

815
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:02,789
- What happens when we get to town?
- It's up to the sheriff.

816
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:07,128
He's turning us in.
You know that. So do I.

817
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:16,169
- Ever hear of Folsom Prison, Heck?
- No.

818
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,141
Well, it's solid rock.

819
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,804
During the years we spend there
we'll discuss...

820
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:24,247
...the events of the past few minutes
at great length.

821
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:28,719
And by the time you get out, you won't
like him any better than I do now...

822
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:31,586
...which isn't one hell of a lot.
Where do I sleep?

823
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,528
Up there. I don't wanna see you
till breakfast.

824
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:43,966
Cut me loose, Steve.

825
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,433
Why?

826
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,240
Because I don't sleep so good anymore.

827
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,125
- Good night.
- Good night.

828
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,736
My father says
there's only right and wrong...

829
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,235
...good and evil.

830
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,807
Nothing in between.

831
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:31,978
- It isn't that simple, is it?
- No, it isn't. It should be, but it isn't.

832
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:34,417
What's gonna happen to him?

833
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:39,420
The boy? I'll testify for him.
They shouldn't be too hard.

834
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,856
Will you testify for Mr. Westrum?

835
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:46,758
- No, I won't.
- Why?

836
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,326
Because he was my friend.

837
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,329
- How come he don't tie us up?
- What for?

838
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,475
No place to go.

839
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:58,511
He's got the horses,
and he's got the guns.

840
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,207
And it wouldn't take long
for Steve Judd to find us.

841
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,050
Wait a minute, kid.
I just had a thought.

842
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:09,384
Well, keep it to yourself.
I'm fed up with you and your ideas.

843
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,665
That's all right.

844
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,033
That's all right.

845
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,009
- Morning.
- Morning.

846
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:41,955
- Where's Gil?
- Gone.

847
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:45,583
Why didn't you go with him?

848
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:49,023
Because I didn't see any future
in our partnership.

849
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,944
Come on.

850
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:46,019
Get up there!

851
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,651
You wait here.

852
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,783
I'll go down and take a look around.

853
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:42,204
- The old gent's taking quite a chance.
- I don't think so.

854
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,345
Neither does he.

855
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,477
I never figured
it would turn out this way.

856
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:54,511
Chances are I'll be locked up for a while.
I've got no call to bring it up.

857
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,747
- But maybe when I get out...
- I'll be there.

858
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:21,413
I saw your father. Everything's all right.

859
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,588
What are you doing?

860
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:17,062
- That's strange.
- What?

861
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:20,458
He goes to her grave every day
but always in the morning.

862
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:22,125
Never in the afternoon.

863
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,234
We're going to the ditch.

864
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,500
Now!

865
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,491
I walked right into it.

866
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,697
I'm gonna try for the corral.

867
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:40,437
I got him.

868
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:00,734
Well, where's the rifle?

869
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:03,665
On the horse.

870
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:09,434
Bad?

871
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,235
Not yet.

872
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,350
Partner, what do you think?

873
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:24,620
Let's meet them head-on, halfway,
just like always.

874
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,192
My sentiments exactly.

875
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,422
- You, Hammonds!
- What do you want, old man?

876
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:33,929
He wants a shovel and six feet of dirt.

877
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:36,330
You redneck peckerwoods.

878
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:39,996
You're too chicken-gutted
to finish this thing out in the open.

879
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:48,110
Two old men
against all three of you boys.

880
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:52,446
And if them odds ain't enough for you
damned dry-gulching Southern trash...

881
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:56,556
...we'll send out the girl.
- We're coming!

882
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,988
- You hear me, Henry?
- Yeah, I hear you.

883
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,458
You don't have to ask me twice!

884
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:04,157
Now, you hold on, Billy.

885
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:09,269
- We'll catch them when they raise up.
- Ain't you got no sense of family honor?

886
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,364
Start the ball, old man.

887
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:48,560
How'd we figure?

888
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:51,738
- A thousand dollars a shot?
- Yeah.

889
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:55,867
Those boys sure made me
a lot of money.

890
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,406
They put them all in one spot.

891
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,520
I don't want them to see this.

892
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:13,185
I'll go it alone.

893
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:26,138
Don't worry about anything.

894
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:30,332
I'll take care of it,
just like you would have.

895
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:34,510
Hell, I know that.

896
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:36,843
I always did.

897
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:40,648
You just forgot it for a while, that's all.

898
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:46,159
So long, partner.

899
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:57,437
I'll see you later.

900
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,773
