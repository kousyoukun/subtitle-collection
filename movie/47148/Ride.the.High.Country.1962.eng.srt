1
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:44,395
Come on, kids, out of the street.
Come on, kids, get back there.

2
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,353
Hey, you. Get out of there!

3
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:11,793
Get out of the street!

4
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,722
Get out of the street!
Clear the street!

5
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,048
Get away from there!

6
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,967
Get out of the way, old man.
can't you hear?

7
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,814
can't you see you're in the way?
Get out of here!

8
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,650
- All right.
- Out of the way!

9
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:52,046
Watch out, old-timer.

10
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:09,106
You got a good horse, but not
good enough. I'll have that dollar.

11
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:11,768
I'm beginning to figure
these races smell bad.

12
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:14,069
That thing never loses.

13
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,574
- You had your chance.
- Well, let's just say I'm a poor loser.

14
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,238
So if you want this dollar...

15
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:22,863
...you just come right on over here
and get it, sonny boy.

16
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,684
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

17
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:57,279
Step right up and try your luck.
Everybody welcome.

18
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,526
See the Oregon Kid in person.

19
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:02,869
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

20
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,708
Step right up and outshoot
the famous Oregon Kid.

21
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,116
The last of the Western town-tamers.

22
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:12,920
Fatten your wallets and be a hero
to your family. Everybody welcome.

23
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,633
Step up. Try your luck. All you gotta do
is hit the plates, and you win the money.

24
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:22,132
- Quit the sermon and turn her loose.
- One dollar on the yellow.

25
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:37,527
Shooting against you is like
sneaking licorice from a baby girI.

26
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,440
Care to try again?

27
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:57,668
Mister, could I make a 10-cent bet?

28
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:01,176
A whole dime? You're a plunger, sir.

29
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:06,174
Well, I ain't so altogether sure I could
hit a moving target without buckshot.

30
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:08,558
I used to be fair with a scattergun...

31
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,726
...but then that was when the bird
wasn't too far away or flying too fast.

32
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,268
Them plates, I just don't see
how you manage.

33
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:19,819
Well, I'll be damned.

34
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,148
- How are you, GiI?
- No great complaints.

35
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,733
How long has it been?
Lordy, I'd hate to say.

36
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,322
Quite some time.

37
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:28,323
Where you been all these years?

38
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:32,543
Here and there.
Quite a little enterprise you've got.

39
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:37,164
Well, Steve, it's easier
than punching cows...

40
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,674
...and it pays off with free drinks
when I walk into a saloon.

41
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:43,845
Would it surprise you
that the Oregon Kid is the envy...

42
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:48,510
...of every small-minded ribbon clerk and
shirttaiI towhead from here to Pocatello?

43
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:51,769
Well, why not?
All these single-handed exploits.

44
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:57,229
Tell me, GiI, who was the Omaha gang?
I don't seem to recollect them fellers.

45
00:05:57,402 --> 00:06:01,565
Flagstaff, Monterey, Hondo,
I remember we worked them places.

46
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,951
Dodge City and Wichita.
Did you ever run with the Earp boys, GiI?

47
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:09,702
You gotta allow for exaggeration.
That's part of playing the game.

48
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:13,573
That's not much of a game. A blind man
couldn't miss using buckshot.

49
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:16,586
It must be something important
to bring you here.

50
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:20,088
Looks like you've been riding
a long time but not getting far.

51
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:21,669
Job.

52
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,512
You mean you're still at it?
FederaI marshaI?

53
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:27,252
No, working for the bank.

54
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:29,424
You, a bank guard?

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,262
I'm transporting gold from the mining
camp up there to the bank down here.

56
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,567
Gold bullion, $250,000 worth,
the way the letter put it.

57
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:40,397
A quarter of a million.

58
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,104
And I could use some help.
Can you recommend anyone?

59
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,785
- I'll give it some thought.
- You do that, will you?

60
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:53,282
- And let me know.
- I will, Steve. I surely will.

61
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,757
What do you figure we're gonna do?

62
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:13,509
Drink champagne, kid,
and only the best.

63
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:17,684
About $250,000 worth.

64
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:44,501
- I'd like to see Mr. Samson, please.
- He's busy.

65
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:49,460
Would you tell him it's Mr. Judd.
Stephen Judd.

66
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,432
Just one minute.

67
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,813
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:03,564
Mr. Judd.

69
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,028
Have him come in, Abner.

70
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:14,153
Mr. Samson will see you.

71
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,824
Thank you.

72
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:23,999
How do you do, Mr. Judd?

73
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,663
I'm Luther Samson,
and this is my son, Abner.

74
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:30,839
- He's the vice president.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Judd.

75
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:40,930
Well, I must say, Mr. Judd,
I expected a much younger man.

76
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:46,017
- Well, I used to be. We all used to be.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

77
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:49,230
Mr. Judd, we're more than familiar
with your reputation.

78
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:53,902
But that was made many years ago, and
we're dealing in the present, not the past.

79
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,453
What's the problem?

80
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,159
The Coarsegold strike
is on the crest of the Sierras.

81
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,704
There's only one traiI. One in, one out.

82
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,376
Six miners have been killed
trying to get their gold to us.

83
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:08,464
Six miners killed and robbed, Mr. Judd.

84
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:12,216
SeveraI weeks ago we petitioned
for a marshaI, but nothing happened.

85
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:15,720
The only law there is too drunk
to hit the ground with his hat.

86
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,054
The man we send must be completely
reliable, to say nothing of being honest.

87
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:24,095
We're speaking of gold, Mr. Judd.
Twenty thousand dollars worth.

88
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:25,934
Twenty thousand?

89
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:28,517
Why, I thought your letter said 250,000.

90
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:32,064
Our originaI estimate
was overly enthusiastic.

91
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,822
The strike isn't a mother lode,
but it's productive. Slow and steady.

92
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:39,991
- And we intend to get our share.
- The days of the forty-niners are past...

93
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:43,747
...and the days of the steady
businessmen have arrived.

94
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,000
My usuaI fee is $20 a day.
I'll have to charge you 40.

95
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,001
- Forty dollars a day?
- For what?

96
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:56,090
For two extra men. I don't intend
to go four days without sleeping.

97
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,422
- The question is-
- Can I do it?

98
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,269
I can't answer that by talking,
only by doing it.

99
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,516
If you two wanna talk about it,
you go ahead, and I'll read the contract.

100
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,308
Well, I guess that'll be all right.

101
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:14,109
- In private, if you please.
- Well...

102
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:16,191
...you can go in there.

103
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,917
Well, the contract's all right.
How about me? Any doubts?

104
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,419
If not, I'll sign it.

105
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,416
Well, I guess it's all right.

106
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,611
That old man is Steve Judd?
He don't look like much to me.

107
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,414
Son, I wore a star for six years
with that old man.

108
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,415
I was his deputy most of the time.
Once he was mine.

109
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,876
Don't ever play him short.

110
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,049
I just don't figure him
to be any trouble, that's all.

111
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,381
I hope you're right, boy.
I surely hope you're right.

112
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:07,264
I'll be at the lion. You demonstrate how
impressed you are, with your mouth shut.

113
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,305
- Hi, Mr. Westrum.
- Evening, honey.

114
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,058
Hello, Heck.

115
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,724
- Stop that!
- What did I do?

116
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,736
Never mind what you did.
Don't do it in here.

117
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,573
- Can I pick you up in an hour?
- I think so.

118
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,410
Too bad, because Heck won't be there.

119
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,408
- Why not?
- Because if I can't, you won't.

120
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,001
- Still keeping records, eh?
- You know me. Creature of habit.

121
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,585
Somebody else wants to know you.
My partner, Heck Longtree.

122
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,164
You'd blush to hear the way
he admires you.

123
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,418
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

124
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,338
Have a chair.

125
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,263
Showing your age, aren't you?

126
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,305
Interfering in a young man's love life.

127
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,682
He's got more important things
on his mind. Haven't you?

128
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,562
Haven't you? Yes, sir, and so have I.

129
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:02,064
Been considering your problem. Think
I can solve half, perhaps the whole thing.

130
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,157
I know a fellow who's got
an overwhelming hankering...

131
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,615
...for a little old-time activity.

132
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,496
A man would have to be pretty hard up
to want to risk his life for $ 10 a day.

133
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,540
Ten dollars a day?

134
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,502
Not hard up. Just fed up.

135
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,629
Outshooting rubes for nickels and dimes.
Takes free drinks to put me to sleep.

136
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,256
My partner feels the same way.

137
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,842
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

138
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,847
- I don't think I'd wanna hire a boy.
- What do you mean, a boy?

139
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,102
Steve, this boy's a good deaI
less than green.

140
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,557
- He can't have much behind him.
- That's where you're wrong.

141
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,268
He's been dogging after me
for better than three years.

142
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,441
Pretty.

143
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,821
Too bad he can't keep it clean.

144
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,284
Boys nowadays. No pride.
No self-respect.

145
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,661
Plenty of gall, but no sand.

146
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,332
- Now, you take that race today-
- What about that race?

147
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,251
Well, at that distance, no horse
in the world could beat a cameI.

148
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,795
Are you calling me a cheat?

149
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,344
Well, if he don't, I will.

150
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,921
Go get them, tiger.
You're doing fine. Just fine.

151
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:14,486
- What do you think, Steve?
- I think he's wonderfuI.

152
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:18,078
He'll do. He'll do just fine.

153
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:43,062
What's the matter, partner?
Your rheumatism bothering you?

154
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:46,150
I'm used to working with my brain,
not my backside.

155
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:52,614
- You think you can talk him into it?
- One way or another.

156
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,950
I'd just as soon we'd split it
two ways instead of three.

157
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,955
Kid, you've got an awfuI lot to learn.

158
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,863
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

159
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,454
Joshua Knudsen's the name.

160
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,961
This is GiI Westrum and Heck Longtree.

161
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:34,381
My name is Judd. Stephen Judd.

162
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:37,594
- I've heard the name.
- We're on our way to coarsegold.

163
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:40,301
Could you furnish accommodations
for the night?

164
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:45,266
I've got no room in the house, but I won't
object if you wanna stay in the barn.

165
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:49,891
Thank you, sir. If you could spare us a
few eggs, we'd be glad to pay for them.

166
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:53,898
Well, one you can have. Because
the Lord's bounty is not for sale.

167
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,608
- The rest are a dollar each.
- A dollar each?

168
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:59,569
How do those short-legged chickens
lay eggs so high?

169
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:04,072
Levity in the young is like unto a dry
gourd with the seeds rattling around.

170
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:14,454
My daughter, Elsa.

171
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:17,084
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

172
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,383
- Likewise.
- Go start supper.

173
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:22,590
- And change that dress.
- Change it? What for?

174
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:26,348
For the good reason I told you to.
Did you hear what I said?

175
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:31,856
- I think it's a reaI pretty dress.
- Thank you.

176
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:41,857
Put your horses in the corraI yonder.

177
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:45,486
Supper will be ready in an hour.
No charge. The Lord's bounty-

178
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:48,450
- Is not for sale.
- Thank you, sir.

179
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:51,246
Think of all that going to waste up here.

180
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,290
Like the fellow said,
gold is where you find it.

181
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:57,880
And if it's not yours, don't covet it.

182
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:01,635
<i>Don't worry.
The Lord's bounty may not be for sale...</i>

183
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:05,469
<i>...but the deviI's is,
if you can pay the price.</i>

184
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,560
There's a lot of truth
in those words, Heck.

185
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:17,312
Yeah?

186
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,941
- Yeah.
- Supper's ready.

187
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,173
Gentlemen.

188
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:02,986
Heavenly Father, we thank thee
for the food on this table.

189
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:07,483
Teach thy children to be gratefuI
for thy goodness...

190
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:10,117
...to walk in thy path...

191
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:15,539
...that they may not suffer
thy wrath and thy vengeance.

192
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:18,202
Bless us, O Lord,
and these our guests...

193
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,294
...and forgive them the mercenary
desires which brought them here.

194
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,384
Amen.

195
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:35,554
Thanks for entering a plea on our behalf,
but what's this about mercenary desires?

196
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:40,060
You're on your way to coarsegold. Them
that traveI there do so for one reason.

197
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:42,144
To traffic in gold.

198
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,907
Which to possess is to live in fear,
to desire, to live in sorrow.

199
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:51,279
But we're not trafficking, sir.
Merely transporting.

200
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:56,829
It says in the Book, Gold is a stumbling
block to them that sacrifice to it...

201
00:20:57,002 --> 00:20:59,327
...and every fooI
shall be taken therewith.

202
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:02,339
A good name is rather to be chosen
than great riches.

203
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:05,592
A loving favor
rather than silver and gold.

204
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,504
Proverbs, chapter 22.

205
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,258
Into the land of trouble and anguish
come the old lions...

206
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:16,348
...and they shall carry their riches
on the shoulders of young asses...

207
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:19,142
...to a people that shall not profit them.

208
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:22,981
Isaiah, chapter 30, verse six.

209
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:25,940
That mining town
is a sinkhole of depravity.

210
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:28,780
A place of shame and sin.

211
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,449
According to Father, every place
outside this farm is a place of sin.

212
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,456
- That'll do.
- You don't have to preach at everybody.

213
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:37,118
That will do.

214
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:44,163
You cook a lovely ham hock,
Miss Knudsen. Just lovely.

215
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:47,291
Appetite, chapter one.

216
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:53,463
Give me a toweI, and I'll dry.

217
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:57,227
Thanks just the same. You hadn't better.

218
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:17,449
It must be pretty lonely living up here.

219
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:23,165
Sometimes I think there's nobody
left in the world but my father and me.

220
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:42,678
It's a crime. A girI like you
being stuck up on this old stump ranch.

221
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:46,356
A girI like you ought to
be living in the city.

222
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:48,650
San Francisco, say.

223
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:52,356
- You've been there?
- Plenty of times.

224
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,817
I never been anywhere.

225
00:22:57,204 --> 00:23:00,869
He won't even take me to town
when he goes after supplies.

226
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,161
He says the men would stare at me.

227
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:14,218
Suppose on the way back,
I was to pick you up...

228
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,672
...and take you to San Francisco...

229
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:18,224
...or Denver.

230
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:21,559
- Chicago, even.
- Elsa, who you talking to in there?

231
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:24,017
To myself. You'd better go.

232
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:25,933
- I'll meet you outside.
- I can't.

233
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:28,184
I'll wait for you by the corraI.

234
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:53,134
That boy you trained personally
shows a substantiaI lack of judgment.

235
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:54,926
Showing your age, aren't you?

236
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,265
Interfering with a young man's love life?

237
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,765
Well, I'm not paying him $ 10 a day
to go mooning after some girI...

238
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:07,686
<i>...whose old man's about
to hind-end him with a load of buckshot.</i>

239
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:12,023
- Know who she reminds me of, Steve?
- No.

240
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,437
Sara Truesdale.

241
00:24:15,407 --> 00:24:17,067
There's no resemblance at all.

242
00:24:17,242 --> 00:24:20,575
Oh, maybe not in the features,
but the way she smiles.

243
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:23,746
There's the same look in her eyes
when you talk to her.

244
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:27,995
The kind of look that makes you feeI
you've said something reaI important.

245
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:31,332
You and Sara always looked
so right together.

246
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:34,127
I can't say I blamed her
for not marrying you.

247
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:40,138
Forgetting the lousy money we made,
what woman wants to sit around...

248
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:44,221
...waiting for her husband to be
brought home with his head shot off?

249
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:49,977
I wonder if I can get these fixed
in Coarsegold.

250
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,811
I guess losing Sara is what you
might call a hazard of our profession.

251
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:58,779
That rancher she married...
Stacey, is it?

252
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:02,153
He's doing fine up in Idaho.
Got a big ranch there.

253
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,736
Raises blooded horses.

254
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:08,995
- And children too, I hear.
- Grandchildren now.

255
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,662
Three of them.

256
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:14,712
That right, Steve?

257
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,504
Yep, that's right.

258
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:22,927
Three grandchildren.
Think she's happy, Steve?

259
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:33,102
If my sleeping bothers you,
don't you bother to let me know.

260
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:35,234
Sorry.

261
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,488
Evening.

262
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:44,570
- You surely took your time.
- I shouldn't be here at all.

263
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:47,450
Well, why? Does the night air
bother you?

264
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:50,031
If it does, come on up in the hay.

265
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,451
I love the night air.

266
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:02,213
The thing is, I'm what
you might call engaged.

267
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:05,139
- Sure you are.
- It's the truth.

268
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,556
His name is Billy Hammond.

269
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:10,222
He asked me to marry him.

270
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:12,556
SeveraI times.

271
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:15,894
I said I thought I probably would.

272
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:20,321
You'll see him in coarsegold. He's
a miner at the strike, doing reaI well.

273
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,241
<i>Well, if he's in coarsegold...</i>

274
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:28,072
<i>...and you're here...</i>

275
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:30,738
<i>...I don't see any harm in talking.</i>

276
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,870
You! Get in the barn and stay there!

277
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,586
And you, go to the house.

278
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:03,570
The mouth of a strange woman
is a deep pit...

279
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,654
...and him that is abhorred
of the Lord shall fall therein.

280
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:18,127
- Won't you never learn any decency?
- We were only gonna talk. Talk.

281
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:21,630
- The likes of him don't stop at talking.
- The likes of him.

282
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,469
Every man I meet
becomes "the likes of him. "

283
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:27,720
- He's no good. I see it in his face.
- That's all you see.

284
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:30,926
Billy Hammond came here twice.
You said he was eviI.

285
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:33,674
I'm your father.
I've got to keep the dirt away.

286
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:37,020
- Protect you from the wrong kind of men.
- That's everyone.

287
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,191
Every single man is the wrong kind
of man. Except you.

288
00:27:55,583 --> 00:28:00,126
I promised the next time you hit me,
you'd be sorry for it.

289
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:04,172
For my mouth shall speak truth...

290
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:07,841
...and wickedness
is an abomination to my lips.

291
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:13,053
All the words of my mouth
are in righteousness.

292
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:17,847
Elsa, I'm sorry.

293
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:30,862
Receive my instruction and not silver...

294
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:34,369
...and knowledge rather
than choice gold.

295
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:40,369
For wisdom is better than rubies.

296
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,435
In about 30 years,
you'll like the feeI of it too.

297
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:46,901
Pick that up. These mountains
don't need your trash.

298
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,832
Dandy pair of boots you got here.

299
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:10,631
Juan Fernandez made those boots
for me in San Antone. SpeciaI order.

300
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:14,216
I had a hell of a time getting him
to put that hole in there.

301
00:30:14,388 --> 00:30:18,468
A fine craftsman, but he never did
understand the principle of ventilation.

302
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:23,138
I remember Juan. Always felt
the boot should cover the foot.

303
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:25,352
Short-sighted.

304
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:32,362
Remember Doc Franklin, the fancy boots
he wore with the flaps over the toes?

305
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,819
Had them made in Boston.

306
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,151
- Old Doc. Know what happened to him?
- I heard he died.

307
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:42,745
That's right. Old Doc.

308
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:47,127
Gave 30 years of his life to make
the West safe for decent people.

309
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:51,459
You'd have wept to see the way they
turned out to pay tribute. Three of them.

310
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,634
The mortician,
the gravedigger and me.

311
00:30:55,094 --> 00:31:00,337
Well, when I'm buried, I won't
much care who comes to the funeraI.

312
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:04,846
I was commenting on the fairest flower
that grows within the human heart:

313
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:06,349
Gratitude.

314
00:31:06,522 --> 00:31:10,141
The only gratitude I expect
is my paycheck. Twenty dollars' worth.

315
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:14,647
- That satisfies you?
- Well, I guess that's all I can hope for.

316
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:16,151
Is it?

317
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:19,609
According to my contract, it is.
come on, let's get moving.

318
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:29,287
- He don't know what you're talking about.
- He will, in time.

319
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:33,127
When we're ready, let's bend a gun
over his head and take the gold.

320
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:37,131
You couldn't get close enough
to Steve Judd to saddle his horse.

321
00:31:37,303 --> 00:31:39,212
Well, you could.

322
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:42,719
Yes, I could, but I won't.

323
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:46,101
Unless I have to.

324
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:31,679
I hope heaven forgives us
for earning this easy money.

325
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:36,353
I seem to remember a man
hankering for some old-time activity.

326
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:40,277
I'd like to see some old-time mountains.

327
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:46,288
As I recall, they sure were
a lot easier to get around in.

328
00:32:46,455 --> 00:32:49,028
You sure complain a lot in your old age.

329
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:53,454
Well, I got something to complain about.

330
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:58,921
You're earning twice the money
for taking the same risk.

331
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:08,764
<i>Plus possessing all the other rewards
you've gathered...</i>

332
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:11,972
...during your years of loyaI service.

333
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:15,598
A bluegrass thoroughbred,
silver-mounted saddle...

334
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,397
<i>...magnificent wardrobe. I'm envious.</i>

335
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,737
What more could a man expect?
What more can a man hope for?

336
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:25,110
You forgot to mention
my two-dollar watch.

337
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:36,828
Waste of breath.

338
00:33:48,183 --> 00:33:50,555
What else could a man expect?

339
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:53,348
I got to thinking about that one time.

340
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:58,682
I keep records. When I became a lawman,
the world lost a first-class bookkeeper.

341
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,522
So to pass the time one day, I calculated
what it was worth getting shot at.

342
00:34:03,698 --> 00:34:06,070
I figured it at about $ 100 a shot.

343
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:08,235
You'd have earned quite a sum by now.

344
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:12,195
Getting hit, I figure that's worth
anywhere from 1000 on up.

345
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:15,992
- That's 3000 I know you got coming.
- Four brings it up to date.

346
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:20,416
And when you tally up all those fights
and bushwhackings and cold camps...

347
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,338
...that time in Lincoln County,
five weeks in the hospitaI...

348
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,211
<i>...six months out of work.
You add them all up, and I'd figure...</i>

349
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:32,221
...I was owed about all the gold
we could carry out of these mountains.

350
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:34,808
That's something to dream about.

351
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,808
It sure is.

352
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:48,450
Heck!

353
00:34:57,168 --> 00:35:00,169
- Mind if I keep you company on the trip?
- I don't mind.

354
00:35:00,338 --> 00:35:01,748
- I do.
- I'll second that.

355
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:05,837
My advice is turn the horse around
and ride back where you belong.

356
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:10,672
I'm not going back to my father. I'm going
to Coarsegold to marry Billy Hammond.

357
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:13,421
Why do you wanna do
a foolish thing like that?

358
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:14,846
That's my affair.

359
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:18,933
She's right, Heck. Our business
is transporting gold, not girls.

360
00:35:19,106 --> 00:35:23,234
Thanks for paying back our hospitality.
Those ham hocks and everything.

361
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:25,893
I'm a strong believer
in love and gratitude...

362
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:29,487
...but not strong enough to bring
you under these conditions.

363
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:30,939
I'll ride by myself.

364
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:34,486
We can make three miles
before it gets dark.

365
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:36,371
Right. Got to cover ground.

366
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,948
- Got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.

367
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:42,080
Too bad. This is certain
mountain-lion country.

368
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:43,369
It sure is.

369
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:46,120
Well, build a good fire.
It will scare them off.

370
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,580
You both go on ahead.

371
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,508
I couldn't sleep tonight
with the thought of Elsa by herself.

372
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,464
I'll stay with her and meet you
in Coarsegold. Go on ahead.

373
00:35:56,476 --> 00:35:59,727
Those mountain lions,
some don't scare so easy.

374
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,807
Come along, girI.

375
00:36:18,373 --> 00:36:23,368
- Do you remember old man Teaford?
- Oh, yeah.

376
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,965
All night, Logan.

377
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:30,624
Way up, Logan.

378
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:44,517
You know, the way you do your hair
looks reaI nice.

379
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:46,648
You think so?

380
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:49,476
Pa had me cut it short.

381
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:53,991
It sort of fits the shape of your head,
when you see it from the side.

382
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,193
Yeah. Like that.

383
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:00,284
You know, most girls don't know
the first thing about their hair.

384
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,874
I guess you're an authority
on what most girls do.

385
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:06,581
Well, I've studied the subject.

386
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:09,631
Not just what they do, but why.

387
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:12,339
Now, you take this getting married.

388
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,132
Do you think that's such a good idea?

389
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,632
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.

390
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:22,136
My guess is, you're doing it to get away
from your pa. To get even, maybe.

391
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:25,054
I guess your guess
is as good as anybody's.

392
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:28,565
Well, if it's wrong,
how come you ran away?

393
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,939
Because my father
doesn't want me to get married.

394
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:36,857
Always says he does.

395
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:40,202
If I can find a decent young man.

396
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,283
But nobody's decent, according to him.

397
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:49,411
You included.

398
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,629
He said you were no good.

399
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,967
He said the likes of you
don't stop at talking.

400
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,421
You know, he has a point there.

401
00:38:03,477 --> 00:38:05,137
Don't move!

402
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:07,146
Don't move, Elsa.

403
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,872
No! Heck, no! Let me go! No! No!

404
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:37,794
Let me go!

405
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:56,320
My, oh, my.

406
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,115
When I questioned you about him...

407
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,292
<i>...I should've gone more
into the subject of character.</i>

408
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,414
I hope that's a mistake
I won't live to regret.

409
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:15,914
Good fight. I enjoyed it.

410
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,512
That old man?

411
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:32,351
That old man is about half rough.

412
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:36,059
- You learned a lesson, didn't you?
- I surely did.

413
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:37,860
Got room for another?

414
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:40,069
Let her fly.

415
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,991
We're not here for romance.
Understand me, son?

416
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:53,828
Yes, sir.

417
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,602
I hope Mr. Judd didn't hurt you too bad.

418
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:24,359
- I guess it's kind of my fault.
- What do you mean, "kind of"?

419
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:27,737
I acted silly. I'm sorry.

420
00:40:27,912 --> 00:40:29,572
I do like you, Heck.

421
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:33,581
Save the sugar talk for your Billy boy.
I don't need it.

422
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:38,294
What you need's the kind of girI who'd go
with you to San Francisco or Denver.

423
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:39,958
And there's plenty of them.

424
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:43,502
I changed my mind.
You got just what you deserve!

425
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:48,965
You got something to say?

426
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:53,139
No, I think she about covered everything.

427
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,447
Lovely place. A beauty spot of nature.

428
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:13,706
A Garden of Eden for the sore in heart
and short of cash.

429
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:16,626
We didn't come here
to enjoy the scenery.

430
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:36,052
The High Sierra Crochet
and Garden Society...

431
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,519
...seem to be having
their weekly meeting.

432
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:44,062
When we get located, pass the word that
we're in camp and ready for business.

433
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:48,946
And you, find out where the Hammond
claim is and take her there.

434
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:50,149
Why me?

435
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:53,826
Because Steve and I
are gonna be busy collecting gold.

436
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,413
Not too late to change your mind.

437
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:07,251
I came to Coarsegold to be married.
And that's what I'm gonna be. Married.

438
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:11,295
- Well, good luck, then.
- All the happiness in the world.

439
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:19,186
Welcome to Coarsegold.

440
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:21,728
This seems to be the place to find it.

441
00:42:24,653 --> 00:42:26,562
You might be in for a big surprise.

442
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:29,490
How do you know Billy boy
still wants to marry you?

443
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:33,027
- What do you care?
- I don't.

444
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:00,891
This the Hammond claim?

445
00:43:01,064 --> 00:43:04,397
- Who wants to know?
- I do. I'm looking for Billy Hammond.

446
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:06,894
You found him.

447
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,694
Billy!

448
00:43:09,906 --> 00:43:11,649
Howdy, Elsa!

449
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:13,734
I can't believe it, honey.

450
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:18,830
Looks like the girI he's been
going down the mountain to see.

451
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:23,080
I'll say one thing,
she's sure worth the trip.

452
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:25,745
Wish I'd got there first.

453
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:28,248
Looks like a warm one.

454
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:33,086
- Hey, where's your pa at?
- Back home.

455
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:37,012
You mean you run off and come
all the way up here just to see me?

456
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,345
See you?

457
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:43,104
I brought my mother's wedding dress.

458
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:45,265
- If you still want to.
- If I want to?

459
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:48,015
If he don't, you got four others
to choose from.

460
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:51,361
Sweet thing like you
ought to have the pick of the litter.

461
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:54,485
- No rush about making up your mind.
- Don't listen.

462
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,114
We're gonna get married tonight.

463
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:00,618
I guess that will be all, Mr. Longtree.

464
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,416
By the way...

465
00:44:06,212 --> 00:44:08,833
...just who is Mr. Longtree?

466
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:11,129
I rode up with him from the farm.

467
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:19,474
- That's a couple of days on the traiI.
- That's right. Two days, two nights.

468
00:44:19,642 --> 00:44:21,469
A couple of nights.

469
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:24,479
A couple of nights on the traiI.

470
00:44:26,857 --> 00:44:28,482
Billy!

471
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:32,318
There were two other men with us
from the bank in town.

472
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:37,234
Besides, Mr. Longtree
was a perfect gentleman.

473
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,402
How come? Something wrong with him?

474
00:44:39,578 --> 00:44:45,663
Well, now, I don't think I ever met
a perfect gentleman before, Mr. Longtree.

475
00:44:56,261 --> 00:45:00,508
You come back and see us reaI
soon now, you hear, Mr. Longtree?

476
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:20,949
Jimmy, Sylvus, Elder, come on down
here. I want you to meet my woman.

477
00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:23,573
Come on.

478
00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:27,206
Elsa, honey, this is Jimmy.
He's the baby of the family.

479
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:31,209
And that's Sylvus. He's been doing
our cooking, as you can see.

480
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,045
And the one on the end is Elder.
He's the head of the clan.

481
00:45:35,217 --> 00:45:40,970
I want you to meet my favorite brother.
Henry! Get down here now! Come on.

482
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:44,224
Henry's sort of our banker,
you might say.

483
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:47,141
come on, honey, I'll show you my tent.

484
00:46:33,274 --> 00:46:36,026
It looks like you've got
a pretty good claim.

485
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:41,314
It's a gold mine. Why don't
you come over and take a look.

486
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:43,614
You're invited too.

487
00:46:53,336 --> 00:46:55,375
- Find Billy Hammond?
- Yeah.

488
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,827
What's he like?

489
00:46:57,006 --> 00:47:00,505
What difference does it make?
She wanted him, now she's got him.

490
00:47:00,676 --> 00:47:01,874
I don't want a shave.

491
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:05,552
Well, Jimmy, you're gonna get shaved
whether you want to or not.

492
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:09,258
You've been running around
with that peach fuzz long enough.

493
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:13,100
We want that girI to know
she's marrying into a family of men.

494
00:47:16,484 --> 00:47:18,275
Hey, Billy.

495
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,320
Thank you, Sylvus.

496
00:47:26,285 --> 00:47:28,076
Now hauI it.

497
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,781
What's that for?

498
00:47:29,955 --> 00:47:31,829
You're leaving.

499
00:47:35,169 --> 00:47:38,917
I see no sense in moving out
just because you're honeymooning.

500
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:43,253
I don't have time to explain it to you,
brother. Just get out.

501
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,054
I ain't going.

502
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,145
You just did.

503
00:48:02,863 --> 00:48:04,902
Takes care of him.

504
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:13,120
- I gotta clean up in here.
- Plenty of time for that later.

505
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,537
- No. I wanna do it now.
- No, you don't.

506
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:22,622
- But the place is filthy.
- It'll wait. It'll wait.

507
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,922
Let go, Billy.

508
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:28,504
- Billy, let me go!
- All right.

509
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,217
Calm down.

510
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:35,803
Come on, honey.

511
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:38,889
See you later.

512
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:45,687
If you need any help...

513
00:48:45,864 --> 00:48:49,280
...fastening up your wedding dress,
you just holler, you hear?

514
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:51,325
I'll manage.

515
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,869
First drink is best, east or west.

516
00:48:58,251 --> 00:49:01,336
- Let him go. Turn him loose.
- There we go.

517
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:03,663
Jimmy, we're gonna make
a man of you now.

518
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,500
Say, Henry.

519
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:09,840
I've been wanting to ask you something.
Something's been on my mind.

520
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,800
Was you planning to bathe
for the wedding?

521
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:14,766
No, sir.

522
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:19,603
You ain't gonna clean up
for your brother's wedding?

523
00:49:20,982 --> 00:49:22,856
No, sir, I ain't.

524
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,560
I didn't wash when cousin
got wed back home.

525
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:31,569
That bride didn't seem to mind none.
Did she, Billy?

526
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:35,318
Now there'll be none of that.

527
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:37,782
None of what?

528
00:49:43,504 --> 00:49:46,078
You know something, Sylvus?

529
00:49:46,257 --> 00:49:49,591
Billy is getting small-minded
about that woman.

530
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:51,089
And a might feisty.

531
00:49:51,262 --> 00:49:54,133
A few drinks under his belt,
he'll change his mind.

532
00:49:54,307 --> 00:49:57,308
Now, liquor always did have
a softening effect on Billy.

533
00:49:57,477 --> 00:50:00,098
I hate to get married
with one of my brothers...

534
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:02,643
...smelling bad enough to gag a dog.

535
00:50:02,815 --> 00:50:04,808
Yeah, that so?

536
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:09,445
You wouldn't want that sweet thing to
think we're less than quality, would you?

537
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:12,527
The only thing I know
is that after tonight...

538
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,903
<i>...she ain't gonna be able
to think enough about me.</i>

539
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:26,460
Get him in there.

540
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:34,673
All right, let him up.

541
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:39,559
- Henry. Henry.
- Henry.

542
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:41,470
- Come on now, Henry.
- Easy now.

543
00:50:41,645 --> 00:50:44,350
- We're just funning you, Henry.
- Come on, Henry.

544
00:50:44,523 --> 00:50:45,686
- Easy.
- Come on, Henry.

545
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:48,431
Put the knife up now.
You're gonna cut yourself.

546
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:50,734
Is that a smile I see on his face?

547
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,941
Easy now, Henry.

548
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:12,768
Come on, boys.

549
00:52:30,295 --> 00:52:32,371
Drink to the bride!

550
00:52:36,468 --> 00:52:38,460
Let's have a drink.

551
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:51,936
Stand up, judge. Here comes the bride.

552
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:54,943
Come on. Steady now.

553
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,656
Here she is, folks, my bride-to-be.
Elsa, this here's Judge Tolliver.

554
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,577
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
my dear.

555
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:13,207
And that there's Kate.
She's your bridesmaid.

556
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:15,336
Welcome to Kate's Place, honey.

557
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:21,591
And these ladies over here
are Sam and Rose and Belle and Candy.

558
00:53:21,762 --> 00:53:25,511
- We're your flower girls, honey.
- You're beautifuI, girls. BeautifuI.

559
00:53:25,683 --> 00:53:27,177
Aren't they beautifuI, Elsa?

560
00:53:31,856 --> 00:53:34,062
Let her roll, Charlie!

561
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:09,924
Drinks on the house!

562
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:17,019
You come on over and sit down, honey.
You must be tired. Poor baby.

563
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:20,941
We'll all of us have a little drinkie
before the formalities.

564
00:54:24,742 --> 00:54:28,786
Now, you take this. Don't be afraid.
It'll do you good.

565
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:30,863
Cheers, Elsa.

566
00:54:44,302 --> 00:54:45,845
Heck.

567
00:54:47,681 --> 00:54:51,429
Eleven thousand,
four hundred and eighty-six.

568
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:54,009
That's a far cry
from a quarter of a million.

569
00:54:54,187 --> 00:54:56,263
Fortunes of war.

570
00:54:57,983 --> 00:54:59,525
Hardly worth it.

571
00:54:59,693 --> 00:55:02,480
All depends on where you stand.

572
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:05,565
I guess that's right.

573
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:10,118
To a poor man, 11,000
is just as far away as 250,000.

574
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:17,835
- Where are you going?
- Out for some fresh air. Any objections?

575
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:23,882
We're gathered here in the high mountains
in the presence of this august company...

576
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:29,213
...to join this man and this woman
in matrimony.

577
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:34,929
Now, I'm not a man of the cloth,
and this is not a religious ceremony.

578
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:37,510
It's a civiI marriage.

579
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:42,315
But it's not to be entered
into unadvisedly...

580
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:45,154
...but reverently and soberly.

581
00:55:45,738 --> 00:55:50,400
A good marriage has a kind
of simple glory about it.

582
00:55:50,576 --> 00:55:55,535
A good marriage is like a rare animaI.
It's hard to find.

583
00:55:55,707 --> 00:55:58,328
It's almost impossible to keep.

584
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,535
You see, people change.

585
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:05,247
That's important for you to know
at the beginning.

586
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:06,670
People change.

587
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:13,014
The glory of a good marriage
don't come at the beginning.

588
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,682
It comes later on.

589
00:56:17,186 --> 00:56:19,095
It's hard work.

590
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:24,436
Billy, do you take this woman
to be your lawfuI-wedded wife...

591
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,062
- ... until God, by death, shall separate you?
- I do.

592
00:56:29,615 --> 00:56:31,275
And do-?

593
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,695
What's your name again?

594
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:35,114
Elsa Knudsen.

595
00:56:35,288 --> 00:56:39,617
Do you, Elsa, promise to take this man
to be your lawfuI-wedded husband...

596
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:41,998
...until death does separate you?

597
00:56:43,963 --> 00:56:45,042
I do.

598
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:50,258
Do you have a ring?

599
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:58,223
Then, by the authority vested in me,
I hereby pronounce you man and wife.

600
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:07,353
All right, girls, change your clothes.

601
00:57:16,912 --> 00:57:19,450
Henry! Henry, Henry!

602
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,954
No, no. Sylvus, Sylvus.
Now that's enough, Sylvus.

603
00:57:44,648 --> 00:57:47,768
Hey, bartender, pour a little more.

604
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:52,110
No use standing here
tormenting yourself, son.

605
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:54,446
come on, I'll buy you a drink.

606
00:57:54,616 --> 00:57:55,814
What a party!

607
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:07,494
Come on, Billy. Come on, get over there
and get acquainted around.

608
00:58:16,638 --> 00:58:19,211
Let me in there. Let me in there.

609
00:58:21,393 --> 00:58:24,144
- Have fun, honey.
- Billy!

610
00:58:26,648 --> 00:58:27,846
Billy!

611
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:32,312
come on, now. It's my turn, Sylvus.

612
00:58:32,779 --> 00:58:34,855
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, wait.

613
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:36,360
You had your turn.

614
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:39,736
It looks like Jimmy's making a man
out of himself.

615
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:45,579
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, don't be like that, Sylvus.

616
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:47,781
Oh, come on now.

617
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:51,543
Now, Sylvus, we got a nice party.
Why don't you behave yourself.

618
00:58:51,714 --> 00:58:53,043
You can't hit my brother!

619
00:58:58,012 --> 00:58:59,804
Don't leave me.

620
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:05,176
I wish I'd known more
about those brothers.

621
00:59:05,353 --> 00:59:07,013
It's too late now.

622
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,600
- She's married.
- Glad they didn't invite me.

623
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:13,182
I always cry at weddings.

624
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:17,738
The more I am around you, the more
I can do without your sense of humor.

625
00:59:17,907 --> 00:59:20,445
Come on, break it up!
Boys, get over there!

626
00:59:20,618 --> 00:59:23,654
Now I said, break it up,
and I mean it. Get over there.

627
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,830
Come on, Sylvus, get over here
and behave yourself.

628
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:28,791
Get over there!

629
00:59:33,714 --> 00:59:36,086
- No, Billy.
- Come on.

630
00:59:36,384 --> 00:59:37,878
No.

631
00:59:40,888 --> 00:59:43,213
Well, now, get on in there!

632
00:59:53,442 --> 00:59:55,814
Easy now, Elsa.

633
00:59:56,445 --> 00:59:58,983
- Listen, Elsa, you come here!
- No, Billy!

634
00:59:59,156 --> 01:00:03,070
No, Billy! No! Not here!

635
01:00:03,577 --> 01:00:05,237
No, Billy!

636
01:00:05,412 --> 01:00:08,413
Now, you straighten out,
you hear me?

637
01:00:23,055 --> 01:00:25,012
Where's Billy?

638
01:00:28,394 --> 01:00:30,102
I've got some prying brothers.

639
01:00:47,454 --> 01:00:49,411
You stay here.

640
01:00:50,624 --> 01:00:52,830
She's mine. She's mine. Let go, Henry.

641
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:55,788
- Elsa!
- Henry, turn loose of me!

642
01:00:55,962 --> 01:00:58,121
I'm gonna get you.

643
01:00:59,508 --> 01:01:02,295
- Come back, Elsa. Come back.
- Come back, girI.

644
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:07,924
Come on, get your bride.
Billy, get your bride.

645
01:01:16,483 --> 01:01:18,060
Hold it!

646
01:01:21,154 --> 01:01:23,111
Let her go.

647
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:36,959
- Where are you going with my wife?
- She'll stay with us.

648
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:41,340
- I'm taking her to her father tomorrow.
- Like hell she will.

649
01:01:46,638 --> 01:01:50,885
- You can't take a wife from her husband.
- Clear case of breaking and entering.

650
01:01:52,435 --> 01:01:57,062
- Elsa's legally married to Billy. Right?
- I now pronounce you man and wife.

651
01:01:57,774 --> 01:02:00,894
- And don't you forget it.
- Go along, Elsa.

652
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:03,527
Heck.

653
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:10,574
You're not leaving this camp with her.
I'll promise you that.

654
01:02:21,464 --> 01:02:22,875
Go home, Billy.

655
01:02:24,592 --> 01:02:27,048
What happened? You all right, Billy?

656
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,470
Where is she? Where is she?
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

657
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,716
- Billy!
- Where'd he go with her?

658
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:36,343
- Come on.
- Why'd you let him get away with her?

659
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:46,319
The marriage didn't work.
We have to take her to her father.

660
01:02:46,489 --> 01:02:50,866
- We've got our hands full already.
- I don't like it any better than you do.

661
01:03:01,086 --> 01:03:02,913
Too big, huh?

662
01:03:22,107 --> 01:03:23,602
What are they doing there?

663
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:27,690
We're willing to abide
by the court's decision if you are.

664
01:03:30,658 --> 01:03:31,902
We'll abide.

665
01:03:32,618 --> 01:03:34,610
Don't be scared.

666
01:03:48,634 --> 01:03:50,959
- What's wrong?
- Billy Hammond wants Elsa.

667
01:03:51,136 --> 01:03:53,461
They appointed a miners' court
to decide it.

668
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:56,308
- Miners' court?
- That's the law, places like this.

669
01:03:56,475 --> 01:03:58,432
- Who says?
- They do.

670
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:01,437
And there's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

671
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:05,602
Billy's very sorry. Swears it
won't happen again. I believe him.

672
01:04:05,776 --> 01:04:08,812
- I wouldn't believe Billy-
- I don't wanna go back.

673
01:04:08,987 --> 01:04:11,560
You were legally married
of your own free will.

674
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:15,026
Please. You can't let him
take me back. You can't.

675
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:18,119
But whatever they decide,
that will have to be it.

676
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:22,368
That don't have to be it. She's not
going with him. She stays with us.

677
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:25,413
She stays here!
We're packing gold, not petticoats.

678
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:28,542
If she stays, I stay.

679
01:04:33,053 --> 01:04:35,544
Well, let's hope the court
lets her go with us.

680
01:04:35,722 --> 01:04:38,509
Otherwise, we'll be a little short-handed.

681
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:56,823
All right, gentlemen, we can proceed.

682
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:01,988
In the first place, I married this gaI here
last night, up on the hill in Kate's Place.

683
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:05,201
- You saw Judge-
- Where can I find Judge Tolliver?

684
01:05:05,376 --> 01:05:09,326
- At the end of the hall, mister.
- He married us legaI and proper.

685
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:31,893
Easy. Sit up.

686
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,777
A little more.

687
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,499
Thank you, sir.

688
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,178
What can I do for you?

689
01:05:58,346 --> 01:06:00,753
Clear up a little technicality,
if you will.

690
01:06:00,931 --> 01:06:03,422
About that marriage last night.

691
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:07,349
They're holding a miners' court.
They'll wanna know if it was legaI.

692
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:10,810
- Of course it was legaI.
- Well, I believe that.

693
01:06:10,983 --> 01:06:14,269
But the court may want proof,
in the form of a license.

694
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:16,105
You got one?

695
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:32,914
Signed by the governor of California.

696
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:37,133
Yes, sir, there's no question at all
about the legality of this document.

697
01:06:37,885 --> 01:06:40,554
<i>Now, when you testify
before that miners' court...</i>

698
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:42,595
<i>...I'm gonna ask you one question:</i>

699
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:46,098
"Do you possess a license
to marry people in california?"

700
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:50,052
And you're gonna answer, "No. "
Am I clear?

701
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:54,314
- That's a lie.
- No, it isn't. You don't possess it. I do.

702
01:06:54,484 --> 01:06:56,442
- Now, see here-
- Listen to me!

703
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,150
You're gonna do as you're told.
Understand?

704
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:06,615
Now, do you recall the question
I'm gonna ask?

705
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:09,448
And what do you answer?

706
01:07:09,624 --> 01:07:11,119
No.

707
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:13,494
Very good.

708
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,545
Let's go.

709
01:08:12,604 --> 01:08:15,770
According to the law,
she's still married to Billy Hammond.

710
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,727
You and the law.
She can get it nullified.

711
01:08:18,902 --> 01:08:21,571
Will that satisfy
your ironbound code of ethics?

712
01:08:21,738 --> 01:08:24,904
My code satisfies pretty easy, partner.

713
01:08:25,074 --> 01:08:28,823
Would it surprise you to know
that I was once a lawbreaker?

714
01:08:28,995 --> 01:08:32,411
Well, bless my stars.

715
01:08:32,582 --> 01:08:37,623
About the age of that boy back there.
Skinny as a snake and just about as mean.

716
01:08:37,795 --> 01:08:39,871
Ran with the Hole-in-the-Wall bunch.

717
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:43,879
Gun-happy, looking for trouble
or a pretty ankle.

718
01:08:44,135 --> 01:08:46,590
Had the world by the taiI,
so to speak.

719
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:49,682
Then one night,
PauI Staniford picked me up.

720
01:08:49,849 --> 01:08:51,925
He was sheriff of Madera County then.

721
01:08:52,101 --> 01:08:56,312
There'd been a fight, and I was drunk.
Sicker than a fat dog.

722
01:08:56,606 --> 01:08:59,441
He dried me out in jaiI,
and then we went out back...

723
01:08:59,608 --> 01:09:03,227
...and he proceeded to kick
the bitter hell right out of me.

724
01:09:03,446 --> 01:09:05,070
That took some doing.

725
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:08,489
Not much. You see,
he was right, I was wrong.

726
01:09:08,659 --> 01:09:10,568
That makes the difference.

727
01:09:10,744 --> 01:09:12,404
Who says so?

728
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:15,497
Nobody. That's something
you just know.

729
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:19,995
Anyhow, when I was able to walk again,
I realized I'd learned a lesson from him.

730
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:22,170
The value of self-respect.

731
01:09:22,339 --> 01:09:24,415
What's that worth on the open market?

732
01:09:24,592 --> 01:09:28,541
Nothing to some people,
but a great deaI to me.

733
01:09:28,804 --> 01:09:30,298
But I lost it.

734
01:09:30,472 --> 01:09:34,636
These last years, the only work
I was able to get was places like Kate's.

735
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,728
Bartender, stick man, bouncer,
what have you.

736
01:09:37,896 --> 01:09:40,138
Not much to brag on.

737
01:09:40,566 --> 01:09:43,401
Now I'm getting back
a little respect for myself.

738
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:47,981
I intend to keep it with the help of you
and that boy back there.

739
01:09:48,824 --> 01:09:51,991
- Good to be working again, GiI.
- Yeah.

740
01:09:52,452 --> 01:09:55,489
You know what's on the back
of a poor man when he dies?

741
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:57,158
The clothes of pride.

742
01:09:57,708 --> 01:10:02,500
And they're not a bit warmer to him dead
than they were when he was alive.

743
01:10:05,674 --> 01:10:07,750
Is that all you want, Steve?

744
01:10:10,596 --> 01:10:14,676
AII I want is to enter my house justified.

745
01:10:22,524 --> 01:10:24,267
Thank you.

746
01:10:25,026 --> 01:10:27,731
Will you stay in town
when we get back?

747
01:10:29,948 --> 01:10:32,521
I'm not just certain. Why?

748
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:48,710
You're right, kid. I've been wasting
my breath. Tonight we move.

749
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:52,046
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

750
01:10:52,387 --> 01:10:55,092
I started out thinking
he was an old mossback...

751
01:10:55,265 --> 01:10:58,634
...but I changed my mind.
Kind of hate to turn against him.

752
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:00,637
Are you with me or not?

753
01:11:00,812 --> 01:11:03,564
- What will happen to Elsa?
- He'll deliver her.

754
01:11:03,732 --> 01:11:07,812
The thing for you to remember
is that we made a deaI.

755
01:11:08,236 --> 01:11:09,896
Yes, sir.

756
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:03,327
It all pointed this way.

757
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:07,960
All that talk about old Doc Franklin,
ungratefuI citizens.

758
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:12,126
- What we had coming but never got paid.
- It's the truth, isn't it, Steve?

759
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:16,961
I knew in my bones what you were
aiming for, but I wouldn't believe it.

760
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:19,463
I kept telling myself
you were a good man.

761
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:23,808
- You were my friend.
- This is bank money, not yours.

762
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:26,266
And what they don't know
won't hurt them.

763
01:12:26,438 --> 01:12:28,727
Not them. Only me!

764
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:36,028
Take off your gun belt
and toss it over here.

765
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,288
What are you gonna do?

766
01:12:55,843 --> 01:12:59,425
You always fancied yourself
faster than me.

767
01:13:00,055 --> 01:13:02,297
Go ahead, draw.

768
01:13:02,683 --> 01:13:04,759
Draw, you damned tinhorn!

769
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:19,399
That was your second mistake...

770
01:13:19,574 --> 01:13:22,611
...and the last chance
you'll ever get from me.

771
01:13:23,036 --> 01:13:26,203
I'm gonna put you behind bars, GiI.

772
01:13:26,373 --> 01:13:28,365
You'll play hell getting it done.

773
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,032
Move!

774
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:25,347
My, oh, my, will you look who's here.

775
01:14:25,515 --> 01:14:30,640
Howdy. You made pure fools out of us,
stealing that license from Tolliver.

776
01:14:30,812 --> 01:14:33,896
The judge says there's another one
on file in Sacramento.

777
01:14:34,065 --> 01:14:37,648
That means she's still my wife.
come on, honey, let's go home.

778
01:14:37,819 --> 01:14:39,811
She stays with us.

779
01:14:40,363 --> 01:14:42,984
Looks to me like you been
having some trouble.

780
01:14:43,157 --> 01:14:47,784
Looks to me like somebody got
their finger caught in the cookie jar.

781
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:51,536
You're short-handed, old-timer,
but she's all we want.

782
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,954
All we want,
provided we get her now.

783
01:14:55,128 --> 01:14:57,963
- You heard me.
- We'll get her, sooner or later.

784
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:59,506
Like hell you will!

785
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:03,838
You better cut yourself a switch,
Mr. Longtree.

786
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:06,929
I don't think you
could handle me barehanded.

787
01:15:07,098 --> 01:15:10,716
You all are gonna get yourself
a chance to try, directly.

788
01:15:11,477 --> 01:15:13,137
Come on.

789
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:23,486
I have your word you'll return
your gun when this is over?

790
01:15:23,656 --> 01:15:25,814
Yes, sir, I reckon you do.

791
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:32,279
- I'll go along.
- You bet you'll go along.

792
01:15:32,456 --> 01:15:34,496
- We're moving into the rocks.
- Steve!

793
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:37,371
Shut up! Move!

794
01:15:38,128 --> 01:15:40,002
Move out!

795
01:16:29,638 --> 01:16:31,714
You're really showing your age.

796
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:36,386
Back in the old days, you'd have checked
those rifles before we left camp.

797
01:16:40,732 --> 01:16:43,057
I'll get around behind them.

798
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,902
Don't waste your time.
They're too far away.

799
01:16:54,246 --> 01:16:57,780
He's going around behind us.
Cut me loose and give me a gun.

800
01:16:57,999 --> 01:17:00,241
I'll get a rifle for you.

801
01:17:03,213 --> 01:17:05,040
Start shooting.

802
01:17:36,996 --> 01:17:38,241
Sylvus!

803
01:17:38,706 --> 01:17:39,869
Sylvus!

804
01:18:12,865 --> 01:18:17,194
- He was carrying a rifle.
- Let's get out of here!

805
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:36,591
- Looks like they got Sylvus.
- I know that. come on! We're getting out.

806
01:18:36,764 --> 01:18:40,631
You got two brothers dead,
you talk about running?

807
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:42,185
Come on!

808
01:19:21,058 --> 01:19:23,134
I wonder where those other three went.

809
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:26,893
- I hope they're not still following us.
- Calm your fears, honey.

810
01:19:27,064 --> 01:19:30,480
My guess is, they gave up
and went back to Coarsegold.

811
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:34,236
Assuming that's so,
I'll have your gun back.

812
01:19:42,287 --> 01:19:43,995
Do you hear me, boy?

813
01:19:54,925 --> 01:19:58,210
I'm sorry, Mr. Judd.
I guess I was showing off.

814
01:20:02,224 --> 01:20:05,390
- What happens when we get to town?
- It's up to the sheriff.

815
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:09,688
He's turning us in.
You know that. So do I.

816
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:18,734
- Ever hear of Folsom Prison, Heck?
- No.

817
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:20,698
Well, it's solid rock.

818
01:20:20,867 --> 01:20:23,440
<i>During the years we spend there
we'll discuss...</i>

819
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:26,786
...the events of the past few minutes
at great length.

820
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:31,203
And by the time you get out, you won't
like him any better than I do now...

821
01:20:31,377 --> 01:20:34,129
<i>...which isn't one hell of a lot.
Where do I sleep?</i>

822
01:20:34,672 --> 01:20:38,088
Up there. I don't wanna see you
till breakfast.

823
01:20:45,266 --> 01:20:46,511
Cut me loose, Steve.

824
01:20:48,394 --> 01:20:49,972
Why?

825
01:20:52,607 --> 01:20:54,813
Because I don't sleep so good anymore.

826
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:12,668
- Good night.
- Good night.

827
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:23,296
<i>My father says
there's only right and wrong...</i>

828
01:21:23,721 --> 01:21:25,797
...good and eviI.

829
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:28,340
Nothing in between.

830
01:21:29,477 --> 01:21:34,518
- It isn't that simple, is it?
- No, it isn't. It should be, but it isn't.

831
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,979
What's gonna happen to him?

832
01:21:37,318 --> 01:21:41,980
The boy? I'll testify for him.
They shouldn't be too hard.

833
01:21:42,782 --> 01:21:45,403
Will you testify for Mr. Westrum?

834
01:21:46,243 --> 01:21:49,328
- No, I won't.
- Why?

835
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,866
Because he was my friend.

836
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,865
- How come he don't tie us up?
- What for?

837
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,036
No place to go.

838
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:01,044
He's got the horses,
and he's got the guns.

839
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:04,751
And it wouldn't take long
for Steve Judd to find us.

840
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,592
Wait a minute, kid.
I just had a thought.

841
01:22:07,765 --> 01:22:11,928
Well, keep it to yourself.
I'm fed up with you and your ideas.

842
01:22:19,276 --> 01:22:21,233
That's all right.

843
01:22:24,865 --> 01:22:26,573
That's all right.

844
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:41,580
- Morning.
- Morning.

845
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:44,498
- Where's GiI?
- Gone.

846
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:48,137
Why didn't you go with him?

847
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,465
Because I didn't see any future
in our partnership.

848
01:23:44,861 --> 01:23:46,485
Come on.

849
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,563
Get up there!

850
01:24:19,312 --> 01:24:21,185
You wait here.

851
01:24:21,647 --> 01:24:24,352
I'll go down and take a look around.

852
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:44,752
- The old gent's taking quite a chance.
- I don't think so.

853
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,877
Neither does he.

854
01:24:48,799 --> 01:24:51,883
I never figured
it would turn out this way.

855
01:24:53,095 --> 01:24:57,638
chances are I'll be locked up for a while.
I've got no call to bring it up.

856
01:24:57,808 --> 01:25:00,299
- But maybe when I get out-
- I'll be there.

857
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:23,954
I saw your father. Everything's all right.

858
01:26:39,325 --> 01:26:41,152
What are you doing?

859
01:27:16,737 --> 01:27:19,608
- That's strange.
- What?

860
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:23,033
He goes to her grave every day
but always in the morning.

861
01:27:23,202 --> 01:27:24,696
Never in the afternoon.

862
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:29,782
We're going to the ditch.

863
01:27:29,959 --> 01:27:31,038
Now!

864
01:27:48,811 --> 01:27:51,053
I walked right into it.

865
01:27:52,898 --> 01:27:55,224
I'm gonna try for the corraI.

866
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:42,988
I got him.

867
01:29:01,299 --> 01:29:03,292
Well, where's the rifle?

868
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,215
On the horse.

869
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:11,969
Bad?

870
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:13,804
Not yet.

871
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,689
Partner, what do you think?

872
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:27,157
Let's meet them head-on, halfway,
just like always.

873
01:29:27,325 --> 01:29:29,733
My sentiments exactly.

874
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:32,995
- You, Hammonds!
- What do you want, old man?

875
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:36,493
He wants a shoveI and six feet of dirt.

876
01:29:36,668 --> 01:29:38,874
You redneck peckerwoods.

877
01:29:39,045 --> 01:29:42,544
You're too chicken-gutted
to finish this thing out in the open.

878
01:29:47,887 --> 01:29:50,674
Two old men
against all three of you boys.

879
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:55,012
And if them odds ain't enough for you
damned dry-gulching Southern trash...

880
01:29:55,186 --> 01:29:59,100
<i>- ... we'll send out the girI.
- We're coming!</i>

881
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:01,515
- You hear me, Henry?
- Yeah, I hear you.

882
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:04,018
You don't have to ask me twice!

883
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:06,687
Now, you hold on, Billy.

884
01:30:06,864 --> 01:30:11,822
- We'll catch them when they raise up.
- Ain't you got no sense of family honor?

885
01:31:15,099 --> 01:31:16,925
Start the ball, old man.

886
01:31:49,007 --> 01:31:51,130
How'd we figure?

887
01:31:51,343 --> 01:31:54,297
- A thousand dollars a shot?
- Yeah.

888
01:31:55,305 --> 01:31:58,425
Those boys sure made me
a lot of money.

889
01:32:01,394 --> 01:32:03,968
They put them all in one spot.

890
01:32:09,236 --> 01:32:12,071
I don't want them to see this.

891
01:32:13,615 --> 01:32:15,738
I'll go it alone.

892
01:32:26,294 --> 01:32:28,666
Don't worry about anything.

893
01:32:29,422 --> 01:32:32,874
I'll take care of it,
just like you would have.

894
01:32:34,803 --> 01:32:37,044
Hell, I know that.

895
01:32:37,222 --> 01:32:39,380
I always did.

896
01:32:40,016 --> 01:32:43,183
You just forgot it for a while, that's all.

897
01:32:46,231 --> 01:32:48,686
So long, partner.

898
01:32:58,034 --> 01:32:59,991
I'll see you later.
