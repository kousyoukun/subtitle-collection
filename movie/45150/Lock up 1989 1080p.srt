1
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:18,957
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

2
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,854
I'm looking for a mechanic.
Anybody here fit that description?

3
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:27,358
I might be able to help you.
What do you need?

4
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:32,051
I need it fixed right away. I need
someone who knows what they're doing.

5
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,887
I'm not that busy.
So, what's the problem?

6
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:39,890
I'm not sure. Maybe you ought to
get under the hood and check it out.

7
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,224
Yeah, maybe I better.

8
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:53,717
Looks okay from here.

9
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:56,588
Great customer service.

10
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:01,085
Little bit of cleaning,
little bit of paint...

11
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:03,954
... this place will be ready
for business.

12
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:07,151
About time for me to play
in the Super Bowl.

13
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:10,352
Those guys are gonna take you apart.

14
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:16,224
Okay, we're gonna do it this time!
Ready?

15
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:20,360
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah!

16
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,155
Hike!

17
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:32,261
To the left. You can do it. Cut back.

18
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:38,086
Here it comes.

19
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,961
All right!

20
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:51,427
Okay, suckers walk. Suckers walk.

21
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:55,924
Hey. Hey, suckers walk.
Go on. Suckers walk. Come on.

22
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:58,220
Suckers walk!

23
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:05,795
- Hey, Frankie, what's that mean?
- It means everything's okay.

24
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,489
So how do you think I did?

25
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:11,321
Pretty good with the sixth graders.

26
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:15,359
You really know how to make a guy
feel great, you know that?

27
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,953
What's the matter?
We don't look too happy today?

28
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,852
I'm missing you already.

29
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,618
Pretty soon you'll be so sick
of seeing me...

30
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:29,159
... you'll pray to have some time
on your own. You know that?

31
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:32,261
- I don't believe you.
- Yeah, believe it.

32
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,859
Now that's Italian.

33
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:43,124
- I gotta go.
- No. No.

34
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,920
- I gotta go. Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

35
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:51,095
So I'm not so good against 10-year-olds?
I should try a different sport?

36
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,455
Yeah, golf.

37
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,357
- Golf?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,256
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

39
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,621
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

40
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:07,855
You're lucky I have a sense of humour.
I would take that personal.

41
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,423
Time to go to work.

42
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:37,856
- All right, be good.
- Bye.

43
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,324
Wait a minute.

44
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:44,825
I got something for you.

45
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,260
What's this?

46
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,952
It's supposed to bring you luck.

47
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:54,754
It's nice.

48
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,854
Thanks.

49
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,721
I could use it.

50
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,021
- How'd it go, Frank? Good furlough?
- The best.

51
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:24,321
- Did you see that game?
- I have to admit, I missed it.

52
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,156
- It was awesome.
- Was it?

53
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:29,818
- Yes. You missed a good one.
- I missed a good one?

54
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,860
- I had more fun than you this weekend.
- I bet you did.

55
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,321
Here you go, Roger.

56
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,156
- How's the diesel running, Jimmy?
- Forget it. It stops, it stalls.

57
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:47,488
- It don't go.
- You got water in the fuel line.

58
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:49,789
Open your mouth.

59
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:52,089
- You sure?
- I'd bet time on it.

60
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:53,957
- Take it off.
- All right.

61
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:59,127
I'll see you later, Jimmy.

62
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:03,493
- I'll give you more starch next time.
- Yeah, do that.

63
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:06,959
Say hi to the wife.
How you doing there, man?

64
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:09,426
Frank! What'd you bring me?

65
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:11,564
Here you go. Go kill yourself.

66
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:15,221
- I thought you'd bring me a girl.
- I had one...

67
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:18,364
... but the guards decided to keep her.

68
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,258
I can't depend on you.
Let me ask you something else.

69
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:24,828
- Did you go see the garage?
- It's beautiful.

70
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:29,490
- No garage I ever stuck up was beautiful.
- This one is.

71
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:34,130
Can I tell you something?
I'm getting out soon. I don't come cheap.

72
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:37,819
But you know I know my way
around cars. You need help, call me.

73
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:42,259
- I fix them, I don't steal them.
- I was framed.

74
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:44,630
What? I was framed.

75
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:15,658
- What is this, Jimmy?
- I don't know, but it's official.

76
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,290
Crack 210.

77
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:43,156
- On your feet, Leone.
- What do you want?

78
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,991
- Take him.
- What are you doing here?

79
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:49,756
- You're being transferred.
- Transferred where?

80
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,932
- That's not necessary.
- Step back! He's in our custody now.

81
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,597
You got the wrong guy!

82
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,722
Transferred where?

83
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,663
Talk to me. Where am I going?

84
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,858
- Get in there now!
- Where am I going?

85
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:33,926
Hey!

86
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,530
Where are we going?

87
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:38,730
Hey! Talk to me!

88
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,932
Let's go, Leone. Come on!

89
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,998
- Get his ass out here!
- Come on, get out!

90
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:33,588
- Where the hell are we? I wanna know!
- Shut up!

91
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,364
You got the wrong man!
You made a mistake!

92
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,961
There's no mistake.

93
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,928
Welcome to Gateway, Leone.

94
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:52,258
- Drumgoole?
- That's Warden Drumgoole, convict.

95
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,762
- Captain.
- Move him!

96
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,092
Move your ass!

97
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,322
Let's go. Come on!

98
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:05,861
You'll be issued one bar of soap,
two rolls of toilet paper per month.

99
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,725
Somebody steals...
Turn your ass around!

100
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:13,956
Somebody steals them, or you lose
them, wipe your ass with your shirt.

101
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:18,222
You have one uniform.
Your number is 5-1-0. Remember it.

102
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:24,161
This is C-wing. You will eat, shower
and take your yard time with your wing.

103
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,297
There's 6 counts a day. Miss one,
you're in the hole. Miss two...

104
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,625
... I will put you in the house of pain.

105
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,959
Convict...

106
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,925
... two things.
One: I am Meissner.

107
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,360
Two: Never fuck with Meissner.

108
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,758
Inside.

109
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,956
- Sir, what about the cuffs?
- Let him get used to them.

110
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,733
You better watch your back, man!

111
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:46,222
Come on, guys. Let's go.

112
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,724
Nineteen-one.

113
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,599
Nineteen-one! Crack it!

114
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:22,428
Oh, yeah, you better not
eyeball me, boy.

115
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:27,225
How were your accommodations last
night? Like your mama used to do you?

116
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,192
- You did his mama, didn't you?
- Twice.

117
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,093
Hey!

118
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,597
Open the door! You hear me?

119
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:03,591
Hello, Frank.

120
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:09,330
In the old days, the warden would've
come down that private passageway...

121
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:14,558
... to this execution chamber to witness
the putting to death of a criminal.

122
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:20,432
120 men and 4 women were electrocuted
in that chair before it was retired.

123
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:25,600
Beautiful, isn't it? When I came here,
it was falling apart. I restored it...

124
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:31,029
... put it back into working order to
remind me of how things ought to be.

125
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:34,358
It's nearly five years since you
escaped from Treadmore.

126
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:38,931
- Time flies when you're having fun.
- In all my years as warden there...

127
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:43,534
... you're the only one who escaped.
- So I read in the papers.

128
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:46,860
Yes, you did.
You and your lawyer saw to it...

129
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:51,262
... that everything made it
into the papers. The media.

130
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:55,424
Distorting the facts,
making a criminal into a hero...

131
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:59,931
... and a warden into a criminal.
You took my future away from me.

132
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:05,090
You and those politicians. They sent
you to Norwood. That's a country club.

133
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:09,530
I ended up here in Gateway,
the worst shit-hole in the system.

134
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:12,668
You don't remember, do you?
I asked you.

135
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:15,824
No, I begged you, Drumgoole.
Do you remember that?

136
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:20,628
I had two weeks before I was released.
I asked for one hour to visit...

137
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:24,735
... with that old man before he died.
- I was doing my job.

138
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:27,425
There's a lot of ways to do your job!

139
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:31,592
You could've given me an escorted leave,
could've had armed guards.

140
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,963
You broke the law.
You broke the law, and I was punished!

141
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:41,427
- I got five years. I paid my debt!
- Not to me. But you're going to.

142
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:44,700
I've only got six months left
on my sentence.

143
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:48,393
In Gateway,
six months could be a lifetime.

144
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:52,729
This is hard time. You have no rights
here unless I give them to you.

145
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:57,028
You feel no pleasure unless
I tell you you can. This is hell...

146
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,861
... and I'm going to give you
the guided tour.

147
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:08,831
Okay, tough guy. Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue around.

148
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,332
You trying to kiss me, huh?

149
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,833
Let me see your ears.

150
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:25,358
What are you looking at, asshole?

151
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:27,729
- You check his nose?
- Checked it.

152
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,664
Good.

153
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:36,626
This is a delousing chamber.
Don't breathe.

154
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:41,928
X ylon-profic gas can be harmful to
your lungs. Stand with your legs apart...

155
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,364
... arms out and away from your body.

156
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:48,895
When I tell you, take a deep breath.
Hold it for 30 seconds.

157
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:51,729
Start now.

158
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:13,134
Ten seconds.

159
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:27,031
Not yet. He can take more.

160
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,163
Braden...

161
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:57,031
... you'll learn that inmates are physically
more capable than you could imagine.

162
00:17:57,203 --> 00:18:00,431
If you underestimate them...

163
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:03,468
... it will cost you dearly.

164
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:51,637
Watch out for the birds.

165
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:54,929
- What the hell you doing?
- Sorry.

166
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:04,994
Yo, Billy, get that weight.

167
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:27,432
Move it, ace. That's my spot.

168
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,603
That's my spot too.

169
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,537
- Any spot that isn't yours?
- Nope, they're all mine.

170
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:55,033
You wanna use it, you gotta pay.

171
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:01,436
Not so fast, ace.
I'm not gonna gouge you.

172
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:06,798
That little thing around your neck,
that'll buy you a spot for the day.

173
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:12,735
- Put a fucking hole in your heart.
- All right, break it up! Break it up!

174
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:15,370
I said, break it up! Back off!

175
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:18,867
Spread 'em. Back off!

176
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:23,731
- All right, Weber, drop the shank.
- There ain't no shank, Braden.

177
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,534
- All right, let's go.
- You motherfucker!

178
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:32,098
- Spread 'em, goddamn it.
- You're making a big mistake, asshole.

179
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:38,833
- You go in the hole for carrying that.
- Where's your witness, your evidence?

180
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,903
Well, where is it?

181
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,561
- He saw it.
- He didn't.

182
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:47,262
- You saw him carrying the shank, right?
- I didn't see nothing.

183
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:52,735
- You're making a bad mistake, Braden.
- Get him the fuck out of here!

184
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:03,301
He would have put that shank in you.
What did you cover for him for?

185
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:06,529
You got your rules, we got ours.

186
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:26,961
Hey, hey, hey. I do know the face,
and I do know the name.

187
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,662
Hey, Frank. Frank Leone, right?
Name's Dallas.

188
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:34,100
I was in Treadmore
right before you busted out.

189
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:38,170
- You were on A-block, weren't you?
- Yeah, I was on A-block.

190
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,305
- Good memory.
- Treadmore doesn't have an A-block.

191
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:46,495
- Watch your feet.
- Okay, dig it.

192
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:50,126
Look, look,
I was there on transfer, man.

193
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:52,964
Less than two hours,
but I know all about you.

194
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:58,833
- You're looking at a devoted fan.
- D. T. A.

195
00:21:59,738 --> 00:22:04,296
D. T. A. , okay. What's that, man?

196
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:09,097
Don't trust anybody.
Words to survive by. Watch your feet.

197
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:12,933
- D. T. A.
- D. T. A.

198
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:16,470
You gotta trust somebody.
Let me hip you to the joint.

199
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:21,072
See this fat tub of shit?
That's Manly. His partner's Wiley.

200
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,501
They're sadistic pigs.
They ain't happy unless they hurt you.

201
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:30,298
I mean, if the warden wants to put
the boot to you, he uses them.

202
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:34,802
The black dude in the booth
is Captain Meissner.

203
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:38,469
Now he runs the guards, okay?
He's one bad dude.

204
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:40,764
We already met. I gotta do my work.

205
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:45,462
Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool, man.

206
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:48,600
So listen, Frank...

207
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:52,830
... when you decide to make your break,
and I know you will...

208
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:56,370
... you come talk to me.
You come talk to Dallas.

209
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,972
Okay? Anything you want,
anything you need, man...

210
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,731
... I can get it. Anything.
All right? Okay?

211
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:03,973
No way. No damn way!

212
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,598
No way. No damn way!

213
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:10,830
You're always crying about how you
need a man who knows engines.

214
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,631
I brought you the man, Homes.

215
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:17,034
Look, don't "Homes" me.
The only thing you brought is trouble.

216
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,672
- Come on, Eclipse.
- I heard all about you, Leone.

217
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,862
Whatever is between you and
Drumgoole ain't coming in here.

218
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,596
The boys ain't got no problem with me.
I ain't got no problem with the boys.

219
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:37,131
Come on, Eclipse.
You're making me look bad.

220
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:43,136
- I promised the dude a job. You owe me.
- I don't owe you or nobody nothing.

221
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:48,136
Hey, you! Get your face out of that
motor! Get your face out of there.

222
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:52,533
You don't know nothing about motors.
Stay away from it! Okay?

223
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:55,671
It's been a while since I've seen
an old 265 small block.

224
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,465
That's the last time
you're gonna see one in this shop.

225
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,164
Come on. Frank, we can work this out.
We're all gentlemen here.

226
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:09,069
It's his place. He knows what he
wants. It's okay. Thanks anyway.

227
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,839
Thanks. You made me look beautiful.
I appreciate the endorsement.

228
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,973
Hey, Frank. Hold up, man.

229
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:23,968
You didn't want this job anyway, man.
Greasy fingers, oil on your clothes...

230
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:29,505
- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

231
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:33,162
- All right?
- Prison joke.

232
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:36,738
I lost my watch. Why don't you give me
a hand looking for it.

233
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:39,271
Roll your ass on out of here, man.

234
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,100
Officer Vazquez, you ought to
put on a few pounds. You look frail.

235
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:50,104
Frank, I meant what I said. I'm gonna
get you something good, easy, cool.

236
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:55,496
- You're gonna love it.
- Shut up. Get inside. Shut up. Inside!

237
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,797
Here's your shit from Norwood, Leone.

238
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,968
All right. Lock in!

239
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,233
Problem?

240
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,499
No, I got no problems.

241
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:36,530
I wanna know what's going on.

242
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,604
All I know is that he's in
the general population...

243
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:45,434
I don't give a damn about the general
population! I wanna know about Frank.

244
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:48,665
- I'm not leaving...
- Calm down. He's all right.

245
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:52,967
He was a model prisoner at Norwood.
Why bring him here?

246
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:56,006
Routine transfer.

247
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,535
- Hey, Frank?
- What?

248
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:08,331
Hey, man.

249
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,535
- It's hot in here, man.
- I know. But at least it's easy.

250
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:17,298
I know, man.
I'm sorry, I didn't do too good.

251
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:21,600
Walk with me. I gotta show you
something. It's important.

252
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:24,240
- No. Here, you try.
- No. Come on, man.

253
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,136
- You'll like it.
- I'm not into hard labour.

254
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:32,365
- It's cool. It's easy.
- Okay. There. I'm burnt out. Come on.

255
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:35,030
Come on, you're gonna love this.

256
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:38,665
Watch the steam, Frank.

257
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:46,763
I got these off this old trustee.
He did the plumbing here.

258
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:51,101
Everybody thought he was a nut.
Doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

259
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:54,536
- Come on, hurry up.
- All right, cool.

260
00:26:55,241 --> 00:27:00,106
The tunnels under every cellblock,
they lead to the steam plant, okay?

261
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:03,502
I go out across the steam lines.
Dig this.

262
00:27:03,674 --> 00:27:08,663
I shimmy, okay? Across the
steam pipes to the sally port, okay?

263
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:13,171
Over there, there's trucks coming
and going. I wait for my time...

264
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:18,429
... l'm on a truck that's leaving.
I'm dearly departing Dallas, man. Huh?

265
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:24,097
You're the doctor. Operate.
I want your professional opinion.

266
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:29,038
Let's run it backwards. I see these
trucks. They stop running at 9:00.

267
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:34,141
At 9:00, the tower guards are at full
staff and all the inmates are awake.

268
00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:39,240
Before you go 10 feet, every con in the
joint knows you're gone. And this thing...

269
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,001
... this shimmy?
- Shimmy slide.

270
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:46,267
You're gonna shimmy slide across
200 yards of steam pipe...

271
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:48,601
... running at 160 degrees
and get away with it?

272
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:53,936
You try, they'll change your name from
Departing Dallas to Deep-Fried Dallas.

273
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:01,137
- Just a thought, man.
- The thought that counts.

274
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:05,502
- I got a plane to catch. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Dallas?

275
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,270
You got a cigarette?

276
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:13,239
It's my last one. Here.
Go ahead. Finish that.

277
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,864
It ain't much,
but it's the thought that counts, right?

278
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:41,740
Last call. Mess hall, last call.
Mess, coming up.

279
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:49,373
Looks like some delicious garbage
stew. Just like Mom used to make.

280
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:52,008
That's why I shot her.

281
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:56,774
- Can I have some gravy, please?
- You want some gravy?

282
00:28:56,942 --> 00:29:00,101
- Here's your gravy.
- You got it all over my food.

283
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,037
- Move!
- What's your problem?

284
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,299
- Nothing. Move it!
- What's that kid's story?

285
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:07,100
In for murder.

286
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:11,039
Claims he was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

287
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:16,107
Waiting while his buddy bought beer.
Didn't know the guy was packing heat.

288
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:20,504
Two guys dead. Kid's doing
the Big Bitch now: Double life.

289
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,233
He'll make parole when he's about 400.

290
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,274
Move it!
What are you, a slow study or what?

291
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:30,466
Screw that guy.

292
00:29:32,043 --> 00:29:35,531
So I didn't get a chance
to make the reservation...

293
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:38,834
... so why don't we get a seat
over there.

294
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:42,268
- What are you doing?
- Taking this.

295
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:47,341
- Why don't you go take something else?
- I'll throw you through this table.

296
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,976
- Want some cake?
- Are you chumping off on me?

297
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:51,837
- Not hungry. Want this?
- Who are you?

298
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,441
Nobody. Here.

299
00:29:55,376 --> 00:30:00,809
- I'm on a diet. This spot taken?
- Why don't you stand up to that dirtbag?

300
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:03,875
Shut up.
He just saved you a lot of healing.

301
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,506
What's your name?

302
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:10,267
Why does anybody need a name
in a joint like this?

303
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:12,466
Helps when you get mail.

304
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:16,498
Oh, yeah. I need a name?
They call me Killer.

305
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:21,506
That's original. Did you think that up,
or did someone give you a hand with it?

306
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:24,836
- I call myself what I want, okay?
- Okay.

307
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:29,237
Killer, this is Dallas. I'm Frank.
Dallas, what do you think this is here?

308
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,342
- Wanna give me an idea?
- These might be peas.

309
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,442
They might not.
They might be toxic waste.

310
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,676
Who cares? It's all crap.

311
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:43,773
- Eat vegetables to grow big and strong.
- Stick your vegetables. Nobody asked.

312
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:47,773
We got 325 other killers in here.
Most, unlike you, live up to it.

313
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:52,272
Put your leg in the aisle.
Be ready to move.

314
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:56,137
Hey, nobody tells me
to do nothing, all right?

315
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:26,911
You always gotta be ready to move first.
You just might make it to first base.

316
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:32,504
First base.
There's a name for him, huh?

317
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,775
- It's good to be outside.
- It's cold.

318
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,876
It's not that bad.
It's good to keep moving.

319
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:52,169
How come you got this up attitude?
How can you be up in this joint?

320
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:56,800
It's a mindset. Your body has to
be in here, but your brain doesn't.

321
00:31:56,977 --> 00:32:00,239
As long as you keep moving,
you don't become a piece of this place.

322
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:02,502
- What's that, like, guru stuff?
- Yeah.

323
00:32:02,677 --> 00:32:06,268
- Maybe I should become a guru.
- You getting sarcastic?

324
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,770
Fucking birds.

325
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:15,106
Fucking birds don't eat in the rain.

326
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:21,039
- Yeah, well, they'll come back.
- You save your bread for me tomorrow?

327
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:24,039
Yeah, sure.
Put that on your list, okay?

328
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:26,335
Thanks.

329
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,999
Why you talking crazy, man?
It's a waste of time.

330
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:33,041
To you, it's a waste.
To him, it's all he's got.

331
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:36,540
That's more than you got.
In here, you gotta respect that.

332
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:41,541
You don't get much, and what you got,
you gotta protect. You know that?

333
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:45,268
You don't know nothing yet.
Come on, let's run.

334
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:53,669
- Come on, Frank.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

335
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm gonna get wet.
Send you my laundry bills.

336
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:10,243
Feel something, Leone?

337
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:14,806
Wanna play? They're a man short.

338
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:25,643
Hey! I'm talking to you!

339
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:32,342
Hey, punk! When you gonna paint your
nails and answer to the name "bitch"?

340
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:39,544
- You got a big mouth. Keep it shut.
- You fucker, I'll tear your ass off!

341
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:44,638
You wanna play? We'll play.
You talk too much. Let's play.

342
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:49,744
Goddamn right we'll play. You
and I'll play later, you little fuck.

343
00:34:02,978 --> 00:34:08,968
You want more, Leone? We got more
for you. Come on. Come on.

344
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:14,634
- Stay down!
- That's a cheap shot!

345
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:24,035
- What kind of game is this?
- This ain't no game. This is a lesson.

346
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,171
- Got something to say?
- Yeah.

347
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:47,312
- Say it! Say it!
- First down!

348
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:51,968
Fuck you. That's your last one!
You're dead, Leone!

349
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:55,442
You'll never last the fucking game!

350
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:13,671
Get in there, hit him.
Come on, get in there.

351
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,374
Set!

352
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:21,035
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

353
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:45,635
I'll beat you up, man.

354
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,604
Frank!

355
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,178
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

356
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:32,441
Fuck up! Get over on that other team.
That's who you're playing for anyway.

357
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,043
- What took you so long?
- You need the help...

358
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:44,543
... and I need the exercise.
So call the play.

359
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,871
You're dead, Leone!

360
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,942
- Shit, what hit me?
- F-train, son. F-train.

361
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,769
Don't lay down on me now. Come on.

362
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,338
Come on, Leone.
Come on, you son of a bitch!

363
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:32,275
All right,
I'm going over tackle on two.

364
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:33,673
All right, Frank!

365
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,339
Ready.

366
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,176
Set.

367
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,537
You're dead!

368
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:43,537
Hut-one.

369
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:46,340
Hut-two.

370
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,737
Go, baby!

371
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:57,938
Come on, Frank!

372
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:15,004
We did it!

373
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,306
Hey, come on Wiley. Come on, man!

374
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:49,813
Next time I want, you give.

375
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:04,612
Move it. Out. The game is over.
Let's go. You don't listen, do you?

376
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:09,606
- You okay? Come on. Come on.
- Put him down!

377
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:15,237
You ain't no doctor. He's on his own.
Get inside.

378
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:22,640
Real badass, huh?

379
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:26,138
See you inside, Leone.

380
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:33,445
Count time, 10 minutes. All inmates
will return to their wings for count.

381
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:41,647
Let's go, men!

382
00:40:26,948 --> 00:40:29,176
You won't break me.

383
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:58,474
Still interested in the job?

384
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:02,674
Yeah, I am.

385
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:24,839
You sure know your way around
an engine. Who taught you?

386
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,812
This old man named Galleti.

387
00:41:28,983 --> 00:41:31,471
Took me off the street
when I was 14.

388
00:41:31,649 --> 00:41:35,241
Taught me that I could do something
besides hanging out on corners.

389
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:39,610
- Where is everybody?
- It's quitting time.

390
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:43,011
- Is that who you broke out for?
- Yeah. I owed him.

391
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:47,115
Tell me, what put you in the joint
in the first place?

392
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:51,306
One night these punks broke into the
garage and put a beating on Galleti.

393
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:54,505
The whole neighbourhood knew about it.
The cops knew.

394
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:59,512
But these punks were connected,
so the cops didn't do anything. I did.

395
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:01,944
So after all the smoke had cleared...

396
00:42:02,116 --> 00:42:07,514
... these guys were in the hospital, and I
was doing time for aggravated assault.

397
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,881
- Care to join me in a little contraband?
- Why not?

398
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:16,475
I can see why they call you Eclipse.

399
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:20,240
- I do block a lot of sun, don't I?
- That you do.

400
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:25,644
I had a guy on the outside that used
to get me good Havanas. Not this crap.

401
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:28,441
But someday... Someday.

402
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:30,980
Yeah, someday.

403
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,171
- That's not bad.
- At least they're cheap.

404
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,340
Eclipse, what do you
got hiding back there?

405
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:43,679
That's my baby.

406
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:51,142
- Good bodywork.
- Call this here vehicle Maybelline.

407
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,747
- Hello, Maybelline.
- This is my baby.

408
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:55,438
Nice.

409
00:42:57,983 --> 00:43:01,143
There it is. '65 Ford Mustang V8.

410
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:04,112
Two eighty-nine, with 225 horsepower.

411
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:07,943
- When did you last turn her over?
- She's been dead for 15 years.

412
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:13,344
Couple guys tried to get her going
and couldn't. I'm a body man myself.

413
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:16,506
- Mind if I give it a try?
- It's a dead issue.

414
00:43:18,984 --> 00:43:22,144
Nothing's dead around here
until it's buried.

415
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:29,109
Save the headstone, man.

416
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,147
Easy, easy...

417
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:08,608
Eclipse. Nothing's dead till
it's buried. Did I tell you that?

418
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:14,844
I love it!

419
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:16,518
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

420
00:46:16,518 --> 00:46:20,007
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

421
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:23,342
- The poem.
- It's a jailhouse poem.

422
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:26,007
- Something we all wrote.
- Excuse me.

423
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:32,174
When we're in a sober mood
We worry, work and think

424
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:36,341
When we're in a drunken mood
We gamble, play and drink

425
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:40,645
But when our moods are over
When our time has come to pass

426
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:45,751
We hope they bury us upside down
So the warden can kiss our ass

427
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:47,851
- Amen!
- I like that.

428
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:50,883
- You like that, huh?
- It's a little catchy.

429
00:46:52,986 --> 00:46:56,474
This is the best.
I mean, this is good, man.

430
00:46:56,652 --> 00:46:59,447
- What's wrong, man?
- Nothing.

431
00:47:00,752 --> 00:47:05,650
I wouldn't smoke around this, but
it tastes as good as any dollar wine.

432
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:07,842
Check, please.

433
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,679
Wait.
When my moods are over

434
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:14,511
And my...
That's not it. Wait a minute.

435
00:47:16,152 --> 00:47:19,380
You married,
or thinking about it, or what?

436
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:22,950
Are you proposing to me?
You're not my type.

437
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:25,346
- No, I'm not married.
- Not married?

438
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:31,611
- Plan to get married when you get out?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

439
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:36,184
- You know, I had this really nice girl.
- Yeah?

440
00:47:36,352 --> 00:47:39,011
She was nice. And we were in love.

441
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:42,781
And we started talking
about getting married.

442
00:47:42,952 --> 00:47:47,111
She's got three brothers, like,
about 1 percent retarded, these guys.

443
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:49,308
They throw a beating on me.

444
00:47:49,752 --> 00:47:52,479
Some guys don't appreciate romance.

445
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,981
Don't take it personal.

446
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:59,778
She wrote me for a while.
Then it just stopped.

447
00:47:59,952 --> 00:48:04,974
That's when it hit me: I ain't
ever gonna be with a girl again.

448
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:09,642
I'm gonna end up like Eclipse,
kissing pictures in magazines.

449
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:12,785
There's so many things I ain't done.

450
00:48:12,951 --> 00:48:16,646
- I ain't never learned how to drive.
- What?

451
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,877
I ain't never learned
how to drive a car.

452
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,309
I hope we don't get a speeding ticket.
I'd hate to end up in jail.

453
00:48:27,486 --> 00:48:32,748
Don't be a wise guy. You wanna learn
to drive? This is the best I can do.

454
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,113
Okay. Now cut it sharp.
That's it. All right.

455
00:48:37,286 --> 00:48:42,309
Hang a left on 42nd Street. We'll go
to Broadway and check out the action.

456
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,145
Broadway?
We're doing circles in a garage.

457
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,308
Come on, First,
work here with me, okay?

458
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:51,475
You wanna stay here
or check out the action?

459
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:54,346
I wanna check out the action,
of course.

460
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:57,983
- Turn left on 42nd Street.
- I got it.

461
00:48:58,753 --> 00:49:02,310
Look, the place is jumping.
Look at the action here!

462
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:06,885
Check out those ladies!
Wanna come for a ride in my new car?

463
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:09,450
- Hey, baby!
- They ain't responding.

464
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,313
They're not your type.
When were you last in Atlantic City?

465
00:49:13,486 --> 00:49:16,974
- I ain't never been there.
- You are now. What do you think?

466
00:49:17,153 --> 00:49:21,983
- I don't know. What does it resemble?
- It's the best. Look at the lights.

467
00:49:22,153 --> 00:49:25,313
The Boardwalk
is jumping day and night.

468
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:29,383
It's hot music. You got high rollers.
You got parties.

469
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:34,247
You got money. You got gambling.
You got 10,000 chorus girls!

470
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,682
Hey, baby, wanna come for a ride
in my new vehicle?

471
00:49:38,853 --> 00:49:40,819
Man. Yo, that was great, man.

472
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:45,180
I hate to tell you, your engine just blew
a rod. You're ready for Indianapolis.

473
00:49:45,353 --> 00:49:46,943
You got the touch.

474
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,608
Frank, let me ask you one favour, man.

475
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:52,378
I appreciate the drive
and everything...

476
00:49:52,553 --> 00:49:56,485
... but none of this is real unless I
hear this engine kick over just once.

477
00:49:56,653 --> 00:50:00,949
If I turn the engine on, the guards
will bust in here and grab us...

478
00:50:01,154 --> 00:50:04,120
... and throw us in the hole forever.
Forget it.

479
00:50:04,287 --> 00:50:08,151
Come on, Frank. Just for 10 seconds.
It'll last for the rest of my life.

480
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,184
You're such a pain in the ass.

481
00:50:11,354 --> 00:50:17,753
Come on, Frank. Let me just
hear that engine. We built it, man.

482
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:23,383
All right, go on. Ten seconds.

483
00:50:25,454 --> 00:50:28,942
Yeah! All right, looking good!

484
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:32,547
- Ain't that great?
- It's beautiful, baby.

485
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:34,482
Hit it, one time!

486
00:50:34,654 --> 00:50:36,552
All right, one more time.

487
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:38,844
Damn it, Frank.

488
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,282
Okay, turn it off.
You got it, you did it. Turn it off.

489
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:46,251
Hey, kill it, Frank. Come on, man.

490
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:48,978
Come on, First. Turn it off.

491
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:53,246
If I turn it off I ain't never
gonna turn it on again, right?

492
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,444
That's right.

493
00:50:55,621 --> 00:50:58,678
Please, turn it off, First.

494
00:50:58,853 --> 00:51:01,479
- First!
- Sorry, Frank.

495
00:51:01,654 --> 00:51:02,677
Oh, shit!

496
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:05,376
Frank, turn it off
and get him out of that car.

497
00:51:05,554 --> 00:51:07,179
Get him out!

498
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:09,183
Frank, get on that kid.

499
00:51:09,354 --> 00:51:11,513
Stop that kid!

500
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:17,243
Look out!

501
00:51:31,887 --> 00:51:33,876
First! First!

502
00:51:34,053 --> 00:51:37,281
First, turn it off, you crazy bastard!

503
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,979
All right, stop that car now.

504
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:47,746
I repeat, stop that car now!

505
00:51:52,021 --> 00:51:54,351
They're gonna kill you!

506
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:02,312
- This is Meissner. Stop firing.
- The warden said...

507
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:05,976
- Goddamn it, I said stop firing!
- Hold it, hold it.

508
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:12,187
First, turn it off! Hold it. Hold it.

509
00:52:14,188 --> 00:52:18,018
Look out! Look out, Frank.
Look out, man!

510
00:52:18,188 --> 00:52:21,677
Get out of the car!
They're gonna kill your ass.

511
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:24,150
- Did you see that ride?
- Are you crazy?

512
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:27,809
- It's beautiful. I can drive.
- It's beautiful...

513
00:52:27,988 --> 00:52:31,886
All right. You're one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

514
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,344
Move!

515
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:43,452
- You bought yourself a trip to the hole.
- Leave Frank alone!

516
00:52:45,388 --> 00:52:48,876
Let's go, let's go. Break it up!
Break it up! Let's go.

517
00:52:49,054 --> 00:52:52,952
Let him go. You have the wrong man.

518
00:52:53,388 --> 00:52:55,320
- Take Leone to the hole.
- Back off.

519
00:52:55,488 --> 00:52:58,045
- Six weeks.
- It was my fault, sir!

520
00:52:58,221 --> 00:52:59,346
Save it.

521
00:52:59,522 --> 00:53:01,749
Get off me.

522
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,986
Captain?

523
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:10,315
I want five inmates. Give me a bat.
I wanna break up this car.

524
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,352
Hold it right there, now!

525
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:17,481
I want you to watch this, Leone.

526
00:54:26,523 --> 00:54:29,318
Back to the honeymoon suite!

527
00:54:34,955 --> 00:54:36,784
Night.

528
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:43,547
- You should've been notified...
- Why is he in isolation?

529
00:54:43,755 --> 00:54:46,347
- I don't have that information.
- You don't have it?

530
00:54:46,523 --> 00:54:49,182
Then I wanna see
the goddamn warden!

531
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:50,787
Not today.

532
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:55,322
Every hour when the light comes on,
you'll stand, face the camera...

533
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:57,818
... and state your name and number.

534
00:54:57,989 --> 00:55:00,012
Name and number!

535
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:01,814
Leone, five-ten.

536
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,955
Face the camera.

537
00:55:04,122 --> 00:55:06,486
Name and number.

538
00:55:07,655 --> 00:55:10,281
Leone, five-ten.

539
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,486
Name and number.

540
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,787
Leone, five-ten.

541
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:29,388
Leone, five-ten.

542
00:55:29,556 --> 00:55:32,182
Leone. Leone. Leone.

543
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:36,022
Name and number.

544
00:55:40,956 --> 00:55:44,888
Leone, five-ten.

545
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,286
On your feet. Name and number.

546
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,753
Give Mr. Leone half rations
the rest of his time.

547
00:55:58,923 --> 00:55:59,946
Yes, sir.

548
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:01,947
Name and number!

549
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,017
Get up!

550
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,019
He seems a little sluggish.

551
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,146
Wake him up.

552
00:56:26,023 --> 00:56:27,784
Cold enough?

553
00:56:39,456 --> 00:56:43,253
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

554
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:47,384
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

555
00:56:47,556 --> 00:56:49,613
You got a little cruel streak.

556
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:54,455
Leone, five-ten.

557
00:56:56,624 --> 00:57:00,352
- Upright. Name and number.
- Leone, five-ten.

558
00:57:07,191 --> 00:57:10,850
You'll be praying for some time
on your own. You know that?

559
00:57:11,024 --> 00:57:15,150
- I don't believe that.
- Trust me. I know about these things.

560
00:57:16,457 --> 00:57:18,787
Leone, five-ten.

561
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:20,946
Water.

562
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,350
Leone, five-ten.

563
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,555
Name and number.

564
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:36,985
Name and number!
Name and number!

565
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:39,521
Marilyn Monroe.

566
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:45,554
Thirty-seven, something, thirty-five.

567
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:57,453
Crack 121.

568
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:06,250
Listen, I didn't mean it.
No, I didn't say anything at all. No!

569
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:21,456
That's enough.

570
00:58:36,357 --> 00:58:38,880
- Who ordered this?
- The warden.

571
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,847
Does the warden hate him enough
to kill him? 'Cause that ain't my job.

572
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:48,354
Mr. Sensitive. He thinks
we're treating Leone too rough.

573
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,650
Forget which are the cops
and which are the cons?

574
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:53,814
- You want me? Come on!
- Break it up!

575
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:57,117
Damn it, I said break it up!
Break it up!

576
00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:05,490
Your stick, Mr. Braden.

577
00:59:10,525 --> 00:59:11,752
Pussy.

578
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:15,755
Get out of my sight, before I shine
my boots with your face...

579
00:59:15,925 --> 00:59:19,550
... you fat piece of shit! Go on!

580
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,983
Time's up.

581
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:56,182
Remember what I told you, Frank.

582
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:01,655
Roll with the system. Roll with it
or it's only gonna get harder.

583
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:09,052
Yeah, and it's getting shorter too.

584
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:29,116
So, what's new, Mr. Braden?

585
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:35,191
How's the family? Good?

586
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,121
How are the Jets doing?

587
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:41,349
Don't forget to check your bed.

588
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:39,185
Hey, Frank.

589
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:42,552
Somebody die in here?

590
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:46,947
Ain't a very good welcome home, is it?

591
01:01:57,392 --> 01:01:59,756
Hey, big man.

592
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:05,119
Sand. The whole engine block
is full of it. It was Chink.

593
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:08,190
What are we gonna do about it?

594
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:10,622
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

595
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:15,123
We poured everything we got into this
car. No way we can let Chink slide.

596
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:18,316
- Let it go, First Base.
- Let it go?!

597
01:02:18,493 --> 01:02:21,516
Aren't you the guy who says
you gotta protect what's yours...

598
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:25,489
... watch each other's back,
you watch mine, I watch yours?

599
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,990
I guess that was a bunch of jive,
now that you're a short-timer.

600
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,456
You're incredible. What?

601
01:02:33,627 --> 01:02:36,821
You think this is your car?
This ain't your car.

602
01:02:36,994 --> 01:02:41,858
This is the warden's car. Did you
think that Chink Weber did this?

603
01:02:42,027 --> 01:02:45,288
Drumgoole did this.
Come on.

604
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:49,256
Did you think we were gonna
take our dates out in this car?

605
01:02:49,427 --> 01:02:51,552
Maybe rotate it on weekends.

606
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,783
Ernie, why don't you take it Friday.
Dallas, take it Saturday.

607
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,187
And Eclipse, you got it Sunday!
Is that what you thought?

608
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,759
It's his! This lift is his, these
tools are his, the garage is his!

609
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:08,154
This whole goddamn place is his.

610
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:12,152
And you better remember that,
because once you buy into this...

611
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:17,749
... "our car, " "our thing" concept,
man, you're his too!

612
01:03:25,627 --> 01:03:27,525
Just let it go.

613
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:33,550
- I thought you were our leader.
- Goddamn it, I'm not your leader!

614
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,191
And this ain't a gang.

615
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,849
We're convicts.
We're prisoners, we're inmates.

616
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:43,118
We're here. And as long as we're
here, we're gonna stay his.

617
01:03:43,293 --> 01:03:45,759
We're his.

618
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:48,484
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

619
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,387
You gotta face the facts.

620
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,186
Now, you guys are standup,
no doubt about it.

621
01:03:55,361 --> 01:04:00,453
But I got three weeks to get out of
here. And in three weeks, I'm walking.

622
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:04,958
Ain't nothing gonna change that.

623
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:07,491
That's all I care about.

624
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:21,621
It's nothing for nothing, man.
He's right.

625
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:38,890
Leone, how do you like my belt buckle,
boy? Yeah, I know. I like it too.

626
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,254
A little souvenir
that reminds me of you.

627
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:46,758
Tell me, what are you
going to do about it?

628
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:55,959
You mean six weeks in the hole
killed your guts and your appetite?

629
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:02,684
It ain't over, you son of a bitch.

630
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:19,255
- Anybody call this spot?
- You guys don't need reservations.

631
01:05:19,428 --> 01:05:24,122
- You on a diet, Frank? Huh, man?
- Cutting back a little bit.

632
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:28,458
- Take some of my food.
- Here you go. Don't worry about it.

633
01:05:28,628 --> 01:05:29,787
- Bread.
- Thanks.

634
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,859
Some tomatoes.
You'll be all right. Celery stick.

635
01:05:33,027 --> 01:05:34,459
I ain't playing football.

636
01:05:34,628 --> 01:05:39,527
Don't worry about that guy. He's a
lifer. You only got a few weeks to go.

637
01:05:39,695 --> 01:05:41,217
Forget about him.

638
01:05:41,796 --> 01:05:44,853
A miracle just happened.
First Base finally learned something.

639
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,994
I doubt it.

640
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:50,121
- Okay, who's gonna say grace?
- Grace.

641
01:05:50,295 --> 01:05:52,352
She was terrific, wasn't she?

642
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:57,825
- I thought I could rely on you, Weber.
- He won't be pushed.

643
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,291
Because you're not pushing
in the right place.

644
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:04,451
Everyone has a weak spot, Weber.

645
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:09,391
Find his, or I'll have
to find a new yard boss.

646
01:06:12,562 --> 01:06:16,255
- Welcome to the Gateway Stakes.
- I feel like a steamed vegetable.

647
01:06:16,429 --> 01:06:19,190
- Let's start the race.
- All right. What's your bug's name?

648
01:06:19,362 --> 01:06:22,123
- Dirt Creature.
- Three-to-two on Dirt Creature.

649
01:06:22,295 --> 01:06:24,523
- First Base, what's your bug's name?
- Rear Entry.

650
01:06:24,695 --> 01:06:26,388
Rear Entry's 4-to-5.
Place your bets.

651
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:31,153
Two'll get you three, five'll get
you four. Five'll get you four.

652
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:36,056
Everything I got on Dirt Creature.

653
01:06:36,262 --> 01:06:40,820
- I bet the house on Rear Entry.
- The window is closed. All bets are in.

654
01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:43,359
Gentlemen, start your insects.

655
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:45,960
- On your marks, get set...
- Come on, Dirt.

656
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:48,219
Boom! They're off.

657
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:53,317
I've got a steak dinner
on this victory.

658
01:06:53,495 --> 01:06:55,620
Come on, Dirt. Come on.

659
01:06:58,295 --> 01:06:59,488
You can't do that.

660
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:01,184
We got a steward's inquiry.

661
01:07:01,362 --> 01:07:03,021
You can't push your bug!

662
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:05,888
It was a come-from-behind
victory by Rear Entry!

663
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:08,357
- We're gonna rerun the race.
- Hey, no rematch.

664
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:12,393
- Hey! What are you guys doing?
- Shit.

665
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:16,617
- Peña! You're on the wrong detail.
- Stand up.

666
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:19,523
Get you ass up here!
Clean up the gym.

667
01:07:19,695 --> 01:07:22,662
- We got a rematch later, all right?
- Sure.

668
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:25,655
I'm getting out of here.
I'll pay up later.

669
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:27,125
Now, asshole!

670
01:07:27,696 --> 01:07:31,685
Give me a break. I gotta get
dressed. You know what I mean?

671
01:07:31,862 --> 01:07:33,794
Hey, watch out for my bug.

672
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:37,156
I'll take care of him
for you, really. Delicious.

673
01:07:37,862 --> 01:07:41,454
- Come on, let's do it today!
- All right.

674
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:02,493
- Clean this place up.
- It's already cleaned.

675
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:06,151
- What are you, deaf?
- Shut your mouth and do it.

676
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:54,186
Come on. One by one, come on!

677
01:09:56,663 --> 01:09:58,493
Come on.

678
01:10:01,863 --> 01:10:04,056
Get him down there.

679
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:14,627
Pull his head.

680
01:10:18,497 --> 01:10:21,894
I told you we'd play later,
you little bitch.

681
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,858
Hey, Leone!

682
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:39,121
- They got First.
- I can't hear you.

683
01:10:41,464 --> 01:10:45,759
- What did you say?
- They got First Base in the gym.

684
01:10:46,497 --> 01:10:50,328
- What is it?
- They got First Base in the gym.

685
01:11:05,465 --> 01:11:07,556
First!

686
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:38,523
Twenty years old.

687
01:11:38,831 --> 01:11:44,786
This kid's twenty years old.
I told you.

688
01:11:44,964 --> 01:11:48,453
I know. I know.

689
01:11:56,697 --> 01:11:59,788
You want me, you got me.

690
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:03,253
You fucking Nazi.

691
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:07,830
You want me, you got me.

692
01:12:40,132 --> 01:12:41,961
Get him. Get him!

693
01:12:42,132 --> 01:12:46,996
- I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
- Come on, fight. Fight!

694
01:13:20,832 --> 01:13:23,025
Kick his ass!

695
01:13:35,332 --> 01:13:37,195
I'll kill you.

696
01:13:38,565 --> 01:13:40,122
Son of a bitch.

697
01:13:41,032 --> 01:13:42,622
I'll kill you.

698
01:14:21,966 --> 01:14:23,296
Do it.

699
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:25,729
Crush his face!

700
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:31,530
- Do it!
- Take him out!

701
01:14:31,699 --> 01:14:33,290
Drop it! Drop it!

702
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:56,496
God.

703
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:17,392
Linen run!

704
01:15:17,566 --> 01:15:21,158
Get a move on.
I'm trying to make a living here.

705
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,764
Frank, my man. Florence Nightingale.

706
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:30,159
- How you feeling?
- All right.

707
01:15:30,332 --> 01:15:34,560
- Three weeks and you're out, man.
- Feels like three years.

708
01:15:34,766 --> 01:15:38,255
Come on, man.
Three weeks is a blink.

709
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:42,390
What'd they do with the kid?

710
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:49,065
They sent him home, man.
What'd you think? You know.

711
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:54,829
You know, the kid told me once...

712
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,358
... "Your body has to be in prison, but
your mind can be wherever it wants. "

713
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:03,899
He tell you that?

714
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,632
Listen, I brought you
some toilet paper...

715
01:16:10,801 --> 01:16:15,200
... in case, you know, you want
to write some poetry or something.

716
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:21,160
Hey, Colonel Klink.
Let me out of here, man.

717
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,330
Frank, man,
it wasn't your fault, okay?

718
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,757
Remember that.

719
01:16:38,901 --> 01:16:43,833
Roberta, have Miss Lowell photographed
for an I. D. For visitation.

720
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:46,796
I'm reinstating
Mr. Leone's privileges.

721
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:48,262
Yes, sir.

722
01:16:48,434 --> 01:16:53,457
- I want to make sure Frank's all right.
- He's fine. He's recovering.

723
01:16:53,634 --> 01:16:58,259
In three weeks he'll be out, and you can
look forward to a happy life together.

724
01:16:58,434 --> 01:17:01,798
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you, warden.

725
01:17:07,467 --> 01:17:09,729
Okay, look into the light.

726
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,523
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

727
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,393
Hi, come here, you.

728
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:27,659
- I was so worried.
- You look great.

729
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:32,528
Thirty-minute visit, Leone. Compliments
of the warden. Don't waste it.

730
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,064
- How do you feel?
- Good, thanks, sweetheart.

731
01:17:36,267 --> 01:17:41,564
Thirty minutes. You need any help,
just give us a call, huh?

732
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:49,331
- Are they all like that?
- Don't worry. You look great.

733
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:50,797
You look...

734
01:17:50,968 --> 01:17:54,400
Don't tell me what I look like.
I can't stand it.

735
01:17:54,568 --> 01:17:57,625
I've missed you so much.

736
01:18:06,035 --> 01:18:09,797
No more separations. Promise?

737
01:18:10,002 --> 01:18:12,627
I promise.

738
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:31,665
- Time's up.
- Nice view.

739
01:18:31,868 --> 01:18:34,527
- What's the matter with you?
- Time's up.

740
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:38,031
- The warden said half an hour.
- He changed his mind.

741
01:18:39,168 --> 01:18:42,067
What do you mean?
I wanna talk to the warden.

742
01:18:42,268 --> 01:18:47,031
What you wanna do is keep your mouth
shut, fix your clothes and get out.

743
01:18:47,201 --> 01:18:49,793
- Come on.
- Don't touch her.

744
01:18:50,535 --> 01:18:52,831
What did you say?

745
01:18:53,002 --> 01:18:57,832
- Don't touch her? You don't learn, pal.
- Hey, I'm leaving.

746
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:05,759
Three weeks.
Three weeks. Three weeks.

747
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:34,898
Leone.

748
01:19:35,369 --> 01:19:37,392
Come here.

749
01:19:43,135 --> 01:19:44,362
Do I know you?

750
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:48,058
No, you don't know me, Frank,
but I know you.

751
01:19:48,335 --> 01:19:50,767
I was at Treadmore with you.

752
01:19:52,803 --> 01:19:54,894
A-block.

753
01:19:55,636 --> 01:19:59,159
- Treadmore don't have an A-block.
- That's right.

754
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:03,131
- We got something else in common.
- Yeah, what's that?

755
01:20:03,335 --> 01:20:05,029
We're both getting out soon.

756
01:20:05,302 --> 01:20:09,894
You in a few weeks.
Me, I'm gone the day after tomorrow.

757
01:20:10,636 --> 01:20:12,625
What happened to you?

758
01:20:12,836 --> 01:20:15,631
One beating too many.

759
01:20:15,836 --> 01:20:20,768
I served some hard time in this place.
We both have, am I right?

760
01:20:22,202 --> 01:20:25,464
Yeah, you're right about that.

761
01:20:25,702 --> 01:20:29,896
You need anything when I get out?
Can I get you anything?

762
01:20:30,169 --> 01:20:34,898
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.
- I'm just lucky, I guess.

763
01:20:35,068 --> 01:20:41,023
I got a job lined up. Temporary, but
it pays a grand for two hours of work.

764
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:44,360
- That's not bad, is it?
- What do you gotta do?

765
01:20:47,903 --> 01:20:52,858
I just gotta rape this bitch. I get an
extra hundred every time she screams.

766
01:20:53,035 --> 01:20:56,661
- I'll kill you for that!
- Payback time, Frank.

767
01:20:56,869 --> 01:20:58,892
- Chink says hello.
- You touch her, you're dead!

768
01:20:59,335 --> 01:21:02,028
Hey, bailiff! Guard!
Guard! Somebody!

769
01:21:02,202 --> 01:21:06,498
Manly! Manly! Guard!

770
01:21:07,068 --> 01:21:09,557
- What's your problem?
- I gotta use the phone.

771
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:14,795
- You know your privileges. No phone.
- That guy is gonna kill my girlfriend.

772
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,401
- What guy?
- The guy that was just here.

773
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:22,195
- The guy in the wheelchair!
- What are you trying to pull, Leone?

774
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:25,859
Don't play with me, Manly.
Please, I gotta warn her.

775
01:21:26,036 --> 01:21:30,025
Everybody's got problems, Leone.
Get some sleep.

776
01:21:30,203 --> 01:21:35,192
Goddamn, you fat motherfucker!
Goddamn!

777
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:44,702
Hey, Frank. Doing some
spring-cleaning, huh, man?

778
01:21:45,303 --> 01:21:47,895
Dallas, come here.

779
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,898
Yeah?

780
01:21:52,904 --> 01:21:56,836
- What is it, man?
- I need some help.

781
01:21:57,003 --> 01:21:59,492
No questions asked.

782
01:22:01,403 --> 01:22:05,165
You're busting out?
You got less than three weeks.

783
01:22:05,336 --> 01:22:06,563
Just help me.

784
01:22:06,804 --> 01:22:09,997
- This is gonna take days.
- I need it tonight.

785
01:22:10,203 --> 01:22:13,692
I can't do that.
Everything is gonna be locked up.

786
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:17,267
There's a con getting
out of here tomorrow.

787
01:22:17,503 --> 01:22:20,991
- Chink Weber paid him to get Melissa.
- I understand.

788
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:26,567
I'd love to help, but I can't do
the impossible. You're hurting my arm.

789
01:22:32,403 --> 01:22:35,130
I'll take you with me.

790
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:39,692
No shit?

791
01:22:40,203 --> 01:22:42,863
- What's the plan?
- You'll know when you gotta know.

792
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:48,133
Going for the tunnels, huh, man?

793
01:22:48,336 --> 01:22:50,666
You just be here, all right?

794
01:22:51,837 --> 01:22:54,200
Convict, move it out of there!

795
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:59,201
Hey, use some bleach on that, Frank.
I'm coming out, Colonel Klink.

796
01:23:03,337 --> 01:23:04,564
Linen run.

797
01:23:04,738 --> 01:23:08,067
- Evening, Officer Vazquez.
- You're late. Get in there.

798
01:23:08,304 --> 01:23:09,531
- Yes, sir.
- Quick.

799
01:23:09,805 --> 01:23:12,862
- I'll be real quick.
- Still making that jailhouse booze?

800
01:23:13,137 --> 01:23:17,467
Absolutely not, sir. I'm on the wagon.
I joined Alcoholics Unanimous.

801
01:23:17,704 --> 01:23:20,568
- You got some line of shit.
- It's bad on my nervous system.

802
01:23:20,805 --> 01:23:23,464
- Makes me talk too much.
- Just make it quick.

803
01:23:23,671 --> 01:23:27,000
Yeah, I'll be right out, sir.
Right out.

804
01:23:34,538 --> 01:23:37,003
No. Help! Oh, shit!

805
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:41,360
Help me!

806
01:23:43,471 --> 01:23:45,164
Come on, Frank. Let's go.

807
01:23:45,404 --> 01:23:47,632
Okay, come on. That's it.

808
01:23:51,004 --> 01:23:54,334
- All right, we got 10 minutes. Move it.
- All right.

809
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,469
Sweet dreams, Moby Dick.

810
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:58,693
- Frank?
- Come on.

811
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:00,766
The tools, man.

812
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:16,168
You got it.

813
01:24:18,337 --> 01:24:20,769
Okay, here I go.

814
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:23,863
Oh, God. I'm jumping.

815
01:24:26,804 --> 01:24:29,327
Man, there's rats in here.

816
01:24:40,638 --> 01:24:43,127
- All right. I'm all right. No!
- What?

817
01:24:43,305 --> 01:24:46,567
- This way. It's a shortcut to the plant.
- It's this way.

818
01:24:46,772 --> 01:24:51,999
No, man, I remember the map.
It's this way. I'm positive. Let's go!

819
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:11,699
D. T. A. , Frank.

820
01:25:13,705 --> 01:25:17,034
Ain't that what you taught me, man?
D. T. A.

821
01:25:17,205 --> 01:25:19,694
Right on schedule, Frank.

822
01:25:19,905 --> 01:25:22,497
I'm sorry, man.
You were my ticket out of here.

823
01:25:23,071 --> 01:25:25,060
Damn you!

824
01:25:28,905 --> 01:25:33,304
You had me set up the whole time?!

825
01:25:33,505 --> 01:25:38,563
Not the whole time. I got
30 years to go, man. Thirty years.

826
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:42,198
The warden made me a deal.

827
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:45,562
Dumb bastard!

828
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:47,828
They made me a deal, man!
A deal!

829
01:25:48,038 --> 01:25:51,334
We don't make deals
with escaping prisoners.

830
01:25:54,305 --> 01:25:56,827
What the hell are you talking about?

831
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:59,537
- You said if I delivered...
- Shut up.

832
01:25:59,805 --> 01:26:03,294
- You're going back to the population.
- Population?

833
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:06,834
You can't do this to me, warden.
You can't do this.

834
01:26:07,071 --> 01:26:10,162
I snitched him off.
They're gonna kill me. I'm finished.

835
01:26:10,338 --> 01:26:12,201
Tough.

836
01:26:12,572 --> 01:26:16,368
Look, I came through, goddamn it!
We had a deal!

837
01:26:18,704 --> 01:26:21,364
That's enough.
You're gonna kill him.

838
01:26:22,905 --> 01:26:24,098
That's enough.

839
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,470
This is an automatic 10 years, Frank.

840
01:26:33,672 --> 01:26:37,127
It's 10 years for a second
escape attempt.

841
01:26:37,306 --> 01:26:40,965
I knew you'd cross the line. I told
them you were a hard-core criminal.

842
01:26:41,173 --> 01:26:45,367
They'll believe me now.
And you better believe me.

843
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:49,130
You better believe that you'll
be doing hard time here...

844
01:26:49,373 --> 01:26:51,804
... for the rest of your life.

845
01:26:53,139 --> 01:26:55,332
Manly, you know what to do.

846
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:10,529
Some dealmaker.

847
01:27:19,506 --> 01:27:20,766
See...

848
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:23,505
... shit does float, doesn't it?

849
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:25,602
Hey, you know what else?

850
01:27:25,772 --> 01:27:29,966
You don't have to worry about
that psycho hurting your girlfriend.

851
01:27:30,206 --> 01:27:33,638
We decided to keep him in here.
Didn't we, officer?

852
01:27:41,473 --> 01:27:43,439
She's not my type.

853
01:27:47,273 --> 01:27:47,373
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

854
01:27:47,373 --> 01:27:50,168
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

855
01:27:50,406 --> 01:27:54,770
Turn on the steam.
Turn on the fucking steam!

856
01:27:54,972 --> 01:27:56,563
Put him in it.

857
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:58,667
Get him in there.

858
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:07,401
Bring him in here! Come on!

859
01:28:13,174 --> 01:28:15,140
Come on!

860
01:28:23,773 --> 01:28:25,762
Rape this.

861
01:28:28,307 --> 01:28:33,171
My face! My face is burning!
My face!

862
01:28:48,773 --> 01:28:50,534
I'll kill you!

863
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:18,263
School's out, punk.

864
01:30:16,874 --> 01:30:18,464
Frank.

865
01:30:20,507 --> 01:30:23,133
Frank, don't leave me here, man.

866
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:33,270
I'm sorry.

867
01:30:33,974 --> 01:30:35,963
Take me with you.

868
01:30:56,474 --> 01:30:58,702
Let him go, Manly.

869
01:30:58,974 --> 01:31:00,769
Let him go.

870
01:31:09,074 --> 01:31:11,199
What are you gonna do with that?

871
01:31:11,474 --> 01:31:13,134
You okay, Frank?

872
01:31:13,707 --> 01:31:15,536
I'm okay, Dallas.

873
01:31:16,407 --> 01:31:19,532
You can trust me, Frank.
You can trust me.

874
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:22,865
- Put it down, Dallas.
- Put it down.

875
01:31:23,141 --> 01:31:26,800
- I won't hurt you anymore.
- Oh, yeah?

876
01:31:28,908 --> 01:31:32,772
- You don't wanna do it.
- You fat piece of shit.

877
01:31:32,941 --> 01:31:34,305
Don't do it, Dallas.

878
01:31:34,908 --> 01:31:38,466
- What, are you trying to scare me?
- Dallas, don't.

879
01:31:40,176 --> 01:31:43,040
- You won't do it.
- Oh, yeah?

880
01:31:43,342 --> 01:31:47,398
- You don't got the balls to do it, punk.
- You're wrong.

881
01:31:47,575 --> 01:31:50,041
- Stoolie.
- You're wrong.

882
01:31:50,975 --> 01:31:53,032
- Put it down.
- You're wrong!

883
01:31:53,309 --> 01:31:54,706
No!

884
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:16,906
Switch to backup. Sir, we've got
a power outage in C-wing.

885
01:32:17,642 --> 01:32:20,074
Get some men to that utility quarter.

886
01:32:43,775 --> 01:32:47,901
You better have a good reason for not
telling me you knew Leone was escaping.

887
01:32:48,075 --> 01:32:50,802
I've got a dead officer and
a dead inmate.

888
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:53,235
And I don't have any answers.
Do you?

889
01:32:53,408 --> 01:32:56,932
I was trying to save an informant's
life by keeping it secret.

890
01:32:57,109 --> 01:33:01,564
Why would a man who's got
three weeks to go try to break out?

891
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:04,466
We can ask him
when we catch him.

892
01:33:24,509 --> 01:33:28,566
Busted cable, utility corridor.
He's going to the roof.

893
01:34:59,776 --> 01:35:01,799
Bring up zone two.

894
01:35:02,643 --> 01:35:04,541
Can't you get any more light in there?

895
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:06,108
Captain Meissner.

896
01:35:06,277 --> 01:35:08,470
This is Osner.
I'm in the well room.

897
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:10,769
Looks like this is where he went out.

898
01:35:21,577 --> 01:35:24,702
Sir, that has got to be at least
200 yards underwater.

899
01:35:24,911 --> 01:35:28,036
- Do you really think he made it?
- Maybe not, Mr. Braden.

900
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:30,833
But until you bring me a body,
I've got an escaped prisoner.

901
01:35:31,011 --> 01:35:34,000
- This is Drumgoole. I want sector four.
- Meissner, sector four.

902
01:35:34,177 --> 01:35:37,405
- What do you have?
- Right now, nothing, sir.

903
01:35:37,644 --> 01:35:41,008
I'm thinking of calling in the
local and state police.

904
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:45,972
No! No outside agencies.
I repeat, no outside agencies.

905
01:35:46,177 --> 01:35:49,769
This is an internal matter.
He's alive, I want him.

906
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:54,103
- Arm a tactical squad and meet me.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:59,068
Mr. Braden, you will
continue this search.

908
01:36:21,677 --> 01:36:24,075
You won't get away with it.

909
01:36:25,577 --> 01:36:27,406
You know that, don't you?

910
01:36:28,777 --> 01:36:30,970
I could've got out.

911
01:36:32,911 --> 01:36:36,206
But I'm not going to spend my life...

912
01:36:36,477 --> 01:36:40,068
... running from you.

913
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:46,376
Paul, look at this.

914
01:36:49,577 --> 01:36:51,203
Get your ass inside.

915
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:53,467
Whoa, hold it.

916
01:36:54,178 --> 01:36:57,269
- You can't use me as a hostage...
- Shut up! Shut up!

917
01:36:57,511 --> 01:37:00,375
You recognize that chair?

918
01:37:00,645 --> 01:37:04,907
You built it, didn't you?
Now get in there. Get in there!

919
01:37:05,144 --> 01:37:07,406
Don't even think about moving.

920
01:37:10,411 --> 01:37:14,707
You think you're gonna take me
to hell, huh? I'll show you hell!

921
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:18,867
All right, over there.

922
01:37:19,378 --> 01:37:21,173
Move your leg!

923
01:37:21,478 --> 01:37:25,774
Dallas, he fried,
the way you're gonna fry.

924
01:37:27,211 --> 01:37:32,405
First Base, you took him downstairs,
you broke his goddamn neck!

925
01:37:34,978 --> 01:37:39,967
I'm gonna fry your brains.
What do you know? It's a perfect fit.

926
01:37:40,845 --> 01:37:42,834
Move! Move!

927
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:48,744
You can't make this work.
You're not smart enough. You're stupid.

928
01:37:48,912 --> 01:37:50,343
You're scum.

929
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:53,477
Shut up! I'll show you scum.

930
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:58,473
You can't kill a man. You're not
a murderer. You don't have the guts.

931
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:07,208
Ten more years.
Isn't that what you said?

932
01:38:08,144 --> 01:38:09,906
How about 20?

933
01:38:10,378 --> 01:38:11,810
How about 30?

934
01:38:12,077 --> 01:38:16,567
No, it doesn't matter what they give
me because you won't be satisfied...

935
01:38:16,845 --> 01:38:18,208
... till you got me for life.

936
01:38:18,378 --> 01:38:20,367
Make a hole.

937
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:22,201
Take it down!

938
01:38:24,578 --> 01:38:26,771
I ain't doing life for nothing.

939
01:38:28,044 --> 01:38:30,272
Come on. Lean on it, man!

940
01:38:30,478 --> 01:38:33,308
They're gonna break that door down.

941
01:38:33,545 --> 01:38:36,410
And they're going to take
your skull apart!

942
01:38:36,579 --> 01:38:39,636
You're going to beg me
to let them kill you.

943
01:38:40,012 --> 01:38:42,410
- Come on, break it down!
- Meissner!

944
01:38:43,913 --> 01:38:45,969
Harder, man. Harder!

945
01:38:50,012 --> 01:38:52,205
Come on, lean on it.

946
01:38:52,712 --> 01:38:54,302
No!

947
01:38:56,145 --> 01:38:57,702
No!

948
01:38:59,813 --> 01:39:01,369
Take out the glass!

949
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:06,636
Shoot! Shoot me!

950
01:39:06,813 --> 01:39:08,278
- Don't shoot!
- Shoot!

951
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:10,911
He has his hand taped to the lever.

952
01:39:11,379 --> 01:39:12,845
No!

953
01:39:13,345 --> 01:39:17,368
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

954
01:39:17,546 --> 01:39:18,876
Come on, shoot!

955
01:39:21,312 --> 01:39:22,869
Hold your fire!

956
01:39:25,846 --> 01:39:28,471
Relax. Just relax.

957
01:39:29,312 --> 01:39:32,710
Glad you're here, Meissner. This
wouldn't be official without witnesses.

958
01:39:32,879 --> 01:39:37,868
He's bluffing. He's wants me to take
responsibility for his escape attempt.

959
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:41,873
I don't want a confession.
You set me up. You set everything up!

960
01:39:42,045 --> 01:39:46,375
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Chink Weber!

961
01:39:46,579 --> 01:39:48,272
The goons.

962
01:39:48,712 --> 01:39:51,576
The cop that was gonna rape Melissa.

963
01:39:52,379 --> 01:39:53,675
Dallas.

964
01:39:54,646 --> 01:39:57,009
The killing of the kid.

965
01:39:58,145 --> 01:40:00,134
Guilty on all counts.

966
01:40:00,312 --> 01:40:05,472
Prove it! That's your problem.
You can't prove anything.

967
01:40:05,646 --> 01:40:10,203
I don't have to prove nothing.
I came here for an execution.

968
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:13,675
I demand to be released from here!

969
01:40:14,712 --> 01:40:16,143
No!

970
01:40:16,312 --> 01:40:20,769
Don't do it, Leone. Don't do it.
Take it easy.

971
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,776
You deserve payback.

972
01:40:24,979 --> 01:40:26,377
Frank!

973
01:40:28,547 --> 01:40:30,536
Please, Frank.

974
01:40:31,814 --> 01:40:35,541
Don't kill me. It's true.

975
01:40:38,547 --> 01:40:42,035
I confess, Mr. Meissner.

976
01:40:42,313 --> 01:40:45,177
Everything that he said was true.

977
01:40:45,413 --> 01:40:48,277
I set him up. Everything.

978
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:53,479
Please.

979
01:40:54,814 --> 01:40:57,006
Don't kill me.

980
01:40:58,513 --> 01:40:59,706
Don't...

981
01:41:00,413 --> 01:41:05,845
See you in hell, Drumgoole.

982
01:41:22,713 --> 01:41:25,144
Works better with this.

983
01:41:27,079 --> 01:41:29,443
Take him to the hole, Mr. Meissner.

984
01:41:29,813 --> 01:41:33,905
Mr. Braden, take the prisoner
to the hole.

985
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:36,009
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

986
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:40,542
Somebody get me
out of this chair.

987
01:41:42,046 --> 01:41:43,478
Come on.

988
01:41:47,913 --> 01:41:52,505
Thank you, Mr. Meissner.
I said take him to the hole.

989
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,509
I can't do that.

990
01:41:55,213 --> 01:41:57,008
Take the warden into custody.

991
01:41:57,213 --> 01:42:00,304
- I said take him. What are you doing?
- Cuff him.

992
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:05,979
Stop it! I am warden of this institution,
and you will obey... Stop that!

993
01:42:06,414 --> 01:42:11,676
That was just a stupid confession to
try and save my life. Are you crazy?

994
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,308
No, but you are.

995
01:42:14,581 --> 01:42:19,707
Until this matter's resolved in a judicial
inquiry, you'll remain in our custody.

996
01:42:22,047 --> 01:42:24,707
I'll have your ass for this.

997
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:28,469
I'll have your ass.

998
01:42:29,514 --> 01:42:31,173
Move him!

999
01:42:42,581 --> 01:42:45,206
I only wanted to do my time, captain.

1000
01:42:45,648 --> 01:42:48,136
You'll get your chance.

1001
01:42:48,314 --> 01:42:50,405
Move him.

1002
01:43:10,214 --> 01:43:12,305
Hey, Ernie.

1003
01:43:12,481 --> 01:43:14,344
Hang in there, Frank.

1004
01:43:14,713 --> 01:43:16,202
Hey, Frank?

1005
01:43:16,381 --> 01:43:18,370
- Eclipse.
- Take care.

1006
01:43:18,548 --> 01:43:21,173
You too. Thanks a lot, big man.

1007
01:43:21,347 --> 01:43:24,541
Yeah. That okay?

1008
01:43:24,713 --> 01:43:26,475
It's all right.

1009
01:43:28,847 --> 01:43:33,644
Got this one from
Fidel Castro himself.

1010
01:43:35,847 --> 01:43:38,507
- See you, big man.
- Okay.

1011
01:43:58,515 --> 01:44:00,413
Hold it.

1012
01:44:00,714 --> 01:44:03,545
Crack the outside!

1013
01:44:04,415 --> 01:44:08,279
- Know what I'll miss most about you?
- What's that?

1014
01:44:09,148 --> 01:44:11,909
Your incredible smile.

1015
01:44:23,282 --> 01:44:27,146
- Take care of yourself, Leone.
- Thanks, captain.

1016
01:44:38,515 --> 01:44:39,673
Lock 'em!
