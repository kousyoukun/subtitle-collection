00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,792
他和其他2000名囚犯在这里。。。
he's here with 2000 other inmates...

273
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,459
剩下的我一点也不在乎！
I don't give a damn about the rest!

274
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,542
我想知道 关于里昂和我。。。
I want to know about Leone and I...

275
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,042
冷静点，小姐。
Calm down, Miss.

276
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,875
利昂没事。
Leone is alright.

277
00:25:57,459 --> 00:26:00,500
他是个模范囚犯。 你为什么带他来这里？
He was a model prisoner. Why did you bring him here?

278
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,334
例行转移。
Routine transfer.

279
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:19,334
这里很热。
It's hot in here.

280
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,000
我知道。但至少很容易。
I know. But at least it's easy.

281
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,750
我知道，伙计，对不起。 我做得不太好。
I know, man, I'm sorry. I didn't do too well.

282
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,542
跟我走，我要带你去看 一些东西。这很重要。
Walk with me, I have to show you something. It's important.

283
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:32,334
-不，你试试看。 -不，来吧。
- No, here, you try. - No, come on.

284
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,542
-你会喜欢的。 -我不喜欢艰苦的劳动。
- You'll like it. - I'm not into hard labor.

285
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,375
很酷，很简单。
It's cool, it's easy.

286
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:40,500
我累坏了。来吧，伙计。
I'm burnt out. Come on, man.

287
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,542
你会喜欢的。
You're gonna love this.

288
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,167
小心点，弗兰克。
Watch the steam, Frank.

289
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:56,459
我是从一个老受托人那里弄来的 水暖工。他们说他是个疯子。
I got these off an old trustee plumber. They said he was a nut.

290
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,500
这并不意味着他不聪明。
That doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

291
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:01,834
-快点。 -好吧。
- Hurry up. - Alright.

292
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:06,584
有隧道 在每个牢房下面。
There are tunnels under every cell block.

293
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,542
它们通向蒸汽厂。
They lead to the steam plant.

294
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:11,250
我穿过蒸汽管道出去。
I go out across the steam lines.

295
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:14,167
我要在蒸汽管道上晃来晃去
I'll shimmy across the steam pipes

296
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,292
去萨莉港。
to the sally port.

297
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,792
卡车来来往往。 我在等我的时间。。。
There are trucks coming and going. I wait for my time...

298
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:25,417
我在一辆要离开的卡车上。 我要离开达拉斯了。
and I am on a truck that's leaving. I'm dearly departing Dallas.

299
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,000
我让你睡不着吗？ 你是医生，
Am I keeping you awake? You're the doctor,

300
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,542
我想听听你的意见。
I want your opinion.

301
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,209
让我们向后看。
Let's run it backwards.

302
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,542
我看到这些卡车， 他们大约九点停止跑步。
I see these trucks, they stop running at about 9.

303
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:42,625
在9点，大部分警卫都完成了 所有的囚犯都醒了。
At 9 most of the guards complete and all the inmates are awake.

304
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:46,042
所以在你走10英尺之前， 这里的每个骗子都会知道的。
So before you go ten feet, every con here will know it.

305
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:48,417
还有这个。。。希米？
And this... shimmy?

306
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,584
闪烁的幻灯片。
Shimmy slide.

307
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:57,000
你要摇摇晃晃地溜过去 150°时200码的蒸汽管？
You're going to shimmy slide across 200 yards of steam pipe at 150°?

308
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:01,417
离开达拉斯 会变成油炸达拉斯。
Departing Dallas will become Deep Fried Dallas.

309
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,667
-只是一个想法。 -这才是最重要的。
- It was just a thought. - That's what counts.

310
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,500
我要赶飞机。 谢谢。
I've got a plane to catch. Thanks a lot.

311
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,709
达拉斯？
Dallas?

312
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,834
你有烟吗？
You got a cigarette?

313
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:21,750
这是我最后一个。 给，把它做完。
This is my last one. Here, finish that.

314
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,792
不多， 但思想才是最重要的。
It's not much, but it's the thought that counts.

315
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,917
最后一次呼叫食堂！
Last call for the mess hall!

316
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,459
看起来像垃圾炖肉，
Looks like garbage stew,

317
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:59,334
就像妈妈以前做的那样。 所以我才杀了她。
like mom used to make. That's why I shot her.

318
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,917
-我能再来点肉汁吗？ -肉汁？
- Can I have some more gravy? - Gravy?

319
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,709
你要肉汁吗？
You want some gravy?

320
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,750
-这是一些肉汁。 -我的食物上都是。
- Here's some gravy. - It's all over my food.

321
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,167
快走！
Move it!

322
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,125
-他在干什么？ -谋杀。
- What's he in for? - Murder.

323
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:19,500
他只是在错误的地方 在错误的时间。
He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

324
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:24,584
他在车里等着 巴迪去喝啤酒了。轰隆隆！
He waited in the car while his buddy went for beer. Boom boom!

325
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,417
两个人死了。 那孩子现在在做那个大婊子。
Two guys dead. The kid's doing the big bitch now.

326
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:28,959
双重生活。
Double life.

327
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,167
他会假释的 当他大约400岁的时候。
He'll make parole when he's about 400.

328
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,875
快走！
Move it!

329
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,709
你学习慢还是怎么了？
Are you a slow study or what?

330
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:38,667
算了吧。
Forget it.

331
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,917
我没有机会预订。
I didn't get a chance to reserve.

332
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,084
我们为什么不坐在那边呢。
Why don't we sit over there.

333
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,750
-你在干什么？ -我要这个。
- What are you doing? - I'm taking this.

334

-想吃蛋糕吗？ -出什么事了？

338
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:04,875
我在节食。
I'm on a diet.

339
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:06,625
这个地方有人吗？
Is this spot taken?

340
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,875
你应该打那个肥土包。
You should've hit that fat dirt bag.

341
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,500
闭嘴。他刚刚救了你。

你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

343
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,500
为什么有人需要一个名字 在这样的地方？
Why does anybody need a name in a joint like this?

344
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,667
当你收到邮件时会有帮助。
It helps when you get mail.

345
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,125
我需要一个名字？
I need a name?

346
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:24,959
他们叫我杀手。
They call me Killer.

347
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:29,334
那是原创的。 你自己也这么想吗？
That's original. Did you think that up yourself?

348
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:32,000
我叫自己我想要的，好吗？
I call myself what I want, ok?

349
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,875
杀手，这是达拉斯 我是弗兰克。
Killer, this is Dallas and I'm Frank.

350
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,459
这些应该是什么？
What are these supposed to be?

351
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:43,834
这些可能是豌豆或者 它们可能是有毒废物。
These might be peas or they might be toxic waste.

352
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,084
谁在乎呢？反正都是废话。
Who cares? It's all crap, anyway.

353
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,334
吃你的蔬菜，
Eat your vegetables,

354
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:50,792
-你会变得又大又强壮。 -把蔬菜粘起来。
- you'll grow big and strong. - Stick your vegetables.

355
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:55,542
你知道的 这里还有325个“杀手”。
You know there are about 325 other "Killers" in here.

356
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,042
把你的腿放在过道上。
Put your leg in the aisle.

357
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,834
准备好行动。
Be ready to move.

358
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:03,459
没人告诉我该怎么做。
Nobody tells me what to do.

359
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:34,167
你必须先准备好行动。 你有时间去一垒。
You have to be ready to move first. You have time to get to first base.

360
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:37,959
“一垒”，
"First Base",

361
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,959
他有名字。

362
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,000
在外面真好。

没那么糟。 继续走很好。
It's not that bad. It's good keep moving.

365
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,542
你怎么能保持这种“向上”的态度 在这样的地方？
How can you keep that "up" attitude in a joint like this?

366
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:01,750
这是一种思维定势。
It's a mind set.

367
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:05,292
你的身体必须在这里 但你的大脑不会。
Your body has to be in here but your brain doesn't.

368
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:08,709
继续前进，你就不会变成 这地方的一部分。
Keep moving and you won't become a piece of this place.

369
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,334
那是大师的东西吗？
Is that guru stuff?

370
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:14,459
-也许我应该成为一个大师。 -这是讽刺吗？
- Maybe I should become a guru. - Is that sarcasm?

371
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:16,709
该死的鸟。
Fucking birds.

372
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,042
他们不在雨中吃东西。
They don't eat in the rain.

373
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,209
他们会回来的。
They'll come back.

374
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,000
你能把面包留给我吗 明天
Will you save your bread for me tomorrow?

375
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,834
当然。把它放在你的单子上。
Sure. Put that on your list.

376

谢谢。
Thanks.

377
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,959
你为什么跟疯子说话？ 这是浪费时间。
Why do you talk to crazy? It's a waste of time.

378
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,917
对你来说这是浪费时间。 对他来说，这就是他的全部。
To you it's a waste of time. To him it's all he's got.

379
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:46,209
在这里你有 尊重某物。
In here you have to respect something.

380

你必须保护你所拥有的。

381
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:52,584
你还什么都不知道。 来吧，我们跑吧。
You don't know anything yet. Come on, let's run.

382
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:02,417
我要淋湿了。
I'm gonna get wet.

383
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,375
我给你寄洗衣单。
I'll send you laundry bill.

384
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,500
你感觉到什么了吗，利昂？
Did you feel something, Leone?

385
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,000
你想玩吗？ 我们是矮个子。
Do you want to play? We're a man short.

386
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,834
我在和你说话！
I'm talking to you!

387
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:39,292
嘿，朋克。去涂指甲油 回答“婊子”！
Hey punk. Go paint your nails and answer to "bitch"!

388
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,084
你有一张大嘴巴。闭嘴！
You've got a big mouth. Shut it!

389
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,292
你妈的混蛋！我会撕碎你的。。。
You mother fucker! I'll tear your...

390
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:49,334
你想玩吗？我们会玩的。
You want to play? We'll play.

391
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,875
你说得太多了。我们玩吧。
You talk too much. Let's play.

392
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:54,459
他妈的，我们玩吧。
Goddamn right we'll play.

393
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,084
你和我稍后再玩。
You and I will play later.

394
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,084
把它给他！
Give it to him!

395
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:14,667
你想要更多？ 我们还有更多的给你。
You want more? We have more for you.

396
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,167
呆在那儿！
Stay there!

397
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,834
那是个便宜的机会！
That's a cheap shot!

398
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,375
这不是游戏，伙计。
This isn't a game, man.

399
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,250
这是一个教训。
This is a lesson.

400
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:55,750
-你有话要说吗？ -先下来！
- Do you have something to say? - First down!

401
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:59,000
去你妈的，这是你最后一次了。 你死定了，利昂。
Fuck you, that's your last one. You're dead, Leone.

402
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,917
你不会坚持比赛的！
You won't last the game!

403
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:20,750
进去！
Get in there!

404
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,084

她给我写了一会儿信。

507
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:09,417
然后就停了。 当它击中我的时候：
Then it just stopped. That's when it hit me:
