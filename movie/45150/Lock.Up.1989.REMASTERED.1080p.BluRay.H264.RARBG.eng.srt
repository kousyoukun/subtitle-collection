1
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:29,079
Excuse me?
I'm looking for a mechanic.

2
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:31,749
Is there one here?

3
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,582
Maybe I can help.
What do you need?

4
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,198
It has to be done right away.

5
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,661
You have to know
what you're doing.

6
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,619
I'm not that busy.
What's the matter?

7
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,333
I'm not sure.

8
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,333
Maybe you should check it out.

9
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,953
Maybe I better.

10
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,323
Looks ok from here.

11
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,116
Great customer service.

12
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,790
A little bit of cleaning and paint

13
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,369
and it'll be ready for business.

14
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,995
It's time for me to play
in the super bowl.

15
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,616
The guys will take you apart.

16
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,206
We're gonna do it this time.

17
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,081
Ok, ready?

18
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,458
Turn back!

19
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,292
Here it comes!

20
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,118
Alright!

21
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,241
Suckers walk.

22
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,911
Suckers walk.

23
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,494
What does that mean, Frankie?

24
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,703
It means everything's okay.

25
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,157
How do you think I did?

26
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,415
Pretty good with the six-graders.

27
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,617
You really build me up...

28
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,625
What's the matter?
You don't look too happy today.

29
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,657
I'm missing you already.

30
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,912
- I don't believe you.
- Oh yeah, believe it.

31
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,705
Now that's Italian!

32
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,906
- I have to go.
- No, frank!

33
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:59,122
So I'm not so good against kids?
Should I try a different sport?

34
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,698
Yeah, golf.

35
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,331
Golf?

36
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,124
- Wanna see my swing?
- You in whites...

37
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,953
Like those old guys?

38
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,373
Can you see me on a golf course?

39
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,286
Good thing I've a sense of humor

40
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,665
or I would take that personally.

41
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,075
Time to go to work be good.

42
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,625
Wait a minute.

43
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,914
I've got something for you.

44
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
What's this?

45
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,369
It'll bring you luck.

46
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,750
That's nice.

47
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,073
Thanks.

48
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,414
I could use it.

49
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,074
- How was your time off?
- Great.

50
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,990
Did you see that game?

51
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,704
- I missed it.
- It was awesome.

52
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,833
- Was it really?
- You missed a good one, buddy.

53
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,499
I bet my weekend was better
than yours.

54
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,036
I'll bet it was.

55
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,322
Here you go, Roger.
How's the diesel running, Jimmy?

56
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,870
Forget it. It stops, it stalls.
I don't know what to do with it.

57
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:56,782
- You got water in the fuel line.
- Open.

58
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,407
I'd bet time on it.

59
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,119
- Take it off.
- Alright.

60
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,948
See you later, Jimmy.

61
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,867
- You'll get more starch next time.
- Good.

62
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,913
Say hi to the wife.

63
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,331
How are you?

64
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,582
Frank! What did you bring me?

65
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:18,907
Here. Kill yourself!

66
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,410
What about the girl?

67
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:26,035
I had one for you but the guards
liked her so much they kept her.

68
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,866
I knew it. I can't depend on you.

69
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,996
- Did you check out the garage?
- It's beautiful.

70
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,494
Beautiful? No garage is beautiful.

71
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,118
This one is. It's great.

72
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,908
Can I tell you something?
I'm getting out soon.

73
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,365
I don't come cheap,

74
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:45,989
but I know my way around cars.
If you need help, call me.

75
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,789
I fix them, I don't steal them.

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
I was framed.

77
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,782
What? I was framed.

78
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,285
What's going on?

79
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,831
I don't know but it's official.

80
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,250
Open up cell 210.

81
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,081
On your feet, Leone.

82
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,828
- What do you want?
- Take him.

83
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,782
You're being transferred.

84
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,040
Where? What the hell...

85
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,329
- That's not necessary.
- Step back, officer.

86
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,077
He's in our custody now.

87
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,657
You've got the wrong guy.

88
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,869
Transferred where?

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,367
- Move it.
- What did I do?

90
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,949
Open up! Get in!

91
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,036
What have I done? Damn!

92
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,664
Where are we going?

93
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,115
Talk to me.

94
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,914
Let's go, Leone.

95
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,782
Get his ass out here.

96
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,115
Come on, get out.

97
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,740
- Where are we?
- Shut up.

98
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,078
You made a mistake.

99
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,578
There's no mistake.

100
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,953
Welcome to gateway.

101
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,449
- Drumgoole?
- Warden drumgoole!

102
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,583
- Captain?
- Move him.

103
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,164
One bar of soap and two rolls
of toilet paper a month.

104
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:21,782
If you lose them, you'll wipe
your ass with your shirt.

105
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,167
You have one uniform.

106
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,496
Your number is 510. Remember it!

107
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:32,281
This is c wing. You will eat,
shower and take yard time here.

108
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,658
Miss a count: You're in the hole.

109
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,700
Miss two:
I'll put you in the house of pain.

110
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,660
Convict. Two things.

111
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,040
One: I am meissner.

112
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,663
Two: Never fuck with meissner.

113
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,282
Inside.

114
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,492
- What about the cuffs?
- Let him get used to them.

115
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,993
Officer fryberg, contact 5235.

116
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,458
31.

117
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,161
21. Crack it!

118
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,665
You better not eyeball me, boy.

119
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,165
How were the accommodations
last night?

120
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,365
Like your mama used to do you?

121
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,324
- You did his mama, didn't you?
- Twice.

122
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,165
Open the door! You hear me?

123
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,289
Hello, frank.

124
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:17,281
In the old days the warden
would come from his office,

125
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,703
to this chamber and witness
the putting to death of a criminal.

126
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:28,574
120 men and four women
were electrocuted in that chair.

127
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,206
Beautiful, isn't it?

128
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:35,707
When I came to gateway, I had it
put back into perfect working order

129
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,244
to remind me
of how things ought to be.

130
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,245
It's been five years since
you escaped.

131
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,078
Yes, how time flies.

132
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:49,366
In all the years that I was warden,
you're the only one that made it.

133
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,706
That's what I read in the papers.

134
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,327
Of course you did.

135
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,036
You and your lawyers

136
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,865
did everything to make the news,

137
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,248
the media.

138
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,832
Distorting the truth,

139
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,492
making a criminal into a hero
and the warden into a criminal.

140
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,536
You took my future away from me.

141
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,619
Those bleeding heart politicians
sent you to norwood.

142
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,705
I ended up here in gateway,
the worst shit-hole in the system.

143
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,041
I begged you, drumgoole.
Do you remember that?

144
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:28,451
I had two weeks to go
and all I asked for was one hour

145
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,411
to visit a dying old man.

146
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,161
I was only doing my job.

147
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,366
There's a lot of ways to do it.

148
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:38,989
You could have given me
and escorted leave.

149
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:41,579
- You could've done that.
- You broke the law.

150
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,412
You broke the law
and I was punished.

151
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,786
I got five years. I paid my debt!

152
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,582
To the state, not to me.
But you're going to.

153
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,824
I only have six months left.

154
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,534
That's a lifetime here.
Anything can happen.

155
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:01,118
This is hard time. You have
no rights unless I give them to you.

156
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:04,784
You feel no pleasure
unless I allow it. This is hell.

157
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,744
And I'll give you the guided tour.

158
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:13,532
Ok, tough guy,

159
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,035
open your mouth.

160
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,162
Roll your tongue.
Are you trying to kiss me?

161
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,407
Show me your ears.

162
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,032
What are you looking at, asshole?

163
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,911
- Did you check his nose?
- Yes.

164
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,083
Good.

165
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,744
This is a delousing chamber.

166
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,073
Don't breathe.

167
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,287
The gas can be harmful
to your lungs.

168
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,493
Stand with your legs apart,
arms extended away from your body.

169
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,031
When I tell you, take a deep breath
and hold it for 30 seconds.

170
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,375
Start now.

171
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Ten seconds.

172
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,163
Not yet.

173
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,206
He can take more.

174
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,081
Mr. Braden,

175
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,953
inmates are physically more capable

176
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,328
than you can imagine.

177
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:10,198
If you underestimate them,
it'll cost you dearly.

178
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:01,034
Watch out for the birds.
What are you doing?

179
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,573
I'm sorry.

180
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,907
Billy, get that weight.

181
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,577
Move it, Ace.

182
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,831
That's my spot.

183
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,539
That's my spot too.

184
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,408
Any spot here that isn't yours?
= no.

185
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,910
There're all mine.

186
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,869
If you want one, you gotta pay.

187
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,662
Not so fast, Ace.
I'm not gonna gouge you,

188
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,825
that thing around your neck
will buy a spot

189
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,327
for the day.

190
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,581
I'll put a hole in your heart.

191
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:19,827
Break it up!

192
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,782
Break it up, I said!

193
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,660
Back off!

194
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,119
Drop the weapon.

195
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,907
There's no shank here.

196
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,033
- Come on.
- Mother fucker.

197
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,332
Spread your legs.

198
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,282
You're making a big mistake.

199
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,206
You'll go in the hole for that.

200
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,867
Where's your witness?
Where's your evidence?

201
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,813
- He saw it.
- He didn't see anything.

202
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,410
He saw the shank, right?

203
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,868
I didn't see anything.

204
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,699
You're making a bad mistake, Braden.

205
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,908
Get him the fuck out.

206
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,040
He would have put
that shank in you.

207
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,914
Why are you covering him?

208
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,161
You have your rules
and we have ours.

209
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,535
I know the face,
and I know the name. Hey, frank.

210
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,164
Frank Leone, right.

211
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,326
My name's Dallas. I was in
treadmore, when you busted out.

212
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,623
You were in a block.

213
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,197
Right, I was in a block.
You have a good memory, man.

214
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,617
Treadmore doesn't have an a block.
Watch your feet.

215
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:58,453
I was there on transfer.

216
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,458
Less than two hours,
but I know all about you.

217
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,537
You're looking at a devoted fan.

218
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,990
D.t.a.

219
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,371
D.t.a. Ok. What's that, man?

220
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,493
Don't trust anybody.
Words to survive by. Your feet.

221
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,573
D.t.a.?

222
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,750
D.t.a.

223
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,994
You've got to trust someone.

224
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,783
I'll make it clear.
See this fat tub of shit back here?

225
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
That's manly.

226
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,617
His partner's and wiley.
They're sadistic pigs.

227
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,030
They are only happy
when they are hurting someone.

228
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,576
If the warden wants you down,
he uses them.

229
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,949
And the black dude in the booth

230
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,157
is captain meissner.

231
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,742
He runs the guards.
He's one bad dude, ok?

232
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:49,989
We already met.
I've got to work, move your feet.

233
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,661
Listen frank.

234
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,408
When you decide
to make your break,

235
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,240
and I know you will,

236
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:05,371
you come and talk to me, ok?
You come talk to Dallas.

237
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:11,037
Anything you want or need,
I can get. Ok?

238
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:15,580
- No damn way.
- Come on, eclipse.

239
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:20,206
You're always crying about needing
a man who knows his engines, Holmes.

240
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:25,490
Don't Holmes me. The only thing
you brought here is trouble.

241
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,998
Come on, eclipse.

242
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:32,077
I know all about you. Your thing
with drumgoole won't come in here.

243
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:37,574
The boys have no problems with me
and I have no problems with them.

244
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:48,117
Don't make me look bad.
I promised him a job, you owe me.

245
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:52,365
I don't owe you
or anybody anything. Hey, you!

246
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,323
Get your face out of that motor.

247
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,496
Get your face out of there.
You know nothing about motors.

248
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,869
Get away from it, ok?

249
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,954
It's been a long time
since I last saw a 365 motor block.

250
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,739
Take a good look. That's the
last time you'll see one here.

251
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,830
Frank, we can work this out,
we're all gentlemen here.

252
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,288
That's alright, it's his place.
He knows what he wants.

253
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,535
Thanks a lot,
I appreciate the endorsement.

254
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,157
Hold on.

255
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:32,451
You don't want this job anyway,
greasy fingers and oily clothes.

256
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,957
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

257
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,956
That's what I'm afraid of.

258
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,869
Prison joke: I lost my watch.
Will you help me find it?

259
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:47,249
Get your ass out of here.

260
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,618
You should put on a few pounds.
You look a little frail.

261
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,659
I meant what I said.
I'll get you something good.

262
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,697
Something easy, something cool.

263
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,157
Shut up and get inside.

264
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,499
Here's your shit from norwood,
Leone.

265
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,990
Lock in!

266
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,618
Problem?

267
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,039
No, I have no problems.

268
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,499
- What the hell is going on?
- Look miss,

269
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,790
he's here with 2000 other inmates...

270
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,457
I don't give a damn about the rest!

271
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,536
I want to know
about Leone and I...

272
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,039
Calm down, miss.

273
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,865
Leone is alright.

274
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:00,495
He was a model prisoner.
Why did you bring him here?

275
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,328
Routine transfer.

276
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:19,327
It's hot in here.

277
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,991
I know. But at least it's easy.

278
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,749
I know, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't do too well.

279
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,535
Walk with me, I have to show you
something. It's important.

280
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,324
- No, here, you try.
- No, come on.

281
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,537
You'll like it.
= I'm not into hard labor.

282
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,369
It's cool, it's easy.

283
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:40,499
I'm burnt out. Come on, man.

284
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,536
You're gonna love this.

285
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,164
Watch the steam, frank.

286
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:56,491
I got these off an old trustee
plumber. They said he was a nut.

287
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,494
That doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

288
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,823
- Hurry up.
- Alright.

289
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:06,579
There are tunnels
under every cell block.

290
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,536
They lead to the steam plant.

291
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,245
I go out across the steam lines.

292
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:14,203
I'll shimmy across the steam pipes

293
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,283
to the Sally port.

294
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,788
There are trucks coming and going.
I wait for my time...

295
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:25,405
And I am on a truck that's leaving.
I'm dearly departing Dallas.

296
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,992
Am I keeping you awake?
You're the doctor,

297
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,539
I want your opinion.

298
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,198
Let's run it backwards.

299
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,538
I see these trucks,
they stop running at about 9.

300
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:42,623
At 9 most of the guards complete
and all the inmates are awake.

301
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:46,034
So before you go ten feet,
every con here will know it.

302
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,415
And this... shimmy?

303
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,581
Shimmy slide.

304
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,995
You're going to shimmy slide across
200 yards of steam pipe at 160°?

305
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:01,410
Departing Dallas
will become deep fried Dallas.

306
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,662
- It was just a thought.
- That's what counts.

307
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,495
I've got a plane to catch.
Thanks a lot.

308
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,702
Dallas?

309
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,827
You got a cigarette?

310
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:21,742
This is my last one.
Here, finish that.

311
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,784
It's not much,
but it's the thought that counts.

312
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,905
Last call for the mess hall!

313
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,449
Looks like garbage stew,

314
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:59,330
like mom used to make.
That's why I shot her.

315
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,915
- Can I have some more gravy?
- Gravy?

316
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,782
You want some gravy?

317
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,741
- Here's some gravy.
- It's all over my food.

318
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,167
Move it!

319
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,124
- What's he in for?
- Murder.

320
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:19,489
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

321
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:24,582
He waited in the car while his
buddy went for beer. Boom boom!

322
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,412
Two guys dead.
The kid's doing the big bitch now.

323
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,948
Double life.

324
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,197
He'll make parole
when he's about 400.

325
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,827
Move it!

326
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,704
Are you a slow study or what?

327
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:38,667
Forget it.

328
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,908
I didn't get a chance to reserve.

329
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,074
Why don't we sit over there.

330
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,749
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking this.

331
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:55,240
- Go take something else.
- Are you looking for trouble?

332
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,658
- Want some cake?
- Something wrong?

333
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,375
I'm not hungry.

334
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,616
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

335
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:04,872
I'm on a diet.

336
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,619
Is this spot taken?

337
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,873
You should've hit that fat dirt bag.

338
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,499
Shut up. He just saved you.

339
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,289
What's your name?

340
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:18,496
Why does anybody need a name
in a joint like this?

341
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,657
It helps when you get mail.

342
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,123
I need a name?

343
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,948
They call me killer.

344
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:29,448
That's original.
Did you think that up yourself?

345
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,999
I call myself what I want, ok?

346
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,866
Killer, this is Dallas
and I'm frank.

347
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,457
What are these supposed to be?

348
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:43,831
These might be peas or
they might be toxic waste

349
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,081
who cares? It's all crap, anyway.

350
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,327
Eat your vegetables,

351
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:50,784
- you'll grow big and strong.
- Stick your vegetables.

352
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:55,535
You know there are about
325 other "killers" in here.

353
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,036
Put your leg in the aisle.

354
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,831
Be ready to move.

355
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:03,453
Nobody tells me what to do.

356
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:34,157
You have to be ready to move first.
You have time to get to first base.

357
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:37,952
"First base",

358
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,956
there's a name for him.

359
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:50,998
It's good to be outside.

360
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,208
It's cold outside.

361
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,325
It's not that bad.
It's good keep moving.

362
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,540
How can you keep that "up" attitude
in a joint like this?

363
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:01,743
It's a mindset.

364
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,291
Your body has to be in here
but your brain doesn't.

365
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,700
Keep moving and you won't become
a piece of this place.

366
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,957
Is that guru stuff?

367
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:14,450
- Maybe I should become a guru.
- Is that sarcasm?

368
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:16,698
Fucking birds.

369
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,032
They don't eat in the rain.

370
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,202
They'll come back.

371
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,991
Will you save your bread for me
tomorrow?

372
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,824
Sure. Put that on your list.

373
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:33,702
Thanks.

374
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,947
Why do you talk to crazy?
It's a waste of time.

375
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,914
To you it's a waste of time.
To him it's all he's got.

376
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:46,200
In here you have
to respect something.

377
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,787
You have to protect what you have.

378
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:52,530
You don't know anything yet.
Come on, let's run.

379
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,414
I'm gonna get wet.

380
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,373
I'll send you laundry bill.

381
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,490
Did you feel something, Leone?

382
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,991
Do you want to play?
We're a man short.

383
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,823
I'm talking to you!

384
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:39,281
Hey punk. Go paint your nails
and answer to "bitch"!

385
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,082
You've got a big mouth. Shut it!

386
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,286
You mother fucker! I'll tear your...

387
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,323
You want to play? We'll play.

388
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,874
You talk too much. Let's play.

389
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,448
Goddamn right we'll play.

390
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,082
You and I will play later.

391
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,077
Give it to him!

392
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:14,655
You want more?
We have more for you.

393
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,163
Stay there!

394
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,831
That's a cheap shot!

395
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,365
This isn't a game, man.

396
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,249
This is a lesson.

397
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:55,739
- Do you have something to say?
- First down!

398
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,989
Fuck you, that's your last one.
You're dead, Leone.

399
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,910
You won't last the game!

400
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,744
Get in there!

401
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,410
Hut three.

402
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,743
Don't mix it with us.

403
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,542
Finish him off.

404
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:38,159
Go over there. That's who
you're playing for anyway.

405
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:47,282
What took you so long?

406
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:51,030
You need the help
and I the exercise.

407
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,744
So, call a play.

408
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,083
You're dead!

409
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:12,994
What was that?

410
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,073
The f train, son.

411
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,198
Don't lay down on me.

412
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,956
Come on.

413
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,533
Come on, Leone.
You son of a bitch!

414
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,786
Over the tackle on "two".

415
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,542
Set!

416
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:49,792
You're dead!

417
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:50,958
Hut one.

418
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,458
Two.

419
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,494
Let me through.

420
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,032
Next time I want something,

421
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:57,993
you give it to me.

422
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,905
Move it, the game's over.

423
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,581
You don't listen, do you?

424
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:16,659
Are you ok? Come on.

425
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,575
Put him down.
You're not a doctor.

426
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:22,875
He's on his own. Get inside.

427
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,161
You're a badass, huh?

428
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,081
See you inside, Leone.

429
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,998
You won't break me.

430
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:05,453
Still interested in the job?

431
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,956
Yes, I am.

432
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,790
You know you way
around an engine.

433
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,118
Who taught you?

434
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:36,579
An old man named galleti.

435
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,741
Took me off the streets
when I was 14

436
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:43,000
and kept me off the street corners.

437
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,869
- Where is everybody?
- It's quitting time.

438
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:49,284
We've got the place to ourselves.
Did you break out for him?

439
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,039
Yes, I owed him.

440
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,741
What put you in the joint?

441
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:59,330
One night these punks broke into
the garage and beat up galleti.

442
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,822
The whole neighborhood
knew about it. So did the cops.

443
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,197
The punks were connected
so the cops didn't do anything.

444
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,831
And I did.

445
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,290
These guys ended up in hospital
and I did 18 in treadmore

446
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,786
for aggravated assault.

447
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,782
A little contraband?

448
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,240
Why not?

449
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,745
I see why they call you eclipse.
You're... 6'7?

450
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,074
I block a lot of the sun, don't 1?

451
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,535
Yeah, you do.

452
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:31,575
I had a guy who used to get me
good Havana's.

453
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,450
Not this crap. But someday...

454
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:38,078
- Someday...
- Someday.

455
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:42,579
- That's not bad.
- At least they're cheap.

456
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,491
What are you hiding back there?

457
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,948
That's my baby.

458
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:56,914
Good body work.

459
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:00,246
- This is maybelline.
- Hello maybelline.

460
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,039
This is my baby.

461
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,083
Come on.

462
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,450
1965 Ford mustang, 8 cylinder.

463
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:14,198
225 horse power.
When did you last turn it over?

464
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:19,116
She's been dead for fifteen years.
Nobody could bring her back to life.

465
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:20,782
I'm a body man myself.

466
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,990
Mind if I give it a try?

467
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,785
It's a dead issue, frank.

468
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:29,829
Nothing's dead around here
until it's buried.

469
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,366
Save the headstone.

470
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:16,283
Nothing is dead until it's buried.

471
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,448
Purrs like a kitten!

472
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:27,408
A toast. Let's do the poem.

473
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,866
- What poem?
- The poem, man.

474
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:31,368
The jailhouse poem.

475
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,290
- We wrote it ourselves.
- Excuse me.

476
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:39,871
When we're in a sober mood
we worry, work and think

477
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:42,157
when we're in a drunken mood

478
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,661
we gamble' play and drink

479
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,573
but when our moods are over,

480
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:48,328
when our time has come to pas

481
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:51,123
we hope they bury us upside down

482
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,995
so that the warden can kiss our ass!

483
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:56,873
I like that.

484
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,493
It's catchy.

485
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,866
This is the best.
This is good, man.

486
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,661
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

487
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,494
I wouldn't smoke around it but
it's as good as any dollar around.

488
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,331
Check, please.

489
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,328
When my moods are over and my...

490
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,786
That's not it.

491
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,697
Are you married
or thinking about it?

492
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:32,414
Are you proposing to me?
I'm not married.

493
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,581
Will you when you get out?

494
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,411
That's the plan.

495
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:43,447
You know,
I had this really nice girl.

496
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:47,287
She was nice. And we were in love.

497
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,780
We started talking about
getting married.

498
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,038
She has three brothers,
one percent retarded.

499
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,582
They were being on me.

500
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,329
Some guys don't appreciate romance.

501
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,578
Don't take it personally.

502
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,198
She wrote me for a while.

503
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:09,410
Then it just stopped.
That's when it hit me:

504
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:13,246
I'm never going to be with
a girl again. Or even see one.

505
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:17,030
I'll end up like eclipse
kissing pictures in magazines.

506
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,995
There are so many things
I've never done.

507
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:23,374
I didn't learn how to drive.

508
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,083
What?

509
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,457
I never learned to drive.

510
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:32,789
I hope we don't get
a speeding ticket,

511
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,869
I'd hate to end up in jail.

512
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:39,698
Look wise guy, do you want
to learn to drive or not?

513
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,118
Cut it sharp.

514
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:44,948
That's it.

515
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,953
Now, left into 42nd street.

516
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,285
We'll go to Broadway

517
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,413
- and check out the action.
- What Broadway? We're in a garage.

518
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,583
Come on. Work with me.

519
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,366
You wanna stay here
or check out the action?

520
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,789
I want to check out the action.

521
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,790
- Then left on 42nd street.
- Okay, I got it.

522
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,655
The place is jumping.
Look at the action here!

523
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,789
Check out
those fine-looking ladies!

524
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:15,157
Hey honey, want a ride?

525
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,333
Hey baby.

526
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:19,079
- No reaction.
- They're not your type.

527
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,780
- When were you in Atlantic city?
- I've never been.

528
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:27,660
- What do you think of it?
- Do I like it?

529
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,664
It's the best. The lights...

530
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,117
The boardwalk is jumping,
day and night.

531
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:37,205
There's hot music.
High rollers, parties.

532
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,580
You've got money,

533
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,032
you gamble.

534
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,039
10,000 chorus girls!

535
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,492
Hey honey, feel like a ride
in my new car?

536
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:49,077
That was great.

537
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,956
You're ready for Indianapolis?

538
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:54,702
You got the touch.

539
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,453
Can you do me a favor?

540
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:00,790
Everything was great,

541
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,746
but I would like to hear the engine.

542
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:08,163
If we start the engine
the guards will come in

543
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,824
and we'll all land up in the hole.

544
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,282
Forget it.

545
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:13,994
Just for ten seconds.

546
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:16,408
It will last the rest of my life.

547
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,115
You are a pain in the ass.

548
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,534
Please let me hear that engine.

549
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,660
We built it, man.

550
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,206
Go on. 10 seconds.

551
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:35,743
Looking good.

552
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,333
They're great, huh?

553
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,823
It's beautiful, baby.

554
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,042
Hit it one time.

555
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,125
One more time!

556
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,792
Damn it. Frank!

557
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,452
Kill it, frank, come on.

558
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,490
You did it. Turn it off.

559
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:54,032
Kill it, frank.

560
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:55,956
Come on first, turn it off!

561
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,785
That's right.

562
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:06,040
Turn it off, first.

563
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:09,285
I'm sorry, frank.

564
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:13,202
Get him out of the car!

565
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,490
Stop him!

566
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:18,743
Stop that kid!

567
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,870
First! Stop, you crazy bastard!

568
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:50,792
Stop that car!

569
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,198
I repeat: Stop that car.

570
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:01,288
They'll kill you!

571
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,282
This is meissner. Stop firing.

572
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,580
The warden said...

573
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,282
I said stop firing!

574
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:17,955
First, turn it off!

575
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,167
Hold it!

576
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:23,989
Look out frank, be careful!

577
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:27,166
Get out of the car.

578
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:31,197
- They'll kill you.
- Did you see that frank?

579
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,206
- Are you crazy?
- It was beautiful!

580
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:34,782
I can drive!

581
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,831
I can drive a car!

582
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:38,828
You're a crazy son-of-a-bitch.

583
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:45,033
Out of the way. Clear the car!

584
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,741
You just got yourself
a trip to the hole.

585
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,700
Leave frank alone!

586
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,286
- Out of the way.
- Move back!

587
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,832
Let him go.
You have the wrong man.

588
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:04,374
Take Leone to the hole. Six weeks.

589
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,323
It wasn't his fault!

590
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:07,542
Save it.

591
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:16,370
I want five inmates.
Give me a bat.

592
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,573
I want to break up this car.

593
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:20,202
Hold him right there!

594
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,744
I want you to watch this, Leone.

595
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,661
To the honeymoon suite!

596
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,368
Good night.

597
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:51,830
- You should have been notified.
- Why is he in isolation?

598
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I can't tell you.

599
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:56,871
Then I want to see the warden!

600
00:54:57,667 --> 00:54:58,782
Not today.

601
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:05,207
When the light comes on, stand up
and state you name and number.

602
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,368
Name and number!

603
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,865
Leone, 510.

604
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,702
Face the camera.

605
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,706
Name and number.

606
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,490
Leone, 510.

607
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,868
Name and number.

608
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:36,032
Leone, 510.

609
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:43,583
Name and number.

610
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:52,208
Leone, 510.

611
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,289
On your feet. Name and number.

612
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:07,246
Give Mr. Leone half rations
for the rest of his time here.

613
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,208
Name and number.

614
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:20,743
Get up!

615
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:23,289
He seems a little sluggish.

616
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:25,417
Wake him up.

617
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,250
Cold enough?

618
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:50,074
Wanna see my swing?
= you in whites...

619
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:51,292
Like this?

620
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:57,281
Can you see me on a golf course?

621
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,157
Leone 510.

622
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,081
Upright. Name and number.

623
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,619
Leone, 510.

624
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:17,999
You'll pray to have some time alone.

625
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,157
I don't think so.

626
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:23,408
Trust me'l know about these things.

627
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:26,453
Leone 510.

628
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:28,573
I need water.

629
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:38,077
Leone 510.

630
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,164
Name and number.

631
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,866
Marilyn Monroe.

632
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:51,330
37... something.

633
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:53,823
35.

634
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,244
Open cell 121.

635
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:13,660
Hey, I didn't mean it!
I didn't say anything!

636
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:28,458
That's enough.

637
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:47,165
- Who ordered this?
- The warden.

638
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:52,247
Does he hate him enough
to kill him? That's not my job.

639
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:53,702
Mr. sensitive.

640
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,324
He thinks we're too rough
with Leone.

641
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,912
Did you forget who the cops
and the cons are?

642
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:01,573
Be careful!

643
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:03,993
Stop it!

644
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,494
Your stick, Mr. Braden.

645
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:19,535
Pussy.

646
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,786
You get the hell out of my sight,

647
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:26,657
before I shine my boots with
your face, you fat piece of shit!

648
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,208
Your time's up.

649
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,373
Remember what I told you.

650
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:08,831
Roll with the system
or it's only going to get harder.

651
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:16,325
And it's getting shorter too.

652
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:36,407
What's new, Mr. Braden?

653
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:40,994
How's the family?

654
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:44,625
How are the jets?

655
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,490
Don't forget to check your bed.

656
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,160
Hey, frank.

657
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,456
Did somebody die in here?

658
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,328
Not a nice welcome home, is it?

659
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:11,117
The engine block is full of sand.

660
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:12,532
That was chink.

661
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,407
What are we going to do?

662
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,785
Forget it.

663
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:21,075
We put all we have into this car.

664
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,582
We can't let chink slide.

665
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,035
Let it go, first base.

666
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:30,119
Aren't you the guy who says
you have to protect what's yours?

667
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:33,955
You watch my back
and I'll watch yours?

668
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:38,414
I guess that was just jive
now that you're a short-timer.

669
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:40,206
You're incredible.

670
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:44,447
Did you think that is your car?

671
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:46,782
This is the warden's car.

672
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,787
Do you think chink weber did this?

673
01:02:50,542 --> 01:02:52,203
Drumgoole did this.

674
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:53,660
Did you think that

675
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:58,702
we would take our dates out with it?

676
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,160
Rotate it on weekends?

677
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:02,824
Ernie, you take it on Friday, Dallas

678
01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:04,828
on Saturday. And eclipse,

679
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:08,330
you got it Sunday.
Is that what you thought?

680
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:13,244
It's his! This lift, the tools,
the whole garage is his!

681
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:15,874
The whole goddamn place is his!

682
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:23,447
Remember that. Once you start
buying into the "our car" concept,

683
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,115
you're his too.

684
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:35,498
Just let it go.

685
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:39,706
I thought you were our leader.

686
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:42,033
I'm not your leader!

687
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:45,496
This isn't a gang!
We are convicts,

688
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,289
we're prisoners, we're inmates.

689
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,788
As long as we're here,
we'll stay his.

690
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,032
We're his.

691
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,203
Nothing will change that.

692
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,081
You've got to face the facts.

693
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,866
You guys will stay,
ho doubt about it.

694
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,873
In 3 weeks I'm walking.

695
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,495
Nothing will change that.

696
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,240
That's all I care about.

697
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,782
Nothing for nothing, man.

698
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:29,327
He's right.

699
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:44,784
Leone,
how do you like my belt buckle?

700
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:47,073
I like it too.

701
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,703
A little souvenir of you.

702
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:53,947
What are you going to do about it?

703
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:03,787
You mean six weeks in the hole
killed your guts and your appetite?

704
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:09,825
It ain't over, you son-of-a-bitch.

705
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:24,740
Anyone call this spot?

706
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,574
You guys made a reservation.

707
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,706
Are you on a diet?

708
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,411
Cutting back a little.

709
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:36,124
Here, take some of mine.

710
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:37,873
Here's some bread.

711
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:41,034
- Thanks.
- Tomatoes, celery.

712
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,869
I'm not playing football.

713
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,825
Don't worry about that guy.

714
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:49,034
He's in for life.
You only have a few weeks to go.

715
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:53,155
It's a miracle, first base
finally learned something.

716
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,366
- Who's gonna say grace?
- Grace.

717
01:05:58,542 --> 01:06:00,783
She was terrific wasn't she?

718
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,498
I wanted to rely on you, weber.

719
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:06,248
He won't be pushed.

720
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:09,245
Because you're not pushing
in the right place.

721
01:06:09,917 --> 01:06:12,203
Everyone has a weak spot.

722
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:14,456
Find his

723
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,579
or I'll have to find
a new yard boss.

724
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:22,953
Welcome to the gateway races!

725
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:25,874
Let's start the race.

726
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,368
What's your bug's name?

727
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,750
Dirt creature.

728
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:30,532
Three to two on it.

729
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,536
- What's yours called?
- Rear entry.

730
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:34,958
Place your bets.

731
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:37,499
Two will get you three
and five, four.

732
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,324
Everything I got on dirt creature.

733
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,828
The house on rear entry.

734
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:50,739
All bets are in.
Gentlemen, start your insects.

735
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,789
I need a win.

736
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:07,914
You can't do that.

737
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:09,615
The stewards have to decide.

738
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:11,448
You can't push your bug.

739
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,703
Victory by rear end.

740
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,789
We're gonna rerun the race.

741
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,619
- What are you doing down there?
- Shit.

742
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:24,537
Penja, you're on the wrong detail.

743
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,536
Get your ass up here.

744
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,956
Clean up the gym.

745
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,829
We've got to rematch race later.

746
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:34,079
I'm getting out of here.
All bets are off.

747
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:35,532
Now, asshole!

748
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:39,864
Give me a break.
I have to put my jacket on.

749
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,206
Watch my bug.

750
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:45,580
I'll take care of it for you.
Delicious.

751
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:47,163
Do it today.

752
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:11,245
- Clean this place up.
- It's already clean.

753
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:13,703
- Are you deaf?
- Shut your mouth and do it.

754
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:02,578
Come on, one by one.

755
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:23,033
Get him down. Hold his head.

756
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:28,828
I told you we'd play later.

757
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:46,824
- They got first!
- I can't hear you!

758
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:53,159
- What's up?
- They got first base in the gym.

759
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,742
- Again.
- They got first base in the gym.

760
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:14,875
First!

761
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,748
Let me have it.

762
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:46,248
20 years old.

763
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:50,871
The kid's 20 years old.
I told you.

764
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:54,618
I know.

765
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,411
You want me, you got me.

766
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,244
You want me, you fucking Nazi.

767
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:14,124
You got me.

768
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:44,333
No.

769
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,039
I'll kill you!

770
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:54,577
Fight!

771
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,455
Get him!

772
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:44,375
I'll kill you!

773
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:48,323
You son-of-a-bitch!

774
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,706
I'll kill you!

775
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:11,288
Finish him off!

776
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,708
Do it!

777
01:14:32,917 --> 01:14:34,157
Crush his face!

778
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:39,952
Go on! Drop it!

779
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,125
Linen run.

780
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,916
Get a move on,
I'm trying to make a living.

781
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:35,206
Nurse nightingale.

782
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:37,282
How are you?

783
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,785
Alright.

784
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,742
- You're out in three weeks.
- Seems like three years.

785
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:45,499
Three weeks is a blink!

786
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:49,827
What did they do with the kid?

787
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,536
They sent him home.

788
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:03,240
The kid told me once:

789
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:05,664
Your body has to be in prison

790
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,957
but your mind can be
wherever it wants.

791
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:11,327
He told you that?

792
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,699
Yeah.

793
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:19,039
I brought you some toilet paper

794
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:23,664
in case you want to write
some poetry or something.

795
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:28,280
Colonel klink.
Let me out of here.

796
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:36,203
It wasn't your fault, ok?

797
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:38,498
Remember that.

798
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:52,578
Roberta, have Ms. lowell
photograph for an ID.

799
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:55,617
I'm reinstating
Mr. Leone's privileges.

800
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,074
I want to make sure
frank is alright.

801
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,411
He's recovering nicely.

802
01:17:02,042 --> 01:17:06,331
In 3 weeks he'll be out of here and
you'll have a happy life together.

803
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,865
Thanks for coming.

804
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:09,282
Thank you, warden.

805
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:17,368
Look into the light.

806
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,750
Hi, baby.

807
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:28,990
Hi.

808
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:32,243
How are you?

809
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,365
- I was worried.
- You look great.

810
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:39,200
30 minute visit.
Compliments of the warden.

811
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:41,703
- Don't waste it.
- How do you feel?

812
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:43,828
Pretty good, thanks, sweetheart.

813
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:45,455
30 minutes.

814
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:48,784
If you need any help,
give us a call.

815
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:57,698
- Are they all like that?
- Forget it. You look great.

816
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,616
Don't tell me what I look like.

817
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:04,828
I missed you so much.

818
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:17,375
No more separations. Promise?

819
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:19,748
Promise.

820
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:39,703
- Time is up.
- Nice...

821
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,660
What wrong with you?

822
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,035
Time's up.

823
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,990
The warden said half an hour.

824
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:46,539
The warden changed his mind.

825
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:50,537
What do you mean?
I want to talk to the warden.

826
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:53,370
You want is to do
is keep your mouth shut,

827
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:55,539
fix your clothes and get out.

828
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:56,990
Come on.

829
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:58,323
Don't touch her.

830
01:18:58,958 --> 01:18:59,993
What did you say?

831
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:01,583
Don't touch her?

832
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:03,823
You don't learn!

833
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,285
I'm leaving.

834
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:45,202
Come here.

835
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:52,990
Do I know you?

836
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:56,364
No, but I know you.

837
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,115
I was at treadmore.

838
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:02,333
A block?

839
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,115
Treadmore doesn't have an a block.

840
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,660
That's right.

841
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:10,540
- We have something in common.
- What's that?

842
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:13,623
We're both getting out soon.

843
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:17,080
You in a few weeks,
and me the day after tomorrow.

844
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,288
What happened?

845
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:22,782
One beating too many.

846
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:27,784
I've had a hard time here.
We both have, haven't we?

847
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,081
You're right about that.

848
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,957
Can I get you anything
when I get out?

849
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,365
No, I'm alright.

850
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,823
I'm just lucky, I guess.

851
01:20:43,667 --> 01:20:49,037
I have a job lined up.
It pays a grand for two hours' work.

852
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,865
Not bad, eh?

853
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:52,865
What do you have to do?

854
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:00,243
Rape this bitch.
I get an extra 100

855
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:01,458
for every scream.

856
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:02,618
I'll kill you!

857
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:07,406
- Chink says hello.
- You touch her, you're dead.

858
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:09,081
Guard!

859
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,828
Manly!

860
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:14,748
Guard!

861
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:18,074
- What's your problem?
- I need to use the phone.

862
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:20,032
You know you can't.

863
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,366
The guy is gonna kill my girlfriend!

864
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:24,702
What guy?

865
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:27,082
The guy in the wheelchair!

866
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:30,739
- I've got to warn her!
- The wheelchair is empty.

867
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:34,371
Don't play with me, manly.
I have to warn her.

868
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:38,280
Everybody's got problems, Leone.
Get some sleep.

869
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:42,117
God damn!

870
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:51,454
Doing some spring cleaning?

871
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:55,991
Dallas, come here!

872
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,123
What is it?

873
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:04,702
I need some help.

874
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:06,998
No questions asked.

875
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:13,830
You're busting out?
You only have three weeks to go.

876
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,160
Just help me.

877
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,494
It will only take a couple of days.

878
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:20,620
- I need it tonight.
- I can't do that.

879
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,164
When I finish it's all locked.

880
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:23,789
Listen to me.

881
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:28,156
Chink has paid a convict off
to get Melissa.

882
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:33,453
I'd love to help but I can't do
the impossible. You're hurting me.

883
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:42,623
I'll take you with me.

884
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,160
No shit?

885
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:49,625
What's the plan?

886
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:51,368
You'll know when you have to.

887
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:55,540
You're taking the tunnels.

888
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,157
Just be here, alright?

889
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,161
Convict, move out of there.

890
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:05,332
Use some bleach on that.

891
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,707
I'm coming out, colonel.

892
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:13,077
Linen run.

893
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:14,657
How are you?

894
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:18,246
You're late. Get it done.

895
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:21,489
- Yes sir.
- Do you still make that jail-booze?

896
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:25,865
Absolutely not. I've joined
the alcoholics unanimous.

897
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,782
You talk some shit, man.

898
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:31,030
It's bad for my nervous system.
It makes me talk too much.

899
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:32,208
Hurry up.

900
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:34,745
I'll be right out.

901
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,491
No! Help!

902
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:56,161
Come on. Let's go.

903
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:02,908
We've got ten minutes.

904
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:04,948
Sweet dreams, Moby dick.

905
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,583
Come on!

906
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:08,910
The tools, man.

907
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:24,410
You got it.

908
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,243
Here I go.

909
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,331
Oh god, I'm jumping.

910
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:37,829
There are rats in here, frank.

911
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:51,417
No!

912
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:53,949
This way to the steam plant.

913
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,250
It's this way.

914
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:57,164
I remember the map, it's this way.

915
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,866
I'm positive. Let's go!

916
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,206
D.t.a., frank.

917
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,039
Is that what you taught me?

918
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,536
Right on schedule.

919
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,995
I'm sorry.
You're my ticket out of here.

920
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,740
Damn you!

921
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:41,827
You had me set up the whole time?

922
01:25:42,042 --> 01:25:47,082
Not the whole time.
I have 30 years to go.

923
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,831
The warden made me a deal.

924
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:54,073
You dumb bastard.

925
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:56,408
He made me a deal!

926
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:57,789
We don't make deals

927
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,831
with escaping prisoners.

928
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:06,072
What are you talking about?
You said if I delivered...

929
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:10,117
Shut up.
You're going back to the population.

930
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,163
Population?
You can't do this to me, warden!

931
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:18,664
I snitched on him.
They'll finish me!

932
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:19,958
Tough.

933
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:24,330
I came through, god damn it!
We had a deal!

934
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,124
That's enough. You'll kill him.

935
01:26:31,292 --> 01:26:32,623
That's enough.

936
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:45,120
You'll get ten years
for a second escape attempt.

937
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:49,788
I knew you'd try. I told them
you were a hard core criminal

938
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:54,030
and they'll believe me now.
And you better believe me.

939
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:59,373
You'll be doing hard time here
for the rest of your life.

940
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:03,623
You know what to do.

941
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,577
Some deal maker.

942
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:30,658
See? Shit does float, doesn't it?

943
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,865
You know what else?

944
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:38,246
Don't worry about that psycho
hurting your bitch girlfriend.

945
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:42,155
We decided to keep him here.
Didn't we, officer?

946
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,948
Not my type.

947
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:58,742
We'll teach you a lesson...
Graduate you with honors.

948
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:02,580
Turn on the steam, mastrone!

949
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:05,949
Put him in.

950
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:14,907
Bring him in here.

951
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:19,375
Push him in, Darrell. Do it!

952
01:28:21,792 --> 01:28:22,827
Do it!

953
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:33,493
Rape this.

954
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,616
My face is burning!

955
01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:26,498
School's out, punk.

956
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:31,662
Frank, don't leave me here.

957
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:41,122
I'm sorry.

958
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:43,743
Take me with you.

959
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,498
Let him go, manly.

960
01:31:17,667 --> 01:31:19,077
What are you going to do?

961
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,661
Are you ok, frank?

962
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:23,657
I'm ok.

963
01:31:25,042 --> 01:31:28,079
You can trust me.

964
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,161
Put it down, Dallas.

965
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:33,118
I won't hurt you anymore.

966
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:34,994
Put it down.

967
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:38,789
You don't wanna do it.

968
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:41,286
You fat piece of shit.

969
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,831
Don't do it, Dallas.

970
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:45,206
Are you trying to scare me?

971
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:46,748
Don't do it!

972
01:31:48,708 --> 01:31:49,823
You won't do it!

973
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:51,498
Oh yeah?

974
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:54,290
You don't have the balls to do it,
punk.

975
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,910
You're wrong.

976
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:57,160
Stoolie.

977
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:58,535
You're wrong.

978
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,161
- Put it down.
- You're wrong!

979
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:22,583
Switch to backup.

980
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:25,415
We have a power outage in c wing.

981
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:27,782
Go to the utility corridor.

982
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:56,164
You better have a good reason not to
tell me about Leone's escape plans.

983
01:32:56,625 --> 01:33:01,745
I have a dead officer and
a dead inmate but no answers!

984
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:05,450
I was saving an informant's life
by keeping it a secret.

985
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:07,828
Why would a man
with 3 weeks to go

986
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,116
try to break out and kill 2 men?

987
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:12,957
We can ask him when we catch him

988
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:35,411
Defect cable
in the utility corridor.

989
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:37,073
He's going onto the roof.

990
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,036
Get more light in there.

991
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:18,868
I'm in the wellroom.
This is where he went out.

992
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:22,495
Check the far bank over there.

993
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:34,831
That's 150 meters under water.
Do you really think he made it?

994
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,448
Until you bring me a body,
I've got an escaped prisoner.

995
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,374
- This is drumgoole. I want sector 4.
- Meissner, sector 4, go.

996
01:35:42,542 --> 01:35:44,157
What do you have?

997
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,789
Right now nothing, sir.

998
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:49,910
I'm thinking of calling the local
and state police.

999
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:54,618
No outside agencies.

1000
01:35:54,792 --> 01:35:56,783
This is an internal matter.

1001
01:35:56,958 --> 01:36:00,121
He's alive. I want him.
Arm a tactical squad

1002
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:01,698
and meet me in my office.

1003
01:36:03,917 --> 01:36:06,875
Mr. Braden,
we will continue this search.

1004
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:32,369
You won't get away with it.

1005
01:36:34,083 --> 01:36:35,948
You know that don't you?

1006
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,536
I could have got out.

1007
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:48,076
But I'm not going to spend my life
running from you.

1008
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:54,698
Paul, look at this.

1009
01:36:58,208 --> 01:37:01,450
Get inside. Pull it!

1010
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:04,748
You can't hold me as a hostage.

1011
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:07,540
Shut up! Do you recognize the chair?

1012
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,912
You built it, didn't you?
Get in there.

1013
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:15,365
Don't think about moving.

1014
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,830
You're gonna take me to hell?
I'll show you hell.

1015
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,448
Move your leg.

1016
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,160
Dallas...

1017
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:33,911
Was fried
the way you're going to fry.

1018
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:39,825
And first base.
You broke his neck!

1019
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:46,164
You'll fry here.

1020
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:48,331
It's a perfect fit.

1021
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:55,540
You can't make this work.

1022
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:57,331
You're too stupid.

1023
01:37:57,542 --> 01:37:58,952
You're scum.

1024
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:01,244
Shut up! I'll show you scum.

1025
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:07,080
You can't kill a man, frank.
You don't have the guts.

1026
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:15,369
10 more years, you said.

1027
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:17,750
How about 207?

1028
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Or 30?

1029
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:22,703
It doesn't matter how much I get.

1030
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:26,790
You won't be satisfied.
You've got me for life.

1031
01:38:27,417 --> 01:38:28,577
Make a hole.

1032
01:38:29,292 --> 01:38:30,498
Take it down.

1033
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:34,539
I'm not doing life for nothing!

1034
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:38,874
Lean on it!

1035
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:40,698
They'll break that door down.

1036
01:38:40,917 --> 01:38:43,203
And when they come in here

1037
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:46,989
they'll break your skull.
You'll beg me to let them kill you.

1038
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:49,948
- Come on!
- Meissner!

1039
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,039
Harder!

1040
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,740
Lean on it!

1041
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:02,292
No!

1042
01:39:04,542 --> 01:39:05,542
No!

1043
01:39:08,417 --> 01:39:09,417
Break the window!

1044
01:39:13,292 --> 01:39:14,372
Shoot me!

1045
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:16,458
Don't shoot!

1046
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:18,198
His hand's taped to it!

1047
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:20,750
No!

1048
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:23,368
Don't shoot!

1049
01:39:23,542 --> 01:39:24,542
Hold your fire.

1050
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:26,083
Hold your fire!

1051
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:27,167
Shoot!

1052
01:39:29,917 --> 01:39:30,917
Hold your fire!

1053
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:35,952
Just relax.

1054
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:41,280
I'm glad you're here.
It's not official without withesses.

1055
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:46,790
He wants me to accept responsibility
for his escape.

1056
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:48,038
I don't want a confession.

1057
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:50,457
You set everything up.

1058
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:52,453
What are you talking about?

1059
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:54,658
I'm talking about chink weber.

1060
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:59,247
The cop that was going
to rape Melissa!

1061
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:02,118
Dallas.

1062
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,831
The killing of the kid.

1063
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:08,748
Guilty on all counts.

1064
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:11,540
Prove it. That's your problem.

1065
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:13,824
You can't prove anything.

1066
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:16,578
I don't have to prove anything.

1067
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:18,786
I'm here for an execution.

1068
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,616
I demand to be released!

1069
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:24,583
No!

1070
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:27,040
Don't do it, Leone!

1071
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:28,990
Take it easy.

1072
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,250
Please, frank.

1073
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,160
Don't kill me.

1074
01:40:43,333 --> 01:40:44,333
It's true.

1075
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,375
I confess.

1076
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:49,413
I confess.

1077
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:53,280
Mr. meissner,
everything that he said was true.

1078
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I set him up.

1079
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:56,375
Everything.

1080
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:01,910
Please.

1081
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,115
Don't kill me.

1082
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:08,240
Don't...

1083
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:13,656
We'll see you in hell, drumgoole.

1084
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:32,953
It works better with this.

1085
01:41:35,792 --> 01:41:38,033
Take him to the hole, Mr. meissner.

1086
01:41:38,417 --> 01:41:39,417
Mr. Braden,

1087
01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:41,289
take the prisoner to the hole!

1088
01:41:42,542 --> 01:41:43,542
Cuff him.

1089
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:47,583
Somebody get me out of this chair.

1090
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:59,905
Thank you, Mr. meissner.
I said take him to the hole.

1091
01:42:01,417 --> 01:42:05,285
I can't do that.
Take the warden into custody.

1092
01:42:06,042 --> 01:42:08,158
I said take him. What are you doing?

1093
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:10,491
- Cuff him.
- Stop it!

1094
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:14,576
I am the warden of this institution
and you will obey... stop that!

1095
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:17,909
That was a stupid confession
to save my life.

1096
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:20,289
Are you crazy, Mr. meissner?

1097
01:42:20,958 --> 01:42:22,494
No, but you are.

1098
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:25,582
Until this matter is resolved,

1099
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,908
you will remain in our custody.

1100
01:42:30,458 --> 01:42:32,244
I'll have your ass for this.

1101
01:42:33,708 --> 01:42:37,530
I'll have your ass.

1102
01:42:38,292 --> 01:42:39,532
Move it!

1103
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:53,787
I only wanted to do my time.

1104
01:42:54,417 --> 01:42:55,782
You'll get the chance.

1105
01:42:57,042 --> 01:42:58,248
Move him.

1106
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:29,447
- Take care of yourself.
- You too. Thanks, big man.

1107
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:32,831
Is that okay?

1108
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:34,497
It's alright.

1109
01:43:37,958 --> 01:43:40,870
I got this one
from fidel Castro himself.

1110
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:45,907
See you, big man.

1111
01:44:07,292 --> 01:44:08,407
Hold it.

1112
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:11,078
Crack the outside.

1113
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:15,286
You know what I'll miss about you?

1114
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:16,917
What's that?

1115
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:19,448
Your incredible smile.

1116
01:44:32,042 --> 01:44:33,748
Take care of yourself, Leone.

1117
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:35,289
Thanks, captain.

1118
01:44:47,333 --> 01:44:48,333
Lock up!
