1
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,746
- Are you a doctor?
- He's an actor.

2
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:30,412
We're very popular with actors.
Have I seen you in anything?

3
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:36,221
I did Hamlet a while back, didn't I?
And then we did The Sandpiper.

4
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:39,762
He's joking. He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves An Albatross,

5
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,933
and a lot of TV commercials.

6
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:46,161
- That's where the money is.
- And the artistic thrills, too.

7
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,401
Seven, Diego.

8
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,377
The smallest apartment was a nine,

9
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:58,846
but they've been broken
into fours, fives and sixes.

10
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:03,420
Seven-E is a four,
originally the back part of a 10.

11
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:05,557
The original dining room
is its living room,

12
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:07,658
another bedroom is the bedroom,

13
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:11,785
and two servants' rooms together
are a dining room or second bedroom.

14
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:16,024
- Do you have children?
- We plan to.

15
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:19,970
We must oil that gate, Diego.

16
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:24,235
This way, please.

17
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:34,910
The previous tenant,
Mrs Gardenia, died a few days ago,

18
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,679
so nothing has been moved yet.

19
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:41,155
Her son says the furniture
could be had for asking.

20
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:46,320
- Did she die in the apartment?
- No, no, no. In a hospital.

21
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:49,194
She'd been in a coma for weeks.

22
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,835
- After you, please.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,497
She was very old,
and passed away without waking.

24
00:03:56,675 --> 00:04:00,133
I'd be grateful to go that way
myself when the time comes.

25
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,115
No, no, no.
Not in the apartment, no.

26
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,345
She was chipper right to the end.

27
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,350
One of the first women lawyers
in New York.

28
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:13,582
- Did a little gardening, too.
- She was quite a woman.

29
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,092
Closet. Oh, plenty of closets.

30
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:25,927
This room
would make a lovely nursery.

31
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:29,904
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper
would brighten it.

32
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:33,476
- What are all these things?
- Herbs, mostly.

33
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:35,340
Nice large bathroom.

34
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:39,075
- Mint, basil.
- Yeah. No marijuana?

35
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,756
The master bedroom.

36
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:54,092
- Oh, yes.
- Back at the hallway again. There.

37
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,534
Oh, Guy!

38
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:03,302
- The fireplace works, of course.
- Great.

39
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:08,175
It's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!

40
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:11,544
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent.

41
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:16,211
We'd raise it if we were allowed.
Apartments with this kind of charm...

42
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:21,057
Why, that's odd.

43
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,468
There's a closet behind
that secretary. I'm sure there is.

44
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:33,298
Yeah. I think you're right.

45
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:39,343
She moved it. It used to be there.

46
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,582
Give me a hand, will you?

47
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:12,841
I see now why she went into a coma.

48
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:17,144
She couldn't have lifted it
by herself. She was 89.

49
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:20,683
Should we open it?
Maybe her son should.

50
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:25,420
I'm authorised to show the apartment.

51
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:30,122
- Well!
- Whatever she locked in got out.

52
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:32,024
Perhaps she
didn't need five closets.

53
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,597
Why cover up her
vacuum cleaner and her towels?

54
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:38,535
I don't suppose we'll ever know.

55
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:41,935
Maybe she was becoming senile.
Anything else?

56
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,938
What about laundry facilities?

57
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:48,512
- It's bigger than the other one.
- Yeah. It's more expensive, too.

58
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:51,305
It's better located.

59
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:54,475
Yeah, I could walk to all
the theatres from here.

60
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:56,712
Guy, let's take it, please?

61
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:59,618
That living room could be...
Oh, please!

62
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,520
We get out of the other lease, OK.

63
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:06,690
I was tempted to write
that you were drug addicts.

64
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:09,992
Instead, I decided to lie
and say you were wonderful.

65
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:13,797
- You're great, Hutch.
- Could I talk you out of it?

66
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:16,839
- He's pulling your leg.
- Indeed I'm not.

67
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,499
That looks great.

68
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:21,942
You know the Bramford had
an unpleasant reputation

69
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,911
around the turn of the century?

70
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:28,576
It's where the Trench sisters
conducted their dietary experiments,

71
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,779
and Keith Kennedy held his parties.

72
00:07:30,956 --> 00:07:33,322
Adrian Marcato lived there, too...

73
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:35,460
- Trench sisters?
- Adrian Marcato?

74
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:38,721
The Trench sisters
were two Victorian ladies.

75
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,263
They cooked and ate young children,
including a niece.

76
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:45,961
- Lovely.
- Marcato practised witchcraft.

77
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:51,074
He made quite a splash by announcing
he'd conjured up the living devil.

78
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:56,044
People attacked and nearly killed him
in the lobby of the Bramford.

79
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:57,442
You're joking?

80
00:07:57,616 --> 00:08:01,950
Later, after the Keith Kennedy
business, the house was half empty.

81
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,424
- I didn't know Marcato lived there.
- And those sisters!

82
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:06,322
- I didn't know Marcato lived there.
- And those sisters!

83
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:09,358
World War II
filled the house up again.

84
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:11,792
- Terrific!
- The house?

85
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,398
- The lamb.
- They called it Black Bramford.

86
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,003
Awful things happen
in every apartment house.

87
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:22,436
This house has a high incidence
of unpleasant happenings.

88
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:27,704
In '59, a dead infant was found,
wrapped in newspaper in the basement.

89
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,181
- You really rouse my appetite.
- Have some more wine.

90
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:14,415
<i>Roman! Bring me in some root beer</i>
<i>when you come! </i>

91
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,286
These are shelves.

92
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:09,511
Let's make love.

93
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:40,227
I think I hear
the Trench sisters chewing.

94
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:53,742
Straight up to the left.

95
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,617
<i>Here in Daytona, Florida, </i>
<i>it's the 250cc 100</i>-<i>mile classic, </i>

96
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:04,729
<i>with Yamaha leading and winning it, </i>
<i>taking seven of the top 10 places. </i>

97
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,889
<i>It's the third straight year</i>
<i>for Yamaha, a clean sweep. </i>

98
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,799
<i>Yamaha is race</i>-<i>bred from champions</i>
<i>with a model for all kinds of riding. </i>

99
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:18,466
<i>You should discover the swingin'</i>
<i>world of Yamaha. Have a ride. </i>

100
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:21,840
- <i>Come on. Get on. </i>
- <i>OK, come on. Let's go. </i>

101
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:29,083
Look!

102
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,657
It's great.

103
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,240
I'm sorry. I thought you were
Victoria Vetri, the actress. Sorry.

104
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,409
That's OK. A lot of people do.
I don't see any resemblance.

105
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:05,522
- Do you know her?
- No.

106
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:09,153
My name's Terry Gionoffrio.

107
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:14,060
Nice to meet you, I'm Rosemary
Woodhouse. We're new tenants.

108
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:18,463
I'm staying with the Castevets.
I'm their guest, since June.

109
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:21,104
Our apartment was the back of yours.

110
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:23,740
You took
the old lady's apartment. Mrs...?

111
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:27,139
- Yeah... Gardenia.
- Gardenia, yeah.

112
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:30,907
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
for her to cook with.

113
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:34,176
- I saw those plants.
- Now she grows her own things.

114
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:37,879
Excuse me, I have to add softener.

115
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:40,524
- What does your husband do?
- He's an actor.

116
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:44,150
- What's his name?
- Guy Woodhouse.

117
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:49,426
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves An
Albatross, and he does a lot of TV.

118
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:53,400
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
I bet I've seen him.

119
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:59,702
- I hate this basement.
- Me, too.

120
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,778
It gives me the creeps.

121
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:04,881
Let's come down together
regular and do our laundry.

122
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,108
That'd be great.

123
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,811
I have a good luck charm.
It might work for both of us.

124
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:14,322
- That's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

125
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,050
Mrs Castevet gave it to me.

126
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:20,186
It's supposed to be good luck.
It's got some stuff inside.

127
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:27,534
I'm not mad about the smell either.
I hope it works.

128
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:30,868
It's beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it.

129
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:35,570
European. The Castevets are the most
wonderful people in the world.

130
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:39,843
- They picked me up off the sidewalk.
- You were sick?

131
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,782
I was starving, on dope
and a lot of other things.

132
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:45,718
I'm like the daughter they never had.

133
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,120
At first,
I thought they wanted me for sex,

134
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:51,160
but they're like real grandparents.

135
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,297
I'm glad there are people like that.

136
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:58,528
You hear so much about apathy, people
who are afraid of getting involved.

137
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:02,729
I'd be dead now without them.
That's a fact. Dead or in jail.

138
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:06,001
You don't have any family
that could help?

139
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,769
A brother in the navy.

140
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:11,382
<i>It's impossible to be 100% sure! </i>

141
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:16,111
<i>If you want my opinion, we shouldn't</i>
<i>tell her! That's my opinion! </i>

142
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,652
That must be the partition.

143
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:22,225
That's the back part of the original
10 with a dining room,

144
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:24,329
and there's a closet here,
and then there's a closet over here.

145
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:26,422
and there's a closet here,
and then there's a closet over here.

146
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:07,164
Stay back, lady!

147
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:17,838
Get back, please.
There's nothing to see.

148
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,575
Get back, will you, please?

149
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,451
- Jesus.
- Get back!

150
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:28,490
- We know her.
- What's her name?

151
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,527
- Terry.
- Terry what?

152
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:35,165
Ro? What was her name again?
Terry what?

153
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,666
I don't remember. An Italian name.

154
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:42,237
She was staying with
some people named Castevet.

155
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:44,170
We got that already.

156
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:48,403
Short and sweet. She stuck it
to the window with a Band-Aid.

157
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,741
- Come on. Get back.
- Theresa Gionoffrio.

158
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:54,078
Move on! Move on!

159
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:57,587
- You knew her?
- Only slightly.

160
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:00,883
- Come on, Ro, baby. Let's go.
- Here they come.

161
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:07,456
- You folks the Castevets?
- We are.

162
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:10,725
You have a Theresa Gionoffrio
living with you?

163
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:13,301
We do. Has there been an accident?

164
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,103
Brace yourself for some bad news.
She's dead. Jumped out of the window.

165
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:21,745
That's not possible! It's a mistake!

166
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:25,314
Artie, you want to let these folks
take a look, please?

167
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,576
I knew this would happen.

168
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,353
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

169
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:36,357
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.

170
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,018
That doesn't mean she killed herself.

171
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,597
She was a happy girl,
no reason for self-destruction.

172
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:47,136
- Must've been cleaning the windows.
- Not at midnight!

173
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:50,638
- Why not? Maybe she was!
- Is that her handwriting?

174
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:55,776
- Yeah.
- Definitely. Absolutely.

175
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:59,348
I'll see this gets back to you
when we're done.

176
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:03,078
I don't believe it. I just
don't believe it. She was so happy.

177
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:07,623
- Who's the next-of-kin?
- She didn't have anybody, only us.

178
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,317
- Didn't she have a brother?
- Did she?

179
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:14,226
- She said so, in the navy.
- It's news to me.

180
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:17,560
- Where is he stationed?
- I don't know.

181
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:21,899
She mentioned him to me in the
laundry room. I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

182
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:24,337
We're in seven-E.

183
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,909
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs Castevet.

184
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:29,774
She seemed so happy and full of...

185
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:33,940
She said wonderful things about you,
how grateful she was.

186
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,176
Thank you.

187
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,015
Know anything else
about this brother?

188
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:41,283
- No, I don't.
- It should be easy to find him.

189
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,393
- I'm so stunned. I'm so sorry.
- It's such a pity.

190
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:47,587
Well, thank you.

191
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:31,572
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything.

192
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:42,714
Don't tell me what Laura-Louise said.

193
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:46,251
If you'd listened
we wouldn't have had to do this!

194
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:50,656
We'd have been set to go now instead
of having to start from scratch!

195
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,625
I told you
not to tell her in advance!

196
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,288
I told you
she wouldn't be open-minded!

197
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:00,428
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,

198
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:02,105
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.

199
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,880
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine. May I come in?

200
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:16,417
Of course. Please do.

201
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:20,318
I came to thank you
for saying those nice things.

202
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:25,785
Poor Terry. We thought we'd failed
her, though her note said we hadn't.

203
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:29,023
You'll never know how helpful
it was in such a shock moment.

204
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:33,192
So I do thank you. Roman does, too.
Roman's my hubby.

205
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:36,373
I'm glad I could help.

206
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:40,271
Well, she was cremated yesterday.
We got to forget and go on.

207
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:42,811
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children. You?

208
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,380
- No.
- Well, there you...

209
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:51,654
That's nice! Look how you put
the table! Isn't that interesting?

210
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:56,260
- I saw it in a magazine.
- Nice paint job.

211
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,921
That's nice. What is that?
The TV room?

212
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:04,226
Only temporarily.
It's going to be a nursery.

213
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,630
- You're pregnant?
- Not yet.

214
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:09,295
I hope to be
as soon as we're settled.

215
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:11,702
You're young,
you ought to have lots.

216
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:15,209
- We plan to have three.
- I'm dying to see the apartment.

217
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,815
- The woman before was a friend.
- Terry told me.

218
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:22,475
Did she? You had some long talks
in the laundry room.

219
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:25,554
- Only one.
- Oh, my goodness!

220
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:28,590
It looks so much brighter.

221
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,728
What do you pay for a chair
like that?

222
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,865
I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.

223
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:40,435
- What does your hubby do?
- He's an actor.

224
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:45,269
I knew it! I said it to Roman
yesterday. He's so good-looking.

225
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:48,037
- What movies was he in?
- No movies.

226
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:51,477
Two plays called Luther
and Nobody Loves An Albatross,

227
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:53,708
and a lot of TV and radio.

228
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:58,913
Rosemary, I got a two-inch thick
sirloin steak defrosting now.

229
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,149
Why don't you and Guy
have supper with us?

230
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,850
- What do you say?
- We couldn't.

231
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:06,929
- Why not?
- No, really, that's very kind...

232
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:12,398
It would be a real help to us.
First night we'll be alone since...

233
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,337
Are you sure it wouldn't
be too much trouble?

234
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,940
Honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask.

235
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:21,272
All right, count on us.
I'll check with Guy.

236
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,778
You tell him
I won't take no for an answer!

237
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:28,976
- Here's your mail! Oh, ads.
- Thank you.

238
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,738
Donald Baumgart got that part.

239
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:12,687
It's a bad play, anyway.

240
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:16,958
Even if it folds out of town it's
the kind of part that gets noticed.

241
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:28,444
Mrs Castevet was here, to thank me
for what I said about Terry.

242
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,479
She is the nosiest
person I've ever seen.

243
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:34,345
You know,
she asked the prices of things?

244
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:40,013
- No kidding.
- She invited us for dinner tonight.

245
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:43,217
I told her I'd have to check with
you, but it would probably be OK.

246
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:48,354
- Jesus! We don't have to, do we?
- I think they're lonely.

247
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:51,433
We get friendly with them
and we'll never get rid of them.

248
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:56,301
- They're right across the wall.
- I told her she could count on us.

249
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,504
You don't have to sulk about it.

250
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:03,704
I'm not sulking.
I see exactly what you mean.

251
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:06,873
- Hell, we'll go.
- No, no. What for?

252
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:10,748
- We'll go!
- No. Not if you don't want to.

253
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:15,221
That sounds so phoney,
but I really mean it. Really, I do.

254
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:17,827
Be my good deed for the day.

255
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,389
OK, but only if you want to.

256
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,468
And we'll make it clear that it's
just for this one night, all right?

257
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:29,105
Perfect timing! Come in.

258
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:33,766
Roman's fixing some vodka blushes.
I'm glad you could come, Guy.

259
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:36,504
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

260
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:39,980
Dinner isn't ready just yet
but sit down there.

261
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,051
Take a seat on the couch.
You'll be very...

262
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:45,086
I seem to have
overfilled the glasses.

263
00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:46,621
No, no, no. Don't get up.

264
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:50,056
Generally, I pour these precise,
don't l, Minnie?

265
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,455
Watch the carpet.

266
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:56,999
But I've made too much, and rather...
There we are. No, sit down.

267
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:59,102
- Mrs Woodhouse...
- Thank you.

268
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,603
- Mr Woodhouse, vodka blush?
- Yes, thanks.

269
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:05,606
- Have you ever tasted one?
- No, I haven't.

270
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:09,439
- It looks delicious.
- They're popular in Australia.

271
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:14,141
- Now, welcome to our home!
- Cheers.

272
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:21,188
- The carpet!
- Oh, dear.

273
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:26,455
Brand-new carpet.
This man is so clumsy!

274
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:31,499
- Do you come from Australia?
- No, from here in New York.

275
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,036
I've been there, though.
I've been everywhere.

276
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:39,165
You name a place and I've been there.
Go ahead, name a place.

277
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:43,211
- Fairbanks, Alaska!
- I've been there, all over Alaska...

278
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,544
Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

279
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:50,482
- Went there in '38...
- Where are you from?

280
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:54,522
- Well...
- From Omaha. Guy's from Baltimore.

281
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:59,061
- They're good cities.
- Do you travel for business?

282
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:04,826
Both. I'm 79, and I've been going
one place or another since I was 10.

283
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:06,400
I've been everywhere.

284
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,232
Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks.

285
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,572
Roman, take your pill!

286
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:16,235
No Pope visits a city
where the newspapers are on strike.

287
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:18,938
I heard he's going to wait
till it's over.

288
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:21,277
That's showbiz.

289
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,587
That's exactly what it is. All the
costumes, rituals-all religions.

290
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:30,886
- We're offending Rosemary.
- No, no.

291
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:36,294
- Are you religious, my dear?
- I was brought up a Catholic.

292
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,765
- You looked uncomfortable.
- He is the Pope.

293
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:44,101
You don't have to respect him
because he pretends he's holy.

294
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:45,333
That's a good point.

295
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:48,842
What they spend on robes and jewels!

296
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:52,881
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organised religion

297
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,613
was given in Luther. Did you ever
get to play that leading part, Guy?

298
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:01,087
Weren't you
Albert Finney's understudy?

299
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:03,183
- No.
- That's strange.

300
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,487
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made

301
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:08,496
and checking to see who you were.

302
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:14,069
- What gesture was that?
- I'm not sure, it was a reaction...

303
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:17,401
I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

304
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:20,476
- It was a kind of involuntary reach.
- That's it!

305
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:24,740
- It had a wonderful authenticity.
- Come on.

306
00:27:24,915 --> 00:27:29,716
No, I mean it.
My father was a theatrical producer.

307
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,878
My early years
were spent in the company

308
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:34,752
of Mrs Fiske,
Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.

309
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:37,291
- Guy?
- Yes, please.

310
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:43,422
You have an interesting inner
quality. It's in your TV work, too.

311
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:45,125
It should take you a long way,

312
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:49,170
provided
you get those initial breaks.

313
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,778
- Are you preparing for a show now?
- I'm up for a couple of parts.

314
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:57,937
- I can't believe you won't get them.
- I can.

315
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:01,875
I'd like to have
a spice garden some day.

316
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:04,043
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.

317
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:07,988
- You come from a big family?
- Three brothers and two sisters.

318
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:10,353
Your sisters married?

319
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:13,985
- They have children?
- One has two, the other has four.

320
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:18,635
- You'll have lots of children, too.
- We're fertile.

321
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:23,273
- I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
- My goodness!

322
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:30,378
Would you like me to wash
and you can wipe for a while?

323
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:32,879
No. That's fine, dear.

324
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:45,260
Roman, stop bending Guy's ears
with your Modjeska stories.

325
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,191
He's only listening
because he's being polite.

326
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:49,389
No, it's very interesting,
Mrs Castevet.

327
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,797
Minnie! I'm Minnie, he's Roman, OK?

328
00:28:54,872 --> 00:28:56,999
OK! Terrific. Just terrific.

329
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:01,338
Goodbye, darling. Goodbye.
It was lovely, bless you.

330
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:04,413
- Minnie!
- Minnie, ya great kid, ya.

331
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:08,082
How about that steak?!

332
00:29:08,252 --> 00:29:10,686
And the cake!
How did you eat two pieces?

333
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:14,085
Out of politeness.
That's how, out of politeness.

334
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:19,059
Only three dinner plates
that matched.

335
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,329
- And all that beautiful silver.
- Maybe they'll will it to us.

336
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:30,137
- Guess what's in their bathroom?
- A bidet.

337
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:34,937
"Jokes For The John." A book
on a hook next to the toilet.

338
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,949
Roman's stories are pretty
damned interesting, though.

339
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:42,383
I've never heard
of Forbes-Robertson before.

340
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:45,488
I'm going to go there tomorrow night
and hear some more.

341
00:29:45,656 --> 00:29:49,251
- You are?
- He asked me. Do this for me.

342
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,360
I thought we were seeing
Joan and Dick Jellico.

343
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:53,462
- Was that definite?
- Not definite.

344
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:55,825
We'll see them next week.

345
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:59,264
You don't have to come along
if you don't want to.

346
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:04,271
- You can stay here.
- Yeah, I think I will stay here.

347
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:09,336
He knew Henry Irving, too.
I mean, really interesting.

348
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:12,346
Why did they take
their pictures down?

349
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:13,574
What do you mean?

350
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:18,347
Their pictures. They took them down.
Hooks in the wall and clean spaces.

351
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:21,423
- The one picture there doesn't fit.
- I didn't notice.

352
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:04,793
Hi, dear. This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,

353
00:31:05,002 --> 00:31:08,165
lives up on 12.
This is Guy's wife, Rosemary.

354
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:10,306
Hello, Rosemary!

355
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:14,001
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
Could we come in?

356
00:31:14,178 --> 00:31:17,841
- Of course. Please do.
- There you are. Go ahead.

357
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,575
Look what they got. There's a light.

358
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:26,447
- Gosh! Isn't that beautiful!
- It came this morning.

359
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,784
Are you all right, dear?
You look worn.

360
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,223
I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.

361
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:37,823
And you're up and around? On my
first day, I couldn't do anything!

362
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:40,936
Dan gave me gin through
a straw to kill the pain.

363
00:31:41,105 --> 00:31:43,835
Girls today take things
more in their stride.

364
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:48,307
They're healthier than we were,
thanks to vitamins, medical care...

365
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:52,506
- What are those things, seat covers?
- Cushions for the window seats.

366
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:54,878
Oh, yeah.

367
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:04,384
Before I forget,
this is for you from Roman and me.

368
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:06,222
For me?

369
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,898
It's a little present for moving in.

370
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:12,558
- There's no reason...
- It's real old, over 300 years.

371
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:21,836
It's lovely.

372
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:25,846
The green inside is tannis root.
That's for good luck.

373
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:32,753
- It's lovely, but I can't accept it.
- You already have. Put it on.

374
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:38,254
You'll get used to the smell
before you know it.

375
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:40,293
Yeah, go on.

376
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:44,590
Oh, yes.

377
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,338
Were his stories
as interesting as last night?

378
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,636
- Yes. Did you have a good time?
- All right. I got a present.

379
00:32:55,979 --> 00:32:59,972
- It was Terry's.
- No kidding? Kind of pretty, though.

380
00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:05,746
Aren't you going to wear it?

381
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:11,054
It smells. There's stuff in it called
tannis root from her greenhouse.

382
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:13,059
Not too bad, though.

383
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:23,736
Tannis, anyone?

384
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:27,274
If you took it, you ought to wear it.

385
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:48,622
Hello? Yes, this is he.

386
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:57,637
Oh, God, no.

387
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:01,945
The poor guy.

388
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:06,683
And they don't have
any idea what's causing it?

389
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,183
Oh, my God, that's awful.
That's just awful.

390
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:15,558
Yes, I would. I mean, yes, I am.

391
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:20,594
I hate to get it that way, but...

392
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:26,302
You'd have to speak to my agent
about that end of it.

393
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,027
Alan Stone.

394
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,073
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
not as far as we're concerned.

395
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:36,642
Thank you, Mr Weiss.

396
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:44,212
Guy? What is it?

397
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:52,224
Donald Baumgart. He's gone blind.

398
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:55,126
He woke up yesterday
and he can't see.

399
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:58,529
- Oh, no.
- I've got the part.

400
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,705
It's a hell of a way to get it.

401
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:10,078
Listen...
I have to get out and walk around.

402
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:12,738
Yeah, I understand. Go ahead.

403
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:26,792
Baumgart. Donald Baumgart.

404
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:28,398
It's a fascinating part.
He'll be noticed.

405
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:31,265
It's a fascinating part.
He'll be noticed.

406
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:35,428
He also has an offer for a lead
in a TV series, Miami Beach.

407
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:38,107
He's suddenly very hot.

408
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:40,800
Now I understand
why you're so overjoyed.

409
00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:45,880
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life. A challenge.

410
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,110
I see.

411
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:51,550
You know how actors are,
they're all a bit self-centred.

412
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:55,590
I bet even Laurence Olivier
is vain and self-centred.

413
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:58,789
It's a difficult part.

414
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:04,093
He's got to work with crutches,
and naturally he's preoccupied.

415
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:08,499
And he... Well, preoccupied.

416
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,141
You had another suicide
up there at Happy House.

417
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,437
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.

418
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:20,640
It was the girl who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castevets.

419
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,045
I'm sure I told you that.

420
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:24,414
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully.

421
00:36:47,477 --> 00:36:49,502
I've been a creep.

422
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,274
It's from worrying
if Baumgart would regain his sight.

423
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,748
You're bound to feel
two ways about it.

424
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:59,821
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

425
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,355
- You haven't been.
- Yes, I have.

426
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:04,358
I've been tearing my
hair out over my career.

427
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:06,928
Let's have a baby. All right?

428
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,293
Let's have three babies,
one at a time.

429
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,799
A baby. You know,
Mama, Dada, poo-poo. You know?

430
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,666
- You mean it?
- Sure, I mean it.

431
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,468
I even figured out
the right time to start, look.

432
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:25,578
- You really mean it, really?
- No, I'm kidding. Sure, I mean it.

433
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:29,050
Ro, honey, for God's sake, don't cry.

434
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:31,278
Oh, no. I won't.

435
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,122
Here goes nothing.

436
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:53,935
- The paint! The paint!
- Good grief.

437
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,446
Nobody has a fire tonight.

438
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:16,690
Isn't it gorgeous? I hope
we have the coldest winter ever.

439
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:34,678
Shit!

440
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:43,291
Hi, Guy! How are ya?

441
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,486
No, don't let her in. Not tonight.

442
00:38:47,197 --> 00:38:49,324
<i>That's very kind of you. </i>

443
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:57,700
- <i>Are you sure you won't come in? </i>
- <i>No! I don't want to bother you. </i>

444
00:38:59,843 --> 00:39:02,368
Good. Good.

445
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:09,641
Who says there's nothing to ESP?
We shall have dessert after all!

446
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:13,721
Mousse au chocolat. Or, as Minnie
calls it, "chocolate mouse".

447
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:16,925
I was afraid she'd stay all evening.

448
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:21,723
She just wanted us to try it.
It's one of her specialities.

449
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:24,492
It was sweet of her, really.
We shouldn't make fun of her.

450
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,464
Yeah, you're right...

451
00:39:38,915 --> 00:39:40,974
It's good.

452
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,594
It has an undertaste.
A chalky undertaste.

453
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,367
I don't get it.

454
00:40:06,843 --> 00:40:09,209
That's silly, there's no undertaste.

455
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:10,812
There is.

456
00:40:11,848 --> 00:40:14,180
Come on. The old bat
slaved all day. Now eat it.

457
00:40:14,884 --> 00:40:16,852
- I don't like it.
- It's delicious.

458
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,888
- You have mine.
- There's always something wrong.

459
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:24,424
If it's going to turn
into a big thing...

460
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:26,824
If you can't stand it, don't eat it.

461
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,557
It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.

462
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:35,236
Would you
turn the record over, please?

463
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:51,020
There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?

464
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:54,486
You get two of them.
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.

465
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:56,319
You were.

466
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:00,489
It's the Pope at Yankee Stadium!

467
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:03,925
Christ, what a mob!

468
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:08,665
<i>Everywhere the Pope has been</i>
<i>he's received this type of reception. </i>

469
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:10,703
<i>As one man put it this afternoon, </i>

470
00:41:10,874 --> 00:41:16,244
<i>"Perhaps we are being undignified, </i>
<i>but this is a special day. "</i>

471
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:20,406
That's a great spot
for my Yamaha commercial.

472
00:41:21,618 --> 00:41:24,781
<i>Here's a brief summary</i>
<i>of today's historic happenings. </i>

473
00:41:24,954 --> 00:41:28,549
<i>Pope Paul VI arrived at 9.2 7 am... </i>

474
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:33,989
- What is it?
- Dizzy...

475
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:46,042
No wonder. All that booze.

476
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,438
You didn't eat anything
all day before dinner.

477
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:24,943
- Nice.
- Sleep is what you need.

478
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:29,245
- A good night's sleep.
- We have to make a baby.

479
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:34,879
We'll do it.
Tomorrow. There's plenty of time.

480
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:38,191
Just a nap.

481
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:20,759
- Why are you taking them off?
- To make you more comfortable.

482
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,599
- I am more comfortable.
- Sleep, Ro.

483
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:09,315
- Isn't Hutch coming with us?
- Catholics only.

484
00:44:09,485 --> 00:44:15,082
I wish we weren't bound by these
prejudices, but unfortunately...

485
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,780
Easy, easy. You've got her too high.

486
00:45:02,985 --> 00:45:08,548
Typhoon! Typhoon!
It killed 55 people in London!

487
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,559
You better go down below, miss.

488
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:25,028
- She's awake. She sees.
- She don't see.

489
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,466
As long as she ate the mouse,
she can't see nor hear. Now sing.

490
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:42,507
I'm sorry to hear
you aren't feeling well.

491
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,685
It's only the mouse bite.

492
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:49,517
You'd better have your legs tied down
in case of convulsions.

493
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:55,358
Yes, I suppose so.
There's always a chance it was rabid.

494
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,092
If the music bothers you
let me know and I'll stop it.

495
00:47:00,268 --> 00:47:04,830
Oh, no. Please don't
change the program on my account.

496
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:09,867
Try to sleep.
We'll be waiting up on deck.

497
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:50,946
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

498
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:02,429
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.

499
00:48:02,597 --> 00:48:05,828
Yes. That's why
I couldn't come to see you.

500
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:09,698
That's all right. We wouldn't
want you to jeopardise your health.

501
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,170
- Am I forgiven, Father?
- Oh, absolutely.

502
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:32,151
It's after nine.

503
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:40,866
- Five minutes.
- I have to be at Alan's at 10.

504
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:44,838
- Eat out.
- Like hell I will.

505
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:58,946
- What time is it?
- It's ten after nine.

506
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,316
What time did I go to sleep?

507
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,926
You didn't go to sleep.
You passed out.

508
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:11,031
From now on you get cocktails
or wine, not cocktails and wine.

509
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,997
The dreams I had.

510
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,537
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.

511
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:24,707
I didn't want to miss baby night.

512
00:49:24,913 --> 00:49:27,507
- A couple of nails were ragged.
- While I was out?

513
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:31,311
It was fun,
in a necrophile sort of way.

514
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:37,717
I dreamed someone was raping me.

515
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,419
- I don't know, someone inhuman.
- Thanks a lot!

516
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:46,866
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

517
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:50,501
I didn't want to miss the night.

518
00:49:50,672 --> 00:49:55,905
We could've done it this morning.
Last night wasn't the only time.

519
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:59,137
I was a little bit
loaded myself, you know?

520
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:21,662
- Hello! Did ya like it?
- Oh, yes.

521
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:24,066
I put too much cream de cocoa in it.

522
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:26,503
No, no.
You'll have to give me the recipe.

523
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:30,201
Yeah. You going shopping?
Do me a teeny favour, will ya?

524
00:50:30,412 --> 00:50:33,074
Get me six eggs,
a small instant Sanka.

525
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:35,340
Right. Bye-bye.

526
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:47,126
Don't you think
we ought to talk about it?

527
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:50,662
- What?
- The way you haven't looked at me.

528
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:54,063
- What? I've been looking at you.
- You haven't.

529
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:58,035
Sure I have.
What is it? What's the matter?

530
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:02,271
Nothing. Never mind.

531
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:05,844
- No, don't say that. What is it?
- Nothing.

532
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:10,345
Look, honey, I know I've been
preoccupied with the part,

533
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:13,885
but it is important.
That doesn't mean I don't love you.

534
00:51:28,636 --> 00:51:33,767
- It was due on Friday.
- It was?

535
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,237
It'll probably come
tonight or tomorrow.

536
00:51:37,445 --> 00:51:38,969
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.

537
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,411
- A quarter. You're gonna lose.
- Shut up, will you?

538
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:46,418
You're getting me jumpy.
It's only been two days.

539
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:48,021
When will I know?

540
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,453
I'll call you when I get the results.

541
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:54,823
I like to do a general examination
just to know something more.

542
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:59,826
- Elise Dunstan recommended you.
- How is she?

543
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:03,459
Fine. The boys are great.
Did you deliver them all?

544
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:06,766
No, just the last.
Universal haemoglobin.

545
00:52:06,941 --> 00:52:08,602
Yes, Doctor.

546
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:25,592
- We went to see The Fantasticks.
- Did you? Did you enjoy it?

547
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,819
- Yeah.
- Good.

548
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,029
- Hello?
- <i>Mrs Woodhouse? </i>

549
00:52:36,204 --> 00:52:38,672
- Dr Hill?
- <i>Congratulations. </i>

550
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,001
- Really?
- <i>Really. </i>

551
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:47,377
- <i>Are you there? </i>
- Yes, what happens now?

552
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:51,610
<i>You come see me next month. </i>
<i>Get those pills. One a day. </i>

553
00:52:51,786 --> 00:52:55,517
- <i>I'll mail you hospital forms. </i>
- When will it be?

554
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:00,127
- <i>It works out to be June 28th. </i>
- That sounds so far away.

555
00:53:00,295 --> 00:53:04,459
<i>It is. One more thing, </i>
<i>we'd like another blood sample. </i>

556
00:53:04,632 --> 00:53:07,931
Yes, of course. What for?

557
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:11,435
<i>The nurse didn't take enough, </i>
<i>so would you drop by and see her? </i>

558
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,335
But I am pregnant, aren't I?

559
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:17,535
<i>Oh, yes, it's just</i>
<i>for blood samp... er, blood sugar. </i>

560
00:53:17,745 --> 00:53:21,704
- <i>You're pregnant, don't worry. </i>
- I'll come in on Monday.

561
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:26,376
- <i>Don't forget the pills. </i>
- No, I won't. Goodbye, Dr Hill.

562
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,181
Blood sugar?

563
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,471
What's that?

564
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:54,613
That's great! That's just great.

565
00:53:54,782 --> 00:53:57,182
- Father.
- Mother.

566
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:04,187
Guy, listen.
Let's make this a new beginning, OK?

567
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:08,386
A new openness with each other,
because we haven't been open.

568
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:14,001
That's true. I've been
so self-centred. That's the trouble.

569
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:18,161
You know I love you, don't you, Ro?
I swear to God, I'll be as open...

570
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,864
- It's my fault too.
- Bull, it's mine.

571
00:54:21,075 --> 00:54:23,703
Bear with me.
I'll do better, you hear?

572
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:25,344
Oh, Guy.

573
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:36,354
What?

574
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:40,719
It's a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.

575
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:45,130
- Know what I'd love to do?
- What?

576
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,200
Tell Minnie and Roman.

577
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:52,601
I know it's supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,

578
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:57,768
but I already told them
we were trying. They were so pleased.

579
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:02,774
- Tell them.
- Back in two minutes?

580
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:18,761
You're pregnant.
Another blood sample.

581
00:55:21,302 --> 00:55:24,635
Now, that's what I call good news.

582
00:55:24,806 --> 00:55:29,038
- Honey, congratulations.
- Thank you.

583
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:33,179
Best wishes, Rosemary.
We're more pleased than we can say.

584
00:55:33,348 --> 00:55:36,647
We didn't have any champagne
but this will do.

585
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:39,719
- When are you due?
- June 28th.

586
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:42,549
It'll be so exciting.
You got a good doctor?

587
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:44,089
Yes, very good.

588
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,955
One of the top obstetricians
is a friend of ours, Abe Sapirstein.

589
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:49,721
Delivers all the society babies.

590
00:55:49,897 --> 00:55:53,162
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.

591
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:56,895
- Wasn't he on Open End?
- That's right.

592
00:55:57,071 --> 00:56:00,632
- Ro?
- Well, what about Dr Hill?

593
00:56:00,842 --> 00:56:04,403
Don't worry, I'll tell him something.
You know me.

594
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:07,137
I won't let you go to
no Dr Hill nobody ever heard of.

595
00:56:07,348 --> 00:56:10,943
The best is what you'll have!
Where's your telephone?

596
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,180
- In the bedroom.
- He's a brilliant man, very sensitive.

597
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:18,450
- Ro, sit down, sit down.
- No, I'm fine.

598
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:24,531
Abe? Minnie. A dear friend of ours
just found out she's pregnant.

599
00:56:24,699 --> 00:56:29,568
I'm in her apartment right now.
We said you'd take care of her,

600
00:56:29,737 --> 00:56:33,173
you wouldn't charge
your society prices neither.

601
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:37,107
Just a minute.
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11?

602
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,712
- All right.
- Yeah, 11 is fine, Abe.

603
00:56:40,882 --> 00:56:44,784
Yeah, well, you, too.
No, no, not at all.

604
00:56:44,952 --> 00:56:47,921
All right.
Well, let's hope so. Goodbye.

605
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:51,388
- Well, there you are.
- Thanks a million, Minnie.

606
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,553
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Just have a fine, healthy baby.

607
00:56:56,731 --> 00:56:59,598
My, I can't wait
to tell Laura-Louise.

608
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:04,033
Please don't tell anyone else,
not right away.

609
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:06,833
She's right. There's plenty of time.

610
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:10,944
- Now, to a fine, healthy baby.
- Hear, hear!

611
00:57:13,614 --> 00:57:18,381
Andy. Or Susan.

612
00:57:20,488 --> 00:57:22,080
Susan.

613
00:58:07,668 --> 00:58:09,727
Please don't read books.

614
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:14,341
No pregnancy was ever
exactly like the ones in books.

615
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:17,204
And don't listen
to your friends, either.

616
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,505
No two pregnancies are ever alike.

617
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:23,479
- Dr Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
- No pills.

618
00:58:24,118 --> 00:58:28,748
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.
I'll have her make a daily drink

619
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:33,587
that'll be fresher, safer
and more vitamin-rich than any pills.

620
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:37,590
Any questions,
call me, night or day.

621
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:40,290
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.

622
00:58:40,468 --> 00:58:43,062
- Here.
- What's in it?

623
00:58:43,237 --> 00:58:46,104
Snips and snails
and puppy dogs' tails.

624
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:50,108
- But what if we want a girl?
- Do you?

625
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:52,472
It would be nice
if the first one were a boy.

626
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,545
There you are.

627
00:58:57,318 --> 00:58:58,717
No, really, what is in it?

628
00:58:58,886 --> 00:59:03,016
- A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.
- Tannis root?

629
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:05,954
Some of that
along with some other things.

630
00:59:08,029 --> 00:59:11,430
If you want to be stupid
be non-violent stupid.

631
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,399
I'm in love with no one,
especially not your fat wife.

632
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:17,765
I'm a hopeless cripple...

633
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:22,102
What's that?

634
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:27,145
- I've been to Vidal Sassoon.
- Don't tell me you paid for that?

635
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:32,451
- Guy, I have a pain.
- Where?

636
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,111
- Here.
- Just now?

637
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:39,817
- Since Monday. A sharp pain.
- Did you see Sapirstein?

638
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:44,090
- I'm seeing him Wednesday.
- This is ridiculous. Go see him.

639
00:59:44,265 --> 00:59:47,598
- Why didn't you say?
- I see him Wednesday regular.

640
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:52,102
A natural expansion of the pelvis.
Take some ordinary aspirin.

641
00:59:52,273 --> 00:59:55,106
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.

642
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:58,506
I thought you weren't
going to read books?

643
00:59:58,713 --> 01:00:01,773
- It was in the drugstore.
- It just worried you.

644
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:06,283
Throw it away, please?
The pains will be gone in two days.

645
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,148
Ectopic pregnancy!

646
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:54,732
I look awful.

647
01:00:56,003 --> 01:00:58,995
What are you talking about?
You look great.

648
01:00:59,173 --> 01:01:02,006
It's that haircut that looks awful.

649
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:05,872
You want the truth, honey, that's
the worst mistake you ever made.

650
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:44,850
- My God!
- It's Vidal Sassoon. It's very in.

651
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:48,284
- What's wrong with you?
- Do I look that bad?

652
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:51,721
Terrible! You're not on
one of those Zen diets?

653
01:01:51,892 --> 01:01:53,826
- No.
- Then what is it?

654
01:01:53,994 --> 01:01:56,019
Have you seen a doctor?

655
01:01:56,197 --> 01:01:58,631
I might as well tell you.
I'm pregnant.

656
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:03,236
Rubbish. Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.

657
01:02:03,404 --> 01:02:07,932
I don't sleep well. I have stiff
joints or something, so I get a pain.

658
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:12,101
- Nothing serious.
- Well, congratulations.

659
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:15,874
- You must be very happy.
- I am. We both are.

660
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:19,484
- Who's your obstetrician?
- Abraham Sapirstein.

661
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,554
He delivered
two of my daughter's babies.

662
01:02:22,723 --> 01:02:26,420
- He's one of the best.
- When did you see him last?

663
01:02:26,594 --> 01:02:28,562
- Yesterday.
- And?

664
01:02:28,729 --> 01:02:31,095
And he says it's fairly common.

665
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:36,832
- How much weight have you lost?
- Three pounds.

666
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:39,871
You've lost far more than that.

667
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,235
It's perfectly normal
to lose a little at first.

668
01:02:42,443 --> 01:02:44,638
Later on, I'll be gaining.

669
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,313
We must assume Dr Sapirstein
knows whereof he speaks.

670
01:02:49,483 --> 01:02:51,815
He should. He charges enough.

671
01:02:51,986 --> 01:02:55,717
We get bargain rates.
Our neighbours are his friends.

672
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,948
I'll go.

673
01:02:57,124 --> 01:03:00,651
Stay where you are.
It hurts less when I move around.

674
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:06,097
- I was just talking about you.
- Favourably, I hope.

675
01:03:06,267 --> 01:03:09,327
- Do you need anything?
- No. Thank you for asking.

676
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:13,940
- Is Guy home already?
- He won't be home till six.

677
01:03:14,108 --> 01:03:18,340
A friend of ours is here.
Would you like to meet him?

678
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:22,573
- If I won't be intruding?
- No. Please come in.

679
01:03:33,694 --> 01:03:37,562
Hutch, this is Roman Castevet.
Edward Hutchins.

680
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,460
- How do you do?
- How are you, sir?

681
01:03:39,633 --> 01:03:42,693
I was just telling Hutch
you sent me to Dr Sapirstein.

682
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:45,964
- Rosemary told you the news?
- Yes.

683
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:50,099
- She must get plenty of rest.
- I was alarmed by her appearance.

684
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:53,872
She has lost some weight,
but that's quite normal.

685
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:56,845
Later she'll gain, probably too much.

686
01:03:57,017 --> 01:03:59,611
- So I gather.
- Please sit down.

687
01:03:59,787 --> 01:04:03,348
Mrs Castevet makes a vitamin drink
for me from herbs she grows.

688
01:04:03,524 --> 01:04:06,891
All according
to Dr Sapirstein's directions.

689
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:11,157
He's suspicious of commercially
prepared vitamin pills.

690
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:15,291
But they're manufactured
under every imaginable safeguard.

691
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:19,701
True, but pills can sit
for months on a druggist's shelf,

692
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:22,172
and lose their original potency.

693
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:26,745
- I hadn't thought of that.
- I like having everything natural.

694
01:04:26,914 --> 01:04:32,147
I'll bet expectant mothers chewed
tannis root before vitamin pills.

695
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,652
- Tannis root?
- It's one of the herbs in the drink.

696
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,654
Is it an herb? Can a root be an herb?

697
01:04:37,825 --> 01:04:41,921
- You don't mean anise or orrisroot?
- No, tannis.

698
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,396
Look.

699
01:04:47,368 --> 01:04:49,233
It's good luck, too.

700
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:56,198
Doesn't look like root matter,

701
01:04:56,377 --> 01:04:59,574
more like mould
or fungus of some kind.

702
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:04,773
- Is it ever called any other name?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

703
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:09,185
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopaedia.

704
01:05:09,356 --> 01:05:13,725
- What a pretty holder or charm.
- The Castevets gave it to me.

705
01:05:13,894 --> 01:05:17,193
You seem to be taking better care
of Rosemary than her own parents.

706
01:05:17,364 --> 01:05:22,233
We're very fond of her. And Guy.
Now excuse me, I'll have to go.

707
01:05:22,403 --> 01:05:25,167
- My wife is waiting.
- It's nice to have met you.

708
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:27,074
Don't bother, Rosemary.
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

709
01:05:27,074 --> 01:05:29,872
Don't bother, Rosemary.
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

710
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:35,042
I just noticed he has pierced ears.

711
01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:39,151
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
What's she like?

712
01:05:40,821 --> 01:05:44,723
Nosy. Funny.
Guy's gotten very close to them.

713
01:05:44,892 --> 01:05:48,623
I suppose they've become
sort of parent figures for him.

714
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:54,294
- And you?
- I don't know.

715
01:05:54,468 --> 01:05:57,699
Sometimes
they're too friendly and helpful.

716
01:05:59,073 --> 01:06:01,132
Hey, what a surprise.
How are you, Hutch? Good to see you.

717
01:06:01,342 --> 01:06:05,403
- You're the surprise. What happened?
- They had a rewrite.

718
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,007
- Stay where you are. Nobody move.
- Would you like some coffee?

719
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:11,878
Love some!

720
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:20,492
- Loot!
- Congratulations are in order.

721
01:06:20,662 --> 01:06:22,926
- Wonderful, isn't it?
- When's the baby due?

722
01:06:23,098 --> 01:06:28,365
June 28th. Dr Sapirstein delivered
two of Hutch's grandchildren.

723
01:06:28,536 --> 01:06:29,730
Really?

724
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:32,600
I met your neighbour, Roman Castevet.

725
01:06:32,774 --> 01:06:37,108
- Did you? Funny old duck, isn't he?
- He has pierced ears.

726
01:06:37,312 --> 01:06:39,439
- You're kidding?
- No, I saw.

727
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:41,706
We haven't seen you lately,

728
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:46,046
but I'm so busy and Ro's pregnant,
so we haven't seen anyone.

729
01:06:46,221 --> 01:06:49,156
- Let's have dinner soon.
- You're not going?

730
01:06:49,324 --> 01:06:52,452
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Thanks for coming.

731
01:06:57,165 --> 01:06:58,894
This isn't mine. It must be yours.

732
01:06:59,067 --> 01:07:02,867
Right. Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?

733
01:07:03,038 --> 01:07:06,496
Andrew or Douglas for a boy,
Melinda or Sarah for a girl.

734
01:07:06,674 --> 01:07:10,440
- What happened to Susan?
- Is there another of these?

735
01:07:16,484 --> 01:07:19,885
- I don't see it, Hutch.
- No, it's not here.

736
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:23,183
I probably left it at the
City Centre. I'll stop back there.

737
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:26,759
- Let's have that dinner, shall we?
- Next week.

738
01:07:26,928 --> 01:07:29,419
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

739
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:41,539
- That was a nice surprise.
- Guess what he said.

740
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,679
- What?
- I look terrible.

741
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:49,248
Good old Hutch.
Spreading cheer wherever he goes.

742
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:52,181
I'm going to get a paper, honey.

743
01:07:52,353 --> 01:07:55,413
- He's a professional crepehanger.
- He's not.

744
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:58,423
Then he's a top-ranking amateur.

745
01:08:10,071 --> 01:08:13,768
Hello. She's not feeling too well.

746
01:08:14,843 --> 01:08:16,970
I think she's asleep.

747
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,507
She could be, yeah.

748
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:25,246
All right, can you hold on a minute?

749
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:30,553
It's Hutch. He wants to speak to you.

750
01:08:31,493 --> 01:08:34,826
I told him you were resting
but he said it couldn't wait.

751
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:45,662
- Hutch?
- <i>Dear, do you go out at all? </i>

752
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,139
Well, I haven't been going out, why?

753
01:08:49,344 --> 01:08:53,303
<i>Can you meet me tomorrow morning</i>
<i>in front of the Time</i>-<i>Life Building? </i>

754
01:08:53,515 --> 01:08:57,076
If you want me to.
What is it? Can't you tell me now?

755
01:08:57,252 --> 01:09:00,619
<i>I'd rather not. </i>
<i>We can have an early lunch. </i>

756
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:02,983
- That would be nice.
- <i>Good. 11 o'clock? </i>

757
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:05,626
OK. Did you find your glove?

758
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:08,626
<i>They didn't have it. </i>
<i>Good night, Rosemary. Sleep well. </i>

759
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:10,388
You, too. Good night.

760
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:13,828
- What was that?
- He wants to talk to me.

761
01:09:14,002 --> 01:09:17,403
- What about?
- I don't know. He wouldn't say.

762
01:09:17,572 --> 01:09:21,064
Those boys' adventure stories
are going to his head.

763
01:09:23,578 --> 01:09:25,944
Where are you meeting him?

764
01:09:26,114 --> 01:09:29,083
Time and Life Building
tomorrow at 11 o'clock.

765
01:09:31,853 --> 01:09:34,845
You're pregnant, I've got the yens.

766
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:37,890
- I'm getting an ice-cream. Want one?
- I'd love one.

767
01:09:38,059 --> 01:09:40,527
- Vanilla?
- OK.

768
01:10:04,485 --> 01:10:07,318
Minnie, I'm going out now,
so I won't have my drink at 11.

769
01:10:07,488 --> 01:10:11,288
Fine, dear. Take it later.
Buzz me when you get back.

770
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,746
Pain, begone.
I will have no more of thee.

771
01:11:17,725 --> 01:11:20,455
- <i>Yes? </i>
- Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?

772
01:11:20,628 --> 01:11:23,461
- <i>Yes. Who is this? </i>
- My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

773
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:26,930
I had an appointment
with Mr Hutchins. Is he there?

774
01:11:28,102 --> 01:11:30,969
- Hello?
- <i>He was taken ill this morning. </i>

775
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:34,298
- Taken ill?
- <i>Yes. </i>

776
01:11:34,475 --> 01:11:37,774
<i>He's in a deep coma</i>
<i>at St Vincent's Hospital. </i>

777
01:11:37,979 --> 01:11:43,076
That's awful. I just spoke
to him last night about 10.30.

778
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:46,414
- <i>I spoke to him at 11.</i>
- Who is this?

779
01:11:46,587 --> 01:11:50,990
<i>You don't know me. </i>
<i>I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend. </i>

780
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:54,560
- Do they know what's causing it?
- <i>No, they don't know yet. </i>

781
01:11:54,729 --> 01:11:59,962
<i>He's totally unresponsive. </i>
<i>I'm going to the hospital now. </i>

782
01:12:00,134 --> 01:12:03,194
- Is there anything I can do?
- <i>Not really. </i>

783
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:06,763
All right, thank you.

784
01:12:34,669 --> 01:12:38,969
No! This is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!

785
01:12:41,142 --> 01:12:44,077
I said to myself,
if Rosemary's going out,

786
01:12:44,245 --> 01:12:46,975
I might as well
do some Christmas shopping.

787
01:12:47,181 --> 01:12:50,912
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?

788
01:12:51,085 --> 01:12:54,953
Darling, what's the matter?
You feel all right?

789
01:12:56,491 --> 01:12:58,959
You poor thing.

790
01:12:59,127 --> 01:13:03,086
You know what? I think we better
be going home now. What do you say?

791
01:13:03,264 --> 01:13:08,201
- No, you have your shopping to do.
- There's two more weeks.

792
01:13:25,253 --> 01:13:26,948
It'll stop any day now.

793
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:30,113
It's like a wire
inside me tightening.

794
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:35,194
Usually older women with less
flexible joints have this trouble.

795
01:13:35,363 --> 01:13:37,763
- I'm not going out.
- You don't have to.

796
01:13:37,932 --> 01:13:40,526
One minute to go!

797
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:46,006
Rosemary, meet Dr Shand.
He used to be a famous dentist.

798
01:13:46,174 --> 01:13:49,940
- He made the chain for your charm.
- How do you do?

799
01:13:50,144 --> 01:13:52,806
Come on, sweetie.
Put this wonderful hat on.

800
01:13:53,014 --> 01:13:55,005
Doctor, come over here.

801
01:13:55,216 --> 01:13:58,185
- Minnie, Minnie!
- Happy New Year.

802
01:13:58,386 --> 01:14:01,378
- Have a good year.
- Happy New Year.

803
01:14:03,724 --> 01:14:07,956
To 1966! The year one!

804
01:15:00,882 --> 01:15:02,941
What the hell are you doing?

805
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:07,917
Planning the menu. We're having
a party a week from Saturday.

806
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:12,253
It's for our old...
I mean, our young friends.

807
01:15:12,426 --> 01:15:16,055
Minnie and Roman are not invited.
Neither is Laura-Louise.

808
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:17,857
Nor is Dr Sapirstein.

809
01:15:18,032 --> 01:15:21,991
It's a very special party.
You have to be under 60 to get in.

810
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:32,244
Well... for a minute there, I didn't
think I was going to make it.

811
01:15:32,413 --> 01:15:35,780
You'll make it.
You can be bartender.

812
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:40,284
Swell. Do you really think
it's such a good idea?

813
01:15:40,454 --> 01:15:42,979
It's the best idea
I've had in months.

814
01:15:43,157 --> 01:15:46,320
Shouldn't you check
with Dr Sapirstein?

815
01:15:46,494 --> 01:15:49,691
I'm giving a party,
not swimming the English Channel.

816
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:51,798
What about the pain?

817
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,636
Haven't you heard?
lt'll go away in a day or two.

818
01:15:56,804 --> 01:16:01,503
- That looks interesting.
- We're having some people over.

819
01:16:01,676 --> 01:16:03,371
You feel up to entertaining?

820
01:16:03,578 --> 01:16:07,207
Yes. These are old friends
that I haven't seen in a long time.

821
01:16:07,415 --> 01:16:11,681
- They don't even know I'm pregnant.
- I'll give you a hand if you like.

822
01:16:11,852 --> 01:16:14,514
No, thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.

823
01:16:14,689 --> 01:16:17,590
It's a buffet,
and we'll get a bartender, so...

824
01:16:17,758 --> 01:16:19,589
I'll help take the coats.

825
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,355
No, really, you do too much
for me as it is.

826
01:16:24,365 --> 01:16:26,356
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

827
01:16:26,534 --> 01:16:29,094
Drink your drink, hon.

828
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:32,762
I'd rather not.
Not right this minute.

829
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,840
I'll drink it in a little while.

830
01:16:35,042 --> 01:16:38,102
- It don't do to let it stand.
- No, I won't.

831
01:16:38,312 --> 01:16:40,837
You go back,
I'll bring the glass back later.

832
01:16:41,048 --> 01:16:42,675
I'll wait. Save you the walk.

833
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:47,253
It makes me very nervous when
people watch me cook. Now, scoot.

834
01:16:47,421 --> 01:16:51,255
Don't let it stand too long,
it'll lose its vitamins.

835
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:05,699
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!

836
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:08,171
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

837
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:11,000
- Hey, Rosie.
- Yeah?

838
01:17:11,212 --> 01:17:14,511
Bob and Leo got stuck at
another party but they'll be over.

839
01:17:14,682 --> 01:17:19,745
- Fine.
- Rosie, it's a fantastic house!

840
01:17:21,822 --> 01:17:26,725
- Hi. It's been so long.
- You look like a piece of chalk.

841
01:17:28,362 --> 01:17:30,728
You make him feed you, love.

842
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,397
- Adrian Marcato lived here.
- And the Trench sisters.

843
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,197
They ate little children.

844
01:17:38,372 --> 01:17:43,071
He doesn't just mean they ate them.
He means they ate them.

845
01:17:48,582 --> 01:17:51,983
I make their first one strong
to get them happy.

846
01:17:52,153 --> 01:17:55,418
Rosie, do you feel OK?
You look tired.

847
01:17:57,024 --> 01:17:59,390
Thanks for the understatement.

848
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:04,863
How do you like CC Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?

849
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:08,934
- But I'm not going to him.
- You're not?

850
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:12,095
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein.

851
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:16,004
- Congratulations, Papa.
- Thanks. Nothing to it.

852
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:20,306
- I'll take that dip inside.
- Yeah, please. See my flowers?

853
01:18:20,514 --> 01:18:23,347
Yeah. Elise, will you give me a hand?

854
01:18:23,517 --> 01:18:25,212
Yeah, sure.

855
01:18:30,758 --> 01:18:33,318
Is the other guy still blind?

856
01:18:33,494 --> 01:18:37,794
Donald Baumgart? You know who he is.
The boy Zoe Piper lives with.

857
01:18:37,965 --> 01:18:39,933
- He's writing a play.
- Is he still blind?

858
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:44,333
Yeah. He's going through hell
trying to adjust.

859
01:18:44,505 --> 01:18:48,999
He dictates and Zoe writes.
Imagine the courage of this guy.

860
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:52,043
He's just been blind a few months.

861
01:18:54,548 --> 01:18:56,607
Are you all right?

862
01:18:58,285 --> 01:19:01,448
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a cramp for a minute.

863
01:19:01,622 --> 01:19:04,250
- Don't cry.
- It's good for her.

864
01:19:04,425 --> 01:19:08,725
Let her cry it out.
It's all right, darling. Sit down.

865
01:19:14,101 --> 01:19:15,864
- Out, out!
- Let me in.

866
01:19:16,036 --> 01:19:17,469
- Girls only.
- I want to see Rosemary.

867
01:19:17,638 --> 01:19:19,731
- She's busy.
- I have to wash these...

868
01:19:19,907 --> 01:19:21,807
Use the bathroom.

869
01:19:26,113 --> 01:19:29,674
It hurts so much.
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.

870
01:19:29,884 --> 01:19:32,375
When did the pain start?

871
01:19:33,954 --> 01:19:36,047
In November.

872
01:19:36,223 --> 01:19:38,589
- November?!
- What?

873
01:19:38,759 --> 01:19:42,752
You have been in pain since November,
and he's not helping?

874
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:45,296
He says it's gonna stop.

875
01:19:45,466 --> 01:19:49,527
- Why don't you see another doctor?
- No, he's very good.

876
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:54,037
- He was on Open End.
- He sounds like a sadistic nut.

877
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:59,669
Rosemary, pain like that is a
warning that something isn't right.

878
01:19:59,847 --> 01:20:03,647
Go see Dr Hill.
Go see anybody besides that... that...

879
01:20:03,818 --> 01:20:07,117
- That nut.
- Don't go on suffering like this.

880
01:20:07,288 --> 01:20:08,880
I won't have an abortion.

881
01:20:09,056 --> 01:20:12,321
Nobody's telling you to.
Just see another doctor.

882
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:25,569
The thing to do now is move.

883
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,673
- Guy?
- Yeah?

884
01:20:27,842 --> 01:20:30,834
I'm going to Dr Hill Monday morning.

885
01:20:32,146 --> 01:20:35,343
Dr Sapirstein is either lying,
or he's...

886
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:37,416
I don't know, out of his mind.

887
01:20:37,585 --> 01:20:40,076
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.

888
01:20:40,254 --> 01:20:43,951
- Rosemary...
- I'm not drinking Minnie's drink.

889
01:20:44,124 --> 01:20:47,423
I want vitamins in pills
like everyone else.

890
01:20:48,462 --> 01:20:51,363
I haven't drunk it for three days.
I've thrown it away.

891
01:20:51,532 --> 01:20:54,933
- You've what?
- I've made my own drink.

892
01:20:56,036 --> 01:20:59,369
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

893
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:02,407
- And is that their hint for today?
- They're my friends...

894
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:07,047
They're not very bright bitches
who should mind their own business!

895
01:21:07,248 --> 01:21:09,716
They said get a second opinion.

896
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:14,354
Rosemary, you know who Dr Hill is?
He's a Charlie nobody.

897
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:15,579
That's who he is!

898
01:21:15,756 --> 01:21:20,193
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr Sapirstein is.

899
01:21:20,361 --> 01:21:23,922
We'll have to pay Sapirstein,
pay Hill. It's out of the question.

900
01:21:24,064 --> 01:21:28,660
No, I'm not changing.
I just wanna get a second opinion.

901
01:21:28,836 --> 01:21:30,394
I won't let you do it, Ro.

902
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:34,507
I mean, because it's, uh...
it's not fair to Sapirstein.

903
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:38,033
Not fair to...?

904
01:21:38,245 --> 01:21:41,703
What are you talking about?
What about what's fair to me?

905
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:43,747
You want a second opinion?

906
01:21:43,918 --> 01:21:47,319
You tell Sapirstein
and let him decide who gives it.

907
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:50,252
No! I want Dr Hill!

908
01:21:50,424 --> 01:21:54,019
- At least have that much courtesy...
- If you won't pay, I'll...

909
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:05,003
- Rosemary? What is it?
- It stopped.

910
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,303
- What?
- The pain stopped just like that.

911
01:22:10,511 --> 01:22:12,570
- Stopped?
- Stopped.

912
01:22:14,815 --> 01:22:17,215
What was in that drink you made?

913
01:22:20,888 --> 01:22:26,053
- Eggs, milk, sugar.
- What else?

914
01:22:29,897 --> 01:22:31,831
What else?

915
01:22:31,999 --> 01:22:35,162
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake,
what else was in that drink?

916
01:22:37,037 --> 01:22:43,567
It's alive! Guy, it's moving!
It's alive! It's all right!

917
01:22:43,777 --> 01:22:47,110
- Feel. Feel.
- Yeah, I felt it.

918
01:22:47,281 --> 01:22:51,411
- Don't be scared. It won't bite you.
- It's wonderful. It really is.

919
01:22:51,585 --> 01:22:56,955
I feel it kicking.
It's alive! It's moving!

920
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:04,392
I'll clean up some of this mess.

921
01:23:20,781 --> 01:23:22,749
Watch the walls.

922
01:23:31,558 --> 01:23:35,016
- Thanks, have one on the baby.
- Thank you very much.

923
01:24:04,358 --> 01:24:05,484
What's that for?

924
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:09,254
- It's my hospital suitcase.
- You got three weeks.

925
01:24:16,603 --> 01:24:19,902
Yes? Hello, Mrs Cardiff.

926
01:24:21,742 --> 01:24:25,576
No. Oh, my God.

927
01:24:28,015 --> 01:24:31,951
Oh, my God. Yes, of course I will.

928
01:24:44,098 --> 01:24:46,498
Hutch is dead.

929
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:54,804
I feel awful. All this time,
I didn't even think of him.

930
01:25:15,262 --> 01:25:18,891
Doctor. Doris, we'll see you later.

931
01:25:19,066 --> 01:25:22,627
I beg your pardon. I'm Mrs Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

932
01:25:22,803 --> 01:25:25,499
- You're Rosemary?
- I'm so sorry.

933
01:25:25,672 --> 01:25:28,539
- Thank you. This is my sister.
- How do you do?

934
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:30,404
- And my husband.
- How do you do?

935
01:25:30,611 --> 01:25:31,771
I'm sorry to be late.

936
01:25:31,979 --> 01:25:37,781
- Excuse me. I'm Grace Cardiff.
- I was hoping to meet you.

937
01:25:37,951 --> 01:25:40,283
I was going to mail this,
but I thought you'd be here.

938
01:25:40,454 --> 01:25:42,979
- What is it?
- A book.

939
01:25:43,157 --> 01:25:47,321
Hutch regained consciousness
and thought it was the next morning.

940
01:25:47,494 --> 01:25:50,622
- You had the appointment?
- Oh, yes.

941
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:54,961
I wasn't there, but he told the
doctor to make sure you got the book.

942
01:25:55,135 --> 01:25:56,193
Thank you.

943
01:25:57,471 --> 01:26:00,167
And I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.

944
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:03,104
- The name of the book?
- Apparently.

945
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:06,143
He was delirious,
so it's hard to be sure.

946
01:26:31,738 --> 01:26:33,933
I heard you come in.
It wasn't very long.

947
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:38,942
- I was late. I couldn't get a taxi.
- What a shame. You got mail already?

948
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,613
- Somebody gave it to me.
- Here, I'll hold it. Book?

949
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,584
I know that house!
The Gilmores used to live there.

950
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:55,921
I've been there lots of times.
Grace... one of my favourite names.

951
01:26:56,096 --> 01:26:58,064
- Yes.
- You need anything?

952
01:26:58,232 --> 01:27:00,427
- Nothing, thank you.
- Take a nap.

953
01:27:00,601 --> 01:27:03,126
- I'm going to.
- Goodbye.

954
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:49,043
"Born in Glasgow in 1846, he was
soon after brought to New York.

955
01:27:49,216 --> 01:27:52,310
"He resided for several years
in the United St...

956
01:27:52,486 --> 01:27:55,922
"He was attacked by a mob
outside the Bram..."

957
01:27:56,957 --> 01:27:59,824
Outside, not in the lobby.

958
01:28:09,303 --> 01:28:12,295
There are no witches. Not really.

959
01:28:15,175 --> 01:28:17,735
The name is an anagram.

960
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:42,802
Now


961
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,592
What's with the chain?

962
01:30:52,497 --> 01:30:54,294
What's the matter?

963
01:30:55,734 --> 01:30:57,725
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

964
01:30:59,504 --> 01:31:01,062
Thank you.

965
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:04,037
- How was the funeral?
- OK.

966
01:31:04,242 --> 01:31:07,211
I got the shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

967
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:14,148
I got that shirt that
was in the New Yorker.

968
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:17,652
That's nice.
Do you know who Roman really is?

969
01:31:17,822 --> 01:31:20,620
- What do you mean?
- Adrian Marcato's son.

970
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:23,056
- What?
- Come here.

971
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,856
I want to show you something.

972
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:29,932
Roman Castevet
is Steven Marcato rearranged.

973
01:31:31,669 --> 01:31:33,569
It's from Hutch.

974
01:31:39,377 --> 01:31:40,810
Look.

975
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:46,747
And look here. There he is
when he was 13. See the eyes?

976
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:53,456
- Coincidence.
- In the same house? And look here.

977
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:58,062
"Soon after that in August, 1886,
his son Steven was born."

978
01:31:58,229 --> 01:32:03,189
1886, got it? That makes him 79 now.
No coincidence.

979
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:14,136
No, I guess not. He's Steven Marcato,
all right. Poor old geezer.

980
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:18,281
With a crazy father like that, no
wonder he switched his name around.

981
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:22,784
- You don't think he's the same?
- What do you mean, a witch?

982
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:26,788
Ro, are you kidding? Ro, honey.

983
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,950
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?

984
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:32,255
Honey, it's 1966.

985
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:36,196
This was published in 1933.
There were covens in Europe.

986
01:32:36,367 --> 01:32:39,359
That's their name, the congregation.

987
01:32:39,537 --> 01:32:43,405
Covens in Europe, America,
Australia and one right here.

988
01:32:43,608 --> 01:32:47,044
The parties with the singing
and the flute and the chanting,

989
01:32:47,245 --> 01:32:50,146
- Those are Sabbaths.
- Don't get excited.

990
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:53,773
Read what they do.
They use blood in their rituals.

991
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,579
And the most powerful
is baby's blood.

992
01:32:56,754 --> 01:33:00,656
- They use the flesh, too.
- For God's sakes!

993
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:05,091
They're not entering this apartment
again or coming near the baby.

994
01:33:05,263 --> 01:33:07,993
They're old people with old friends!

995
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:10,566
Dr Shand happens
to play the recorder!

996
01:33:10,735 --> 01:33:14,694
I'm not taking any chances.
We'll sublet, move out.

997
01:33:14,873 --> 01:33:18,172
We are not.
We'll talk about it later.

998
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,644
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

999
01:33:24,816 --> 01:33:27,512
- Just this last chapter.
- Not today.

1000
01:33:28,553 --> 01:33:32,614
Look. Your hands are shaking.
Come on. Give it to me.

1001
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:35,691
I mean it, now. Give it to me.

1002
01:33:44,335 --> 01:33:46,030
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

1003
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:48,798
- What was the name? Marchado?
- Marcato.

1004
01:33:48,973 --> 01:33:53,000
- He said his father was an importer.
- He told Guy he was a producer.

1005
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:56,078
I understand how disturbed you must
be with him for a neighbour.

1006
01:33:56,247 --> 01:33:58,909
I don't want anything more
to do with him, or Minnie.

1007
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:04,783
- I can't take the slightest chance.
- Any mother would feel the same.

1008
01:34:04,956 --> 01:34:09,325
Is there any chance that Minnie put
something harmful in those drinks,

1009
01:34:09,494 --> 01:34:10,518
or in those little cakes?

1010
01:34:10,695 --> 01:34:14,597
No, I'd have seen evidence long ago.

1011
01:34:14,766 --> 01:34:17,530
I won't take anything else from them.

1012
01:34:17,702 --> 01:34:22,071
I can give you some pills that'll be
adequate these last few weeks.

1013
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:27,109
In a way, this may be the answer
to Minnie and Roman's problem, too.

1014
01:34:27,278 --> 01:34:30,805
- What do you mean?
- Roman's very ill.

1015
01:34:31,015 --> 01:34:34,951
Confidentially, he has no more
than a month or two left.

1016
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:37,815
He wanted to visit
his favourite cities.

1017
01:34:37,989 --> 01:34:41,356
They didn't want to offend you
by leaving before the birth.

1018
01:34:41,526 --> 01:34:43,687
I'm sorry to hear that.

1019
01:34:43,861 --> 01:34:47,228
He'd be extremely embarrassed
if he knew you found out.

1020
01:34:47,398 --> 01:34:49,832
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.

1021
01:34:50,001 --> 01:34:52,401
I'll say I spoke to you.

1022
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:56,028
- Will they leave on Sunday?
- I'll see to it.

1023
01:34:58,843 --> 01:35:04,509
Our thoughts are gonna be with you
till you're all happy and thin again,

1024
01:35:04,682 --> 01:35:07,651
your sweet little boy or girl
laying safely in your arms.

1025
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:11,653
- Thanks for everything.
- Make Guy send us lots of pictures.

1026
01:35:11,823 --> 01:35:13,188
I will.

1027
01:35:13,358 --> 01:35:16,020
I won't wish you luck
because you won't need it.

1028
01:35:16,194 --> 01:35:18,594
You'll have a happy life.

1029
01:35:18,763 --> 01:35:21,288
Have a good trip
and come back safely.

1030
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:26,870
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik
or Pescara, or maybe Majorca.

1031
01:35:27,038 --> 01:35:29,529
- We shall see, we shall see.
- Come back.

1032
01:35:29,741 --> 01:35:31,709
- Bye, Minnie.
- Yeah.

1033
01:35:31,876 --> 01:35:34,970
Goodbye, Roman. Bye-bye. Take care.

1034
01:35:35,179 --> 01:35:39,513
- Kennedy Airport, Pan Am Building.
- Bye, Minnie. Bye, Roman.

1035
01:35:42,587 --> 01:35:44,316
Oh, boy.

1036
01:35:51,596 --> 01:35:54,326
Where's my book?

1037
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:59,061
- I put it in the garbage.
- What?

1038
01:35:59,237 --> 01:36:01,797
I didn't want you upsetting yourself.

1039
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,442
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.

1040
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:08,272
- I wasn't thinking of that.
- That's terrible.

1041
01:36:08,446 --> 01:36:11,108
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

1042
01:36:18,389 --> 01:36:20,084
Watch out, lady!

1043
01:37:14,145 --> 01:37:16,010
"In some cults, it was believed

1044
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:19,411
"that a personal possession
of the victim was necessary

1045
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:24,419
"and spells cannot be cast without
one of the victim's belongings."

1046
01:37:26,157 --> 01:37:29,058
- Is this Donald Baumgart?
- <i>That's right. </i>

1047
01:37:29,227 --> 01:37:32,128
This is Rosemary Woodhouse,
Guy Woodhouse's wife.

1048
01:37:32,296 --> 01:37:35,424
- <i>Oh, yes! </i>
- I want to know...

1049
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,730
<i>You must be a happy lady, </i>
<i>living in the Bram... </i>

1050
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:45,034
- I wanted to know how you are.
- <i>Well, bless your heart. </i>

1051
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:47,543
<i>Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh? </i>

1052
01:37:47,712 --> 01:37:52,012
<i>Well, I'm splendid. </i>
<i>I've only broke six glasses today. </i>

1053
01:37:53,718 --> 01:37:55,686
Guy and I are both very unhappy

1054
01:37:55,853 --> 01:37:59,619
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1055
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:07,097
<i>What the hell. </i>
<i>That's the way it goes, right? </i>

1056
01:38:07,265 --> 01:38:11,361
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.

1057
01:38:11,536 --> 01:38:17,497
<i>Visit? No... You mean</i>
<i>the day we met for drinks? </i>

1058
01:38:17,675 --> 01:38:20,610
Yes, that's what I meant.

1059
01:38:20,778 --> 01:38:23,474
By the way,
he has something of yours, you know.

1060
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,616
<i>What do you mean? </i>

1061
01:38:25,783 --> 01:38:28,183
- Don't you know?
- <i>No. </i>

1062
01:38:28,352 --> 01:38:30,980
Didn't you miss anything that day?

1063
01:38:32,056 --> 01:38:35,651
- <i>You don't mean my tie, do you? </i>
- Yes.

1064
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,888
<i>Well, he's got mine, </i>
<i>and I've got his. </i>

1065
01:38:40,064 --> 01:38:42,123
- <i>He can have it back. </i>
- I'm sorry...

1066
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:46,361
<i>Doesn't matter to me now</i>
<i>what colour tie I wear. </i>

1067
01:38:46,571 --> 01:38:52,168
- I thought he'd only borrowed it.
- <i>No, no. It was a trade. </i>

1068
01:38:52,376 --> 01:38:57,245
- <i>Or... do you think he stole it? </i>
- I have to hang up now.

1069
01:38:57,415 --> 01:39:00,384
I just wanted to know
if there'd been any improvement.

1070
01:39:00,551 --> 01:39:04,783
<i>No, there isn't. </i>
<i>It was nice of you to call. </i>

1071
01:39:42,193 --> 01:39:46,721
- You aren't in labour?
- No, but I have to see the doctor.

1072
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:50,664
But he has to leave at five,
and there is Mrs Byron.

1073
01:39:50,835 --> 01:39:54,601
- I'm sure he'll see you. Sit down.
- Thank you.

1074
01:40:15,726 --> 01:40:19,719
- How is it out there?
- Awful. 94.

1075
01:40:21,198 --> 01:40:22,961
See you next week.
Make an appointment.

1076
01:40:23,134 --> 01:40:24,601
I will.

1077
01:40:30,408 --> 01:40:32,672
- You're due any day, aren't you?
- Tuesday.

1078
01:40:32,843 --> 01:40:36,108
Smart to get it over with
before August.

1079
01:40:37,648 --> 01:40:40,845
Mrs Byron? He'll see you right after.

1080
01:40:41,986 --> 01:40:45,478
Well, let's see... July the 10th?

1081
01:40:45,656 --> 01:40:48,420
- What time?
- Four o'clock? All right.

1082
01:40:50,494 --> 01:40:54,089
- Bye-bye. Good luck.
- Thank you.

1083
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,838
That smells nice. What is it?

1084
01:41:05,876 --> 01:41:09,277
Oh, my... It's called Detchema.

1085
01:41:09,447 --> 01:41:13,110
It's better than your regular,
if you don't mind my saying.

1086
01:41:13,284 --> 01:41:16,685
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.

1087
01:41:16,854 --> 01:41:20,290
Good. Maybe the doctor
will follow your example.

1088
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:29,398
- Dr Sapirstein?
- Yes. The aftershave.

1089
01:41:29,567 --> 01:41:32,934
But it isn't, is it? I don't think
he has a good luck charm.

1090
01:41:33,137 --> 01:41:38,473
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while. And when he does...

1091
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,877
- Haven't you ever noticed?
- No.

1092
01:41:43,047 --> 01:41:45,948
Maybe you thought it was your own
you were smelling.

1093
01:41:46,117 --> 01:41:48,347
What is it, a chemical thing?

1094
01:41:49,387 --> 01:41:53,380
Will you excuse me a moment, please?
My husband is waiting outside.

1095
01:41:53,557 --> 01:41:56,117
I have to go and tell him something.
I'll be back.

1096
01:42:45,309 --> 01:42:47,607
- <i>Dr Hill's office. </i>
- Dr Hill, please.

1097
01:42:47,778 --> 01:42:52,442
<i>This is his answering service. </i>
<i>Would you like to leave a message? </i>

1098
01:42:53,684 --> 01:42:56,118
Yes. My name
is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1099
01:42:56,287 --> 01:43:02,055
Woodhouse. Would you ask him to
call me back right away, please?

1100
01:43:02,226 --> 01:43:07,163
My number is 475-2598.

1101
01:43:07,331 --> 01:43:09,128
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1102
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,927
<i>All right. </i>

1103
01:43:20,711 --> 01:43:23,908
Quickly, please, Dr Hill, call me.

1104
01:43:30,254 --> 01:43:36,284
Oh, really? Did he really say that?
He didn't say that?

1105
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,928
What else was it that he said?

1106
01:43:39,096 --> 01:43:43,760
That's wonderful.
That's wonder... That's marvellous.

1107
01:43:43,934 --> 01:43:44,992
Yes. Dr Hill?

1108
01:43:45,169 --> 01:43:48,468
- <i>Is it Rosemary Woodhouse? </i>
- Yes.

1109
01:43:48,672 --> 01:43:52,301
- <i>Are you Dr Hill's patient? </i>
- No.

1110
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:55,968
Yes. I mean, well,
I've seen him once.

1111
01:43:56,180 --> 01:44:00,116
Please tell him he has
to speak to me. It's important.

1112
01:44:00,284 --> 01:44:02,013
- Tell him to call me, hm?
- <i>All right. </i>

1113
01:44:02,186 --> 01:44:03,346
Thank you.

1114
01:44:10,694 --> 01:44:13,788
All of them. All of them.

1115
01:44:13,964 --> 01:44:18,697
All in it together. All of them.
All of them witches.

1116
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:21,465
Don't worry, little Andy or Jenny,

1117
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:24,835
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.

1118
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:31,109
- Yes. Dr...
- <i>Mrs Woodhouse? </i>

1119
01:44:31,282 --> 01:44:34,774
Yes!
Thank you, thank you for calling me.

1120
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:37,648
<i>I thought you were in California. </i>

1121
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:42,884
No. I've been to another doctor,
and he isn't good, Dr Hill.

1122
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:48,794
He's been lying to me and giving me
unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.

1123
01:44:48,966 --> 01:44:52,231
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me June 28th?

1124
01:44:52,403 --> 01:44:55,566
- I want you to deliver it.
- <i>Mrs Woodhouse... </i>

1125
01:44:55,773 --> 01:45:00,540
Please, let me talk to you.
Let me explain what's been going on.

1126
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:05,080
I can't stay too long here.
They'll be coming, looking for me.

1127
01:45:05,249 --> 01:45:09,913
Dr Hill, there's a plot...
I know that sounds crazy.

1128
01:45:10,087 --> 01:45:13,215
You're probably thinking,
"This girl has flipped,"

1129
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:18,157
but I haven't flipped,
Dr Hill, I swear, by all the saints.

1130
01:45:18,329 --> 01:45:21,059
There are plots against people,
aren't there?

1131
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:26,169
- <i>I suppose there are. </i>
- There's one against me and my baby.

1132
01:45:27,471 --> 01:45:31,931
- <i>Come see me tomorrow after five. </i>
- Now! Right now.

1133
01:45:33,043 --> 01:45:36,501
<i>Mrs Woodhouse, I'm home. I've</i>
<i>been up since yesterday morning... </i>

1134
01:45:36,714 --> 01:45:39,683
I beg you. I beg you.

1135
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,053
I can't stay here.

1136
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:47,015
- <i>My office at eight o'clock. </i>
- Thank you!

1137
01:45:47,191 --> 01:45:49,716
- Oh, wait! Dr Hill?
- <i>Yes? </i>

1138
01:45:49,893 --> 01:45:53,488
- My husband may call you...
- <i>I'm not gonna speak to anyone. </i>

1139
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:56,531
- <i>I'm gonna take a nap. </i>
- Thank you.

1140
01:46:29,733 --> 01:46:31,428
Keep the change.

1141
01:46:32,503 --> 01:46:38,135
Driver, please, could you wait
and watch until I'm inside the door?

1142
01:46:54,391 --> 01:46:57,360
He lied.
He said we were going to Hollywood.

1143
01:46:57,528 --> 01:47:00,122
The worst thing is he's involved.

1144
01:47:00,898 --> 01:47:03,765
He sleeps in pyjamas now.
He never used to.

1145
01:47:03,934 --> 01:47:05,265
He's probably hiding a mark.

1146
01:47:05,436 --> 01:47:09,236
They give you marks when you join...
all sorts of rituals.

1147
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:13,376
They hold Sabbaths there.
You could hear them.

1148
01:47:13,544 --> 01:47:16,240
Guy, my husband,
said it was Dr Shand,

1149
01:47:16,413 --> 01:47:19,007
one of them playing a recorder.

1150
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:24,621
Now, how did he know it was Dr Shand
unless he was there with them?

1151
01:47:24,788 --> 01:47:26,653
They're very clever people.

1152
01:47:26,824 --> 01:47:29,156
They planned everything
from the beginning.

1153
01:47:29,326 --> 01:47:32,193
They probably made
some deal with Guy.

1154
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:33,455
They gave him success,

1155
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:37,396
and he promised them our baby
to use in their rituals.

1156
01:47:38,569 --> 01:47:43,768
I know this sounds crazy,
but I've got books here. Look.

1157
01:47:44,842 --> 01:47:48,209
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart,

1158
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:54,682
they put a spell on him and made
him blind so Guy could get his part.

1159
01:47:54,852 --> 01:47:56,376
Look, here.

1160
01:47:58,756 --> 01:48:02,351
I had this friend,
Edward Hutchins, a writer.

1161
01:48:02,526 --> 01:48:04,187
He wrote stories for boys.

1162
01:48:04,361 --> 01:48:07,296
He was my good friend
since I first came to New York.

1163
01:48:07,464 --> 01:48:09,762
- May I keep this?
- Yes, please.

1164
01:48:09,933 --> 01:48:15,098
And, look. Anyway,
once Mr Hutchins came to visit me...

1165
01:48:15,305 --> 01:48:19,605
It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1166
01:48:19,777 --> 01:48:23,269
I was suffering so... You can't
imagine how much I was suffering,

1167
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,539
and they wouldn't help me.

1168
01:48:25,716 --> 01:48:28,844
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.

1169
01:48:29,019 --> 01:48:31,852
Also witches' stuff, tannis root.

1170
01:48:32,022 --> 01:48:34,923
Hutch came and immediately
saw something was wrong.

1171
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:37,458
He knew about witches.

1172
01:48:37,628 --> 01:48:41,530
Guy rushed in with his makeup on,
which he never did.

1173
01:48:41,698 --> 01:48:45,964
They probably called him to come home
and steal one of Hutch's belongings.

1174
01:48:46,136 --> 01:48:49,867
He took his glove
and they put a spell on him, too.

1175
01:48:50,073 --> 01:48:53,975
Put him in a coma.
Three months later he died.

1176
01:48:54,845 --> 01:48:58,178
Maybe all this is coincidence,
but one thing is for sure,

1177
01:48:58,348 --> 01:49:01,340
they have a coven and want my baby.

1178
01:49:04,154 --> 01:49:06,645
Certainly seems that way.

1179
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,231
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

1180
01:49:18,402 --> 01:49:19,994
I don't believe in witchcraft,

1181
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:23,867
but there are plenty
of crazy people in this city.

1182
01:49:24,074 --> 01:49:28,841
- The doctor's name is Shand?
- No, Dr Shand is one of them.

1183
01:49:29,012 --> 01:49:33,312
- The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
- Abraham Sapirstein?

1184
01:49:34,585 --> 01:49:40,490
- Yeah. Do you know him?
- I've met him once or twice.

1185
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:42,215
To look at him, you'd never think...

1186
01:49:42,392 --> 01:49:45,623
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

1187
01:49:45,796 --> 01:49:49,493
Would you like to go
into Mount Sinai now, this evening?

1188
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:52,965
I would love to.
Would that be possible?

1189
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:56,037
It's difficult, but we'll try.

1190
01:49:56,206 --> 01:49:58,367
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.

1191
01:49:58,575 --> 01:50:03,171
Thanks. Anything they've got,
even a broom closet would be fine.

1192
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,679
I hope we can do better than that.

1193
01:50:11,822 --> 01:50:14,791
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.

1194
01:50:17,628 --> 01:50:19,323
Should I undress now?

1195
01:50:19,496 --> 01:50:23,830
No. It'll take about a half hour.
You just lie down, rest.

1196
01:50:36,647 --> 01:50:39,411
God bless Dr Hill.

1197
01:50:44,988 --> 01:50:48,617
Everything's going to be OK now,
Andy or Jenny.

1198
01:50:48,792 --> 01:50:54,230
We're going to be in a nice,
clean hospital with no visitors.

1199
01:51:15,152 --> 01:51:17,052
Monsters.

1200
01:51:19,623 --> 01:51:21,784
Monsters.

1201
01:51:24,394 --> 01:51:28,353
Unspeakable. Unspeakable.

1202
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:02,489
I was sleeping.

1203
01:52:16,647 --> 01:52:20,811
Come with us quietly, Rosemary.
Don't argue or make a scene.

1204
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:23,248
If you say
anything more about witches

1205
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:26,116
we'll take you to a mental hospital.

1206
01:52:26,289 --> 01:52:29,452
You don't want that, do you?
So put your shoes on.

1207
01:52:29,626 --> 01:52:32,720
We just want to take you home.
No one's going to hurt you.

1208
01:52:32,896 --> 01:52:35,626
Or the baby. Put your shoes on.

1209
01:52:54,451 --> 01:52:56,078
She's fine now.

1210
01:52:56,253 --> 01:52:59,450
- We're going to go home and rest.
- That's all it takes.

1211
01:52:59,623 --> 01:53:02,956
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Glad I could help, sir.

1212
01:53:03,126 --> 01:53:04,787
It's a shame you had to come here.

1213
01:53:58,248 --> 01:54:00,478
Good evening, Mrs Woodhouse.

1214
01:54:15,565 --> 01:54:19,194
Mrs Woodhouse! Mrs Woodhouse!

1215
01:55:35,879 --> 01:55:37,642
- Come on, open up, Ro.
- Go to hell!

1216
01:55:37,814 --> 01:55:41,045
- Come on, honey.
- You promised them the baby!

1217
01:55:41,218 --> 01:55:43,709
I didn't promise them anything!

1218
01:55:43,887 --> 01:55:47,186
- Rosemary, you're...
- You, too!

1219
01:56:19,656 --> 01:56:21,783
- Elise?
- <i>Mrs Dunstan is out. </i>

1220
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:23,050
- Who is this?
- <i>The babysitter. </i>

1221
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:26,161
- Where is she?
- <i>At the movies. </i>

1222
01:56:26,329 --> 01:56:30,060
This is Rosemary. Ask her to call me
when she gets home.

1223
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,794
It's terribly urgent. Don't forget.

1224
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:37,235
- <i>Don't worry. I'll tell her. </i>
- Thank you.

1225
01:56:43,446 --> 01:56:48,213
- We don't want to hurt you, Ro.
- We're your friends, Rosemary.

1226
01:56:48,385 --> 01:56:51,786
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Honest there isn't.

1227
01:56:51,955 --> 01:56:56,221
- This is just a mild sedative.
- I wouldn't let anyone...

1228
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:02,364
Help me!

1229
01:57:02,532 --> 01:57:05,831
- Ro, baby.
- Somebody help me!

1230
01:57:17,213 --> 01:57:20,580
Wait a minute. Wait a minute now.

1231
01:57:26,356 --> 01:57:29,484
- We're in labour here.
- Here?

1232
01:57:29,659 --> 01:57:33,459
You'll be all right, baby. You're
going to be perfectly all right.

1233
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:36,895
There were supposed to be
doctors, hospitals!

1234
01:57:39,235 --> 01:57:41,703
Everything clean and sterile!

1235
01:57:42,339 --> 01:57:45,536
Hello? She isn't here, Elise.

1236
01:57:52,248 --> 01:57:55,445
Andy... Andy or Jenny...

1237
01:57:57,253 --> 01:58:01,917
I'm sorry, my little darling.
Forgive me.

1238
01:58:13,603 --> 01:58:15,594
Hi.

1239
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:21,602
Hi.

1240
01:58:23,413 --> 01:58:29,909
- Is it all right?
- Yes, it's fine.

1241
01:58:32,155 --> 01:58:35,420
- What is it?
- A boy.

1242
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:42,724
Really? A boy?

1243
01:58:52,609 --> 01:58:55,874
- And it's all right?
- Yes.

1244
01:59:15,932 --> 01:59:20,301
- Where is it?
- My goodness!

1245
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:23,132
Gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.

1246
01:59:23,339 --> 01:59:28,743
- The baby, where is it?
- You wait here one minute.

1247
01:59:30,713 --> 01:59:36,208
- Where's my baby?
- I'll go find Dr Abe. Just wait.

1248
01:59:52,635 --> 01:59:55,126
Where's the baby?

1249
01:59:57,373 --> 02:00:00,433
- Where is it?
- Honey...

1250
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:05,247
There were complications, but nothing
that will affect future births.

1251
02:00:08,885 --> 02:00:14,653
- It's...
- Dead. It was in the wrong position.

1252
02:00:14,824 --> 02:00:17,349
In hospital
I might have done something.

1253
02:00:17,527 --> 02:00:20,860
Honey, we can have others.

1254
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:23,396
You can try again in a few months.

1255
02:00:23,566 --> 02:00:24,931
When you're better.

1256
02:00:25,101 --> 02:00:29,765
No. I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

1257
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:34,740
You're lying! It didn't die!
You took it! You're lying!

1258
02:00:34,911 --> 02:00:40,781
You're witches! You're lying!
You're lying! You're lying!

1259
02:00:51,294 --> 02:00:54,525
Abe says it's called pre-partum.

1260
02:00:54,697 --> 02:00:58,360
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

1261
02:00:58,535 --> 02:01:01,993
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.

1262
02:01:06,142 --> 02:01:10,772
I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,

1263
02:01:10,947 --> 02:01:15,179
but how come you thought
that Abe and I joined the party?

1264
02:01:20,123 --> 02:01:24,560
Let's face it, darling,
you had the pre-partum crazies.

1265
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:29,298
Now you're gonna rest
and you're gonna get over them.

1266
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:33,696
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

1267
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:36,168
but now everything's gonna be roses.

1268
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:40,706
Paramount's right where we want them,
Universal's interested,

1269
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:44,313
and we're gonna blow this town
and be in beautiful Beverly

1270
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,744
with a pool and a spice garden,

1271
02:01:46,916 --> 02:01:49,646
the whole schmeer, and kids, too, Ro.

1272
02:01:49,819 --> 02:01:52,515
Scout's honour.
You heard what Abe said.

1273
02:01:56,359 --> 02:01:59,089
Now, I got to run now and get famous.

1274
02:02:01,965 --> 02:02:04,661
Let me see your shoulder.

1275
02:02:07,637 --> 02:02:09,195
Let me see your shoulder.

1276
02:02:09,405 --> 02:02:12,704
- Are you kidding?
- Your left shoulder.

1277
02:02:13,743 --> 02:02:16,268
All right. Anything you say.

1278
02:02:19,182 --> 02:02:23,642
I generally prefer doing this
to music. Left shoulder.

1279
02:02:26,689 --> 02:02:28,316
Right shoulder.

1280
02:02:31,261 --> 02:02:34,594
That's as far as I go
without a blue light.

1281
02:02:39,402 --> 02:02:42,701
<i>The high pressure area</i>
<i>has been causing this heat, </i>

1282
02:02:42,905 --> 02:02:48,400
<i>and will be staying with us</i>
<i>through the week. </i>

1283
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:52,047
<i>It will be overcast</i>
<i>upstate New York as well, </i>

1284
02:02:52,215 --> 02:02:55,309
<i>with the possibility</i>
<i>of thunder showers tonight</i>

1285
02:02:55,485 --> 02:02:58,181
<i>clearing by tomorrow night. </i>

1286
02:02:58,354 --> 02:03:03,155
<i>All you people leaving the city</i>
<i>this weekend should find it hot. </i>

1287
02:03:26,015 --> 02:03:29,416
Do you hear a baby crying?

1288
02:03:29,585 --> 02:03:31,678
Why, no, I don't, dear.

1289
02:03:32,355 --> 02:03:36,485
Now, into your bed now.
It's time for you to take your pill.

1290
02:03:46,202 --> 02:03:48,796
Did you turn the air conditioner off?

1291
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:51,200
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.

1292
02:03:51,407 --> 02:03:53,932
People are actually dying,
it's so hot.

1293
02:04:09,859 --> 02:04:11,190
What do you do with the milk?

1294
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:15,457
Why, throw it away.
Your pill, Rosemary.

1295
02:04:25,341 --> 02:04:29,675
Hello, girls. 95 out.

1296
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:33,779
Some new people
moved on in up in eight.

1297
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:38,751
- Do they have a baby?
- How'd you know that?

1298
02:04:40,690 --> 02:04:43,318
I heard it crying.

1299
02:04:43,493 --> 02:04:45,120
Wait a minute.

1300
02:04:48,498 --> 02:04:52,457
- No. Don't do that.
- Why not?

1301
02:04:54,437 --> 02:04:57,565
A little messy, that's all.

1302
02:07:46,709 --> 02:07:49,109
Easy, easy.

1303
02:08:05,895 --> 02:08:08,625
Got her too high.

1304
02:08:33,756 --> 02:08:36,850
Hell, Hayato.
You're making fun of me.

1305
02:08:36,993 --> 02:08:39,757
You're pulling my leg, like we say.

1306
02:09:08,958 --> 02:09:13,224
Rosemary, go back to bed. You know
you're not supposed to be up.

1307
02:09:13,396 --> 02:09:15,626
- The mother?
- Rosemary...

1308
02:09:15,798 --> 02:09:19,996
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.

1309
02:10:04,246 --> 02:10:06,646
What have you done to it?

1310
02:10:06,816 --> 02:10:08,807
What have you done to its eyes?

1311
02:10:08,984 --> 02:10:11,509
He has his father's eyes.

1312
02:10:16,292 --> 02:10:19,659
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.

1313
02:10:19,829 --> 02:10:22,923
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?!

1314
02:10:23,099 --> 02:10:25,863
Satan is his father, not Guy.

1315
02:10:26,035 --> 02:10:29,368
He came up from hell
and begat a son of mortal woman.

1316
02:10:29,572 --> 02:10:31,267
- Hail, Satan.
- Hail, Satan.

1317
02:10:31,474 --> 02:10:35,342
Satan is his father,
and his name is Adrian.

1318
02:10:35,511 --> 02:10:38,605
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

1319
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:40,840
He shall redeem the despised,

1320
02:10:41,016 --> 02:10:45,385
and wreak vengeance in the name
of the burned and the tortured!

1321
02:10:45,554 --> 02:10:47,283
Hail, Adrian!

1322
02:10:47,456 --> 02:10:49,947
Hail, Satan! Hail, Satan!

1323
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:55,626
He chose you. Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.

1324
02:10:55,798 --> 02:10:59,131
He wanted you to be
the mother of his only son.

1325
02:10:59,301 --> 02:11:01,735
His power is stronger than stronger!

1326
02:11:01,937 --> 02:11:03,928
His might shall last
longer than longer!

1327
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:06,438
Hail, Satan!

1328
02:11:06,609 --> 02:11:10,875
No! It can't be!

1329
02:11:13,015 --> 02:11:15,711
- Go look at his hands.
- And his feet.

1330
02:11:17,853 --> 02:11:20,151
Oh, God!

1331
02:11:21,657 --> 02:11:26,720
God is dead! Satan lives!
The year is one!

1332
02:11:28,230 --> 02:11:30,994
The year is one and God is done!

1333
02:11:31,167 --> 02:11:34,762
- The year is one!
- Hail, Adrian!

1334
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:38,072
Hail, Satan!

1335
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:42,540
Why don't you help us out, Rosemary?
Be a real mother to Adrian.

1336
02:11:42,711 --> 02:11:44,542
You don't have to join
if you don't want to.

1337
02:11:44,713 --> 02:11:47,773
Just be a mother to your baby.

1338
02:11:48,918 --> 02:11:54,015
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
It's not right.

1339
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:59,056
Think about it, Rosemary.

1340
02:12:11,574 --> 02:12:13,235
Oh, God!

1341
02:12:13,442 --> 02:12:16,036
Shut up or we'll kill you,
milk or no milk.

1342
02:12:16,245 --> 02:12:19,772
You shut up. Rosemary's his mother.
Show some respect.

1343
02:12:22,952 --> 02:12:26,979
Come, my friend.
Come see him. Come see the child.

1344
02:12:37,466 --> 02:12:40,196
What would you like to drink?

1345
02:12:40,369 --> 02:12:45,272
They promised you wouldn't be hurt,
and you haven't been, really.

1346
02:12:46,709 --> 02:12:50,702
I mean, supposing you had the baby
and you lost it.

1347
02:12:50,913 --> 02:12:52,904
Wouldn't that be the same?

1348
02:12:53,082 --> 02:12:55,949
And we're getting
so much in return, Ro.

1349
02:13:06,295 --> 02:13:10,595
Guy, let me introduce
you to Argyron Stavropoulos.

1350
02:13:10,766 --> 02:13:16,227
How proud you must be. Is this
the mother? Why in the name of...

1351
02:13:16,405 --> 02:13:19,966
- Here, drink this.
- What's in it? Tannis root?

1352
02:13:20,175 --> 02:13:24,111
Just plain, ordinary Lipton's tea.
You drink it.

1353
02:13:56,011 --> 02:14:00,505
- Get away from here. Roman!
- You're rocking him too fast.

1354
02:14:00,683 --> 02:14:03,413
Sit down! Put her where she belongs.

1355
02:14:03,585 --> 02:14:06,247
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.

1356
02:14:06,422 --> 02:14:09,391
- Mind your own business.
- Let Rosemary rock him.

1357
02:14:09,558 --> 02:14:12,618
- Sit with the others.
- She's liable to...

1358
02:14:12,795 --> 02:14:15,593
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.

1359
02:14:25,808 --> 02:14:27,400
Rock him.

1360
02:14:29,678 --> 02:14:33,114
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.
