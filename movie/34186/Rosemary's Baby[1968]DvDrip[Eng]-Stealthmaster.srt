1
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,714
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

2
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,466
He's an actor.

3
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:29,370
We're very popular with actors.

4
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:31,728
Have I seen you in anything?

5
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:34,712
I did Hamlet a while back, didn't I?

6
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,872
And then we did The Sandpiper.

7
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:40,558
He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves An Albatross

8
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,753
and a lot of TV commercials.

9
00:02:42,924 --> 00:02:46,963
- That's where the money is.
- And the artistic thrills, too.

10
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:55,269
Seven, Diego.

11
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:59,553
The apartments have been broken
into fours, fives and six es.

12
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:03,205
Seven-E is a four,
originally the back part of a 10.

13
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:06,402
The original dining room
is its living room,

14
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:11,971
and two servants' rooms together
are a dining room or second bedroom.

15
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,958
Do you have children?

16
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,111
We plan to.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,956
We must oil that gate, Diego.

18
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,797
This way, please.

19
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,388
The previous tenant,
Mrs Gardenia, died a few days ago,

20
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,995
so nothing has been moved yet.

21
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,860
The furniture could be had
practically for asking.

22
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:44,825
Did she die in the apartment?

23
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,901
Oh, no, no, no. In a hospital.

24
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,457
She' d been in a coma for weeks.

25
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:52,408
- After you, please.
- Thank you.

26
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:55,846
She was very old
and passed away without waking.

27
00:03:56,077 --> 00:04:01,356
I' d be grateful to go that way
myself when the time comes.

28
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,863
Oh, no, no, no.
Not in the apartment, no.

29
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,200
She was chipper right to the end.

30
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,212
One of the first women
lawyers in New York.

31
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:13,972
- Did a little gardening, too.
- She was quite a woman.

32
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:17,893
Oh, closet. Plenty of closets.

33
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,297
A nice view of the park.

34
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:23,909
- Very nice view.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,776
This room would make
a lovely nursery.

36
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,495
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper
would brighten it.

37
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,851
- What are all these things?
- Herbs, mostly.

38
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,947
Nice large bathroom.

39
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:39,868
- Mint, basil.
- Yeah. No marijuana?

40
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:49,626
The master bedroom.

41
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:52,910
- Oh, yes.
- Back at the hallway again.

42
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,483
There.

43
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:59,856
- Oh... Oh, Guy!
- Yeah.

44
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,848
- Ohh!
- The fireplace works, of course.

45
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:05,490
- Great.
- Oh!

46
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:08,437
It's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!

47
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,478
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent.

48
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,203
We' d raise it if we were allowed.

49
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,994
Apartments with this kind of charm...

50
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:21,539
Why, that's odd.

51
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:27,466
There's a closet
behind that secretary.

52
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,460
I'm sure there is.

53
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,499
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.

54
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,124
She moved it. It used to be there.

55
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,894
Give me a hand, will you?

56
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:13,391
I see now why she went into a coma.

57
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,816
She couldn't have lifted it
by herself. She was 89.

58
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:20,838
Should we open it?
Maybe her son should.

59
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:26,601
I'm authorised to show the apartment.

60
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:29,835
- Well!
- Whatever she locked in got out.

61
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,649
Perhaps she
didn't need five closets.

62
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:36,397
Why cover up her
vacuum cleaner and her towels?

63
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:38,760
I don't suppose we'll ever know.

64
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:42,294
Maybe she was becoming senile.
Anything else?

65
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:44,753
What about laundry facilities?

66
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:46,899
It's bigger than the other one.

67
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,948
Yeah.
It's more expensive, too, you know?

68
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:51,714
It's better located.

69
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:55,222
Yeah, I could walk to all
the theatres from here.

70
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:57,490
Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?

71
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:00,098
That living room could be...
Oh, please!

72
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,247
OK. We get out
of the other lease, OK.

73
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:07,075
I was tempted to write
that you were drug addicts.

74
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:10,813
Instead, I decided to lie
and say you were wonderful.

75
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:14,407
- You're great, Hutch.
- Could I talk you out of it?

76
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:17,471
- He's pulling your leg.
- Indeed I'm not.

77
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:19,161
That looks great.

78
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,940
You know the Bramford
had rather an unpleasant reputation?

79
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,985
It's where the Trench sisters
conducted their dietary experiments

80
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:31,631
and Keith Kennedy held his parties.

81
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,176
Adrian Marcato lived there, too...

82
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,754
- Trench sisters?
- Adrian Marcato?

83
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,308
The Trench sisters were two Victorian
ladies. They ate young children.

84
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:46,093
- Lovely.
- Marcato practised witchcraft.

85
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:51,010
He made quite a splash by announcing
he' d conjured up the living devil.

86
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:56,735
People attacked and nearly killed him
in the lobby of the Bramford.

87
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:58,121
You're joking?

88
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:02,734
Later, after the Keith Kennedy
business, the house was half empty.

89
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,133
I didn't know
that Marcato lived there.

90
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,390
World War II
filled the house up again.

91
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,119
Terrific.

92
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,869
- The house?
- The lamb.

93
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:16,059
It's called Black Bramford.

94
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:19,388
Awful things happen
in every apartment house.

95
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:23,575
This house has
a lot of unpleasant happenings.

96
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:28,424
In '59, a dead infant was found,
wrapped in newspaper in the basement.

97
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:31,346
You really rouse my appetite.

98
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,898
Have some more wine.

99
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:11,873
Roman!

100
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,476
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!

101
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:52,377
Hey, these are shelves.

102
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:09,324
Hey... let's make love.

103
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,417
I think I hear the
Trench sisters chewing.

104
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:54,492
Straight up to the left.

105
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:59,129
Here in Daytona, Florida,
it's the 250cc 100-mile classic

106
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:05,082
with Yamaha leading and winning it,
taking seven of the top 10 places.

107
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:09,199
It's the third straight year
for Yamaha, a clean sweep.

108
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:14,485
Yamaha is race-bred from champions,
with a model for all kinds of riding.

109
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:19,186
You should discover the swingin'
world of Yamaha. Have a ride.

110
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:22,616
- Come on. Get on.
- OK, come on. Let's go.

111
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:29,577
Look.

112
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,319
It's great.

113
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:56,501
I'm sorry. I thought you were
Victoria Vetri, the actress.

114
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,104
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:01,449
That's OK.
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.

116
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:04,823
- I don't see any resemblance.
- Do you know her?

117
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,402
No.

118
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:12,373
- My name's Terry Gionoffrio.
- Hi, I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

119
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,759
- We're new tenants.
- I'm staying with the Castevets.

120
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,975
I'm their guest, sort of.

121
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,614
Our apartment was the back of yours.

122
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,853
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs...?

123
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,947
- Yeah... Gardenia.
- Gardenia. Yeah.

124
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,943
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
for her to cook with.

125
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,431
- I saw them.
- Now she grows her own.

126
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:38,620
Ex cuse me, I have to add softener.

127
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,790
- What does your husband do?
- He's an actor.

128
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,469
- What's his name?
- Guy Woodhouse.

129
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,505
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves An
Albatross, and he does a lot of TV.

130
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,315
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
I bet I've seen him.

131
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,655
- I hate this basement.
- Yeah, me, too.

132
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:01,683
It gives me the creeps.

133
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:04,845
Let's come down
together and do our laundry.

134
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,578
That' d be great.

135
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:10,886
I have a good luck charm.
It might work for both of us.

136
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:13,887
- That's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

137
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,268
Mrs Castevet gave it to me.

138
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:20,888
It's supposed to be good luck.
It's got some stuff inside.

139
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:27,917
I'm not mad about the smell either.
I hope it works.

140
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:31,602
It's beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it.

141
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,992
European. The Castevets are the most
wonderful people in the world.

142
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,730
- They picked me up off the sidewalk.
- You were sick?

143
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:43,204
I was starving, on dope
and a lot of other things.

144
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:45,948
I'm like the daughter they never had.

145
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:48,817
At first,
I thought they wanted me for sex,

146
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:51,537
but they're like real grandparents.

147
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,293
I'm glad there are people like that.

148
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:58,764
You hear so much about apathy, people
who are afraid of getting involved.

149
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,343
I' d be dead now without them.
That's a fact. Dead or in jail.

150
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:06,656
You don't have any family
that could help?

151
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,544
A brother in the navy.

152
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,461
It's impossible to be 100%sure!

153
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:16,265
If you want my opinion, we shouldn't
tell her! That's my opinion!

154
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,505
That must be the partition.

155
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:22,668
That's the back part of the original
10 with a dining room,

156
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:26,921
and there's...a closet here,
and then there's a closet over here.

157
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,717
Stay back, huh, lady?

158
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:18,587
Get back, please.
There's nothing to see.

159
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,692
Get back, will you, please?

160
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:25,606
- Jesus.
- Get back!

161
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:28,620
- We know her.
- What's her name?

162
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,941
- Terry.
- Terry what?

163
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:35,791
Ro? What was her name again?
Terry what?

164
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,793
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.

165
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,231
She was staying with
some people named Castevet.

166
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,180
Yeah. We got that already.

167
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,332
Short and sweet. She stuck it
to the window with a Band-Aid.

168
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:51,427
- Come on. Get back.
- Theresa Gionoffrio.

169
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:53,833
Move on! Move on!

170
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,068
- You knew her?
- Only slightly.

171
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,659
- Come on, Ro, baby. Let's go.
- Oh! Here they come.

172
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,822
You folks the Castevets?

173
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,380
We are.

174
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,679
You have a Theresa Gionoffrio
living with you?

175
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,216
We do. Has there been an accident?

176
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,684
Brace yourself for some bad news.

177
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,384
She's dead. Jumped out of the window.

178
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,015
That's not possible! It's a mistake!

179
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,838
Artie, you want to let these folks
take a look, please?

180
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,378
I knew this would happen.

181
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,257
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

182
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,661
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.

183
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,528
That doesn't mean she killed herself.

184
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,354
She was a happy girl,
no reason for self-destruction.

185
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:47,755
- Must've been cleaning the windows.
- At midnight?

186
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:51,414
- Why not? Maybe she was!
- Is that her handwriting?

187
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,763
- Yeah.
- Definitely. Absolutely.

188
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,305
I'll see this gets back to you
when we're done.

189
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:03,652
I don't believe it. I just
don't believe it. She was so happy.

190
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:08,032
- Who 's the next-of-kin?
- She didn't have anybody, only us.

191
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:11,126
- She had a brother.
- Did she?

192
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:14,647
- In the navy.
- News to me.

193
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:18,397
- Where is he stationed?
- I don't know.

194
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:22,754
She mentioned him to me in the
laundry room. I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

195
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,972
Uh, we're in seven-E.

196
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:27,815
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs Castevet.

197
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,215
She seemed so happy and full of...

198
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:34,356
She said wonderful things about you,
how grateful she was.

199
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,759
Thank you.

200
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,576
Know anything else
about this brother?

201
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,090
- No, I don't.
- It should be easy to find him.

202
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:45,795
- I'm so stunned. I'm so sorry.
- It's such a pity.

203
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,868
Well, thank you.

204
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:32,267
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything.

205
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,056
Don't tell me what Laura-Louise said.

206
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,650
If you' d listened
we wouldn't have had to do this!

207
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:50,515
We' d have been set to go now instead
of having to start from scratch!

208
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:53,274
I told you
not to tell her in advance!

209
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:56,273
I told you
she wouldn't be open-minded!

210
00:19:57,812 --> 00:20:00,690
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,

211
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,652
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.

212
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,991
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine. May I come in?

213
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:16,922
Of course. Please do.

214
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:20,391
I came to thank you
for saying those nice things.

215
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:25,574
Poor Terry. We thought we' d failed
her, though her note said we hadn't.

216
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:29,840
You'll never know how helpful
it was in such a shock moment.

217
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:33,483
So I do thank you. Roman does, too.
Roman's my hubby.

218
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:35,677
I'm glad I could help.

219
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:39,887
Well, she was cremated yesterday.
We got to forget and go on.

220
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:43,454
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children. You?

221
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,838
- No.
- Well, there you have it.

222
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:49,801
That's nice!
Look how you put the table!

223
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:51,936
Now, isn't that interesting?

224
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:55,948
- I saw it in a magazine.
- Oh, my. Nice paint job.

225
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,759
I know.

226
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,464
That's nice. What is that?
The TV room?

227
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:04,736
Only temporarily.
It's going to be a nursery.

228
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,951
- You're pregnant?
- Not yet.

229
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:09,562
I hope to be
as soon as we're settled.

230
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:12,268
You're young,
you ought to have lots.

231
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:16,175
- We plan to have three.
- I'm dying to see the apartment.

232
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:19,386
- The woman before was a friend.
- Terry said.

233
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:23,147
Did she? You had some long talks
in the laundry room.

234
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:25,782
- Only one.
- Oh! Oh, my goodness!

235
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:28,253
It looks so much brighter.

236
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:31,078
What do you pay for a chair
like that?

237
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:35,393
Uh, oh... Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.

238
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:40,014
- What does your hubby do?
- He's an actor.

239
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:45,315
I knew it! I said it to Roman
yesterday. He's so good-looking.

240
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:48,136
- What movies was he in?
- No movies.

241
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:53,646
Two plays called Luther and Nobody
Loves An Albatross, and a lot of TV.

242
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:58,515
Rosemary, I got a two-inch thick
sirloin steak defrosting now.

243
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,554
Why don't you and Guy
have supper with us?

244
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:04,151
- What do you say?
- Oh, we couldn't.

245
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:07,499
- Why not?
- No, really, that's very kind...

246
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:12,322
It would be a real help to us.
First night we'll be alone since...

247
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:15,757
Are you sure it wouldn't
be too much trouble?

248
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:18,737
Honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask.

249
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:22,142
All right, count on us.
I'll check with Guy.

250
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:25,118
You tell him
I won't take no for an answer!

251
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:28,955
- Here's your mail! Oh, ads.
- Thank you.

252
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,489
Donald Baumgart got that part.

253
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:12,784
It's a bad play.

254
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:17,391
Even if it folds out of town it's
the kind of part that gets noticed.

255
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:25,712
Mrs Castevet was here,

256
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:28,477
to thank me for what
I said about Terry.

257
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:31,953
She is the nosiest
person I've ever seen.

258
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,853
You know,
she asked the prices of things?

259
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,211
- No kidding.
- She invited us for dinner tonight.

260
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:43,791
I told her I' d have to check with
you, but it would probably be OK.

261
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,581
Jesus!
We don't have to, do we, honey?

262
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:48,530
I think they're lonely.

263
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:53,690
We get friendly with them
and we'll never get rid of them.

264
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:56,553
I told her she could count on us.

265
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:02,161
- You don't have to sulk about it.
- I'm not sulking.

266
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,294
I see exactly what you mean.

267
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,815
- Hell, we'll go.
- No, no. What for?

268
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:11,237
- We'll go!
- No. Not if you don't want to.

269
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:15,297
That sounds so phoney,
but I really mean it, really, I do.

270
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,819
Be my good deed for the day.

271
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,811
OK, but only if you want to.

272
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:27,097
And we'll make it clear that it's
just for this one night, all right?

273
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,150
Perfect timing! Come in.

274
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:33,470
Roman's fixing some vodka blushes.
I'm glad you could come, Guy.

275
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:37,049
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

276
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:40,434
Dinner isn't ready just yet
but sit down there.

277
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:42,652
You'll be very comfortable.

278
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,424
I seem to have
overfilled the glasses.

279
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,456
No, no, no. Don't get up.

280
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:50,824
Generally, I pour these precise,
don't l, Minnie?

281
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:53,959
- Watch the carpet.
- But I've made too much,

282
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,565
and rather... Oh, there we are.
No, no. Sit down.

283
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:59,918
- Mrs Woodhouse...
- Thank you.

284
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:03,247
- Mr Woodhouse, vodka blush?
- Yes, thanks.

285
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:06,272
- Have you ever tasted one?
- No, I haven't.

286
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:10,152
- It looks delicious.
- They're popular in Australia.

287
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:13,549
- Now, welcome to our home!
- Hear, hear.

288
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:14,970
Cheers.

289
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:21,859
- The carpet!
- Oh, dear.

290
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:26,705
Brand-new carpet.
This man is so clumsy!

291
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:28,988
Do you come from Australia?

292
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:31,963
Oh, no, I'm from
right here in New York.

293
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:35,399
I've been there, though.
I've been everywhere.

294
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,748
You name a place and I've been there.
Go ahead, name a place.

295
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,489
Fairbanks, Alaska!

296
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:44,195
I've been there, all over Alaska...

297
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:46,503
Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,

298
00:25:46,682 --> 00:25:48,320
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

299
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:51,274
- Went there in '38...
- Where are you from?

300
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:52,831
Well...

301
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,210
I'm from Omaha. Guy's from Baltimore.

302
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:57,673
They're good cities.

303
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,850
Do you travel for business?

304
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:04,578
Both. I'm 79, and I've been going
one place or another since I was 10.

305
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:07,140
I've been everywhere.

306
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:10,237
Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks.

307
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:12,331
Roman, take your pill!

308
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:16,730
No pope visits a city
where the newspapers are on strike.

309
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:20,277
I heard he's going to wait
till it's over.

310
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:22,256
That's showbiz.

311
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:27,099
That's exactly what it is. All the
costumes, rituals - all religions.

312
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:31,459
- We're offending Rosemary.
- No, no.

313
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:36,195
- Are you religious, my dear?
- I was brought up a Catholic.

314
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:40,392
- You looked uncomfortable.
- He is the Pope.

315
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:44,688
You don't have to respect him
because he pretends he's holy.

316
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:46,901
That's a good point.

317
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,632
What they spend on robes and jewels!

318
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:53,783
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organised religion

319
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:58,587
was given in Luther. Did you ever
get to play that leading part, Guy?

320
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,708
Weren't you
Albert Finney's understudy?

321
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,875
- No.
- Well, that's strange.

322
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:07,038
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made

323
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:09,452
and checking to see who you were.

324
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:14,344
- Um, what gesture was that?
- I'm not sure, it was a reaction...

325
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:18,552
Oh, I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

326
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,041
- It was a kind of involuntary reach.
- That's it!

327
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:25,627
- It had a wonderful authenticity.
- Oh, come on.

328
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:29,248
No, I mean it.
My father was a theatrical producer.

329
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:32,638
My early years
were spent in the company

330
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,857
of Mrs Fiske,
Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.

331
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:38,306
- Guy?
- Oh, yes, please.

332
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:43,205
You have an interesting inner
quality. It's in your TV work, too.

333
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:45,888
It should take you a long way,

334
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:49,282
provided that you get
those initial breaks.

335
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:51,894
Are you preparing for a show now?

336
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:54,241
Um, I'm up for a couple of parts.

337
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:58,625
- I can't believe you won't get them.
- I can.

338
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:01,642
I' d like to have
a spice garden some day.

339
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,683
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.

340
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:08,968
- You come from a big family?
- Three brothers and two sisters.

341
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:11,507
Your sisters married?

342
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:15,447
- They have children?
- One has two, the other has four.

343
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:19,405
- You'll have lots of children, too.
- We're fertile.

344
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:23,572
- I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
- Oh, my goodness!

345
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,132
Would you like me to wash
and you can wipe for a while?

346
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,448
Oh, no. That's fine, dear.

347
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,466
Roman, stop bending
Guy's ears with your stories.

348
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,158
He's only listening to be polite.

349
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,184
No, it's very interesting,
Mrs Castevet.

350
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,785
Minnie! I'm Minnie, he's Roman, OK?

351
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,028
OK! Terrific. Just terrific.

352
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,865
Goodbye, darling. Goodbye.
It was lovely, bless you.

353
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:05,108
- Minnie!
- Minnie, ya great kid, ya.

354
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,921
How about that steak?!

355
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,079
And the cake!
How did you eat two pieces?

356
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,805
Out of politeness.
That's how, out of politeness.

357
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:19,003
Only three dinner plates
that matched.

358
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:25,286
- And all that beautiful silver.
- Maybe they'll will it to us.

359
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:30,669
- Guess what's in their bathroom?
- A bidet.

360
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:32,929
- " Jokes For The John."
- No.

361
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:35,901
A book on a hook
right next to the toilet.

362
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:40,065
Roman's stories are pretty
damned interesting, though.

363
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:45,516
I'm going to go over there again
tomorrow night and hear some more.

364
00:29:45,822 --> 00:29:48,780
- You are?
- Yeah. He asked me. Do this for me.

365
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:52,144
I thought we were seeing
Joan and Dick Jellico.

366
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,804
- Was that definite?
- Not definite.

367
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:56,830
We'll see them next week.

368
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,356
You don't have to come along
if you don't want to.

369
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:04,705
- You can stay here.
- Yeah, I think I will stay here.

370
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:09,323
He knew Henry Irving, too. I mean,
really interesting, you know?

371
00:30:09,595 --> 00:30:12,189
Why did they take
their pictures down?

372
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,869
What do you mean?

373
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,450
Their pictures. They took them down.

374
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:18,953
Hooks in the wall and clean spaces.

375
00:30:19,146 --> 00:30:22,024
- The one picture there doesn't fit.
- I didn't notice.

376
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:04,765
Hi, dear. This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,

377
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:08,935
lives up on 12.
This is Guy's wife, Rosemary.

378
00:31:09,193 --> 00:31:10,911
Hello, Rosemary!

379
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,698
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
Could we come in?

380
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:18,463
- Uh, of course. Please do.
- There you are. Go ahead.

381
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,296
Look what they got. There's a light.

382
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:23,213
Oh, gosh!

383
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:26,967
- Isn't that beautiful!
- It came this morning.

384
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:30,519
- Are you all right, dear?
- Oh, I'm fine.

385
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,791
It's the first day of my period.

386
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:37,720
And you're up and around? On my
first day, I couldn't do anything!

387
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:41,242
Dan gave me gin through
a straw to kill the pain.

388
00:31:41,473 --> 00:31:44,545
Girls today take things
more in their stride.

389
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:48,124
They're healthier than us,
thanks to vitamins.

390
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:53,145
- What are those things, seat covers?
- Cushions for the window seats.

391
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:55,001
Oh, yeah.

392
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,458
Oh, before I forget,

393
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,613
- this is for you from Roman and me.
- For me?

394
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:09,344
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.

395
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:13,371
- There's no reason...
- It's real old, over 300 years.

396
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:22,610
It's lovely.

397
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:26,835
The green inside is tannis root.
That's for good luck.

398
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:29,852
It's lovely, but I...
I can't accept it.

399
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,700
You already have. Put it on.

400
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:38,963
You'll get used to the smell
before you know it.

401
00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:40,866
Yeah, go on.

402
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:45,310
Oh, yes.

403
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:49,162
Were his stories
as interesting as last night?

404
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:51,402
Yes. Did you have a good time?

405
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,014
All right. I got a present.

406
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:59,960
- It was Terry's.
- No kidding? Kind of pretty, though.

407
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:06,356
Aren't you going to wear it?

408
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:11,867
It smells. There's stuff in it called
tannis root from her greenhouse.

409
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:14,333
Not too bad, though.

410
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:24,369
Tannis, anyone?

411
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:27,725
Well, if you took it
you ought to wear it.

412
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,185
Hello? Yes, this is he.

413
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,889
Oh, God, no.

414
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:01,564
Oh, the poor guy.

415
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,799
And they don't have
any idea what's causing it?

416
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:10,224
Oh, my God, that's awful.
That's just awful.

417
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:15,690
Yes, I would. I mean, yes, I am.

418
00:34:17,578 --> 00:34:20,411
I hate to get it that way, but...

419
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:25,870
Well, you' d have to speak to my agent
about that end of it.

420
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,422
Alan Stone.

421
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:34,663
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
not as far as we're concerned.

422
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,721
Thank you, Mr Weiss.

423
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:42,161
Guy?

424
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:45,308
What is it?

425
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:52,205
Donald Baumgart... he's gone blind.

426
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:55,155
He woke up yesterday
and he can't see.

427
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:59,641
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I've got the part.

428
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,865
It's a hell of a way to get it.

429
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:10,897
Listen, uh...
I have to get out and walk around.

430
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:13,084
Yeah, I understand. Go ahead.

431
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:27,124
Baumgart. Donald Baumgart.

432
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:31,985
It's a fascinating part.
He'll be noticed.

433
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,978
He also has an offer for a lead
in a TV series, Miami Beach.

434
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,988
He's suddenly very hot.

435
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:41,463
Mm, now I understand
why you're so overjoyed.

436
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:46,295
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life. A challenge.

437
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,136
I see.

438
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:52,122
You know how actors are,
they're all a bit self-centred.

439
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:56,254
I'll bet even Laurence Olivier
is vain and self-centred.

440
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,658
It's a difficult part.

441
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:03,720
He's got to work with crutches,
and naturally he's preoccupied.

442
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,721
And he...

443
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:08,242
Well...preoccupied.

444
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:12,983
I see you had another suicide
up there at Happy House.

445
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,421
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.

446
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:20,642
It was the girl who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castevets.

447
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:22,733
I'm sure I told you that.

448
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:25,020
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully.

449
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,028
I've been a creep.

450
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:52,930
It's from worrying
if Baumgart would regain his sight.

451
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:56,060
Oh, you're bound to feel
two ways about it.

452
00:36:56,269 --> 00:37:00,023
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

453
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:02,627
- You haven't been.
- Yes, I have.

454
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:05,774
I've been tearing my
hair out over my career.

455
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:07,984
Let's have a baby. All right?

456
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:10,749
Let's have three babies,
one at a time.

457
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,340
A baby. You know,
Mama, Dada, poo-poo. You know?

458
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:16,613
- You mean it?
- Sure, I mean it.

459
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:20,018
I even figured out
the right time to start, look.

460
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:25,911
- You mean it, really?
- No, I'm kidding. Sure, I mean it.

461
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:29,642
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake,
don't cry.

462
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:31,919
Oh, no. I won't.

463
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:39,037
Here goes nothing.

464
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:54,195
- The paint! The paint!
- Good grief.

465
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,794
Nobody, but nobody
has a fire tonight.

466
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:16,826
Isn't it gorgeous? I hope
we have the coldest winter ever.

467
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:34,626
Oh, shit!

468
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,828
Hi, Guy! How are ya?

469
00:38:44,037 --> 00:38:46,392
No, don't let her in. Not tonight.

470
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,775
Oh, that's very kind of you.

471
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:54,903
Are you sure you won't come in?

472
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,803
No! I don't want to bother you.

473
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,661
Good. Good.

474
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:07,392
Who says there's nothing to ESP?

475
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:10,152
We shall have dessert after all!

476
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:14,665
Mousse au chocolat. Or as Minnie
calls it...chocolate mouse.

477
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,738
I was afraid she' d stay all evening.

478
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:19,854
She just wanted us to try it.

479
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:22,463
Her speciality.

480
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:26,443
It was sweet of her, really.
We shouldn't make fun of her.

481
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:28,976
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

482
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,674
It's good.

483
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:59,736
It has an undertaste.

484
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,897
A chalky undertaste.

485
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:06,219
I don't get it.

486
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,920
That's silly, there is no undertaste.

487
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,870
There is.

488
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,868
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.

489
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,469
- I don't like it.
- It's delicious.

490
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:21,546
- Here, you have mine.
- There's always something wrong.

491
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,548
If it's going to turn
into a big thing...

492
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,509
If you can't stand it, don't eat it.

493
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:32,393
It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.

494
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,353
Would you turn
the record over, please?

495
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,798
There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?

496
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,221
You get two of them.
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.

497
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,090
You were.

498
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:00,517
It's the Pope at Yankee Stadium!

499
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:04,334
Christ, what a mob!

500
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:09,417
Everywhere the Pope has been
he's received this type of reception.

501
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:11,910
As one man put it this afternoon,

502
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:16,847
"Perhaps we are being undignified,
but this is a special day."

503
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:21,051
That's a great spot
for my Yamaha commercial.

504
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:25,507
Here's a brief summary
of today's historic happenings.

505
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:28,604
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9.27am...

506
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:32,486
What is it?

507
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,095
Dizzy...

508
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:46,611
No wonder. All that booze.

509
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:51,076
You didn't eat anything
all day before dinner, huh?

510
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:24,285
Nice.

511
00:42:24,452 --> 00:42:27,603
Sleep is what you need.
A good night's sleep.

512
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,946
We have to make a baby.

513
00:42:30,124 --> 00:42:33,036
Oh, we'll...we'll do it.

514
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:37,847
- Tomorrow. There's plenty of time.
- Just a nap.

515
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,358
Why are you taking them off?

516
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:21,058
To make you more comfortable.

517
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:24,805
- I am more comfortable.
- Sleep, Ro.

518
00:44:04,504 --> 00:44:07,496
Isn't Hutch coming with us?

519
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:13,233
Catholics only, I...wish
we weren't bound by these prejudices,

520
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:15,510
but, unfortunately...

521
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:03,321
Easy, easy. You've got her too high.

522
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,358
Typhoon! Typhoon!

523
00:45:06,563 --> 00:45:09,077
It killed 55 people in London...!

524
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,458
You better go down below, miss.

525
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,940
- She's awake. She sees.
- She don't see.

526
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:30,218
As long as she ate the mouse,
she can't see nor hear. Now sing.

527
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:43,248
I'm sorry to hear
you aren't feeling well.

528
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,557
It's only the mouse bite.

529
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:50,290
You' d better have your legs tied down
in case of convulsions.

530
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:52,851
Yes, I suppose so.

531
00:46:54,496 --> 00:46:56,726
If it was rabid.

532
00:46:56,916 --> 00:47:00,989
If the music bothers you
let me know and I'll stop it.

533
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:05,644
Oh, no, no, no. Please don't
change the program on my account.

534
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:10,554
Try to sleep.
We'll be waiting up on deck.

535
00:47:48,047 --> 00:47:51,357
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

536
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:03,243
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.

537
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:06,835
Yes. That's why
I couldn't come to see you.

538
00:48:07,065 --> 00:48:11,502
That's all right. We wouldn't
want you to jeopardise your health.

539
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,731
Am I forgiven, Father?

540
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:17,055
Oh, absolutely.

541
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:31,820
Hey, it's after nine.

542
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:41,382
- Five minutes.
- I have to be at Alan's at 10.

543
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,200
- Eat out.
- Like hell I will.

544
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:59,236
- What time is it?
- It's ten after nine.

545
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,845
What time did I go to sleep?

546
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:06,265
You didn't go to sleep.
You passed out.

547
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:11,444
From now on you get cocktails
or wine, not cocktails and wine, hm?

548
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:14,140
The dreams I had.

549
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:21,705
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.

550
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,200
I didn't want to miss baby night.

551
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:29,098
- A couple of nails were ragged.
- While I was out?

552
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:32,149
It was fun,
in a necrophile sort of way.

553
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:37,723
I dreamed someone was...raping me.

554
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:41,776
- I don't know, someone inhuman.
- Thanks a lot!

555
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:48,266
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

556
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:51,166
I didn't want to miss the night.

557
00:49:51,372 --> 00:49:55,729
We could've done it this morning.
Last night wasn't the only time.

558
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,913
I was a little bit
loaded myself, you know?

559
00:50:19,523 --> 00:50:22,162
- Hello! Did ya like it?
- Oh, yes.

560
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:24,748
I put too much cream de cocoa in it.

561
00:50:24,944 --> 00:50:27,697
No, no.
You'll have to give me the recipe.

562
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:31,739
Yeah. You going shopping?
Do me a teeny favour, will ya?

563
00:50:31,993 --> 00:50:34,587
Get me six eggs,
a small instant Sanka.

564
00:50:34,787 --> 00:50:37,779
- Right. Bye-bye.
- Yeah. Ahh.

565
00:50:45,213 --> 00:50:47,568
We should talk about it.

566
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:50,511
- What?
- The way you haven't looked at me.

567
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:54,472
- What? I've been looking at you.
- You haven't.

568
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:58,874
Why, sure, I have.
Now, what is it? What's the matter?

569
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,192
Nothing. Never mind.

570
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:06,506
- No, no. Don't say that. What is it?
- Nothing.

571
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:10,897
Look, honey, I...I know I've been
preoccupied with the part,

572
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:15,272
but it is important.
That doesn't mean I don't love you.

573
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:30,877
It was due on Friday.

574
00:51:32,508 --> 00:51:34,738
- It was?
- Mm-hm.

575
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:37,805
It'll probably come
tonight or tomorrow.

576
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:39,844
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.

577
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:43,406
- A quarter. You're gonna lose.
- Shut up, will you?

578
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:47,191
You're getting me jumpy.
It's only been two days.

579
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:48,997
When will I know?

580
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,503
I'll call you when I get the results.

581
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,924
I like to do a general examination
just to know something more...

582
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,836
Elise Dunstan
recommended you, Doctor.

583
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,671
How is she?

584
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:05,217
- Fine. Did you deliver the boys?
- No, just the last.

585
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,250
- Universal haemoglobin.
- Yes, Doctor.

586
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,879
- We went to see The Fantasticks.
- Did you?

587
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:26,851
Did you enjoy it?

588
00:52:27,017 --> 00:52:28,814
- Yeah.
- Good.

589
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:37,133
- Hello?
- Mrs Woodhouse?

590
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:39,513
- Dr Hill?
- Congratulations.

591
00:52:39,697 --> 00:52:41,653
- Really?
- Really.

592
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:47,120
- Are you there?
- Yes, what happens now?

593
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:51,649
You come see me next month.
Get those pills. One a day.

594
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:56,228
- I'll mail you hospital forms.
- Uh, when will it be?

595
00:52:56,503 --> 00:53:00,462
- It works out to be June 28th.
- That sounds so far away.

596
00:53:00,715 --> 00:53:04,503
It is. One more thing,
we' d like another blood sample.

597
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:07,116
Oh, yes, of course. What for?

598
00:53:07,305 --> 00:53:11,742
The nurse didn't take enough,
so would you drop by and see her?

599
00:53:12,018 --> 00:53:14,088
But I am pregnant, aren't I?

600
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,945
Oh, yes, it's just
for blood samp... er, blood sugar.

601
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:22,024
- But you're pregnant.
- I'll come in on Monday.

602
00:53:22,278 --> 00:53:26,430
- Don't forget the pills.
- No, I won't. Goodbye, Dr Hill.

603
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:31,024
Blood sugar?

604
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:48,514
What's that?

605
00:53:51,305 --> 00:53:55,093
Oh! That's great! That's just great.

606
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,341
- Father.
- Mother.

607
00:53:59,645 --> 00:54:01,601
Guy, Guy, listen.

608
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:04,526
Let's, uh, make this
a new beginning, OK?

609
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:08,806
A new openness with each other,
because we haven't been open.

610
00:54:09,072 --> 00:54:13,190
That's true. I've been
so self-centred. That's the trouble.

611
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,408
You know I love you, don't you, Ro?

612
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:19,055
I swear to God,
I'll be as open and...

613
00:54:19,248 --> 00:54:21,762
- It's my fault too.
- Bull, it's mine.

614
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:24,553
Bear with me.
I'll do better, you hear?

615
00:54:24,753 --> 00:54:26,232
Oh, Guy.

616
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:37,579
- What?
- It's...

617
00:54:37,765 --> 00:54:40,837
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.

618
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,778
Hey...

619
00:54:42,937 --> 00:54:45,451
- Know what I' d love to do?
- What?

620
00:54:46,357 --> 00:54:50,475
Tell Minnie and Roman.
Oh, I know, I know. It's...

621
00:54:50,735 --> 00:54:53,727
It's supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,

622
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:56,666
but I already told them
we were trying.

623
00:54:56,866 --> 00:55:00,984
- They were so pleased.
- Tell them.

624
00:55:01,245 --> 00:55:03,634
Back in two minutes?

625
00:55:14,716 --> 00:55:16,468
You're pregnant.

626
00:55:17,636 --> 00:55:19,513
Another blood sample.

627
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:24,939
Now, that's what I call good news.

628
00:55:25,184 --> 00:55:28,813
- Oh, honey, congratulations.
- Thank you.

629
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:31,783
- Best wishes, Rosemary.
- Thank you.

630
00:55:31,982 --> 00:55:34,371
We're more pleased than we can say.

631
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:37,641
We didn't have any champagne
but this will do.

632
00:55:37,863 --> 00:55:40,058
- When are you due?
- June 28th.

633
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,152
It'll be so ex citing.
You got a good doctor?

634
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:45,120
Oh, yes, very good.

635
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:50,361
One of the top obstetricians is a
dear friend of ours, Abe Sapirstein.

636
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,897
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.

637
00:55:54,129 --> 00:55:56,882
- Wasn't he on Open End?
- That's right.

638
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,924
- Ro?
- Well, what about Dr Hill?

639
00:56:01,176 --> 00:56:04,486
Don't worry, I'll tell him something.
You know me.

640
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:08,191
I won't let you go to
no Dr Hill nobody ever heard of.

641
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:12,222
The best is what you'll have!
Where's your telephone?

642
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:15,118
- The bedroom.
- He's a brilliant man.

643
00:56:15,315 --> 00:56:18,193
- Very sensitive.
- Ro, sit down, sit down.

644
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,914
- No, I'm fine.
- Abe? Minnie.

645
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:25,230
Listen, a dear friend of ours
just found out she's pregnant.

646
00:56:25,492 --> 00:56:27,926
Yeah, I'm in her apartment right now.

647
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:30,075
We said you' d take care of her,

648
00:56:30,246 --> 00:56:33,636
you wouldn't charge
your society prices neither.

649
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:37,264
Just a minute.
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11?

650
00:56:37,503 --> 00:56:41,052
- All right.
- Yeah, 11's fine, Abe.

651
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:45,370
Uh-huh. Yeah, well, you, too.
No, no, no, no, not at all.

652
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:48,307
All right. Well, let's hope so.
Goodbye.

653
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:52,506
- Well, there you are.
- Thanks a million, Minnie.

654
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:57,079
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Just have a fine, healthy baby.

655
00:56:57,355 --> 00:57:00,188
My,
I can't wait to tell Laura-Louise.

656
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,154
Oh. Uh, please don't
tell anyone else, not right away.

657
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:07,439
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.

658
00:57:07,655 --> 00:57:11,330
- Now, to a fine, healthy baby.
- Hear, hear!

659
00:57:14,328 --> 00:57:18,958
Andy. Or Susan.

660
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:23,322
Susan.

661
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:10,719
Please don't read books.

662
00:58:10,882 --> 00:58:14,431
No pregnancy was ever
exactly like the ones in books.

663
00:58:14,677 --> 00:58:17,510
And don't listen
to your friends, either.

664
00:58:17,722 --> 00:58:20,520
No two pregnancies are ever alike.

665
00:58:20,724 --> 00:58:24,273
- Dr Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
- No pills.

666
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:26,987
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.

667
00:58:27,189 --> 00:58:29,339
I'll have her make a daily drink

668
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:34,041
that'll be fresher, safer
and more vitamin-rich than any pills.

669
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,834
Any questions,
call me, night or day.

670
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:41,422
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.

671
00:58:41,703 --> 00:58:43,534
- Here.
- What's in it?

672
00:58:43,704 --> 00:58:46,377
Snips and snails
and puppy dogs' tails.

673
00:58:46,582 --> 00:58:49,858
- But what if we want a girl?
- Do you?

674
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:52,918
It would be nice
if the first one were a boy.

675
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,882
Well, there you are.

676
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:59,428
No, really, what is in it?

677
00:58:59,594 --> 00:59:03,030
- A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.
- Tannis root?

678
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:05,859
Some of that
along with some other things.

679
00:59:08,686 --> 00:59:11,598
If you want to be stupid
be non-violent stupid,

680
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:15,363
I'm in love with no one,
especially not your fat wife.

681
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:17,679
I'm a hopeless cripple...

682
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:21,630
What's that?

683
00:59:22,741 --> 00:59:25,096
I've been to Vidal Sassoon.

684
00:59:25,285 --> 00:59:27,674
Don't tell me you paid for that?

685
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:31,720
Guy, I have a pain.

686
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:34,145
- Where?
- Here.

687
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:36,849
- Just now?
- Since Monday.

688
00:59:37,047 --> 00:59:39,800
- A sharp pain.
- Did you see Sapirstein?

689
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:41,839
I'm seeing him Wednesday.

690
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:44,682
This is ridiculous.
Go see Sapirstein.

691
00:59:44,886 --> 00:59:48,401
- Why didn't you say?
- I see him Wednesday regular.

692
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,838
A natural expansion of the pelvis.
Take some ordinary aspirin.

693
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:56,175
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.

694
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:59,355
I thought you weren't
going to read books?

695
00:59:59,568 --> 01:00:02,765
- It was in the drugstore.
- It just worried you.

696
01:00:02,987 --> 01:00:07,105
Throw it away, please?
The pains will be gone in two days.

697
01:00:08,284 --> 01:00:10,002
Ectopic pregnancy!

698
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:55,620
I look awful.

699
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:59,096
What are you talking about?
You look great.

700
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:02,050
It's that haircut that looks awful.

701
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:06,688
You want the truth, honey, that's
the worst mistake you ever made.

702
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:45,540
- My God!
- It's Vidal Sassoon. It's very in.

703
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:48,864
- What's wrong with you?
- Do I look that bad?

704
01:01:49,086 --> 01:01:52,522
Terrible! You're not on
one of those Zen diets?

705
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:54,713
- No.
- Then what is it?

706
01:01:54,884 --> 01:01:56,522
Have you seen a doctor?

707
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:59,270
I might as well tell you.
I'm pregnant.

708
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:03,385
Rubbish. Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.

709
01:02:03,642 --> 01:02:08,796
I don't sleep well. I have stiff
joints or something, so I get a pain.

710
01:02:09,106 --> 01:02:12,337
- Nothing serious.
- Well, congratulations.

711
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:16,479
- You must be very happy.
- Oh, I am. We both are.

712
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:20,128
- Who 's your obstetrician?
- Abraham Sapirstein.

713
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:23,437
Oh! He delivered
two of my daughter's babies.

714
01:02:23,661 --> 01:02:26,937
- He's one of the best.
- When did you see him last?

715
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:29,200
- Um, yesterday.
- And?

716
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,444
And he says it's fairly common.

717
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:36,985
- How much weight have you lost?
- Three pounds.

718
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:39,733
You've lost far more than that.

719
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:43,156
It's perfectly normal
to lose a little at first.

720
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:45,298
Later on, I'll be gaining.

721
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:49,671
Well...we must assume Dr Sapirstein
knows whereof he speaks.

722
01:02:49,935 --> 01:02:51,891
He should. He charges enough.

723
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:55,692
We get bargain rates.
Our neighbours are his friends.

724
01:02:55,941 --> 01:02:57,613
I'll go.

725
01:02:57,776 --> 01:03:01,405
Stay where you are.
It hurts less when I move around.

726
01:03:03,073 --> 01:03:06,588
- I was just talking about you.
- Favourably, I hope.

727
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:10,137
- Do you need anything?
- No. Thank you for asking.

728
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:13,647
- Is Guy home already?
- He won't be home till six.

729
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,748
A friend of ours is here.

730
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,591
Would you...would you
like to meet him?

731
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:22,869
- If I won't be intruding?
- No. Please come in.

732
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:37,980
Hutch, this is Roman Castevet.
Edward Hutchins.

733
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,791
- How do you do?
- Oh, how are you, sir?

734
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:44,134
I was just saying,
you sent me to Dr Sapirstein.

735
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,717
- Rosemary told you the news?
- Yes.

736
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:51,103
- She must get plenty of rest.
- I was alarmed by her appearance.

737
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:54,645
She has lost some weight,
but that's quite normal.

738
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,544
Later she'll gain, probably too much.

739
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,980
- So I gather.
- Please sit down.

740
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:04,365
Mrs Castevet makes a vitamin drink
for me from herbs she grows.

741
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:07,987
All according
to Dr Sapirstein's directions.

742
01:04:08,217 --> 01:04:12,176
He's suspicious of commercially
prepared vitamin pills.

743
01:04:12,429 --> 01:04:16,627
But they're manufactured
under every imaginable safeguard.

744
01:04:16,892 --> 01:04:20,601
True, but pills can sit
for months on a druggist's shelf

745
01:04:20,854 --> 01:04:24,927
- and lose their original potency.
- I hadn't thought of that.

746
01:04:25,191 --> 01:04:27,466
I like having everything natural.

747
01:04:27,652 --> 01:04:32,726
I'll bet expectant mothers chewed
tannis root before vitamin pills.

748
01:04:33,032 --> 01:04:36,342
- Tannis root?
- It's one of the herbs in the drink.

749
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:38,773
Is it an herb? Can a root be an herb?

750
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:42,504
- You don't mean anise or orrisroot?
- No, tannis.

751
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:45,661
Look.

752
01:04:47,588 --> 01:04:49,544
It's good luck, too.

753
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,150
Doesn't look like root matter,

754
01:04:57,388 --> 01:05:00,141
more like mould
or fungus of some kind.

755
01:05:01,058 --> 01:05:05,688
- Is it ever called any other name?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

756
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,575
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopaedia.

757
01:05:09,817 --> 01:05:13,856
- What a pretty holder or charm.
- The Castevets gave it to me.

758
01:05:14,112 --> 01:05:18,549
You seem to be taking better care
of Rosemary than her own parents.

759
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:22,943
We're very fond of her. And Guy.
Now ex cuse me, I'll have to go.

760
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:26,356
- My wife is waiting.
- It's nice to have met you.

761
01:05:26,582 --> 01:05:30,575
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

762
01:05:33,256 --> 01:05:35,611
I just noticed he has pierced ears.

763
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:39,997
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
What's she like?

764
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,260
Nosy. Funny.

765
01:05:43,431 --> 01:05:45,547
Guy's gotten very close to them.

766
01:05:45,725 --> 01:05:49,513
I suppose they've become
sort of parent figures for him.

767
01:05:50,856 --> 01:05:54,371
- And you?
- I...I don't know.

768
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:58,488
Sometimes they're too friendly.

769
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:02,525
Hey, what a surprise.
How are you, Hutch? Good to see you.

770
01:06:02,783 --> 01:06:06,742
- You're the surprise. What happened?
- They had a rewrite.

771
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:11,194
- Stay where you are. Nobody move.
- Would you like some coffee?

772
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,016
Love some!

773
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:20,906
- Loot!
- Congratulations are in order.

774
01:06:21,134 --> 01:06:24,126
- Wonderful, isn't it?
- When's the baby due?

775
01:06:24,345 --> 01:06:28,657
June 28th. Dr Sapirstein delivered
two of Hutch's grandchildren.

776
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:30,685
- Really?
- Mm.

777
01:06:30,852 --> 01:06:33,366
I met your neighbour. Roman Castevet.

778
01:06:33,562 --> 01:06:36,156
Oh, did you?
Funny old duck, isn't he?

779
01:06:36,357 --> 01:06:39,030
- He has pierced ears.
- You're kidding?

780
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:40,667
No, I saw.

781
01:06:40,819 --> 01:06:44,858
We haven't seen you lately,
but I'm so busy and Ro 's pregnant

782
01:06:45,115 --> 01:06:46,867
so we haven't seen anyone.

783
01:06:47,033 --> 01:06:50,025
- Let's have dinner soon.
- You're not going?

784
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:53,237
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Thanks for coming.

785
01:06:57,459 --> 01:06:59,973
This isn't mine. It must be yours.

786
01:07:00,171 --> 01:07:03,800
Right. Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?

787
01:07:04,049 --> 01:07:07,758
Andrew or Douglas for a boy,
Melinda or Sarah for a girl.

788
01:07:08,012 --> 01:07:10,651
- Sarah?
- Is there another of these?

789
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:19,686
- I don't see it, Hutch.
- No, it's not here.

790
01:07:19,897 --> 01:07:23,856
I probably left it at the
City Centre. I'll stop back there.

791
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:27,420
- Let's have that dinner, shall we?
- Next week.

792
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:29,326
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

793
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:31,048
- Bye.
- Bye.

794
01:07:37,831 --> 01:07:42,029
- That was a nice surprise.
- Guess what he said.

795
01:07:43,294 --> 01:07:45,524
- What?
- I look terrible.

796
01:07:45,713 --> 01:07:49,262
Good old Hutch.
Spreading cheer wherever he goes.

797
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:52,180
I'm going to get a paper, honey.

798
01:07:52,387 --> 01:07:56,096
- He's a professional crepehanger.
- He's not.

799
01:07:56,348 --> 01:07:58,543
Then he's a top-ranking amateur.

800
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:14,524
Hello. She's not feeling too well.

801
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:18,050
I think she's asleep.

802
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:19,723
All right.

803
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:22,429
Oh, she could be, yeah.

804
01:08:22,623 --> 01:08:24,932
All right, can you hold on a minute?

805
01:08:27,794 --> 01:08:30,149
It's Hutch. He wants to speak to you.

806
01:08:31,756 --> 01:08:35,465
I told him you were resting
but he said it couldn't wait.

807
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:46,039
- Hutch?
- Dear, do you go out at all?

808
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:49,023
Well, I...I haven't
been going out, why?

809
01:08:49,231 --> 01:08:53,986
Can you meet me tomorrow morning
in front of the Time-Life Building?

810
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:57,634
If you want me to.
What is it? Can't you tell me now?

811
01:08:57,864 --> 01:09:00,856
I' d rather not.
We can have an early lunch.

812
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:03,953
- That would be nice.
- Good. 11 o ' clock?

813
01:09:04,162 --> 01:09:06,517
OK. Oh, did you find your glove?

814
01:09:06,705 --> 01:09:09,458
No.
Good night, Rosemary. Sleep well.

815
01:09:09,668 --> 01:09:11,226
You, too. Good night.

816
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:14,449
- What was that?
- He wants to talk to me.

817
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:17,664
- What about?
- I don't know. He wouldn't say.

818
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:21,478
Those boys' adventure stories
are going to his head.

819
01:09:24,013 --> 01:09:25,810
Where are you meeting him?

820
01:09:25,974 --> 01:09:29,523
Uh, Time and Life Building
tomorrow at 11 o ' clock.

821
01:09:32,355 --> 01:09:34,710
You're pregnant, I've got the yens.

822
01:09:34,898 --> 01:09:38,607
- I'm getting an ice-cream. Want one?
- I' d love one.

823
01:09:38,862 --> 01:09:40,853
- Vanilla?
- OK.

824
01:10:04,343 --> 01:10:07,938
- Hi.
- I won't have my drink now.

825
01:10:08,181 --> 01:10:12,015
Fine, dear. Take it later.
Buzz me when you get back, huh?

826
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:42,435
Pain, begone.
I will have no more of thee.

827
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:21,079
- Yes?
- Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?

828
01:11:21,332 --> 01:11:24,881
- Yes. Who is this?
- My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

829
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:28,517
I had an appointment
with Mr Hutchins. Is he there?

830
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:32,271
- Hello?
- He was taken ill this morning.

831
01:11:32,509 --> 01:11:34,465
- Taken ill?
- Yes.

832
01:11:34,636 --> 01:11:37,514
He's in a coma
at St Vincent's Hospital.

833
01:11:37,722 --> 01:11:43,513
That's awful. I just spoke
to him last night about 10.30.

834
01:11:43,854 --> 01:11:46,607
- I spoke to him at 11.
- Who is this?

835
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:50,603
You don't know me.
I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend.

836
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,819
- Do they know what's causing it?
- No, they don't know yet.

837
01:11:55,072 --> 01:12:00,100
He's totally unresponsive.
Oh, I'm going to the hospital now.

838
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:03,322
- Is there anything I can do?
- Not really.

839
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:06,586
All right, thank you.

840
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,477
No! This is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!

841
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:44,407
I said to myself,
if Rosemary's going out,

842
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:47,656
I might as well
do some Christmas shopping.

843
01:12:47,872 --> 01:12:51,308
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?

844
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:56,013
Aw, darling, what's the matter?
You feel all right?

845
01:12:57,423 --> 01:12:59,379
You poor thing.

846
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:04,020
You know what? I think we better
be going home now. What do you say?

847
01:13:04,304 --> 01:13:08,502
- No, you have your shopping to do.
- Ah, there's two more weeks.

848
01:13:26,075 --> 01:13:27,793
It'll stop any day now.

849
01:13:27,951 --> 01:13:31,023
It's like a wire
inside me tightening.

850
01:13:31,246 --> 01:13:35,717
Usually older women with less
flexible joints have this trouble.

851
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,673
- I'm not going out.
- You don't have to.

852
01:13:38,878 --> 01:13:40,834
One minute to go!

853
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:46,617
Rosemary, meet Dr Shand.
He used to be a famous dentist.

854
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:50,514
- He made the chain for your charm.
- Oh, how do you do?

855
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:53,722
Come on, sweetie.
Put this wonderful hat on.

856
01:13:53,933 --> 01:13:55,889
Doctor, come over here.

857
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:58,859
- Minnie, Minnie!
- Happy New Year.

858
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:02,022
- Have a good year.
- Happy New Year.

859
01:14:04,152 --> 01:14:06,666
To 1966!

860
01:14:06,863 --> 01:14:09,741
The year one!

861
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,686
What the hell are you doing?

862
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:08,153
Planning the menu. We're having
a party a week from Saturday.

863
01:15:09,462 --> 01:15:12,534
It's for our old...
I mean, our young friends.

864
01:15:12,757 --> 01:15:16,750
Minnie and Roman are not invited.
Neither is Laura-Louise.

865
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:18,569
Nor is Dr Sapirstein.

866
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:22,601
It's a very special party.
You have to be under 60 to get in.

867
01:15:28,731 --> 01:15:33,088
Well...for a minute there, I didn't
think I was going to make it.

868
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,193
You'll make it.
You can be bartender.

869
01:15:36,405 --> 01:15:40,637
Oh, swell. Do you really think
it's such a good idea?

870
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:43,468
It's the best idea
I've had in months.

871
01:15:43,662 --> 01:15:46,495
Shouldn't you check
with Dr Sapirstein?

872
01:15:46,706 --> 01:15:50,335
I'm giving a party,
not swimming the English Channel.

873
01:15:50,586 --> 01:15:52,577
What about the pain?

874
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:57,384
Oh, haven't you heard?
lt'll go away in a day or two.

875
01:15:57,633 --> 01:16:00,022
That looks interesting.

876
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,336
We're having some people over.

877
01:16:02,513 --> 01:16:04,583
You feel up to entertaining?

878
01:16:04,766 --> 01:16:08,122
Yes. These are old friends
that I haven't seen in a long time.

879
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:12,185
- They don't even know I'm pregnant.
- I'll give you a hand if you like.

880
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:15,111
No, thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.

881
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:18,468
It's a buffet,
and we'll get a bartender, so...

882
01:16:18,694 --> 01:16:20,446
I'll help take the coats.

883
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:23,605
No, really, you do too much
for me as it is.

884
01:16:23,825 --> 01:16:26,817
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

885
01:16:27,035 --> 01:16:28,787
Drink your drink, hon.

886
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:33,084
I' d rather not.
Not right this minute.

887
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,327
I'll drink it in a little while.

888
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,334
- It don't do to let it stand.
- No, I won't.

889
01:16:38,546 --> 01:16:41,618
You go back,
I'll bring the glass back later.

890
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:43,718
I'll wait. Save you the walk.

891
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:48,277
No, it makes me very nervous when
people watch me cook. Now, scoot.

892
01:16:48,556 --> 01:16:52,071
Don't let it stand too long,
it'll lose its vitamins.

893
01:17:02,778 --> 01:17:06,566
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!

894
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:09,178
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

895
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:11,323
- Hey, Rosie.
- Yeah?

896
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:15,726
Bob and Leo got stuck at
another party but they'll be over.

897
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:17,909
Fine.

898
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,517
Oh, Rosie, it's a fantastic house!

899
01:17:22,296 --> 01:17:23,854
Hi.

900
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:28,080
- It's been so long.
- You look like a piece of chalk.

901
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,574
You make him feed you, love.

902
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:38,145
- Adrian Marcato lived here.
- And the Trench sisters.

903
01:17:38,394 --> 01:17:39,873
They ate children.

904
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:43,809
He doesn't just mean they ate them.
He means they ate them.

905
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:52,916
I make their first one strong
to get them happy, eh?

906
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:57,071
Rosie, do you feel OK?
You look tired.

907
01:17:57,328 --> 01:17:59,603
Thanks for the understatement.

908
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:04,704
How do you like CC Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?

909
01:18:06,004 --> 01:18:07,756
I'm not going to him.

910
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:09,401
You're not?

911
01:18:09,549 --> 01:18:12,700
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein.

912
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:16,556
- Oh, congratulations, Papa.
- Thanks. Nothing to it.

913
01:18:16,806 --> 01:18:21,004
- I'll take that dip inside.
- Oh, yeah, please. See my flowers?

914
01:18:21,268 --> 01:18:24,578
Yeah. Elise, will you give me a hand?

915
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,326
Oh, yeah, sure.

916
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:34,000
Is the other guy still blind?

917
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:38,553
Donald Baumgart? You know who he is.
The boy Zoe Piper lives with.

918
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:41,579
- He's writing a play.
- Is he still blind?

919
01:18:41,788 --> 01:18:45,098
Yeah. He's going through hell
trying to adjust.

920
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,244
He dictates and Zoe writes.

921
01:18:54,841 --> 01:18:56,911
Are you all right?

922
01:18:58,845 --> 01:19:02,155
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a cramp for a minute.

923
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:04,984
- Don't cry.
- It's good for her.

924
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:09,654
Let her cry it out. It's all right,
darling. Sit down, sit down.

925
01:19:14,317 --> 01:19:16,069
- Out, out!
- Let me in.

926
01:19:16,236 --> 01:19:18,670
- Girls only.
- I want to see Rosemary.

927
01:19:18,864 --> 01:19:21,253
- She's busy.
- I have to wash these...

928
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,008
Use the bathroom.

929
01:19:26,663 --> 01:19:30,417
It hurts so much.
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.

930
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:33,101
When did the pain start?

931
01:19:33,294 --> 01:19:36,491
In November.

932
01:19:36,713 --> 01:19:39,227
- November?!
- What?

933
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:43,418
You have been in pain since November,
and he's not helping?

934
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,510
He says it's gonna stop.

935
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:49,434
- Why don't you see another doctor?
- No, he's very good.

936
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,119
He was on Open End.

937
01:19:52,312 --> 01:19:54,542
He sounds like a sadistic nut.

938
01:19:54,731 --> 01:19:59,964
Rosemary, pain like that is a
warning that something isn't right.

939
01:20:00,278 --> 01:20:04,237
Go see Dr Hill.
Go see anybody besides that...that...

940
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:07,607
- That nut.
- Don't go on suffering like this.

941
01:20:07,827 --> 01:20:09,783
I won't have an abortion.

942
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:12,911
Nobody's telling you to.
Just see another doctor.

943
01:20:22,298 --> 01:20:25,449
The thing to do now is move.

944
01:20:25,676 --> 01:20:28,110
- Guy?
- Yeah?

945
01:20:28,304 --> 01:20:31,057
I'm going to Dr Hill Monday morning.

946
01:20:32,599 --> 01:20:35,432
Dr Sapirstein
is either lying, or he's...

947
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:37,521
I don't know, out of his mind.

948
01:20:37,687 --> 01:20:40,838
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.

949
01:20:41,066 --> 01:20:44,456
- Rosemary...
- I'm not drinking Minnie's drink.

950
01:20:44,694 --> 01:20:47,811
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.

951
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:52,024
I haven't drunk it for three days.
I've thrown it away.

952
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:55,083
- You've what?
- I've made my own drink.

953
01:20:55,287 --> 01:20:59,041
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

954
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:03,204
- And is that their hint for today?
- They're my friends...

955
01:21:03,462 --> 01:21:08,013
They're not very bright bitches
who should mind their own business!

956
01:21:08,299 --> 01:21:10,449
They said get a second opinion.

957
01:21:10,635 --> 01:21:14,548
Rosemary, you know who Dr Hill is?
He's a Charlie nobody.

958
01:21:14,806 --> 01:21:16,444
That's who he is!

959
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,876
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr Sapirstein is.

960
01:21:20,103 --> 01:21:24,938
We'll have to pay Sapirstein,
pay Hill. It's out of the question.

961
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:29,021
No, I'm not changing.
I just wanna get a second opinion.

962
01:21:29,278 --> 01:21:31,109
I won't let you do it, Ro.

963
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,432
I mean, because it's, uh...
it's not fair to Sapirstein.

964
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,089
Not fair to...?

965
01:21:38,286 --> 01:21:42,438
What are you talking about?
What about what's fair to me?

966
01:21:42,706 --> 01:21:44,458
You want a second opinion?

967
01:21:44,626 --> 01:21:48,335
You tell Sapirstein
and let him decide who gives it.

968
01:21:48,587 --> 01:21:50,145
No! I want Dr Hill!

969
01:21:50,298 --> 01:21:54,576
- At least have that much courtesy...
- If you won't pay, I'll...

970
01:21:58,305 --> 01:22:00,136
Ro?

971
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:05,221
- Rosemary? What is it?
- It stopped.

972
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:11,042
- What?
- The pain stopped just like that.

973
01:22:11,317 --> 01:22:13,194
- Stopped?
- Stopped.

974
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:18,119
What was in that drink you made?

975
01:22:21,578 --> 01:22:26,732
- Uh...eggs, milk, sug...sugar.
- What else?

976
01:22:30,627 --> 01:22:32,299
What else?

977
01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:37,013
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake,
what else was in that drink?

978
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:41,009
It's alive! Guy, it's moving!

979
01:22:41,263 --> 01:22:43,493
It's alive! It's all right!

980
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,036
- Feel. Feel.
- Oh, yeah, I felt it.

981
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:52,023
- Don't be scared. It won't bite you.
- It's wonderful. It really is.

982
01:22:52,313 --> 01:22:55,464
I feel it kicking. It's alive!

983
01:22:55,692 --> 01:22:57,569
It's moving!

984
01:23:01,698 --> 01:23:04,531
I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess.

985
01:23:21,716 --> 01:23:23,274
Watch the walls.

986
01:23:31,893 --> 01:23:35,772
- Thanks, boys. Have one on the baby.
- Thank you very much.

987
01:24:04,716 --> 01:24:06,388
What's that for?

988
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:09,701
- This is my hospital suitcase.
- Honey, you got three weeks.

989
01:24:17,269 --> 01:24:20,147
Yes? Hello, Mrs Cardiff.

990
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,043
No.

991
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:26,709
Oh, my God.

992
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,527
Oh, my God.

993
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:32,576
Yes, of course I will.

994
01:24:44,711 --> 01:24:46,588
Hutch is dead.

995
01:24:51,301 --> 01:24:55,499
I feel awful. All this time,
I didn't even think of him.

996
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:18,933
Doctor. Doris, we'll see you later.

997
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:23,407
I beg your pardon. I'm Mrs Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

998
01:25:23,664 --> 01:25:26,019
- You're Rosemary?
- I'm so sorry.

999
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:29,246
- Thank you. This is my sister.
- How do you do?

1000
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:31,578
- And my husband.
- How do you do?

1001
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:33,826
- Sorry to be late.
- Ex cuse me.

1002
01:25:34,008 --> 01:25:35,919
- Yes?
- I'm Grace Cardiff.

1003
01:25:36,093 --> 01:25:37,651
I was hoping to meet you.

1004
01:25:37,803 --> 01:25:40,920
I was going to mail this,
but I thought you' d be here.

1005
01:25:41,139 --> 01:25:43,095
- What is it?
- A book.

1006
01:25:43,267 --> 01:25:47,783
Hutch regained consciousness
and thought it was the next morning.

1007
01:25:48,062 --> 01:25:50,622
- You had the appointment?
- Oh, yes.

1008
01:25:50,814 --> 01:25:54,966
I wasn't there, but he told the
doctor to make sure you got the book.

1009
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:56,987
Thank you.

1010
01:25:57,154 --> 01:26:00,510
Oh, and I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.

1011
01:26:00,741 --> 01:26:03,494
- The name of the book?
- Apparently.

1012
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:06,852
He was delirious,
so it's hard to be sure.

1013
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,520
I heard you come in.
It wasn't very long.

1014
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:36,563
I was late. I couldn't get a taxi.

1015
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:40,089
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, you got mail already?

1016
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,117
Somebody gave it to me.

1017
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,192
Here. I'll hold it. Book?

1018
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:50,247
I know that house!
The Gilmores used to live there.

1019
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:52,248
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1020
01:26:52,414 --> 01:26:56,805
I've been there lots of times.
Grace...that's my favourite name.

1021
01:26:57,085 --> 01:26:59,041
- Yes.
- You need anything?

1022
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:01,168
- No, thank you.
- Take a nap.

1023
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,251
- I'm going to.
- Goodbye.

1024
01:27:44,714 --> 01:27:46,705
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

1025
01:27:46,882 --> 01:27:49,476
"he was soon after
brought to New York.

1026
01:27:49,677 --> 01:27:52,987
"He resided for several years
in the United St...

1027
01:27:53,221 --> 01:27:57,055
"He was attacked by a mob
outside the Bram..."

1028
01:27:57,309 --> 01:27:59,584
Outside, not in the lobby.

1029
01:28:09,695 --> 01:28:12,573
There are no witches. Not really.

1030
01:28:15,701 --> 01:28:17,612
The name is an anagram.

1031
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:42,601
Now, that really makes sense.

1032
01:29:44,702 --> 01:29:46,215
Poor Hutch.

1033
01:30:48,303 --> 01:30:50,055
What's with the chain?

1034
01:30:52,724 --> 01:30:54,362
What's the matter?

1035
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:58,153
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1036
01:30:58,354 --> 01:30:59,582
Oh.

1037
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,927
- Oh, thank you.
- How was the funeral?

1038
01:31:03,151 --> 01:31:04,743
OK.

1039
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:08,132
I got the shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

1040
01:31:11,658 --> 01:31:14,491
I got that shirt that
was in the New Yorker.

1041
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:18,058
That's nice.
Do you know who Roman really is?

1042
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:21,123
- What do you mean?
- Adrian Marcato 's son.

1043
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:23,529
- What?
- Come here.

1044
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:26,509
I want to show you something.

1045
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:30,706
Roman Castevet
is Steven Marcato rearranged.

1046
01:31:32,344 --> 01:31:33,902
It's from Hutch.

1047
01:31:40,144 --> 01:31:41,497
Look.

1048
01:31:42,728 --> 01:31:46,801
And look here. There he is
when he was 13. See the eyes?

1049
01:31:50,194 --> 01:31:52,549
- Coincidence.
- In the same house?

1050
01:31:52,738 --> 01:31:54,376
And look. Look here.

1051
01:31:54,531 --> 01:31:58,490
"Soon after that in August, 1886,
his son Steven was born."

1052
01:31:58,743 --> 01:32:03,453
1886, got it? That makes him 79 now.
No coincidence.

1053
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:14,024
No, I guess not. He's Steven Marcato,
all right. Poor old geezer.

1054
01:32:14,342 --> 01:32:18,938
With a crazy father like that, no
wonder he switched his name around.

1055
01:32:19,221 --> 01:32:23,100
- You don't think he's the same?
- What do you mean, a witch?

1056
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:26,148
Ro, are you kidding? Oh, Ro, honey.

1057
01:32:27,354 --> 01:32:31,063
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?

1058
01:32:31,316 --> 01:32:33,147
Honey, it's 1966.

1059
01:32:33,319 --> 01:32:37,278
This was published in 1933.
There were covens in Europe.

1060
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:39,521
That's their name, the congregation.

1061
01:32:39,699 --> 01:32:43,738
Covens in Europe, America,
Australia and one right here.

1062
01:32:43,995 --> 01:32:48,068
The parties with the singing
and the flute and the chanting,

1063
01:32:48,332 --> 01:32:51,165
- those are Sabbaths.
- Don't get ex cited.

1064
01:32:51,376 --> 01:32:54,766
Read what they do.
They use blood in their rituals.

1065
01:32:55,005 --> 01:32:57,599
And the most powerful
is baby's blood.

1066
01:32:57,799 --> 01:33:01,075
- They use the flesh, too.
- For God's sakes!

1067
01:33:01,302 --> 01:33:05,739
They're not entering this apartment
again or coming near the baby.

1068
01:33:06,016 --> 01:33:08,450
They're old people with old friends!

1069
01:33:08,643 --> 01:33:11,237
Dr Shand happens
to play the recorder!

1070
01:33:11,437 --> 01:33:15,476
I'm not taking any chances.
We'll sublet, move out.

1071
01:33:15,733 --> 01:33:18,964
We are not.
We'll talk about it later.

1072
01:33:22,323 --> 01:33:25,474
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

1073
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,339
- Just this last chapter.
- Not today.

1074
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:30,492
Look. Your hands are shaking.

1075
01:33:30,664 --> 01:33:32,655
Come on. Give it to me.

1076
01:33:32,832 --> 01:33:35,744
I mean it, now. Give it to me.

1077
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:46,667
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

1078
01:33:46,845 --> 01:33:49,803
- What was the name? Marchado?
- Marcato.

1079
01:33:50,014 --> 01:33:52,528
He told me
his father was an importer.

1080
01:33:52,726 --> 01:33:57,083
I understand how disturbed you must
be with him for a neighbour.

1081
01:33:57,355 --> 01:34:00,552
I don't want anything to do with him.

1082
01:34:00,775 --> 01:34:03,130
I can't take the slightest chance.

1083
01:34:03,319 --> 01:34:05,549
Any mother would feel the same.

1084
01:34:05,738 --> 01:34:11,017
Is there any chance that Minnie put
something harmful in those drinks?

1085
01:34:11,326 --> 01:34:14,477
No, Rosemary.
I' d have seen evidence long ago.

1086
01:34:14,705 --> 01:34:17,265
I won't take anything else from them.

1087
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:22,657
I can give you some pills that'll be
adequate these last few weeks.

1088
01:34:22,963 --> 01:34:27,434
In a way, this may be the answer
to Minnie and Roman's problem, too.

1089
01:34:27,717 --> 01:34:30,470
- What do you mean?
- Roman's very ill.

1090
01:34:30,678 --> 01:34:34,387
Confidentially, he has no more
than a month or two left.

1091
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:37,359
He wanted to visit
his favourite cities.

1092
01:34:37,559 --> 01:34:41,472
They didn't want to offend you
by leaving before the birth.

1093
01:34:41,729 --> 01:34:43,526
I'm sorry to hear that.

1094
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:47,478
He' d be extremely embarrassed
if he knew you found out.

1095
01:34:47,735 --> 01:34:51,205
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.

1096
01:34:51,448 --> 01:34:53,200
I'll say I spoke to you.

1097
01:34:53,367 --> 01:34:56,837
- Will they leave on Sunday?
- I'll see to it.

1098
01:34:59,789 --> 01:35:04,465
Our thoughts are gonna be with you
till you're all happy and thin again,

1099
01:35:04,751 --> 01:35:08,460
your sweet little boy or girl
laying safely in your arms.

1100
01:35:08,714 --> 01:35:12,753
- Thanks for everything.
- Make Guy send us lots of pictures.

1101
01:35:13,009 --> 01:35:14,203
Yes.

1102
01:35:14,344 --> 01:35:17,381
I won't wish you luck
because you won't need it.

1103
01:35:17,597 --> 01:35:19,553
You'll have a happy life.

1104
01:35:19,725 --> 01:35:22,159
Have a good trip
and come back safely.

1105
01:35:22,351 --> 01:35:27,425
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik
or Pescara or maybe Majorca.

1106
01:35:27,731 --> 01:35:30,529
- We shall see, we shall see.
- Come back.

1107
01:35:30,734 --> 01:35:32,645
- Bye, Minnie.
- Yeah.

1108
01:35:32,819 --> 01:35:35,253
Goodbye, Roman. Bye-bye. Take care.

1109
01:35:35,448 --> 01:35:39,077
- Kennedy Airport, Pan Am Building.
- Bye!

1110
01:35:39,325 --> 01:35:40,883
Bye, Roman.

1111
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:44,809
Oh, boy.

1112
01:35:51,994 --> 01:35:55,907
- Where's my book?
- Oh, I put it in the garbage.

1113
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,047
What?

1114
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:02,565
I didn't want you upsetting yourself.

1115
01:36:02,754 --> 01:36:05,746
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.

1116
01:36:05,965 --> 01:36:09,162
- I wasn't thinking of that.
- That's terrible.

1117
01:36:09,385 --> 01:36:12,218
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

1118
01:36:18,769 --> 01:36:20,919
Watch out, lady!

1119
01:37:13,696 --> 01:37:16,085
"In some cults, it was believed

1120
01:37:16,282 --> 01:37:20,070
"that a personal possession
of the victim was necessary

1121
01:37:20,328 --> 01:37:25,038
"and spells cannot be cast without
one of the victim's belongings."

1122
01:37:25,332 --> 01:37:27,721
- Yeah?
- Is this Donald Baumgart?

1123
01:37:27,918 --> 01:37:31,308
- That's right.
- This is Rosemary Woodhouse,

1124
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:33,218
Guy Woodhouse's wife.

1125
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,575
- Oh, yes.
- I want to know...

1126
01:37:35,758 --> 01:37:40,468
You must be a happy lady,
living in the Bram...

1127
01:37:40,763 --> 01:37:45,120
- I wanted to know how you are.
- Well, bless your heart.

1128
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:48,145
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?

1129
01:37:48,354 --> 01:37:52,233
Well, I'm splendid.
I've only broke six glasses today.

1130
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,436
Guy and I are both very unhappy

1131
01:37:56,611 --> 01:38:00,160
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1132
01:38:02,741 --> 01:38:06,620
Ah, what the hell.
That's the way it goes, right?

1133
01:38:07,914 --> 01:38:12,066
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.

1134
01:38:12,335 --> 01:38:17,489
Visit? No... Oh, you mean
the day we met for drinks?

1135
01:38:17,798 --> 01:38:20,187
Yes, that's what I meant.

1136
01:38:20,383 --> 01:38:23,739
By the way,
he has something of yours, you know.

1137
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:25,722
What do you mean?

1138
01:38:25,888 --> 01:38:28,641
- Don't...don't you know?
- No.

1139
01:38:28,849 --> 01:38:31,158
Didn't you miss anything that day?

1140
01:38:31,352 --> 01:38:35,140
You...you don't mean my tie, do you?

1141
01:38:35,397 --> 01:38:36,750
Yes.

1142
01:38:36,898 --> 01:38:40,015
Well, he's got mine,
and I've got his.

1143
01:38:40,235 --> 01:38:43,511
- He can have it back.
- I'm sorry...

1144
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:46,970
Doesn't matter to me now
what colour tie I wear.

1145
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:52,479
- I thought he' d only borrowed it.
- No, no. It was a trade.

1146
01:38:52,788 --> 01:38:57,782
- Or...do you think he stole it?
- I have to hang up now.

1147
01:38:58,086 --> 01:39:01,715
I just wanted to know
if there' d been any improvement.

1148
01:39:01,964 --> 01:39:04,956
No, there isn't.
It was nice of you to call.

1149
01:39:43,003 --> 01:39:47,519
- You aren't in labour?
- No, but I have to see the doctor.

1150
01:39:47,799 --> 01:39:51,155
But he has to leave at five,
and there is Mrs Byron.

1151
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:54,457
- I'm sure he'll see you. Sit down.
- Thank you.

1152
01:40:16,201 --> 01:40:20,399
- How is it out there?
- Oh, awful. 94.

1153
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:25,198
- See you next week.
- Yes, I will.

1154
01:40:30,798 --> 01:40:33,835
- You're due any day, aren't you?
- Tuesday.

1155
01:40:34,051 --> 01:40:36,804
Smart to get it over with
before August.

1156
01:40:38,388 --> 01:40:41,778
Mrs Byron? He'll see you right after.

1157
01:40:42,017 --> 01:40:45,214
Well, let's see, um...July the 10th?

1158
01:40:45,436 --> 01:40:47,586
- What time?
- Four o ' clock?

1159
01:40:47,772 --> 01:40:50,161
- Fine.
- All right. See you then.

1160
01:40:50,357 --> 01:40:54,555
- Thank you. Bye-bye. Good luck.
- Thank you.

1161
01:41:01,743 --> 01:41:04,541
That smells nice. What is it?

1162
01:41:06,414 --> 01:41:09,167
Oh, my... It's called Detchema.

1163
01:41:09,376 --> 01:41:13,494
It's better than your regular,
if you don't mind my saying.

1164
01:41:13,754 --> 01:41:17,349
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.

1165
01:41:17,591 --> 01:41:20,947
Good. Maybe the doctor
will follow your example.

1166
01:41:26,475 --> 01:41:29,228
- Dr Sapirstein?
- Yes. The aftershave.

1167
01:41:29,436 --> 01:41:33,395
Well, it isn't, is it? I don't think
he has a good luck charm.

1168
01:41:33,648 --> 01:41:36,640
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while.

1169
01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:41,091
And when he does... Oh, boy.
Haven't you ever noticed?

1170
01:41:41,363 --> 01:41:42,842
No.

1171
01:41:42,991 --> 01:41:46,506
Maybe you thought it was your own
you were smelling.

1172
01:41:46,743 --> 01:41:48,699
What is it, a chemical thing?

1173
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:53,546
Will you ex cuse me a moment, please?
My husband is waiting outside.

1174
01:41:53,834 --> 01:41:56,667
I have to go and tell him something.
I'll be back in a minute.

1175
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:48,321
- Dr Hill's office.
- Dr Hill, please.

1176
01:42:48,551 --> 01:42:51,941
Would you like to leave a message?

1177
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:56,173
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1178
01:42:56,434 --> 01:43:01,462
Woodhouse. Would you ask him to
call me back right away, please?

1179
01:43:01,772 --> 01:43:06,766
Uh...my number is 475-2598.

1180
01:43:07,069 --> 01:43:09,742
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1181
01:43:09,947 --> 01:43:11,300
All right.

1182
01:43:20,916 --> 01:43:23,794
Quickly, please, Dr Hill, call me.

1183
01:43:30,966 --> 01:43:34,322
Oh, oh, really?
Did he really say that?

1184
01:43:34,553 --> 01:43:36,783
Oh, he didn't say that?

1185
01:43:36,972 --> 01:43:39,725
What else was it that he said?

1186
01:43:39,933 --> 01:43:43,642
Oh, that's wonderful.
That's wonder... That's marvellous.

1187
01:43:43,895 --> 01:43:45,806
Yes. Dr Hill?

1188
01:43:45,981 --> 01:43:49,212
- Rosemary Woodhouse?
- Yes.

1189
01:43:49,442 --> 01:43:52,400
- Are you Dr Hill's patient?
- No.

1190
01:43:52,612 --> 01:43:55,729
Um, yes, I mean,
well, I've seen him once.

1191
01:43:55,948 --> 01:43:59,736
Um, please tell him he has
to speak to me. It's important.

1192
01:43:59,994 --> 01:44:02,667
- Tell him to call me, hm?
- All right.

1193
01:44:02,871 --> 01:44:04,224
Thank you.

1194
01:44:11,546 --> 01:44:14,379
All of them. All of them.

1195
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:17,388
All in it together. All of them.

1196
01:44:17,593 --> 01:44:19,788
All of them witches.

1197
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:22,404
Don't worry, little Andy or Jenny,

1198
01:44:22,599 --> 01:44:25,432
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.

1199
01:44:28,604 --> 01:44:30,754
Yes. Dr...

1200
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:32,851
- Mrs Woodhouse?
- Yes!

1201
01:44:33,025 --> 01:44:35,698
Oh, thank you,
thank you for calling me.

1202
01:44:35,903 --> 01:44:38,258
I thought you were in California.

1203
01:44:38,446 --> 01:44:43,315
No. No, l-I've been to another
doctor, and he isn't good, Dr Hill.

1204
01:44:43,618 --> 01:44:48,567
He's been lying to me and giving me
unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.

1205
01:44:48,873 --> 01:44:52,752
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me June 28th?

1206
01:44:53,002 --> 01:44:56,392
- I want you to deliver it.
- Mrs Woodhouse...

1207
01:44:56,631 --> 01:45:01,307
Please, let me talk to you.
Let me explain what's been going on.

1208
01:45:01,593 --> 01:45:05,745
I can't stay too long here.
They'll be coming, looking for me.

1209
01:45:06,014 --> 01:45:10,724
Dr Hill? Dr Hill, there's a plot...
I know that sounds crazy.

1210
01:45:11,018 --> 01:45:14,647
You're probably thinking,
"This girl has flipped,"

1211
01:45:14,898 --> 01:45:19,016
but I haven't flipped,
Dr Hill, I swear, by all the saints.

1212
01:45:19,277 --> 01:45:22,428
There are plots against people,
aren't there?

1213
01:45:22,656 --> 01:45:27,366
- I suppose there are.
- There's one against me and my baby.

1214
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:32,574
- Come see me tomorrow after five.
- Now! Right now.

1215
01:45:32,872 --> 01:45:37,502
Mrs Woodhouse, I'm home. I've
been up since yesterday morning...

1216
01:45:37,794 --> 01:45:40,388
I beg you. I beg you.

1217
01:45:41,673 --> 01:45:43,903
I can't stay here.

1218
01:45:44,926 --> 01:45:47,838
- My office at eight o ' clock.
- Thank you!

1219
01:45:48,054 --> 01:45:50,010
- Oh, wait! Dr Hill?
- Yes?

1220
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:54,253
- My husband may call you...
- I'm not gonna speak to anyone.

1221
01:45:54,518 --> 01:45:57,351
- I'm gonna take a nap.
- Thank you.

1222
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,375
Keep the change.

1223
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:34,305
Uh, driver, please,

1224
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:38,431
could you wait and watch until...
until I'm inside the door?

1225
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,192
He lied.
He said we were going to Hollywood.

1226
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:00,845
The worst thing is he's involved.

1227
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:03,872
He sleeps in pyjamas now.
He never used to.

1228
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:05,994
He's probably hiding a mark.

1229
01:47:06,168 --> 01:47:10,047
They give you marks when you join...
all sorts of rituals.

1230
01:47:10,297 --> 01:47:13,972
They hold Sabbaths there.
You could hear them.

1231
01:47:14,218 --> 01:47:17,130
Guy, my husband,
said it was Dr Shand,

1232
01:47:17,346 --> 01:47:19,496
one of them playing a recorder.

1233
01:47:19,682 --> 01:47:24,198
Now, how did he know it was Dr Shand
unless he was there with them?

1234
01:47:24,477 --> 01:47:26,627
Um, they're very clever people.

1235
01:47:26,813 --> 01:47:29,885
They planned everything
from the beginning.

1236
01:47:30,108 --> 01:47:32,861
They probably made
some deal with Guy.

1237
01:47:33,069 --> 01:47:34,866
They gave him success

1238
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:38,989
and he promised them our baby
to use in their rituals.

1239
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:43,996
I know this sounds crazy,
but I've...l've got books here. Look.

1240
01:47:45,247 --> 01:47:48,762
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart,

1241
01:47:49,001 --> 01:47:50,559
they put a spell on him.

1242
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:55,067
They cast a spell on him and made him
blind so Guy could get his part.

1243
01:47:55,339 --> 01:47:57,091
Look, here.

1244
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:04,345
I had this friend, Edward Hutchins,
a writer. He wrote stories for boys.

1245
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:08,030
He was my good friend
since I first came to New York.

1246
01:48:08,269 --> 01:48:10,419
- May I keep this?
- Yes, please.

1247
01:48:10,604 --> 01:48:14,722
And, look, anyway,
once Mr Hutchins came to visit me...

1248
01:48:14,983 --> 01:48:19,499
It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1249
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:24,058
I was suffering so... You can't
imagine how much I was suffering,

1250
01:48:24,325 --> 01:48:26,077
and they wouldn't help me.

1251
01:48:26,244 --> 01:48:29,554
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.

1252
01:48:29,788 --> 01:48:32,063
Also witches' stuff, tannis root.

1253
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:35,799
Hutch came and immediately
saw something was wrong.

1254
01:48:36,045 --> 01:48:38,001
He...he knew about witches.

1255
01:48:38,172 --> 01:48:41,642
Guy rushed in with his makeup on,
which he never did.

1256
01:48:41,883 --> 01:48:46,320
They probably called him to come home
and steal one of Hutch's belongings.

1257
01:48:46,596 --> 01:48:50,669
He took his glove
and they put a spell on him, too.

1258
01:48:50,934 --> 01:48:54,688
Put him in a coma.
Three months later he died.

1259
01:48:54,937 --> 01:48:58,725
Maybe all this is coincidence,
but one thing is for sure,

1260
01:48:58,982 --> 01:49:01,177
they have a coven and want my baby.

1261
01:49:04,696 --> 01:49:06,732
Certainly seems that way.

1262
01:49:16,498 --> 01:49:18,932
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

1263
01:49:19,127 --> 01:49:20,799
I don't believe in witchcraft,

1264
01:49:20,962 --> 01:49:24,318
but there are plenty
of crazy people in this city.

1265
01:49:24,548 --> 01:49:29,258
- The doctor's name is Shand?
- No, Dr Shand is one of them.

1266
01:49:29,553 --> 01:49:33,910
- The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
- Abraham Sapirstein?

1267
01:49:34,182 --> 01:49:36,821
Yeah.

1268
01:49:37,018 --> 01:49:40,294
- Do you know him?
- I've met him once or twice.

1269
01:49:40,522 --> 01:49:42,877
To look at him, you' d never think...

1270
01:49:43,066 --> 01:49:45,899
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

1271
01:49:46,111 --> 01:49:50,024
Would you like to go
into Mount Sinai now, this evening?

1272
01:49:50,281 --> 01:49:53,717
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?

1273
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:55,987
It's difficult, but we'll try.

1274
01:49:56,162 --> 01:49:58,995
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.

1275
01:49:59,206 --> 01:50:03,836
Thanks. Anything they've got,
even a broom closet would be fine.

1276
01:50:04,127 --> 01:50:06,800
I hope we can do better than that.

1277
01:50:12,177 --> 01:50:15,931
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.

1278
01:50:18,307 --> 01:50:19,706
Oh, should I undress now?

1279
01:50:19,851 --> 01:50:22,411
No. It'll take about a half hour.

1280
01:50:22,603 --> 01:50:24,594
You just lie down, rest.

1281
01:50:37,075 --> 01:50:39,350
God bless Dr Hill.

1282
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:48,928
Everything's going to be
OK now, Andy or Jenny.

1283
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:54,244
We're going to be in a nice,
clean hospital with no visitors.

1284
01:51:15,612 --> 01:51:17,887
Monsters.

1285
01:51:18,822 --> 01:51:21,177
Monsters.

1286
01:51:25,203 --> 01:51:28,559
Unspeakable. Unspeakable.

1287
01:52:00,987 --> 01:52:02,739
I was sleeping.

1288
01:52:16,834 --> 01:52:20,873
Come with us quietly, Rosemary.
Don't argue or make a scene.

1289
01:52:21,130 --> 01:52:23,724
If you say
anything more about witches

1290
01:52:23,925 --> 01:52:26,564
we'll take you to a mental hospital.

1291
01:52:26,761 --> 01:52:30,117
You don't want that, do you?
So put your shoes on.

1292
01:52:30,348 --> 01:52:34,057
We just want to take you home.
No one's going to hurt you.

1293
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:36,346
Or the baby. Put your shoes on.

1294
01:52:54,870 --> 01:52:56,428
She's fine now.

1295
01:52:56,581 --> 01:53:00,460
- We're going to go home and rest.
- That's all it takes.

1296
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:03,508
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Glad I could help, sir.

1297
01:53:03,712 --> 01:53:05,464
It's a shame you had to come here.

1298
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:00,721
Good evening, Mrs Woodhouse.

1299
01:54:16,447 --> 01:54:18,039
Mrs Woodhouse!

1300
01:54:18,741 --> 01:54:20,459
Mrs Woodhouse!

1301
01:55:36,523 --> 01:55:38,798
- Come on, open up, Ro.
- Go to hell!

1302
01:55:38,983 --> 01:55:42,055
- Come on, honey.
- You promised them the baby!

1303
01:55:42,278 --> 01:55:44,394
I didn't promise them anything!

1304
01:55:44,572 --> 01:55:47,803
- Rosemary, you're...
- You, too!

1305
01:56:18,855 --> 01:56:20,811
- Hello?
- Elise?

1306
01:56:20,981 --> 01:56:24,940
- Mrs Dunstan is out.
- Who is this? Where is she?

1307
01:56:25,194 --> 01:56:27,867
- At the movies.
- This is Rosemary.

1308
01:56:28,071 --> 01:56:30,665
Ask her to call me
when she gets home.

1309
01:56:30,866 --> 01:56:34,222
It's terribly urgent.
Don't...don't forget.

1310
01:56:34,452 --> 01:56:37,410
- Don't worry. I'll tell her.
- Thank you.

1311
01:56:44,169 --> 01:56:48,845
- We don't want to hurt you, Ro.
- We're your friends, Rosemary.

1312
01:56:49,132 --> 01:56:52,681
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Honest there isn't.

1313
01:56:52,927 --> 01:56:56,715
- This is just a mild sedative.
- I wouldn't let anyone...

1314
01:57:01,561 --> 01:57:03,119
Help me!

1315
01:57:03,271 --> 01:57:06,627
- Oh, Ro, baby.
- Somebody help me!

1316
01:57:17,909 --> 01:57:21,140
Wait a minute. Wait a minute now.

1317
01:57:26,375 --> 01:57:29,765
- We're in labour here.
- Here?

1318
01:57:30,004 --> 01:57:34,361
You'll be all right, baby. You're
going to be perfectly all right.

1319
01:57:34,634 --> 01:57:38,627
There were supposed to be doctors,
hospitals!

1320
01:57:38,887 --> 01:57:43,403
Everything...clean and sterile!

1321
01:57:43,684 --> 01:57:46,244
Hello? She isn't here, Elise.

1322
01:57:52,359 --> 01:57:56,193
Oh, Andy... Andy or Jenny...

1323
01:57:56,446 --> 01:57:59,643
I...l'm sorry, my little darling.

1324
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:02,807
Forgive me.

1325
01:58:13,795 --> 01:58:15,672
Hi.

1326
01:58:20,343 --> 01:58:22,254
Hi.

1327
01:58:24,138 --> 01:58:26,652
Is it all right?

1328
01:58:26,849 --> 01:58:30,000
Yes, it's fine.

1329
01:58:32,187 --> 01:58:36,339
- What is it?
- A boy.

1330
01:58:40,863 --> 01:58:43,172
Really? A boy?

1331
01:58:51,831 --> 01:58:56,029
- And it's all right?
- Yes.

1332
01:59:15,979 --> 01:59:17,856
Where is it?

1333
01:59:18,022 --> 01:59:20,582
Oh, my goodness.

1334
01:59:20,774 --> 01:59:23,925
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.

1335
01:59:24,153 --> 01:59:26,064
The baby, where is it?

1336
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:29,036
Oh, uh, you wait here one minute.

1337
01:59:30,993 --> 01:59:32,745
Where's my baby?

1338
01:59:32,911 --> 01:59:36,824
Uh, I'll go find Dr Abe.
Just wait.

1339
01:59:52,889 --> 01:59:54,845
Where's the baby?

1340
01:59:57,851 --> 02:00:01,605
- Where is it?
- Honey...

1341
02:00:01,854 --> 02:00:06,848
There were complications, but nothing
that will affect future births.

1342
02:00:09,403 --> 02:00:11,075
It's...

1343
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:14,958
Dead. It was in the wrong position.

1344
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,913
In hospital
I might have done something.

1345
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:20,270
Honey, we can have others.

1346
02:00:20,455 --> 02:00:23,686
You can try again in a few months.

1347
02:00:23,918 --> 02:00:25,670
When you're better.

1348
02:00:25,835 --> 02:00:29,987
No. I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

1349
02:00:30,256 --> 02:00:32,724
You're lying! It didn't die!

1350
02:00:32,926 --> 02:00:35,121
You took it! You're lying!

1351
02:00:35,303 --> 02:00:37,897
You're witches! You're lying!

1352
02:00:38,098 --> 02:00:41,010
You're lying! You're lying!

1353
02:00:41,684 --> 02:00:43,242
You're lying!

1354
02:00:51,152 --> 02:00:55,225
Abe says it's called...pre-partum.

1355
02:00:55,489 --> 02:00:58,322
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

1356
02:00:58,533 --> 02:01:02,208
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.

1357
02:01:04,831 --> 02:01:09,825
Uh, I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,

1358
02:01:10,128 --> 02:01:15,122
but, um, how come you thought
that Abe and I joined the party?

1359
02:01:20,095 --> 02:01:24,691
Let's face it, darling,
you had the...pre-partum crazies.

1360
02:01:26,268 --> 02:01:29,977
Now you're gonna rest
and you're gonna get over them.

1361
02:01:30,230 --> 02:01:34,701
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

1362
02:01:34,984 --> 02:01:37,179
but now everything's gonna be roses.

1363
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,989
Paramount's right where we want them,
Universal's interested,

1364
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:44,676
and we're gonna blow this town
and be in beautiful Beverly

1365
02:01:44,909 --> 02:01:49,903
with a pool and a spice garden,
the whole schmeer, and kids, too, Ro.

1366
02:01:50,207 --> 02:01:53,005
Scout's honour.
You heard what Abe said.

1367
02:01:56,421 --> 02:01:59,254
Now, I got to run now and get famous.

1368
02:02:02,177 --> 02:02:04,691
Let me...see your shoulder.

1369
02:02:07,265 --> 02:02:09,699
Let me see your shoulder.

1370
02:02:09,892 --> 02:02:13,601
- Are you kidding?
- Your left shoulder.

1371
02:02:13,855 --> 02:02:16,210
All right. Anything you say.

1372
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:24,195
I generally prefer doing this
to music. Left shoulder.

1373
02:02:27,283 --> 02:02:28,398
Right shoulder.

1374
02:02:31,036 --> 02:02:34,028
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.

1375
02:02:40,129 --> 02:02:43,007
The high pressure area
causing this heat...

1376
02:02:44,924 --> 02:02:48,473
And will be staying with us
through the week.

1377
02:02:48,845 --> 02:02:51,917
It will be overcast
upstate New York as well

1378
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:55,530
with the possibility
of thunder showers tonight

1379
02:02:55,768 --> 02:02:58,043
clearing by tomorrow night.

1380
02:02:58,229 --> 02:03:02,825
All you people leaving the city
this weekend should find it hot.

1381
02:03:26,004 --> 02:03:29,679
Do you hear a baby crying?

1382
02:03:29,925 --> 02:03:32,314
Why, no, I don't, dear.

1383
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:36,423
Now, into your bed now.
It's time for you to take your pill.

1384
02:03:46,108 --> 02:03:48,542
Did you turn the air conditioner off?

1385
02:03:49,653 --> 02:03:51,609
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.

1386
02:03:51,779 --> 02:03:54,612
People are actually dying,
it's so hot.

1387
02:04:09,462 --> 02:04:12,135
What do you do with the milk?

1388
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:16,094
Why, uh, throw it away.
Your pill, Rosemary.

1389
02:04:24,018 --> 02:04:26,691
Hello, girls.

1390
02:04:26,895 --> 02:04:30,012
95 out.

1391
02:04:30,523 --> 02:04:33,640
Some new people
moved on in up in eight.

1392
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:36,169
Do they have a baby?

1393
02:04:37,864 --> 02:04:39,422
How' d you know that?

1394
02:04:40,617 --> 02:04:42,653
I heard it crying.

1395
02:04:43,954 --> 02:04:45,592
Oh, wait a minute.

1396
02:04:48,999 --> 02:04:53,072
- Oh, no. Don't do that.
- Why not?

1397
02:04:53,337 --> 02:04:56,773
Uh, a little messy, that's all.

1398
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:48,789
Easy, easy.

1399
02:08:05,976 --> 02:08:08,854
Got her too high.

1400
02:08:33,877 --> 02:08:37,392
Oh, hell, Hayato.
You're making fun of me.

1401
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:40,145
You're pulling my leg, like we say.

1402
02:09:09,494 --> 02:09:13,851
Rosemary, go back to bed. You know
you're not supposed to be up.

1403
02:09:14,123 --> 02:09:17,274
- The mother?
- Rosemary...

1404
02:09:17,586 --> 02:09:20,737
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.

1405
02:10:04,129 --> 02:10:06,802
What have you done to it?

1406
02:10:07,006 --> 02:10:09,679
What have you done to its eyes?

1407
02:10:09,884 --> 02:10:11,636
He has his father's eyes.

1408
02:10:16,807 --> 02:10:20,243
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.

1409
02:10:20,477 --> 02:10:23,355
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?!

1410
02:10:23,563 --> 02:10:25,793
Satan is his father, not Guy.

1411
02:10:25,983 --> 02:10:30,056
He came up from hell
and begat a son of mortal woman.

1412
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,276
- Hail, Satan.
- Hail, Satan.

1413
02:10:32,447 --> 02:10:35,359
Satan is his father,
and his name is Adrian.

1414
02:10:35,575 --> 02:10:40,012
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

1415
02:10:40,288 --> 02:10:45,203
He shall wreak vengeance in the name
of the burned and the tortured!

1416
02:10:45,501 --> 02:10:48,015
- Hail, Adrian!
- Hail, Adrian!

1417
02:10:48,211 --> 02:10:50,167
Hail, Satan! Hail, Satan!

1418
02:10:50,339 --> 02:10:51,931
Hail, Satan!

1419
02:10:52,091 --> 02:10:56,289
He chose you. Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.

1420
02:10:56,553 --> 02:10:59,670
He wanted you to be
the mother of his only son.

1421
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:02,279
His power is stronger than stronger!

1422
02:11:02,475 --> 02:11:05,228
His might shall last
longer than longer!

1423
02:11:05,436 --> 02:11:08,667
- Hail, Satan!
- No!

1424
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:13,035
It can't be! No!

1425
02:11:13,485 --> 02:11:16,318
- Go look at his hands.
- And his feet.

1426
02:11:18,366 --> 02:11:20,721
Oh, God!

1427
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:25,546
- God is dead! Satan lives!
- Hail, Satan!

1428
02:11:25,789 --> 02:11:28,349
- The year is one!
- Hail, Satan!

1429
02:11:28,541 --> 02:11:31,613
- The year is one and God is done!
- Oh, God!

1430
02:11:31,836 --> 02:11:35,954
- The year is one!
- Hail, Adrian!

1431
02:11:36,215 --> 02:11:38,365
Hail, Satan!

1432
02:11:38,551 --> 02:11:42,749
Why don't you help us out, Rosemary?
Be a real mother to Adrian.

1433
02:11:43,013 --> 02:11:45,891
You don't have to join
if you don't want to.

1434
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:48,136
Just be a mother to your baby.

1435
02:11:49,352 --> 02:11:54,107
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
It's not right.

1436
02:11:56,734 --> 02:11:58,486
Think about it, Rosemary.

1437
02:12:11,873 --> 02:12:13,386
Oh, God!

1438
02:12:13,542 --> 02:12:16,659
Oh, shut up or we'll kill you,
milk or no milk.

1439
02:12:16,879 --> 02:12:21,236
You shut up. Rosemary's his mother.
Show some respect.

1440
02:12:23,426 --> 02:12:27,544
Come, my friend.
Come see him. Come see the child.

1441
02:12:37,857 --> 02:12:40,132
What would you like to drink?

1442
02:12:41,026 --> 02:12:45,383
They promised you wouldn't be hurt,
and you haven't been, really.

1443
02:12:45,655 --> 02:12:49,614
I mean, supposing you had the baby
and you lost it.

1444
02:12:50,744 --> 02:12:52,700
Wouldn't that be the same?

1445
02:12:52,871 --> 02:12:56,261
And we're getting
so much in return, Ro.

1446
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,793
Oh, Guy, let me introduce
you to Argyron Stavropoulos.

1447
02:13:11,055 --> 02:13:13,728
How proud you must be.

1448
02:13:13,932 --> 02:13:16,605
Is this the mother?
Why in the name of...

1449
02:13:16,810 --> 02:13:20,280
- Here, drink this.
- What's in it? Tannis root?

1450
02:13:20,521 --> 02:13:24,275
Just plain, ordinary Lipton's tea.
You drink it.

1451
02:13:56,055 --> 02:14:00,606
- Get away from here. Roman!
- You're rocking him too fast.

1452
02:14:00,892 --> 02:14:03,486
Sit down! Put her where she belongs.

1453
02:14:03,687 --> 02:14:07,236
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.

1454
02:14:07,483 --> 02:14:10,793
- Mind your own business.
- Let Rosemary rock him.

1455
02:14:11,028 --> 02:14:13,861
- Sit with the others.
- She's liable to...

1456
02:14:14,072 --> 02:14:16,791
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.

1457
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,956
Rock him.

1458
02:14:30,086 --> 02:14:33,362
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.

1459
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:35,501
Aren't you his mother?
