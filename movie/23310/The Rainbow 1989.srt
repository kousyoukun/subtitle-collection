1
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,759
Ursula!

2
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,800
Ursula!

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,400
Ursula, come back 'ere!

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,000
Ursula!

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,359
Ursula!

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,079
Come back 'ere! It's dangerous!

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,600
Ursula! Wait for me!

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,559
Who didn't come, then?! Was it you, Miss Puddleduck?

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,119
Were you off for a swim?

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,960
No.

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,860
What is it, me lady?

12
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:12,959
I want that, Daddy.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,959
Can't have it, it's not for catching

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,780
Want it!

15
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:22,800
It's too far off, lass. If you're a good girl I'll make you one for tea.

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,440
They were naughty to fight. Losing their feathers. They'll be sorry when it's cold.

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,600
I just saved this one from the river

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,200
Off you get.

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,560
Perhaps we'll have that gate fixed.

20
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:49,560
You left the door open!

21
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,759
What if I did?! The baker came and the baby woke up.

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,260
Why do you niggle me?! I don't just sit around designing lace hankies.

23
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:00,559
Soup again? You spoil me.

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,159
Oh, is our little blackbird tuning up? Sing up, lad, and drown your mother out.

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,559
You put such pressure in my head.

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,559
Oh, get off!

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,000
♪ When the pie was opened The birds began to sing

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,200
♪ Wasn't that a dainty dish... ♪

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,159
Still there, Daddy. Can't I have it?

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,759
You're a persistent little madam. I'd not forgotten.

31
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,159
There you are. On you jump.

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,120
There we go. What about that, then?

33
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,439
Want a taste?

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,960
Uh-uh.

35
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,959
A little taste. Just a little one. No?

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,959
Uh.

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,959
Oh, I see. You want the real one.

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Well, you can't have it, my lass.

39
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,000
"And again, I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle...

40
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,200
..than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,959
The collection is for Mrs Hartley...

42
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,959
..widowed by the Grange Pit tragedy. I know you will give generously.

43
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,959
On a happier note, there will be a resumption of christenings.

44
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,600
Thanks to the restoration of the font by our organist - Will Brangwen.

45
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,400
He's like my dolly.

46
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,320
This church takes up too much time, but it's a fine hand you've carved.

47
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,040
It's an ogre's hand.

48
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,359
It's the hand of God, Billy.

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,359
Assisting at the birth of Eve.

50
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,600
He's not a midwife!

51
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,759
It was my hand you used as a model.

52
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,159
That's not so, it's after Donatello's "Frances".

53
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,780
Perhaps that's how it started.

54
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:15,800
Oh, never!

55
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,960
For all you know, Donatello may have used his wife as a model.

56
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:27,359
Don't be ridiculous. The hand of God is a man's hand.

57
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,359
Like taking Eve out of Adam's body, when man is born of woman? The impudence of men!

58
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,159
Oh, Mother, don't fuss so!

59
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,159
I have said, Ursula, do not speak to me like that.

60
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,159
How could a great big camel pass through an eye of a needle?

61
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,000
With great difficulty, I'd think.

62
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,400
It's locked. Open the door, Ursula.

63
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,559
She won't answer, she's dead.

64
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,759
Go away. I'm not dead. What do you want?

65
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,759
Mother says you have to come down to dinner.

66
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,200
There's a soldier downstairs with Uncle Henry.

67
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,200
You're not fibbing, are you?! Cos I'll pull your hair out. Even if it is Sunday.

68
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,959
I always used to ask strangers to stay.

69
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,759
It was rather trying for my parents.

70
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,159
It's our Lazarus. And Billy said you were dead.

71
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,940
Might as well be sometimes.

72
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,639
I wanted some peace. I didn't realise you were coming.

73
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,639
Or she'd have had a sherry.

74
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,200
Likes a tipple, does she?

75
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,759
Give your Uncle Henry a kiss.

76
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,359
Drink the health of my friend - Lt Anton Skrebensky.

77
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,159
He's staying at the hall. His father was the parish priest.

78
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Are you staying long?

79
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,160
This is my last day.

80
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:05,759
I have to report back tomorrow.

81
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,360
To what do you report?

82
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm in the Engineers. And you? I suppose you're at school.

83
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,759
My last term. I'm taking my matriculation exams soon.

84
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,359
You'll be going out to work?

85
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,159
Don't put ideas in her head. My daughters don't need to work.

86
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm considering my field of action.

87
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,680
There's stockings need mending. They could be your field of action.

88
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,159
What would you like to be?

89
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,120
I don't know. A teacher, perhaps.

90
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,159
I could never study. The brains of the Army are in the Engineers.

91
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,959
I joined to get the credit of other people's brains.

92
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,159
Brains don't matter.

93
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,239
What does matter, then?

94
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,679
Whether people have courage or not.

95
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,879
Courage for what?

96
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,799
For everything.

97
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,159
Like a soldier, you mean?

98
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,159
That's another field of action you wouldn't like.

99
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,159
She should join the Royal Engineers.

100
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,600
No need for courage to build a privvy.

101
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,759
Are you not lonely, being an orphan?

102
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,400
I have got a guardian. And Henry. And my aunts.

103
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm really fond of them all. But my real home is the Army.

104
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,959
Do you like being on your own?

105
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,000
I think so.

106
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,959
I went to school early.

107
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,380
The outside world was more of a home to me than the vicarage.

108
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,800
This house used to be a vicarage.

109
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,000
Really?

110
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
Do you not feel like...

111
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,839
..like a bird, flown out of its own latitude?

112
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,400
I find things much as I like them.

113
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,980
You look very lazy.

114
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,000
I am lazy.

115
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,360
You look really floppy.

116
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,360
I am floppy.

117
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:23,759
Can't you stop?

118
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,959
I don't want to stop.

119
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,780
It looks like there isn't a bone in your body.

120
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:31,000
That's how I like to feel.

121
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,359
I don't admire your taste.

122
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,560
That's my misfortune.

123
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,920
Damn it! Why can't I rock?!

124
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,280
Men don't rock themselves.

125
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,400
Girls don't pull men's hair.

126
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,400
You've seen that they do.

127
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,000
My father used to rock me on the swingboats.

128
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,280
Would you like to go on one again?

129
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:59,400
Oh, I didn't mean...

130
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,360
When?

131
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,359
Now!

132
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,400
You arrange it with mother while I change.

133
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,800
Our families go a long way back.

134
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,040
My grandmother told me stories of her life in Poland.

135
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,439
She knew your father in Warsaw.

136
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,520
She married his friend, Dr Lensky, just before the uprising. They fought together.

137
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,559
Dr Lensky and Baron Skrebensky. Don't you find Polish names extremely musical?

138
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,559
They're a musical nation. And very patriotic. They make poor exiles.

139
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,400
They all die young, humming Chopin's "Funeral March".

140
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,460
You Lenskys seem to be an exception.

141
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:09,359
They say Granddad died with a stethoscope on.

142
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,959
He had connections with the medical profession and had a practice in Beldover. That's where Mum was born.

143
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,559
I've always thought it romantic to have Polish blood.

144
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,159
More than British? Is your father not romantic?

145
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,359
Of course, or he wouldn't have swept Mum off her feet.

146
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,759
They were married in that church. Shall we go in?

147
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,200
Oh, dear. I thought I'd escaped church parade today.

148
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,000
Come along.

149
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,359
­ Beg pardon, sir, didn't hear you.

150
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,359
This is dreadful.

151
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,559
Dreadful and wonderful.

152
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,000
Then let's stay a minute.

153
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,359
You loved flying high, didn't you?

154
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,200
Better than being earthbound. You'd think so if you lived in our house.

155
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,559
This reminds me of Ingram from my platoon.

156
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,359
Why's that?

157
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,360
He had a girl in Rochester. They'd make love in the cathedral.

158
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,360
How nice.

159
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:53,440
Ended badly. The verger caught them, got their names, made a row about it

160
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,759
What a shame. He shouldn't have objected.

161
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,159
He said it was a profanity.

162
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,800
No, I think it's right.

163
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,400
To make love in the house of God.

164
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,800
I promised your mother I'd have you home early, you've school tomorrow.

165
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,400
Come along, I'll buy you a lolly.

166
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,759
Push and glide! Push and glide!

167
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,759
Ethel, as the arms complete their stroke, bend the legs back.

168
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,359
Don't let your feet break water.

169
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,559
Push and glide! Heads steady. All right.

170
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,000
Come on, I'll race you.

171
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,759
I've won. But you've good form. What's your name?

172
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,800
Ursula, Miss Inger. Ursula Brangwen.

173
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Right, Ursula Brangwen.

174
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,920
Class dismissed. No lingering in the cubicles - Class Three are due.

175
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,159
Do you think it's wicked to let a man kiss you - a man you've just met?

176
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,759
I should think. It depends.

177
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,000
Real kisses, I mean. Not just flirting. He's a soldier.

178
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,759
Where did he kiss you?

179
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,800
In church.

180
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,959
I see. And what time was it?

181
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,200
Erm. About a quarter to seven.

182
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,800
Oh, yes, I think it'd be very wrong.

183
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,680
What do you think of the new athletics mistress?

184
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,200
Not a lot. She was rough with me.

185
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,800
Ursula. Ursula.

186
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
I enjoyed our race, did you?

187
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,400
Erm, yes. Yes, I did.

188
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,159
Tell me, have you a bicycle?

189
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,159
No. Er, yes.

190
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,800
My sister does, we share it.

191
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:20,000
Would you like to come for a swim on Saturday? I've a cottage on the river, you could stay for tea.

192
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,000
Thank you. Yes, I'd like that.

193
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,359
Come along, Class Three. Come on, girls. Come along.

194
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,400
Into the water. You'll be swimming like dolphins in no time.

195
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,200
NO, YOU CAN'T! I NEED IT! LISTEN TO ME!

196
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,800
STOP, WILL YA?! I SAID NO!

197
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,400
Stop! Oh, I hate you.

198
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,959
Mmm! Such peace.

199
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,159
Be more comfortable with your boots off. Here.

200
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,359
How do you spend your weekends?

201
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,159
Helping Mother. Going to church.

202
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,559
Church is peaceful.

203
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,759
Why do you laugh?

204
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,759
The last time it was anything but!

205
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,799
I was with a friend looking for seclusion.

206
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,040
Choir practice?

207
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,600
Restoration.

208
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,759
Do you think it's blasphemous to make love in church?

209
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,600
No. Merely uncomfortable.

210
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,200
Such narrow pews.

211
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,100
Or did you do it standing up in a confessional?

212
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,320
We were only kissing.

213
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,559
Oh, I thought you meant fucking. Who was he?

214
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,600
A soldier.

215
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,440
What's the matter?

216
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,359
My father was a soldier. Coarse brute.

217
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,180
Treated my mother little better than a whore.

218
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:14,200
How do you mean?

219
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,559
As a person in her own right my mother did not exist.

220
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,559
She was an instrument for his perverted sexuality.

221
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,000
Was there no love?

222
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,600
The best you'll ever get from a man is passion.

223
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,959
Even that can't last.

224
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,759
I think we're in for a storm - the milk's turned.

225
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,959
Perhaps I should be off.

226
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't say that, not before our swim.

227
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,000
In the rush I forgot my costume. Besides, it looks like rain.

228
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,159
In the water what do raindrops matter?

229
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,000
Besides, it's best in the rain.

230
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,239
It's safe, the grounds are private.

231
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,600
We'll undress inside and run down. It's all right.

232
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,600
Come on.

233
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,159
You're tickling me!

234
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,800
Relax! You're in the hands of a qualified osteopath.

235
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,600
That's lovely.

236
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,960
I think you better go soon, it's getting late.

237
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:33,159
Can I not stay with you?

238
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,159
Your parents wouldn't approve.

239
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,960
When will we see each other again?

240
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:39,960
Monday, silly.

241
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:42,000
Swimming class.

242
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,600
I meant like this.

243
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,959
I was thinking of taking a school party to the Lakes next weekend. Want to come?

244
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,559
I'm not that fond of hiking.

245
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,800
I wouldn't bother, then.

246
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,000
I meant a party of one.

247
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,440
I love hiking!

248
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,280
Your mother'll think you've been kidnapped. Come along.

249
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,600
You heard me. I need it to get the groceries.

250
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,400
I had to carry them home. What have you got to say?

251
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,800
Damn the groceries! I'm sick of being told what to do.

252
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,400
♪ We're bading in the sea, Mother

253
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,760
♪ We're bading in the sea, Mother... ♪

254
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,439
And I am standing here with your nightshirt.

255
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,980
♪ We're bading in the sea, Mother... ♪

256
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:50,600
Come on, Rupert, get up now.

257
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,559
Will somebody love me, Mother?

258
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,359
We say "bathing", not bading. We all love you.

259
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,000
But will somebody love me ?

260
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,759
Some man will love you, because that's your nature.

261
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,159
I hope he loves you for what you are, not what he wants of you.

262
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,000
What did you want for yourself?

263
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,000
What I've got.

264
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,860
Billy, where is your nightshirt?

265
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,560
I don't know.

266
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Then look for it!

267
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,560
Marie pulled my hair.

268
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, you two, get along.

269
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,359
We have a right to what we want.

270
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,759
Now then! What you up to?

271
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,680
Nothing.

272
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,680
Yes you are, you wicked lad. Up you get, plenty of room.

273
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,460
Why aren't they in bed?!

274
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:40,559
The children must live.

275
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,359
But I must live, too.

276
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,760
We all live together, lass.

277
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,600
My teacher's taking a party to the Lakes next weekend.

278
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,559
You're Uncle Henry's invited us to the hall on Saturday.

279
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,600
Anton'll be there.

280
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,000
I think not. I really must go with my school.

281
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,359
Your mother's right.

282
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,159
Men have fixed ideas of what a woman should be.

283
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,959
Any woman who fits their definition, they say they love her.

284
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,959
They're only in love with themselves.

285
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,559
Like a serpent who swallows his tail when he's hungry.

286
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,400
But women - they have fixed ideas, too.

287
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,200
Can you see it? Can you make out what it is?

288
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,159
No.

289
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,159
Can't you?

290
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,200
Up there, on the summit. The lion lays down with the lamb.

291
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,359
Can you see it now?

292
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes! It's good, isn't it?

293
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,780
Can we get up there?

294
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:00,600
Let's have a drink before we tackle it.

295
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,759
Wave to the ladies.

296
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,800
Hello!

297
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,359
How I love lions.

298
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,759
God is like a lion to me.

299
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,359
Not like those silly toy lambs in church.

300
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,359
Lambs or lions.

301
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,400
Buddha or Apollo. Christ or Zeus.

302
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,200
They're only symbols of man's instinctual desires - illusions.

303
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,800
Who do you worship?

304
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,200
I worship this.

305
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,559
I would like to be proud and strong like a lion.

306
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,800
Not weak like a lamb, who only exists to be loved and sacrificed.

307
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,200
To love and be loved are equally important.

308
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,400
When the lion lays down with the lamb in you, you'll know peace.

309
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,959
We're workin' the mine! Be off with you!

310
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,359
Didn't you read the sign, woman!

311
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,959
You are a monster. How dare you come here with your filthy mind?

312
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,000
Come on, Ursula!

313
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,200
Man is terrible. The works of man are more terrible still.

314
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,759
The mines are the most terrible of his works.

315
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,559
My Uncle Henry owns several of the Grange pits.

316
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,600
Really? Remember the painting at the cottage? It's Mack.

317
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,559
I sometimes model for the old rascal.

318
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,600
Mack!

319
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,559
We saw it so clearly from below. Where is it?

320
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,280
Where d'ya think? Use your eyes.

321
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:01,000
If you're looking for a public convenience it's behind a rock.

322
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,959
I'm looking for the lion and the lamb

323
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,200
It's behind you, silly.

324
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,600
It's an illusion - the lion laying down with the lamb.

325
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,400
You're the third person today to say that. Must be true.

326
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,959
Distance lends enchantment. This is Ursula, one of our favourite sorts.

327
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,800
Is she now?

328
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,440
Do you always meet casually on mountains?

329
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,559
More often in the studio. Do you think she'd pose for me, Fred?

330
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,200
Would you like to, Ursula?

331
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,280
I don't know, I'm a bit of a fidget. When?

332
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,000
There'll be some pocket money in it for you. How's next Saturday?

333
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,279
I'll come along, if you like.

334
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,800
No, it's all right.

335
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,920
I'm not a child.

336
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,400
I shall call it, "Experience Rewarding Innocence".

337
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,559
I generally choose titles with cynicism, but this is an exception.

338
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,800
I'd almost given up hope of finding purity in a girl your age.

339
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,240
Would you like me to smile?

340
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,359
It's not your face I'm painting at the moment.

341
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,359
You're a good girl, Ursula, are you not?

342
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,160
My parents don't always think so.

343
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,800
Parents seldom do.

344
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,959
Do they smack your bottom?

345
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,679
Not any more.

346
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,000
Domestic bliss is a pleasure I've been denied.

347
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,600
I'm childless and wifeless.

348
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,400
I have to rely on others for my creature comforts.

349
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,400
Free spirits, untamed by convention.

350
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,800
Jolly good sports, like Fred.

351
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,520
I feel you are such a kindred spirit, Ursula.

352
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,120
You have the power to make me the happiest of men.

353
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,600
At first the idea of my chastising you may seem abhorrent.

354
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,759
That is merely through association.

355
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,359
When you see the delight it affords me...

356
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,000
..you'll see it, not as a violation, but an act of love.

357
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,159
I'll awaken in you a world of sensuality.

358
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,959
You'll not find my gratitude ungenerous.

359
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,800
The pain is nothing, passes in a moment. And the marks soon fade.

360
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,200
But should I draw blood you'll feel the salt of my tears in your wounds.

361
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,320
I believe you mentioned a fee.

362
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,240
Get out!

363
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,359
How dare you lead me on, you money-grabbing bitch?!

364
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,159
You disgusting little trollop!

365
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,200
Get out!

366
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,759
Ha!

367
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,600
Halt!

368
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,920
Quite commendable. You have the skill, but you lack the desire to win.

369
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,800
Yes, miss. Thank you.

370
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,680
And desire, girls, is the source of all truth and good.

371
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,880
Class dismissed.

372
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,680
There'll be no instruction next week owing to exams, so good luck.

373
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:52,800
Thank you, miss.

374
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,800
So, you got picked on today.

375
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,359
Ursula, I'm sorry about Mack. I should have thought it through.

376
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,160
It was...

377
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:07,359
An act of love, perhaps.

378
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,159
In a way.

379
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,600
There are things one should understand about life, even artists.

380
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,280
It's best to be prepared.

381
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:20,380
Who prepared me for that?

382
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:21,800
Experience is the best teacher.

383
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,800
I was half expecting you last weekend.

384
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,600
I was studying.

385
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,759
What are you doing in the holidays?

386
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,559
Uncle Henry's invited me to Grange Hall. I said I'd bring you.

387
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,200
You will come, won't you?

388
00:32:58,381 --> 00:32:59,400
Out the way!

389
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,159
Nearly late for his own funeral.

390
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,280
Has there been a death in the family?

391
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,000
No, miss, it were only a miner.

392
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,999
A miner?

393
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,959
He leaves a wife and two bairns.

394
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,159
Was it an accident?

395
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,959
Consumption.

396
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,759
It gets them sooner or later. He died gradually - fretful.

397
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,559
My father went the same. It's a relief when it's over.

398
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,359
Gruesome.

399
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,840
And the widow?

400
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,600
She'll be getting married again directly.

401
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,839
Her two sisters have just changed husbands.

402
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,679
Is Uncle Henry going to the funeral?

403
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,000
No, miss, but he'll send biggest wreath.

404
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,000
Ah! There you are!

405
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,600
About time, too. You missed Anton, I'm afraid. He was disappointed.

406
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,000
Never mind. I'm pleased your friend could manage it.

407
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,760
Hello.

408
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,359
I'm Henry Brangwen.

409
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,680
Hello.

410
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:15,400
Welcome to Grange Hall.

411
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,400
Thank you.

412
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,800
I'm so glad that...

413
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,159
I'm sorry. You're upset?

414
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,959
No.

415
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,559
She saw your wreath and burst into tears at the thought of that miner.

416
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,660
I did no such thing, I've a smut in my eye.

417
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,159
From one of your filthy pit chimneys.

418
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,759
Let me see. Williams should have had the top down, he's bone idle.

419
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,800
Just look up.

420
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,000
There!

421
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,600
Souvenir.

422
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,639
Why are the men so sad?

423
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,559
Are they?

424
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,160
They seem unutterably sad.

425
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,759
I wouldn't go as far as that.

426
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,800
They just take it all for granted. They accept their lot.

427
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,159
Why don't they alter it?

428
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,759
They alter themselves to fit the pits...

429
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,180
..rather than alter the pits to fit themselves.

430
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,200
It's easier.

431
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,999
You, of all people, agree...

432
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,600
..that human beings should adapt themselves to all kinds of horrors?!

433
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,080
We could easily do without the pits.

434
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,759
Until the wood ran out.

435
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,319
Perhaps their lives aren't so bad.

436
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,800
They are pretty bad. The pits are deep and hot, and in some places wet.

437
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,120
But they're paid good wages. They're sold to the pit.

438
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,200
And the women?

439
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,759
What do they get?

440
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,200
They get what's left.

441
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,180
How delightful to hear birds singing at night.

442
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,200
You will excuse me.

443
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,400
Good night!

444
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,880
Oh dear! What have I done now?

445
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,559
It's the canaries I breed for the pits.

446
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,439
The men take them down when they go to work.

447
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,359
How lovely.

448
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:06,359
When they stop singing, there's gas. One whiff and they're dead. The men have a minute.

449
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,399
Oh.

450
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,959
Ursula doesn't approve. They've saved many lives.

451
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,000
I get the impression that Ursula doesn't approve of you at all.

452
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,919
She loathes the fact that my pits support her family.

453
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,359
Perhaps I should go to her.

454
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,959
As you wish. I was about to retire myself.

455
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,160
Must be tiring working the pit.

456
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:34,759
The pits work themselves. It's my ankle - a strained tendon.

457
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,680
My doctor prescribes mustard baths.

458
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,879
Very anti-social.

459
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,119
I've heard of them prescribed for rheumatism, but not strains.

460
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,000
Really?

461
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,959
I'm a qualified osteopath.

462
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,879
Are you, now?

463
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,080
Would you like me to look at it?

464
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,940
Where?

465
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:56,960
Anywhere.

466
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,440
Here, if you like.

467
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,000
I don't know, they...

468
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,400
Are your servants.

469
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,959
They are rather limiting types.

470
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,759
Should they see my foot in your hand, they may...

471
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,400
May think I had a fetish.

472
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,000
Aye, they might.

473
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,359
It feels so strange - as if a kitten had swallowed a snake.

474
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,060
Give him to Jacobs before he has one of your fingers.

475
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,559
What's the object of this caper?

476
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,959
Tell her, Jacobs.

477
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,159
Aye, sir. To save our prize lettuce from the rabbits.

478
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,959
They make such lovely pets - lettuce.

479
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
Ursula, do grow up.

480
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,959
Well, there's another prize lettuce - saved.

481
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,000
Right. You shall have it for lunch.

482
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,359
I can see how this game amuses you.

483
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,159
It's like your pit, this warren. Your men haven't got a hope.

484
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,800
They certainly breed like them.

485
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,600
Catch them in a net, or they perish in the dark.

486
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,400
Either way they're doomed.

487
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,759
Ursula lacks the courage of her convictions.

488
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,960
Do you want to help me?

489
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:46,960
Yes, Daddy.

490
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:50,000
Help plant some taties if you like.

491
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,959
See these?

492
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,840
Hmm.

493
00:40:57,841 --> 00:41:00,159
These are the sprouts. They have to stand straight.

494
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,159
We've to put them so far apart, do you see?

495
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,800
You stay here, I'll go down there and we'll meet in the middle.

496
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,759
What are you doing?! You're tramping on them!

497
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,800
That's like you - following your stupid nose.

498
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,199
Ursula, dearest, what have I done?

499
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,079
Nothing.

500
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,240
Is it because of your Uncle Henry and me?

501
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:47,640
No... I'm glad.

502
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,119
He's invited me to stay on after you've gone.

503
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,119
But if you'd rather you and I went off somewhere...

504
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,960
No, I have to go home. I'm expecting my examination results.

505
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,640
You've nothing to worry about there.

506
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,080
You are fond of him, aren't you?

507
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:15,320
I've been fond of him ever since I was a child.

508
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,080
He's a man by himself. He has something apart from the rest.

509
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,359
Yes, I thought you'd get on.

510
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,320
I know you did.

511
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,559
"Love seeketh not itself to please."

512
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,599
But... Henry!

513
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,599
Why not Henry?

514
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,599
I'd like to destroy his colliery.

515
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,879
And put everyone out of work?

516
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,159
I'd rather they starve and grub the earth for roots.

517
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,200
And what about us poor women? Huh?

518
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,320
Yes, I'll stay.

519
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,800
It'll be best.

520
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,160
Now, tell me you love me.

521
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,960
Yes.

522
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,320
DAD!

523
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,160
DAD!

524
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,119
Dad, guess what!

525
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,440
Has Billy had too much birthday cake and disgraced himself?

526
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,799
Oh, Dad, please!

527
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,360
Does he like his tent?

528
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,519
Can't get him out of it. Dad, I passed my exams!

529
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,999
Hey! Well done, lass.

530
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,839
It came second post with a letter from my headmistress about a job.

531
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,879
A job?

532
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,119
Can't I go out to work?

533
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,439
Whatever for? You've enough to do helping your mother.

534
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,900
But I want some other kind of life!

535
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,399
What on earth do you mean by that?

536
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,440
We'll discuss it after us tea.

537
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,879

What's the matter? Billy, what have you done to Rupert?

541
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,319
Mother, do something with him.

542
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,120
Come here, let me show you...

543
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,439
Your turn next, Ursula. What would you like?

544
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,439
Get her a bicycle, Dad, please.

545
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,239
To be free to earn my own keep. That's what I'd like best.

546
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,559
How will you do that?

547
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,600
I can become a teacher. I'm qualified by my matric.

548
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,600
Aye.

549
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,279
How much are you qualified to earn by your matric?

550
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,520
£50 a year. It's not much, but it's enough to live on.

551
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,519
What kind of teacher will you make?

552
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,919
You've no patience with your own brothers and sisters.

553
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,280
Some people don't think so.

554
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:29,200
Oh?

555
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,200
My headmistress, for one.

556
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,519
"I deeply sympathise with your desire to do something."

557
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,840
"I shall be proud to see you win economic independence."

558
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,040
"It provides freedom of choice."

559
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,159
You did it behind our backs!

560
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,959
What do you mean?

561
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,320
School-leavers always have an interview with the headmistress.

562
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,999
"I see no reason why you shouldn't make a good teacher."

563
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,239
"After a year as an uncertified instructor, you could take a degree."

564
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,679
"That would give you the self-respect nothing else can."

565
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,760
She even sent an application form.

566
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,359
What's this about Kingston?

567
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:25,159
It's her old school. They've a vacancy. I can apply for an interview and have you sign it.

568
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,000
There's no way you're dancing off to London.

569
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,279
It's a good place to go.

570
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,780
How do you know?!

571
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:34,159
It's on the Thames, it's lovely.

572
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,799
You said, Mother, we have a right to what we want.

573
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,639
It's up to your father.

574
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,679
Why not get a post near here?

575
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,520
Something in town.

576
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,520
That slum!

577
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,320
I'd rather go right away. I'm fed up with housework.

578
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,879
Indeed?! You have too much opinion of yourself.

579
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,639
There's a place for me and I want to go.

580
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,020
You're not going.

581
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:03,680
Why not?!

582
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,680
That's why not!

583
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:17,440
London's full of troops off to South Africa - no place for a girl.

584
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,519
We'll see the local authorities about a place here.

585
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:28,160
You can put me off, but one day I'll get a place and I won't stop at home.

586
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,360
NOBODY WANTS YOU TO STOP AT HOME!

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,360
Isn't it a nasty morning?

591
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,160
Yes, not much of weather.

592
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,600
Am I early?

593
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,480
Twenty-five past - you're second to come. I'm first this morning.

594
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,160
Must you do so many?

595
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,919
Fifty-six.

596
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,460
But they're not all for your class.

597
00:49:58,461 --> 00:49:59,880
Why aren't they?

598
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,879
It's too many.

599
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,279
You've got about the same.

600
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,240
That'll be Miss Hardy, Headmaster's assistant.

601
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,680
Oh! You are early.

602
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,280
I'll warrant you don't keep that up.

603
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,320
That...is Mr Harvey's peg.

604
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,560
This...is yours.

605
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,279
Aren't you taking your hat off?

606
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,880
Standard Five teacher always has that one.

607
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,820
Isn't it a beastly morning?

608
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,479
Beastly!

609
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,079
If there's one thing I hate it's a wet Monday morning...

610
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,159
..kids trailing in anyhow.

611
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,880
This...belongs over there.

612
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,800
You've brought your apron, haven't you?

613
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,279
You've no idea what a sight you'll look before half past four.

614
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,120
Jim Richards! What are you doing, peering in? Come here!

615
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,959
I want you to go and askmyma for a pinny for Miss Brangwen.

616
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,799
Yes, miss.

617
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,679
What are you going for? And what shall you say to my ma?

618
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,919
School pinny, miss.

619
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:45,360
"Please, Mrs Harby, Miss Harby says to send down another pinafore for Miss Brangwen...

620
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,199
..because she's come without one."

621
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,639
Yes, miss.

622
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,160
What are you going to say?!

623
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,119
Miss Harby wants a pinny for Miss Brangwin.

624
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,360
Miss BrangWEN. Be quick about it.

625
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,800
He's a caution, that boy - but not bad. Follow me!

626
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:18,000
Here we are. Standards Three, Four, Five and Six.

627
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,999
This is your place - Standard Five.

628
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,200
Mr Harvey will be teaching through there.

629
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,440
He'll be keeping an eye on you.

630
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,560
If you can find your way back to the teachers' room he'll be there.

631
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,519
You had a wet walk.

632
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,640
I don't mind. I'm used to it.

633
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,400
You will sign your name here.

634
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,359
And the time when you come and go.

635
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,079
Miss Brangwen, there are some exercise books on the top shelf.

636
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,520
Get them, would you ?

637
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,680
I'm so sorry.

638
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,200
I'd let them in now.

639
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,000
Miss Brangwen, you will go to the lobby with Mr Brunt.

640
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,520
Door!

641
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,280

00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,840

Class Five, quick march.

649
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,000
HALT!

650
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,440
Who told Standard Five to come in first like this?

651
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,680
I am responsible, Mr Harby.

652
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,720
This is Miss Brangwen, replacement teacher for Standard Five.

653
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,680
For her benefit we'll start again.

654
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,800
Describe the modern factory and the assembly of a given product.

655
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,280
I will expect you...

656
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,680
We will start with a composition.

657
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,159
Write me a short essay on...

658
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,119
..the rabbit.

659
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,039
Miss, I got the pinny.

660
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,359
Thank you. Timmy, isn't it?

661
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,780
No, miss, it's Jim.

662
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm sorry. Thank you.

663
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,840
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?!

664
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,959
Yes, Richards?

665
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,999
Sir, Miss forgot her pinny, and Miss Harby sent me for one of hers.

666
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,079
I put it in my satchel so it wouldn't get rained on...

667
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,300
..and there were chalk in it. I forgot, sir.

668
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:47,600
Spell the word "pinafore".

669
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,079
P-I-N-A-F-O-U-R

670
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,680
You will write "pinafore" 100 times on the blackboard after school.

671
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:05,879
Miss Brangwen will supervise you. This time she will supply the chalk.

672
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,120
Silence. Resume your studies.

673
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,600
I will examine your efforts in the morning.

674
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,439
Isn't it done?

675
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,239
Not yet.

676
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,960
I didn't know we had a stove. Must be jolly bringing lunch.

677
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:01,039
On the other hand, if one lived here it would be jollier to go home.

678
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,519
Miss Brangwen, if I were you I'd get a tighter hand on my class.

679
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,720
Would you? Aren't I strict enough?

680
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,719
They'll get you down if you don't tackle them.

681
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,719
They'll pull you down till Harby has you shifted.

682
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,359
You won't last a month if you don't tackle them.

683
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,420
But I...

684
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,599
He's got his eye on you.

685
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,840
Get in his bad books and you'll be out.

686
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,640
Not that it matters to me, except I might have to cope with your class.

687
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,839
Will it be so terrible?

688
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,440
I don't know about terrible.

689
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,280
I do feel frightened. The children seem so...

690
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,680
So...what?

691
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,159
Mr Brunt says I must tackle my class.

692
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,519
You have to keep order to teach.

693
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,000
If you want to survive.

694
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,279
If you can't do that, what good are you?

695
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,199
You'll have to do it by yourself.

696
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,240
Indeed.

697
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,319
Some people can't be helped.

698
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,679
Do you think there will be a war?

699
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,560
More like a bloody massacre in your case.

700
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:25,359
When you say "Their fur is brown", how do you spell "their"?

701
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,079
Please, miss - T-H-E-I-R!

702
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,119
Richards. Stand up.

703
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,359
Who told you to call out?

704
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,380
I was answering, sir.

705
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,400
Go to my desk.

706
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,720
Pens down.

707
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,359
Fold arms.

708
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,240
What is the subject of your composition?

709
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,400
I wouldn't advise you to call out.

710
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,479
Well, Alice?

711
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,399
The rabbit, sir.

712
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:00,360
Not very difficult for Standard Five. Or very original.

713
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:08,760
Don't nibble your lip. You've written about rabbits so often you're turning into one.

714
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,980
That'll do, Richards, you can go.

715
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:49,439
But the master said 100 times.

716
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,439
I know, but you may go home now.

717
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,480
I said go home.

718
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,120
OW!

719
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,720
I cut my finger on a nail.

720
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,719
Where was that?

721
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,239
Erm...on my desk.

722
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,660
Show me, I'll take care of it.

723
01:02:53,661 --> 01:02:55,320
Yes, thank you, I will tomorrow.

724
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:05,440
That Richards, Miss Brangwen, you've made a rod for your own back.

725
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,439
You're very young and inexperienced.

726
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,279
Hardly out of school yourself.

727
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,079
I could be very useful to you, Miss Brangwen.

728
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,839
I could make it easier for you.

729
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,880
So much easier. If only you'd...

730
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,800
I could swallow you whole.

731
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:33,920
You see, Miss Brangwen, only my cane rules this school.

732
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,719
Hello, lass! How did it go?

733
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,439
Fine, Dad. It was a bit strange at first.

734
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:25,200
Bound to be. Hey, you just missed your Uncle Henry.

735
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,239
Oh?

736
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,040
Dropped in with a lady.

737
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,199
Oh?

738
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,359
Your old teacher.

739
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,520
Miss Inger?

740
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,000
Aye. Seems they're getting married.

741
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,879
And guess what.

742
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,199
They want you to be chief bridesmaid.

743
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:03,240
Relations, neighbours, friends, lift up your glasses and drink to the hearth and the home.

744
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,479
The hearth, the home, and may they enjoy them.

745
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,359
The hearth, the home!

746
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,879
Night and day and may they enjoy it.

747
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,319
Night and day!

748
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:18,160
Hammer and tongs, and may they enjoy them.

749
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:19,359
Hammer and tongs!

750
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,400
Bed and blessings, and may they enjoy them.

751
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:25,040
Bed and blessings!

752
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,040
Marriage... Marriage...

753
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:32,639
Marriage is...

754
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:35,519
It's what we're made for.

755
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,159
A man enjoys being a man.

756
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,040
For what purpose was he made a man if not to enjoy it?

757
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,359
And likewise a woman enjoys being a woman.

758
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,240
Least in my eyes she does.

759
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,920
Now, for a man to be a man it takes a woman...

760
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:01,720
..and for a woman to be a woman it takes a man.

761
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,519
And therefore we have marriage.

762
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,120
Don't run us off our legs.

763
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,919
There is no marriage in heaven, but on earth there is.

764
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,680
If there are no marriages in heaven, where do the angels come from?

765
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,999
Angels... If there's got to be angels...

766
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,879
There's got to be, hasn't there?

767
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:33,279
If there's got to be angels, and there are no men or women amongst them...

768
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,920
..it seems to me as a married couple makes one angel.

769
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,800
It's the drink!

770
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,960
Go on.

771
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,240
An angel has got to be more than a human being.

772
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:57,360
So I say an angel is the soul of a man and a woman in one.

773
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,519
And, and, and...!

774
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,920
No, wait! They rise up, united in the Judgement Day, as one angel.

775
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,439
Aye!

776
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,639
I had an angel up my nose once.

777
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,639
My mother said, "Why are you poking about up there?"

778
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,720
I said, "I've got an angel up my nose." She gave me such a swipe.

779
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,800
We called dandelion seeds "angels" and I'd stuffed one up my nose.

780
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,479
If I become an angel, it'll be my married soul, not my single soul.

781
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,479
So I say...an angel is the soul of a man and a woman...

782
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,320
..in one.

783
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,399
How lovely.

784
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,640
Praise the Lord.

785
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,880
Praise the Lord!

786
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,960
Praise the Lord!

787
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,280
Isn't it nice to have a wedding?

788
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:16,759
You have confetti in your hair.

789
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,079
I hear you're teaching.

790
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,240
Yes. I thought you might have gone off to war.

791
01:08:23,241 --> 01:08:24,840
I embark at Southampton on Friday.

792
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,719
Do you want to go?

793
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,920
I want to go, yes.

794
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:34,839
Ladies and gentlemen, take your partners for the Lancers, please.

795
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,199
Why do you want to go to war?

796
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:46,719
To do something genuine. It's a toy life, as it is.

797
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,279
What'll you be doing?

798
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,559
Making railways, building bridges, working like a slave.

799
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,079
But they'll be pulled down when the Army's done with them.

800
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,319
It's like a game.

801
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,119
Not to those taking part.

802
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,360
It's about the most serious business there is, fighting.

803
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:11,719
Why is fighting more serious than teaching, for instance?

804
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:16,199
You kill or get killed. It's serious enough, killing.

805
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,960
When you're dead you don't matter.

806
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:21,799
But it matters whether we settle the Boers.

807
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,799
Not to you or me. Do you want to live in Africa?

808
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,839
No, but we have to do this or it's the end of the nation.

809
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,639
But we aren't the nation. Heaps of others are.

810
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,839
Everybody could say that.

811
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,599
If everybody said it, there'd be no nation, but I should be myself.

812
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,460
You'd be at the mercy of every robber that came along.

813
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:45,840
They wouldn't get much.

814
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,920
I'd rather be swept off my feet by a robber than a soldier.

815
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,720
Only because you can't imagine me out of uniform.

816
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,840
Will this do?

817
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,359
Now may I steal your heart?

818
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,920
It's not my heart you want but my soul.

819
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,600
Kiss me.

820
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:00,000
Kiss me, Anton! Kiss me! Kiss me!

821
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,240
They see war as a game, anyway.

822
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,600
Bang!

823
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,600
Arghhhh!

824
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,439
Anton?

825
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,279
What?

826
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,279
Come back to me.

827
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,159
Yes.

828
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,800
You will come back to me?

829
01:14:15,801 --> 01:14:16,880
I will come back.

830
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,080
I'm going to dance with Anton.

831
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,280
May I take the soldier?

832
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,199
Ursula's looking a bit upset.

833
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,040
Oh?

834
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,360
Ask her to dance.

835
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,480
Go and ask her. Go and ask her now.

836
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:08,720
As father of the chief bridesmaid, may I have the pleasure?

837
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,880
Such a condition in a class.

838
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,880
I don't believe it. Simply disgraceful.

839
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,359
I can't think how you've been allowed to get like it.

840
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,959
Every Monday I shall examine these books...

841
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:46,479
..so don't think you can unlearn everything you've learned...

842
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,359
..and go back to Standard Three.

843
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,439
Why are you writing in pencil?

844
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,480
There aren't enough pens to go round.

845
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,999
Not enough pens, Miss Brangwen?

846
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,160
No. We are five short.

847
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,440
Oh. And how is that?

848
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,399
How many are here today?

849
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,440
Twenty-four.

850
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,960
How many pens are there? Staples?

851
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,720
Please, sir, 19.

852
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,999
That's very curious. A few days ago there were 24 pens.

853
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,440
Now there are 19. What's 19 from 24, Richards?

854
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,279
Please, sir?

855
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,680
I'm waiting, Richards.

856
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,039
Eleven, sir.

857
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:40,519
I would advise you to attend. 19 from 24 is 5, so there are five pens to account for.

858
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,239
Have you looked for them, Staples?

859
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,320
Yes, sir.

860
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,839
Am I to have thieving, besides your dirt, bad work and bad behaviour?

861
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:58,040
Not content with being the worst class in the school, you are thieves as well.

862
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,520
Pens do not melt into the air, or mizzle away into nothing.

863
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,759
They must be somewhere and they must be found by Standard Five.

864
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,040
They were lost by Standard Five and they must be found!

865
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,360
No recreation until all pens are found.

866
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,280
Miss Brangwen will organise the search.

867
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:30,399
To start with, you will turn out your desks completely.

868
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,240
Not just your books, but conkers, string, sweets, everything.

869
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,439
Be quiet, Wesley. What is it?

870
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,359
Please, miss, Richards hit me.

871
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,719
Come in front, Richards.

872
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,319
I said come in front!

873
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,360
I SHAN'T!

874
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,080
Ah! Get off!

875
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,719
STAND STILL!

876
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,760
Fold your arms!

877
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,359
Get off me, you bitch!

878
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,200
OW!

879
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,720
OW!

880
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,080
Get off!

881
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,240
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!

882
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,880
I've thrashed him.

883
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,080
Get up! Go and stand by my desk!

884
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:06,159
If you settle Benson and Staples the same way, you'll be all right.

885
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,920
Put your things away tidily!

886
01:19:08,921 --> 01:19:09,920
Sharp! Sharp!

887
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,240
I said... put your things away tidily!

888
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:22,080
There will be no more time wasted looking for lost pens.

889
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:27,079
New pens will be issued first thing Monday morning.

890
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,000
Carry on!

891
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,639
What's he say?

892
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,679
You know perfectly well.

893
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,720
Since it's all about the weather, it must be in code.

894
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,319
There's a tatie pot in the oven for you.

895
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,160
Thanks, Mother.

896
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,559
Dad in church?

897
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,520
As usual.

898
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,799
Aren't you hungry?

899
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,279
Pay day!

900
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,320
You've been there a month already?

901
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,760
This is my board.

902
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,560
Fifty shillings.

903
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,680
Aye.

904
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,360
Come and get your dinner. Billy, bedtime.

905
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,879
That was the happiest day of her life.

906
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,879
A souvenir from the class bouquet?

907
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,039
A memento of her time at that prison.

908
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,079
I thought she enjoyed the challenge.

909
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,079
Nobody likes school.

910
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,240
You don't like your art school?

911
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,279
That's different.

912
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,759
Here's us at Scarborough in the holidays.

913
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,119
A few sunny days on parole.

914
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,679
Dad and I ran the handicrafts school.

915
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,920
Ursula spent her time at the harbour with the sailors.

916
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,839
No souvenirs of them?

917
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,439
Not here. There's plenty of you, though.

918
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,119
I've often wondered about this one. Who are those wretched folk?

919
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,319
The Boers. The enemy.

920
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:14,480
But they're civilians. And that woman - were you fighting women?

921
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,999
She had six notches in her rifle.

922
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,880
Why?

923
01:22:18,881 --> 01:22:20,120
Six notches - six lives.

924
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:24,680
Carlisle College with the suffragettes - and the teachers.

925
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,880
Another prison?

926
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,839
This is beautiful.

927
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,680
A cross section of human hair. Such delicate abstraction.

928
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,079
I prefer the coarse reality.

929
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,920
Gudrun!

930
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,120
Anton was just admiring...your hair.

931
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,000
She was only being polite.

932
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,559
We were waiting for you.

933
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,519
Yes. Exams started late.

934
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,519
How did you do?

935
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,279
Not very well. You shouldn't have encouraged her.

936
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,680
No. But I was all agog.

937
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,160
You've been very busy these last two years, haven't you?

938
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,720
Yes. So have you, I gather.

939
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,760
Yes.

940
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,079
I'm very happy to see you.

941
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,120
Thank you.

942
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,719
Is there anything you'd like to do?

943
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,919
Is there anything we can do?

944
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,600
There's nothing to do here.

945
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:41,600
Then let's walk.

946
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,640
By the river?

947
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:59,199
I was quite flattered by the space allocated to me in your scrapbook.

948
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,240
Soldiering is more important than teaching.

949
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,879
I'd hoped you'd forgotten that.

950
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,519
The number of times I've regretted that last evening.

951
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,399
It could have ended there and then.

952
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:21,559
No, you were right. I enjoyed that awful school because I had such high hopes for college.

953
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:28,159
I saw it as a kind of religious retreat, a temple dedicated to truth and learning.

954
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:33,079
In reality, it's just a factory where you learn to make money.

955
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,279
In the Army, we earn glory.

956
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,999
I read the casualty lists every week. It was horrible.

957
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,999
I knew I'd come back.

958
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,999
I went back to our church once. Everything was clean and orderly.

959
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,200
Seemed like a dream.

960
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,039
It's getting dark.

961
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,360
Shall I hold your hand?

962
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,479
I'm not afraid of the dark in England - it's soft and natural.

963
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,520
It's my medium. Especially when you are here.

964
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,559
The darkness, were you afraid of it in Africa?

965
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:16,199
Yes. The darkness there is filled with fear, like the smell of blood.

966
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,279
The blacks know it. They worship it.

967
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,680
The darkness. One almost likes it. The fear -...

968
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,920
..something sensual.

969
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,759
Did you think of me in the darkness?

970
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,759
You were at the back of everything.

971
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,160
I had to come back to you.

972
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,199
This is lovely.

973
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:33,519
The last time I was here it was under false pretences, too.

974
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,519
Another lover?

975
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,959
Yes!

976
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,380
Aren't I the first?

977
01:26:38,381 --> 01:26:39,879
First and last. No, it was Winifred.

978
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,679
Really?

979
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,479
She was my first great passion.

980
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,840
I'm sure she said above the front door. Here we are.

981
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,560
Welcome.

982
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:08,360
I'm glad you're not always naked or all the women'd fall in love with you

983
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,800
They do, regularly. I'm considered quite a catch.

984
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:18,040
Oh! Not a fish out of water, I hope, flapping about on the ground.

985
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,000
Oh, no, there's my colonel's daughter, for instance.

986
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,839
Scent?

987
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,999
Soap.

988
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,880
Soap!

989
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,420
Would you rather live in India or England when we're married?

990
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:23,919
India, by far. Nice of you to ask.

991
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:28,239
It was decided long ago, wasn't it? When I first kissed you.

992
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:33,039
You'll like India. There's a good social life, hunting, polo.

993
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,319
I'll teach you to ride.

994
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:41,879
Plenty of servants...who'll cook, bathe babies, keep you cool.

995
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,800
I'll teach little Hindus to write essays on the rabbit!

996
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:53,639
You wouldn't have to teach, you wouldn't have to do anything.

997
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:58,439
But I do want to teach, and I don't want to be with other people.

998
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:02,280
I want to be like this. Isn't this enough?

999
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,839
It's enough for now.

1000
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:08,439
Then let's have no more talk of marriage.

1001
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,519
Which means that I'm to get supper tomorrow?

1002
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,560
I'll keep you to that!

1003
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,679
Strawberries! Strawberries! Fresh ripe strawberries!

1004
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,879
Shush, you'll wake them.

1005
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,959
All this hollering and pounding.

1006
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,399
I expected them up at this hour.

1007
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,399
Woman, you have a fickle memory.

1008
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,839
Strawberries! Fresh ripe strawberries!

1009
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:46,640
What a bore!

1010
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:46,639
She's supposed to be chaperoning us. We're supposed to be her guests.

1011
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,180
Were you expecting her?

1012
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:50,199
Didn't I say?

1013
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:54,040
Lt Skrebensky, your staff sergeant here.

1014
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,479
Ursula! Anton! I wonder where they are.

1015
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,279
Maybe they've gone out.

1016
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,680
Don't be stupid, woman.

1017
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:16,320
Good morning, grocer. Kindly leave them on the doorstep and go away!

1018
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:22,520
Why have you got your bloomers round your neck?

1019
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,720
Anton's wearing my nightie!

1020
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,999
But do you love him?

1021
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,999
It isn't a question of love. I love him well enough.

1022
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,399
More than anyone else.

1023
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,399
And I shall never love anyone else the same again.

1024
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:50,999
What does it mean, love? It doesn't lead anywhere.

1025
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,519
It isn't supposed to lead anywhere. It's an end in itself.

1026
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,519
Then I could love a hundred men one after the other.

1027
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,759
Why should I end as Mrs Skrebensky, social wife?

1028
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:11,759
Why not love all the types I fancy, as Ursula Brangwen, spinster, school mistress?

1029
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,199
Then you don't love him.

1030
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:18,519
I tell you, I do. Quite as much, and perhaps more, than any of the others.

1031
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,220
But there are things that aren't in Anton that I'd love in other men.

1032
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:24,439
Like what?

1033
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:30,960
An understanding, a directness. A man who could let go - reckless and passionate.

1034
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,759
What is this fantastic fulfilment you're hankering after?

1035
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,200
Is it just other men? Hmm?

1036
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:43,000
If it is, you'd better marry Anton.

1037
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,959
The other thing can only end badly.

1038
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,320
So I'm to marry out of fear of myself?

1039
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,359
We're ready for you!

1040
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,880
Time for mixed doubles.

1041
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:02,999
I can see you on an elephant - amongst adoring natives.

1042
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,719
I shall be glad to leave England, it's so unspiritual.

1043
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,559
Leave the home of democracy?

1044
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:14,079
Democracy... is only for the degenerate races.

1045
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,940
Why is democracy unspiritual?

1046
01:32:17,941 --> 01:32:20,199
Because only the ugly and the greedy succeed.

1047
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,999
The people elect the government.

1048
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:30,239
But what are the people? Each of them has a money interest, and they choose those who have money.

1049
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,159
They rule in the name of money.

1050
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,999
To me democracy means equality.

1051
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,039
The equality of the wage packet is a democracy of dirt.

1052
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:43,800
Then you should give away your worldly goods.

1053
01:32:43,801 --> 01:32:45,360
Or join us filthy aristocrats!

1054
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,400
Up onto the pedestal!

1055
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:52,719
Revolutionaries and aristocrats don't mix.

1056
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,800
But she is an aristocrat - of the spirit.

1057
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,080
YES!

1058
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,399
Stay just as long as you like.

1059
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:08,640
As long as you don't want to play croquet at the hall!

1060
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,040
Bye!

1061
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:21,120
Marriage agrees with them.

1062
01:33:21,121 --> 01:33:22,519
Meaning they agree with each other.

1063
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,320
It's a little odd, though.

1064
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:27,120
Odd?

1065
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:27,119
Something unnatural about Winifred.

1066
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,820
Yes, she has two left feet.

1067
01:33:29,821 --> 01:33:30,839
I meant her tendencies.

1068
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,439
She should be in a freak show

1069
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:39,040
Your relationship isn't healthy. Just as well we're going to India.

1070
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:40,519
You say the Indians aren't healthy.

1071
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:43,560
We'll improve health standards.

1072
01:33:43,561 --> 01:33:45,080
I meant you might find them freakish.

1073
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,999
Ursula, you must come with me for your own good.

1074
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,839
You'll govern the Indians for their own good with your dead judgements.

1075
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:59,400
If they have to bow down to you, I do not. You're so self-righteous!

1076
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,639
Aren't you righteous, in your own mind?

1077
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:09,199
Yes! But at least I am something. There's nobody there where you are.

1078
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:12,960
Are you anybody, with your old dead things?

1079
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,959
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1080
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,120
Yes, you did.

1081
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:30,080
The words came out without my knowing.

1082
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,200
They didn't mean anything really.

1083
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,799
You're a romantic, up on some hill...

1084
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,999
..so you'll always be looking down, always disappointed.

1085
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,040
Why must I climb that hill, Anton? Why not stay below?

1086
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:57,799
Why force one's way up, step after step, for a moment of exhilaration at the top...

1087
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,879
..only to plunge into a dark valley?

1088
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,560
When shall we be married?

1089
01:35:04,561 --> 01:35:06,720
I don't know!

1090
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,719
Don't you want to be married?

1091
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,719
I don't think I do!

1092
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,519
You mean never, or not yet?

1093
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,560
I mean never.

1094
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:20,999
He may take you back. You'll have to wait for his reply to your letter.

1095
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,840
I was full of apologies for my perverse, selfish behaviour.

1096
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:31,160
The child will make a difference.

1097
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,800
That's what decided me.

1098
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:38,279
I must go to him, because it's his child and because...

1099
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,280
..he once loved me.

1100
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,480
Is that the only reason?

1101
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,839
Croquet!

1102
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,919
I thought about my mother, too.

1103
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:54,240
If it was enough for her to have her man and children, why not for me?

1104
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,239
Why do I punish those who love me? I should be grateful for them.

1105
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,999
Do your parents know?

1106
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,839
I couldn't tell them so soon after failing my degree.

1107
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,960
What if Anton says no?

1108
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:13,120
I'll live at home with the child and go back to teaching.

1109
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,479
You haven't even seen a midwife.

1110
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:22,720
What if Anton says yes, you go to India and you find you're not with child?

1111
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:31,680
You'll come straight back, that's what you'll do.

1112
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:37,680
A child binds you to a man as securely as if you were handcuffed.

1113
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,640
Aren't you and Henry...?

1114
01:36:40,641 --> 01:36:41,760
Very good companions.

1115
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,559
But remember, you will always be welcome here.

1116
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,080
Tea.

1117
01:36:54,081 --> 01:36:56,000
I won't stop.

1118
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,999
Henry'll be back soon.

1119
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,600
It's getting late. I'll get my things.

1120
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,639
♪ ..Gently down the stream

1121
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:31,239
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream

1122
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:35,559
♪ Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream... ♪

1123
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:28,159
Your mother said to let you lie in, but I had to see you were all right.

1124
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,120
Thanks, Dad.

1125
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,960
We wondered where you'd got to.

1126
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,600
No bike or anything.

1127
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,720
Me and your mother were worried.

1128
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,679
And er...then we saw the telegram had gone.

1129
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,520
Yes, I saw you'd opened it.

1130
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:57,880
The boy asked if there was a reply. Naturally your mother thought...

1131
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:03,360
No marriage, no bike, no wonder you were worried.

1132
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:10,360
The bike's in a ditch. Is that where you expected to find me?

1133
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:14,600
I can see there's nothing much wrong with you.

1134
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,919
You were quite feverish earlier.

1135
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,999
I caught a chill.

1136
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,360
I heard the party. Didn't want to be a wet blanket.

1137
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,560
Don't be so silly.

1138
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:33,359
Your mother took the children out. Anything I can get you?

1139
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:37,319
No thanks, Dad. I think I'll lie in for a while.

1140
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,159
Thanks for the tea.

1141
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,999
Aye.

1142
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,799
Goodbye, lass.

1143
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,840
Bye, Dad.

1144
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,519
Don't work too hard.

1145
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:52,840
I'm er... I'm in town today. Thought I'd drop in your old school.

1146
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:55,679
Whatever for?

1147
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:58,359
Well, now that you're...

1148
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:00,359
Now that you're...

1149
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,559
Now that I'm an old maid?

1150
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,599
Let me finish.

1151
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,799
Now you're not off to the other side of the world...

1152
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:10,599
Or even the other side of London.

1153
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:17,440
I was just going to say that... this has always been, and always will be, your home.

1154
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:28,720
Hey, look, there's a rainbow.

1155
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,239
