2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,400
This film contains some strong 
language & some scenes of a sexual nature.

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,320
LAUGHS

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,760
Ursula! >

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,800
Ursula!

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,400
Ursula, come back 'ere!

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,000
Ursula!

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,360
Ursula!

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,600
Come back 'ere! It's dangerous!

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,600
LAUGHS

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,600
Ursula! Wait for me! >

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,560
Who didn't come, then?! 
Was it you, Miss Puddleduck?

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,960
Were you off for a swim?

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,960
No.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,960
What is it, me lady?

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,960
I want that, Daddy.

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Can't have it, it's not for catching

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,800
Want it!

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,800
It's too far off, lass. If you're a 
good girl I'll make you one for tea.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,440
They were naughty to fight. Losing 
their feathers. They'll be sorry when it's cold.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,600
I just saved this one from the river

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,200
Off you get.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,560
Perhaps we'll have that gate fixed.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
You left the door open!

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,760
What if I did?! The baker came 
and the baby woke up.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Why do you niggle me?! I don't just 
sit around designing lace hankies.

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,560
Soup again? You spoil me.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,160
Oh, is our little blackbird tuning up? 
Sing up, lad, and drown your mother out.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,560
You put such pressure in my head.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Oh, get off!

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,000
# When the pie was opened 
The birds began to sing

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,200
# Wasn't that a dainty dish... #

33
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Still there, Daddy. Can't I have it?

34
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,760
You're a persistent little 
madam. I'd not forgotten.

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,160
There you are. On you jump.

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,120
There we go. What about that, then?

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
Want a taste?

38
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,960
Uh-uh.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,960
A little taste. Just a little one. No?

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Uh.

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Oh, I see. You want the real one.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,800
Well, you can't have it, my lass.

43
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,000
"And again, I say unto you, it is easier 
for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle... >

44
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,200
..than for a rich man to enter 
the kingdom of God." >

45
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,960
The collection is for Mrs Hartley...

46
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,960
..widowed by the Grange Pit tragedy. 
I know you will give generously.

47
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,960
On a happier note, there will 
be a resumption of christenings.

48
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,600
Thanks to the restoration of the font 
by our organist - Will Brangwen.

49
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,400
PLAYS ORGAN

50
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
He's like my dolly.

51
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,320
This church takes up too much time, 
but it's a fine hand you've carved.

52
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,360
It's an ogre's hand.

53
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,360
It's the hand of God, Billy.

54
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,600
Assisting at the birth of Eve.

55
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,600
He's not a midwife!

56
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,760
It was my hand you used as a model.

57
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,800
That's not so, it's after Donatello's "Frances".

58
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,800
Perhaps that's how it started.

59
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,800
Oh, never!

60
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,360
For all you know, Donatello may have used his wife as a model.

61
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,360
Don't be ridiculous. The hand of God is a man's hand.

62
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Like taking Eve out of Adam's body, when man is born of woman? The impudence of men!

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Oh, Mother, don't fuss so!

64
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,160
I have said, Ursula, do not speak to me like that.

65
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,160
How could a great big camel pass through an eye of a needle?

66
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,000
With great difficulty, I'd think.

67
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,600
RUNNING FOOTSTEPS

68
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,400
It's locked. Open the door, Ursula. >

69
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,560
She won't answer, she's dead. >

70
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,760
Go away. I'm not dead. What do you want?

71
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Mother says you have to come down to dinner. >

72
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,200
There's a soldier downstairs with Uncle Henry. >

73
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,000
DOOR HANDLE RATTLES

74
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:24,200
You're not fibbing, are you?! Cos I'll pull your hair out. Even if it is Sunday.

75
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,960
< I always used to ask strangers to stay.

76
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,760
It was rather trying for my parents.

77
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,960
It's our Lazarus. And Billy said you were dead.

78
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,960
Might as well be sometimes.

79
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,960
LAUGHTER

80
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:52,200
I wanted some peace. I didn't realise you were coming.

81
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,200
Or she'd have had a sherry.

82
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,200
Likes a tipple, does she? >

83
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,760
Give your Uncle Henry a kiss.

84
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,360
Drink the health of my friend - Lt Anton Skrebensky.

85
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,160
He's staying at the hall. His father was the parish priest.

86
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Are you staying long?

87
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
This is my last day.

88
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,760
I have to report back tomorrow.

89
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,960
To what do you report?

90
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm in the Engineers. And you? I suppose you're at school.

91
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,760
My last term. I'm taking my matriculation exams soon.

92
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,160
You'll be going out to work?

93
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,160
Don't put ideas in her head. My daughters don't need to work.

94
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm considering my field of action.

95
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,680
There's stockings need mending. They could be your field of action.

96
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
What would you like to be?

97
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
I don't know. A teacher, perhaps.

98
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,160
I could never study. The brains of the Army are in the Engineers.

99
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,960
I joined to get the credit of other people's brains.

100
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,160
Brains don't matter.

101
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,240
What does matter, then?

102
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,880
Whether people have courage or not.

103
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,880
Courage for what?

104
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,160
For everything.

105
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,160
Like a soldier, you mean?

106
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,160
That's another field of action you wouldn't like.

107
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,160
She should join the Royal Engineers.

108
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,600
No need for courage to build a privvy.

109
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Are you not lonely, being an orphan?

110
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,400
I have got a guardian. And Henry. And my aunts.

111
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm really fond of them all. But my real home is the Army.

112
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Do you like being on your own?

113
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,000
I think so.

114
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
I went to school early.

115
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,800
The outside world was more of a home to me than the vicarage.

116
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,800
This house used to be a vicarage.

117
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,000
Really?

118
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,600
Do you not feel like...

119
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,880
..like a bird, flown out of its own latitude?

120
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,880
CHUCKLES

121
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,400
I find things much as I like them.

122
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,000
You look very lazy.

123
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,000
I am lazy.

124
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,360
You look really floppy.

125
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I am floppy.

126
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,960
Can't you stop?

127
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,960
I don't want to stop.

128
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,000
It looks like there isn't a bone in your body.

129
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,000
That's how I like to feel.

130
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,360
I don't admire your taste.

131
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,560
That's my misfortune.

132
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,920
Damn it! Why can't I rock?!

133
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,400
Men don't rock themselves.

134
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,400
Girls don't pull men's hair.

135
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,400
You've seen that they do.

136
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,000
My father used to rock me on the swingboats.

137
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,400
Would you like to go on one again?

138
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,400
Oh, I didn't mean...

139
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,360
When?

140
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,360
Now! >

141
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,400
You arrange it with mother while I change.

142
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,040
Our families go a long way back.

143
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,040
My grandmother told me stories of her life in Poland.

144
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,440
She knew your father in Warsaw.

145
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,520
She married his friend, Dr Lensky, just before the uprising. They fought together.

146
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,560
Dr Lensky and Baron Skrebensky. Don't you find Polish names extremely musical?

147
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,560
They're a musical nation. And very patriotic. They make poor exiles.

148
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,400
They all die young, humming Chopin's "Funeral March".

149
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,360
You Lenskys seem to be an exception.

150
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,360
They say Granddad died with a stethoscope on.

151
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,960
He had connections with the medical profession and had a practice in Beldover. That's where Mum was born.

152
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,560
I've always thought it romantic to have Polish blood.

153
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,160
More than British? Is your father not romantic?

154
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,360
Of course, or he wouldn't have swept Mum off her feet.

155
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,760
They were married in that church. Shall we go in?

156
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,200
Oh, dear. I thought I'd escaped church parade today.

157
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,000
Come along.

158
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,360
­ Beg pardon, sir, didn't hear you.

159
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
This is dreadful.

160
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,560
Dreadful and wonderful.

161
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,000
Then let's stay a minute.

162
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:37,200
You loved flying high, didn't you?

163
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,200
Better than being earthbound. You'd think so if you lived in our house.

164
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,360
This reminds me of Ingram from my platoon.

165
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,360
Why's that?

166
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,360
He had a girl in Rochester. They'd make love in the cathedral.

167
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
How nice.

168
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,440
Ended badly. The verger caught them, got their names, made a row about it

169
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,160
What a shame. He shouldn't have objected.

170
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
He said it was a profanity.

171
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,800
No, I think it's right.

172
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,400
To make love in the house of God.

173
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,800
I promised your mother I'd have you home early, you've school tomorrow.

174
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,400
Come along, I'll buy you a lolly.

175
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,760
Push and glide! Push and glide!

176
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Ethel, as the arms complete their stroke, bend the legs back.

177
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,360
Don't let your feet break water.

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,600
Push and glide! Heads steady. All right.

179
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,600
WHISTLE

180
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,000
WHISTLE

181
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,000
Come on, I'll race you.

182
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,760
I've won. But you've good form. What's your name?

183
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,800
Ursula, Miss Inger. Ursula Brangwen.

184
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,200
Right, Ursula Brangwen.

185
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,920
Class dismissed. No lingering in the cubicles - Class Three are due.

186
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:21,760
Do you think it's wicked to let a man kiss you - a man you've just met?

187
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,760
I should think. It depends.

188
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,000
Real kisses, I mean. Not just flirting. He's a soldier.

189
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,760
Where did he kiss you?

190
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,800
In church.

191
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,960
I see. And what time was it?

192
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,200
Erm. About a quarter to seven.

193
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,800
Oh, yes, I think it'd be very wrong.

194
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,200
What do you think of the new athletics mistress?

195
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,200
Not a lot. She was rough with me.

196
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,800
Ursula. Ursula.

197
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,400
I enjoyed our race, did you?

198
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,400
Erm, yes. Yes, I did.

199
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,160
Tell me, have you a bicycle?

200
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
No. Er, yes.

201
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,800
My sister does, we share it.

202
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:25,000
Would you like to come for a swim on Saturday? I've a cottage on the river, you could stay for tea.

203
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,000
Thank you. Yes, I'd like that.

204
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
Come along, Class Three. Come on, girls. Come along.

205
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,400
Into the water. You'll be swimming like dolphins in no time.

206
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,200
NO, YOU CAN'T! I NEED IT! LISTEN TO ME!

207
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,800
STOP, WILL YA?! I SAID NO!

208
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,400
Stop! Oh, I hate you.

209
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,960
Mmm! Such peace.

210
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,160
Be more comfortable with your boots off. Here.

211
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,160
How do you spend your weekends?

212
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,160
Helping Mother. Going to church.

213
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,760
Church is peaceful.

214
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,760
GIGGLES

215
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
< Why do you laugh?

216
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
The last time it was anything but!

217
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,800
I was with a friend looking for seclusion.

218
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,040
Choir practice?

219
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,600
Restoration.

220
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Do you think it's blasphemous to make love in church?

221
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,600
No. Merely uncomfortable.

222
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,200
Such narrow pews.

223
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,320
Or did you do it standing up in a confessional?

224
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,320
We were only kissing.

225
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,560
Oh, I thought you meant fucking. Who was he?

226
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,600
A soldier.

227
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,360
What's the matter?

228
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,360
My father was a soldier. Coarse brute.

229
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,200
Treated my mother little better than a whore.

230
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,200
How do you mean?

231
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,560
As a person in her own right my mother did not exist.

232
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,560
She was an instrument for his perverted sexuality.

233
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,000
Was there no love?

234
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,600
The best you'll ever get from a man is passion.

235
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,960
Even that can't last.

236
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,760
I think we're in for a storm - the milk's turned.

237
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,960
Perhaps I should be off.

238
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't say that, not before our swim.

239
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,000
In the rush I forgot my costume. Besides, it looks like rain.

240
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,160
In the water what do raindrops matter?

241
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Besides, it's best in the rain.

242
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,240
It's safe, the grounds are private.

243
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,600
We'll undress inside and run down. It's all right.

244
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,800
DISTANT THUNDER

245
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,400
BOTH LAUGH

246
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,600
Come on.

247
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,800
You're tickling me!

248
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,800
Relax! You're in the hands of a qualified osteopath.

249
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,600
That's lovely.

250
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,160
I think you better go soon, it's getting late.

251
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,160
Can I not stay with you?

252
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Your parents wouldn't approve.

253
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,960
When will we see each other again?

254
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Monday, silly.

255
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,000
Swimming class.

256
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,600
I meant like this.

257
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,960
I was thinking of taking a school party to the Lakes next weekend. Want to come?

258
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,560
I'm not that fond of hiking.

259
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,800
I wouldn't bother, then.

260
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,000
I meant a party of one.

261
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,440
I love hiking!

262
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,280
Your mother'll think you've been kidnapped. Come along.

263
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,600
You heard me. I need it to get the groceries.

264
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,400
I had to carry them home. What have you got to say?

265
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,800
Damn the groceries! I'm sick of being told what to do.

266
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,400
- ALL:
- # We're bading in the sea, Mother

267
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,760
# We're bading in the sea, Mother... #

268
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,440
And I am standing here with your nightshirt.

269
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,600
# We're bading in the sea, Mother... #

270
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,600
Come on, Rupert, get up now.

271
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Will somebody love me, Mother?

272
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,360
We say "bathing", not bading. We all love you.

273
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,000
But will somebody love me ?

274
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,760
Some man will love you, because that's your nature.

275
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:18,000
I hope he loves you for what you are, not what he wants of you.

276
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,000
What did you want for yourself?

277
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,000
What I've got.

278
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Billy, where is your nightshirt?

279
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,560
I don't know.

280
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Then look for it!

281
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Marie pulled my hair.

282
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh, you two, get along.

283
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,360
We have a right to what we want.

284
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,760
Now then! What you up to?

285
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,680
Nothing.

286
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,680
Yes you are, you wicked lad. Up you get, plenty of room.

287
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,560
Why aren't they in bed?!

288
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,560
The children must live.

289
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,760
But I must live, too.

290
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
We all live together, lass.

291
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,600
My teacher's taking a party to the Lakes next weekend.

292
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,600
You're Uncle Henry's invited us to the hall on Saturday.

293
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,600
Anton'll be there.

294
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,000
I think not. I really must go with my school.

295
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Your mother's right.

296
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,160
Men have fixed ideas of what a woman should be.

297
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,960
Any woman who fits their definition, they say they love her.

298
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,960
They're only in love with themselves.

299
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,560
Like a serpent who swallows his tail when he's hungry.

300
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,400
But women - they have fixed ideas, too.

301
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,200
Can you see it? Can you make out what it is?

302
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,160
No.

303
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Can't you?

304
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,200
Up there, on the summit. The lion lays down with the lamb.

305
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,000
Can you see it now?

306
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,000
Yes! It's good, isn't it?

307
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,600
Can we get up there?

308
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,600
Let's have a drink before we tackle it.

309
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,800
Wave to the ladies.

310
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,800
Hello!

311
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,360
How I love lions.

312
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,760
God is like a lion to me.

313
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,360
Not like those silly toy lambs in church.

314
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Lambs or lions.

315
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,400
Buddha or Apollo. Christ or Zeus.

316
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,200
They're only symbols of man's instinctual desires - illusions.

317
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,800
Who do you worship?

318
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,200
I worship this.

319
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,560
GROWLS: I would like to be proud and strong like a lion.

320
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,800
Not weak like a lamb, who only exists to be loved and sacrificed.

321
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,200
To love and be loved are equally important.

322
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,400
When the lion lays down with the lamb in you, you'll know peace.

323
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,600
EXPLOSION

324
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,960
We're workin' the mine! Be off with you!

325
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Didn't you read the sign, woman! >

326
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,960
You are a monster. How dare you come here with your filthy mind?

327
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
EXPLOSION

328
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,000
Come on, Ursula!

329
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,200
Man is terrible. The works of man are more terrible still.

330
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,760
The mines are the most terrible of his works.

331
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,560
My Uncle Henry owns several of the Grange pits.

332
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,600
Really? Remember the painting at the cottage? It's Mack.

333
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,560
I sometimes model for the old rascal.

334
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,600
Mack! >

335
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,560
< We saw it so clearly from below. Where is it?

336
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:06,000
< Where d'ya think? Use your eyes.

337
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,000
If you're looking for a public convenience it's behind a rock.

338
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I'm looking for the lion and the lamb

339
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,200
It's behind you, silly.

340
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,600
It's an illusion - the lion laying down with the lamb.

341
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,400
You're the third person today to say that. Must be true.

342
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Distance lends enchantment. This is Ursula, one of our favourite sorts.

343
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,800
Is she now?

344
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,440
Do you always meet casually on mountains?

345
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,200
More often in the studio. Do you think she'd pose for me, Fred?

346
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,200
Would you like to, Ursula?

347
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,280
I don't know, I'm a bit of a fidget. When?

348
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,000
There'll be some pocket money in it for you. How's next Saturday?

349
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,800
I'll come along, if you like.

350
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,800
No, it's all right.

351
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm not a child.

352
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,400
I shall call it, "Experience Rewarding Innocence".

353
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,560
I generally choose titles with cynicism, but this is an exception.

354
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,800
I'd almost given up hope of finding purity in a girl your age.

355
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,360
Would you like me to smile?

356
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,360
It's not your face I'm painting at the moment.

357
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:34,160
You're a good girl, Ursula, are you not?

358
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,160
My parents don't always think so.

359
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,800
Parents seldom do.

360
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,960
Do they smack your bottom?

361
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,000
Not any more.

362
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,000
Domestic bliss is a pleasure I've been denied.

363
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm childless and wifeless.

364
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,400
I have to rely on others for my creature comforts.

365
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,400
Free spirits, untamed by convention.

366
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,800
Jolly good sports, like Fred.

367
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,520
I feel you are such a kindred spirit, Ursula.

368
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,120
< You have the power to make me the happiest of men.

369
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,600
At first the idea of my chastising you may seem abhorrent.

370
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,760
That is merely through association.

371
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,360
When you see the delight it affords me...

372
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,000
..you'll see it, not as a violation, but an act of love.

373
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,160
I'll awaken in you a world of sensuality.

374
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,960
You'll not find my gratitude ungenerous.

375
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,800
The pain is nothing, passes in a moment. And the marks soon fade.

376
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,200
But should I draw blood you'll feel the salt of my tears in your wounds.

377
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,320
I believe you mentioned a fee.

378
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,240
Get out!

379
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,360
< How dare you lead me on, you money-grabbing bitch?!

380
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,160
You disgusting little trollop!

381
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,200
Get out!

382
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,760
Ha!

383
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,600
Halt!

384
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,920
Quite commendable. You have the skill, but you lack the desire to win.

385
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,800
Yes, miss. Thank you.

386
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,680
And desire, girls, is the source of all truth and good.

387
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,880
Class dismissed.

388
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,800
There'll be no instruction next week owing to exams, so good luck.

389
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,800
- ALL:
- Thank you, miss.

390
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,800
So, you got picked on today.

391
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,360
Ursula, I'm sorry about Mack. I should have thought it through.

392
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,360
It was...

393
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,360
An act of love, perhaps.

394
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,160
In a way.

395
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,600
There are things one should understand about life, even artists.

396
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,800
It's best to be prepared.

397
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,800
Who prepared me for that?

398
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,800
Experience is the best teacher.

399
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,800
I was half expecting you last weekend.

400
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,600
I was studying.

401
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,760
What are you doing in the holidays?

402
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Uncle Henry's invited me to Grange Hall. I said I'd bring you.

403
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,200
You will come, won't you?

404
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,400
HORN

405
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,400
Out the way!

406
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:13,000
Nearly late for his own funeral.

407
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:13,000
Has there been a death in the family?

408
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,000
No, miss, it were only a miner.

409
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,000
A miner?

410
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,960
He leaves a wife and two bairns.

411
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Was it an accident?

412
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,960
Consumption.

413
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,760
It gets them sooner or later. He died gradually - fretful.

414
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,360
My father went the same. It's a relief when it's over.

415
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,360
Gruesome.

416
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,600
And the widow?

417
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,600
She'll be getting married again directly.

418
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,840
< Her two sisters have just changed husbands.

419
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,000
Is Uncle Henry going to the funeral?

420
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,000
No, miss, but he'll send biggest wreath.

421
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,000
Ah! There you are!

422
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,600
About time, too. You missed Anton, I'm afraid. He was disappointed.

423
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,000
Never mind. I'm pleased your friend could manage it.

424
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,760
Hello.

425
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,400
I'm Henry Brangwen.

426
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,400
Hello.

427
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,400
Welcome to Grange Hall.

428
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,400
Thank you.

429
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm so glad that...

430
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I'm sorry. You're upset?

431
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,960
No.

432
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,560
She saw your wreath and burst into tears at the thought of that miner.

433
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,160
I did no such thing, I've a smut in my eye.

434
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,160
From one of your filthy pit chimneys.

435
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,760
Let me see. Williams should have had the top down, he's bone idle.

436
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,800
Just look up.

437
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,000
There!

438
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,600
Souvenir.

439
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:24,160
Why are the men so sad?

440
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,160
Are they?

441
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,160
They seem unutterably sad.

442
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:31,800
I wouldn't go as far as that.

443
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,800
They just take it all for granted. They accept their lot.

444
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,760
Why don't they alter it?

445
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,760
They alter themselves to fit the pits...

446
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,200
..rather than alter the pits to fit themselves.

447
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,200
It's easier.

448
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,000
You, of all people, agree...

449
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,600
..that human beings should adapt themselves to all kinds of horrors?!

450
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,080
We could easily do without the pits.

451
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,760
Until the wood ran out.

452
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,320
Perhaps their lives aren't so bad.

453
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,800
They are pretty bad. The pits are deep and hot, and in some places wet.

454
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,120
But they're paid good wages. They're sold to the pit.

455
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,200
And the women?

456
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,760
What do they get?

457
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,200
They get what's left.

458
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,520
BIRDSONG

459
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,200
How delightful to hear birds singing at night.

460
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,200
COUGHS

461
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,200
You will excuse me.

462
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,400
Good night!

463
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,880
Oh dear! What have I done now?

464
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,560
It's the canaries I breed for the pits.

465
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,360
The men take them down when they go to work.

466
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,360
How lovely.

467
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:11,360
When they stop singing, there's gas. One whiff and they're dead. The men have a minute.

468
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,960
Oh.

469
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,960
Ursula doesn't approve. They've saved many lives.

470
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,000
I get the impression that Ursula doesn't approve of you at all.

471
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:29,360
She loathes the fact that my pits support her family.

472
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,360
Perhaps I should go to her.

473
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,960
As you wish. I was about to retire myself.

474
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,760
Must be tiring working the pit.

475
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,760
The pits work themselves. It's my ankle - a strained tendon.

476
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,680
My doctor prescribes mustard baths.

477
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:50,000
Very anti-social.

478
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,000
I've heard of them prescribed for rheumatism, but not strains.

479
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,000
Really?

480
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:58,080
I'm a qualified osteopath.

481
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,080
Are you, now?

482
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,080
Would you like me to look at it?

483
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Where?

484
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,960
Anywhere.

485
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,440
Here, if you like.

486
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't know, they...

487
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,400
Are your servants.

488
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,960
They are rather limiting types.

489
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,760
Should they see my foot in your hand, they may...

490
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,400
May think I had a fetish.

491
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,000
Aye, they might.

492
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,360
It feels so strange - as if a kitten had swallowed a snake.

493
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,560
Give him to Jacobs before he has one of your fingers. >

494
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,560
What's the object of this caper?

495
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:59,960
Tell her, Jacobs.

496
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Aye, sir. To save our prize lettuce from the rabbits.

497
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,960
They make such lovely pets - lettuce.

498
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,880
Ursula, do grow up.

499
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,000
Well, there's another prize lettuce - saved.

500
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,000
Right. You shall have it for lunch.

501
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,360
I can see how this game amuses you.

502
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:23,800
It's like your pit, this warren. Your men haven't got a hope.

503
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,800
They certainly breed like them.

504
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,600
Catch them in a net, or they perish in the dark.

505
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,400
Either way they're doomed.

506
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,800
Ursula lacks the courage of her convictions.

507
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,800
LAUGHS

508
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,960
Do you want to help me?

509
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Yes, Daddy.

510
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,000
Help plant some taties if you like.

511
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,160
See these? >

512
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,160
Hmm.

513
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,160
These are the sprouts. They have to stand straight.

514
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,160
We've to put them so far apart, do you see?

515
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,800
You stay here, I'll go down there and we'll meet in the middle.

516
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,760
What are you doing?! You're tramping on them!

517
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,800
That's like you - following your stupid nose.

518
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Ursula, dearest, what have I done?

519
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,080
Nothing.

520
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,640
Is it because of your Uncle Henry and me?

521
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,640
No... I'm glad.

522
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,120
He's invited me to stay on after you've gone.

523
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,120
But if you'd rather you and I went off somewhere...

524
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,960
No, I have to go home. I'm expecting my examination results.

525
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,640
You've nothing to worry about there.

526
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,320
You are fond of him, aren't you?

527
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,320
I've been fond of him ever since I was a child.

528
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,080
He's a man by himself. He has something apart from the rest.

529
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,360
Yes, I thought you'd get on.

530
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,320
I know you did.

531
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,560
"Love seeketh not itself to please."

532
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,600
But... Henry!

533
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Why not Henry?

534
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,600
I'd like to destroy his colliery.

535
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:49,160
And put everyone out of work?

536
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,160
I'd rather they starve and grub the earth for roots.

537
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,200
And what about us poor women? Huh?

538
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,320
Yes, I'll stay.

539
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,800
It'll be best.

540
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,160
Now, tell me you love me.

541
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,960
SIGHS: Yes.

542
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,320
DAD!

543
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,160
DAD!

544
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,440
Dad, guess what!

545
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,440
Has Billy had too much birthday cake and disgraced himself?

546
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Oh, Dad, please!

547
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,520
Does he like his tent?

548
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,520
Can't get him out of it. Dad, I passed my exams!

549
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,000
Hey! Well done, lass.

550
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,840
It came second post with a letter from my headmistress about a job.

551
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,120
A job?

552
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,120
Can't I go out to work?

553
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,440
Whatever for? You've enough to do helping your mother.

554
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,400
But I want some other kind of life!

555
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,400
What on earth do you mean by that?

556
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,440
- We'll discuss it after us tea.
- IMITATES FANFARE

557
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,880
# Happy birthday to you

558
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,240
# Happy birthday, dear Billy, Happy birthday... #

559
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,600
COMMOTION

560
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,600
CHILD CRIES >

561
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,200
Here, come here!

562
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,240
What's the matter? Billy, what have you done to Rupert?

563
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,320
Mother, do something with him.

564
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,120
Come here, let me show you...

565
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:53,440
Your turn next, Ursula. What would you like?

566
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Get her a bicycle, Dad, please.

567
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,240
To be free to earn my own keep. That's what I'd like best.

568
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,560
How will you do that?

569
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,600
I can become a teacher. I'm qualified by my matric.

570
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,600
Aye.

571
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,280
How much are you qualified to earn by your matric?

572
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,520
£50 a year. It's not much, but it's enough to live on.

573
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,520
What kind of teacher will you make?

574
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,920
You've no patience with your own brothers and sisters.

575
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:34,200
Some people don't think so.

576
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,200
Oh?

577
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,200
My headmistress, for one.

578
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,520
"I deeply sympathise with your desire to do something."

579
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,840
< "I shall be proud to see you win economic independence."

580
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,040
"It provides freedom of choice."

581
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,960
You did it behind our backs!

582
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,960
What do you mean?

583
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,320
School-leavers always have an interview with the headmistress.

584
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,000
"I see no reason why you shouldn't make a good teacher."

585
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,240
"After a year as an uncertified instructor, you could take a degree."

586
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,680
"That would give you the self-respect nothing else can."

587
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,760
She even sent an application form.

588
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,360
What's this about Kingston?

589
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:30,160
It's her old school. They've a vacancy. I can apply for an interview and have you sign it.

590
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,280
There's no way you're dancing off to London.

591
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,280
It's a good place to go.

592
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,160
How do you know?!

593
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,160
It's on the Thames, it's lovely.

594
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:45,640
You said, Mother, we have a right to what we want.

595
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,640
It's up to your father.

596
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,520
Why not get a post near here?

597
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,520
Something in town.

598
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,520
That slum!

599
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,320
I'd rather go right away. I'm fed up with housework.

600
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,880
Indeed?! You have too much opinion of yourself.

601
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,640
There's a place for me and I want to go.

602
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,680
You're not going.

603
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,680
Why not?!

604
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,680
That's why not!

605
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:22,440
London's full of troops off to South Africa - no place for a girl.

606
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,520
We'll see the local authorities about a place here.

607
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,160
You can put me off, but one day I'll get a place and I won't stop at home.

608
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,360
NOBODY WANTS YOU TO STOP AT HOME!

609
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,720
# Il etait une bergere Et ron et ron petit patapon #

610
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:52,200
# Il etait une bergere Qui gardait ses moutons Qui gardait ses moutons... #

611
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,240
KNOCKING

612
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,240
Come in.

613
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,360
Isn't it a nasty morning?

614
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,160
Yes, not much of weather.

615
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,600
Am I early?

616
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,480
Twenty-five past - you're second to come. I'm first this morning.

617
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,160
Must you do so many?

618
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,160
COUGHS

619
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,920
Fifty-six.

620
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,880
But they're not all for your class.

621
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,880
Why aren't they?

622
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,880
It's too many.

623
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,280
-  CHUCKLES:
- You've got about the same.

624
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,280
FOOTSTEPS

625
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,240
That'll be Miss Hardy, Headmaster's assistant.

626
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,680
Oh! You are early.

627
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,280
I'll warrant you don't keep that up.

628
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,320
That...is Mr Harvey's peg.

629
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,560
This...is yours.

630
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,280
Aren't you taking your hat off?

631
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,880
Standard Five teacher always has that one.

632
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,480
Isn't it a beastly morning?

633
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,480
POKES FIRE VIOLENTLY

634
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,480
Beastly!

635
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,080
If there's one thing I hate it's a wet Monday morning...

636
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,160
..kids trailing in anyhow.

637
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,880
This...belongs over there.

638
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,800
You've brought your apron, haven't you?

639
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,280
You've no idea what a sight you'll look before half past four.

640
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,120
Jim Richards! What are you doing, peering in? Come here!

641
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,960
I want you to go and askmyma for a pinny for Miss Brangwen.

642
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,800
Yes, miss.

643
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,920
What are you going for? And what shall you say to my ma?

644
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,920
School pinny, miss.

645
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:50,360
"Please, Mrs Harby, Miss Harby says to send down another pinafore for Miss Brangwen...

646
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:57,160
..because she's come without one."

647
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,160
Yes, miss.

648
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,160
< What are you going to say?!

649
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,120
Miss Harby wants a pinny for Miss Brangwin.

650
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,360
Miss BrangWEN. Be quick about it.

651
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,800
He's a caution, that boy - but not bad. Follow me!

652
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:23,000
Here we are. Standards Three, Four, Five and Six.

653
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,000
This is your place - Standard Five.

654
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,200
- TUTS:
- Mr Harvey will be teaching through there.

655
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,440
He'll be keeping an eye on you.

656
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,560
If you can find your way back to the teachers' room he'll be there.

657
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:58,640
You had a wet walk.

658
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,640
I don't mind. I'm used to it.

659
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,400
You will sign your name here.

660
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,360
And the time when you come and go.

661

CHILDREN PLAY OUTSIDE

662
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:26,080
Miss Brangwen, there are some exercise books on the top shelf.

663
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,520
Get them, would you ?

664
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,680
I'm so sorry.

665
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,960
CLEARS THROAT >

666
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,200
I'd let them in now.

667
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,000
Miss Brangwen, you will go to the lobby with Mr Brunt.

668
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,520
Door!

669
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,280
Sharp! Sharp!

670
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,840
Wake up! Wake up!

671
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,600
QUIET DOWN! QUIET!

672
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,760
In line!

673
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,760
WHAT DID I SAY?! QUIET!

674
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,480
Leaders in place! Standards Four, Five and Six...

675
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,760
..FALL IN!

PIANO PLAYS MARCHING TUNE

677
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,000
Class Five, quick march.

678
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,000
HALT!

679
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,440
Who told Standard Five to come in first like this?

680
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,680
I am responsible, Mr Harby.

681
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,720
This is Miss Brangwen, replacement teacher for Standard Five.

682
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,680
For her benefit we'll start again.

683
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,000
CRACKS KNUCKLES

685
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,800
Describe the modern factory and the assembly of a given product.

686
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,280
I will expect you...

687
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,680
We will start with a composition.

688
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,160
Write me a short essay on...

689
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,120
..the rabbit.

690
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,160
ALL GROAN

691
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,040
Miss, I got the pinny.

692
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:13,000
Thank you. Timmy, isn't it?

693
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,000
No, miss, it's Jim.

694
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm sorry. Thank you.

695
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,440
ROARS OF LAUGHTER

696
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,840
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?! >

697
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,960
Yes, Richards?

698
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,000
Sir, Miss forgot her pinny, and Miss Harby sent me for one of hers.

699
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,080
I put it in my satchel so it wouldn't get rained on...

700
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:52,600
..and there were chalk in it. I forgot, sir.

701
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,600
Spell the word "pinafore".

702
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,080
P-I-N-A-F-O-U-R

CHILDREN LAUGH

704
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,680
You will write "pinafore" 100 times on the blackboard after school.

705
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,880
Miss Brangwen will supervise you. This time she will supply the chalk.

706
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,920
LAUGHTER

707
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,120
Silence. Resume your studies.

708
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,600
I will examine your efforts in the morning.

709
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,240
Isn't it done?

710
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,240
Not yet.

711
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,960
I didn't know we had a stove. Must be jolly bringing lunch.

712
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:06,040
On the other hand, if one lived here it would be jollier to go home.

713
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,520
Miss Brangwen, if I were you I'd get a tighter hand on my class.

714
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,720
Would you? Aren't I strict enough?

715
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,720
They'll get you down if you don't tackle them.

716
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,720
They'll pull you down till Harby has you shifted.

717
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,360
You won't last a month if you don't tackle them.

718
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,600
But I...

719
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,600
He's got his eye on you.

720
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,840
< Get in his bad books and you'll be out.

721
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,640
Not that it matters to me, except I might have to cope with your class.

722
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:45,440
Will it be so terrible?

723
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,440
I don't know about terrible.

724
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,280
I do feel frightened. The children seem so...

725
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,680
So...what?

726
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,160
Mr Brunt says I must tackle my class.

727
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,000
You have to keep order to teach.

728
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,000
If you want to survive.

729
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,280
If you can't do that, what good are you?

730
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,200
You'll have to do it by yourself.

731
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,240
Indeed.

732
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,320
Some people can't be helped.

733
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:19,560
Do you think there will be a war?

734
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,560
More like a bloody massacre in your case.

735
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,360
When you say "Their fur is brown", how do you spell "their"?

736
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,080
Please, miss - T-H-E-I-R!

737
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,120
Richards. Stand up.

738
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,360
Who told you to call out?

739
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,400
I was answering, sir.

740
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,400
Go to my desk.

741
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,720
Pens down.

742
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,360
Fold arms.

743
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,240
What is the subject of your composition?

744
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,400
I wouldn't advise you to call out.

745
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,400
Well, Alice?

746
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,400
The rabbit, sir.

747
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,360
Not very difficult for Standard Five. Or very original.

748
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:13,760
Don't nibble your lip. You've written about rabbits so often you're turning into one.

749
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,040
BEATS BOY SIX TIMES >

750
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,440
That'll do, Richards, you can go.

751
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,440
But the master said 100 times.

752
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,440
I know, but you may go home now.

753
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,480
I said go home.

754
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,120
OW!

755
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,720
I cut my finger on a nail.

756
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,240
Where was that?

757
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,240
Erm...on my desk.

758
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,320
Show me, I'll take care of it.

759
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,320
Yes, thank you, I will tomorrow.

760
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:10,440
That Richards, Miss Brangwen, you've made a rod for your own back.

761
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,440
You're very young and inexperienced.

762
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,280
Hardly out of school yourself.

763
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,080
I could be very useful to you, Miss Brangwen.

764
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,840
I could make it easier for you.

765
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,880
So much easier. If only you'd...

766
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,800
I could swallow you whole.

767
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,920
You see, Miss Brangwen, only my cane rules this school.

768
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,440
SOBS

769
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,720
Hello, lass! How did it go?

770
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,440
Fine, Dad. It was a bit strange at first.

771
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,200
Bound to be. Hey, you just missed your Uncle Henry.

772
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,040
Oh?

773
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,040
Dropped in with a lady.

774
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,360
Oh?

775
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,360
< Your old teacher.

776
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,520
Miss Inger?

777
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,000
Aye. Seems they're getting married.

778
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
And guess what.

779
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,200
They want you to be chief bridesmaid.

780
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,240

< Relations, neighbours, friends, lift up your glasses and drink to the hearth and the home.

783
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,360
The hearth, the home, and may they enjoy them.

784
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,360
- ALL:
- The hearth, the home!

785
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:19,320
Night and day and may they enjoy it.

786
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,320
- ALL:

787
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:24,360
Hammer and tongs, and may they enjoy them.

788
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,360
Hammer and tongs!

789
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:30,040
Bed and blessings, and may they enjoy them.

790

- LAUGHS:
- Bed and blessings!

791
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,040
Marriage... Marriage...

792
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,040
CHATTER CONTINUES

793
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,520
Marriage is...

794
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,520
HUSH DESCENDS

795
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,520
It's what we're made for.

796
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,160
A man enjoys being a man.

797
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:48,040
< For what purpose was he made a man if not to enjoy it?

798
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,360
And likewise a woman enjoys being a woman.

799
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,240
Least in my eyes she does.

800
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,920
Now, for a man to be a man it takes a woman...

801
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:06,720
..and for a woman to be a woman it takes a man. >

802
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:14,120
And therefore we have marriage.

803
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,120
Don't run us off our legs.

804
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,920
There is no marriage in heaven, but on earth there is.

805
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:24,800
If there are no marriages in heaven, where do the angels come from?

806
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,800
LAUGHTER

807
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,000
Angels... If there's got to be angels...

808
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,880
There's got to be, hasn't there?

809
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:38,280
If there's got to be angels, and there are no men or women amongst them...

810
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,920
..it seems to me as a married couple makes one angel.

811
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,800
It's the drink!

812
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,960
Go on.

813
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,240
An angel has got to be more than a human being.

814
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:02,360
So I say an angel is the soul of a man and a woman in one.

815
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,520
And, and, and...!

816
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:11,920
No, wait! They rise up, united in the Judgement Day, as one angel.

817
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,440
Aye!

818
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,560
I had an angel up my nose once.

819
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,560
LAUGHTER

820
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,640
My mother said, "Why are you poking about up there?"

821
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,720
I said, "I've got an angel up my nose." She gave me such a swipe.

822
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:35,800
We called dandelion seeds "angels" and I'd stuffed one up my nose.

823
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,480
If I become an angel, it'll be my married soul, not my single soul.

824
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:51,480
So I say...an angel is the soul of a man and a woman...

825
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,320
..in one.

826
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,640
How lovely.

827
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,640
Praise the Lord.

828
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,880
ALL: Praise the Lord!

829
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,960
Praise the Lord!

830
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,240
BRASS BAND

831
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,760
Isn't it nice to have a wedding?

832
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,760
You have confetti in your hair.

833
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,080
I hear you're teaching.

834
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:29,840
Yes. I thought you might have gone off to war.

835
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,840
I embark at Southampton on Friday.

836
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,920
Do you want to go?

837
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,920
I want to go, yes.

838
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:39,840
Ladies and gentlemen, take your partners for the Lancers, please.

839
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,240
# JOLLY MUSIC #

840
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,200
Why do you want to go to war?

841
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,720
To do something genuine. It's a toy life, as it is.

842
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:57,560
What'll you be doing?

843
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:57,560
Making railways, building bridges, working like a slave.

844
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,080
But they'll be pulled down when the Army's done with them.

845
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,120
It's like a game.

846
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,120
Not to those taking part.

847
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,360
It's about the most serious business there is, fighting.

848
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,720
Why is fighting more serious than teaching, for instance?

849
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:21,200
You kill or get killed. It's serious enough, killing.

850
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:26,800
When you're dead you don't matter.

851
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,800
But it matters whether we settle the Boers.

852
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,800
Not to you or me. Do you want to live in Africa?

853
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,840
No, but we have to do this or it's the end of the nation.

854
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,640
But we aren't the nation. Heaps of others are.

855
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,840
Everybody could say that.

856
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,600
If everybody said it, there'd be no nation, but I should be myself.

857
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,840
You'd be at the mercy of every robber that came along.

858
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,840
They wouldn't get much.

859
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,920
I'd rather be swept off my feet by a robber than a soldier.

860
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,720
Only because you can't imagine me out of uniform.

861
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,840
Will this do?

862
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,360
Now may I steal your heart?

863
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,920
It's not my heart you want but my soul.

864
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,600
Kiss me.

865
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,000
Kiss me, Anton! Kiss me! Kiss me!

866
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,760
MUSIC & CHATTER

867
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,240
They see war as a game, anyway.

868
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,600
Bang!

869
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,600
Arghhhh!

870
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,280
Anton?

871
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,280
What?

872
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,160
Come back to me.

873
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,160
Yes.

874
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,880
You will come back to me?

875
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,880
I will come back.

876
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,080
I'm going to dance with Anton.

877
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,280
May I take the soldier?

878
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,040
Ursula's looking a bit upset.

879
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,040
Oh?

880
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,360
< Ask her to dance.

881
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,480
Go and ask her. Go and ask her now.

882
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,720
As father of the chief bridesmaid, may I have the pleasure?

883
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,880
Such a condition in a class.

884
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,880
I don't believe it. Simply disgraceful.

885
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:42,360
I can't think how you've been allowed to get like it.

886
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,960
Every Monday I shall examine these books...

887
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:51,480
..so don't think you can unlearn everything you've learned...

888
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,360
..and go back to Standard Three.

889
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:59,480
Why are you writing in pencil?

890
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,480
There aren't enough pens to go round.

891
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:03,000
Not enough pens, Miss Brangwen?

892
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,160
No. We are five short.

893
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,440
Oh. And how is that?

894
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:15,440
How many are here today?

895
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,440
Twenty-four.

896
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,960
How many pens are there? Staples?

897
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,720
Please, sir, 19.

898
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,000
That's very curious. A few days ago there were 24 pens.

899
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,440
Now there are 19. What's 19 from 24, Richards?

900
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,680
Please, sir?

901
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,680
I'm waiting, Richards.

902
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,040
Eleven, sir.

903
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:45,520
I would advise you to attend. 19 from 24 is 5, so there are five pens to account for.

904
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,320
Have you looked for them, Staples?

905
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,320
Yes, sir.

906
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,840
Am I to have thieving, besides your dirt, bad work and bad behaviour?

907
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:03,040
Not content with being the worst class in the school, you are thieves as well.

908
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:08,520
Pens do not melt into the air, or mizzle away into nothing.

909
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,760
They must be somewhere and they must be found by Standard Five.

910
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,160
They were lost by Standard Five and they must be found!

911
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,160
WHISTLE

912
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,360
No recreation until all pens are found.

913
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,280
Miss Brangwen will organise the search.

914
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:35,400
To start with, you will turn out your desks completely.

915
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,240
Not just your books, but conkers, string, sweets, everything.

916
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,360
Be quiet, Wesley. What is it?

917
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,360
Please, miss, Richards hit me.

918
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,720
Come in front, Richards.

919
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,360
I said come in front!

920
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,360
I SHAN'T!

921
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,080
Ah! Get off!

922
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,720
STAND STILL!

923
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,760
Fold your arms!

924
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
LAUGHTER

925
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,200
Get off me, you bitch!

926
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,200
OW!

927
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,720
OW!

928
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,080
Get off! >

929
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,240
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!

930
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,880
I've thrashed him.

931
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,080
Get up! Go and stand by my desk!

932
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:11,160
If you settle Benson and Staples the same way, you'll be all right.

933
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,920
Put your things away tidily!

934
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,920
Sharp! Sharp!

935
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:20,240
I said... put your things away tidily!

936
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:27,080
There will be no more time wasted looking for lost pens.

937
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,080
New pens will be issued first thing Monday morning.

938
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,000
Carry on!

939
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,640
What's he say?

940
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,680
You know perfectly well.

941
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:07,720
Since it's all about the weather, it must be in code.

942
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,320
There's a tatie pot in the oven for you.

943
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,160
Thanks, Mother.

944
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,560
Dad in church?

945
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,520
As usual.

946
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
Aren't you hungry?

947
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,320
Pay day!

948
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,320
You've been there a month already?

949
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,760
This is my board.

950
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,560
Fifty shillings.

951
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,680
Aye.

952
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,360
Come and get your dinner. Billy, bedtime.

953
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,880
That was the happiest day of her life.

954
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,880
A souvenir from the class bouquet?

955
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,040
A memento of her time at that prison.

956
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,080
I thought she enjoyed the challenge.

957
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,080
Nobody likes school.

958
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,280
You don't like your art school?

959
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,280
That's different.

960
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,760
Here's us at Scarborough in the holidays.

961
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,120
A few sunny days on parole.

962
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,680
Dad and I ran the handicrafts school.

963
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,920
Ursula spent her time at the harbour with the sailors.

964
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,840
No souvenirs of them?

965
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,440
Not here. There's plenty of you, though.

966
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,120
I've often wondered about this one. Who are those wretched folk?

967
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,320
The Boers. The enemy.

968
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:19,480
But they're civilians. And that woman - were you fighting women?

969
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:25,120
She had six notches in her rifle.

970
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,120
Why?

971
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,120
Six notches - six lives.

972
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,680
Carlisle College with the suffragettes - and the teachers.

973
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,880
Another prison?

974
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,840
This is beautiful.

975
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,680
A cross section of human hair. Such delicate abstraction.

976
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,920
I prefer the coarse reality.

977
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,920
Gudrun!

978
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,120
Anton was just admiring...your hair.

979
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,000
She was only being polite.

980
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,560
We were waiting for you.

981
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,520
Yes. Exams started late.

982
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,280
How did you do?

983
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,280
Not very well. You shouldn't have encouraged her.

984
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,680
No. But I was all agog.

985
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,160
You've been very busy these last two years, haven't you?

986
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,720
Yes. So have you, I gather.

987
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,760
Yes.

988
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:37,120
I'm very happy to see you.

989
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,120
Thank you.

990
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,720
Is there anything you'd like to do?

991
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:46,600
Is there anything we can do?

992
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,600
There's nothing to do here.

993
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
Then let's walk.

994
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,640
By the river?

995
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:04,200
I was quite flattered by the space allocated to me in your scrapbook.

996
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:08,240
Soldiering is more important than teaching.

997
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,880
I'd hoped you'd forgotten that.

998
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,520
The number of times I've regretted that last evening.

999
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,400
It could have ended there and then.

1000
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:26,560
No, you were right. I enjoyed that awful school because I had such high hopes for college.

1001
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:33,160
I saw it as a kind of religious retreat, a temple dedicated to truth and learning.

1002
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:38,080
In reality, it's just a factory where you learn to make money.

1003
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,280
In the Army, we earn glory.

1004
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:44,000
I read the casualty lists every week. It was horrible.

1005
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I knew I'd come back.

1006
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I went back to our church once. Everything was clean and orderly.

1007
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,200
Seemed like a dream.

1008
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,040
It's getting dark.

1009
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,360
Shall I hold your hand?

1010
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:07,480
I'm not afraid of the dark in England - it's soft and natural.

1011
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:11,520
It's my medium. Especially when you are here.

1012
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,560
The darkness, were you afraid of it in Africa?

1013
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:21,200
Yes. The darkness there is filled with fear, like the smell of blood.

1014
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,280
The blacks know it. They worship it.

1015
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:28,680
The darkness. One almost likes it. The fear -...

1016
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,920
..something sensual.

1017
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,760
Did you think of me in the darkness?

1018
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,760
You were at the back of everything.

1019
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,160
I had to come back to you.

1020
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,200
This is lovely.

1021
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:38,520
The last time I was here it was under false pretences, too.

1022
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:44,880
Another lover?

1023
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,880
Yes!

1024
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,880
Aren't I the first?

1025
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,880
First and last. No, it was Winifred.

1026
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,680
Really?

1027
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,480
She was my first great passion.

1028
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,840
I'm sure she said above the front door. Here we are.

1029
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,560
Welcome.

1030
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:13,360
I'm glad you're not always naked or all the women'd fall in love with you

1031
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,800
They do, regularly. I'm considered quite a catch.

1032
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:23,040
Oh! Not a fish out of water, I hope, flapping about on the ground.

1033
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:27,000
Oh, no, there's my colonel's daughter, for instance.

1034
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,320
SNIFFS

1035
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,880
Scent?

1036
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,880
Soap.

1037
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,880
Soap!

1038
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,120
GIGGLES

1039
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:28,920
Would you rather live in India or England when we're married?

1040
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,920
India, by far. Nice of you to ask.

1041
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:33,240
It was decided long ago, wasn't it? When I first kissed you.

1042
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:38,040
You'll like India. There's a good social life, hunting, polo.

1043
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,320
I'll teach you to ride.

1044
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:46,880
Plenty of servants...who'll cook, bathe babies, keep you cool.

1045
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,800
I'll teach little Hindus to write essays on the rabbit!

1046
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:58,640
You wouldn't have to teach, you wouldn't have to do anything.

1047
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:03,440
But I do want to teach, and I don't want to be with other people.

1048
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,280
I want to be like this. Isn't this enough?

1049
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,840
It's enough for now.

1050
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,440
Then let's have no more talk of marriage.

1051
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:19,560
Which means that I'm to get supper tomorrow?

1052
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,560
I'll keep you to that!

1053
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,520
BLOWS HORN

1054
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,680
Strawberries! Strawberries! Fresh ripe strawberries!

1055
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,880
Shush, you'll wake them.

1056
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,960
All this hollering and pounding.

1057
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,400
I expected them up at this hour.

1058
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,400
Woman, you have a fickle memory.

1059
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,840
Strawberries! Fresh ripe strawberries!

1060
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,640
What a bore!

1061
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,640
She's supposed to be chaperoning us. We're supposed to be her guests.

1062
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:55,200
Were you expecting her?

1063
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,200
Didn't I say?

1064
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,040
< Lt Skrebensky, your staff sergeant here.

1065
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,480
< Ursula! Anton! I wonder where they are.

1066
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:07,680
< Maybe they've gone out.

1067
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,680
< Don't be stupid, woman.

1068
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,160
BABY CRIES

1069
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:21,320
Good morning, grocer. Kindly leave them on the doorstep and go away!

1070
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,520
Why have you got your bloomers round your neck?

1071
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,720
< Anton's wearing my nightie!

1072
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:41,000
But do you love him?

1073
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
It isn't a question of love. I love him well enough.

1074
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,400
More than anyone else.

1075
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,400
And I shall never love anyone else the same again.

1076
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:56,000
What does it mean, love? It doesn't lead anywhere.

1077
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,520
It isn't supposed to lead anywhere. It's an end in itself.

1078
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:05,520
Then I could love a hundred men one after the other.

1079
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,760
Why should I end as Mrs Skrebensky, social wife?

1080
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:16,760
Why not love all the types I fancy, as Ursula Brangwen, spinster, school mistress?

1081
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:23,520
Then you don't love him.

1082
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:23,520
I tell you, I do. Quite as much, and perhaps more, than any of the others.

1083
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,440
But there are things that aren't in Anton that I'd love in other men.

1084
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,440
Like what?

1085
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:35,960
An understanding, a directness. A man who could let go - reckless and passionate.

1086
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,760
What is this fantastic fulfilment you're hankering after?

1087
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,200
Is it just other men? Hmm? >

1088
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:48,000
If it is, you'd better marry Anton.

1089
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,960
The other thing can only end badly.

1090
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,320
So I'm to marry out of fear of myself?

1091
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,360
< We're ready for you!

1092
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,880
< Time for mixed doubles.

1093
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:08,000
I can see you on an elephant - amongst adoring natives.

1094
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,560
I shall be glad to leave England, it's so unspiritual.

1095
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:14,560
Leave the home of democracy?

1096
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,080
Democracy... is only for the degenerate races.

1097
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:25,200
Why is democracy unspiritual?

1098
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:25,200
Because only the ugly and the greedy succeed.

1099
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,000
The people elect the government.

1100
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:35,240
But what are the people? Each of them has a money interest, and they choose those who have money.

1101
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,160
They rule in the name of money.

1102
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:41,000
To me democracy means equality.

1103
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,040
The equality of the wage packet is a democracy of dirt.

1104
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:50,360
Then you should give away your worldly goods.

1105
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:50,360
Or join us filthy aristocrats!

1106
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,400
Up onto the pedestal!

1107
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,720
Revolutionaries and aristocrats don't mix.

1108
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,800
But she is an aristocrat - of the spirit.

1109
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,080
YES!

1110
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,400
Stay just as long as you like.

1111
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:13,640
As long as you don't want to play croquet at the hall!

1112
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,040
Bye!

1113
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,520
Marriage agrees with them.

1114
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,520
Meaning they agree with each other.

1115
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:32,120
It's a little odd, though.

1116
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:32,120
Odd?

1117
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,120
Something unnatural about Winifred.

1118
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,840
Yes, she has two left feet.

1119
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,840
I meant her tendencies.

1120
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,440
She should be in a freak show(!)

1121
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:45,520
Your relationship isn't healthy. Just as well we're going to India.

1122
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,520
You say the Indians aren't healthy.

1123
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,080
We'll improve health standards.

1124
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,080
I meant you might find them freakish.

1125
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:54,000
Ursula, you must come with me for your own good.

1126
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,840
You'll govern the Indians for their own good with your dead judgements.

1127
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:04,400
If they have to bow down to you, I do not. You're so self-righteous!

1128
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,640
Aren't you righteous, in your own mind?

1129
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:14,200
Yes! But at least I am something. There's nobody there where you are.

1130
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,960
Are you anybody, with your old dead things?

1131
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,960
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1132
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,120
Yes, you did.

1133
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,080
The words came out without my knowing.

1134
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,200
They didn't mean anything really.

1135
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,800
You're a romantic, up on some hill...

1136
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:50,000
..so you'll always be looking down, always disappointed.

1137
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,040
Why must I climb that hill, Anton? Why not stay below?

1138
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,800
Why force one's way up, step after step, for a moment of exhilaration at the top...

1139
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,880
..only to plunge into a dark valley?

1140
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:11,720
When shall we be married?

1141
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:11,720
I don't know!

1142
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,720
Don't you want to be married?

1143
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,720
I don't think I do!

1144
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:17,560
You mean never, or not yet?

1145
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,560
I mean never.

1146
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:26,000
He may take you back. You'll have to wait for his reply to your letter.

1147
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,840
I was full of apologies for my perverse, selfish behaviour.

1148
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,160
The child will make a difference.

1149
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,800
That's what decided me.

1150
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:43,280
I must go to him, because it's his child and because...

1151
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,280
..he once loved me.

1152
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,480
Is that the only reason?

1153
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,840
Croquet!

1154
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,920
I thought about my mother, too.

1155
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:59,240
If it was enough for her to have her man and children, why not for me?

1156
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:04,240
Why do I punish those who love me? I should be grateful for them.

1157
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:10,840
Do your parents know?

1158
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,840
I couldn't tell them so soon after failing my degree.

1159
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,960
What if Anton says no?

1160
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,120
I'll live at home with the child and go back to teaching.

1161
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,480
You haven't even seen a midwife.

1162
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:27,720
What if Anton says yes, you go to India and you find you're not with child?

1163
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,680
You'll come straight back, that's what you'll do.

1164
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:42,680
A child binds you to a man as securely as if you were handcuffed.

1165
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,760
Aren't you and Henry...?

1166
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,760
Very good companions.

1167
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:54,560
But remember, you will always be welcome here.

1168
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,360
GONG

1169
01:36:56,360 --> 01:37:01,000
Tea.

1170
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:01,000
I won't stop.

1171
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,000
Henry'll be back soon.

1172
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,600
It's getting late. I'll get my things.

1173
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,560
WHINNIES

1174
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,520
WHINNYING

1175
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,160
HOOVES THUNDER

1176
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:51,520
LAUGHTER

1177
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:31,640
- < ..SEVERAL VOICES:
- < # ..Gently down the stream

1178
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:36,240
< # Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream

1179
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:40,560
< # Row, row, row your boat Gently down the stream... #

1180
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,600
< SINGING CONTINUES

1181
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,000
SCREAM

1182
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:33,160
Your mother said to let you lie in, but I had to see you were all right.

1183
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:35,120
Thanks, Dad.

1184
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,960
< We wondered where you'd got to.

1185
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,600
No bike or anything.

1186
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,720
Me and your mother were worried.

1187
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:53,680
And er...then we saw the telegram had gone.

1188
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:56,520
Yes, I saw you'd opened it.

1189
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,880
The boy asked if there was a reply. Naturally your mother thought...

1190
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:08,360
No marriage, no bike, no wonder you were worried.

1191
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:15,360
The bike's in a ditch. Is that where you expected to find me?

1192
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,600
I can see there's nothing much wrong with you.

1193
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,920
You were quite feverish earlier.

1194
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,000
I caught a chill.

1195
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,360
I heard the party. Didn't want to be a wet blanket.

1196
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,560
Don't be so silly.

1197
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:38,360
Your mother took the children out. Anything I can get you?

1198
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:42,320
No thanks, Dad. I think I'll lie in for a while.

1199
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,160
Thanks for the tea.

1200
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,000
Aye.

1201
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,800
Goodbye, lass.

1202
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,840
Bye, Dad.

1203
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,520
Don't work too hard.

1204
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:57,840
I'm er... I'm in town today. Thought I'd drop in your old school.

1205
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,680
Whatever for?

1206
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:03,360
Well, now that you're...

1207
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,360
Now that you're...

1208
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:09,600
Now that I'm an old maid?

1209
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,600
Let me finish.

1210
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,800
Now you're not off to the other side of the world...

1211
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,600
Or even the other side of London.

1212
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:22,440
I was just going to say that... this has always been, and always will be, your home.

1213
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:33,720
Hey, look, there's a rainbow.
