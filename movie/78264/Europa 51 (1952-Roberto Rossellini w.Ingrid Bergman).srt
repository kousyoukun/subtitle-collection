00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,880
My legs, my poor legs! Why
are they striking?

3
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:55,920
- Because you don't have a social
conscience. - And you? - I do.

4
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:58,800
- Don't your legs hurt ?
- Sure they do!

5
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:30,846
- Good evening. The elevator
is broken. - It's hardly a surprise!

6
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:53,746
- How are you, Michel ?
Is he in ? - Yes, Mrs.

7
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:57,905
- Is everything all right ? - I believe so.
- I'll have a look at the dinner table.

8
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:06,977
Yes, very well.
Take this, please.

9
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:14,657
- Did you do your homeworks ?
- Yes.

10
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:17,665
What's going on ? Come here !

11
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:21,746
- Listen, I need to talk to you.
- Yes, Michel.

12
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:26,223
- Hello, George ! 
- What happened to you? It's so late !

13
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:30,499
Oh, yes, I know ! Blame the strike !

14
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:33,345
There was a big mess in Largo Argentina

15
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,901
They rerouted me through
an endless series of alleys !

16
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:39,986
I wanted to tell you that I had
to invite aunt Margareth and her son.

17
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:43,656
- Tonight ? - She called me
once you went out.

18
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:46,665
She'll be in Rome just for
three days, I didn't know what to tell her.

19
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:48,698
There won't have been
another occasion.

20
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:51,944
You're really sympathetic
towards Andrea and his ideas.

21
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:54,865
Maybe in front of his mother
he'll avoid to raise the crowd.

22
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:57,705
At least you, try to be fast,
I need to change my dress!

23
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:09,977
- Tell me: what did you do
all day long - Nothing.

24
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:13,542
What do you mean, nothing ?
It's ringing, call Cesira.

25
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:22,736
- Can you listen to me, now ?
- Sure, but be fast.

26
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:24,778
Come in!

27
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:28,297
Cesira, I don't know if
I already told you, in the kitchen...

28
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:30,986
..to cook something light
for Mrs. Casati.

29
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:33,825
Mafalda boiled some of the fish
she bought for the child.

30
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,745
Fine. Thanks. You may go, Cesira.

31
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:38,664
Mom, can you listen to me ?

32
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:43,019
Go ahead. But turn around,
I need to undress.

33
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:53,699
- So, what did you want to say ?
- I'm not gonna say anything anymore.

34
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:56,102
You really want to make me
mad. Come on, what's up ?

35
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:58,183
I've been alone all day
in this house.

36
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:01,822
-Didn't your support teacher
come ? - No, not even today.

37
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:04,586
Probably because of the strike...
There was no public transportation.

38
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:07,699
Even last week he missed
two days in a row.

39
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:09,658
You knew he wasn't feeling fine.

40
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:13,700
I'll call him tomorrow and
we'll send a car for him. Happy ?

41
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,183
- No.
- So, what is it that you want ?

42
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:22,142
I don't like my support teacher,
he talks a lot and he's always too close.

43
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,940
He sweats, he laughs... I don't like him.

44
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,820
You wish you could be with
your nanny again, don't you?

45
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:31,064
But you are a man now,
you need a man like you.

46
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:33,302
Oh, God, that Cesira !

47
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:38,944
Cesira, get my white dress and
my shoes ready ! Quick !

48
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:43,105
- I'm sorry, with all this confusion...
- Good evening. - Good evening, Mrs.

49
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:46,105
- Is the champagne cooling in the fridge?
- Yes, yes.

50
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:50,546
- Go get it. - Sure.

51
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,782
George, go ahead in the meanwhile.

52
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,418
I'll be ready soon.

53
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,465
- Good night, Michel.
- Bye.

54
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,903
- Where were we ?
- Where have you been today ?

55
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,338
I've been... What do you mean,
''Where have you been today'' ?

56
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,503
Should you ask such questions
to your mother ?

57
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:14,459
We really need
to talk:...

58
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,340
..It's completely unproper for a guy
like you, who owns everything...

59
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:20,459
..to be always nervous and unhappy,
like a crybaby.

60
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:23,943
- We'll talk about it later.
- Where's mom ? - Here.

61
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:27,502
- Hello. Quick, the Orange are
already here. - I'm coming.

62
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:31,381
I have to tell you what
happened at the Antonelli's place !

63
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:34,146
You look so good !

64
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:55,499
Good evening ! How are you ?

65
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,107
- Dear ! - Hello !
- Good evening ! - Good evening !

66
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:00,058
Look what Richard brought
for Michel !

67
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:03,941
Thanks ! He'll be very happy !
So kind of you, Richard.

68
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:07,184
- Here's aunt Margareth.
- Aunt Margareth ! How are you?

69
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,457
- Good evening, Irene.
- Good evening. - Good evening.

70
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:13,022
- She's better, don't you think ?
- Yes. She lost a little weight, maybe.

71
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:16,503
- Let me introduce you to Mrs. Orange.
- How do you do.

72
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:18,458
- Mister Chandler.
- How do you do.

73
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,816
Mister Orange.
Do you remember Luciana ?

74
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,937
Mrs. Casati
and her son Andrea.

75
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:24,978
Come sit down, aunt Margareth.

76
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:29,896
- Let's show Michel his toy.
Call him, he has yet to make it to bed. - Yes.

77
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,780
- What do we want to drink?
You already have something. - Yes, thanks.

78
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,738
Aunt Margareth, care for a drink ?

79
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,540
No, thanks.
Or maybe a vermouth, a little bit.

80
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:41,660
- A vermouth. Andrea ?
- Nothing, thanks. - Nothing ?

81
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:45,905
- Here. And me ? Luciana, what do you want?
- A dry Martini.

82
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:49,701
Good idea, I'll go along with it !
Ah, Michel !

83
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:53,899
Look what Mister Orange brought
you ! Say hello to aunt Margareth.

84
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:57,826
You grow up so fast !
Last year you were like this !

85
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:01,064
But you're a bit pale, my dear.
Maybe too much study, eh ?

86
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:04,702
- Yes, it's true. He looks tired.
- Michel ?

87
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:09,102
- Did you say hello to Mrs. Orange ?
- Hello, dear. - Good evening.

88
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:14,267
- Do you remember your cousin Andrea ?
- How are you, Michel ? - Fine.

89
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,901
Say thanks to Mr.Orange.

90
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:19,299
Thanks.

91
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:23,463
Ins't it wonderful ?
Are you happy ?

92
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:26,863
Say goodbye to everybody, now.
Go and be nice, ok ?

93
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,943
- Did you all get served ?
- yes, thanks.

94
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:30,978
How long are you staying,
Aunt Margareth ?

95
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,495
Up until my husband will
be done with his businesses.

96
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:37,256
- Do we want to try the train ?
- Why not ? - Let's go.

97
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:50,705
What are you doing, there ?
Do you want to have fun all on your own ?

98
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:52,977
Do we want to go and see ?

99
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,742
- Let's stop it.
- Your glass.

100
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:11,306
- Thanks. Now, rear motion !
- It's really funny ! It seems true !

101
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:15,775
- Mrs., the meal is served.
- Lunch is ready !

102
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,224
Do we want to go ?

103
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:23,337
- It's funny even for adults.
- Do you want to sit down ?

104
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:27,141
Aunt Margareth, Richard:
are you hungry ?

105
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:32,706
You're here, Richard here,...

106
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:38,379
..Andrea to my left,
then George...

107
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:41,942
No, I'm wrong,
aunt Margareth will sit right there.

108
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:46,060
Richard to her right
and George there. Let's sit down.

109
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:49,144
Sorry, I'm always wrong.

110
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:51,257
Aunt Margareth.

111
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,026
These things make me confused,
I always make a mess.

112
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,862
- How long have you been in Italy?
- Many years.

113
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:04,502
I studied in Florence
with my sister, George's mother.

114
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:07,425
Then I married an italian,
Vladimiro Casati.

115
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,822
- Does your son work in Italy ?
- Yes, here in Rome.

116
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,700
- What does he do ?
- He's a journalist.

117
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:18,105
A journalist ? Then he might be able to
tell us if there will be peace or war.

118
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,183
I'd say peace.

119
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:24,505
You're very optimistic, bless you.
I'll believe there will be war.

120
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:28,017
- I hope for peace.
- I can't see how. Am I wrong ?

121
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,865
I have some particular ideas
in this regard.

122
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:33,865
You're so keen on politics !
I don't get any of it !

123
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,785
- Have you been to that horse contest ?
- Excuse me a sec.

124
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,466
I would like you to tell me
why you are so optimistic.

125
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,544
Because there's so many of us, in the world,
wishing for peace, my lady.

126
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:45,579
Yvonne dear, maybe it's
better to change topic.

127
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:47,777
Andrea is a leftie.

128
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:51,900
- A socialist ?
- Worst than that, I'm afraid.

129
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:55,542
Mrs., Michel told me to
call you. You'd better go.

130
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:03,426
Excuse me, I'm going to
check on my son.

131
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:06,584
To peace ! Cin cin !

132
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:19,382
I solved many problems,
but this boy is an enigma.

133
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:24,626
- What's up ? - I feel sick.
- Your stomach ? - yes, it hurts.

134
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:30,424
- Where does it hurt ? - All over.
- Here ? - Ouch ! - Here ? - Oh...

135
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:35,495
You're fine. Stay put, do not put
on the same show.

136
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:39,620
- You're not a child anymore!
- I can't sleep. Stay with me for a while.

137
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,818
I can't, we have guests.
Don't be silly, sleep now.

138
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,098
- Go away, I dont want to see you !
- Be nice !

139
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:49,344
Aren't you ashamed ? You're naked !

140
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:00,866
It's Michel again.

141
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:04,695
Go to see if you can calm him.

142
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:13,942
Cesira, tell him I said to be
nice and sleep.

143
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:16,103
He's so nervous since a while...

144
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:19,583
He had a nanny since he was born,
up until six months ago,...

145
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:22,699
..then George decided to send her away:
maybe that's why he's so nervous.

146
00:12:22,747 --> 00:12:25,500
Boys that age would better
stay in a college.

147
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:28,220
Michel is not like the other
boys, he's very sensible.

148
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:31,464
Even for me it's difficult to
understand him. And I'm his mother.

149
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:34,544
Just imagine how little
would others understand.

150
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,136
Nowadays educational systems
are very, very forward.

151
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:41,145
It's true. Our Switzerland
colleges are wonderful.

152
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:44,384
I think it's isolation that
makes children perky.

153
00:12:44,427 --> 00:12:46,418
That's my thought, too.

154
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:50,221
Look at Chandler's son: he's in
a college and perfectly ok.

155
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,303
Really.

156
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,338
He's just one year
older than Michel and a while ago...

157
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,982
..he flew in from Boston all on his own
and he left to go back nice and smooth.

158
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,622
Over the Atlantic on a plane ?
Weren't you scared to send him ?

159
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,703
Not really !
He had a lot of fun.

160
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:05,977
I understand.

161
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,746
Keep in mind that while George was
fighting at the front, during the war...

162
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:13,338
..Michel and I stayed in England
during the bombings.

163
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:15,537
Lady, the child hurt himself !

164
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,896
- Where ?
- Down the stairs !

165
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:28,696
- Michel !
- Don't worry, it's nothing serious !

166
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:32,581
- Michel ! But...
- Easy, lady.

167
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:35,619
Cesira, give me the car keys !

168
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,820
The keys are in the fur coat
pockets !

169
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,823
Ahead ! Keep going ahead !

170
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:13,979
Santo Spirito Hospital,
towards Castel Sant'Angelo !

171
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,698
Nothing serious:
his femur is lightly fractured.

172
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:48,898
He threw up, but I guess we
can exclude cerebral commotion.

173
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:53,145
He's now in the operating room.
He's sedated. They're almost done.

174
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,862
I would like Alessandrini to visit him.
I'll try calling him again.

175
00:14:56,907 --> 00:15:00,297
He would like to make a phone call.
Can you escort him ?

176
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:09,139
Poor Irene !

177
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:16,618
Michel !

178
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,579
- Doctor...
- Everything is fine, Mrs.

179
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:37,245
Don't cry, everything will be fine.

180
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:53,124
I'm sorry.
These things happen to childrens.

181
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:57,001
- Call the doctor on duty.
- His femur is fractured.

182
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:01,086
Recovery will be long,
but you shouldn't worry.

183
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:04,955
- Cassiani.
- Nice to meet you. No complications?

184
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,477
- Just a light shock state - Ah...
- Can't we bring him home ?

185
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,518
Not yet,
he's still sedated.

186
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,035
Can't we at least find a
room to rent ?

187
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,601
It's impossible for tonight,
maybe tomorrow.

188
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:17,842
But tomorrow
you might bring him home.

189
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,803
When did they inject him ?

190
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:32,398
I've just put him in bed.
Can you see how calm he is ?

191
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:36,838
- Morphine to so young a child...
Isn't it dangerous ? - No.

192
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:40,721
And it's not morphine, it's Pantopon,
a weaker sedative.

193
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:46,046
- Wouldn't it hurt him ?
- No. Don't worry.

194
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:53,355
Fractures like that are very painful
during the first days.

195
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:56,001
Yes, I understand.

196
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:01,678
Lady...
Mr. Casati is here.

197
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:04,685
Let him through.
I'm outside.

198
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:10,025
- Please, sit down.
- Good morning, Andrea.

199
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:12,820
- How are you ?
- Not that fine.

200
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:16,985
- It might have gone worst.
- I'm very confused.

201
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:21,225
Try not to think about it.

202
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:26,660
- I just came to say goodbye. I'm going
away for a few days - Yes ?

203
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:31,383
- Is there something I might
do for you? - No, thanks.

204
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:39,024
I don't know if it's a good idea,
to be telling you this.

205
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:42,821
The hospital doctor, which is a
friend of mine, told me that...

206
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:49,784
..he had the impression that
the fall was voluntary.

207
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:54,218
- What do you mean with "voluntary" ?
- Nothing. Stay calm, Irene.

208
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:57,179
Apparently Michel said some
things while still sedated...

209
00:17:57,227 --> 00:18:00,060
..and so my friend thought he
needed to let you know.

210
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:03,224
He told me so that I could find
the most proper way to...

211
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,957
It's absurd !

212
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:10,966
Maybe, but my friend said
that sensible children...

213
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,523
..are capable of everything,
even of such extreme gestures.

214
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:19,162
- It's impossible ! Andrea !
- Stay calm, at times children are...

215
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:22,517
Mom ? Mom?

216
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:26,599
I'm coming. Excuse me a sec.

217
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,276
- So basically he attempted
suicide ? - Not exactly.

218
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:34,286
Maybe he just wanted to hurt himself
to attract some attention.

219
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:36,966
But go now, don't make him
wait, stay close to him.

220
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:40,443
We'll talk when I'll be back.
Don't think about it. All my best.

221
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,763
You've been very dear. Goodbye.

222
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:48,076
Mom ?

223
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,920
Here I am. Excuse me, my dear.

224
00:18:56,487 --> 00:19:00,321
- How do you feel ?
- Hm...

225
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:07,717
Don't move.
Please, stay still.

226
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:15,118
Do you want me to stay here, like this ?

227
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,197
Go in the other room,
I'll stay with the child.

228
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,886
Sit wherever you want.

229
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,075
Happy now ?

230
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:45,435
Here... Let's stay close
like when you were wee.

231
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:50,356
Do you remember, during the war
when you came to sleep with me...

232
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:54,286
..with your frozen feet ?

233
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:58,286
It felt nice, crouched
under the covers !

234
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:06,996
Do you remember hearing the sirens ?

235
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:13,395
You said: ''Bombs'',
and then you fell asleep.

236
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:19,240
You didn't even realize when we
descended in the basement.

237
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:25,442
I carried you
all wrapped up in covers !

238
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:33,123
Do you remember that wonderful sunny
day, in the contryside...

239
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,796
..when that soldier was rude to me,
for no reason at all.

240
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:42,046
- What did you tell him ?
- I don't remember. What did I tell him ?

241
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:46,399
You stood up like a grown man
and told him:...

242
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:49,883
...''Do you want me to punch
you on your nose?''.

243
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:55,120
My man !

244
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:59,796
And do you remember when daddy came
back from war ?

245
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:05,558
Then you weren't with me anymore.

246
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:14,885
I'll be with you again !
I'm here with you !

247
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:18,806
- Like when I had my appendix done ?
- Yes !

248
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:23,284
Yes, like that time,
just like that time !

249
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:27,240
I'll be forever with you !
Forever and ever and ever !

250
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:06,765
- Michel did not have an accident.
- What ? What are you saying ?

251
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:10,686
Michel, I'm saying...

252
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:15,039
It was no accident. He tried
to kill himself.

253
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:20,286
Come on dear, stop your imagination.

254
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:24,320
No, it's true, he tried to kill himself.

255
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:29,236
It's impossible !
It's absurd, there are no reasons.

256
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:36,756
- Who said that ?
- The hospital doctor told Andrea.

257
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:40,482
He's crazy! They're both crazy!

258
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:46,922
No... no, dear, it's true.

259
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,604
I understood it by myself.

260
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:58,356
And he told me.
In his way, but he told me.

261
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:02,241
Oh, George, we should change everything
in our life !

262
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:06,075
We must !
We can't continue like this !

263
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:20,717
George ? George !

264
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:24,243
- What happened ?
- No !

265
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:27,563
- Let me in ! What happened ?
- You can't get in, it's too late !

266
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:30,246
- Let me in !
- He's dead !

267
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:33,677
- He's dead ! He's dead !
- Michel ! Michel !

268
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:38,360
Quick, Lady's mother want to see what
we have prepared.

269
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,523
Put it here.

270
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:45,118
I can't take it anymore !
Three sleepless night in a row.

271
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,322
Is it ok, Mrs. ?

272
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:05,319
It's fine, Cesira.
Bring it in.

273
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,916
One cannot survive on
orange juice alone !

274
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:15,240
I'll go to see her.

275
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:28,318
- Good evening, dear. How do you feel ?
- Fine enough.

276
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:32,800
Why didn't you eat anything ?

277
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:37,875
I didn't feel like. I'll eat later.

278
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:40,805
You can't go on like this...

279
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:45,682
..ten days without moving
or even eating !

280
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:47,797
You need to shake yourself off.

281
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:51,999
Please, I'm fine.
I'll get better.

282
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:57,041
Don't want to bore you, but i need to
insist, for your own good.

283
00:24:57,087 --> 00:25:00,966
- Oh, George...
- Please, let me finish.

284
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:06,127
Even against our will,
we must go on with life.

285
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:12,481
Life goes on and...
we have to follow it.

286
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,957
Think about your mother.

287
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:22,684
At her age, she flew in from
America just to see you !

288
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:27,442
And in three days
you almost didn't speak to her.

289
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:32,277
If you don't want to think about
yourself, think about her, at least.

290
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:37,003
No, George, I can't.
Try to explain it to her.

291
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:43,599
I need to stay alone.
I need a lot of rest.

292
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:46,639
Come in.

293
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:53,602
It's from London.

294
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:58,637
Hello ? Hello !

295
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,236
Can you speak louder?
I can't hear.

296
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:10,917
Ah, yes... Thanks.

297
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:14,764
Good.
I'll send you a cablegram.

298
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,799
No, call me at the office
tomorrow morning.

299
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:20,361
Thanks. Goodbye.

300
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:27,560
Don't worry for me, George,
it will pass, but I need time.

301
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:31,759
- Why don't you take one of these
sleeping pills ? They might help. - Yes.

302
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:37,439
- You'd sleep. You need rest
more than anything else - Yes.

303
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:41,082
Sleep would do more
than any cure.

304
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:44,756
Yes, yes dear, don't worry,
don't worry, but...

305
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:48,965
Please, don't leave mom alone.

306
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:53,319
Go to her, then come back to me
after you've had lunch.

307
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:05,165
- Should I turn off the lights ?
- Yes, please.

308
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:40,122
Hello, who is it ?
Oh, Andrea, it's her!

309
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:43,876
Yes, I called her many times,
I wanted to talk.

310
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:50,480
Yes... It's urgent.
Won't tonight be fine ?

311
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:55,759
Ah, excuse me, but it's so
important for me !

312
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,846
No, no, I'm coming to you.

313
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:04,563
Yes, right now. Where's the newspaper office?

314
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:08,885
Sure, right now. I'll be there
in a while. Yes.

315
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:21,603
- Irene dear...
- Did you know ?

316
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:26,926
- So sudden...
-It was an embolism.

317
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:30,118
Tell me:
what can I do for you ?

318
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:35,878
Nothing, I'm afraid. Nothing.

319
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,760
- Where are we going ?
- Wherever you want. I don't care.

320
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:42,766
I don't know. A quiet place,
where we could talk.

321
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:46,846
Oh, I was anxiously waiting
for your return !

322
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:49,606
Had I known all the details
beforehand...

323
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:54,357
- I called the newspaper so many
times ! - They told me.

324
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:58,241
And now that I can ask you
all the questions,...

325
00:28:58,287 --> 00:29:02,075
..I feel that it's useless.

326
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:09,601
Irene, don't be like this.
Try to be strong, please.

327
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:14,880
- At times I don't know what I'm doing.
- I understand you, dear.

328
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:18,840
- Where are you going now ? Back to the newspaper ?
- No, not yet.

329
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:22,641
I might stay a bit more with you,
if you wish. Turn left.

330
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:24,962
I'm not very entertaining.

331
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:52,357
Why don't we step outside ?

332
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:55,717
Let's breathe some air
and talk a bit.

333
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:17,358
- This square is impressing, isn't it ?
- Yes...

334
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:22,964
Michel must have said rather painful
things, during the anesthesia,...

335
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:26,795
..to make so that the doctor could
understand it was a voluntary gesture.

336
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:30,237
Listen to me, Irene,
don't torment yourself.

337
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,320
Ah, Andrea, what a fatality !

338
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,962
If things had gone otherwise !

339
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:42,397
Had I said a word, made a gesture
rather than another...

340
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:46,565
Do you understand how atrocious it is
that a word one can't delete...

341
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:50,998
..resulted in Michel's death ?

342
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:55,199
I can't take it anymore,
I can't live, I can't !

343
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:59,798
Irene, torment is useless.

344
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:03,237
Useless to repeat: ''Had I said...
Had I done...'' ?

345
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,517
Things are what they are.

346
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:09,719
It was destiny, then.
Why such a destiny ?

347
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,601
I never mentioned
destiny. What destiny ?

348
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:16,286
Then, if it isn't destiny,
I'm the one to blame.

349
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,080
No, Irene, it's not your fault.

350
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,245
Blame society, as it allows
such horrors to happen.

351
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:25,562
What's society role in this ?

352
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:31,364
A children whose first impressions
of the world around him...

353
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:35,195
..were fear, bombings, war...

354
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:38,045
Who's to blame ?

355
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:41,762
Why should children be the ones who pay ?

356
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:45,004
It isn't right.
Then, God isn't right.

357
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:48,084
Think about this:
maybe a children must die...

358
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:52,086
..because parents can't afford
the needed medicine.

359
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:56,200
It happened today,
at the newspaper:...

360
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:01,196
..a mother came to beg us to do
something to help her.

361
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:05,684
She has four childs, her husband
is a miser and cleans the streets,...

362
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:08,287
..he earns just about enough
to buy food.

363
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:12,798
The medicine costs so much, it's
a new product, made in America.

364
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,645
Is it possible for the child's life
to be bound...

365
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:18,599
..to the money quantity needed
to buy the medicine ?

366
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:22,162
Why didn't you tell me earlier ?
I can provide the needed amount.

367
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,846
How could we do it ?
We can go there right now.

368
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:27,799
- No, tomorrow will be ok.
- Yes...

369
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:32,045
- We'll go there together, eh ?
- Sure.

370
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:58,101
- Oh, George...
- Where the hell have you been ?

371
00:32:58,147 --> 00:33:01,935
Sorry, but I had to go out.
Didn't the doorman tell you ?

372
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:04,897
Yes, he told me, but you didn't
have to go out like this.

373
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:09,975
I've spent the last hours walking from the
door to the window like a wolf in a cage.

374
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:12,541
Why didn't you tell me you were going out ?

375
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:17,456
I was afraid horrible things
happened to you.

376
00:33:17,507 --> 00:33:24,504
- Do you understand that my nervous
condition... - You're right, I'm sorry.

377
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:28,222
You must be patient with me.

378
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:33,295
At times... I think I'm going crazy.

379
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:37,545
- Can you at least tell me where you've been ?
- I've been with Andrea.

380
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:43,025
- Andrea ? What did you wanted from him ?
- I don't know what I'm doing.

381
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:53,497
I'm unable to explain it, even
to myself.

382
00:33:57,027 --> 00:34:02,021
Irene, you must find the strength...
to keep on living.

383
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:09,338
We are despaired,
let's try to help each other.

384
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:14,256
It will pass, don't worry.
We'll find a way out.

385
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:20,781
We'll find a way out...
together.

386
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:28,657
Nobody could help you,
not even Andrea.

387
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:32,586
You need me
exactly as I need you.

388
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:36,859
Yes, George, everything will be fine.

389
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:59,617
- Excuse me, Where's the third lot ?
- Over there. Come, I'll escort you.

390
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:05,462
- There it is.
- Thank you.

391
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:23,017
Here we are.

392
00:35:38,907 --> 00:35:41,819
- Does Galli family live here?
- Please, get in.

393
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:44,939
I escorted them here.

394
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:48,502
- Please.
- Galli, there's someone for you.

395
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:51,778
- May I ?
- Is it you, Sir ? Good morning !

396
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:55,661
- I brought that stuff.
- Oh, Jesus, thank you ! - Here.

397
00:35:55,707 --> 00:35:59,017
This will be enough for both medicines
and hospital expenses.

398
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:02,537
If you'll need something else in the future,
we'll try to help.

399
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:07,581
Thanks.
Do you see the state we live in ?

400
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:13,020
We are sub-renting
this room. We are six.

401
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:16,980
Without Bruno, the house feels empty.

402
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:22,820
- Well, goodbye. Best wishes.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

403
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:26,542
- Thanks so much.
- Youre' welcome. Have a nice day. - You too.

404
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:32,815
- Is there anyhting for me ? - Yes, doctor,
there's a letter for you. - Thanks.

405
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:37,145
Ah, I was looking for you.

406
00:36:37,187 --> 00:36:40,338
- Mister Pisani,
Mrs. Gerard. - How do you do.

407
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:44,221
- How should I write it?
- I'll think about it. Wait.

408
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,542
Please.

409
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:50,655
Sit down, Irene.

410
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:56,976
So... This must go.
This one, even.

411
00:36:57,027 --> 00:37:01,464
Write : ''The state department
initiative...''

412
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:04,419
''..must be put in relation...''

413
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:08,745
''..with the clear attempt
of american financiary entities...''

414
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:15,101
''..to surpass England
and appropriate Persian oils.''

415
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:20,619
''The english government follows
the U.S. Initiative...''

416
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:24,421
''..with extreme diffidence.''

417
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:28,222
And how should I title it?

418
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:32,260
Write: ''Panic among London finances...''

419
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:34,696
''..for the new U.S. Persian manoeuvre.''

420
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:38,296
- Over two columns ? - No, over three,
in the first page.

421
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:41,020
- Well. Good morning, lady.
- Good morning.

422
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:45,026
- Can you wait a bit ?
- It's better for me to go, I'm tired.

423
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:49,140
- I'm sorry that you have to go on your own.
- Don't worry.

424
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:55,183
Irene, listen to me: don't close yourself
shut in your own pain.

425
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:57,422
Yes.

426
00:37:58,627 --> 00:38:03,985
I was thinking: it's strange how
that people seems resigned.

427
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:08,737
It is our duty to wake them up,
shake them up, give them a conscience.

428
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:12,575
- Or just give them hope. - A conscience,
a conscience. We must help them.

429
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:18,065
- Yes, we must help them.
- Beside us they might learn many things.

430
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:23,784
- Take it. Are you interested ?
It's a good book. - Thanks.

431
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:27,024
Let's have a coffee.

432
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,779
- Mister Casati is calling.
- Ah, Yes.

433
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:44,864
Mom, can you do it, please?

434
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:52,503
Yes ? Ah, the baby
is back home? Is he fine ?

435
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:57,667
Thanks, Andrea. No, don't worry.
I'll go there if you can't.

436
00:38:57,707 --> 00:39:00,460
Sure, I remember which
bus I should take.

437
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:04,216
I'm going today.
Thanks, Andrea. Goodbye.

438
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:14,144
- You're happy, eh ?
- Yes, it's good news.

439
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:20,456
Tell me, Irene: I saw some books,
some magazines around...

440
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:24,739
- What are you planning?
- I'm doing nothing wrong, mom.

441
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:28,541
Listen to me... Give me the knit job.

442
00:39:30,387 --> 00:39:34,426
Do you know that in the States
they arrested all communists ?

443
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:37,937
I understand,
after what happened to you...

444
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:41,457
But to get to the point to
forget who you are...

445
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,943
Do you want to end up in a
concentration camp, in case of war ?

446
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:47,785
Listen to me:
come with me in England.

447
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:50,341
- Mom, please...
- What's this got to do with anything?

448
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:54,266
Listen to me, you who might, mom.
I know what my duties are.

449
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:58,778
But, see, I'm looking for something...
Don't you understand ?

450
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:04,382
Well.

451
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:11,382
Why don't you tell exactly what
you think ? That I've gone crazy !

452
00:40:17,987 --> 00:40:21,616
Don't talk to her like that.
Irene is an intelligent woman.

453
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:24,864
We can't stop her,
we have to meet her halfawy,...

454
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:28,377
..wrap her in warmness and care,
as if she was sick and recovering.

455
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:38,305
- Good morning ! - Good morning !
- Good morning ! How are you ?

456
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:40,941
- Fine, thanks.
- Bruno, come here.

457
00:40:40,987 --> 00:40:44,616
- Look, he's almost fine now,
- Yes !

458
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:48,216
- Thank the lady. - Thank you.
- What do have I got to do with it ?

459
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:51,816
Tell her to thank
all those who helped you !

460
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:56,463
Lady, how about a glass of wine?
It's good, genuine stuff.

461
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:59,544
- I believe it. - Really.
- Please have it, lady.

462
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:02,943
If you wish, I'll introduce you
to many of my good friends.

463
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:06,696
- Mister Manzetti, responsible
of the consultation. - How do you do.

464
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:09,341
- This is another dear friend of mine.
- Lady !

465
00:41:09,387 --> 00:41:13,699
He's now jobless, but he used to
work with the railroad police.

466
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:16,181
- This is my lady.
- How do you do.

467
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:19,617
- Please have a seat !
- Thanks. - Have a seat, Mrs.

468
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:23,137
Be silent now,
Gigetto is going to sing.

469
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:31,859
# Turn and do the wheel... #

470
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:34,899
Since I can't sleep with
all these songs in the air,...

471
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:37,017
..I've come to join the party.

472
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:39,103
Have a seat.

473
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:45,780
# Let my friends
listen to my voice. #

474
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:48,944
She's a prostitute,
she lives around here.

475
00:41:48,987 --> 00:41:52,343
Such things worries those who have
older boys.

476
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:56,175
# Try to go away
and leave us in peace #

477
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:59,264
I got it, I'm going away !

478
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:02,822
- Please !
- Have a seat ! Goodbye!

479
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:07,065
I'm glad that she went away !

480
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:16,905
# Turn and do the wheel... #

481
00:42:16,947 --> 00:42:20,019
- What a voice, eh ?
- He's very good.

482
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:25,221
#The joy of singing naturally. #

483
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:33,463
# We're partying for Brunetto
that got out of the hospital #

484
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:37,500
- Bravo ! - Bravo, Gigetto !

485
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:40,703
Take this !

486
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:45,059
# We're partying for Brunetto... #

487
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:47,541
Sorry,
that's my son training.

488
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:49,976
He's very good,
very promising.

489
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,746
Very promising, but in the meanwhile
he's destroying everyone's ears.

490
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:55,381
- Just another sip !
- It's time to go.

491
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:58,419
- Lady, please !
- No, I must go. Goodbye.

492
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:02,904
- If you really don't want...
- Goodbye. - Thanks.

493
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:06,337
- Goodbye, dear Manzetti.
- Ciao, Bruno.

494
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:09,618
- Happy, eh ?
- Thanks to all of you.

495
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:17,776
Nice peole ! But the baby looked
a little tried.

496
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:22,025
He was always a bit like that,
sick for all these years.

497
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:24,581
But he'll be fine with some further care.

498
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:27,983
I was so moving,
all those calm, simple people...

499
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:30,985
What are you doing ? Stop it !

500
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:33,416
You must go to play to the ball !
Go ahead !

501
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:36,061
I'm not gonna eat your son !
Farewell, blonde !

502
00:43:36,107 --> 00:43:40,339
If you knew how many worries
these boys give us !

503
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:44,855
See, most people here is despaired
for too much misery.

504
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:48,661
In the seventh lot there's a house
with twelve people sleeping in a room.

505
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:51,938
Other houses have five, eight,
one on top of the other !

506
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:55,662
There's everything that's needed
to turn this into an industrial neighoborhhod.

507
00:43:55,707 --> 00:44:00,827
Water, electricity.. There would be work
for everyone. And "Work makes man noble".

508
00:44:00,867 --> 00:44:03,859
Instead they are all farm
and construction workers...

509
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,785
..that find jobs for one or two days
on end in a while.

510
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:09,705
That's what makes them despaired.

511
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:45,546
Amilcare ! Amilcare !
There's a dead man in the river ! Come !

512
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:50,661
Amilcare ! Pietro !
Come here, come back !

513
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:56,823
Run ! Run !

514
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:32,425
Go away! Let us through !

515
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:35,743
Let us through!

516
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:40,738
- Yu can't stay here. Where do you live ?
- Over there. - Let's go.

517
00:45:48,187 --> 00:45:51,384
Come ! Oh... like this !

518
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:55,056
And you... here ! You're so pretty !

519
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,458
Dear...

520
00:46:00,587 --> 00:46:02,976
Run !

521
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:22,704
- What's your name ?
- Arnaldo.

522
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:26,820
- What do you want to be
when you grow up ? - A criminal.

523
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:52,058
('BESAME MUCHO'')

524
00:46:52,107 --> 00:46:56,066
Oh ! Where the hell have you been ?

525
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:59,304
- And the others ? Where are they ?
- They went to the football match.

526
00:46:59,347 --> 00:47:03,863
What did they do? You, blow your nose, come on!

527
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:07,582
Daniela, show your brother how.
Yes! Like this !

528
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:11,063
- Here. Have a seat, lady.
- No, thanks, I don't want to disturb.

529
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:14,144
Don't worry, please !

530
00:47:16,507 --> 00:47:19,658
Sit down here.
Where did you find them ?

531
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:24,337
Along the river's edge,
I stepped in because they...

532
00:47:24,387 --> 00:47:27,060
How many times do I have to tell you
that you can't go there ?

533
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:29,416
Next time I'll beat you !

534
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:31,617
Sorry, but they always make me live
in anxiety !

535
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:34,101
You're older and you should have more care !

536
00:47:34,147 --> 00:47:37,423
- They ran away, I tried catching them...
- You should have called me !

537
00:47:37,467 --> 00:47:40,061
Bring him home
and go call yuor brothers.

538
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:44,942
No, wait, let's give him some bread and
cheese too.

539
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:49,856
Isn't this child beautiful?
I'd steal him from my mother !

540
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:53,456
Here, dear! Have a kiss !

541
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:57,420
Come on, bring him away and call
your brothers ! Tell them to come soon !

542
00:47:57,467 --> 00:48:01,142
- He's beautiful, eh ? - Yes, very much.
How many child have you got ?

543
00:48:01,187 --> 00:48:03,860
- Six. - Six ?!
- They aren't all mine.

544
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:08,298
- Three are. The other three
I've found them around. - How ?

545
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:11,942
Found. How do you say ? They were
orphans and I took them with me.

546
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:16,936
- You like children !
- I'm crazy for them !

547
00:48:16,987 --> 00:48:20,263
I understand. Childrens are beautiful.

548
00:48:20,307 --> 00:48:24,300
You can't understand, but
I have fun with them, that's what.

549
00:48:24,347 --> 00:48:27,623
Look at the state of yours !
Here's the bread !

550
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:33,378
Take your sandwich, Daniela !
Now go play outside !

551
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:37,306
Go, dear, go ! Outside !

552
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,657
Come to your mom, dear Daniela !

553
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:44,143
- Look at her eyes ! Show your teeth
to the lady ! - She's beautiful !

554
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:48,544
She has the same eyes as her
criminal father !

555
00:48:48,587 --> 00:48:52,375
- Where is he ?
- Gone. - Is he dead ?

556
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:57,740
Dead ? No, I hope not !
Why, poor him ?

557
00:48:57,787 --> 00:49:01,336
You said: ''Gone''
and I thought...

558
00:49:01,387 --> 00:49:04,140
- No, no. Do you want some ricotta ?
- No, thanks.

559
00:49:04,187 --> 00:49:06,781
Don't be shy, take some !

560
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,820
- Are you separated ?
- You don't understand.

561
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:13,586
I was in Capranica
for the grain harvesting season.

562
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:15,857
I met him there,
and you know how these things goes...

563
00:49:15,907 --> 00:49:19,456
- Then he... - He stayed there.
- Did he leave you ?

564
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:23,944
No, he's a very good man !
But I'm a crazy woman !

565
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:27,980
I know myself, you know ?
I don't want to be a pain to men.

566
00:49:28,027 --> 00:49:29,779
Men are like babies.

567
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:33,422
You have to submit because
they believe they are who knows what !

568
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:37,938
They always play, and all they can do is
making love, if you teach them.

569
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:42,105
- Babies instead...
- Oh, I like babies, instead !

570
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:44,866
And they bring on the Divine Providence !

571
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:48,024
Hey, is this the way to step in ?!

572
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:51,582
Say hello to Mom's
friend. How do you say?

573
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:55,302
- Good morning. - This is Bruno,
this is Luciano, this is Gabriella.

574
00:49:55,347 --> 00:50:00,899
- Good morning. - Come here to your
mommy, I'm gonna feed you with my kisses !

575
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:04,863
Holy Smoke, I left the soup
overcooking !

576
00:50:04,907 --> 00:50:08,741
It's boiling since a couple of hours !
Get the table ready ! I'm so distracted!

577
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:13,581
Help me, rinse it, but do it well !

578
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:17,738
- She doesn't look italian.
Is she german ? - No...

579
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:22,144
- Is she from the IRO ? - What ?
- Is she from the exiles camp ?

580
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:26,897
- Yes... - I had a friend that came from there.
She worked in a circus.

581
00:50:26,947 --> 00:50:29,905
Ah, here it is !

582
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:34,461
If you need something,
just ask.

583
00:50:34,507 --> 00:50:39,103
Are you ready, Gabriella ?
I'm gonna get you dry !

584
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:44,460
Come to your mommy ! Like this !

585
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:51,026
C'mon ! Fly, fly, fly !

586
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:54,742
Stand up !
And you, pull your shorts up !

587
00:50:55,212 --> 00:50:59,204
Quick, or we'll be late
to the cinema !

588
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:03,577
George !

589
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,142
I discovered a world I didn't know
it existed ! I'm shocked!

590
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:10,418
You must try to feed
and to rest  properly.

591
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:14,619
- I don't want to see you like this anymore.
Promise me. - Yes, don't worry.

592
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:17,101
I want to see you strong and calm.

593
00:51:17,147 --> 00:51:22,744
In these last days I have discovered
and understood many new things.

594
00:51:22,787 --> 00:51:26,223
I'll hold on to everything I can
in order to forget.

595
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:30,146
I know, dear.
You must do whatever you wish.

596
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:41,022
Irene ! Finally !

597
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:43,217
- How are you, Andrea ?
- Nice to see you !

598
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,417
- I need you.
- What's up? Tell me.

599
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:48,061
I met a young woman,
with six childs.

600
00:51:48,107 --> 00:51:52,066
She's brave, strong,
calm and intelligent.

601
00:51:52,107 --> 00:51:56,703
She's always able to make it. No luxuries
and no frills, as she says.

602
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,738
She needs a job,
any kind of job.

603
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:02,700
I think having a job might
fully satisfy her.

604
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:05,705
Well, I'll do everything I can
in order to have you satisified.

605
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,819
I'm so happy hearing you
talking like this !

606
00:52:08,867 --> 00:52:12,906
Do you remember when you first
arrived in Italy ?

607
00:52:12,947 --> 00:52:16,542
It was in... '47, no ?

608
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:20,466
Many things happened since
and many things changed.

609
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:24,500
It was one of the best periods
of my life.

610
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:29,496
There was so much enthusiasm
and we were always together.

611
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:33,256
Dear Irene, I would really
like to help you.

612
00:52:33,307 --> 00:52:37,585
And you always knew, Irene,
my feelings for you.

613
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:47,861
I'll take care of your protegee.
You'll give me her name and address.

614
00:52:47,907 --> 00:52:50,979
Is she working now ?

615
00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:58,058
No. She just defends herself. She tries
to help, she invents hundreds of things.

616
00:52:58,107 --> 00:53:01,861
She's full of dignity, full of life,...

617
00:53:01,907 --> 00:53:05,502
..and she has this great desire
of finding a job.

618
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:08,505
But her quest is a bit vague
and uncertain.

619
00:53:08,547 --> 00:53:12,540
And so I, with my cool
northern blood,...

620
00:53:12,587 --> 00:53:17,707
..I'm struggling to find a job for her.

621
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:22,263
It's called a conscience,
a class conscience.

622
00:53:22,307 --> 00:53:26,744
You don't know how important it is
what you've tried to do.

623
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,778
Do you think about it?

624
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:33,457
A day will come when men
will have absolute faith...

625
00:53:33,507 --> 00:53:38,979
..in an uninterrupted progress,
that might make them...

626
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:44,465
..masters of the laws of
the universe, masters of life...

627
00:53:44,507 --> 00:53:51,060
It will be paradise, the paradise
of man, wanted by men.

628
00:53:51,107 --> 00:53:54,338
The true paradise.

629
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:59,258
- Good morning !
- Good morning ! - Oh, you're having lunch !

630
00:53:59,307 --> 00:54:02,583
- No, we're done.
How are you ? - Fine.

631
00:54:02,627 --> 00:54:05,744
I'm a bit late,
I've been very busy!

632
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:10,099
They ate three kilos of bread
while waiting for the soup !

633
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:15,619
- Have a seat ! - Maria, come here !
- Go out ! I have to tidy a bit !

634
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:19,057
Maria, help Daniela
getting down from the seat.

635
00:54:19,107 --> 00:54:24,386
- Be comfortable, Mrs. May
I offer you anything ? - No, thanks.

636
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,464
- A coffee ? A glass of liquor ?
- I've found a job for you.

637
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:32,103
- Really ? - On wednesday.
- Oh, the chance !

638
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:36,060
- Now that I've found a job,
such a thing happens... - What ?

639
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:41,181
See, I met a boy, he was working
here, at the bakery.

640
00:54:41,227 --> 00:54:45,664
- You, go away !
- No, mom ! - Air ! Air !

641
00:54:45,707 --> 00:54:52,579
A small man, with so beautiful
eyes ! A true wonder !

642
00:54:52,627 --> 00:54:57,655
He got called back by the Army.
They sent him to Turin, with the Artillery.

643
00:54:57,707 --> 00:55:03,020
- Well, you know how it goes...
- No, how does it go ? - Wait.

644
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:09,546
He wrote me they are going to send him
to Bracciano for a couple of days...

645
00:55:09,587 --> 00:55:12,226
..to retrieve the flour
for his battalion.

646
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,339
He can't stop in Rome,
He has to leave immediately,...

647
00:55:15,387 --> 00:55:17,981
..and I would like to go
and visit him.

648
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:20,666
I'm entitled
to it, aint' I ?

649
00:55:20,707 --> 00:55:25,383
Sure, none's gonna stop you,
but you'll lose the job !

650
00:55:25,427 --> 00:55:28,100
I should find a remedy
for that:...

651
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:33,096
..someone should go to the
factory instead of me.

652
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:29,823
George, I'm starting to worry.
Shouldn't we do something ?

653
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:33,542
- There's no reason, she knows
very well we're going to the theatre - Thanks.

654
00:59:33,587 --> 00:59:37,626
I don't know, I don't
understand her anymore.

655
00:59:47,507 --> 00:59:51,898
Oh, finally!
What happened ? It's so late !

656
00:59:51,947 --> 00:59:56,338
- Sorry... - We won't make it
to the theatre in time.

657
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:59,823
- Good evening. - If you don't rush,
we'll lose the first act.

658
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:03,746
I'm so sorry,
It's late and...

659
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:08,182
- Oh, Irene ! - You knew
they were coming, didn't you ?

660
01:00:08,227 --> 01:00:13,347
Yes, I did. I forgot all about it.
I hope you will excuse me.

661
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:16,463
May I ?

662
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:22,862
- So ?
- Oh, George...

663
01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:24,943
How long should we keep
playing this comedy ?

664
01:00:24,987 --> 01:00:28,343
Sorry. It will end soon.
Just be patient.

665
01:00:28,387 --> 01:00:32,141
No, I have to explain !
I've put up with everything !

666
01:00:32,187 --> 01:00:34,655
I justified
your behaviours,...

667
01:00:34,707 --> 01:00:37,744
..I defended you against your mother,
against your cousin, against everybody !

668
01:00:37,787 --> 01:00:40,699
I said yes to whatever
you told me, but not anymore !

669
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:43,307
Everything it's perfectly clear now !

670
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:46,657
Everything you do is a rehearsal,
even your way of dressing !

671
01:00:46,707 --> 01:00:52,703
- You got like this
in order to be liked by him ! - Oh, George...

672
01:00:52,747 --> 01:00:57,184
Those men are masterful when it
comes to conquer troubled souls !

673
01:00:58,907 --> 01:01:05,380
Why do you avoid me ?
You're afraid of even being touched by me ?

674
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:10,785
If you're in love with Andrea,
why aren't you brave enough to say so ?

675
01:01:10,827 --> 01:01:13,136
It's not honourable for you
to try and deceive me !

676
01:01:13,187 --> 01:01:15,940
For a long time I thought
It was just about Michel,...

677
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:18,296
..but now I know it had
only been an excuse !

678
01:01:18,347 --> 01:01:21,384
- What are you talking about ?
- Ah, stop, stop, stop !

679
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:25,181
Oh, no, George ! No !

680
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,502
- Shut up, stop it !
- George...

681
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:30,778
Stop it, if you don't want
me to throw a scandal, tonight !

682
01:01:30,827 --> 01:01:33,864
- Don't you dare
saying a single word ! - You're wrong if...

683
01:01:33,907 --> 01:01:37,695
Stop it !
Don't make me lose control !

684
01:01:37,747 --> 01:01:41,422
I don't want to drive you crazy,
but you have to listen.

685
01:01:41,467 --> 01:01:43,935
STOP !

686
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:49,059
- Stop !
- George...

687
01:01:56,947 --> 01:02:00,986
I had to feel it, see it,
this job! And I'm terrified !

688
01:02:01,027 --> 01:02:04,463
I know, it's an horrendous
condemnation !

689
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:07,704
Come on, Irene, ease up a bit
and do not exaggerate.

690
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:13,299
Belive me, Andrea, I'm not exaggerating.
I saw very well what's it all about.

691
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:16,827
And to think they want to raise work
to a godlike status !

692
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:20,985
Don't you suspect you're being
a victim of your first impressions ?

693
01:02:21,027 --> 01:02:25,305
What did you see about work ?
How's the true work life ?

694
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:27,577
You saw
the slavery of work,...

695
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:30,619
..but when we'll have
a full working humanity...

696
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:34,262
The one you dream about
is a monstrous humanity !

697
01:02:34,307 --> 01:02:37,060
I saw them !
They're just slaves in chains !

698
01:02:37,107 --> 01:02:39,223
How could you think
they would be happier ?

699
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:44,944
At least they would be less unhappy
and there would be more justice.

700
01:02:44,987 --> 01:02:48,821
And nobody will die from fatigue anymore...

701
01:02:48,867 --> 01:02:52,985
..while others are sitting still
watching him.

702
01:02:53,027 --> 01:02:57,100
It might even be true,
but if everybody would understand...

703
01:02:57,147 --> 01:03:01,982
..that work is not just a duty,
but a condemnation...

704
01:03:02,027 --> 01:03:06,976
''You'll earn your bread
by the sweat of your forehead.''

705
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:11,305
Then, probably,
we'll feel closer,...

706
01:03:11,347 --> 01:03:14,783
..equal, humiliated
in the same way,...

707
01:03:14,827 --> 01:03:17,660
..and we'll search for salvation together.

708
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:20,858
But I thank you, Andrea,
after all, it was you that brought me to this point.

709
01:03:20,907 --> 01:03:26,664
I know I've been wrong all my life
and there's so little time...

710
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:29,699
Oh, Michel !

711
01:03:29,747 --> 01:03:34,616
I want to be certain that he knows
how great is my love for everyone.

712
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:37,306
And this love belongs to him!

713
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:41,659
I'm sure that, if he could
see his mother...

714
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:44,505
It might be a tender illusion,...

715
01:03:44,547 --> 01:03:48,699
..but trying to strive,
to see this... How should I call it ?

716
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:52,626
This heaven on earth more
concretely, I assure you that...

717
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:59,220
No, Andrea. I would like to have
a faith, an impregnable faith.

718
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:03,658
In this heaven on earth
there would be no place for Michel,...

719
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:06,426
..for he isn't alive anymore.

720
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:13,179
The paradise I dream about it's not just
for the living, but for everyone.

721
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:18,142
It's eternal.
This is my paradise.

722
01:07:35,507 --> 01:07:38,499
Dera, don't let her run !

723
01:07:38,547 --> 01:07:42,460
Stop it,
you idiot ! Shut up!

724
01:07:43,907 --> 01:07:47,980
- What are you doing here ?
- Nothing, just passing.

725
01:07:48,027 --> 01:07:50,780
They drove me crazy !

726
01:07:50,827 --> 01:07:54,263
I'm feverish and can't stand on my feet !
I'm extremely cold !

727
01:07:54,307 --> 01:07:56,457
Why don't you go home ?

728
01:07:56,507 --> 01:08:01,501
I can't afford the night bus,
I have to wait for the tram.

729
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:05,222
- Don't worry, I'll escort you.
- Are you showing compassion ?

730
01:08:05,267 --> 01:08:09,499
No, I'm going to the
neighborhood as well. Come.

731
01:08:14,947 --> 01:08:18,576
- Bye, beauty ! Have a good trip !
-Go fuck yourself !

732
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:23,018
Farewell, goldilocks!
Say hello to Primavalle !

733
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:39,416
I feel so sick ! What do you
come here for ?

734
01:08:39,467 --> 01:08:43,779
- I have to see someone.
- Who ? And at such an hour ?

735
01:08:45,547 --> 01:08:50,143
I don't know why, everybody
lies to me.

736
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:35,857
Where's the key ?

737
01:10:02,947 --> 01:10:06,337
Where can I find a doctor ?

738
01:10:06,387 --> 01:10:10,300
How should I know ?
Go outside, ask someone.

739
01:10:10,347 --> 01:10:13,066
How could I tell you
where a doctor is to be found ?

740
01:10:47,347 --> 01:10:49,099
Where can I find a doctor ?

741
01:10:49,147 --> 01:10:52,378
I don't know. There's a chemist shop,
not that far from here.

742
01:10:52,427 --> 01:10:54,941
- Where is it ?
- This way.

743
01:10:57,267 --> 01:11:00,020
This lady needs a doctor

744
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:03,025
Yes, it's for a very sick woman.

745
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:07,618
Right now ? It's very late.
Anyway, let's try making a call.

746
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:17,824
It's near enough. Thanks.

747
01:11:21,587 --> 01:11:24,306
- I don't want to go to the hospital.
- No, no...

748
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:28,386
- I want to stay at my place.
- Yes, your place, no hospital.

749
01:11:28,987 --> 01:11:31,626
Do not breathe.

750
01:11:35,107 --> 01:11:38,656
- I don't want to go to the hospital.
- OK.

751
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:41,460
I want to stay at my place..

752
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:48,497
- So ? - She's "gone". I'd send
her straight to the hospital.

753
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:53,575
No, doctor, why give her this pain?
Isn't there any hope ?

754
01:11:53,627 --> 01:11:58,576
<i>What do you want ? Two, three, four
days, a week... And then, amen.</i>

755
01:11:58,627 --> 01:12:01,095
- Is there nothing we can do ?
- Nothing.

756
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:03,536
Two years ago one could have,
cured her, maybe.

757
01:12:03,587 --> 01:12:06,897
But the sickness is in its last
stages... It took both lungs.

758
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:09,905
Unfortunately we can just
wait for the end.

759
01:12:09,947 --> 01:12:12,415
Goodbye. Thank you.

760
01:12:28,727 --> 01:12:32,163
Oh, my God,
I feel so weak...

761
01:12:32,207 --> 01:12:36,485
My God, I feel so weak...

762
01:12:36,527 --> 01:12:41,840
- Yes ? - Open the window,
call Alfonso, he's in the bar.

763
01:12:41,887 --> 01:12:47,405
Tell him two bring two eggs
and a cappuccino. They're nutritious.

764
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:50,645
- And a fried pastry.
- Yes, immediately.

765
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:54,885
No, from the window.
- It'll be faster this way.

766
01:13:01,207 --> 01:13:03,277
- Good morning !
- Good morning !

767
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:06,524
- Did you go to our place ?
- No, to Ines's, she's very sick.

768
01:13:06,567 --> 01:13:11,721
- She's just a comedian !
- This time she's very sick.

769
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:14,884
- Can I help you ?
- No, thanks, I was going to the bar.

770
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:17,361
- He will go !
- Ah, well.

771
01:13:17,407 --> 01:13:22,117
Bring her two eggs shaken in milk
and coffee and a fried pastry.

772
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:25,796
- Go! Run !
- Thanks! How is your wife doing ?

773
01:13:25,847 --> 01:13:30,204
- Always the same.
Goodbye, Mrs. - Goodbye.

774
01:13:35,967 --> 01:13:39,277
- He's coming. - Oh my God, the fox furs!
I can't see my fox furs !

775
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,843
Look in the wardrobe for my fox furs.
They steal everything here.

776
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:48,039
You mean these?

777
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,835
- Hello beauty, how are you ?
- What a cold hand !

778
01:14:04,887 --> 01:14:07,799
This is warm !
Who is she ?

779
01:14:07,847 --> 01:14:10,839
- Go away, I'm sick !
- Goodbye.

780
01:14:10,887 --> 01:14:15,199
- How much do I owe you ?
- Don't worry, nobody ever pays here.

781
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:26,519
He's such a rude man...

782
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:37,476
He's at it again!
He's driving me crazy ! Stop !

783
01:14:37,527 --> 01:14:41,440
- I'll go there.
- Yes, please, he's driving me crazy !

784
01:14:43,887 --> 01:14:46,481
Good evening, how are you ?
Still feverish ?

785
01:14:46,527 --> 01:14:49,963
No, luckily. Anything new ?

786
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:54,119
Nothing. We found no traces.

787
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:57,716
- And what about Andrea ?
- Nothing.

788
01:14:57,767 --> 01:15:00,600
He was followed, all his moves
were controlled.

789
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:03,605
That investigator did everything
he could, to no avail.

790
01:15:03,647 --> 01:15:08,118
My God, I'm so worried !
Irene was completely bewildered !

791
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:12,319
I imagined the most terrible things.
Ten days went by.

792
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:16,599
Don't worry too much, I'm sure
we'll know something about it soon.

793
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:59,762
Go, now.

794
01:16:16,647 --> 01:16:20,799
- It's so late. Go, if you must.
- No, I don't care.

795
01:16:22,087 --> 01:16:26,399
Maybe I'm gonna heat the soup
and come back soon.

796
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:47,605
Heavy robbery in Trastevere !
One dead and one wounded !

797
01:16:47,647 --> 01:16:51,526
Bandits ran away on a grey car !

798
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:53,797
Heavy robbery in Trastevere !

799
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:31,077
Open, come on.

800
01:18:34,807 --> 01:18:38,516
Lady, Ines is dead.

801
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:42,162
- Come on !
- What's going on ?

802
01:18:42,207 --> 01:18:45,085
- Tell her, if you're brave enough !
- Stop it !

803
01:18:45,127 --> 01:18:49,962
He's a killer !
Our son is a killer !

804
01:18:50,007 --> 01:18:52,475
His friends ruined him !

805
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:56,361
They wanted to rob a bank !
They harmed a man ! One died !

806
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:59,479
Shut up, all of you !

807
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:04,476
- Why do you act like this with your parents?
- You, shut up !

808
01:19:04,527 --> 01:19:07,917
They are your parents !

809
01:19:07,967 --> 01:19:11,198
- Where's Remo ?
- He's calling the police !

810
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:16,002
Damn! I can't take it anymore !
Be careful or I'll kill you !

811
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:20,643
Don't move ! Stop it !
Run away ! Run !

812
01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:23,838
Give me the gun! Think about what
you're doing! Let them arrest you !

813
01:19:23,887 --> 01:19:28,165
Your conscience will ease !
You'll go, I'm sure ! Quick !

814
01:19:28,207 --> 01:19:32,120
It's the only way you have to save
yourself! Try to understand!

815
01:19:45,567 --> 01:19:50,083
- There. - Did the car go to get
the doctor? - Half an hour ago.

816
01:19:57,727 --> 01:20:02,198
The doctor is already here. Come on,
lady, quick, he wants to see you.

817
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:08,003
So, you admit you helped
Puglisi Ferdinando to escape,...

818
01:20:08,047 --> 01:20:10,515
..when you heard that police...

819
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:12,762
Yes.

820
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:15,799
Then all I have to do is sending
your file to judgemental autohority...

821
01:20:15,847 --> 01:20:18,520
..and send you to''Le Mantellate''.

822
01:20:18,567 --> 01:20:22,845
- What's ''Le Mantellate'' ?
- The female prison !

823
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:28,962
Can you tell why
you helped him escape?

824
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:31,919
- Sure.
- Then tell me !

825
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:38,201
He was so terrified, he might
have been capable of anything...

826
01:20:38,247 --> 01:20:41,478
..to kill, or be killed...

827
01:20:41,527 --> 01:20:45,042
- So you helped him escape.
- Yes.

828
01:20:45,087 --> 01:20:48,045
It's a crime.
Clear, isn't it?

829
01:20:48,087 --> 01:20:53,161
I'm sure the boy will come to be
arrested spontaneously..

830
01:20:53,207 --> 01:20:56,802
He's a poor man. He'll admit his crime.

831
01:20:58,007 --> 01:21:02,478
Tell me: if you are
what you say you are...

832
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:05,644
Careful, as we're going to
investigate further, you know?

833
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:07,882
Why did you leave your husband ?

834
01:21:07,927 --> 01:21:10,282
Why did you go to live
with a woman...

835
01:21:10,327 --> 01:21:14,286
How do you say? A bad woman ?

836
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,921
Even she was a poor creature.

837
01:21:16,967 --> 01:21:19,879
Yes, sure, but explain it better, please.

838
01:21:19,927 --> 01:21:23,681
It's a long story.

839
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:28,364
And maybe I don't even know it.

840
01:21:28,407 --> 01:21:32,366
Maybe I might
explain you why.

841
01:21:32,407 --> 01:21:38,846
Yes? It's me, speaking.

842
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:43,722
Ah, well ! can you send him here ?
Did you interrogate him yet ?

843
01:21:43,767 --> 01:21:46,201
Good, thank you.

844
01:21:48,247 --> 01:21:53,321
So, Puglisi went in
at the central.

845
01:22:10,576 --> 01:22:15,691
<i>A mysterious woman
helps robber escape</i>

846
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:20,763
- Have a seat.
- Dear doctor !

847
01:22:20,807 --> 01:22:23,685
- Good morning, lawyer.
- Mister Gerard.

848
01:22:23,727 --> 01:22:25,922
- How do you do.
- Have a seat.

849
01:22:28,847 --> 01:22:32,840
- Did you have time to study her case ?
- Yes, sure.

850
01:22:32,887 --> 01:22:36,721
On the newspapers somebody insinuated that...

851
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:42,125
..there was a relationship of sort
between the lady and the boy. What a shame.

852
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:47,195
I guess that after the boy
spontaneously went to the police,...

853
01:22:47,247 --> 01:22:51,559
..all of this thing just lost
its monumentum.

854
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:55,725
-Go on.
- But there's another aspect.

855
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:59,521
The social position of the lady
and her family.

856
01:22:59,567 --> 01:23:04,561
As I told you earlier, after the
death of her child, the lady...

857
01:23:04,607 --> 01:23:10,637
How can I say ? She lost herself,
she did some strange things.

858
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:16,120
Keep in mind Mister Gerard's
position in Rome.

859
01:23:16,807 --> 01:23:19,120
He's the representative of one of
the most famous american brands.

860
01:23:19,887 --> 01:23:23,960
Him, the lady's mother coming
from America, the family,...

861
01:23:24,007 --> 01:23:27,283
..they did everything they could
to help her...

862
01:23:27,327 --> 01:23:30,558
..up until she, of her
own volition,...

863
01:23:30,607 --> 01:23:33,360
..abandoned her husband.

864
01:23:33,407 --> 01:23:37,195
Is it true that since she went away,
you had no news form her...

865
01:23:37,247 --> 01:23:40,762
..up until today, when you read
about this on the newspaper ?

866
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:46,916
- Yes, it's true. - Didn't you think
about the idea I told you earlier ?

867
01:23:46,967 --> 01:23:51,279
The hypotesis of putting the lady
in a psychiatric hospital...

868
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:53,477
..for a period of observation ?

869
01:23:53,527 --> 01:23:56,280
Yes. I alerted the authorities
about that.

870
01:23:56,327 --> 01:24:02,641
I believe it all falls under
the realm of prevention, on your side...

871
01:24:02,687 --> 01:24:05,326
..and in the interest
of lady Gerard.

872
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:12,955
Maybe then we'll have the chance
to ease this scandal a bit.

873
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:24,482
Why should I get visited ?

874
01:24:24,527 --> 01:24:28,156
- because the doctor advised you to.
- But I'm fine !

875
01:24:28,207 --> 01:24:34,157
I know. Don't talk now, please,
try to stay calm.

876
01:24:53,227 --> 01:24:56,264
- Gerard.
- There, at the end of the road.

877
01:25:38,627 --> 01:25:41,300
Good morning. Have a seat.

878
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:53,099
Come, lady. One moment, please.

879
01:25:59,267 --> 01:26:02,339
I'll soon be there,
don't worry.

880
01:26:07,627 --> 01:26:09,618
Come, lady, come.

881
01:26:11,827 --> 01:26:14,625
- And my husband ?
- He'll reach you in a while.

882
01:26:43,107 --> 01:26:45,302
Help yourself in, please.

883
01:26:47,087 --> 01:26:49,157
Please.

884
01:26:50,687 --> 01:26:53,963
- Is my husband not coming ?
- He'll come, don't worry.

885
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:57,079
- Is this my room ?
- Yes.

886
01:27:30,927 --> 01:27:35,637
Lady, I brought you a room vest
and the toilet essentials.

887
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:40,317
If you let me know what you need...
I'll do everything you need.

888
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:45,760
Cesira, don't act like a child,
i'm perfectly fine.

889
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:50,403
And I'm counting on you
for the house to run smoothly.

890
01:27:50,447 --> 01:27:55,805
Oh, lady, why is this happening !
You've always been a good woman !

891
01:27:55,847 --> 01:27:58,964
They didn't have to
close you in here !

892
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:04,525
Cesira, don't cry.
See, I'm fine enough, here.

893
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:08,276
Maybe it will be good for me
to be alone with myself, isolated.

894
01:28:08,327 --> 01:28:14,004
I'm calm here. Don't think
that somebody harmed me.

895
01:28:14,047 --> 01:28:18,120
Now that I'm not at home anymore, I'm
trusting you for everything to run smoothly...

896
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:21,876
..and that Mr. Gerard might
have everything he needs.

897
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:24,043
Cesira, may I trust you ?

898
01:28:24,087 --> 01:28:27,966
Yes, sure !
Oh, Lady !

899
01:30:09,687 --> 01:30:12,997
- Where are you taking me?
- The doctor wants to see you. Come.

900
01:30:16,927 --> 01:30:20,602
Everything is normal.
Try to flash it.

901
01:30:32,767 --> 01:30:34,678
Increase !

902
01:30:40,367 --> 01:30:42,562
Increase !

903
01:30:44,567 --> 01:30:46,956
Back to 4 !

904
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:51,523
Stop.

905
01:30:51,567 --> 01:30:56,357
I'll show you some inkblot cards.

906
01:30:56,407 --> 01:31:00,685
Please tell me whatever comes through
your mind, when you see them.

907
01:31:00,727 --> 01:31:03,161
It's vital that you
collaborate actively...

908
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:07,166
..and please try to give me
as many answers as you can.

909
01:31:07,207 --> 01:31:11,485
Also, do not omit anything
that comes through your mind.

910
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:25,561
- But this... I don't know, it's nothing.
- What do you mean with "nothing", lady ?

911
01:31:25,607 --> 01:31:31,443
A fierce jumping beast.
A totem.

912
01:31:31,487 --> 01:31:35,844
- And then ?
- A vertebrae.

913
01:31:43,687 --> 01:31:46,838
A bat.
Yes, probably a bat.

914
01:31:51,367 --> 01:31:54,723
Nothing.

915
01:31:55,847 --> 01:31:58,645
Nothing. I don't know.

916
01:32:02,327 --> 01:32:07,606
They're just blots.
I don't know what to say.

917
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:13,085
It's so ridiculous.
I don't know how to reply.

918
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:16,483
Please, stop it,
it's really ridiculous.

919
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:22,645
Something happened
to me and I can't solve it.

920
01:32:22,687 --> 01:32:27,841
I would like
a word of advice.

921
01:32:27,887 --> 01:32:31,004
- Good morning, reverend.
- Good morning.

922
01:32:31,047 --> 01:32:33,402
So if I...

923
01:32:33,447 --> 01:32:37,520
- But I must talk to the father !
- Stay calm.

924
01:32:37,567 --> 01:32:40,639
- It's important.
- We'll talk later. I'm staying.

925
01:32:42,247 --> 01:32:45,398
- Is that the new patient,
Mrs. Gerard ? - Yes.

926
01:32:45,447 --> 01:32:49,725
- May I speak to her ?
- Sure. Go on, please.

927
01:33:02,887 --> 01:33:04,957
- What do you want from me ?!
- What's up ?

928
01:33:05,007 --> 01:33:08,920
- I don't want anything to do with you!
Who are you?! - Don't you know me ?

929
01:33:19,567 --> 01:33:25,403
- Good morning. - Good morning.
- How are you ? - Fine, thanks.

930
01:33:25,447 --> 01:33:29,759
I would like to talk to you.
Nobody told me to do it.

931
01:33:31,587 --> 01:33:34,499
I met your husband.

932
01:33:35,267 --> 01:33:39,658
You know, he comes everyday
to have news about you.

933
01:33:39,707 --> 01:33:43,541
We spoke for long, it was
really enlightening.

934
01:33:43,587 --> 01:33:48,138
- So, I thought of visiting you.
- Yes...

935
01:33:48,187 --> 01:33:52,977
In our clerical practice we learn
to understand many things.

936
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:57,703
Don't think I want to judge you
for leaving your home,...

937
01:33:57,747 --> 01:34:01,137
..or for being interested
in another man.

938
01:34:01,187 --> 01:34:03,906
No, you are wrong.

939
01:34:03,947 --> 01:34:08,179
I know my husband believed it,
but it isn't true.

940
01:34:08,227 --> 01:34:12,778
Let me explain:
there comes a time when...

941
01:34:12,827 --> 01:34:16,376
..love for our dearest ones
is not enough anymore.

942
01:34:16,427 --> 01:34:22,775
I felt it was too selfish,
shabby.

943
01:34:22,827 --> 01:34:26,217
And i felt compelled to get
close to the others,...

944
01:34:26,267 --> 01:34:28,827
..the humbles, any of the humbles,
and love them.

945
01:34:28,867 --> 01:34:33,304
This goes to prove yours is a christian feeling.

946
01:34:33,347 --> 01:34:37,659
Anyway, even love has rules that
need to be respected.

947
01:34:37,707 --> 01:34:40,665
Surely you ain't sure you need
to abandon your husband...

948
01:34:40,707 --> 01:34:43,016
..for the sake of a feeling,
as vast as it might be.

949
01:34:43,067 --> 01:34:47,060
We must do good, but carefully,
as God's will dictates.

950
01:34:47,107 --> 01:34:49,462
No, love has no measures.

951
01:34:49,507 --> 01:34:52,817
Evil sprouts from the fact that
we don't give all our love...

952
01:34:52,867 --> 01:34:55,825
..to those who mostly need it.

953
01:34:55,867 --> 01:35:00,702
We must love them for what they are
and help them the best we can.

954
01:35:00,747 --> 01:35:04,296
God created us as such.

955
01:35:04,347 --> 01:35:08,056
How sad it is to be suddenly aware
that in life...

956
01:35:08,107 --> 01:35:11,338
..we have been deserters towards
others and towards ourselves.

957
01:35:11,387 --> 01:35:15,380
So you would like to...
be a reformer.

958
01:35:15,427 --> 01:35:21,059
Did you think about it? Do you
you think you could have such a strength?

959
01:35:21,107 --> 01:35:23,177
I don't know.

960
01:35:23,227 --> 01:35:28,585
All I know is that I've been, and
still am, too selfish.

961
01:35:28,627 --> 01:35:33,382
I try to give others all the love
I have. Which isn't mine.

962
01:35:36,227 --> 01:35:42,382
Only then a great light
descends within me.

963
01:35:42,427 --> 01:35:48,821
An immense good possesses me
without me invoking it.

964
01:35:48,867 --> 01:35:54,066
Just then mountains could
really be moved.

965
01:35:54,107 --> 01:35:58,100
Do you firmly believe
in God and his own Grace ?

966
01:35:59,387 --> 01:36:03,426
What I know is that we need to
live full of love for everyone else.

967
01:36:03,467 --> 01:36:06,823
What matters is that men might
save themselves,...

968
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:10,576
..that the whole world might.

969
01:36:11,227 --> 01:36:16,460
''I came not on earth to lose sinners,
but to save them''

970
01:36:16,507 --> 01:36:20,102
This is the miracle
of Christianity.

971
01:36:20,147 --> 01:36:26,700
Where did you read those things ?
Who told them to you ?

972
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:30,740
- Nobody.
- These are words from the Gospels.

973
01:36:30,787 --> 01:36:35,417
I've been a sinner myself.
I... am in turmoil.

974
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:37,886
Aren't you afraid of the
life you are choosing ?

975
01:36:37,627 --> 01:36:40,539
Why should I be afraid?

976
01:37:06,427 --> 01:37:09,180
- Ester ! Maria ! Help !
- What happened ?!

977
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:20,357
Wait !

978
01:38:09,927 --> 01:38:17,003
You're not alone.
Stay calm. I'll be with you.

979
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:24,921
I'm here with you.

980
01:38:32,207 --> 01:38:36,997
- May I ? Good morning, Lady.
- Good morning. - You may go.

981
01:38:37,047 --> 01:38:42,565
How are you ?
Do you feel fine here ?

982
01:38:44,527 --> 01:38:48,122
Is there something we might
do for you ?

983
01:38:50,487 --> 01:38:53,365
See, in here we like to...

984
01:38:53,407 --> 01:38:58,117
..establish calm and serene
relationships.

985
01:38:59,007 --> 01:39:01,965
I know what happened
earlier today.

986
01:39:02,007 --> 01:39:06,478
That poor woman attempted
suicide... An unfortunate thing.

987
01:39:06,527 --> 01:39:11,396
Despite the most severe precautions
it's hard to predict...

988
01:39:11,447 --> 01:39:15,963
..what lenghts might
an obsessed woman go.

989
01:39:16,007 --> 01:39:19,556
Anyway, I would like to thank you.
You're a very brave woman.

990
01:39:19,607 --> 01:39:22,519
No, I'm not brave at all.

991
01:39:22,567 --> 01:39:29,484
Tell me: how could you do it ?
Did you feel a strength within ?

992
01:39:29,527 --> 01:39:33,122
That mysterious strength that pushes us
towards the suffering ones...

993
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:36,876
..with the most exact, lovely
and strong desire...

994
01:39:36,927 --> 01:39:40,363
..to help them,
free them, save them ?

995
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:44,195
Do you feel such a strength ?

996
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:53,325
No... no...
I don't know, I don't know...

997
01:39:55,167 --> 01:39:58,603
If my informations
are correct...

998
01:39:58,647 --> 01:40:04,244
That criminal, the one from the robbery...
I can't recall his name.

999
01:40:04,287 --> 01:40:09,441
He has been led by
the same strength...

1000
01:40:09,487 --> 01:40:15,517
..a strength common between
the greater souls.

1001
01:40:15,567 --> 01:40:19,480
Had I believed myself
to be a great soul,...

1002
01:40:19,527 --> 01:40:23,361
..I would have been crazy.

1003
01:40:23,407 --> 01:40:30,040
And so is love, love
towards others, true love.

1004
01:40:30,087 --> 01:40:34,603
- No, it's hate.
- Hate ?

1005
01:40:37,247 --> 01:40:43,277
Love towards others springs
from the hate I feel towards myself.

1006
01:40:43,327 --> 01:40:47,878
For everything that is and have been mine.

1007
01:40:47,927 --> 01:40:50,919
It isn't anything else.

1008
01:40:51,887 --> 01:40:56,403
- Good morning, judge.
- Good morning. Have a seat.

1009
01:40:56,447 --> 01:40:59,519
I have come to talk to you
about Mrs. Gerard case,...

1010
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:02,798
..she has been interned in
a psychiatric clinic.

1011
01:41:02,847 --> 01:41:06,635
- How is she ?
- Well...

1012
01:41:06,687 --> 01:41:11,203
- I brought you her medical file,
so you'll see. - Well.

1013
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:16,242
I think it's time
to take a decision.

1014
01:41:16,287 --> 01:41:21,315
I think we should see to
her definitive internment.

1015
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:24,484
- Then, with time...
- In the meanwhile, please leave the files here.

1016
01:41:24,527 --> 01:41:28,486
Anyway, I'll need to meet her,
and her relatives...

1017
01:41:28,527 --> 01:41:33,317
..her doctor, whoever has been
around her since her child's death.

1018
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:37,201
- Sure you should.
- We could meet all of them at the clinic.

1019
01:41:37,247 --> 01:41:41,843
It would be the best thing to do,
to avoid further annoyances.

1020
01:41:42,447 --> 01:41:45,484
When social and religious ideas
are discussed...

1021
01:41:45,527 --> 01:41:48,166
..it's difficult to give
absolute judgements.

1022
01:41:48,207 --> 01:41:52,678
Especially today... there's no truth anymore!
Everything is seduction and propaganda!

1023
01:41:52,727 --> 01:41:57,198
So, are we in front of a missionary
or of an exhalted person?

1024
01:41:57,247 --> 01:42:01,240
Had the lady followed,
even with a fanatical fervor,...

1025
01:42:01,287 --> 01:42:05,041
..a religious or
a political creed... but as such...

1026
01:42:05,087 --> 01:42:08,841
Should we opt for Mrs. Gerard
to be right,...

1027
01:42:08,887 --> 01:42:13,881
..we should then strip of our
professional clothes, and follow her.

1028
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:17,078
Sure, but then maybe we
won't be brave enough.

1029
01:42:17,127 --> 01:42:20,961
How many men that society condemned
as rebels in their days...

1030
01:42:21,007 --> 01:42:24,283
and burnt at stakes were right ?

1031
01:42:24,327 --> 01:42:28,923
Sure, but our call is to
defend society as it is...

1032
01:42:28,967 --> 01:42:31,720
..with its laws,
within its actual asset.

1033
01:42:44,467 --> 01:42:47,618
Daniela !

1034
01:42:49,347 --> 01:42:53,101
- Good morning !
- How are you, Mrs. ? - Fine, thanks.

1035
01:42:53,147 --> 01:42:58,221
- Good morning, Mrs. !
- How are you ?

1036
01:43:10,547 --> 01:43:12,902
Take the child.

1037
01:43:19,107 --> 01:43:21,018
George...

1038
01:43:22,107 --> 01:43:24,701
Please, would you sit down ?

1039
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,859
Good morning, Mrs. Please have a seat.

1040
01:43:33,827 --> 01:43:37,979
Mrs., we are here to look
after your interests...

1041
01:43:38,027 --> 01:43:43,021
..we are here to protect you.

1042
01:43:43,067 --> 01:43:47,822
You can speak freely,
don't be afraid.

1043
01:43:47,867 --> 01:43:52,019
- What do you want to know ?
- Are you a communist ? - No.

1044
01:43:52,067 --> 01:43:55,377
- Do you wish to be a nun?
- No.

1045
01:43:55,427 --> 01:43:58,146
So,
what are your ideals ?

1046
01:43:58,187 --> 01:44:02,863
- I know you worked in a factory.
- Yes.

1047
01:44:02,907 --> 01:44:06,741
So, tell me: what are
your feelings, your reactions?

1048
01:44:06,787 --> 01:44:10,177
Stop it...

1049
01:44:10,227 --> 01:44:13,902
Don't cry. It's important for
you to tell me everything.

1050
01:44:13,947 --> 01:44:18,737
Be exact, please. What are
your programs, your ideals ?

1051
01:44:18,787 --> 01:44:25,101
The ideals of those who need me
day after day.

1052
01:44:25,147 --> 01:44:29,618
Help me understand. What kind
of feelings move you?

1053
01:44:29,667 --> 01:44:32,420
If going back to your house,
to your husband...

1054
01:44:32,467 --> 01:44:36,062
No. What good would it be,
to be back home ?

1055
01:44:36,107 --> 01:44:38,621
It won't save nor me nor the others.

1056
01:44:38,667 --> 01:44:43,183
It would be really easy
to return, really easy...

1057
01:44:45,747 --> 01:44:50,696
But I'll be back being what
I was before all of this.

1058
01:44:55,867 --> 01:44:59,780
Instead, I want to share the joy
of the happy,...

1059
01:44:59,827 --> 01:45:04,503
..the pain of the suffering,...

1060
01:45:04,547 --> 01:45:07,903
..and the anguish of those who despair...

1061
01:45:07,947 --> 01:45:12,020
I'd rather lose myself with others,
then saving myself on my own.

1062
01:45:12,067 --> 01:45:15,855
Only the one who is completely free
might blend in with all the others.

1063
01:45:15,907 --> 01:45:22,460
Only the one who is bound to nothing
is bound to all human beings.

1064
01:45:22,507 --> 01:45:26,898
This is what I feel.
And now I've told you everything.

1065
01:45:28,387 --> 01:45:31,345
I have nothing to add.

1066
01:45:34,547 --> 01:45:36,981
I spoke freely.

1067
01:45:37,027 --> 01:45:41,942
And now, you'll freely do what you
believe you should, for your own good.

1068
01:45:46,067 --> 01:45:48,581
Please help me to my room.

1069
01:45:50,347 --> 01:45:53,578
- Irene ! - Here's the lady !
- What happened to her ?

1070
01:45:53,627 --> 01:45:56,699
Nothing. Don't worry.

1071
01:45:56,747 --> 01:45:59,819
- Go away, childrens.
- Lady, but...

1072
01:46:02,387 --> 01:46:06,778
- What happened ?
- Unluckily, it's like we thought.

1073
01:46:07,547 --> 01:46:09,583
I want to see my daughter !

1074
01:46:09,627 --> 01:46:11,697
Mrs. Hamilton wishes to see
her daughter.

1075
01:46:11,747 --> 01:46:15,376
The lady wishes to see
Mrs. Gerard. Please, lead her there.

1076
01:46:15,427 --> 01:46:17,736
Please, Mrs., come with me.

1077
01:46:19,107 --> 01:46:21,621
- Dear judge...
- Eh...

1078
01:46:31,387 --> 01:46:36,586
Irene, Irene...
It's all for your own good, believe me !

1079
01:46:36,627 --> 01:46:39,539
- We only care for your own good.
- Yes, I know, but stay calm.

1080
01:46:39,587 --> 01:46:46,265
- My heart is breaking !
Irene, dear daughter ! - Stay calm, mom.

1081
01:46:52,027 --> 01:46:54,495
Farewell, George.

1082
01:46:58,227 --> 01:47:00,582
Farewell, Irene.

1083
01:47:33,307 --> 01:47:36,663
- What did you do ?
- Will you leave her here ?

1084
01:47:36,707 --> 01:47:40,746
- What are you doing ?
- She is not crazy !

1085
01:47:40,787 --> 01:47:46,703
She's a saint !
A saint ! Lady ! Lady !

1086
01:47:46,747 --> 01:47:50,786
- It's an injustice !
- Poor dear !

1087
01:47:55,947 --> 01:47:59,417
She's a saint,
she's a saint !

1088
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,148
