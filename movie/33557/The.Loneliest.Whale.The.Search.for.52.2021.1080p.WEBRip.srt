00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,085
<i>...I have that position.</i>

3
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:54,753
<i>Uh, we have
a good deployment.</i>

4
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:58,658
<i>Thirty-four degrees. 11.92.</i>

5
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,295
<i>One-twenty degrees. 35.15.</i>

6
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,730
<i>Okay.
The whale we're tracking down</i>

7
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,265
<i>is to the east of us.</i>

8
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:09,168
<i>We're gonna move two miles
in that direction</i>

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,836
<i>and we'll probably
put in a buoy over there.</i>

10
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:23,849
<i>In 1992,</i>

11
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:26,786
<i>a top secret program
of the US Navy</i>

12
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,454
<i>discovered a mysterious
sound in the Pacific</i>

13
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:32,091
<i>at a frequency
of 52 hertz.</i>

14
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:37,596
<i>A marine biologist named
Dr. William Watkins</i>

15
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:40,332
<i>surmised this sound
was coming</i>

16
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:42,200
<i>from a solitary whale,</i>

17
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:44,402
<i>broadcasting at a frequency</i>

18
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,606
<i>that no other whale
could understand.</i>

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,209
<i>It's been said that
this whale has spent</i>

20
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:54,312
<i>its entire life swimming
through the oceans,</i>

21
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:58,284
<i>calling out and never once
receiving a response.</i>

22
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,388
<i>No one has heard
from this whale</i>

23
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,158
<i>since the Navy
stopped listening</i>

24
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,260
<i>over ten years ago.</i>

25
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,694
<i>No one has ever
seen this whale.</i>

26
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:14,766
<i>No one knows if he's the
first of his kind or the last.</i>

27
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,504
<i>While many have
nicknamed this creature</i>

28
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,340
<i>the Loneliest Whale
in the World...</i>

29
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,812
<i>...there are those
that call him 52.</i>

30
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:40,920
<i>So it all started
with this article</i>

31
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,391
<i>about 52,
this lonely whale.</i>

32
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:51,296
<i>This whale with
this mysterious call</i>

33
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,566
<i>that just
couldn't communicate.</i>

34
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,468
<i>It couldn't be heard.</i>

35
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,939
<i>And I remember
having this reaction.</i>

36
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:04,977
<i>You know,
the hairs on my arm just stood up.</i>

37
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:09,814
<i>For some reason, this story,
it just spoke to me.</i>

38
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,885
<i>So I went online to search
for more information,</i>

39
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:14,721
<i>and as it turns out,</i>

40
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,656
<i>it wasn't just me.</i>

41
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,858
<i>A really sad story
from the animal kingdom.</i>

42
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:22,762
<i>Legend has it
that 52 has been</i>

43
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,930
<i>roaming the ocean
for decades</i>

44
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,465
<i>entirely alone.</i>

45
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:27,932
<i>52 Hertz
has been nicknamed...</i>

46
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,036
<i>The Loneliest
Whale in the World.</i>

47
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,804
<i>It was on
a different migratory path</i>

48
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,004
<i>from other whales.</i>

49
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,607
<i>How do we
know the whale is a he?</i>

50
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,740
<i>Only the males sing.</i>

51
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:36,775
<i>Is it a higher
or lower frequency?</i>

52
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,744
<i>Higher.</i>

53
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:38,844
<i>What is it
about this whale</i>

54
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:40,779
<i>that has really moved
so many people?</i>

55
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,316
<i>It's artists,
it's filmmakers,</i>

56
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:44,550
<i>it's scientists.</i>

57
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,418
<i>What do you think it says
about us as people?</i>

58
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,721
<i>His isolation from
the incredibly social world</i>

59
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,324
<i>of his fellow whales
speaks to so many right now.</i>

60
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,492
<i>...the loneliest
creature on Earth.</i>

61
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,062
<i>Absolutely,
how could it not be lonely?</i>

62
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:06,038
<i>52 had become
this global phenomenon.</i>

63
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,874
<i>This whale who embodied
the fascination</i>

64
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,644
<i>we all have
for these gentle giants.</i>

65
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:17,515
<i>You never forget your
first time seeing a whale.</i>

66
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:21,586
<i>For me, I was a kid
working on a sailing ship.</i>

67
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,055
<i>And the moment
I saw this whale</i>

68
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:24,891
<i>leap out of the water,</i>

69
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,761
<i>I felt like I was
in the presence</i>

70
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:31,963
<i>of something
greater than myself.</i>

71
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:39,604
<i>But this
mysterious fascination</i>

72
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:40,806
<i>has always been there.</i>

73
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,877
<i>We've always sought
the great whale,</i>

74
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,047
<i>whether to slaughter it,
or now to save it.</i>

75
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,850
<i>From Jonah,
who found redemption</i>

76
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,651
<i>in the belly of a whale,</i>

77
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:56,756
<i>to Captain Ahab, who found
the ultimate adversary</i>

78
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:59,024
<i>in his hunt for a whale.</i>

79
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:01,828
<i>These epic stories
are ingrained in our culture,</i>

80
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,697
<i>in our consciousness.</i>

81
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:09,868
<i>But what about this new
story of the lonely whale?</i>

82
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:14,706
<i>Why did so many connect
with this one creature?</i>

83
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:19,644
<i>Was it just this notion
of loneliness?</i>

84
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,551
Hmm... I don't know.

85
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,054
All we know is
what he sounds like

86
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:31,390
and where he's
possibly going.

87
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,460
And is that
his signature

88
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,063
- over there on the wall?
- That's his signature.

89
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,532
<i>Wow.</i>

90
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:44,870
<i>When we first detected 52
was back in '89.</i>

91
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:48,040
<i>He is just like
a regular blue or fin whale,</i>

92
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:49,908
but the frequency he was,
you know,

93
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,711
vocalizing at was
at the 52 hertz level,

94
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,848
not, you know,
down around 20 hertz.

95
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:59,985
<i>Now, we'd seen that signal
a couple times</i>

96
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,721
<i>and we dismissed it
as being another source.</i>

97
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:04,824
So what did
you think it was

98
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,926
before you realized
it was a whale?

99
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:10,094
That I can't tell you.

100
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,830
So,
something classified?

101
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,532
Something mechanical,
that's it.

102
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,250
<i>It was the beginnings</i>

103
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,152
<i>of the Cold War
in the 1950s.</i>

104
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,222
<i>The American Navy
was doing everything possible</i>

105
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:39,191
<i>to be one step ahead
of the Russians.</i>

106
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,928
And they decided they wanted
to listen underwater

107
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,932
for what those Russian
submarines were up to.

108
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:50,735
<i>So we developed
this secret array</i>

109
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,103
<i>of underwater microphones</i>

110
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:55,107
<i>to listen to all the
sounds in the ocean.</i>

111
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,845
<i>It was called
Sound Surveillance System.</i>

112
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,545
<i>"SOSUS."</i>

113
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:07,218
This was a 24-hour job,
365 days of the year.

114
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,222
There is always
someone watching.

115
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:13,925
<i>And they heard
all kinds of sounds.</i>

116
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,597
<i>It turned out most of them
came from whales.</i>

117
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,807
<i>In those early days,</i>

118
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,909
<i>we needed to understand
the difference</i>

119
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:34,579
<i>between the sound
of a submarine</i>

120
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,282
<i>and the voiceprint
of a whale.</i>

121
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:42,788
Most of the knowledge we have
about "whale song"

122
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,757
is focused on
humpback whales.

123
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:51,896
<i>But then we have
blue whales and fin whales.</i>

124
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,865
<i>They're infrasonic,</i>

125
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,870
<i>below the auditory threshold
of human beings.</i>

126
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:03,575
<i>Blue whales sing
a very soft simple melody,</i>

127
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,910
<i>but all around 100 hertz.</i>

128
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:11,584
<i>Just a few low phrases, like,
"Mmm. Mmm." That's it.</i>

129
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,086
No more variety
or structure than that.

130
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,021
<i>And here is the sound
of the fin whale.</i>

131
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:18,990
<i>One sound, "Mmm,"</i>

132
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:22,126
<i>then several minutes later,
again, "Mmm,"</i>

133
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,663
<i>and exactly the same amount
of time later, "Mmm."</i>

134
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,198
It's an exact,
regular rhythm.

135
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:30,201
We have no idea how such
a whale could be so regular.

136
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:37,208
<i>They sound
like a submarine.</i>

137
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,216
So this is where people
like Bill Watkins

138
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,085
<i>were asked by the Navy</i>

139
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,088
<i>to catalogue what it is
we're listening to.</i>

140
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,725
<i>The
Navy would have a question</i>

141
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,994
<i>about what they were hearing,</i>

142
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,596
<i>what they were calling noise.</i>

143
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,764
<i>And I was asked
to look at it.</i>

144
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,837
And I think that it's the same
rationale that I have today,

145
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,706
is that if you're
going to be working

146
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:08,974
with underwater sound
in the ocean,

147
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,308
well, you oughta know
what's there.

148
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:13,946
<i>It was Bill Watkins</i>

149
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,749
<i>who looked at
this one signature,</i>

150
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,918
<i>and he says,
"This looks biologic."</i>

151
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:25,024
<i>That's how we found it.
The 52 Hertz.</i>

152
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:30,863
<i>So, we were able
to track him for 12 years.</i>

153
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:40,271
And how did the rest
of the community react to 52?

154
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,007
The rest
of the community, uh...

155
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,977
There's a lot of
skepticism in it.

156
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:50,849
<i>Some people discredit it
as not being a whale.</i>

157
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,855
<i>You know, why is he vocalizing
at this frequency</i>

158
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:59,024
<i>and there's not another one
out there?</i>

159
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:04,964
A lot of skepticism in that
as to what this was.

160
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,735
<i>But, I think, to Bill Watkins,</i>

161
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:14,206
<i>it was something unknown,
something to explore.</i>

162
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:19,044
<i>He passed away in 2004.</i>

163
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:25,116
<i>So, we went forth
and published a paper on it.</i>

164
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:32,324
We have never seen another
signature like that.

165
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:33,925
And, you know,

166
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,860
going through it,
I've looked all the time

167
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:39,331
just seeing if there's
another one, at all.

168
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:43,402
To see if, uh, you know...

169
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,403
Just to see
if he's not the only one.

170
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:50,041
<i>And never seen
another one like it.</i>

171
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,944
<i>Did you guys ever
think about going out</i>

172
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:55,480
<i>to actually try
and visually locate him?</i>

173
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,283
We'll say,
I thought about it,

174
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,418
but I know Bill didn't,

175
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,520
because he knew that, uh,

176
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:04,423
it was a needle
in a haystack.

177
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,427
<i>For me, it was kind of,
like, a dream</i>

178
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,495
<i>to go out there
and search for him,</i>

179
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,066
but also,
reality hitting in,

180
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:18,370
knowing that the odds
of that are very slim.

181
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,810
<i>We haven't
looked for him since 2003.</i>

182
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,181
And what if somebody
went and looked for him now?

183
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,150
Oh, my God,
that would be...

184
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:34,819
Wow, I mean,
couldn't even explain it,

185
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:37,522
how great that would be.

186
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,326
<i>We have no idea what it is,
because we haven't seen it.</i>

187
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,197
<i>And once you do that,</i>

188
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,000
<i>you could solve
the mystery of the 52.</i>

189
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,139
<i>Bill Watkins
helped solve</i>

190
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:57,275
<i>some of the ocean's
greatest mysteries.</i>

191
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,814
<i>He was a man who knew
that what we can hear</i>

192
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,384
<i>is sometimes more powerful
than what we can see.</i>

193
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:12,924
<i>Yet, tragically, he left
this one work unfinished.</i>

194
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,160
<i>That of 52.</i>

195
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:19,230
<i>This whale that we knew
so little about.</i>

196
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,837
<i>And now 11 years later,
the myth has taken over.</i>

197
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,577
<i>You know, we call him "the
loneliest whale in the world,"</i>

198
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,846
<i>but was it really true?</i>

199
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,317
<i>We invented this legend,</i>

200
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,119
<i>because we didn't
have the truth.</i>

201
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,055
<i>But what if we could
set the record straight?</i>

202
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,326
<i>What if we can discover
whether this whale</i>

203
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,364
<i>was really an anomaly,
or even a new species?</i>

204
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:56,134
<i>No one has ever seen 52,
but what if we could?</i>

205
00:13:56,167 --> 00:14:00,372
<i>What if this was a mystery
we could solve?</i>

206
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:03,541
<i>It's curiosity.
It's adventure.</i>

207
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,544
<i>And it's a crazy idea.</i>

208
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:08,980
<i>But this was a chance
to do something epic.</i>

209
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,052
<i>To find one whale
in an entire ocean.</i>

210
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,623
<i>To find 52.</i>

211
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,036
<i>Hey, Bruce,
my name is Josh Zeman.</i>

212
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:33,504
<i>I'm a filmmaker
and I wanted to talk to you</i>

213
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:37,408
<i>about mounting an expedition
to find the 52 Hertz Whale.</i>

214
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,497
There's 3,600 square miles
in this square.

215
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,400
Three thousand miles
within one of these squares?

216
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:03,701
Yeah.
And the animals are moving

217
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:06,205
maybe 125 miles a day.

218
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,942
Yeah. I mean,
they're going somewhere.

219
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:13,577
I mean, Daniel and I
are used to looking

220
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,580
at the things
that are stereotypical.

221
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,183
We expected
a typical baleen whale

222
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,318
to be going south
for the winter,

223
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:23,288
and instead, if we look at all
the Joe George information,

224
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:25,624
it went up into
the Gulf of Alaska.

225
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,591
What does an expedition
like this look like,

226
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,628
in terms of details?

227
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,730
We need to justify
the science, time, and money

228
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:36,033
being spent on
this kind of a mission.

229
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,437
That's why we need
to have more assurance

230
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,742
that 52 Hertz is not only
still on schedule...

231
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,009
Mm-hmm.

232
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,278
...but just that
it even lives.

233
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,514
If we don't have that,
we're sort of shooting in the dark.

234
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:52,051
And I wouldn't say
we have much of a chance.

235
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,287
<i>Maybe even as recently
as this year,</i>

236
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,555
<i>the animal's passed away.</i>

237
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,490
<i>While these large whales</i>

238
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,493
<i>live on average
60 to 70 years,</i>

239
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,228
<i>the only way to prove
52 is still alive</i>

240
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,663
<i>is to hear him calling out,</i>

241
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:10,034
<i>which means gaining access to
the classified SOSUS system.</i>

242
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,337
<i>Yet, after a year of
back and forth with the Navy,</i>

243
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,173
<i>they refused to participate...</i>

244
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:19,510
<i>...leading us
to Bob Dziak,</i>

245
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,614
<i>a government scientist
who uses the SOSUS</i>

246
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,783
<i>to study underwater volcanoes.</i>

247
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:30,322
<i>Bob and his team
have agreed to help.</i>

248
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,612
It's like you're
in the mouth of the whale.

249
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,246
Yes.

250
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,113
Doesn't really sound like

251
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,450
we would think
a whale calls, right?

252
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:01,118
Whale calls
oftentimes are sped up

253
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,455
because they're below
our threshold of hearing.

254
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,523
Do you want to hear

255
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,590
this one sped up
ten times?

256
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:06,658
- Yeah.
- Okay.

257
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:15,366
- That's ten times.
- Wow.

258
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,668
If that isn't
a call for mama,

259
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,202
I don't know what is.

260
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:30,581
This is from 1993.

261
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:33,518
- That is 52 right there?
- Yeah.

262
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,320
It's so difficult
to actually figure that out.

263
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,456
That's the challenge.

264
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,723
- Yeah.
- Right there.

265
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:43,194
There's sort of an art
to listening to sound

266
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,764
in the sea and being able
to pick it apart.

267
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:49,134
Mechanical noise seems
to be just really consistent

268
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:53,137
and very, uh,
what we call stereotypical.

269
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,106
<i>And so, biological sound,
sort of,</i>

270
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,443
<i>has an unevenness
to it, in a way.</i>

271
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,279
<i>But if there is a lot
of noise going around,</i>

272
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:03,648
it can be hard to pull out.

273
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,817
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

274
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:10,554
So, one of the
issues is that this part here

275
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:14,593
looks to us like what a
52 hertz whale call could be,

276
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,662
but we're not
getting clean data.

277
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:20,564
There's other whale calls
going on,

278
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:24,135
and so, it's hard to find
the 52 Hertz Whale

279
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,139
in data that has lots of
other things going on in it.

280
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,442
It will give me a time when it
thinks it's actually found...

281
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,576
- False positives? Yeah.
- False positives.

282
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,711
And then
I actually have to go

283
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,479
and look at
each false positive.

284
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:38,215
How many
false positives?

285
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:41,353
Uh, on one phone,
I got 67,000 hits.

286
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,790
I'll be honest,
I was not going to go

287
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:49,594
trying to do the film until
I could prove 100 percent

288
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:52,364
- that 52 is still alive.
- Right.

289
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,597
- 'Cause it's been ten years...
- Right.

290
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:54,766
...since you last
listened to him.

291
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,634
Who knows what
can happen in ten years.

292
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,671
So what's your gut tell you?

293
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,608
Uh...

294
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:05,710
I don't think
we're gonna find it

295
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:08,212
in contemporary data,
to be honest.

296
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,782
What does that mean?

297
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,884
I'm not sure that that means
that it's not there.

298
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,453
I think it's...

299
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:19,924
I think you need to go
out and look for it.

300
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,493
If that's what
you really wanna do.

301
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,778
<i>It's just one of those
things that's too hard to figure out.</i>

302
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:44,682
<i>Till now, no one's bothered
to delve deeper</i>

303
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:47,284
<i>into the mystery
of the 52 Hertz Whale.</i>

304
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:53,357
The mere fact that a mystery
like this can still be around

305
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:57,495
<i>just shows how wild and crazy
mysterious nature still is.</i>

306
00:19:57,528 --> 00:20:00,298
<i>We're still coming up
with things we can't explain.</i>

307
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:09,340
<i>The ocean is the last
great universe of exploration.</i>

308
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,577
It is the origin of life.

309
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,783
<i>How do we explore the ocean?
How do we understand it?</i>

310
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,655
<i>There's that thrill.</i>

311
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,291
<i>The thrill of discovery.</i>

312
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,995
<i>The thrill of
the exploration itself.</i>

313
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,266
<i>The thrill of the journey.</i>

314
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,001
<i>To be a true explorer,</i>

315
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,271
you have to be willing
to put yourself at risk.

316
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,473
And that has to be thrilling,

317
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,509
or you're not going
to succeed with that.

318
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:48,913
<i>Almost every
project involving whales</i>

319
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,416
<i>has a little bit of
this aspect of</i> Moby Dick.

320
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,918
<i>This, kind of,
relentless obsession</i>

321
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,320
<i>that's going to go nowhere,
towards disaster.</i>

322
00:20:57,587 --> 00:21:00,392
Even contemplating whales
is to dare to,

323
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:01,993
you know, to reach
toward greatness.

324
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:05,297
<i>To think about something
far more vast</i>

325
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,365
<i>than humans could ever be.</i>

326
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,570
<i>We should be going after
all great mysteries like this.</i>

327
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:25,716
<i>We're all chasing
something.</i>

328
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,419
<i>We all have
our own white whale.</i>

329
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,955
<i>And mine was 52.</i>

330
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,761
<i>This whale who refused
to stop calling,</i>

331
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:40,464
<i>who refused to stop
trying to connect.</i>

332
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,837
<i>I guess that's why
I couldn't let it go.</i>

333
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,775
<i>Not when there was still some
chance that he was out there.</i>

334
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:53,378
<i>So I would keep listening,</i>

335
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:54,746
<i>for however long it took.</i>

336
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:09,894
<i>Hello?</i>

337
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,463
<i>Hey, John,
this is Josh Zeman.</i>

338
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,864
<i>You left me
a message about</i>

339
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,832
<i>the 52 Hertz Whale
documentary.</i>

340
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:17,035
<i>Yeah,
thanks for calling me back.</i>

341
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,372
<i>So, we have a series
of recording sites</i>

342
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:23,607
<i>that are off
the West Coast.</i>

343
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:27,379
<i>Pretty coastal in close
to Southern California.</i>

344
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:30,014
<i>And so, you know,
having heard</i>

345
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:32,416
<i>about the 52 Hertz Whale
for a long time,</i>

346
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,552
<i>I was kind of interested
in going through</i>

347
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,054
<i>some of our recordings</i>

348
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,722
<i>and seeing
if we could locate</i>

349
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:41,159
- <i>the 52 Hertz Whale.</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

350
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:44,496
<i>Well, so I just
wanted to let you know</i>

351
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:45,596
<i>that we found it.</i>

352
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,799
<i>Wait, wait, wait,
wait, when was this?</i>

353
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:49,067
<i>This is all recent.</i>

354
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:51,101
<i>The last
couple years or so.</i>

355
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:52,703
<i>In the Gulf of Alaska?</i>

356
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,806
<i>No, we found it</i>

357
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:56,974
<i>along the coast
here in California.</i>

358
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,612
<i>So, it's...
So, it's still alive?</i>

359
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:03,882
<i>Yup.
It's out there.</i>

360
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:19,029
<i>After more
than four years</i>

361
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,932
<i>of planning and preparation,</i>

362
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:26,471
<i>we launched our expedition in
search of the 52 Hertz Whale.</i>

363
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:28,005
<i>While we only
had enough support</i>

364
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,807
<i>for a seven-day mission,</i>

365
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,609
<i>we still had some of the best
scientists in the world</i>

366
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:34,511
<i>to help us.</i>

367
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>My name is John Hildebrand.</i>

368
00:23:35,712 --> 00:23:38,482
<i>I'm a professor at the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography</i>

369
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:40,685
<i>at University of California,
San Diego.</i>

370
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,921
I'm gonna be leading
the acoustics effort

371
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:45,990
on our search
for the 52 Hertz Whale.

372
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:48,692
What's in the box?

373
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:51,729
- Sonobuoys.
- Wow, they're heavy.

374
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:54,631
Yeah, the box
is about 1,000 pounds.

375
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:56,667
So, these will
basically listen

376
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,635
for the 52 hertz signal

377
00:23:58,669 --> 00:23:59,838
and kind of tell you where

378
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,605
the direction of that...
where that is?

379
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:02,940
- Well, if you have two of 'em.
- Yeah.

380
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:04,741
From this one,
it has this direction

381
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:05,876
and this one
has this direction,

382
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,146
you can cross the bearings
and you know where it is.

383
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:09,314
- Triangulate instantly.
- Right.

384
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:12,483
And they used to use
these to look for submarines,

385
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,586
and now we're using it
to find a whale.

386
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:16,721
Yes. They've been retired
from the Navy,

387
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:19,022
and now we're using them
for working on whales.

388
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:20,725
So it's kind of a nice gift.

389
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,630
<i>We want to find it,</i>

390
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:28,799
<i>one whale,
but it's a big ocean,</i>

391
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:32,237
so if we're gonna find it,
we need help.

392
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:34,605
- Hello.
- Hello.

393
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,907
- Hey, Ana.
- Hi.

394
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,677
<i>I'm John Calambokidis.
I'm a research biologist</i>

395
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,546
<i>and I've been
studying blue whales</i>

396
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:42,614
<i>for about 35 years.</i>

397
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:43,780
Here we are.

398
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:44,849
<i>I kind of recognized</i>

399
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:48,219
<i>it was a huge challenge
to do this.</i>

400
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,855
I mean, I go out and try
to find blue whales

401
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:53,590
and there are 2,000 of 'em
on the West Coast,

402
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:55,927
and sometimes
that's a challenge.

403
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,764
<i>Now we're talking about
finding maybe one.</i>

404
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,932
<i>But any scientist
would be captivated</i>

405
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:04,935
<i>by the opportunity
to solve that mystery.</i>

406
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:10,107
<i>So, John Hildebrand called me
six months ago and he said,</i>

407
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,576
"I can't think of anyone
better than you

408
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:12,644
"that could do this.

409
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,044
"I could do the acoustics,

410
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,946
<i>"you got all
the boat experience.</i>

411
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,682
<i>"We could do this together
and maybe learn a few things."</i>

412
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:20,083
- ...around this area.
- Yeah.

413
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:22,820
And that's when I said,
"I'm in."

414
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,128
<i>It's more
than just curiosity.</i>

415
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,534
<i>People assume that we know
more than we actually do.</i>

416
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,669
<i>There's the bit we can see,</i>

417
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:41,306
<i>whatever's happening
on the surface.</i>

418
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:45,109
<i>But then there's the 95
percent that we can't see.</i>

419
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,946
There's just so much
we don't know.

420
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:58,722
In 2004, we came right
out here, off San Miguel,

421
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,225
and we encountered a big
group of blue and fin whales,

422
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:03,227
and in amongst them,
paired with a blue whale,

423
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:06,931
was this whale that looked
in between the two.

424
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:08,198
So we got a skin sample,

425
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:10,268
we had that
genetically analyzed.

426
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,803
Fifty-fifty hybrid between
blue and fin whales.

427
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:14,739
Could that have been
the 52 Hertz Whale?

428
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:17,808
It could have been.
It could have been that whale.

429
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:19,977
Wow. That's...

430
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,646
And at that time,
we weren't linking

431
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,282
any of that in any way.

432
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:31,990
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

433
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,867
So,
talk to me about the back.

434
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:44,902
If it looks good,
I'll keep going.

435
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:46,370
- You're good, yeah.
- All right, here we go.

436
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,073
All right, guys, coming down.

437
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:51,709
That crane's
coin operated?

438
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,877
It is coin operated.

439
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:11,096
It has begun.

440
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:34,986
So we had,
just purely out of curiosity,

441
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,121
we assigned an intern

442
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:41,025
to look for what we're going
to refer to as Watkins' whale.

443
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,460
And there are four sites

444
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:45,429
where she can pick out
this unusual call.

445
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,898
At Hoke Seamount,
which is far offshore,

446
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,701
which is where Watkins
described it before.

447
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:52,102
- Mm-hmm.
- But she found it

448
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:53,904
at Point Conception,

449
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,040
she found it at Palos Verdes,

450
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:57,341
and she found it
off of La Jolla.

451
00:27:57,374 --> 00:28:00,778
So, these are
relatively coastal.

452
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,846
But how come
we wouldn't

453
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:03,980
have known this before?

454
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:06,250
Well, it's just that
there's a new dimension,

455
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:08,251
beyond what Bill knew,

456
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:12,490
that the whale actually does
come in coastally. Right?

457
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:16,394
And here we are
in the Santa Barbara Channel,

458
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:17,928
and the whale is there.

459
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:21,432
We find, pretty consistently,

460
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:24,301
both at site C and site B,

461
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,904
that there are these calls
in October.

462
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:28,772
So, if we
have any chance

463
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,142
of finding this animal,
it's right now?

464
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:34,278
Yep, we're in the right time
and the right place.

465
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,281
Right.

466
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,250
So, where is it?

467
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,929
<i>While 52 may be alone,
according to our scientists,</i>

468
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:55,900
<i>he wasn't as isolated
as the legend suggested.</i>

469
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,336
<i>Chances are he was following
other whales</i>

470
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:01,838
<i>migrating up and down
the West Coast.</i>

471
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,008
<i>And stopping
along Point Conception</i>

472
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,876
<i>to forage for food.</i>

473
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:10,014
<i>And it wasn't that
other whales couldn't hear 52,</i>

474
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,786
<i>they just couldn't understand
what he was saying,</i>

475
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:17,320
<i>leaving this whale
the perennial outsider.</i>

476
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:22,026
<i>Yet, it was also
the uniqueness of 52's call</i>

477
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:24,961
<i>that just may lead us
right to him.</i>

478
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:30,367
<i>So, if you want
to find the 52 Hertz Whale,</i>

479
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,303
<i>there are two parts to this.</i>

480
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:35,839
<i>First, we have
a bioacoustic team,</i>

481
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:40,010
<i>real-time listening
using the sonobuoys.</i>

482
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,247
<i>So when we hear
the 52 hertz sound,</i>

483
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,883
<i>we can say, "This is the spot
where that sound came from.</i>

484
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:48,552
<i>"Let's go over
and investigate."</i>

485
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,555
<i>Then we're going to have
to have a small boat</i>

486
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:53,957
<i>that approaches the animal.
That's John C.</i>

487
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:56,027
<i>He'll take their picture,</i>

488
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:59,396
<i>get a skin sample,
attach a tag.</i>

489
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:02,399
So, that's the plan.

490
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,903
Bridge, do we have
a go-ahead to deploy?

491
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:14,110
Kind of, uh,
northeasterly course.

492
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:28,391
Okay,
I'm going to go deep.

493
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:29,527
Roger that.

494
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:34,199
You ready for this?

495
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:45,375
They say, uh, you know
you're doing oceanography

496
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:47,211
when what you have
is too heavy to lift,

497
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:49,012
and too expensive to lose,

498
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:51,115
and then you throw it
in the ocean anyways.

499
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,456
<i>I first heard
about the 52 Hertz Whale</i>

500
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,558
<i>in an article
in</i> The New York Times.

501
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,528
<i>The idea that
there's a species of whale</i>

502
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,097
<i>making a sound that no one
has ever heard before.</i>

503
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:16,033
<i>It's an amazing tale
of craziness.</i>

504
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,576
<i>I've traveled around the world
making music,</i>

505
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:28,645
<i>trying to jam together
with whales.</i>

506
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,381
'Cause I really believe
you can use music

507
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:32,249
to get in touch
with other species,

508
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:35,052
to communicate in a way
where language fails.

509
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:42,159
There he really
seems to respond to me,

510
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,696
and now he almost
matches my note.

511
00:32:48,565 --> 00:32:50,234
Right there.

512
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,269
<i>To play along with whale song,</i>

513
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:55,639
<i>the sense that humans
really can touch</i>

514
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:59,677
<i>upon something very mysterious
that we barely understand.</i>

515
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,046
<i>We're in awe
of what happens in the sea.</i>

516
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,986
<i>The idea that there's
a mystery noise underwater.</i>

517
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:10,788
<i>52 hertz. It's a sound</i>

518
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,622
<i>that's not like anything else
we know.</i>

519
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:15,393
It's amazing and fascinating

520
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:16,593
to think that
even in this day,

521
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,361
we're listening
all over the ocean,

522
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,764
we're still hearing things
that we cannot explain.

523
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:27,538
<i>When you look at the sea,</i>

524
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,040
<i>you're looking
at a vast mystery.</i>

525
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:37,548
<i>What we have to learn to do
is to listen.</i>

526
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:45,189
Sound in the ocean
travels huge distances.

527
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:47,590
It is propagated much better

528
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:50,594
through water
than through air.

529
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:55,398
<i>The sounds
of fin and blue whales</i>

530
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:58,336
<i>could travel
about 13,000 miles.</i>

531
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:02,440
<i>In fact,
if you were listening,</i>

532
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:06,143
<i>and you had a proper ear,
as whales do,</i>

533
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:07,811
<i>you would be able
to hear things</i>

534
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,347
<i>that are completely
across oceans.</i>

535
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:12,783
<i>Water is dense,</i>

536
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:17,288
<i>so sound travels
almost five times faster.</i>

537
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:22,559
<i>And the lower
the pitch of your voice,</i>

538
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,728
the more efficiently
it travels.

539
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,598
<i>Think of this,</i>

540
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:32,869
<i>the song of a whale,
the wavelength of that song,</i>

541
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:36,406
<i>stretches one football field.</i>

542
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:42,613
<i>A note, by the time
it's finished,</i>

543
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:45,149
<i>has traveled 30 miles,</i>

544
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,486
<i>so everything is expanded.</i>

545
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:52,523
You have to take your mind
and just stretch it.

546
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:57,862
<i>The whole ocean
is illuminated</i>

547
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:59,697
<i>by the sounds of the whale,</i>

548
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,467
<i>shining its flashlight around,</i>

549
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,170
<i>figuring out
what's all around it.</i>

550
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:10,307
<i>It just happens to be sound,
not light, that it's using.</i>

551
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:23,754
<i>This is
a long-range social network.</i>

552
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:28,226
<i>Humpback whales, for example,</i>

553
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,362
<i>they have notes,
they have phrases,</i>

554
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:33,431
<i>they have themes,
they have songs,</i>

555
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:36,433
<i>like a musical composition.</i>

556
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,744
<i>They're beautiful,</i>

557
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:51,715
<i>but it turns out
that these whales,</i>

558
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:53,717
<i>after about 10 minutes,</i>

559
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:56,853
<i>start repeating themselves.</i>

560
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,830
The first thought
you have, of course, is,

561
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:08,331
"Oh, my gosh,
what do they mean?"

562
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:09,567
That's what
you want to know.

563
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:14,370
<i>They have dialects.</i>

564
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:19,275
<i>A social mechanism
for identifying who they are.</i>

565
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:25,882
<i>When you watch and you listen
to these animals</i>

566
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,385
<i>communicating
or moving as a herd</i>

567
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:32,256
over hundreds of...
thousands of square miles.

568
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:35,326
<i>They move often
in a very coordinated fashion.</i>

569
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,664
<i>All mediated
through their voices.</i>

570
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,532
<i>These animals are in sync</i>

571
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:44,768
<i>with huge areas
of time and space.</i>

572
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:48,672
We are just scratching
the surface

573
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:52,675
in terms of the complexity of
their communications system.

574
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,016
So you can imagine.

575
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:03,519
Here's this whale,
it makes a very strange sound

576
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:05,922
<i>and if there's nothing
out there...</i>

577
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,891
<i>I mean, blue whales
are not going to respond</i>

578
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:08,925
<i>to this 52 hertz sound,</i>

579
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,527
<i>and fin whales
aren't going to respond,</i>

580
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,431
<i>so who does respond?</i>

581
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:23,673
- ...first deployment.
- Roger that.

582
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:25,375
We'll give you
some feedback in a second.

583
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:28,679
<i>So, we're looking</i>

584
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,715
<i>for an animal
that's really rare.</i>

585
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,784
And we think
that the 52 Hertz,

586
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,420
it's a lot like a blue whale.

587
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:37,487
It's probably
not a blue whale,

588
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,956
but it's a lot like
a blue whale,

589
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:41,425
so if we go out and find
concentrations of blue whales,

590
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,927
that's a pretty good place
to start.

591
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,366
<i>It's been
kind of a question</i>

592
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,403
<i>kicking around
among whale researchers</i>

593
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,805
<i>ever since first described
by Bill Watkins.</i>

594
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,476
<i>Was this some
new type of whale?</i>

595
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:01,077
<i>We didn't really know.</i>

596
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:05,848
<i>But I've been very interested
in the question of hybrids</i>

597
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:07,485
<i>between blue and fin whales.</i>

598
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:10,987
<i>So, the interesting question
has been,</i>

599
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,990
<i>"Could the 52 Hertz Whale</i>

600
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:15,492
<i>"be some hybrid
of the two species?"</i>

601
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:22,465
I heard about 52 Hertz
from Watkins.

602
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:25,001
<i>But he wasn't willing
to speculate much</i>

603
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:27,770
<i>on what the whale was.</i>

604
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,907
<i>I remember when I reviewed
the paper, I said,</i>

605
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,875
<i>"Well, you know,
you should describe,</i>

606
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,710
<i>"how is it similar
to blue whales,</i>

607
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,878
<i>"how is it similar
to fin whales,</i>

608
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:36,980
<i>"maybe it's some combination."</i>

609
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:39,516
I was trying to get him
to push a little bit

610
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:40,784
on the theory
of "What is this?"

611
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:42,085
But he wouldn't go there.

612
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,456
<i>I think
if we can tag this whale,</i>

613
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,692
<i>and photograph,
collect samples,</i>

614
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:50,993
<i>maybe we can
figure out an answer</i>

615
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,030
<i>to identify
the 52 Hertz Whale.</i>

616
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,599
<i>This is step one.</i>

617
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:05,842
<i>Outside of hearing 52,
our best chance of finding him</i>

618
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,644
<i>was to look
for concentrations of whales,</i>

619
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:09,746
<i>all feeding together.</i>

620
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:15,551
<i>Which meant tagging as many
fin whales, blue whales,</i>

621
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,588
<i>and even humpbacks
as possible,</i>

622
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,660
<i>in hopes one will lead us
to these large groups,</i>

623
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:27,398
<i>all feasting in these
nutrient-rich waters</i>

624
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:31,735
<i>where we might hear,
or even see 52 among them.</i>

625
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,515
- You wanna tag five again?
- Uh, yeah.

626
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:46,416
<i>Some of the tags
that we're talking about</i>

627
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:47,984
<i>have never been
deployed before.</i>

628
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,753
<i>We are miniaturizing
the cameras</i>

629
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:52,423
<i>that go on these
small instruments,</i>

630
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,625
<i>adding these high sampling
rate accelerometers</i>

631
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:56,926
<i>that can detect
if the call is coming</i>

632
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,762
<i>from the animal
it's attached to.</i>

633
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:02,665
<i>These are brand-new
pieces of technology</i>

634
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:03,967
<i>we're bringing to bear.</i>

635
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:15,012
Yep, sounds good.

636
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,652
We're hearing them.

637
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:24,422
There you go.
That's a nice one.

638
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:27,857
It's a blue whale call.

639
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,927
Truth <i>boat
preparing to launch drone.</i>

640
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:32,128
<i>Drone is in the air.</i>

641
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,866
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

642
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:42,873
There they are.

643
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,019
Not really totally sure
what this animal's doing.

644
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:59,255
It's been alternating,
seemingly holding

645
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:01,859
a little bit of a westerly
traveling course.

646
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:06,197
Uh, starting to get
just a little nervous.

647
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,365
Maybe we've lost this whale.

648
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:11,602
Maybe we should spread our
boats out a little bit more

649
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,004
to guard against
a change of direction.

650
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:23,481
<i>We got a visual.</i>

651
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:25,648
Downwind.

652
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:34,925
What's our range?

653
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,260
150 meters.

654
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:59,849
- Damn, that was so close.
- Yeah, that was really close.

655
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:07,591
Yeah.

656
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:36,653
Good ship's on its way.

657
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:42,159
What I'm able to do
is pull data

658
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,728
from the copter
while it's flying,

659
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,663
and it will tell you
the GPS location

660
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:49,365
as that
down to the second.

661
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:50,299
Timestamp...

662
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,001
Timewise, which is synced
with your GPS.

663
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:53,737
It is. Okay.

664
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:55,005
And can you
keep playing it ahead?

665
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:57,206
Because my recollection, too,
is he did a series of breaths.

666
00:42:58,074 --> 00:42:59,909
Here we go.

667
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:18,228
I think this is the first time
that you guys have caught,

668
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,297
on a drone from the air,
a blue whale

669
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:23,165
in the act of calling
and known it.

670
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,068
You're usually not combining
these two mediums.

671
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:29,338
And we know they call
not right at the surface,

672
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:31,774
but slightly submerged.

673
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:33,409
So, this is
totally consistent

674
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:34,745
with the behavior
of them calling.

675
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,721
<i>If 52 was with
other large groups of whales,</i>

676
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:48,125
<i>our drones could now help us
single him out from the crowd.</i>

677
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:53,062
<i>Yet, despite having
all this new technology,</i>

678
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:56,900
<i>we still hadn't heard
52's mysterious call.</i>

679
00:43:56,932 --> 00:43:59,068
<i>A call that could be echoing
through the ocean depths</i>

680
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:01,404
<i>right at this very moment.</i>

681
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,740
<i>Just waiting to be heard.</i>

682
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,387
<i>So imagine
yourself in the 16th century</i>

683
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:22,058
<i>on a big sailing boat
crossing the ocean.</i>

684
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:29,266
<i>And you're in a bunk
below the water line</i>

685
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:32,235
<i>and your head
is on a wooden board</i>

686
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:34,371
<i>connected to the hull
of that ship.</i>

687
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,978
<i>You would hear
the voices of whales.</i>

688
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,919
<i>You would hear
singing humpbacks.</i>

689
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:53,155
<i>You would hear
the "click, click" clicking</i>

690
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:54,990
<i>of sperm whales.</i>

691
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:59,096
<i>And it was probably
a little terrifying,</i>

692
00:44:59,128 --> 00:45:00,797
<i>because you had no idea</i>

693
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:02,965
<i>what it was
that you were listening to.</i>

694
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,403
<i>Those stories exist.</i>

695
00:45:07,436 --> 00:45:10,139
<i>The siren song
of the ocean exists</i>

696
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:14,310
<i>from the earliest historical
musings of mankind.</i>

697
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:20,384
<i>And then suddenly,
we are immersed in a world</i>

698
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,920
<i>where we decided
to kill whales.</i>

699
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:32,995
<i>You know, whales were
important to human beings</i>

700
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:34,364
<i>in the 19th century,</i>

701
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:36,099
<i>when whale oil was lighting up</i>

702
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:38,001
<i>all of
the industrial revolution.</i>

703
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:42,271
<i>And whales used to be
the main source of oil.</i>

704
00:45:42,304 --> 00:45:44,907
<i>For all lamps.
For all lubrication.</i>

705
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,044
It was big business
killing whales.

706
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:51,981
<i>And even as petroleum
was discovered,</i>

707
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:53,516
<i>we didn't really need
all of this whale oil,</i>

708
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,152
<i>but we kept on killing them.</i>

709
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:56,219
<i>The momentum was there.</i>

710
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,322
<i>We kept on killing,
kept on killing.</i>

711
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:02,057
<i>We're not
talking about the heroic guy</i>

712
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,293
<i>in the front of a boat
with a spear, no.</i>

713
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:06,430
<i>We're talking about</i>

714
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:10,367
<i>the floating factory vessels
with that stern slipway</i>

715
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,568
<i>that could draw
an entire whale up</i>

716
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,804
<i>into the body of the ship.</i>

717
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,006
<i>And not only are they using</i>

718
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,843
<i>explosive ordnance
in those harpoon darts...</i>

719
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:22,278
<i>Before it can sink,
they pierce the animal</i>

720
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:25,147
<i>with a hypodermic tube</i>

721
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:26,849
that's attached
to an air compressor,

722
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:28,317
inflate the animal
so it's turned

723
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,421
into a kind of corpse buoy.

724
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:34,391
<i>And it's not an assembly line,
it's a disassembly line</i>

725
00:46:34,423 --> 00:46:37,795
<i>for the rendering
of corpse after corpse.</i>

726
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,963
<i>Those ships could process</i>

727
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:44,134
<i>dozens of animals
in a matter of hours.</i>

728
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:53,109
<i>By the 1960s,
almost all the large whales,</i>

729
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,477
<i>the blue whales,
the fin whales, the humpbacks,</i>

730
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,146
<i>almost all of them were gone.</i>

731
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:05,989
<i>And this all began to change</i>

732
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,458
<i>after a young biologist
named Roger Payne</i>

733
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,061
<i>started listening to the song
of the humpback whale.</i>

734
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:16,432
<i>The public knew nothing
about whales at the time.</i>

735
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,437
<i>I mean, scientists knew
that they made sounds.</i>

736
00:47:22,237 --> 00:47:25,875
...20 seconds time...

737
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,378
We'd heard, you know,
a few sounds from a few whales

738
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:32,648
and they were interesting
and, sort of, groovy.

739
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:36,585
<i>But I was in Bermuda
listening for whales</i>

740
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:41,458
<i>and what we heard
was completely different.</i>

741
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:49,259
<i>It was an extremely
emotional experience.</i>

742
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,563
I thought, "My God,
if that won't get the world

743
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:55,666
"interested in whales,
nothing will."

744
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:03,239
<i>So, I had a close friend
who was making records.</i>

745
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:07,509
And I said,
"How would you like to make

746
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,680
"a record of
humpback whales singing?"

747
00:49:11,646 --> 00:49:14,985
<i>And he said, "Sure!"</i>

748
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,153
<i>And it just
became amazingly popular.</i>

749
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:21,023
<i>Everyone had to have a copy.</i>

750
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,561
<i>It was
a multi-platinum record.</i>

751
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,365
<i>Bestselling nature
recording of all time.</i>

752
00:49:29,398 --> 00:49:31,567
And then
National Geographic said,

753
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,771
<i>"We want
10 and a half million copies."</i>

754
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:37,740
<i>Which is the largest single
print order</i>

755
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:39,742
<i>in the history of
the recording industry.</i>

756
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:43,346
<i>The world realized...</i>

757
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,615
...they sing,

758
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:49,418
and when you found out
that they sing,

759
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:50,787
everything changed.

760
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,190
The world changed
around them.

761
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:59,496
<i>Whale song reads as
the presence of intelligence.</i>

762
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:04,501

764
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:10,139
<i>Everyone was touched by it.</i>

765
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,343
<i>It really had that effect.</i>

766
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:15,778
Even the <i>Partridge Family</i>

767
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:18,080
had a whole episode

772
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:45,842
<i>Of course, the time
we're talking about here</i>

773
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:50,380
<i>is the time of protests

<i>in trying to change some of
the problems in the world.</i>

775
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:55,451

of circumstances,

776
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:56,720
that's what you can say
about it.

777
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:02,225
<i>I think the way to start
any movement</i>

778
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:05,561
<i>is you gotta fall in love
first with the species.</i>

779
00:51:08,396 --> 00:51:10,365
<i>We were killing,
at the time I started,</i>

780
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:12,768
<i>about 33,000 whales a year.</i>

781
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:19,175
<i>And then a lot of other groups
took off, like Greenpeace.</i>

782
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,811
<i>Please
stop killing the whales.</i>

783
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:25,248
<i>Without them,
the oceans begin to die</i>

784
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,882
<i>and if the oceans
begin to die,</i>

785
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:29,619
<i>we all begin to die.</i>

786
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,423
<i>And we got it,
eventually,</i>

787
00:51:33,456 --> 00:51:36,226
<i>down to 330 whales a year.</i>

788
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,128
<i>That's 1%.</i>

789
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:42,664
<i>You know, we probably
never would've saved whales</i>

790
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:44,333
<i>unless we heard them sing.</i>

791
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,738
<i>It made people care.</i>

792
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,176
<i>And when people care...</i>

793
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,813
they can change the world.

794
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:03,319
<i>Peace and love
was a very different age.</i>

795
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:06,555
You listen
to what was the dialogue

796
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:08,357
that was going on then.

797
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,461
And it was much more
about all of us.

798
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:22,505
<i>And now we're in a situation</i>

799
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:26,208
<i>where we've,
through one way or another,</i>

800
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:29,146
<i>consciously
isolated ourselves.</i>

801
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:33,449
<i>So if the promise
of the early '60s</i>

802
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:36,652
<i>was communication
with ourselves</i>

803
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,422
<i>in new ways
and with animals...</i>

804
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:43,592
The lonely whale
may be saying, uh,

805
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:46,262
the... the...

806
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:47,864
the wire's been cut.

807
00:53:05,648 --> 00:53:10,220
97, 8 hours, D3, DIFAR.

808
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,421
- Awesome.
- Yeah?

809
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,522
Let's do it.

811
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:18,494
<i>Yeah. Permission granted.</i>

812
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:22,231
All right.

813
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:26,603
<i>We're on
a mission of discovery.</i>

814
00:53:28,536 --> 00:53:30,939
<i>We want to learn something,</i>

815
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:32,507
<i>an answer to a question</i>

816
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:33,943
<i>no one else knows
the answer to,</i>

817
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,213
<i>and this is an opportunity
to do that.</i>

818
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,617
There you go. See it?

819
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:43,519
Boom.

820
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:54,631
It's like you can see
the glow coming up right now!

821
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:55,698
Yeah, you...

822
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:56,766
It's just kinda
sitting there,

823
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:57,733
they're kind of watching it.

824
00:53:57,766 --> 00:53:59,702
They're basically
getting ready to push this.

825
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:05,640
If he were a singer,

826
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,443
there should be another one
showing up.

827
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:09,746
I mean,
he's not letting us down yet.

828
00:54:11,347 --> 00:54:12,382
John, up right.

829
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:21,625
Boom.

830
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,393
That's some back!

831
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:29,965
My preference
would be to trail in a pair.

832
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:36,471
This may be
a really easy on!

833
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:38,340
Yeah,
he's not moving very fast.

834
00:54:39,974 --> 00:54:41,277
Okay, getting ready.

835
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:45,314
Coming up!

836
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:54,290
Too far behind.

837
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:56,960
I thought
they were right in position.

838
00:54:56,992 --> 00:55:00,529
Like, right up swell from him,
ready to go down.

839
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,898
I didn't
quite have a good read.

840
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,699
When you said, "Coming up,"
I thought, "Go,"

841
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,602
but I shouldn't have gone.

842
00:55:07,836 --> 00:55:09,539
Another one up right here.

843
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:17,512
There's another one
just behind it, John.

844
00:55:17,545 --> 00:55:20,549
There's another whale.
This is our pair.

845
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:25,721
Okay, we want trail.

846
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:26,756
Trail.

847
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,501
Looks like they're
gonna try and go for it?

848
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:41,903
Right there.
There he is.

849
00:55:41,936 --> 00:55:43,639
They're going for it.
This is it.

850
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:47,876
John,
we're closing on him.

851
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:49,879
We're closing.

852
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:52,114
Coming up.

853
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:12,902
Boom.

854
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:18,608
Now we'll track the animal
for as long as we can

855
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:20,777
so that even if we
can't see the animal,

856
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:21,844
we can actually
get a good idea

857
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:24,146
of where it's at
and track it down.

858
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:49,105
Yeah, baby!

I feel like
people can relate to it

876
00:58:40,748 --> 00:58:43,718
in a way that you just hear
about this one whale

877
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:46,154
who's never
made any friends,

878
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:49,759
<i>and I think that really,
really resonates with people.</i>

879
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,961
<i>They understand it.</i>

880
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:54,130
<i>Everybody feels
like an outsider</i>

881
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,264
<i>at some point
in their life.</i>

882
00:58:56,931 --> 00:58:59,334
I think that's why so
many people care about it.

883
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:03,072
About him.
Or Doreen, her, as in the song.

884
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:04,139
But really,
what's his name?

885
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:06,107
I guess
it's the 52 Hertz Whale?

886
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:07,108
Does he have a name?

887
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:09,077
The scientists
have called him "52."

888
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,980
52.

889
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:13,148
Huh, he doesn't even have
a real name, he has a number.

890
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:19,855
<i>While many
had been inspired</i>

891
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:21,690
<i>by the notion
of a lonely whale,</i>

892
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:26,862
<i>where does the myth of
this story meet the science?</i>

893
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:33,168
<i>In other words,
could 52 even feel</i>

894
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,838
<i>that so-called human emotion?</i>

895
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,177
<i>Is this whale really lonely?</i>

896
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:45,146
Whales, at least
from a biological perspective,

897
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:48,817
as much as we can tell,
have complex behaviors,

898
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,220
they have
a lot of parental care,

899
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:52,889
they have large brains.

900
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:57,125
<i>So I think
this loneliness idea</i>

901
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,362
<i>is interesting
in that context.</i>

902
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:02,731
<i>On the other hand,</i>

903
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:07,302
I really wouldn't want
to hazard a guess

904
01:00:07,335 --> 01:00:08,870
of whether this creature's

905
01:00:08,903 --> 01:00:12,240
actually emotionally lonely
or not.

906
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:15,844
<i>Whales are social beings.</i>

907
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:17,846
<i>Period.</i>

908
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,816
The fact that
nobody is responding to him

909
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:24,653
absolutely, without a doubt,
this whale is lonely,

910
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:27,889
and that's not being
anthropomorphic.

911
01:00:27,922 --> 01:00:32,127
Yeah, remarkably, if you say
things often enough,

912
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,163
it turns into fact.

913
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:36,699
<i>But we don't have
very much information</i>

914
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:38,900
<i>to make these
broad, general statements.</i>

915
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,404
<i>Any feeling that we have</i>

916
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,673
<i>that we call
"feeling lonely"</i>

917
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:47,710
<i>must be shared

01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:54,050
are basically somewhere
between zero and minus one.

920
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:59,320
<i>We have a
good idea of what sentient is.</i>

921
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:04,726
<i>The sense of awareness,
the sense of self.</i>

922
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,132
<i>A sense of how yourself
can relate to others.</i>

923
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:11,432
<i>In human beings,</i>

924
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,369
<i>we discovered
this particular cell type</i>

925
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:17,072
<i>known as spindle cells.</i>

926
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,875
<i>These are cells
that have to do</i>

927
01:01:19,907 --> 01:01:23,112
<i>with self-awareness
and emotions.</i>

928
01:01:24,445 --> 01:01:26,047
We found that these cells

929
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:29,218
did not exist
only in the human.

930
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:33,289
<i>We found plenty of these
neurons in the large whales.</i>

931
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:37,460
<i>So whether another species
is sentient...</i>

932
01:01:37,492 --> 01:01:39,795
<i>it is possible.</i>

933
01:01:48,936 --> 01:01:50,505
<i>While we may
never know for sure</i>

934
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:53,976
<i>whether 52
has ever felt alone,</i>

935
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:57,179
<i>he was still a symbol
of connection for so many.</i>

936
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:00,450
<i>As he was for me.</i>

937
01:02:05,153 --> 01:02:07,356
<i>Growing up,
I found my connections</i>

938
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:10,425
<i>in stories about the sea.</i>

939
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:13,394
<i>In quest to explore
these underwater worlds</i>

940
01:02:13,427 --> 01:02:16,498
<i>and the mysterious creatures
that lived deep within it.</i>

941
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,835
<i>But now,
on this real-life expedition,</i>

942
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:23,172
<i>on this quest to find 52,</i>

943
01:02:24,338 --> 01:02:27,110
<i>can I see the truth
behind this legend?</i>

944
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:31,480
<i>Only out here
on the open ocean,</i>

945
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,317
<i>have I come to realize</i>

946
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:37,219
<i>we're not just looking
for a lonely whale,</i>

947
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:42,791
<i>but for the most elusive
creature of them all.</i>

948
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,339
Usually,
I'll do a lot of singing.

949
01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:00,543
I talk to the whales
a little more

950
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,012
than if anyone is around.

951
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,313
I really enjoy
being out on the ocean,

952
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:07,249
I really enjoy the adventure,

953
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:08,818
but the excitement is over

954
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,986
trying to learn,
or see something

955
01:03:11,018 --> 01:03:13,855
that no one's been able
to describe before.

956
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:16,925
It's kind of, like,
your claim to meaningfulness

957
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,561
and the sea of humanity
we have.

958
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,221
<i>Looking for clues
as to where</i>

959
01:03:45,253 --> 01:03:48,089
<i>whales may be congregating
in the area,</i>

960
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:50,860
<i>our scientists
attempt to locate a tag...</i>

961
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,061
<i>...that's dislodged</i>

962
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,195
<i>from one of the animals.</i>

963
01:03:54,228 --> 01:03:55,630
CALAMBOKIDIS I don't think
it can be terribly far,

964
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:58,200
because I got beeps
online on the whale.

965
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:02,538
Okay, if you've
got a good read on it,

966
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:16,485
Copy all. I just entered
those numbers,

967
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,554
so we're
7.6 off of those.

968
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:20,590
I think we're gonna have
a fair stab at it.

969
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:37,505
Yeah!

970
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,375
Still recording,
good stuff.

971
01:04:42,244 --> 01:04:45,414
Tag number three
is back in possession.

972
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,682
Okay,
we're going to move again.

973
01:04:47,715 --> 01:04:48,516
Okay, John.

974
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:51,420
So here's our position

975
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:53,688
indicated by
that blue boat.

976
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,925
And we're about to cross
the shipping lane

977
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,660
almost at a right angle.

978
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:01,230
And these green marks
are other vessels,

979
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:03,365
so he's getting
in pretty close company.

980
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,137
What kind of container
ship do you think that is?

981
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,173
That's
a car carrier going to LA,

982
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:16,178
filled with cars, likely
Taiwan, China, or Japan.

983
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,313
And unfortunate,
through chance,

984
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:19,982
this shipping lane
goes right along

985
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:22,083
one of the most common
areas for blue whales.

986
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:32,294
<i>We've had
numerous ship strikes</i>

987
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:34,330
<i>of these animals
in Southern California</i>

988
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:36,230
<i>because there's so much
shipping traffic</i>

989
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:37,566
<i>that comes into that area.</i>

990
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:53,082
<i>We know from
some of our tags</i>

991
01:05:53,114 --> 01:05:56,284
<i>that these whales
do very little response</i>

992
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:58,653
<i>to ships in terms of knowing
how to avoid them.</i>

993
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:02,023
<i>They'll make very little
lateral movement</i>

994
01:06:02,056 --> 01:06:03,358
<i>away from
the track of a ship.</i>

995
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:07,096
<i>So, these huge ships
sometimes,</i>

996
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:10,665
<i>traveling at 25
or more knots,</i>

997
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:14,036
<i>it's clear they're not adapted
to deal with that threat.</i>

998
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,439
<i>The Santa Barbara
shipping lane</i>

999
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:21,677
<i>leads directly to the ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach,</i>

1000
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:25,414
<i>the busiest shipping hub
in the United States.</i>

1001
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:27,782
<i>It accounts for close
to half of all goods</i>

1002
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:30,051
<i>coming into this country.</i>

1003
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:34,389
<i>90% of everything we consume,
everything we eat,</i>

1004
01:06:34,422 --> 01:06:37,158
<i>everything we wear,
everything we live in,</i>

1005
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:39,461
<i>comes to us
from someplace else.</i>

1006
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:43,298
<i>And it comes by sea.</i>

1007
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:47,737
<i>This is chronic.</i>

1008
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:52,008
<i>Always present,
there's noise.</i>

1009
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,210
<i>That's what the ships do.</i>

1010
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:02,451
<i>So, the container ship
will come along,</i>

1011
01:07:02,483 --> 01:07:04,052
<i>and it will absolutely
wipe us out.</i>

1012
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:06,422
<i>'Cause it'll be
so much noise,</i>

1013
01:07:08,322 --> 01:07:10,091
<i>and you just...
There's nothing you can do.</i>

1014
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,460
<i>You just wait
for the ship to go by.</i>

1015
01:07:13,762 --> 01:07:15,131
<i>You get mad,</i>

1016
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:17,466
you get grumpy.

1017
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:23,706
<i>There are other noises from
explosions to look for oil.</i>

1018
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:28,510
<i>We set up sonar
to hunt for submarines.</i>

1019
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:32,614
<i>But the most ubiquitous
are the ships.</i>

1020
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:39,288
<i>The acoustic footprint
from a ship going 30 knots...</i>

1021
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:44,659
<i>There are rings of energy
radiating out from that ship</i>

1022
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,096
<i>that go for 200, 300 miles.</i>

1023
01:07:48,896 --> 01:07:53,335
<i>Sixty years ago,
ship noise didn't exist.</i>

1024
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:57,438
<i>Today, when we think
of all the shipping traffic,</i>

1025
01:07:57,472 --> 01:08:01,276
<i>fifty thousand ships moving
over the surface of the ocean,</i>

1026
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:03,378
<i>and we think
of a really big place,</i>

1027
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:07,215
<i>such as the environment
off Southern California,</i>

1028
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:11,819
<i>Seattle, Philadelphia,
Vancouver,</i>

1029
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:14,690
<i>New York,
on and on and on.</i>

1030
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:19,561
The noise levels
are a thousand times,

1031
01:08:19,594 --> 01:08:22,264
ten thousand times greater

1032
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:24,365
than they would be
under natural conditions.

1033
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,838
<i>So, imagine you're a whale.</i>

1034
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:35,511
<i>Your eyes can only see
your tail, maybe 30 feet away.</i>

1035
01:08:38,313 --> 01:08:41,650
<i>Your ears are what you're
going to pay attention to.</i>

1036
01:08:45,386 --> 01:08:49,190
<i>You can hear the waves
of the shore to your left,</i>

1037
01:08:49,224 --> 01:08:51,193
<i>which indicate the coastline.</i>

1038
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:57,732
<i>You can hear the voices
of other whales...</i>

1039
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,837
<i>...from hundreds
of miles away.</i>

1040
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,310
<i>And in the distance,</i>

1041
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:12,914
<i>the noise
of ships approaching.</i>

1042
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:15,651
<i>You can actually hear
the propellers churning.</i>

1043
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,854
<i>And the noise rises
and rises and rises and rises.</i>

1044
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:22,423
<i>This massive acoustic smog.</i>

1045
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,594
<i>And then,
out of the distance...</i>

1046
01:09:26,694 --> 01:09:30,364
<i>...the sounds of
a seismic air gun array,</i>

1047
01:09:30,398 --> 01:09:34,269
<i>prospecting for oil and gas
beneath the seafloor.</i>

1048
01:09:43,778 --> 01:09:45,914
<i>It drowns out everything</i>

1049
01:09:45,947 --> 01:09:48,917
<i>you could possibly
be listening to.</i>

1050
01:10:10,337 --> 01:10:16,444
<i>Humans, naturally,
we are social beings.</i>

1051
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:19,347
<i>We are intensely social beings,</i>

1052
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:24,820
<i>and we do all kinds of things
in order to be social beings.</i>

1053
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,288
<i>The greatest
joys one can feel</i>

1054
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:30,359
<i>is actually in
the connectivity with life.</i>

1055
01:10:32,493 --> 01:10:35,529
You know perfectly well
the difference between

1056
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:39,533
being in a room
with your friends

1057
01:10:39,567 --> 01:10:42,837
<i>and laughing and singing
and conversing</i>

1058
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:45,774
<i>and knowing that you are
connected with each other.</i>

1059
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:49,310
<i>As opposed to going to
dinner in a restaurant</i>

1060
01:10:49,344 --> 01:10:52,448
<i>and it's so noisy,
you can't hear anything.</i>

1061
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:57,886
<i>We're depriving these animals
of their abilities</i>

1062
01:10:57,918 --> 01:11:00,456
<i>to maintain
their social systems.</i>

1063
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:04,926
<i>What would it feel like</i>

1064
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:06,795
<i>to have your whole world
drowned out,</i>

1065
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:08,764
<i>unable to communicate?</i>

1066
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:13,635
<i>By suffocating
these creatures with noise,</i>

1067
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:17,372
<i>we were creating a whole ocean
of lonely whales.</i>

1068
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:24,011
<i>It was a scourge we witnessed
every day on this expedition,</i>

1069
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:26,849
<i>as it jeopardized our chances
of finding 52</i>

1070
01:11:28,882 --> 01:11:30,452
<i>and we were
running out of time.</i>

1071
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:33,789
<i>We had only
one day left</i>

1072
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,524
<i>and our best option
for locating</i>

1073
01:11:35,556 --> 01:11:37,024
<i>large groups of whales,</i>

1074
01:11:37,057 --> 01:11:39,027
<i>and possibly 52,</i>

1075
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,030
<i>was the evidence retrieved
from one of our tags.</i>

1076
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:48,703
So here's our deployment
from yesterday.

1077
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,538
Really good stuff.

1078
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,873
You know, we were lucky
to even recover this tag,

1079
01:11:52,907 --> 01:11:56,078
because this animal
traveled to the west.

1080
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:59,847
Basically, I think we made
assumptions that were wrong.

1081
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:04,019
My main strategy
was to proceed to the east.

1082
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:07,622
Now we know that 12,
13 miles to the west

1083
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:09,757
are a bunch of whales.

1084
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:27,609
There's actually
a beer in there.

1085
01:12:29,644 --> 01:12:31,079
One lonely beer.

1086
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:37,018
Okay, plan for the day.

1087
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:39,621
Uh, we can already see
white caps out here,

1088
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:42,657
but we're still gonna go out
and try to head west.

1089
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:45,426
So if we get
to this concentration,

1090
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,762
obviously it's gonna be good
to have a sonobuoy out

1091
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:49,631
and listen for 52.

1092
01:12:57,204 --> 01:12:58,407
Yeah, baby!

1093
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:25,500
This is the spot.

1094
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:26,802
Probably one of
the windiest stretches

1095
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,470
in Southern California,

1096
01:13:28,502 --> 01:13:30,037
really hard to get to,

1097
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:33,707
uh, and totally exposed
to the prevailing conditions.

1098
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:50,125
Here we go.

1099
01:14:10,811 --> 01:14:11,979
Copy that. Go ahead.

1100
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:15,050
<i>34 degrees,</i>

1101
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:18,519
<i>11.92, 120 degrees,</i>

1102
01:14:18,552 --> 01:14:19,921
<i>35.15.</i>

1103
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:26,060
Let's see. I don't see
anything just yet.

1104
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:44,779
Stop boat! Stop boat,
stop boat, stop boat!

1105
01:14:44,811 --> 01:14:45,846
Whale up!

1106
01:14:52,252 --> 01:14:53,921
<i>Okay, we're gonna
hang out around these guys</i>

1107
01:14:53,954 --> 01:14:55,122
<i>until we get
a couple good IDs.</i>

1108
01:14:56,157 --> 01:14:57,226
Oh, my God.

1109
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,768
<i>These guys until
we get a couple good IDs.</i>

1110
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:08,103
<i>Okay, we're here.</i>

1111
01:16:00,354 --> 01:16:03,123
I've never seen
anything like this.

1112
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:06,895
We've both been down in
this area for two years now

1113
01:16:06,927 --> 01:16:09,930
and we've had a hard time
finding blue whales at all.

1114
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:11,065
And when we have, it's been

1115
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,068
single individuals
or pairs usually.

1116
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,768
We've never seen
an aggregation

1117
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:16,572
- this big in this area.
- This one, this one. That one

1118
01:16:25,212 --> 01:16:26,947
Yeah, there's a lot
of animals out there,

1119
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,617
I don't know if you guys
have looked outside.

1120
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:29,884
Yeah, everywhere.

1121
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,319
We're surrounded.

1122
01:16:31,351 --> 01:16:33,055
Yeah, it's a good day.

1123
01:16:35,756 --> 01:16:36,657
Whoa,
what was that?

1124
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,196
What was that?
What was on its dorsal fin?

1125
01:16:54,341 --> 01:16:56,076
If you look out
the front...

1126
01:16:56,109 --> 01:16:58,045
- Oh, my God!
- ...it's just in front of us.

1127
01:16:58,078 --> 01:16:59,380
You see the footprint?

1128
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:00,681
- See where the water is kind of smooth?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1129
01:17:00,715 --> 01:17:01,449
- That's right there.
- That's where they surface.

1130
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,318
He's headed
to the left there.

1131
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:04,652
That's amazing.

1132
01:17:05,386 --> 01:17:06,755
What'd he say, Dave?

1133
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:07,955
He said,
"Yeah, hang tight."

1134
01:17:07,988 --> 01:17:09,390
If we have one
that's a potential hybrid,

1135
01:17:09,423 --> 01:17:11,826
like, hang tight,
let's go check that out.

1136
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:13,862
- Is he gonna come over?
- He's coming over.

1137
01:17:19,367 --> 01:17:22,104
The second one...
The sensor isn't as deep.

1138
01:17:23,371 --> 01:17:24,739
- Channel...
- Right.

1139
01:17:29,844 --> 01:17:31,145
How come
there's nothing here?

1140
01:17:47,127 --> 01:17:50,898
We're just waiting
for the whales to speak to us.

1141
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:52,934
There's nobody at the surface
right now.

1142
01:17:58,072 --> 01:17:59,474
This is really bad.

1143
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:01,143
Really bad, bad, bad.

1144
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:20,362
<i>It's a
ship coming down the channel.</i>

1145
01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:07,842
I mean,
if there is any opportunity

1146
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,010
to come back here,

1147
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,814
looking for the 52 Hertz Whale,

1148
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:17,752
I would say this is our
highest priority area to work.

1149
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:24,458
Between what we've observed
before and what we saw today,

1150
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:26,394
makes it very intriguing
to work here.

1151
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,336
<i>We all fear risk.</i>

1152
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,873
<i>The risk of believing
in something</i>

1153
01:20:12,907 --> 01:20:14,476
<i>that just may
not come true.</i>

1154
01:20:17,878 --> 01:20:20,347
<i>I truly believed
I was going to find 52...</i>

1155
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:25,487
<i>And I won't say
it didn't matter,</i>

1156
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:28,089
<i>because it did.</i>

1157
01:20:29,556 --> 01:20:32,260
<i>I was gonna be the one
to solve this mystery,</i>

1158
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:35,430
<i>to find that answer.</i>

1159
01:20:37,398 --> 01:20:38,500
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

1160
01:20:52,145 --> 01:20:54,581
Hey, Scott.
Is Bruce on as well?

1161
01:20:54,614 --> 01:20:55,617
- <i>I am.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

1162
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:23,243
- In 2004,
- Mm-hm.

1163
01:21:23,277 --> 01:21:25,512
- we came right out here off San Miguel...
- Mm-hmm.

1164
01:21:25,546 --> 01:21:28,016
...and we encountered a big
group of blue and fin whales,

1165
01:21:28,048 --> 01:21:30,217
and in amongst them,
paired with a blue whale,

1166
01:21:30,251 --> 01:21:33,488
was this whale that looked
in between the two.

1167
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,373
Hey, Bruce.
Remember we were saying

1168
01:21:52,405 --> 01:21:54,074
how hard it would be
to find this whale

1169
01:21:54,108 --> 01:21:55,610
and here we are,
like, four years later,

1170
01:21:55,643 --> 01:21:57,511
and we've, kind of, almost,

1171
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,346
extremely close
to finding this whale.

1172
01:22:30,543 --> 01:22:33,613
Well, if you put together
Bruce's data that tells us

1173
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:36,250
where the whale is
at a particular time,

1174
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:38,686
with the underwater
sound data

1175
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,389
from the site
that we've maintained,

1176
01:22:41,421 --> 01:22:43,457
you could make
some sort of correspondence

1177
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:47,095
to say when the whale
was near the sensor,

1178
01:22:47,127 --> 01:22:48,695
what sort of song
did we hear?

1179
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:50,765
When do you think
you'll be able to look

1180
01:22:50,797 --> 01:22:52,766
at the data
from this HARP?

1181
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,235
It usually takes
a couple of weeks.

1182
01:22:55,269 --> 01:22:57,105
Before Thanksgiving
we should know.

1183
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:07,248
It's an amazing
set of events.

1184
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,449
Yeah. We couldn't have
planned it this way.

1185
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:12,119
What are
the chances of this happening?

1186
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,489
<i>We now had
one last opportunity</i>

1187
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:17,625
<i>to prove our expedition
hadn't been in vain.</i>

1188
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,130
<i>To finish the work
Watkins had started.</i>

1189
01:23:23,463 --> 01:23:26,100
<i>And to prove
all these years of searching</i>

1190
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,570
<i>have been worth it.</i>

1191
01:23:32,105 --> 01:23:35,309
<i>Every story
has an ending,</i>

1192
01:23:35,341 --> 01:23:38,479
<i>even if it wasn't the one
you expected.</i>

1193
01:24:11,878 --> 01:24:13,581
<i>So you're saying</i>

1194
01:24:13,613 --> 01:24:19,619
<i>that you know when the whale
went over this HARP?</i>

1195
01:24:19,653 --> 01:24:21,356
<i>That whale
that they tagged?</i>

1196
01:24:23,123 --> 01:24:25,760
<i>So we have a station</i>

1197
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:27,828
<i>off of Point Conception,</i>

1198
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:29,663
<i>and it's that station</i>

1199
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:33,167
where the tagged whale
from Bruce

1200
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,735
passed right over the top
of our sensor.

1201
01:24:35,769 --> 01:24:39,407
He only had it tagged
for a few weeks

1202
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,376
and we looked at those
time periods really carefully.

1203
01:24:44,912 --> 01:24:48,449
The times that Bruce's whale
swam over our instrument,

1204
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:52,186
it was not singing.

1205
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:57,158
Okay. You're sure?

1206
01:25:02,496 --> 01:25:05,565
The absence of
those calls doesn't mean that,

1207
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:07,268
you know,
the whale wasn't there.

1208
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:10,637
<i>It just wasn't calling.</i>

1209
01:25:15,341 --> 01:25:16,710
<i>We had an opportunity.</i>

1210
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:21,583
<i>But, you know,
all the stars did not align.</i>

1211
01:25:28,622 --> 01:25:30,291
So, this was the bad news.

1212
01:25:31,225 --> 01:25:33,194
What do you mean?

1213
01:25:33,226 --> 01:25:34,362
We do have some good news.

1214
01:25:36,529 --> 01:25:39,367
We were looking at
the data from the other sites

1215
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:44,139
and we saw
the 52 Hertz Whale calling.

1216
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:46,507
This is off of Los Angeles.

1217
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:51,945
Now, at the same time,
off of San Diego,

1218
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:55,283
we have here,
similar image,

1219
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:56,884
again, several minutes
of data,

1220
01:25:56,917 --> 01:26:00,387
and you see these
same little marks.

1221
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:02,423
And this is within ten
minutes of each other

1222
01:26:02,456 --> 01:26:04,926
that we hear
the Watkins Whale

1223
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:08,229
in two locations that
are about 90 miles apart.

1224
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:13,367
These are completely
different sequences

1225
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:14,635
- at the same time.
- At the same time.

1226
01:26:18,605 --> 01:26:19,673
<i>It's a culture.</i>

1227
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,877
<i>You could say whale
sounds are a language,</i>

1228
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:29,716
but they also have to listen
to each other and synchronize.

1229
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:33,854
<i>And so, who is the 52 Hertz
Whale synchronizing with?</i>

1230
01:26:34,921 --> 01:26:36,190
It's not just one.

1231
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:39,394
There's at least two.

1232
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:43,331
Two 52 Hertz Whales.

1233
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:45,233
There are two.

1234
01:26:48,769 --> 01:26:49,871
Probably more.

1235
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:00,114
<i>We might
never have known</i>

1236
01:27:00,146 --> 01:27:02,783
<i>there was more than
one 52 Hertz Whale</i>

1237
01:27:02,815 --> 01:27:04,851
<i>had we not heard
this one call out.</i>

1238
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:08,456
<i>With a voice
that cut through the noise,</i>

1239
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:10,925
<i>that demanded
to be heard.</i>

1240
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:15,796
<i>A voice that reminded us</i>

1241
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:18,465
<i>the ocean
is not a lonely place.</i>

1242
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:28,408
<i>Our discovery
only proves</i>

1243
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:31,545
<i>that Watkins was right
all along.</i>

1244
01:27:31,578 --> 01:27:34,582
<i>In the ocean,
what we can hear</i>

1245
01:27:34,614 --> 01:27:38,019
<i>is truly far more powerful
than what we can see.</i>

1246
01:27:39,386 --> 01:27:42,657
<i>And it resonates
with a mysterious beauty</i>

1247
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:45,960
<i>that we are only just
beginning to understand.</i>

1248
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,876
<i>The 52 Hertz
still is a mystery,</i>

1249
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,379
<i>but I think it's important
to do things</i>

1250
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:08,449
<i>where you don't know
what the answer's going to be,</i>

1251
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:10,284
because that's where
you really learn something.

1252
01:28:11,984 --> 01:28:13,420
<i>You have billions of people</i>

1253
01:28:13,453 --> 01:28:14,988
<i>on this planet.</i>

1254
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:17,324
<i>Where can you
carve out a unique,</i>

1255
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,393
<i>meaningful role
for yourself</i>

1256
01:28:19,426 --> 01:28:22,063
where you can kind of find
this thing out and share it.

1257
01:28:27,868 --> 01:28:30,004
<i>It may take
a long time,</i>

1258
01:28:30,037 --> 01:28:31,706
<i>but we're going to find
this animal.</i>

1259
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:35,976
<i>After years
of endless searching,</i>

1260
01:28:36,976 --> 01:28:38,546
<i>after years of calling out,</i>

1261
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:41,815
<i>52 finally had his answer</i>

1262
01:28:42,548 --> 01:28:44,585
<i>and I had mine.</i>

1263
01:28:49,722 --> 01:28:52,627
That's the... That's the
ultimate question, isn't it?

1264
01:28:54,127 --> 01:28:58,799
<i>It's not about biology
and it's not about science.</i>

1265
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:04,372
<i>It's about ourselves.</i>

1266
01:29:04,404 --> 01:29:07,074
<i>It's about our own ability
to communicate</i>

1267
01:29:08,841 --> 01:29:11,612
<i>and our own isolation.</i>

1268
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,115
<i>It's a human experience,</i>

1269
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:20,387
<i>a reflection
of who we are.</i>

1270
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:24,759
This whale
isn't lonely.

1271
01:29:26,827 --> 01:29:30,465
<i>This story is about
all of us.</i>

1272
01:29:33,033 --> 01:29:36,604
<i>To some,
this whale was a hybrid.</i>

1273
01:29:36,636 --> 01:29:39,373
<i>To others,
he was an outsider,</i>

1274
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:43,177
<i>or even a legend.</i>

1275
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:46,547
<i>Yet, in our search,
we found a new story,</i>

1276
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:50,717
<i>not just one of connection,
but more so interconnection.</i>

1277
01:29:51,918 --> 01:29:53,854
<i>We used
to call this creature</i>

1278
01:29:53,886 --> 01:29:55,555
<i>"the loneliest whale
in the world,"</i>

1279
01:29:56,155 --> 01:29:57,492
<i>but after today,</i>

1280
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:01,429
<i>he's better
known as 52.</i>

1281
01:30:03,095 --> 01:30:05,532
<i>And if you ever want
to find him,</i>

1282
01:30:05,565 --> 01:30:08,469
<i>all you have to do
is listen.</i>

1283
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:17,605
I have
at least 20 blue whales

1284
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:18,972
feeding in this area.

1285
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:24,479
Animals present
in all directions around us.

1286
01:31:41,694 --> 01:31:43,563
Mother and calf
blue whale.

1287
01:31:54,173 --> 01:31:55,809
Can't tell if that's
him yet or not.

1288
01:31:55,841 --> 01:31:56,978
Yeah,
I don't know.

1289
01:31:58,744 --> 01:31:59,813
Pretty light colored,

1290
01:31:59,845 --> 01:32:00,981
I don't think
that's him.

1291
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,651
Oh, maybe.

1292
01:32:05,886 --> 01:32:08,255
Any visual underwater?

1293
01:32:08,287 --> 01:32:09,890
- Definitely him.
- That's him.

1294
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:13,861
That's our hybrid
surfacing right there.

1295
01:32:19,832 --> 01:32:22,135
That's our blue-fin hybrid
in the foreground.

1296
01:32:23,837 --> 01:32:24,906
That's him.

1297
01:32:43,559 --> 01:32:48,559
