詹森一家人扯上关系的?

45
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,940
他们的妈妈离家出走以后
I was cleaning for them part time,

46
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:12,677
我兼职做起了他们家的保洁阿姨
right when his mamma ran off.

47
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:16,084
然后沃德和我 沃德是哥哥
And Ward and I, Ward was his brother,

48
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,316
他那时还在读高中

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,358
我们两个一起照顾他

50
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:23,155
小杰克那时候才五岁

51
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,924
那他的父亲呢?
Where was his father?

52
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,558
老詹森那时候
W.W. was just

53
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,226
在追一个姑娘 你懂的
chasing girls, you know.

54
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:32,532
而且还在办一份当地的报纸
And running the local newspaper.

55
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:37,439
叫做护城河县论坛报
The Moat County Tribune.

56
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,170
沃德他好吗?
How's Ward?

57
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:42,680
挺好的 就是很忙
He's good, he's good. Real busy.

58
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:44,648
沃德是一个作家...
Ward was a writer...

59
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:49,881
为迈阿密时报工作
uh... for the Miami Times.

60
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:53,322
他常常写一些关于...
He used to write about, uh...

61
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:55,553
其实那时候他还是小有名气的
well, he was kind of famous, you know,

62
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:59,620
因为他写的都是关于民权运动的文章
'cause he wrote about the Civil Rights Movement

63
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,998
为穷人和不公正事件打抱不平
and the poor and the unjustly accused.

64
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,731
所以后来夏洛特女士
That's how come that lady Charlotte

65
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,739
才会写信给他
started writing letters to him.

66
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,968
然后发生了这样那样的事
Stuff like that.

67
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,806
是的
Yeah.

68
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,143
再后来杰克 像我说的一样 他是一个游泳运动员
And then Jack, like I said, he was a swimmer.

69
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,615
而且...
And, uh...

70
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:20,413
他游得很好 几乎是专业水准 但是
almost professional, very close but then

71
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,077
他还是被游泳队开除了
he got kicked off the swim team,

72
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:24,554
他还被大学开除了
he got kicked out of college,

73
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,491
他只能回到家 在爸爸的报社当报童
and he came back home to his papa's house to deliver newspapers.

74
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,423
他是很不愿意回家的
He didn't want to come back home,

75
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,088
但是除了家他无处可去

76
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,508
杰克 你的音乐太大声了

stirring up shit with that asshole.

126
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,606
我只想说认识到这点

00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,863
你还在跟那个监狱里的\佬通信吗?
That's that nigger you've been writing?

138
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,837
不 这回是个白人
No. This is my white man.

139
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,464
哦
Ohhh.

140
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,999
昨天发生了什么? 我好像错过了什么好事
What happened yesterday? I missed it.

141
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,137
听着这句 他觉得 我就是他的天使
Listen to this. He thinks I'm his angel.

142
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:38,705
- 他的天使?  - 嘘嘘嘘 闭嘴听下去
- His angel?  - Shhh. Shut your face.

143
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:41,514
- 这货今年几岁啦?  - 哦 我的天哪
- Bitch, how old is he?  - Oh, my God.

144
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,283
- 这个老东西对你很中意啊  - "如果人世间真的有天使存在的话
- He's a fine motherfucker that's trying to fuck you.  - "Ever there was an angel in the world,

145
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:47,325
那一定是你 我的天使
my angel, it must be you,

146
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:51,123
但是没有天使会愿意做 我希望你做的事
but no angel would do the things I dream that you want."

147
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:54,688
你是天使 他的天使
Your angel, his angel.

148
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,132
- 嗯  - 写得真好
- Mm-hm.  - That's hot.

149
00:07:57,202 --> 00:08:02,799
他说 "如果你真的存在 那我就去信教去"
He say, "If you truly exist, I may become a religious man."

150
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,239
啊哈!
Ah!

151
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,077
"穷尽一生 我的心只想找一个港湾"
"All my life, my heart has tried to find a place

152
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,782
我想是叫做... 家的地方"
I cannot name... a home."

153
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:20,086
你最好给你自己找个年轻点的
You need to find yourself a young one.

154
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:21,648
那样他才能满足你
He'll fuck you real good.

155
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,162
- 他说我是他的家  - 恩恩
- He says I'm his home.  - Hm.

156
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:27,858
从在监狱里服刑的
Got a hundred different men

157
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,798
一百个男人中挑选出的一个
writing her from the penitentiary.

158
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,165
这就是她的男人
That's her man.

159
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:34,728
哦 不 这才是我男人
Oh, no. This is my man.

160
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,536
这就是我缘定今生的人
This here's the one.

161
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:39,076
呵呵
Mm-hm.

162
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:44,476
沃德回到家去调查
Ward came home to investigate

163
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,983
希拉里・范・维特的罪行
the conviction of Hillary Van Wetter.

164
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:49,452
当地人对这事都很排斥
The town wasn't too happy about it

165
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,887
- 而且他的爸爸也不支持这样做  - 哦 算了吧
- and neither was his papa.  - Oh, shit. Ugh.

166
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,895
沃德...
Ward...

167
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:01,330
有匹马在停车位里
there's a horse in the parking lot.

168
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,594
我们就骑着它回家吧 亚德利
It's our ride home, Yardley.

169
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,270
额 人们都到哪儿去了?
Uh, where is everybody?

170
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,364
今天是周日
It's Sunday.

171
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:11,807
人们要么在家 要么在做礼拜
People's either at home or at church.

172
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:21,041
真不走运
It's a shithole.

173
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,495
嘿 兄弟
Hey, man.

174
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:38,730
嘿 是你呀
Hey, you.

175
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:42,139
最近还好吗?
How you doing?

176
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,970
- 杰克 这是我朋友亚德利・阿奇曼  - 你好
- Jack, meet Yardley Acheman.  - Hey.

177
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,510
- 这是我弟弟 杰克  - 游泳健将 对吗?
- My little brother, Jack.  - The swimmer, right?

178
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:51,038
- 是的 他现在是我们的司机哦  - 好的 太好了
- Yeah, he's our driver now.  - Right, good.

179
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:53,380
上车吧 我来拿行李
Here, let me get these.

180
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,615
- 那是我的打字机  - 你越长越壮了
- That's my typewriter.  - You've gotten big, boy.

181
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:59,247
打字机可得轻拿轻放哦
Just be careful with the typewriter.

182
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:02,521
还是那么有精神呢 是因为常游泳吗?
Got all pumped up. Is that from swimming?

183
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,528
现在不游了
Not anymore.

184
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:13,570
错了! 错了! 不对呀!
No! No! No!

185
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:15,902
亚德利很爱惜他的西服哦
Yardley's real particular about his suits

186
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,909
- 还有他的打字机  - 是的呢 它很贵哦
- and his typewriter.  - Well, it's very expensive.

187
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,904
谢谢你
Yes. Thank you.

188
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:29,052
我怎么坐进去?
How do I get in?

189
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:33,323
当心头 别磕到了
Watch your head. Watch your head.

190
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:36,792
- 别碰我的头  - 告诉他你是哪里人 亚德利
- Don't touch my head.  - Tell him where you're from, Yardley.

191
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:39,692
我是从伦敦来的
London.

192
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,561
原来如此!
Ah!

193
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,863
我从纽约... 来这儿的时候
When I came here... from New York,

194
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,302
我来这儿应聘这份工作...
I was interviewing for the job...

195
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:50,068
我在纽约做的是广告方面的工作
and I was in advertising in New York,

196
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:54,373
我指出 这里的广告业和纽约的不太一样
and I mentioned that it was simply different in New York.

197
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,275
那是什么驱使你从纽约市
So how'd you get from New York City

198
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:04,117
来到后来的大都市 佛罗里达的呢?
to the metropolis of Lately, Florida?

199
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:08,817
詹森宅邸
Jansen residence.

200
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:12,226
所以我一路南下而且应聘了报社的工作
So I came down South and I interviewed at the paper.

201
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,822
詹森先生 罗伯塔小姐打电话找你
W.W., Miss Roberta's on the phone.

202
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,833
不 不 不
No, no, no.

203
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,541
- 我们不接电话  - 安妮塔...
- We don't take phone calls.  - Anita...

204
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:20,127
- 谁是罗伯塔小姐?  - 我们不接电话 安妮塔
- Who's Miss Roberta?  - No calls, Anita.

205
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,977
你是从伦敦哪一个地区来的 亚德利?
What part of London you from, Yardley?

206
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:32,005
额 伦敦我都很熟
Um, all over London.

207
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,381
- 这里有好一点的干洗店吗?  - 你是说?
- Is there a good dry cleaning here?  - Excuse me?

208
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,046
干洗店
Dry cleaning.

209
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:39,113
- 干洗店?  - 是的
- Dry cleaning?  - Yes.

210
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,057
- 你吃的差不多了 是吗?  - 是的
- You ain't gonna eat that, are you?  - Uh-uh.

211
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,789
你不吃饭怎么能赢得游泳比赛呢?
How you gonna win those swimming meets if you don't eat?

212
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,928
我已经退役了
I'm retired.

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,299
退役了 杰克 你还没累到要退役吧
Retired. Jack, you ain't even tired enough to be retired.

214
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,936
你们工作具体是干什么的?
How is it exactly you guys work?

215
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:04,004
比如报道 某个男孩因入会仪式而溺死
I mean, like that boy drowned at his initiation?

216
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:09,017
是这样 亚德利是一名作家...
Well, Yardley's the writer...

217
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:12,820
沃德可以说是 负责搜集素材的
And I'd guess you'd say Ward is the nuts and bolts.

218
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,825
是的 当我还是记者的时候
Yeah. When I was a reporter,

219
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:17,088
我们会请改稿员通过电话把故事记录下来
we had rewrite men who took the stories over the phone.

220
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,289
不 不 不 我不是改稿员
No, no, no. I'm not a rewrite man.

221
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,093
我就是作家
I'm the writer.

222
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,260
我就是要把事实呈现在公众面前
I'm the one who puts the facts into perspective.

223
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:25,996
哦!
Oh!

224
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:28,539
是的 现在时代不同了 詹森先生
Yes. It's a different world now, Mr. Jansen.

225
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:34,074
显而易见
Clearly.

226
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:36,079
今时不同往日了呢
Times have changed a bit, sir.

227
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,978
"迈阿密时报"到底
What interest does "The Miami Times"

228
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,609
对希拉里・范・维特有什么兴趣呢?
have in Hillary Van Wetter?

229
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:42,277
他在狱中杀人了吗?
He murdered somebody in jail?

230
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:44,480
即使他是个罪犯...
Even if he was guilty...

231
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,996
- 但显而易见 他被处以私刑...  - 他也是有人权的
- It was a lynching, pure and simple.  - he had certain rights.

232
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,083
而且就算他是有罪之人
And even if he was guilty...

233
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,527
希拉里还是享有不容忽视的权利的
Hillary has rights that the process completely disregarded.

234
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:55,361
这就是我们此行的原因
And that's why we're here.

235
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:58,732
很抱歉 各位 但是我真的得走了
I'm very sorry, everybody, but I'm going to have to leave.

236
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:00,794
抱歉 亲爱的
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

237
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:03,238
我明天一大早还得去做评估呢
I have early evaluations first thing in the morning.

238
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:04,741
- 靠近点 亲爱的  - 我真的很抱歉
- Come here, sugar.  - I apologize.

239
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,935
那就到这儿吧
All right, buddy.

240
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,348
沃德?
Ward?

241
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,576
晚安了 孩子们
Good night, boys.

242
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,010
沃德?
Ward?

243
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,454
看来他没意识到自己的肤色问题
Seems mighty sure of himself for a colored.

244
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,363
沃德说他们需要一个司机
Ward said they need a driver.

245
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,958
一个司机?
A driver?

246
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,162
你在外面到底是干什么的?
What you do out there?

247
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:36,036
你在迈阿密交新朋友了吗?
So you meet anybody new out there in Miami?

248
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:41,236
是有那么几个
I met a few.

249
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:44,611
- 哦  - 那里各种各样的人都有 你知道的?
- Oh, yeah.  - All types down there, you know?

250
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,309
你要离那些凶巴巴的人远一点
You stay away from those rough ones.

251
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,284
还记得上次发生的事情吗
Remember what happened the last time.

252
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,516
你的孩子们现在怎么样?
How your kids?

253
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:53,352
你看起来还是很漂亮 宝贝
You look beautiful, babe.

254
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:56,393
他们过的不错 日子过的很舒坦
They're doing good. They're doing really good.

255
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,224
我今晚下班以后
As soon as I get out of here,

256
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:02,494
回去看看他们 然后再给他们做一顿晚饭
I'll go see them and make dinner all over again.

257
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,526
你啥时候也一起来吃饭吧
You should come to that dinner, too.

258
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,030
我会去吃晚饭的呢
I'll come to that dinner.

259
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:14,204
我想你走的时候...
I think Ellen is maybe number four...

260
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,769
艾伦才四岁吧
since you left.

261
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:18,945
嗯
Yeah.

262
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,076
所以不能把这帮小崽子当回事
That's why I don't take them bitches too seriously.

263
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,679
他们来来去去 来来去去的
They come and they go and they come and they go.

264
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:27,088
知道吧?
You know what I mean?

265
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:44,539
- 还行吗 亚德?  - 唉哟
- How you doing there, Yard?  - Oh, jeez.

266
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:55,650
嘿 小伙 把门关上啊
Hey, close that door, boy.

267
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,847
省得你爸又要吵吵
I don't want your daddy screaming about all the flies

268
00:14:57,922 --> 00:14:59,321
苍蝇都放进屋了
getting in the house.

269
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,551
呵
Hmm.

270

He's an innocent man. You're gonna find that out.

323

他坐的是冤狱
Wrongly convicted.

324
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,340
这些对我们来说是个很好的开始

- 我做了大量调查  - 看得出

In the meantime, you need to freshen up or anything?

327
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,767
- 杰克 带布莱斯小姐去洗手间  - 不 我就待这儿吧
- Jack, show Miss Bless to the washroom.  - No, I think I'll just stay here.

328
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,244
有些问题可能还得跟你说下
You might have some questions that you need answered.

329
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,803
在这儿我也能修妆

你们会发现 呃...
You'll see, uh...

335
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,857
箱子里的文件数量非常庞大
it's an enormous amount of work what's with the boxes.

336
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:53,454
我不知道在这儿干嘛 这些箱子干嘛的?
I don't know what to do here. What's with the boxes?

337
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,658
呃 我们得从这些箱子开始
Well, we're gonna start on it.

338
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:59,191
杰克他爱上了夏洛特・布莱斯
My Jack was in love with Charlotte Bless.

339
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,965
这淫娃 瞅人第一眼
I could tell that horny little boy

340
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,507
就想把人压倒在身下
wanted to jump her on first sight.

341
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:08,534
谁也搞不清 她怎么会跟希拉里・范・维特订婚
Everybody was confused why she was engaged to Hillary Van Wetter.

342
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:11,912
龌蹉 这白人下流胚烦着呢
Nasty, white trash swamp.

343
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:14,315
"给我写信的那些杀人犯
"All the killers who have written me,

344
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,479
他们只会想着舌抵玉户
want to press their mouths into my vagina,

345
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:20,514
顶烂我的屁股
and some, even the crack of my behind,

346
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,220
可希拉里・范・维特不这样
except Hillary Van Wetter.

347
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,390
他没这淫念
He has no such desire.

348
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:30,595
他想别人给他做口活
He wants to be sucked off himself.

349
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:33,865
我想这种心理证明了他的清白"
I consider this psychological proof of his innocence."

350
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:38,433
她可真够淫邪
She is one nasty little nut job.

351
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:41,034
咱是不是太拿她当回事了
Think we've been taking her a little too seriously.

352
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:43,205
你这么快就耐不住了
You sure get bored quick.

353
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:45,281
不 我可不想在这佛罗里达的破地方
No. Can tell I'm not going to get laid anytime soon

354
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:48,251
搞点风流韵事 所以...
in this Floridian shit pit, so...

355
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,446
- 听着...  - 嘿 凯西 是我
- Listen...  - Hey, Kathy, it's me.

356
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:52,455
希拉里跟她说 警方声称在他屋里
Hillary tells her that the knife

357
00:18:52,523 --> 00:18:54,582
- 我是亚德利啊  - ...找到的刀子
- Yardley.  - ...and the bloodied shirt,

358
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,150
沾血的衬衫
that the deputies claim to have found in his house,

359
00:18:57,228 --> 00:19:00,322
在开庭审理前都不翼而飞了
somehow got lost before the trial.

360
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,389
嗯 我也想你
Yeah, I miss you, too.

361
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,230
什么?
What?

362
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,767
你好 凯西
Hello, Kathy.

363
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,901
布莱斯小姐想去监狱外面看看
Miss Bless wanted to look at the prison.

364
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:14,536
杰克的第一个任务就是送她过去
Jack's first assignment was to take her there.

365
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,641
我猜他知道我在这儿
I bet he knows I'm here.

366
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:19,706
呐 两个人如果以非常方式...
See, people who fall in love outside...

367
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,753
陷入爱河
of a normal relationship,

368
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,588
他们会有感应...　心灵感应
they have these powers... telepathic powers.

369
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:31,753
希拉里和我有那种感应 你懂得?
Hillary and I have that kind of connection, you dig?

370
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:43,066
你为啥不在大学念书呢?
Now why ain't you in college?

371
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,802
啊?
Huh?

372
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:47,811
啊 我上学那会儿是练游泳的
Uh, I was a swimmer when I was in school.

373
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:49,608
- 真假?  - 是哦
- No kidding?  - Yeah.

374
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,773
- 我也是练游泳的  - 是吗?
- I was a swimmer.  - You were?

375
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,714
当然 要不是我这该死的卷发
Uh-huh. I'd swim like a mermaid,

376
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:57,447
我一定是游泳健将
if it wasn't for my damn curly hair.

377
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:59,513
给我授课的都是直发
I think straight hair gives me class.

378
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,252
好吧
All right.

379
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:04,453
不错
Good.

380
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:07,997
那?
So?

381
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:10,795
呃 有天晚上我们喝醉了 然后... 嗯...
Well, we was drunk one night, and, uh...

382
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:16,138
我...
I just...

383
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:18,141
我闹脾气 就...
I lost my temper and just...

384
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:21,509
呃 就把池子给放空了
well, I emptied the pool.

385
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,036
大学吗?
At your college?

386
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:24,638
佛罗里达大学
The University of Florida.

387
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:30,686
我想他们把这视作故意毁坏
They called that vandalism, I guess.

388
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:33,155
做这事可不是听上去那么简单
It's actually not as easy to do as it sounds.

389
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,655
那你经常闹脾气了?
So you lose your temper often?

390
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,123
嗯
Mm.

391

这地方每个小伙都和你一样
This place is full of boys just like you,

392
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,563
在某一天 闹脾气了

393
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:52,969

394
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:55,577
哦 宝贝
Oh, baby.

395
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,906
他估计也是欲火中烧
I bet he's horny for me all the time.

396
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,541

400
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,096

402

We just wanted to sit in your parking lot for a little while.

403
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,168
为嘛?
What for?

404
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,735
他爸关在这儿 我们给他传送点感应
His daddy's in there and we wanted to send him good vibrations.

405
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:30,872
传送啥?
Some good what?

406
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:35,612
哦 那种特别的心灵感应
Oh, these special things called good vibrations.

407
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,483
对不起 女士 你们不能在这儿停车
Sorry, ma'am. Y'all can't park here.

408
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:40,888
哦
Oh.

409
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,552
好的 警官
Yes, Officer.

410
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:54,731
警方并未去证实
The story that Hillary told the deputies

411
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:57,433
希拉里提及的细节
was never investigated.

412
00:21:57,475 --> 00:22:00,205
这事他只在证人席说过
He simply told it once from the witness stand,

413
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,905
也没人让他详细陈述
and was never asked to elaborate,

414
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,879
包括他自己的律师
not even by his own lawyers.

415
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:20,388
- 很高兴再次见到你 沃德  - 很高兴见到您
- Good to see you again, Ward.  - Nice to see you.

416
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:32,404
先生 这是我的合作搭档 亚德利・阿奇曼先生
Sir, this is my writing partner, Mr. Yardley Acheman.

417
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:41,141
当然
Of course.

418
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:43,186
我想我们最好
I suppose the best place to start,

419
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:44,949
从头说起
would be the beginning.

420
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:46,649
我1897年出生在这座县城
I was born in this county.

421
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:51,161
我的父母人穷志不穷
1897, to poor but proud parents.

422
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,890
派恩先生 咱能省点时间
Mr. Pine, could we skip 65 years,

423
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:55,693
把这65年略过吗?
save everyone some time?

424
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,635
希拉里・范・维特1965年的案件?
Hillary Van Wetter, 1965?

425
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:03,265
哦 未经当事人的允许
Oh, I can't agree to talk to you about that matter.

426
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,434
我不能和你们讨论这件事
Not without my client's permission.

427
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,275
他也和大家一样 享有隐私权
He's entitled to his privacy, just like anybody else.

428
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,111
- 你们经过他的允许了  - 他给你写过信
- You have his permission.  - He wrote you.

429
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,344
我得查一下
I'll have to check that out.

430
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:16,818
我确信这些信就在你的案底里 派恩先生
I'm sure the letters would be in your files, Mr. Pine.

431
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:19,014
你是这么说 可我得保护我的当事人
That's what you say, but I have a client to protect.

432
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:23,419
这样
Look here.

433
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:25,826
如果我们非得找个律师
If we have to get a lawyer of our own down here

434
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:28,160
整理出这些案底 那么到时候
to sort this out, then while he's here,

435
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:32,896
我们就得让他彻底调查范・维特先生的案子
we're gonna have him look through every aspect of Mr. Van Wetter's case.

436
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,530
包括他的辩护能力
Including the competency of his defense.

437
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:38,575
希拉里・范・维特在法庭上的辩护没有任何问题
There was nothing wrong with the defense Hillary Van Wetter got in court!

438
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:41,133
那你就更没啥好顾虑的了
Then you have nothing to worry about from us.

439
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,509
我们只想和他谈谈
We just want to talk to him.

440
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,172
然后我们就离开你的...
Then we'll be out of your...

441
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:45,977
你根本不了解这个人!
You don't know a thing about this person!

442
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,578
你还嫩着点 小伙!
You've been in this world for five minutes, boy!

443
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:53,851
你不必这样 派恩先生
Now that's just not necessary, Mr. Pine.

444
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:56,154
是 这是我的办公室 我想怎么说就怎么说!
Yes. I talk the way I want in my office!

445
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,388
好吧 那您会安排我们见面的 是吧?
All right. Then you'll arrange the meeting, will you?

446
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:05,766
快点! 我们来不及了!
Quick! We're gonna be late!

447
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:10,532
你拿结婚证了?
You get the marriage license?

448
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:36,162
这真让人不敢相信!
I can't believe we're doing this!

449
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,132
操! 杰克 再去敲下门吧
Fuck! Jack, go knock on the door again.

450
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:47,667
她来了 喔 宝贝
There she is. Whoa, baby

451
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,346
- 呵 我说吧...  - 早上好 布莱斯小姐
- Well, I say...  - Good morning, Miss Bless.

452
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,543
看看黛西・梅
Look at Daisy Mae.

453
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,983
早啊
Morning.

454
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,145
你看上去真不错
You look just fine.

455
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:58,620
希望他喜欢
Hope he likes it.

456
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:05,653
呃...
Uh...

457
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:07,720
你能关下车窗吗?
Would you mind putting up the windows?

458
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,129
会吹乱头发的
It's gonna muss my hair.

459
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,595
你真假?
Are you serious?

460
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:16,833
我这一身汗 跟个怀孕的修女一样
I'm sweating like a pregnant nun back here.

461
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:20,433
难以置信!
Unbelievable!

462
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:38,185
嗨
Hi.

463
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,236
给你们15分钟
You got 15 minutes.

464
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,803
不准有任何肢体接触
No physical contact of any kind.

465
00:25:57,882 --> 00:25:59,713
不准录音
No tape recorders.

466
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,444
不准向犯人传送物品
No object may be passed to the prisoner.

467
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,816
我就在门外
I'll be right outside this door.

468
00:26:11,228 --> 00:26:13,389
范・维特先生
Mr. Van Wetter,

469
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:15,659
我叫沃德・詹森
my name is Ward Jansen.

470
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:20,363
- 这是我的搭档 亚德利・阿奇曼...  - 你看上去和照片里一样
- This is my associate, Yardley Acheman...  - You look like your picture.

471
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:25,340
嗯 是吗?
Mmm. I do?

472
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,377
谢谢
Thank you.

473
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,348
他们是你的报童?
These your paperboys?

474
00:26:34,184 --> 00:26:35,481
嗯啊
Mm-hm.

475
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,282
他们会为我们做什么呢?
What they gonna do for us?

476
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:41,589
他们是来救你的
They gonna save you.

477
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:43,718
他们来救我们?
They're gonna save us?

478
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,394
嗯啊
Mm-hm.

479
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:54,898
操 他们连自己都救不了
Shit. They can't even save themselves.

480
00:26:54,972 --> 00:26:56,633
范・维特先生 我们本想向你询问
Mr. Van Wetter, we wanted to ask you,

481
00:26:56,707 --> 00:26:58,197
你的案件中丢失的证据
about the lost evidence in your case.

482
00:26:58,275 --> 00:27:00,436
闭嘴 没看我忙着吗?
Shut up. Can't you see I'm busy?

483
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:08,009
你现在能为我做点什么吗?
Will you do something for me right now?

484
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:12,351
哦 哦 我也想
Oh. Oh, I wish I could.

485
00:27:17,895 --> 00:27:20,295
把你的大腿分开点
Spread your legs open a little bit.

486
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:26,400
嗯 好
Mmm. Yeah.

487
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,404
撕开你的连裤袜
Now tear off them pantyhose.

488
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:30,201
扯掉
Rip those off.

489
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:35,307
好 嗯
Yeah. Mm-hm.

490
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:37,279
移开你的手 嗯
Move your hands away. Mmm.

491
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:40,147
好
Yeah.

492
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:49,215
张开你的嘴...
Now open up your mouth...

493
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,318
想象下 你在信中和我写的那些
you picture what you wrote me in your letters.

494
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:33,533
你个贱货!
You bitch!

495
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:04,398
哦 我爱你
Oh, I love you.

496
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:14,102
这怎么回事?
What the hell's going on in here?

497
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:16,339
- 你是个好女孩  - 我警告过你们! 探监结束了!
- You're a good girl.  - I warned y'all! This visit's over!

498
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:17,933
我告诉你们探监... 走了!
I told y'all this visit was... Come on!

499
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:19,346
来啊 希拉里 不!
Come on, Hillary. No!

500
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,611
不! 什么也没发生!
No! There's nothing going on!

501
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:23,346
操! 不!
Shit! No!

502
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,912
他妈的怎么了? 我没动那女孩!
What the fuck? I didn't touch that girl!

503
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,787
不! 不!
No! No!

504
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,827
你们他妈笑什么?
What the fuck you laughing about?

505
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:36,859
走吧 布莱斯小姐
Come on now, Miss Bless.

506
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:39,300
那之后杰克回家吐了一场
Jack came home and threw up after that.

507
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,098
他不能相信在看到那一幕后
He couldn't believe he still loved her,

508
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,731
他依然爱着她 可他确实爱她
after what he saw, but he did.

509
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:47,038
- 你是老詹森是孩子?  - 嗯
- You're Ward Ward's boy?  - Mm-hm.

510
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,171
护城河县最奇怪的父子
Most contrary man in all of Moat County.

511
00:29:53,383 --> 00:29:55,442
今天我能为先生们做点什么呢?
What may I do for you gentlemen today?

512
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,181
关于卡尔警长的谋杀案
It's about the murder of Sheriff Call.

513
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,354
有些关于案件的
I understand that there's some physical evidence

514
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,557
重要证据丢失了?
relating to the case that was lost?

515
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,033
是 先生 我想是的
Yes, sir. I believe there was.

516
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,502
那我们想知道
Well, we was wondering what sort of explanation,

517
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,165
相关部门有什么解释呢
the department might have.

518
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,434
我不知道
I wish I knew.

519
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:16,144
范・维特先生曾切掉了副警长的大拇指
Mr. Van Wetter once cut a deputy's thumb off.

520
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,846
你们知道吗?
Did you know that?

521
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,012
我记得 那是因为一张罚单
It was over a traffic ticket, if I remember.

522
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,851
没有了拇指 有好多事你不能做
You can't do much without your thumb.

523
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:29,792
这是我们和灵长类动物的区别
It's what separates us from the primates.

524
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:33,957
就一件小事来说 你再也不能摸你老婆的乳头了
For a little thing like holding your wife's titty.

525
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,195
- 你没结婚吧 詹森先生?  - 没有
- You're not married, Mr. Jansen?  - No.

526
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,932
这样一件小事 你却不能做
A little thing like that, you can't do it.

527
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,968
或许我需要跟参与逮捕行动的
Maybe I'll just go talk to the deputies,

528
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,876
副警长谈谈
who was involved in the arrest.

529
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,710
你跟谁谈都行
You can talk to whoever you want,

530
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,148
只要他们都愿意和你谈 但没人愿意
as long as they'll talk to you. But they won't.

531
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,448
为什么?
And why is that?

532
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,852
因为他们没有忘记希拉里 对他们中的一员做的事
They haven't forgotten what Hillary did to one of their own.

533
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,480
法官承认一项
The judge allowed testimony,

534
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,184
他从没见过证据成立
based on evidence that he never even saw.

535
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,159
比起希拉里 他更相信警察的话
He took the officer's word over Hillary's.

536
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,459
这也不能怪他 大家都这么觉得
I can't say I blame him. Nobody does.

537
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,536
你打到我的脸了
You got me in the face there.

538
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,545
你会问
So you've got to ask him.

539
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,678
从2:00到6:00他在哪?
Where was he between 2:00 and 6:00?

540
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,085
我会问他关于他写的东西
I'm gonna ask him about some things he wrote,

541
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,747
那些写给夏洛特的信
some letters to Charlotte.

542
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,394
终于来了
Here we go.

543
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,692
稍等
Hold.

544
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,794
早上好 范・维特先生
Good morning, Mr. Van Wetter.

545
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,068
你怎么没穿裙子?
Where's your dress?

546
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,239
你不喜欢我这样吗?
You don't like me like this?

547
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,875
一个叫... 沃德
You know a prisoner by the name of...

548
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,441
沃德的囚犯
Ward, Ward, Ward.

549
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,111
你认识一个叫
You know a prisoner by the name

550
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,621
- 鲍勃・瓦伦丁先生的囚犯?  - 范・维特先生?
- of Mr. Bobby Valentine?  - Mr. Van Wetter?

551
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,284
德马库斯・威廉姆斯先生 鲍勃・希顿先生呢?
Mr. Demarcus Williams, Mr. Bobby Hinton?

552
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,759
另一个叫吉米・爱德华的囚犯
Another prisoner by the name of Jimmy Edwards,

553
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,989
还有一个德马库斯
another one, Demarcus.

554
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,123
还有 名字是库特吧 我记不清他的姓了
I think his name is Curt. I forgot his last name.

555
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,360
无所谓了 你知道这些人的共同点吗?
Anyway, you know what they all have in common?

556
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,063
嘿 马丁・路德・金
Hey, Martin Luther King.

557
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,106
- 你知道这些人的共同点吗?  - 什么?
- You know what they all had in common?  - What?

558
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,698
他们都穿裤子
They all wear pants.

559
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,903
这里所有的男人都穿裤子!
Every goddamned man in here wears pants!

560
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,946
你穿成这样跟他们有什么区别?
How am I supposed to tell you apart from them?

561
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,709
- 别那么跟她说话!  - 坐下 杰克
- Don't talk to her like that!  - Sit down, Jack.

562
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,647
快坐下
Sit the fuck down.

563
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,912
范・维特先生 我们时间不多 知道吗?
Mr. Van Wetter, we don't have a lot of time, all right?

564
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,749
我们要进行下一步了
We got to move on.

565
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,312
无论如何你都会进行下一步的 是吧 沃德?
You're gonna move on one way or another, Ward?

566
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,551
沃德是老大!
Ward's in charge!

567
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,221
他会按照他的方式进行... 行不通也不罢休
He's gonna get his way... till he don't.

568
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,094
也许脸上那道疤就是这么来的
Maybe that's how he got his scars on the face.

569
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,071
你在给布莱斯小姐的信中提到
You mentioned in one of your letters to Miss Bless

570
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,629
- 案发的时候...  - 转过身来 贱人!
- that you was working...  - Turn around, bitch!

571
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,938
- 你正为...  - 对 对
- At Uncle Tyree...  - Yeah, yeah,

572
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,602
泰利叔叔工作
at the time of the murder.

573
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:01,667
- 什么样的工作?  - 修剪草坪
- What kind of work you doing?  - Lawn work.

574
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,373
修剪草坪
Lawn work.

575
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,279
下次要么穿裙子来
You wear a dress in here next time,

576
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,978
要么你就别来了! 贱人 看着我!
or you don't bother coming! Bitch, look at me!

577
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,814
别再带那个自认为是
And stop bringing that fucking nigger,

578
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,689
穆罕穆德・阿里的黑鬼来了!
think he Muhammad Ali with you!

579
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,284
范・维特先生 过来坐
Mr. Van Wetter, come have a seat.

580
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,523
还以为自己是卡修斯・克莱 黑鬼
Cassius Clay, nigger.

581
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,224
给我们5分钟 我们让她换裙子来
We can get a dress here in five minutes.

582
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,493
过来坐下吧?
Why don't you have a seat?

583
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,534
回去吧 小子!
Go home, boy!

584
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,340
真不能理解...
I don't know...

585
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,434
夏洛特 你从哪弄来的那条裤子?
Charlotte, where does one get pants like that from anyway?

586
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,480
我觉得我们这案子要输啊
Well, I think we got the case licked.

587
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,105
就跟该死的马戏团一样!
This is a fucking circus!

588
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,450
在这个小镇
In this town,

589
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,491
威尔顿・派恩帮卡尔警长连任
Weldon Pine helped get Sheriff Call re-elected.

590
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,651
这间屋子里剑拔弩张
Tension was brewing in the house.

591
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,855
杰克因为希拉里和夏洛特的事吃醋
Jack was getting jealous of Hillary and Charlotte.

592
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,598
他还因为沃德和亚德利的关系吃醋
And he was getting jealous of Ward and Yardley, too.

593
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:04,301
沃德是个不轻易与人亲近的人
Ward wasn't somebody who attached himself to just anybody.

594
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,775
你爸爸的女朋友 叫什么名字?
Your dad's girlfriend, what's her name?

595
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,677
杰克不明白 为什么他和亚德利那么要好
Jack couldn't understand why he was so attached to that Yardley.

596
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,079
不 你没有
No, you didn't.

597
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,845
你经历的
What is the hottest temperature,

598
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,317
最高温度是多少?
that you've ever been in?

599
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,853
125华氏度
125.

600
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,719
你呢?
How about you?

601
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,849
把手伸出来 手都会融化的
Just put your hand out and it burns off,

602
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,086
我在佛罗里达的时候 那里最热 你呢?
The hottest was when I lived in Florida. How about you?

603
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,755
没注意 我从不注意温度
It doesn't bother me. I never pay attention to it.

604
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,561
潮湿和寒冷就像一把刀 穿透你的身体
Cold and wet just goes fucking through you like a knife

605
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,626
但... 无所谓了
but... I don't know.

606
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,901
那范・维特先生呢? 他是清白的吗?
So how's Mr. Van Wetter today? He still innocent?

607
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,442
不知道 如果他是...
I don't know. If he is...

608
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,707
就算他是 也不一定能证明
he sure as hell didn't have no help proving it,

609
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,645
至少叫威尔顿・派恩的人证明他不是清白的
not from that Weldon Pine guy anyway.

610
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,275
能给我个叉子之类的吗?
Could I have a fork or something?

611
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,286
鸡腿用手吃就可以了
The chicken legs, you eat those with your hands.

612
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,083
那是你们家的习惯
Maybe at your house.

613
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,056
这是南方 亲爱的
This is the South, sugar.

614
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,525
你们知道我的想法
Anyway, you know how I feel about that.

615
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,722
- 你用手吃土豆泥吗?  - 你真要...?
- Do you eat your mashed potatoes with your hands?  - Do you really want to...?

616
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:03,528
- 你真要... ? 你真的... ?  - 给我双筷子 安妮塔
- Do you really want to...? Do you really want to...?  - Bring me some chopsticks, Anita.

617
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,035
你真的认为
Do you really want to take the shot...

618
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,572
一个清白的男人或女人
on putting to death a man or a woman,

619
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,735
会被判死刑吗? 我是不会
when maybe they're innocent? I mean, I don't.

620
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,371
我无法那样生活
I don't want to try to have to live with that.

621
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,281
- 另外...  - 你到底是要吃它还是要折磨它?
- On the other hand...  - Are you gonna eat that or torture it?

622
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,784
跟你说了 我不饿
Told you, I'm not hungry.

623
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,117
那是因为你有爱情
That's 'cause you're in love.

624
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,179
我还知道你还在伺机而动
I know who you're sniffing around, too.

625
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,986
安妮塔 别在饭桌上逗他
Anita, please don't tease him at the table.

626
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,924
另外 如果某人是有罪的
On the other hand, if somebody's guilty,

627
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,930
你要为他们年复一年的生活报销吗?
well, you want to pay their room and board 365?

628
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:34,919
当然
Absolutely. Ah!

629
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,161
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

630
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,070
无所谓啦 只是冰茶而已 不会留下污渍的
Anyway, it's just iced tea. It ain't even gonna stain.

631
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,671
你会想 杰克应该交过女朋友了
You'da thought Jack woulda had a girlfriend by now,

632
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,679
但他只是看床下的黄色杂志
but all he did was jerk off to the pictures

633
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:53,274
打飞机
in those nudie magazines that was under his bed.

634
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,048
现在 她是他日夜思念的人
Now she was all he could think of night and day.

635
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,282
他绝对是陷入爱河了
Oh, yeah, he was definitely in love.

636
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,718
他要她
He needed her.

637
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,126
你看什么呢? 给我拿来
What you reading? You give it to me.

638
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,325
这是什么破玩意 "洛丽塔"
What is this shit? "Lolita."

639
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,334
色情的 肯定是
Porno, I bet.

640
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,175
你需要个女朋友
You need a girlfriend.

641
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,877
看看那群女孩
Look at them girls over there.

642
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,183
去认识一下 去吧
Go on and introduce yourself. Go on.

643
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,785
我在这就好
I'm just fine right here.

644
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,962
你想让我给你吹箫 是不?
You want me to blow you, don't you?

645
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,468
你不用回答 我知道的
You don't have to answer. I know it's true.

646
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,735
我不会因为一时痛快...
I'm not gonna blow a friendship...

647
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,175
而失去一个朋友
over a stupid little blowjob.

648
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,170
听懂了吗?
You hear me?

649
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,512
为什么和我说这些?
Look, why you talking to me like that?

650
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,545
看见那个穿蓝色泳衣的女孩没? 她会给你吹箫的
See that one in blue? She'll blow you.

651
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,750
我不想让她给我吹
I don't want someone like that blowing me.

652
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,055
你没进监狱真是个好事
It's a good thing you're not in prison,

653
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,924
因为在那你没的选
because you wouldn't have a choice there.

654
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,663
去你的
Fuck you.

655
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,105
杰克 回来嘛
Jack, come back here.

656
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,859
天啊 帕姆
Oh my God. Pam.

657
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,931
那是什么? 他还好吗?
What is that? Is he okay?

658
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,494
他是不是过敏了?
Is he having an allergic reaction?

659
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,540
被水母蜇了吧?
A jellyfish sting or something?

660
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,247
肯定是该死的水母
A fucking jellyfish did that.

661
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,210
应该对着水母蜇的伤口尿尿
You're supposed to piss on a jellyfish sting.

662
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,212
这也太尴尬了
We're gonna have to do something embarrassing.

663
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,180
- 你只能挺住了  - 嘿!
- You got to hang in there.  - Hey!

664
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,045
- 你要...  - 你要在他身上尿尿?
- Well, you're gonna...  - You'll piss on him?

665
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,709
你们要干什么?
What are you doing to him?

666
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,377
叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

667
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,183
- 他有过敏反应!  - 闭嘴吧你!
- He's having a reaction!  - Shut the fuck up!

668
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,950
- 别推我!  - 你应该尿...
- Don't push me!  - You're supposed to piss...

669
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,617
滚远点! 我能看见
Get the fuck out of here! I can see this.

670
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,320
我看出他中毒了 你不能尿...
I can see he's poisoned. You don't pee on...

671
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,590
- 别推我!  - 我扇你了啊
- Don't push me!  - I will slap your face.

672
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,723
- 滚一边去  - 好吧
- Get the fuck out of here.  - All right.

我会跟你算账的! 我要报警
I said, I will kick your ass! I'm going to call the police.

674
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,032
- 滚!  - 好吧
- Move it!  - Fine.

675
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,971
就算有人要对他尿尿 那个人也得是我!
If anyone's gonna piss on him, it's gonna be me!

676
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,564
去死吧你!
Fine, fuck you!

00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,438
他不喜欢陌生人在他身上尿尿!
He don't like strangers peeing on him!

678
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,909

00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,367
你不会有事的!
You're gonna be okay!

684
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,210
杰克啊
Jack.

685
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,683
你干嘛呢?
What are you doing here?

686
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,220
你觉得呢?
What do you think I'm doing here?

687
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,218
跟你说了进门之前
Told you to knock on my door

688
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,331
先敲门嘛
before you come in my room.

689
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,792
别说话
Oh, hush up.

690
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,022
我给你带了些东西
Here, I brought you something.

691
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,530
把药吃了
Take these pills.

692
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,760
我真难闻
I smell awful.

693
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,564
那是因为那个金发妞尿了你一脸
That's because that blond lady peed all over your face.

694
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,205
来 喝了它
Ugh. Here, drink this.

695
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,641
还疼吗?
Does it hurt?

696
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,575
我冷 我冷 冷
I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm cold.

杰克 我并不知道
Jack, I had no idea.

705
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,814
我不知道你爸爸
I had no idea that your own father,

706
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,283
会把那样的事登上报纸
would print something like that.

我爸想把我怎么样?
What's Dad trying to do to me?

711
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,201
这叫新闻效益 杰克
It's called the newspaper business, Jack.

712
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,302
真是的
Oh, shit.

713
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,808
放开他 杰克! 你会弄死他的
Let him go, Jack! You're gonna kill him.

714
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,515

你再碰我一下
You put your hands on me again,

死去吧 黑鬼!
Fuck you, nigger!

他需要女人
He needs to get laid.

719
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,943
他需要一个狗链子
He needs a fucking straitjacket.

720
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,606
他性生活抑郁
He's sexually repressed.

721
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,445
40岁的女人才性抑郁呢
Sexually repressed is a 40-year-old woman,

722
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,419
监狱里的男人都能让她们兴奋!
who's obsessed with prison cock!

723
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,352
- 真难听  - 冷静点
- That's not nice.  - Calm down now.

724
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,083
去你的冷静!
No, fuck calm down!

725
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,352
我才不会让一个毛头小子叫我黑鬼
I'm not having some kid call me a nigger.

726
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,507
我现在就要他滚蛋!
I want him out of here now!

727
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,888
亚德利啊?
Yardley?

728
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:57,537
杰克 我们去监狱
Jack, let's go to the prison.

729
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,371
你们俩继续在这吵吧
You two can stay here and keep arguing.

730
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,206
这回我自己跟希拉里谈
This time I'm talking to Hillary by myself.

731
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,768
走吧
Come on.

732
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,507
他都不会看你一眼的
He's not even gonna look at you

733
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,573
除非我穿着漂亮的裙子去
if I'm not there in a pretty dress.

734
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,618
那他太可悲了
Well, that's too bad for him.

735
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,210
嘿沃德
Ward.

736
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,751
我们走着瞧
You'll see.

737
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,296
我知道杰克不是故意的
I knew Jack didn't mean to say it.

738
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,463
但那时候我们住在一起
But those were the times we were living in,

739
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,063
发生了就是发生了
and it was what it was.

740
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,804
亚德利这边呢 就...
Yardley, on the other hand, well...

741
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,511
法医报告上说警长
Forensic report says that the sheriff,

742
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,078
在凌晨2点到3点间被刺杀
was stabbed between 2 and 3 AM.

743
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,919
恩 就像我跟你说的
Yep. Like I told you,

744
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,186
当时我跟我的泰里叔叔在奥蒙德海滩
I was with... my Uncle Tyree doing lawn work,

745
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,852
修剪草坪
in Ormond Beach at the time.

746
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,123
- 修剪草坪?  - 对
- Lawn work?  - Yes, sir.

747
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,028
- 是指偷窃吗?  - 是
- You mean stealing?  - Yes, sir.

748
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,090
从高尔夫场地偷草皮
Stealing sod off a golf course.

749
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,296
一个开发商出钱要的
A developer paid through the teeth for that shit.

750
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,811
我们卖了草皮 我们直到日出前
We sold it and we didn't make it back,

751
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,568
才赶到河流那
to the river till sunrise.

752
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,541
- 什么样的开发商?  - 公寓楼的
- What kind of developers?  - Condominiums, man.

753
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,703
- 有名字吗?  - 没有
- You got a name?  - No, I don't.

754
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,805
副警长们说 他们在凌晨6点发现警长的尸体
Deputies say they found the sheriff's body at 6 AM...

755
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,941
但是他被杀的方式
but it was the way he was killed.

756
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,045
让所有人认为是你干的
That's what makes everybody assume it was you.

757
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:55,057
- 你怎么想?  - 你说呢
- What you think?  - You tell me.

758
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,719
我不是这里唯一一个身藏砍刀的人
I ain't the only one carrying a machete around here.

759
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:01,531
没错
True.

760
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,796
副警长们去了泰里的住处
The deputies went to Tyree's house,

761
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,927
他说他一晚上都在睡觉
he said he'd been sleeping in bed all night,

762
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:10,565
还有一家子人为他作证
and had a whole bunch of family members there to confirm it.

763
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:13,592
之后他们去了你的房子...
Then they go to your house...

764
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,195
找到了沾血的衬衫和刀
where they find the bloodstained shirt and knife.

765
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:18,638
是的 好吧 听我说
Yeah, all right. Listen to me.

766
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:21,802
我所有的刀和衬衫都沾了血
Every knife and shirt that I own is stained in blood.

767
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:23,402
这是我的谋生之道
It's what I do for a living.

768
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:25,811
我剥鳄鱼的皮
I'm gutting alligators for their skin.

769
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:27,645
行吗? 我是个单身汉
Okay? I was a bachelor.

770
00:45:27,717 --> 00:45:30,743
没有人帮我洗衣服
I didn't have nobody to do my laundry.

771
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,720
大概有人帮你洗衣服
You probably got somebody to do your laundry.

772
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:33,813
你觉得呢?
What you think?

773
00:45:35,124 --> 00:45:36,489
我确信你有
I bet you do.

774
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:42,062
鳄鱼的血绝不可能和警长匹配的 对吧?
They never matched the blood to the sheriff's, did they?

775
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:43,860
告诉我如何找到泰利
Tell me how to find Tyree.

776
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:52,665
仁慈的怀抱是如此的宽广
The arms of mercy are so wide,

777
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:55,404
他们会接受任何人
they will accept any man,

778
00:45:55,478 --> 00:45:59,312
但他们不会接受穿裤子的人
but they will not accept any man wearing pants.

779
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,681
我的女人在哪儿?
Where is my woman?

780
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:07,188
我的女人在哪儿?
Where's my woman?

781
00:46:07,256 --> 00:46:10,851
现在你唯一需要对话的人就是我 孩子
The only one you need to talk to right now is me, baby.

782
00:46:10,927 --> 00:46:12,360
我唯一需要对话的人?
The only one I need to talk to?

783
00:46:12,428 --> 00:46:13,986
我是唯一一个 我就是你的仁慈
I'm the only one. I'm your mercy.

784
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,088
我是你宽大的臂膀 我是你肚子里的蛔虫
I'm your arms wide open, I'm your pants.

785
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:20,325
沃德说了算!
Ward's in charge!

786
00:46:24,774 --> 00:46:27,072
如果你想见泰利 我告诉你他在哪儿
If you wanna go see Tyree, I'll give you directions,

787
00:46:27,143 --> 00:46:30,601
但你必须做出选择 因为他是个暴力的男人
but you got to make that choice because he's a violent man.

788
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,375
现在和我待在一起
Now stay with me now,

789
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:34,348
问题开始变得棘手了
because this is when it gets tricky.

790
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,612
沃德叫了夏洛特
Ward called Charlotte,

791
00:46:36,686 --> 00:46:41,521
告诉她带亚德利到奥蒙德沙滩
and told her to drive Yardley to Ormond Beach.

792
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:45,789
他想核实希拉里所谓的高尔夫球场的故事
He wanted to verify Hillary's so-called golf course story.

793
00:46:45,862 --> 00:46:48,888
男孩们继续拜访这个泰利叔叔
The boys went on to visit this Uncle Tyree.

794
00:46:48,965 --> 00:46:51,559
兄弟 这太愚蠢了 我们要去哪儿?
Man, this is stupid. Where are we going?

795
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:53,829
没人住在这外面 没人能住在这外面
No one lives out here. No one could live out here.

796
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:58,465
你和安妮塔说了你的... 用词?
You talk to Anita about your... choice of words?

797
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:02,305
这事弄得一团糟
It was fucked up.

798
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,804
我知道
I know.

799
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:18,759
该死的
Goddamn it.

800
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:20,261
你确定不用我去看车?
Sure you don't me to watch the car?

801
00:47:22,098 --> 00:47:25,499
该死的! 这东西不管用 伙计
Goddamn it! This stuff ain't working, man.

802
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:27,502
就像他们喜欢这废物一样
It's like they like this shit.

803
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,003
比水母好多了 我打赌
Better than jellyfish, I bet.

804
00:47:30,907 --> 00:47:32,807
他妈的! 哦 老天!
Fuck! Oh, my God!

805
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,900
小心! 你离它太近了 沃德! 沃德!
Watch it! You're way too close to him. Ward! Ward!

806
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,878
你最好跳过它
You better jump him.

807
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:40,006
在这好多了 我们不得不蹲低
It's better in here where we have to get lower.

808
00:47:44,187 --> 00:47:46,451
沃德 你陷进去了!
Ward, you're sinking!

809
00:47:46,522 --> 00:47:48,149
这地方就是飘着的
This whole place is just floating.

810
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,359
你曾想过妈妈吗?
You ever think about Mama?

811
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:08,542
我在想她在哪儿
I wonder where she at.

812
00:48:13,382 --> 00:48:15,612
她在亚利桑那州的图森
She is in Tucson, Arizona.

813
00:48:21,991 --> 00:48:23,151
你交了个女朋友?
You got a girlfriend?

814
00:48:30,132 --> 00:48:31,156
为什么?
Why?

815
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:43,577
你不记得了 但是妈妈过去常唠叨说 呃...
You don't remember this, but Mom used to go on about, uh...

816
00:48:43,646 --> 00:48:47,082
等你结婚的时候再跟女人亲热 对吧? 嗯...
don't make love to a woman until you get married, right? Mm... hm.

817
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,915
我一直这样做直到我...
I followed that until I was...

818
00:48:56,859 --> 00:48:58,588

819
00:48:58,661 --> 00:48:59,753
我们走
Let's go.

820
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,172
范・维特尔先生?

821
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:17,179
下午好 先生
Good afternoon, sir.

822
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,510
我叫沃德・詹森 我为"迈阿密时报"工作
My name is Ward Jansen. I work for "The Miami Times."

823
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,176
我们代表你的侄子希拉里来这儿
We're here on behalf here of your nephew, Hillary.

824
00:49:24,387 --> 00:49:26,412
你丢了一只鞋
You lost a shoe.

825
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:31,383
你很幸运只遇见了一条蛇
You're lucky it was just the one.

826
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,224
这到处都是蛇
Snakes all around here.

827
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:37,289
范・维特尔先生 我们需要和你谈谈你的侄子
We need to talk to you about your nephew, Mr. Van Wetter.

828
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:41,026
有点晚了 不是吗?
Little late for that, isn't it?

829
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,298
他将要被处以死刑
He gonna be strapped to a chair and electrocuted.

830
00:49:43,372 --> 00:49:45,203
呃...
Well...

831
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,970
你来这儿就是告诉我这个?
you come all the way up here just to tell me that?

832
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:49,705
你本可以不来的
You could've saved yourself a trip.

833
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,213
他告诉我卡尔警长被杀那天
He tells me that he was with you,

834
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,249
他和你在一起
the night Sheriff Call was murdered,

835
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,148
在偷草皮 之后你们就卖了
stealing sod, which you later sold.

836
00:49:57,954 --> 00:50:00,718
没人相信他吧
Let's hope nobody believes him.

837
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,816
偷窃是违法的 不是吗?
Stealing's against the law, ain't it?

838
00:50:03,893 --> 00:50:05,656
现在他还有时间
Now he's still got time.

839
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,464
我不太喜欢你
I don't much care for you.

840
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:14,867
来我的家...
Come up here in my home...

841
00:50:14,937 --> 00:50:16,996
叫我小偷
and call me a thief.

842
00:50:19,108 --> 00:50:23,670
我来这儿不是为了偷窃一事的 范・维特尔先生
I ain't up here about thieving, Mr. Van Wetter.

843
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:28,410
我来这儿是关乎一个人的生命能否继续下去...
I'm up here about whether a man's life needs to be taken or not...

844
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,349
因为谋杀卡尔警长一事
for the murder of Sheriff Call.

845
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,587
但如果那晚你和你的侄子在一起
But if you was with your nephew that night,

846
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,857
你承认的话 这对希拉里是生死攸关的
it's vital for Hillary that you admit it.

847
00:50:43,366 --> 00:50:45,357
我觉得他不太喜欢你
I don't think he likes you much.

848
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:46,867
我也不太喜欢他
I don't like him much either.

849
00:50:53,943 --> 00:50:55,274
冰激凌在哪儿?
Where's the ice cream?

850
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:56,801
来了
It's coming.

851
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,369
让那个婴儿安静点
Keep that baby quiet.

852
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:02,814
那个婴儿到底怎么了?
What's wrong with that baby?

853
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:06,355
好吧 嗯 坐下来
All right, well, sit on it.

854
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:13,893
是的
Yeah.

855
00:51:19,335 --> 00:51:20,632
你想...?
You want...?

856
00:51:22,238 --> 00:51:23,671
你想来点冰激凌吗?
You want a little ice cream?

857
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:29,010
你不想吃冰激凌
You don't want to have any ice cream.

858
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:31,309
你带着这椅子跟我来
You take this chair out here with me.

859
00:51:34,984 --> 00:51:36,884
没道理你呆在那里
No sense you staying over there.

860
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,081
谢谢
Thank you.

861
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:42,147
小伙计 自己拿把椅子

自己拿把椅子
Get yourself a chair.

863
00:51:47,863 --> 00:51:49,160

864
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,721

高尔夫俱乐部
Golf club.

869
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,376
奥蒙德海滩
Ormond Beach.

870
00:52:08,017 --> 00:52:10,611
偷草皮 再卖...
Stole sod, sold it...

871
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,885
卖给一个公寓开发商
to this one condo developer.

872
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:17,086
希拉里住在这里的哪儿?
Where's Hillary live from here?

873
00:52:17,126 --> 00:52:19,390
我们直到早上日出才回来
We didn't get back till the morning, sunrise.

874
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,663
他住在那边
He lives that way.

875
00:52:23,732 --> 00:52:25,563
那么你为什么现在告诉我?
So why are you telling me now?

876
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:31,531
你看起来像是唯一一个相信希拉里是无辜的人
You seem like the only person thinks Hillary's innocent.

877
00:52:33,476 --> 00:52:36,809
不 先生 范・维特尔先生 不是的
No, sir, Mr. Van Wetter. No, sir.

878
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:38,141
我没那么说过
I didn't say that.

879
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:41,607

Your boy...

880
00:52:43,352 --> 00:52:45,013
他在那边紧张不安
he's getting nervous over there.

881
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:46,952
我们走 我已经和你说完话了

882
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:51,022
- 你藏了什么?  - 沃德?
- What you hiding?  - Ward?

883
00:52:51,093 --> 00:52:52,390
我对你的问题...
I'm sick...

884
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,292
感到厌恶
of your questions.

885
00:52:56,832 --> 00:52:58,094
嘿尤金?

我们在监狱停了下来

- 泰利?  - 是的

我不清楚
I don't know.

892
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,423

00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:23,788
他们不像看上去那么闷
They ain't as dumb as they look.

898
00:53:46,215 --> 00:53:47,739
天啊!
Jesus!

依旧在亚德利的房间
In Yardley's room, no less.

900
00:53:49,285 --> 00:53:50,445
该死 伙计 看看你
Fuck, man. Look at you.

901
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:56,949
你对这起案件着了迷
You're becoming obsessed with this case.

902

唤醒我吧

你看起来很糟糕 沃德
You look terrible, Ward.

906
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:09,171
那些蚊子把你当早餐?

亚德利找到了高尔夫球场
Yardley found the golf course.

- You found the golf course?  - What's he doing in my clothes?

909
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:18,078
车坏了
The car broke down.

910
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:19,808
我们不得不走到市里
We had to walk into town,

911
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:23,147
找个汽车旅馆梳洗一番
stopped by the motel to freshen up.

912
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,653
现在脱下我的衣服
Get out of my clothes now.

913
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,259
好了
Come on.

914
00:54:32,328 --> 00:54:33,818
好了 杰克
Come on, Jack.

915
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,831
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

916
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,662
布莱斯小姐 快点 别管了
Miss Bless. Come on, stop it.

917
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,894
嘿杰克!
Jack!

918
00:54:42,671 --> 00:54:44,571
谋杀的那个早上
On the morning of the murder,

919
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,835
奥蒙德海滩高尔夫球场的草地负责人
the grounds superintendent of the Ormond Beach Golf Course,

920
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,342
给警察局打电话
phoned the Police Department,

921
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,843
说他的四块草地
to report that four of his greens,

922
00:54:49,878 --> 00:54:51,505
都在夜里被人偷走了
had been stripped in the night.

923
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,275
- 你和那个负责人谈话了?  - 没
- You talked to the superintendent?  - No.

924
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:55,283
他死了 不过我找到了另一个人
He died, but I found another guy who remembered,

925
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:57,785
记得俱乐部给官员打电话
that the club called the governor,

926
00:54:57,853 --> 00:54:59,787
请他宣布那儿是个杂乱无章的地方
to ask him to declare them a disaster area,

927
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:01,686
这样他们就能得到联邦资金
so they could get federal funds,

928
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:02,849
来更换草坪了
to replace the greens.

929
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,552
进展的更好了
It gets better.

930
00:55:04,627 --> 00:55:06,288
我也找到了建造者
I found the builder, too,

931
00:55:06,362 --> 00:55:07,886
买了被偷草皮的那个人
the guy who bought the stolen greens.

932
00:55:07,963 --> 00:55:10,022
他记得希拉里和泰利
He remembered Hillary and Tyree.

933
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,363
他们早上六点开卡车露的面
They showed up at 6 AM in a truck.

934
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,561
他看了一眼他们和东西
He took one look at them and what they had,

935
00:55:14,637 --> 00:55:18,801
认为他们是从墓地偷来的
and thought they'd stolen it from a cemetery.

936
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:21,604
但是当然 无论如何他都不想被牵连进来
But of course, he doesn't want to be connected to this in any way.

937
00:55:22,645 --> 00:55:24,237
他是谁?
And who was he?

938
00:55:24,313 --> 00:55:26,042
嗯 唯一让他和我说话的方法
Well, the only way he'd talk to me,

939
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,639
就是我承诺不说他的名字
is if I promised to keep him anonymous.

940
00:55:27,716 --> 00:55:29,377
快点吧 他叫什么?
Come on now. What's his name?

941
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,248
不 不 不
No, no, no.

942
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,280
我要保密 我给他承诺了
I've got to keep it anonymous. I gave him my word.

943
00:55:33,322 --> 00:55:35,051
他有 呃 他有背景
He's got, well, he's in a position,

945
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:40,989
但是很好 嗯?
But good, huh?

946
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:42,496
很出色
Outstanding.

947
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:47,599
你怎么找到他的?
How'd you find him?

你和亚德利上床了吗?

952
00:56:05,854 --> 00:56:08,186
你懂得 像亚德利这种人 你就是...

953
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:14,288
想让他在你身边

954

你知道我什么意思吗?
You know what I mean?

955
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:19,529
你因为那样和他上床?
You fucked him for that?

956
00:56:23,372 --> 00:56:27,035
上床是这个世界上最自然的事了 杰克
Fucking a man is the most natural thing in the world, Jack.

957
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:28,371
是这样的

958
00:56:30,379 --> 00:56:31,368
是这样的

959

我有点喜欢这儿了

这是个好想法

961
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:50,558
哦!

962
00:56:50,632 --> 00:56:52,793

967
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,587
哇! 跳得不错!
Woo! You're good!

968
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:30,100
我不是在道歉 明白吗?
This is not me apologizing, you dig?

969
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:32,333
我只是不喜欢看你难过
I just don't like to see you sad.

970
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,783
亚德利把奥蒙德海滩发现的新线索
Yardley told their editor about the new evidence,

971
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:50,222
告诉了他们的编辑
from Ormond Beach.

972
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:53,386
这在法律制度中体现公平已经足够了
This was enough to show injustice in the legal system of Lately,

973
00:57:53,462 --> 00:57:55,396
对一个完美的故事来说也足够了
and enough for a good story.

974
00:57:55,464 --> 00:57:57,898
亚德利想离开小镇
Yardley wanted to get out of town,

975
00:57:57,966 --> 00:57:59,456

地板上的这些花生
All these peanuts on the floor.

厌烦了这活儿
Sick of this shit.

979
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,218
我找不到妈妈的戒指
I can't find Mama's ring.

980
00:58:22,257 --> 00:58:23,986
哦 一定是个黑鬼半夜
Oh, well, a nigger must have come,

981
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:26,118
溜进来偷了它
in the middle of the night and stole it.

982
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:36,702
我很抱歉 安妮塔
I'm sorry, Anita.

983

You know, Jackie, you got to watch your mouth.

987
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:52,977
有人会切掉你的屁股 扔在狗屎里
Somebody'll cut your little ass over some shit like that.

988
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:57,849

有时会
Sometimes.

00:59:10,038 --> 00:59:12,768
她离开你的方式真不仁慈
It's a dis-damn grace the way she left you.

993
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:19,108

是什么让这个故事不一样?

What makes your story different than the others, John?

What makes this case so different that you want to pull the plug now?

事实 还有什么可做的?
The facts. What's left to do?

1005
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,992
你已经来这儿一个半月了
You've been up there a month and a half.

1006
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,660
我想让你接着干

为了别人救救那废物

我要去奥蒙德海滩找真相
I'm going to Ormond Beach to get the facts.

广告商? 你想让我为了你的报纸

1014
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:37,216
考虑一下广告商?
with the advertisers for your newspaper?

1015
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:38,691
沃德 你什么都不知道
Ward, you don't know everything.

1016
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,193
他心里有数 爸爸

闭嘴! 我没和你说话

他知道怎么编故事

1019
01:00:44,032 --> 01:00:46,057
只是他还不能领会
but what he doesn't fully appreciate,

1020
01:00:46,134 --> 01:00:49,069
故事会流传到一个社区里
is that the stories go out into a community.

1021
01:00:49,137 --> 01:00:50,365
他们会共鸣
They resonate.

1022
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:52,134

1050
01:02:26,468 --> 01:02:28,561
沃德一直不信亚德利说的话

1051

1053

我去了理发店

打扮要花很多时间的
Takes a lot to look like this.

1062
01:03:13,115 --> 01:03:16,778
夏洛特・布莱斯 你真颓废

渴了?
Thirsty, huh?

1066
01:03:28,463 --> 01:03:29,623

Jack, would you tell your brother to get his hands off of me?

布莱斯小姐什么都不知道 哈?
Miss Bless ain't got no answer, huh?

1075
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:57,049
不可能
I didn't think so.

1076
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:02,926
你哥哥很奇怪
Your brother's acting strange.

1077
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:05,330
他不常喝成这样
Not used to drinking like this.

1078
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:11,595
这还不止
A little more than that.

1079
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:20,812
沃德为什么要这么做?
Why is Ward doing this?

1080

我们明天还要去很多地方呢

01:04:43,104 --> 01:04:45,834
从来没有人给我这样的东西
No one's ever given me something like this before.

1085
01:04:52,113 --> 01:04:55,173
如果你想要回去就告诉我 啊?
Well, you just tell me when you want it back, huh?

1086
01:04:56,785 --> 01:04:58,685
真美
It's beautiful.

1087
01:05:15,503 --> 01:05:19,337
杰克 你想和我上床?
You want me to fuck you, Jack?

1088
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:23,173
那我就让你玩个痛快
Then I'm gonna fuck you any way you want.

1089
01:05:26,581 --> 01:05:28,515
杰克
Jack.

1090
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:32,411
杰克!
Jack!

1091
01:05:32,487 --> 01:05:36,685
我想要双鳄鱼皮鞋
I want to get some alligator shoes.

1092
01:05:36,758 --> 01:05:38,851
啊 杰克
Mmm, Jack.

1093
01:05:38,927 --> 01:05:41,657
你打算就任一个女人摆布
You wanted your ass whupped.

1094
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,197
你是不是就想这样?
Is that what you wanted?

1095
01:05:43,265 --> 01:05:44,823
告诉我你想要什么
Tell me what you want.

1096
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,458
你就是头下流的野猪
You're a dirty pig.

1097
01:05:46,534 --> 01:05:48,695
我要让你玩个痛快
I'll fuck you any way you want.

1098
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:51,170
不大点的白种猪
Little white pig.

1099
01:05:52,841 --> 01:05:57,278
杰克? 杰克! 杰克!
Jack? Jack! Jack!

1100
01:05:57,345 --> 01:05:58,369
杰克 醒醒!
Jack, wake up!

1101
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:01,744
沃德的房间出事了
Something's going on in Ward's room.

1102
01:06:27,876 --> 01:06:29,605
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

1103
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:31,407
住手!
Stop it!

1104
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:32,673
你他妈搞什么?
What the fuck?

1105
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:38,646
救命! 快来救人啊!
Help! We need help!

1106
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,021
钥匙他妈的在哪?
Where's the fucking keys?

1107
01:07:17,092 --> 01:07:19,287
钥匙究竟他妈的在哪?
Where's the fucking keys, you piece of shit?

1108
01:07:19,361 --> 01:07:21,295
他妈的 醒醒!
Motherfucker, wake up!

1109
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:25,029
救命啊!
Help!

1110
01:07:27,602 --> 01:07:29,695
钥匙他妈的在哪?
Where are the fucking keys?

1111
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:31,500
沃德 这塑料东西是干嘛的?
Ward, what's the plastic for?

1112
01:07:33,808 --> 01:07:35,366
怎么... 怎么会有塑料?
What the... what is the plastic?

1113
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:43,282
没事了 究竟在搞什么?
It's Okay. What the fuck?

1114
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,002
我观察了你很多次
I've watched you so often.

1115
01:08:05,073 --> 01:08:08,065
你就坐在这 我听说你会敲鼓
You sit here, and I heard that you play a little drum.

1116
01:08:08,143 --> 01:08:10,976
- 你都不站起来做点什么  - 没错
- You didn't get up and do anything.  - No.

1117
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,707
我听说你唱歌不好听
I heard you couldn't sing,

1118
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:14,339
不过跟我在一起你必须要唱
but with me you are going to sing.

1119
01:08:18,987 --> 01:08:20,579
他会好起来的
He's gonna be fine.

1120
01:08:59,727 --> 01:09:02,252
你不用睡床尾椅
You don't have to sleep all the way down there.

1121
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,885
好吧
All right.

1122
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,656
就这一次
Just this once.

1123
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:45,295
电视开着我没办法做
I can't fuck with this TV on.

1124
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,911
你看着我说话
Feels kind of awkward to be talking

1125
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,446
感觉有点尴尬
while you see this.

1126
01:09:58,686 --> 01:10:02,452
不过他们做这个本来就会很尴尬
But it's kind of awkward that they're doing it in the first place.

1127
01:10:08,363 --> 01:10:10,593
和杰克同龄的大多数男孩
Most boys Jack's age fall in love,

1128
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,929
都会和高中或大学时代的意中人相恋
with their high school or college sweetheart,

1129
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,629
但杰克在他妈妈离开后
but Jack never bothered much with girls,

1130
01:10:15,703 --> 01:10:16,931
没花过多少心思在女孩身上
after his mama left.

1131
01:10:21,876 --> 01:10:24,709
我想你可以说他有被抛弃的情结
I guess you could say he had abandonment issues.

1132
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:27,873
有了夏洛特 就像是有了一个集母亲
With Charlotte, it was like he was getting his mama,

1133
01:10:27,949 --> 01:10:31,476
高中情人 和性欲过剩的芭比娃娃
his high school sweetheart, and a oversexed Barbie doll,

1134
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:33,384
于一身的合体
all rolled into one.

1135
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,986
不管怎样 我猜你们都看得够多了
Any who, I think y'all seen enough.

1136
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:48,068
我的头发乱死了 别看我
My hair looks like crap. Don't even look at it.

1137
01:10:48,136 --> 01:10:49,831
哦 糟糕
Oh, shit.

1138
01:10:49,904 --> 01:10:52,338
我要去趟理发店
I got to go to the hairdresser.

1139
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:55,240
头发卷的不对劲
My wig ain't acting right.

1140
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,709
我真不明白你他妈
I don't understand what the fuck,

1141
01:10:56,778 --> 01:10:58,405
干嘛要和希拉里在一起
you're doing with Hillary.

1142
01:11:02,016 --> 01:11:02,914
哦
Oh.

1143
01:11:04,852 --> 01:11:06,513
开始了
Here we go.

1144
01:11:06,588 --> 01:11:08,146
你不爱他
You don't love him.

1145
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:11,351
- 真的?  - 嗯
- Really?  - Mm-hm.

1146
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:12,757
你怎么知道
You don't know that.

1147
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:17,122
你什么都不懂
You don't know anything.

1148
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:19,359
- 你才20  - 你也没大我多少
- You're 20 years old.  - You're not that much older.

1149
01:11:20,702 --> 01:11:22,363
我大你太多了
I'm a lot older.

1150
01:11:23,938 --> 01:11:25,929
我们不可能的
It ain't gonna happen.

1151
01:11:26,007 --> 01:11:27,167
看着我
Look at me.

1152
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:28,766
我们不现实
It's not practical.

1153
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:31,175
我比谋杀犯还不现实?
I'm not as practical as the murderer?

1154
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,373
他是无辜的 杰克 这才是重点
He's not guilty, Jack. That's the point.

1155
01:11:33,448 --> 01:11:35,678
- 这不是重点  - 妈的 我就知道你会这样
- That's not the point.  - Fuck this. I knew it would happen.

1156
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,183
怎么了?
What?

1157
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:38,879
给你点春光你就...
I give you some ass and suddenly...

1158
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:44,884
听我说... 希拉里没那么坏
Look... Hillary ain't so bad.

1159
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:47,223
我也没那么好
And I'm not so good.

1160
01:11:47,295 --> 01:11:49,786
我有另一面
I've got another side.

1161
01:11:49,864 --> 01:11:51,593
我有阴暗的一面
I got a fucked-up side,

1162
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:53,634
我的男人不会介意
and it gets along just fine with my man.

1163
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:55,566
你不能把自己分成两面
You can't split yourself into sides.

1164
01:11:55,637 --> 01:11:57,502
当然可以 不信问问你哥
Sure, you can. Just ask your brother.

1165
01:11:57,572 --> 01:11:59,733
这和沃德有他妈什么关系?
What the fuck does Ward have to do with this?

1166
01:11:59,807 --> 01:12:01,847
他也有阴暗的一面 不是因为他是个娈童
He has a dark side and I don't mean him being a fag.

1167
01:12:01,876 --> 01:12:05,744
现在这些男人只能互相支持
Now these boys lived for each other.

1168
01:12:05,813 --> 01:12:10,045
让杰克伤心的并不是因为沃德是同性恋
Jack wasn't hurt by Ward being a homosexual,

1169
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:12,985
或者是他阴暗的嗜好
or the dark stuff that he was into.

1170
01:12:13,054 --> 01:12:16,421
是因为沃德从没告诉过他
He was just hurt that Ward never told him.

1171
01:12:21,562 --> 01:12:23,655
- 嗨  - 嘿 你好
- Hi.  - Hey, there.

1172
01:12:25,733 --> 01:12:28,133
- 他好多了 很快就没事了  - 很好
- He's doing better. He's gonna be all right.  - Good.

1173
01:12:29,504 --> 01:12:30,835
呃 我要走了
So, I gotta go.

1174
01:12:32,607 --> 01:12:34,165
走? 你要去哪?
Go where? Where you going?

1175
01:12:35,343 --> 01:12:36,901
我要回家
I'm going back home.

1176
01:12:39,514 --> 01:12:41,106
你哪也不用去
You don't have to go anywhere.

1177
01:12:41,182 --> 01:12:43,946
已经到了这一步了
It's just the way it works.

1178
01:12:44,018 --> 01:12:45,918
你犯不着去你不想去的地方
You shouldn't go anywhere you don't want to go.

1179
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:53,020
谁说我不想去?
Who says I don't want to go?

1180
01:12:54,629 --> 01:12:55,857
那你干嘛一定要走?
Why do you have to go?

1181
01:12:57,865 --> 01:12:59,093
因为我必须走
'Cause I do.

1182
01:13:00,535 --> 01:13:02,162
把戒指拿回去
Take this ring back.

1183
01:13:03,938 --> 01:13:05,462
亚德利打电话来了
Yardley called the hotel.

1184
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,405
你告诉他了?
Did you tell him?

1185
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:09,705
我和他说沃德在沙滩上被人打劫了
I told him Ward got mugged and beaten on the beach.

1186
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:14,712
好吧 那他说什么?
Well, what'd he say?

1187
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:17,148
没什么
Not much.

1188
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:19,209
他只想知道他是不是还活着
Wanted to know if he was gonna make it.

1189
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:21,619
我告诉他情况并不严重
When I told him it wasn't serious,

1190
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,954
- 他好像就没什么兴趣了  - 看来他近来帮不了什么忙了
- he kind of just lost interest.  - Well, he's not gonna be much help for a while.

1191
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:28,052
他听起来不需要谁帮忙
Didn't sound like he needed much help.

1192
01:13:28,129 --> 01:13:30,563
他不能一个人写这篇报道 夏洛特
He can't go write the story alone, Charlotte.

1193
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:33,657
- 好吧 我们只能等着瞧了  - 他知道的不够
- Well, we'll just have to see.  - He doesn't know enough about it.

1194
01:13:33,735 --> 01:13:35,532
这不只是为了一篇报道 杰克
This isn't about a newspaper article, Jack.

1195
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,128
这关乎一个人的生命
It's about a person's life.

1196
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:38,832
这才是我们在这的目的 好吗?
That's the whole point we're here, okay?

1197
01:13:38,906 --> 01:13:40,669
是为了一个人的生命
So it's about someone's life.

1198
01:13:43,478 --> 01:13:46,311
宝贝 别走
Baby, don't go.

1199
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,508
你让我已经思维混乱了
You're starting to screw with my head.

1200
01:13:50,418 --> 01:13:52,318
听着 你还是个孩子 好吗?
Look, you're a good kid, all right?

1201
01:13:52,387 --> 01:13:55,515
你是...
You're...

1202
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,855
你... 你有大好前程
You... you got your whole life ahead of you,

1203
01:13:58,926 --> 01:14:00,393
还想要我?
and you want me?

1204
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,993
杰克去了"迈阿密时报"
Jack went down to "The Miami Times",

1205
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,435
试图阻止亚德利发表那篇文章
to try to stop Yardley from publishing the article.

1206
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,033
他不想那上面有他哥哥的名字
He didn't want his brother's name on it.

1207
01:14:15,943 --> 01:14:17,604
杰克
Jack.

1208
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:20,942
嗨
Hi.

1209
01:14:21,015 --> 01:14:24,951
嘿 沃德呢? 你哥哥现在怎样了?
Hey. How's Ward? How's your brother doing?

1210
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:27,044
他从昨天起就一直想和你联系
Been trying to get ahold of you since yesterday.

1211
01:14:27,121 --> 01:14:29,715
很好 看来他情况还没那么坏
Good. He's obviously not doing so badly then.

1212
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:34,728
抱歉 我不想被打扰 来吧 坐 坐
Sorry, I didn't want any distractions. Come, sit, sit.

1213
01:14:34,796 --> 01:14:37,128
他想看看你都写了什么
He wants to read what you're writing.

1214
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:39,723
我一写完会第一个给他看的 和以前一样
As soon as I'm done, he'll be the first to read it, as always.

1215
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:42,895
妈的! 别跟我讲这些废话!
Damn it! I'm so sick of your shit, man!

1216
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,835
这上面也写着他的名字
His name is on that, too.

1217
01:14:44,906 --> 01:14:47,898
他想在出版前看一看
He wants to read it before it's published.

1218
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:49,738
好吧? 仅此而已
Okay? That's it.

1219
01:14:49,811 --> 01:14:52,405
他只是想提前看一看
He just wants to read it before it's published.

1220
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,573
你必须弄清事实
You got to get those facts straight.

1221
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:56,913
你必须弄清全部的事实
You got to get all the facts straight.

1222
01:14:56,984 --> 01:14:59,578
你越来越像你哥哥了
You're starting to sound like your brother.

1223
01:14:59,654 --> 01:15:02,214
听着 我们有交稿期限
Look, we have a deadline here.

1224
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,224
我告诉过你 这就是新闻行业
I've told you, this is the newspaper business.

1225
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:05,987
我们没有时间弄清全部的事实
We don't have time to get all the facts.

1226
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,824
我们都知道希拉里被莱特利镇的市民冤枉了
We both know the town of Lately set Hillary up.

1227
01:15:08,896 --> 01:15:11,990
- 我们已经够料了  - 这根本他妈不是真相!
- We've got the story.  - It's not the fucking truth!

1228
01:15:12,066 --> 01:15:14,796
你想知道什么他妈才是真相?
You want to talk about the motherfucking truth?

1229
01:15:18,339 --> 01:15:21,331
你以为我是伦敦人?
You thought I was from London?

1230
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:23,434
如果不把自己装成黑种的007
Ain't no Negro getting a job up in this spot,

1231
01:15:23,511 --> 01:15:26,810
一个黑人不可能做到这个位置 明白没?
unless he's a colored motherfucking James Bond, you dig?

1232
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:31,785
有次我喝醉了 把沃德给干了
I got drunk once and let Ward suck my dick.

1233
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,918
他被黑人干过 现在他恨死了自己
He got a taste for niggers and now he hates himself.

1234
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,355
这就是真相
That's the truth.

1235
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,958
回去你哥哥那 小孩
Go back to your brother, boy.

1236
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:48,127
我要赶稿了
I have got a deadline to meet.

1237
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:26,164
你好?
Hello?

1238
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,801
让沃德接电话
Put Ward on the phone.

1239
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,675
你为什么在文章上署他的名?
Why'd you put his byline on that article?

1240
01:16:32,747 --> 01:16:34,408
你凭什么署他的名?
How could you sign his name on that?

1241
01:16:34,482 --> 01:16:36,473
告诉他我们把希拉里救出来了
Tell him we got Hillary out.

1242
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:38,348
州长赦免了他
The governor's gonna pardon him.

1243
01:16:41,489 --> 01:16:43,354
希拉里被放出来了
Hillary's getting out.

1244
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:48,987
"最近几个月我回想了很多
"I've had some time to think over the past few months,

1245
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:52,590
关于你 我的事
about me, about you.

1246
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:55,261
我还不确定自己想要什么样的生活
I'm not sure I found what I want out of life yet.

1247
01:16:55,336 --> 01:16:58,931
我只知道我不想过没有你的日子
All I know is that I don't want to live it without you.

1248
01:16:59,006 --> 01:17:01,839
请收回这枚戒指 爱你的 杰克"
Please take this ring back. Love, Jack."

1249
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:11,441
去开门
Get the door.

1250
01:17:15,356 --> 01:17:18,189
快他妈的去开门 婊子!
Get the fucking door, bitch!

1251
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:35,400
你他妈是谁?
Who the fuck are you?

1252
01:17:35,476 --> 01:17:37,376
- 我是希拉里  - 你他妈想干嘛?
- I'm Hillary.  - What the fuck do you want?

1253
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:39,072
滚出去! 我找夏洛特
Get the fuck out! I'm with Charlotte.

1254
01:17:39,146 --> 01:17:40,807
- 那婊子拿了我的...  - 一会儿叫你!
- That bitch took my...  - I'll call you later!

1255
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:46,746
夏洛特 要不要我报警?
Charlotte, you want me to call the police?

1256
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:58,164
你在这儿
There she is.

1257
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:00,832
抱歉 我...
I'm sorry. I... you see,

1258
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:02,493
我本来想给你写信...
I was gonna write you a letter and I was gonna...

1259
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:04,936
不 我不想看你的信 过来
No, I don't need your letters. Come here.

1260
01:18:18,419 --> 01:18:19,818
别碰我
Don't touch me.

1261
01:18:19,887 --> 01:18:21,582
快过来 别碰你?
Come on here. Don't touch you?

1262
01:18:24,025 --> 01:18:25,287
别碰你?
Don't touch you?

1263
01:18:27,928 --> 01:18:29,828
好吧
It's okay.

1264
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:31,987
没事的 宝贝
It's all right, baby.

1265
01:18:41,642 --> 01:18:43,974
能为我做件事吗?
You want to do something for me?

1266
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,538
什么都可以
Anything.

1267
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:57,353
没事的
That's all right.

1268
01:19:15,076 --> 01:19:17,306
你在第三封信里说你爱我
You told me you loved me in your third letter.

1269
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:19,403
你爱我吗?
Do you love me?

1270
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:21,848
就这样!
Yes!

1271
01:19:45,773 --> 01:19:48,765
你总是这样干女人吗?
You always fuck like this?

1272
01:19:48,843 --> 01:19:50,504
上一次也是这样吗?
Like it was the last time?

1273
01:19:57,518 --> 01:19:59,452
你觉得我漂亮吗?
Do you think I'm pretty?

1274
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,010
你跟那些黑鬼也像这样干吗?
You fuck those niggers like this?

1275
01:20:08,863 --> 01:20:11,593
全都插进去了!
Gonna get all inside here!

1276
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:17,064
现在打包你的东西跟我走
Now pack your shit and let's go.

1277
01:20:23,477 --> 01:20:26,708
我觉得我不会喜欢住在沼泽里的
I don't think I'm gonna like living in a swamp.

1278
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:30,808
我不想住在沼泽里 我喜欢这儿
I don't want to live in a swamp. I like it here.

1279
01:20:33,387 --> 01:20:37,756
这就是他们爱的宣誓
And that was their declaration of love.

1280
01:20:37,825 --> 01:20:40,555
然后希拉里带着夏洛特回了沼泽
So Hillary took Charlotte to the swamp.

1281
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:56,272
- 你听说过老亨利吗?  - 没有
- So did you hear about old man Henry?  - No.

1282
01:20:56,343 --> 01:20:59,005
他在后院的水边喝醉了
He got drunk in his back yard by the water,

1283
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:02,071
然后鳄鱼过来在他的腿上咬了一大口
and the alligators came out and took a big chunk of his leg.

1284
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,418
哈 玩笑而已
Ha. Just joking.

1285
01:21:07,087 --> 01:21:08,782
我那个自大的老爹
My daddy rooster, he got jumped,

1286
01:21:08,856 --> 01:21:10,585
被他的三个儿子搞垮了
by three of his sons,

1287
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,627
所以我还得给他们三个找地方住
so I need to find a home for three of them.

1288
01:21:13,694 --> 01:21:15,787
他们现在在我房子里
So he's in my house sitting,

1289
01:21:15,863 --> 01:21:17,922
所以我需要... 我知道你那儿有几个女人
so I need... I know you only have hens.

1290
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,432
所以我想知道 你愿不愿意照看孩子
That's why I was wondering, you know, if you want to babysit,

1291
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:22,696
你知道的 收养他们三个
you know, adopt three of them for you.

1292
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:26,433
- 不过他们会很好的 因为你那儿有女人  - 不
- But they'd be good though, because you have hens.  - No.

1293
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,908
- 你是我唯一的希望了  - 不! 我一个都不想养
- You're my only hope.  - No! I don't want any.

1294
01:21:29,977 --> 01:21:31,274
别这样 夏洛特
Come on, Charlotte.

1295
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:33,142
我需要你帮我个忙
I need you to do me a favor.

1296
01:21:33,214 --> 01:21:34,806
我需要你帮我寄这封信
I need you to post this thing for me.

1297
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:36,941
上面没有邮票
It ain't got a stamp on it.

1298
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,609
- 你今天怎么了?  - 这封信很重要
- What's wrong with you today?  - It's real important.

1299
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:40,210
你能帮我这件事吗?
You think you can do that for me?

1300
01:21:40,287 --> 01:21:42,050
你今天都不像你了
You're not acting yourself today.

1301
01:21:46,961 --> 01:21:49,794
你的门为什么开着 哼?
Why's your door open, huh?

1302
01:21:52,466 --> 01:21:53,956
屋子里一股尿骚味
Smells like piss in here.

1303
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,662
沃德 沃德说你可能会过来
Ward Ward said you might show up.

1304
01:21:56,737 --> 01:21:58,068
我给他留了纸条
Left him a note.

1305
01:21:59,406 --> 01:22:01,169
你身上臭死了
You stink.

1306
01:22:01,242 --> 01:22:02,903
我站在这儿都能闻得到
I can smell you from over here.

1307
01:22:02,977 --> 01:22:06,174
过来 孩子 过来坐
Come here, boy. Come sit down.

1308
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:08,306
你为什么回去迈阿密?
What you doing back in Miami?

1309
01:22:12,419 --> 01:22:13,909
亚德利走了
Yardley's gone.

1310
01:22:14,922 --> 01:22:16,082
他放弃了吗?
He quit?

1311
01:22:16,156 --> 01:22:17,589
没有
No.

1312
01:22:20,361 --> 01:22:22,022
他在纽约
He's in New York.

1313
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:25,857
签了几本书的合约
Signing some book deal.

1314
01:22:25,933 --> 01:22:30,097
新新闻界的英雄还是什么鬼东西的 我也不知道
Hero of the new journalism or some kind of shit. I don't know.

1315
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:33,003
老爹让艾伦搬进去了 是吗?
W.W. moved Ellen into the house, huh?

1316
01:22:35,009 --> 01:22:36,271
管他的呢
Whatever.

1317
01:22:37,778 --> 01:22:39,837
他高兴就行
Whatever makes him happy.

1318
01:23:07,574 --> 01:23:09,633
根本就没有什么开发商 杰克
There wasn't no developer, Jack.

1319
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,244
好了 我们动身
All right, let's move.

1320
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,812
快点 去洗澡 沃德
Come on, go shower, Ward.

1321
01:23:20,888 --> 01:23:22,879
我累了
I'm tired.

1322
01:23:24,992 --> 01:23:26,152
快去
Come on.

1323
01:23:28,095 --> 01:23:30,063
天呐
Jeez.

1324
01:23:43,777 --> 01:23:46,109
我总觉得有什么疏漏的地方 杰克
I keep thinking I missed something, Jack.

1325
01:23:50,684 --> 01:23:52,481
我好像疏忽了什么地方
Like I missed something I was supposed to see,

1326
01:23:52,553 --> 01:23:54,180
触手可及的
that was right in front of me.

1327
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:55,744
比方说什么?
Like what?

1328
01:23:58,959 --> 01:24:00,517
那件事的重点
The point of it.

1329
01:24:01,695 --> 01:24:03,128
没关系
Doesn't matter.

1330
01:24:05,299 --> 01:24:07,529
所有事情都失去控制了
Things got out of hand.

1331
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:09,592
你受伤了
You got hurt,

1332
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,138
亚德利签了该死的合同
Yardley got his fucking book deal.

1333
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,468
希拉里带夏洛特去了沼泽
Hillary got Charlotte in the swamp.

1334
01:24:18,612 --> 01:24:23,276
我的想法... 是... 别浪费水了
The idea... is that... you run the water,

1335
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,550
快点进去洗澡
while you're in there with it.

1336
01:24:26,053 --> 01:24:27,213
快点 老兄
Come on, man.

1337
01:24:34,561 --> 01:24:35,892
嘿
Hey.

1338
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:46,232
要是我们搞不定呢 嗯?
What if we didn't get it right, huh?

1339
01:24:47,474 --> 01:24:48,964
那也没差
Makes no difference.

1340
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:50,635
没差吗 杰克?
It makes no difference, Jack?

1341
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,201
你根本不知道
You don't know what it feels like,

1342
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:54,509
我现在是什么感受
to get it exactly right now.

1343
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:58,449
只能让事情顺其自然
To get it down just the way it happened.

1344
01:24:58,519 --> 01:25:00,146
你准备回去看希拉里
You're going back to see Hillary.

1345
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,744
靠 没错
Fuck yeah, I am.

1346
01:25:01,822 --> 01:25:04,416
你有她的消息吗?
Do you ever hear from her?

1347
01:25:04,491 --> 01:25:05,822
没有
No.

1348
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:07,827
- 布莱斯小姐?  - 没有
- Miss Bless?  - No.

1349
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:10,261
我想知道她现在认为他怎么样 嗯?
I wonder what she thinks of him now, huh?

1350
01:25:12,433 --> 01:25:14,526
看不到她坐在门廊上
Can't see her sitting on the porch stoop,

1351
01:25:14,601 --> 01:25:16,660
拿着银勺
holding a silver spoon,

1352
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:19,205
等着别人把冰激凌拿过来 你看得到吗?
and waiting for the ice cream carton to come her way, can you?

1353
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:23,672
我调查过了
I dug around.

1354
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:26,178
根本没有证据 没有原因 没有地点
There wasn't no proof, no how, nowhere,
