1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,760
Just tell me when you're rolling.

2
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,050
We're rolling.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,730
A lot of people...

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,980
Have questioned what really happened.

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,110
And when the novel was first published
it didn't take long for...

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,110
there to be even more questions asked.

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,820
It's always remained a mystery.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,240
and that's why I wanted to thank you for coming in

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:48,130
to meet with us.
To help shed some light on the events.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,750
OK...

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,840
He dedicated the book to you.

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,470
Can you tell us how much of his novel
was based on fact?

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,390
All of it. 1969...

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,520
What can you tell us about that summer?

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,780
Question? What was the question?

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,030
What do you remember about that summer 19697?

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,240
It was hot. It was real hot.

18
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,120
God must have been sweatin', it was so hot.

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,210
Tell me about the murder.

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,970
Hey, how much,
how much I'm gettin' paid for this?

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,810
Well, Sheriff Call was this evil, nasty,
disgusting son of a gun.

22
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,530
Black people hated Sheriff Call because

23
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,490
he killed so many of us during his
two terms in service.

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,340
Some of my family was included.

25
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,840
White people feared him too.

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,140
So somebody got fed up with his fat ass,
and killed him.

27
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,440
That's what happened that summer.

28
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,300
They say he dragged his intestines
for a mile before he died.

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,640
Crazy white people even built a statue for him.

30
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,110
How did it come about that you worked
for the Jansens?

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,410
I was cleaning for them part time,
right when his mamma ran off.

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,580
And Ward and I, Ward was his brother,

33
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,500
he was in high school at the time
and we raised him together.

34
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,210
Little Jackie was five at the time.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,790
Where was his father?

36
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,670
W.W. was just...

37
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,260
Chasing girls, you know
And running the local newspaper.

38
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,390
The Moat County Tribune.

39
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,270
How's Ward?

40
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,350
He's good, he's good. Real busy.

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,730
Ward was a writer for the Miami Times.

42
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,530
He used to write about uh...
well he was kind of famous,

43
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,990
you know, cause he wrote
about the Civil Rights movement

44
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,620
and the poor and the unjustly accused.

45
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,300
That's how come that lady Charlotte
started writing letters to him.

46
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,590
Stuff like that.

47
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,180
And then Jack, like I said, he was a swimmer.

48
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,640
And uh, almost professional, very close but

49
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,390
he then he got kicked off the swim team,

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,390
he got kicked out of college,
and he came back home to

51
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,810
his papa's house to deliver newspapers.

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
He didn't want to come back home,

53
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,690
but he didn't have nowhere else to go.

54
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,790
Jack, you better turn that music down.

55
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,210
You know your W.W. gon' be made at you.

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,920
Dang it Anita, can you... please knock.

57
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,670
I could have been jerking off in here.

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,340
Please, it ain't nothing I ain't seen before.

59
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,060
What are you doing?

60
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm picking up your stuff, like I do every day.

61
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,730
Oh come on not today, it's too hot for that.

62
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,190
I'm just helping.

63
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,650
You're not helping me, you don't have to help me.

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,610
Come on.

65
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,570
Get off the bed so I can make it.

66
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,360
Go fix me some collard greens.

67
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,650
It's my bed.

68
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,200
I know it's your bed. Really?

69
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,870
Because it's your bed, you should fucking make it.

70
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,250
They cancelled "The Smothers Brothers."

71
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,210
Oh, no, that's your show.

72
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,540
Well, I love that show.
I love Dick and I love Tommy.

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,170
Lay down. Let me be you for a second.

74
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,760
Oh, yeah, right. Get me in trouble.

75
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,720
You want to be me, I get to be you? Okay.

76
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,340
Okay, I'll love this.

77
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,640
Jack, may I come in? Oh, good, okay.

78
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,640
Go away, go out. Go back out.

79
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,390
OK.

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,440
I better start jerking off first.

81
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,100
Okay.

82
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,190
Jack, sorry to interrupt your masturbation,

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,770
but I'm here to clean the bed!

84
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
I could've been jerking off!

85
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,650
I'm gonna clean everything!

86
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,650
I could have been jerking off!

87
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,200
Get out! Clean my shit up!

88
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,080
... get all that we have received in return,

89
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,410
is just another smooth exercise
in political manipulation.

90
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,500
Deceit and deception,

91
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,250
callousness and indifference to
our individual problems.

92
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,760
And the disgusting plane of divisive politics.

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,340
Pitting the young against the old.

94
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,850
Labor against management. North against south.

95
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,010
- Did you want to see me?
- Black against White.

96
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,180
Yeah.

97
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,770
Have you spoken to Ward this week?

98
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,600
No.

99
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,810
Hello, Jack.

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,560
He didn't mention anything to you about coming here?

101
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,820
I can't believe your father's making me report on this.

102
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,900
I mean, look at her.

103
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,400
... to open our society.

104
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,910
You know, she plans to run for President next.

105
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,660
They want to talk to Hillary Van Wetter.

106
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,660
Don't you let that Pulitzer Prize fool you.

107
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,790
He don't know everything yet.

108
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,550
Ain't no reason to come up here
stirring up shit with that asshole.

109
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,890
... I just wanted to say that it is
very important for all Americans to recognize...

110
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,520
Charlotte Bless loved her some dangerous men.

111
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,560
She wrote men in prison.
She finally fell in love with one.

112
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,310
She was determined to get him out.

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,190
Why y'all ain't got no ice in here?

114
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,820
You want ice, go to your house.

115
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,860
Charlotte.

116
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,950
Oh, that's my show.

117
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,240
What you think, Charlotte?

118
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,660
I don't like it. Make it looser.

119
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,370
That's that nigger you've been writing?

120
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,950
No. This is my white man.

121
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,670
What happened yesterday? I missed it.

122
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,460
Listen to this. He thinks I'm his angel.

123
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,880
His angel?

124
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,260
Shut your face.

125
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,590
Bitch, how old is he?

126
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,510
Oh, my God.

127
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,050
He's a fine motherfucker that's trying to fuck you.

128
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,390
Ever there was an angel in the world,

129
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,430
my angel, it must be you,

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,520
"but no angel would do the things
I dream that you want."

131
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,810
Your angel, his angel.

132
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,900
That's hot.

133
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,570
He say, "If you truly exist,
I may become a religious man.

134
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:25,420
All my life, my heart has tried to
find a place I cannot name,

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,130
a home.

136
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,460
You need to find yourself a young one.
He'll fuck you real good.

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,130
He says I'm his home.

138
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,140
Got a hundred different men writing her
from the penitentiary.

139
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,600
That's her man.

140
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,140
Oh, no. This is my man.

141
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,520
This here's the one.

142
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,780
Ward came home to investigate
the conviction of Hillary Van Wetter.

143
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,790
The town wasn't too happy about it
and neither was his papa.

144
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Ward...

145
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,670
there's a horse in the parking lot.

146
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
It's our ride home, Yardley.

147
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,930
Where is everybody?

148
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,100
It's Sunday, people's either at home or at church.

149
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,610
It's a shithole.

150
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,790
Hey, man.

151
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,040
Hey, you.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,170
How you doing?

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,630
- Jack, meet Yardley Acheman.
- Hey.

154
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
My little brother, Jack.

155
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,050
The swimmer, right?

156
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,970
Yeah, he's our driver now.

157
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,010
Right, good.

158
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,970
Here, let me get these.

159
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,980
- That's my typewriter.
- You've gotten big, boy.

160
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,650
Just be careful with the typewriter.

161
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,980
Got all pumped up. Is that from swimming?

162
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,980
Not anymore.

163
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,700
No! No! No!

164
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,950
Yardley's real particular about his suits
and his typewriter.

165
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,660
Well, it's very expensive.

166
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,750
Yes. Thank you.

167
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,050
How do I get in?

168
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,010
Watch your head. Watch your head.

169
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Don't touch my head.

170
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,220
Tell him where you're from, Yardley.

171
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,270
London.

172
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,440
When I came here from New York,

173
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,280
I was interviewing for the job,
and I was in advertising in New York

174
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,240
and I mentioned that it was simply different
in New York.

175
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,670
So how'd you get from New York City

176
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,840
to the metropolis of Lately, Florida?

177
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,800
Jansen residence.

178
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,340
So I came down south
and I interviewed at the paper.

179
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,220
W.W., Miss Roberta's on the phone.

180
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,890
No, no, no. We don't take phone calls. Anita...

181
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,180
Who's Miss Roberta?

182
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,730
No calls, Anita.

183
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,900
What part of London you from, Yardley?

184
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,820
Um, all over London.
Is there a good dry cleaner's here?

185
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,120
All over? Excuse me?

186
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,030
Dry cleaning.

187
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,870
- Dry cleaning?
- Yes.

188
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,870
You ain't gonna eat that, are you?

189
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,750
How you gonna win those
swimming meets if you don't eat?

190
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,050
I'm retired.

191
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,930
Retired. Jack, you ain't even tired
enough to be retired.

192
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,520
How is it exactly you guys work?

193
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,520
I mean, like that boy drowned at his initiation?

194
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,650
Well, Yardley's the writer.

195
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,820
And I'd guess you'd say Ward is the nuts and bolts.

196
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,700
Yeah. When I was a reporter,

197
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,780
we had rewrite men who took
the stories over the phone.

198
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,990
No, no. I'm not a rewrite man. I'm the writer.

199
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm the one who puts the facts into perspective.

200
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,620
Oh!

201
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,460
Yes. It's a different world now, Mr. Jansen.

202
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,470
Clearly.

203
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,510
Times have changed a bit, sir.

204
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,430
What interest does "The Miami Times"
have in Hillary Van Wetter?

205
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,430
He murdered somebody in jail?

206
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,810
Even if he was guilty--

207
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,390
It was a lynching, pure and simple.

208
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,600
- -he has certain rights.

209
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,400
And even if he was guilty,
Hillary has rights that

210
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,070
the process completely disregarded.

211
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,820
And that's why we're here.

212
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,870
I'm very sorry, everybody,
but I'm going to have to leave.

213
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,990
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

214
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,370
I have early evaluations first thing in the morning.

215
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,080
- Come here, sugar.
- I apologize.

216
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,580
All right, buddy.

217
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,550
Ward?

218
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,880
Good night, boys.

219
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,010
Ward?

220
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,930
Seems mighty sure of himself for a colored.

221
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,900
Ward said they need a driver.

222
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,980
A driver?

223
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,190
What you do out there?

224
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,860
So you meet anybody new up there in Miami?

225
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,490
I met a few.

226
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,530
Oh, yeah.

227
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,240
All types down there, you know?

228
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,870
You stay away from those rough ones.

229
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Remember what happened the last time.

230
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,630
How your kids?

231
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,210
You look beautiful, babe.

232
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,380
Oh, they're doing good,
they're doing really good.

233
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,720
As soon as I get out of here,

234
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,720
I'll go see them and make dinner all over again.

235
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,350
You should come to that dinner, too.

236
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,100
I'l come to that dinner.

237
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,190
I think Ellen is maybe number four since you left.

238
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,740
Yeah.

239
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,160
That's why I don't take them bitches
too seriously, you know?

240
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,240
They come and they go and they come and they go.

241
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,620
You know what I mean?

242
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,470
How you doing there, Yard?

243
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,850
Oh, jeez.

244
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,070
Hey, close that door, boy.

245
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,070
I don't want your daddy screaming about
all the flies getting in the house.

246
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,280
Who is that, Jack?

247
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,210
I'm looking for the office of Mr. Jansen.

248
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,130
Ward Jansen of "The Miami Times."

249
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,250
I said who is it?

250
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,840
I work for "The Times."

251
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,380
- You do?
- Yeah.

252
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,180
Well, I'm Charlotte Bless.

253
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,680
I'm Jack Jansen.

254
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,640
- Here, let me get that.
- Oh.

255
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,390
- Hey.
- All my files.

256
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,270
The office is in the garage.

257
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,940
You look a little young to be a journalist.

258
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,280
I'm really just the driver.

259
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,150
Oh.

260
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,490
But I do write.

261
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,660
So do I. I write letters, I'm pretty good.

262
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,000
Hey, guys!

263
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,500
This here is Miss Charlotte Bless.

264
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,420
Oh not for long.

265
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,130
Hillary and I are engaged to be married.

266
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,880
Hello, Miss Bless. I'm Ward.

267
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,010
Oh, Mr. Ward, good to finally meet you.

268
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,010
You didn't mention the engagement
in your letters.

269
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,840
Goddamn it Ward, go clean yourself up.

270
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,180
Well, it only just happened. He just proposed.

271
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,220
Oh, that looks nasty.

272
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,510
Well, how did I do that?

273
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,310
Excuse me a second. Get Miss Bless
something to drink.

274
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm Yardley Acheman.

275
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,520
We thought you and Hillary hadn't met.

276
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,020
Well, only in pictures...

277
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,560
but we been writing each other for months

278
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,020
and we understand ourselves just perfect.

279
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,980
Well, Ward, where should I put her files?

280
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,820
Everything you need to know about
Hillary Van Wetter that's been in the papers...

281
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,990
is here in these boxes.

282
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,580
Now and our exciting correspondence
is in the bottom box.

283
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,200
In case you're interested.

284
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,160
My desk, Jackie boy.

285
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,010
Mr. Jansen, I really just wanted to thank you.

286
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,010
I wanted to thank you for returning my letters.

287
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,140
And for helping me get
Hillary out of that hellhole.

288
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,310
Well, I wouldn't go booking
the honeymoon just yet.

289
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,270
But we are going to fight his sentence
and the way it came about.

290
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,390
Thank you. Thank you so much.

291
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,110
Nobody deserves the death penalty, Miss Bless.

292
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,320
Not even Hillary Van Wetter.

293
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,450
Um, excuse me.
Everything is ordered alphabetically.

294
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,200
I was telling um...

295
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,410
- what's your name?
- Yardley.

296
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,160
Yardley. Um, that all of the files,

297
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,500
Um, everything that's been in the papers,
is in the top box.

298
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,290
This is gonna be a great help.

299
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,290
He's an innocent man.
You're gonna find that out.

300
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,090
Wrongly convicted.

301
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,920
This is gonna get us off to a great start.

302
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,260
I've done a lot of research.

303
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,470
I see that.

304
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,760
In the meantime, you need
to freshen up or anything?

305
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,640
Jack show Miss Bless the washroom.

306
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,100
No, I think I'll just stay here.

307
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,770
You might have some questions
that you need answered.

308
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,390
I can freshen up just here.

309
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,270
Cold beer for me, Jack.

310
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,150
You're adorable, Jack.

311
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,150
I will take an iced tea if you have it.

312
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
- You want anything Ward?
- I'm good.

313
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,740
You'll see uh... it's an enormous amount of...

314
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,030
I don't know what to do here.

315
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,160
What's with the boxes?

316
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,830
Well, we're gonna start on it.

317
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,620
My Jack was in love with Charlotte Bless.

318
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,460
I could tell that horny little boy wanted
to jump her on first sight.

319
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,720
Everybody was confused why she was
engaged to Hillary Van Wetter.

320
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,640
Nasty, white trash swamp.

321
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,060
"All the killers who have written me
want to press their mouths

322
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,270
into my vagina and some,
even the crack of my behind,

323
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,690
except Hillary Van Wetter.

324
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,150
He has no such desire."

325
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,820
"He wants to be sucked off himself.

326
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,410
I consider this psychological proof of his innocence."

327
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,120
She is one nasty little nut job.

328
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,500
Think we've been taking her
a little too seriously.

329
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,250
You sure get bored quick.

330
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,510
No. Can tell I'm not going to get laid anytime soon
in this Floridian shit pit, so...

331
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,470
Hey, Kathy, it's me.

332
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,350
"Hillary tells her that the knife
and the bloodied shirt...

333
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,850
What do you mean, who? Yardley.

334
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,680
... that the deputies claim to
have found in his house

335
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,020
somehow got lost before the trial.

336
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,850
Yeah, I miss you, too.

337
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,770
What?

338
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,570
Hello, Kathy.

339
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,360
Miss Bless wanted to look at the prison.

340
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,240
Jack's first assignment was to take her there.

341
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,540
I bet he knows I'm here.

342
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,910
See, people who fall in love outside of...

343
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:39,090
a normal relationship, they have these powers,
telepathic powers.

344
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,470
Hillary and I have that kind of connection,
you dig?

345
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,350
Now why ain't you in college?

346
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,940
Uh, I was... a swimmer when I was in school.

347
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,940
No kidding?

348
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,570
Yeah.

349
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,110
I was a swimmer.

350
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,240
You were?

351
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,070
I'd swim like a mermaid

352
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,530
if it wasn't for my damn curly hair.

353
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,410
I think straight hair gives me class.

354
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,580
All right.

355
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,090
So...

356
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,630
Well, we was drunk one night, and uh...

357
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:31,770
I just... I lost my temper.
Well, I emptied the pool.

358
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,350
At your college?

359
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,270
The University of Florida.

360
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,440
They called that vandalism, I guess..

361
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,820
It's actually not as easy to do as it sounds.

362
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,570
So you lose your temper often?

363
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,750
This place is full of boys just like you
who lost their temper one day.

364
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm getting horny being this close to him.

365
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,220
I bet he's horny for me all the time.

366
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,810
Oh, I can feel him.

367
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,650
Can I help you folks?

368
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,540
Yes, Officer. We just wanted to sit in your
parking lot for a little while.

369
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,460
What for?

370
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,250
Well, his daddy's in there and we wanted to
send him good vibrations.

371
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,630
Some good what?

372
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,550
Oh, these special things called good vibrations.

373
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,350
Sorry, ma'am. Y'all can't park here.

374
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,720
Oh.

375
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,350
Yes, Officer.

376
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,320
The story that Hillary told the deputies
was never investigated.

377
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,780
He simply told it once from the witness stand

378
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,950
and was never asked to elaborate,

379
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,660
not even by his own lawyers.

380
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,220
Good to see you again, Ward.

381
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,470
Nice to see you.

382
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,570
Sir, this is my writing partner,
Mr. Yardley Acheman.

383
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,410
Of course.

384
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,030
I suppose the best place to start
would be the beginning.

385
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,250
I was born in this county.

386
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,460
1897, to poor but proud parents.

387
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,330
Mr. Pine, could we skip...

388
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,250
65 years, save everyone some time?

389
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,380
Hillary Van Wetter, 19657?

390
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,100
Oh, I can't agree to talk to you
about that matter.

391
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,060
Not without my client's permission.

392
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,600
He's entitled to his privacy,
just like anybody else.

393
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,140
You have his permission.

394
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,560
He wrote you.

395
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,360
I'll have to check that out.

396
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,030
I'm sure the letters would be in your files, Mr. Pine.

397
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Well, that's what you say,

398
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,030
but I have a client to protect.

399
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,490
Look here.

400
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,120
If we have to get a lawyer of our
own down here to sort this out,

401
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,330
then while he's here, we're gonna
have him look through

402
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,330
every aspect of Mr. Van Wetter's case.

403
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,170
Including the competency of his defense.

404
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,920
There was nothing wrong with the
defense Hillary Van Wetter got in court!

405
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,720
Then you have nothing to worry
about from us.

406
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,640
We just want to talk to him.
Then we'll be out of your...

407
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,970
You don't know a thing about this person!

408
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,890
You've been in this world for five minutes, boy!

409
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,310
Well, now that's just not necessary, Mr. Pine.

410
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,650
I talk the way I want in my office!

411
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,690
All right. Then you'll arrange the meeting,
will you?

412
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,370
Quick! We're gonna be late!

413
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,750
You get the marriage license?

414
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,810
I can't believe we're doing this!

415
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,400
Fuck! Jack, go knock on the door again.

416
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,740
There she is. Whoa, baby.

417
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,490
I say...

418
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,870
Good morning, Miss Bless.

419
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,830
Look at Daisy Mae.

420
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,790
Morning.

421
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,080
You look just fine.

422
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,880
Hope he likes it.

423
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,930
Would you mind putting up the windows?
It's gonna muss my hair.

424
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,390
Are you serious?

425
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,440
I'm sweating like a pregnant nun back here.

426
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,150
Unbelievable.

427
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,670
Hi.

428
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,390
You got 15 minutes.

429
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,600
No physical contact of any kind.
No tape recorders.

430
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,610
No object may be passed to the prisoner.

431
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,480
I'll be right outside this door.

432
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,660
Mr. Van Wetter, my name is Ward Jansen.

433
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,620
This is my associate, Yardley Acheman.

434
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,540
You look like your picture.

435
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,170
I do?

436
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,800
Thank you.

437
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,510
These your paperboys?

438
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,730
What they gonna do for us?

439
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,850
They gonna save you.

440
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,690
They're gonna save us?

441
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,620
Shit. They can't even save themselves.

442
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,200
Mr. Van Wetter, we wanted to ask you

443
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,790
about the lost evidence in your case...

444
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,580
Shut up. Can't you see I'm busy?

445
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,170
Will you do something for me right now?

446
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,550
Oh, I wish I could.

447
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,850
Spread your legs open a little bit.

448
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,780
Yeah, now tear off them pantyhose.

449
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,700
Rip those off.

450
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,030
Yeah. Move your hands away.

451
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,550
Now open up your mouth...

452
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,220
mention what you wrote me in your letters.

453
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,220
You bitch!

454
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,330
You're a good girl.

455
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,630
What the hell's going on in here? I warned y'all!

456
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,010
This visit's over!
I told y'all this visit was-- come on!

457
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,640
- This visit's over.
- No! No! No!!!

458
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,970
There's nothing going on!

459
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,430
Shit! No!

460
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,020
What the fuck?

461
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,440
I didn't touch that girl!

462
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,770
What the fuck you laughing about?

463
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,950
Come on now, Miss Bless.

464
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,660
Jack came home and threw up after that.

465
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,040
He couldn't believe he still loved her
after what he saw,

466
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,290
but he did.

467
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,160
You're Ward Ward's boy?

468
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,790
Most contrary man in all of Moat County.

469
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,920
What may I do for you gentlemen today?

470
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,300
[t's about the murder of Sheriff Call.

471
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,890
I understand that there's some physical
evidence relating to the case that was lost?

472
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,270
Yes, sir. I believe there was.

473
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,480
Well, we was wondering what sort of explanation
the department might have.

474
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,230
I wish I knew.

475
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,860
Mr. Van Wetter once cut a deputy's thumb off.

476
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,910
Did you know that?

477
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,370
It was over a traffic ticket, if I remember.

478
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,790
You can't do much without your thumb.

479
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,040
It's what separates us from the primates.

480
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,300
For a little thing like holding
your wife's titty...

481
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,340
You're not married, Mr. Jansen?

482
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,470
No.

483
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,810
A little thing like that, you can't do it.

484
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,100
Maybe I'll just go talk to the deputies
who was involved in the arrest.

485
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,730
You can talk to whoever you want
as long as they'll talk to you.

486
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,780
- But they won't.
- And why is that?

487
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,860
Because they haven't forgotten

488
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,150
what Hillary did to one of their own.

489
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,030
The judge allowed testimony based on
evidence that he never even saw.

490
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,450
He took the officer's word over Hillary's.

491
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,250
I can't say I blame him. Nobody does.

492
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,270
So you've got to ask him.

493
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,560
Where was he between 2:00 and 6:00?

494
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,400
I'm gonna ask him about some things he wrote,

495
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,110
some letters to Charlotte.

496
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,740
Here we go.

497
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,860
Hold.

498
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,830
Good morning, Mr. Van Wetter.

499
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,160
Hey.

500
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,420
Where's your dress?

501
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,250
You don't like me like this?

502
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,130
You know a prisoner by the name of--

503
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,720
Ward, Ward, Ward.

504
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,300
You know a prisoner by the name of
Mr. Bobby Valentine?

505
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,140
Mr. Van Wetter?

506
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,020
Mr. Demarcus Williams, Mr. Bobby Hinton?

507
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,140
Another prisoner by the name of Jimmy Edwards,

508
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,650
another one, Demarcus. I think his name is Curt.

509
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,690
I forgot his last name.

510
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,650
Anyway, you know what they all have in common?

511
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,150
Hey, Martin Luther King.
You know what they all had...

512
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
What they got in common?

513
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,110
They all wear pants.

514
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,450
Every goddamned man in here wears pants!

515
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,120
How am I supposed to tell you apart from them?

516
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,370
Don't talk to her like that!

517
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,290
Sit down, Jack.

518
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,250
Sit the fuck down.

519
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,170
Mr. Van Wetter, we don't have a lot of time,
all right?

520
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,000
We got to move on.

521
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,130
Oh, you're gonna move on
one-way or another, ain't you, Ward?

522
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,590
Ward's in charge!

523
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,140
He's gonna get his way till he don't.

524
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,640
Maybe that's how he got his scars on the face.

525
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,690
You mentioned in one of your letters
to Miss Bless...

526
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,520
- that you was working
- Turn around, bitch!

527
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,690
An Uncle Tyree...

528
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,400
Yeah, yeah.

529
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,190
at the time of the murder?
What kind of work you doing?

530
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,070
Lawn work.

531
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,110
Lawn work.

532
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,950
You wear a dress in here next time
or you don't bother coming!

533
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,620
Bitch, look at me!

534
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,080
And stop bringing that fucking nigger think
he Muhammad Ali with you!

535
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,790
Mr. Van Wetter, come have a seat.

536
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,040
Cassius Clay, nigger.

537
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,960
Mr. Van Wetter, we can get a dress here
in five minutes.

538
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,960
Why don't you have a seat?

539
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,960
You got more time, Hillary.

540
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,340
Go home, boy!

541
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,560
Charlotte, where does one get pants
like that from anyway?

542
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,560
Well, I think we got the case licked.

543
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,940
Fucking circus!

544
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,320
In this town, Weldon Pine helped
get Sheriff Call re-elected.

545
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,570
Tension was brewing in the house.

546
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,910
Jack was getting all jealous of
Hillary and Charlotte.

547
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,630
And he was getting jealous of
Ward and Yardley, too.

548
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,050
Ward wasn't somebody
who attached himself to just anybody.

549
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,760
Your dad's girlfriend, what's her name?

550
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,430
Jack couldn't understand
why he was so attached to that Yardley.

551
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,180
What is the hottest temperature
that you've ever been in?

552
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,890
125...

553
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,850
How about you?

554
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,310
Just put your hand out and it burns off.

555
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,230
The hottest was when I lived in Florida.
How about you?

556
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,110
It doesn't bother me, I never pay attention to it.

557
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Cold and wet just goes, you know,

558
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:44,120
fucking through you like a knife,
but... I don't know.

559
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,290
So how's Mr. Van Wetter today?
He still innocent?

560
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,540
I don't know. If he is...

561
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,630
he sure as hell didn't have no help proving it,

562
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,880
not from that Weldon Pine guy anyway.

563
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,300
Could I have a fork or something?

564
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,970
Well, the chicken legs, you eat those
with your hands.

565
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,260
Maybe at your house.

566
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,180
Well, this is the South, sugar.

567
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,310
Anyway, you know how I feel about that.

568
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,100
Do you eat your mashed potatoes with your hands?

569
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,520
Do you really want to...? Do you really want...?
Do you really want...

570
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,020
Bring me some chopsticks, Anita.

571
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,320
Do you really want to take the shot on
putting to death a man

572
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,370
or a woman when maybe they're innocent?
I mean, I don't.

573
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,040
I don't want to try to have to live with that
on the other hand--

574
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,500
Are you gonna eat that or torture it?

575
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,130
Told you, I'm not hungry.

576
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,380
That's 'cause you're in love.

577
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,500
I know who you're sniffing around, too.

578
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,420
Anita, please don't tease him at the table.

579
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,260
On the other hand, if somebody's guilty, well,

580
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,350
you want to pay their room and board 365?

581
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,220
Absolutely.

582
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,470
Whoops!

583
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:54,020
I'm so sorry. Anyway, it's just iced tea.
It ain't even gonna stain.

584
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,190
You'd have thought Jack would have
had a girlfriend by now,

585
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,240
but all he did was jerk off to the pictures in those

586
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,700
nudie magazines that was under his bed.

587
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,410
Now she was all he could think of night and day.

588
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,250
Oh, yeah, he was definitely in love.

589
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,830
He needed her.

590
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,050
What you reading? You give it to me.
What is this shit?

591
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,710
Lolita.

592
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,680
Porno, I bet.

593
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
You need a girlfriend.

594
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,770
Look at them girls over there.

595
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,400
Go on and introduce yourself. Go on.

596
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,620
I'm just fine right here.

597
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,620
You want me to blow you, don't you?

598
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,460
You don't have to answer. I know it's true.

599
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,630
I'm not gonna blow a friendship
over a stupid little blowjob.

600
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,720
You hear me?

601
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,140
Why you talk to me like that?

602
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,770
See that one in blue? She'll blow you.

603
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,320
I don't want someone like that blowing me.

604
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,610
Well, it's a good thing you're not in prison

605
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,690
because you wouldn't have a choice there.

606
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,780
Fuck you.

607
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,210
Jack, come back here.

608
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,300
Jack.

609
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,710
Oh, my God!!

610
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,790
Pam?

611
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,550
Is he okay?

612
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,340
Is he having an allergic reaction?

613
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,050
I don't know, a jellyfish sting or something?

614
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
A jellyfish? A fucking jellyfish did that.

615
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,230
You're supposed to piss on a jellyfish sting.

616
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,730
We're gonna have to do something
a little embarrassing here.

617
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,640
You got to hang in there.

618
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,650
Hey!

619
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,650
You say you're gonna piss on him?

620
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,610
- What are you doing to him?
- Call an ambulance.

621
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,730
Lady, fuck, he's having an allergic reaction!

622
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,190
Shut the fuck up!

623
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,700
- Don't push me!
- I'm a nurse, lady...

624
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,240
Get the fuck out of here! I can see this.
I can see he's poisoned.

625
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,580
You don't pee on--

626
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,410
Don't push me!

627
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,080
I will slap your face.

628
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,330
Get the fuck out of here.

629
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,370
We'll get the fuck out of here, all right.

630
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,460
I'm going to call the police.

631
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,580
I said, I will kick your ass!

632
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,590
Move it!

633
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,290
Fine.

634
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,460
If anyone's gonna piss on him,
it's gonna be me!

635
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,340
Fine, fuck you!

636
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,800
He don't like strangers peeing on him!

637
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,380
Come on. Come on.

638
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,050
Come on, baby come on! Wake up!
Come on! Shit!

639
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,860
Come on!!

640
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,360
Shit!

641
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,790
You're gonna be okay.

642
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,380
Shit.

643
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,970
What are you doing here?

644
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,470
What do you think I'm doing here?

645
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,850
Told you to knock on my door
before you come in my room.

646
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,680
Oh, hush up.

647
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,100
Here, I brought you something. Take these pills.

648
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,650
I smell awful.

649
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,490
Well, that's because that blonde lady peed
all over your face.

650
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,660
Here, drink this.

651
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,330
Does it hurt?

652
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,330
I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm cold.

653
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,720
Congratulations, Jack. We're in the paper.

654
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,810
"Fast action saves Lately man at beach.

655
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,190
"Miss Charlotte Bless of Mobile,
Alabama apparently saved...

656
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,320
"Mr. Jansen's life by urinating over
the areas of his body

657
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,690
where he was attacked.
These included the victim's arms,

658
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,530
genitals and face."

659
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
Jack, I had no idea.

660
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,530
I had no idea that your own father would
print something like that.

661
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,950
It made the AP wire.
You're famous all over the country.

662
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,380
Home remedy. Good title.

663
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,550
What's Dad trying to do to me?

664
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,420
It's called the newspaper business, Jack.

665
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,010
Oh, shit.

666
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,020
Let him go, Jack! You're gonna kill him.

667
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,200
Jack, let him go.

668
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,250
You put your hands on me again,
I will fuck you up!

669
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,500
Yeah? Fuck you, nigger!

670
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,930
He needs to get laid.

671
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,180
He needs a fucking straitjacket is what he needs.

672
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,350
He's sexually repressed.

673
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,270
Sexually repressed is a 40-year-old woman

674
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,100
who's obsessed with prison cock!

675
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,060
That's not nice.

676
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,850
Calm down now.

677
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,270
No, fuck calm down!

678
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,570
I'm not having some prepubescent kid
call me a nigger.

679
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,610
I want him out of here now!

680
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Yardley?

681
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,210
Jack, let's go to the prison.

682
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,790
You two can stay here and keep arguing.

683
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,710
This time I'm talking to Hillary by myself.

684
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,880
Come on. He's not even gonna look at you

685
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,220
if I'm not there in a pretty dress.

686
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,260
Well, that's too bad for him.

687
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,840
Ward.

688
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,890
You'll see.

689
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,650
I knew Jack didn't mean to say it.

690
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,820
But those were the times we were living in,

691
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,860
and it was what it was.

692
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,790
Yardley on the other hand, well.

693
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,580
Forensic report says that

694
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,540
the sheriff was stabbed between 2 and 3 AM.

695
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,290
Yep. Like I told you, I was with my Uncle Tyree

696
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,330
doing lawn work in Ormond Beach at the time.

697
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,380
Lawn work?

698
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,590
Yes, sir.

699
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:39,920
You mean stealing?

700
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:40,710
Yes, sir.

701
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,840
Stealing sod off a golf course.

702
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,720
You know, a developer pay through
the teeth for that shit.

703
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,600
We sold it and we didn't even make it back
to the river till sunrise.

704
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,680
What kind of developers?

705
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,020
Condominiums, man.

706
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:51,850
You got a name?

707
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:52,730
No, I don't.

708
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,560
Deputies say they found
the sheriff's body at 6 AM,

709
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,690
but it was the way he was killed.

710
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,780
That's what makes everybody assume it was you.

711
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,070
What you think?

712
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,780
You tell me.

713
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,370
I ain't the only one carrying
a machete around here.

714
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,250
True.

715
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,960
The deputies went to Tyree's house,

716
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,590
said he'd been sleeping in bed all night

717
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,630
and had a whole bunch of family members
there to confirm it.

718
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,880
Then they go to your house,

719
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,840
where they find the bloodstained shirt and knife.

720
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,220
Yeah, all right. Listen to me.

721
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,600
Every knife and shirt that I own is stained in blood.

722
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,690
It's what I do for a living.
I'm cutting alligators for their skin.

723
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,770
Okay? I was a bachelor.
I didn't have nobody to do my laundry.

724
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,650
You probably got somebody to do your laundry.

725
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,900
What you think?

726
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,240
I bet you do.

727
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,910
They never matched the blood
to the sheriff's, did they?

728
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,830
Tell me how to find Tyree.

729
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,090
The arms of mercy are so wide
they will accept any man,

730
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,260
but they will not accept any man wearing pants.

731
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,220
Where's my woman?

732
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,100
Where's my woman?

733
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,570
The only one you need to talk
to right now is me, baby.

734
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,820
The only one I need to talk to?

735
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,530
I'm the only one. I'm your mercy.

736
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,150
I'm your arms wide open, I'm your pants.

737
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,450
Ward's in charge!

738
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,540
If you wanna go see Tyree,
I'll give you directions,

739
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,130
but you got to make that choice
because he's a violent man.

740
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:44,960
Now stay with me now
because this is when it gets tricky.

741
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,010
Ward called Charlotte and told her to

742
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,390
drive Yardley to Ormond Beach.

743
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,470
He wanted to verify Hillary's
so-called golf course story.

744
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,810
The boys went on to visit this Uncle Tyree.

745
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,860
Man, this is stupid. Where are we going?

746
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,690
No one lives out here.
No one could live out here.

747
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,200
You talk to Anita about your choice of words?

748
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,990
It was fucked up.

749
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,080
I know.

750
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,220
Goddamn it. Sure you don't want me
to watch the car?

751
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,100
Goddamn it! Stuff ain't working, man.

752
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,890
It's like they like this shit.

753
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,810
Better than jellyfish, I bet.

754
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,940
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God!

755
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:43,810
Watch it!

756
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,730
You're way too close to him.

757
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,730
- Ward! Ward!
- You better jump him.

758
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,400
It's better in here where we have to get lower.

759
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,080
Ward, you're sinking!

760
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,950
This whole place is just floating.

761
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,050
You ever think about Mama?

762
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,220
I wonder where she at.

763
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,020
She is in Tucson, Arizona.

764
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,820
You got a girlfriend?

765
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,870
Why?

766
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,840
You don't remember this,

767
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,550
but Mom used to go on about

768
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,430
don't make love to a woman
until you get married, right?

769
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,480
I followed that until I was...

770
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,310
Oh, fuck that.

771
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,480
We'll talk about it later. Let's go.

772
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,080
Mr. Van Wetter?

773
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,840
Good afternoon, sir. My name is Ward Jansen.

774
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,170
I work for "The Miami Times."

775
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,420
We're here on behalf of your nephew, Hillary.

776
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,430
You lost your shoe.

777
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,930
You're lucky it was just the one.
Snakes all around here.

778
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,190
We need to talk to you about your nephew, Mr. Van Wetter.

779
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,020
Little late for that, isn't it?

780
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,860
He gonna be strapped to a chair and electrocuted.

781
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,660
Well, you come all the way up here just to tell me that?

782
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,450
You could've saved yourself a trip.

783
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,500
He tells me that he was with you
the night Sheriff Call was murdered,

784
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,250
stealing sod, which you later sold.

785
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,670
Let's hope nobody believes him.

786
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,670
Stealing's against the law, ain't it?

787
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,470
Now he's still got time.

788
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,970
I don't much care for you.

789
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:27,100
Come up here in my home and call me a thief.

790
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,190
I ain't up here about thieving, Mr. Van Wetter.

791
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,280
I'm up here about whether a man's life
needs to be taken or not

792
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,030
for the murder of Sheriff Call.

793
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,130
But if you was with your nephew that night,

794
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,590
it's vital for Hillary that you admit it.

795
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,420
I don't think he likes you much.

796
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,720
I don't like him much either.

797
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,010
Where's the ice cream?

798
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,430
It's coming.

799
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,730
Keep that baby quiet.

800
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,270
What's wrong with that baby?

801
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,940
All right, well, sit on it.

802
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,130
You want a little ice cream?

803
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,380
You don't want to have any ice cream.

804
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,470
You take this chair out here with me.

805
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,600
No sense you staying over there.

806
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,430
Thank you.

807
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,350
Little man...

808
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,150
get yourself a chair there. Get yourself a chair.

809
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,740
Was you with him?

810
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Well...

811
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,490
I was with him.

812
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,330
Where?

813
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:20,220
Golf club. Ormond Beach. Stole sod,

814
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,640
sold it to this one condo developer.

815
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,510
Where's Hillary live from here?

816
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,810
We didn't get back till the morning, sunrise.

817
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,190
He lives that way.

818
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:36,400
So why are you telling me now?

819
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,820
You seem like the only person thinks
Hillary's innocent.

820
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,450
No, sir, Mr. Van Wetter. No, sir.

821
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,160
I didn't say that.

822
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,660
Your boy...

823
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,540
he's nervous over there.

824
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,710
- Let's go.
- I'm done talking to you.

825
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,380
- What you hiding?
- Ward.

826
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:05,130
I'm sick of your questions.

827
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,600
Eugene?

828
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,940
Ward, remember the first day
when I was with Charlotte?

829
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,400
Yeah?

830
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,360
We went and stopped at the prison.

831
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,280
We didn't go in. I saw him.

832
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,820
- Tyree?
- Yeah.

833
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,160
What you think? They was getting
their stories together?

834
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,080
I don't know.

835
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,580
I'll tell you this.
They ain't as dumb as they look.

836
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:42,300
Oh, shit, man. Fuck.

837
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,220
What the fuck, man?

838
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,850
Leave me at the fucking hotel? Jesus!

839
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,610
In Yardley's room, no less.

840
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,520
Fuck, man. Look at you.

841
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,410
You're becoming obsessed with this case.

842
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,570
Wake me up.

843
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,790
Wake me up.

844
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,330
Come on.

845
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,710
You look terrible, Ward.

846
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,920
Those mosquitoes eat you for breakfast?

847
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,670
Yardley found the golf course.

848
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,590
You found the golf course?

849
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,760
What's he doing in my clothes?

850
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,260
Car broke down...

851
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,350
we had to walk into town,
stopped by the motel to freshen up.

852
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,640
Get out of my clothes now.

853
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:44,280
Come on. Come on, Jack.

854
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:47,650
What are you doing? Come on.

855
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,280
- Miss Bless...
- Stop it.

856
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,530
Jack!

857
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,490
On the morning of the murder,

858
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,790
the grounds superintendent of the
Ormond Beach Golf Course

859
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:00,000
phoned the police department to
report that four of his greens...

860
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,580
had been stripped in the night.

861
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,340
- You talked to the superintendent?
- No.

862
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,710
He died, but I found another guy
who remembered that

863
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,180
the club called the governor to ask him to declare them

864
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:13,260
a disaster area so they could get federal
funds to replace the greens.

865
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:16,100
Gets better. I found the builder, too,

866
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,100
the guy who bought the stolen... greens.

867
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,480
He remembered Hillary and Tyree.

868
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,480
They showed up at 6 AM in a truck.

869
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,270
He took one look at them and what they had

870
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,400
and thought they'd stolen it from a cemetery.

871
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,280
But... of course, he doesn't want to
be connected to this in any way.

872
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,410
Right.

873
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:33,780
And who was he?

874
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,200
Well, the only way he'd talk to me...

875
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,250
is if I promised to keep him anonymous.

876
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,120
Come on now. What's his name?

877
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,710
No, no, no. I've got to keep it anonymous.

878
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,130
I gave him my word. He's got, well,

879
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,920
he's in a position to get some work
from the state, so you know.

880
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,590
But good, huh?

881
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:52,970
Outstanding.

882
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,770
How'd you find him?

883
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,020
Building permits.

884
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,650
Damn building permit.

885
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,610
Time to get out of Lately.

886
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,610
Did you sleep with Yardley?

887
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,910
You know, people like Yardley, you just...

888
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:26,500
got to get him on your side.
You know what I mean?

889
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,800
You fucked him for that?

890
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,470
Fucking a man is the most natural thing
in the world, Jack.

891
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:41,890
It is. It is.

892
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,320
I kind of like it out here.

893
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,870
This was a good idea.

894
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,660
Come on. Let's dance!

895
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,380
- Come on!
- No!

896
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,670
Come on, Jack. Got to have fun!

897
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,510
You wanna dance?

898
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,680
Yeah! I wanna dance with you!

899
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,070
You're good!

900
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,870
This is not me apologizing, you dig?

901
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,450
I just don't like to see you sad.

902
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,590
Yardley told their editor about the new evidence

903
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,050
from Ormond Beach.

904
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,850
This was enough to show injustice...

905
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:06,060
in the legal system of Lately and enough
for a good story.

906
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,400
Yardley wanted to get out of town
and Ward knew it.

907
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,870
All these peanuts on the floor.

908
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:24,160
Pigs. Bunch of pigs living around here.

909
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,540
Sick of this shit.

910
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,710
I can't find Mama's ring.

911
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,880
Oh, well, a nigger must have come
in the middle of the... night and stole it.

912
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:46,930
I'm sorry, Anita.

913
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:53,020
I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to say that.

914
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,480
And I'm really sorry.

915
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,910
You know, Jackie, you got to watch your mouth.

916
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,580
Somebody'll cut your little ass over
some shit like that.

917
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,160
You understand me, boy?

918
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,620
Yes, ma'am.

919
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,130
And you miss your mother?

920
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,550
Sometimes.

921
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,600
It's a dis-damn grace the way she left you.

922
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,940
And I been here.

923
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,610
Well, let's find this ring, I guess.

924
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,440
No, that's all right. I can find it

925
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,090
- Sorry.
- Oh. All right.

926
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:04,970
Ok.

927
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,010
I'm really sorry.

928
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,810
Ok. All right, Jack.

929
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,940
What's makes this story any different?

930
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,820
What makes your story different
than the others, John?

931
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,570
What makes this case so different

932
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:19,990
that you want to pull the plug now?

933
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,110
The facts. What's left to do?
You've been up there...

934
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,740
a month and a half. I want your ass back here.

935
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,530
Save that shit for someone else.

936
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,780
John, I'm not comfortable with it

937
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,290
and you shouldn't be either.

938
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,830
I'm going to Ormond Beach to get the facts.

939
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:36,250
I want to get some alligator shoes.

940
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,380
You run this article... this shit could hurt me.

941
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,510
I got advertisers to think of.

942
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,850
Advertisers? You want me to be concerned

943
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,720
with the advertisers for your newspaper?

944
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,890
Ward, you don't know everything.

945
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,060
He knows what he's doing, Pa.

946
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,520
Shut up! I'm not talking to you.

947
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:56,610
He knows how to get stories,
but what he doesn't fully appreciate...

948
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,780
is that the stories go out into a community.
They resonate.

949
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,240
Oh, like... Oh, like the jellyfish?
Like getting pissed on?

950
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,780
You notice Anita's been acting
mighty bossy recently.

951
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,870
She's always been that way.

952
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,710
Yeah.

953
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,170
Oh, shit.

954
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,380
Darling, let it go. Don't get yourself hurt.

955
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:23,010
Sit down. I'll get Anita. Anita!

956
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,180
Hey, I'll take care of it.

957
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,470
Sit down, sweetheart. Anita will get it.

958
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:26,140
Anita!

959
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,850
Does she have children? I can't remember.

960
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,060
She got two kids.

961
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,770
Oh, yeah.

962
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:39,940
How you doing, baby doll? Where you going?

963
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,860
A baby shower.

964
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:42,900
Um, Anita, uh... .

965
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,200
before you go, could you clean up this mess...

966
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,820
I said I got it. It's all right.

967
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,700
Anita's got it!

968
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:55,210
I got it. I got it.

969
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:56,580
We're going to Ormond Beach.

970
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,380
Oh, just come right out and tell them.

971
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,670
I've named Ellen editor-in-chief.

972
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,760
And...

973
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,060
we're getting married.

974
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,780
It's an antique.

975
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:27,780
I know it is. This belonged to my mother.

976
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,830
It was a gift from me. Give it back, Jack.

977
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:34,500
Just give it back to her.

978
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,500
It's all I got.

979
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,000
Ward never believed Yardley's story.

980
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,630
building permits and

981
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,040
anonymous sources.

982
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,000
He took Charlotte and Jack back to Ormond Beach

983
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:48,010
to get to the bottom of it.
Yardley went back home to Miami.

984
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,090
That man is dangerous.

985
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,810
Loving him is dangerous.

986
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,100
That man is dangerous.

987
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,320
Loving him is dangerous.

988
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,900
That man is dangerous.

989
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,240
What is that builder's name, Charlotte?

990
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:12,740
What builder?

991
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,790
You know exactly what builder.

992
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,410
The one Yardley says bought the sod.

993
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:21,290
I don't know. He went alone.
I went to the hairdresser's.

994
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,840
Takes a lot to look like this.

995
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,210
Charlotte Bless, you is a mess.

996
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,470
And you'd do anything to get your
man out of jail, wouldn't you?

997
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:38,890
Thirsty, huh?

998
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,230
Oh, yeah.

999
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,770
That man is dangerous.

1000
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:45,480
You know, you keep staring like that...

1001
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,740
we're gonna have a problem.

1002
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,860
What really happened down there, Charlotte?

1003
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,240
After you went to the hairdresser, what happened?

1004
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:56,290
Jack, would you tell your brother
to get his hands off me?

1005
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:57,540
Come on, man. Let's go somewhere else.

1006
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,120
Easy, little brother. Just fucking relax, boy.

1007
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,000
Miss Bless ain't got no answer... huh?

1008
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,170
I didn't think so.

1009
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,640
Your brother's acting strange.

1010
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,100
Not used to drinking like this.

1011
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,850
Is this love affair for real or
is it just one and done?

1012
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:19,980
I'm telling you."

1013
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,390
A little more than that.

1014
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,740
Why is Ward doing this?

1015
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:35,490
We got 50 places to be tomorrow.

1016
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,500
What is that?

1017
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,420
It's beautiful.

1018
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,760
Don't turn it down.

1019
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,350
No one's ever given me something like this before.

1020
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:05,770
Well, you just tell me when you want it back, huh?

1021
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,900
It's beautiful.

1022
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,340
You want me to fuck you, Jack?

1023
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,300
Then I'm gonna fuck you... any way you want. Jack.

1024
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:41,930
Jack!

1025
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,230
I want to get some alligator shoes.

1026
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,360
Mmm... Jack.

1027
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,320
You wanted your ass whupped.

1028
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,780
Is that what you wanted?

1029
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,320
Tell me what you want.

1030
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,950
You're a dirty pig.

1031
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,990
I'll fuck you any way you want.

1032
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,160
Little white pig.

1033
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:09,500
Jack? Jack! Jack, wake up!

1034
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,090
Something's going on in Ward's room.

1035
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,070
Hey!

1036
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,370
Hey!

1037
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,660
Stop it!

1038
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,450
What the fuck?

1039
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,120
Help!

1040
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:49,500
We need help!

1041
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,500
Where's the fucking keys?

1042
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,460
Where are the fucking keys?

1043
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,330
Motherfucker, wake up!

1044
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,300
Help!

1045
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:40,090
Where are the fucking keys?

1046
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,260
Ward, what's the plastic for?

1047
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,390
What is the plastic?

1048
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,060
What the fuck?

1049
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:16,460
I've watched you so often. You sit here,

1050
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,800
and I heard that you play a little drums.

1051
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,340
You didn't get up and do anything.

1052
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:25,470
I heard you could sing,
but with me you are going to sing.

1053
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,390
He's gonna be fine.

1054
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,810
You don't have to sleep all the way down there.

1055
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,630
All right.

1056
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,380
Just this once.

1057
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:56,060
I can't fuck with this TV on.

1058
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:03,240
Feels kind of awkward to be talking
while you see this...

1059
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,740
But it's kind of awkward that
they're doing it in the first place.

1060
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,210
Most boys Jack's age fall
in love with their high school

1061
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,130
or college sweetheart,

1062
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,840
but Jack never bothered much
with girls after his mama left.

1063
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:35,520
I guess you could say he had abandonment issues.

1064
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,650
With Charlotte,
it was like he was getting his mama,

1065
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,480
his high school sweetheart,

1066
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:44,280
and a oversexed Barbie doll all rolled into one.

1067
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:53,120
Anywho, I think y'all seen enough.

1068
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,710
My hair looks like crap. Don't even look at it.

1069
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,630
Shit. I got to go to the hairdresser.

1070
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:04,840
My wig ain't acting right.

1071
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,430
I don't understand
what the fuck you're doing with Hillary.

1072
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,390
Here we go.

1073
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:18,480
You don't love him.

1074
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,520
Really? You don't know that.

1075
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:28,570
You don't know anything. You're 20 years old.

1076
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,320
You're not that much older.

1077
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,780
I'm a lot older.

1078
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,700
It ain't gonna happen. Look at me.

1079
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,460
It's not practical.

1080
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,500
I'm not as practical as the murderer?

1081
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,790
He's not guilty, Jack. That's the point.

1082
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,670
That's not the point.

1083
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,170
Fuck this. I knew it would happen.

1084
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:46,710
What?

1085
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,920
I give you some ass and suddenly...

1086
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,850
Look... Hillary ain't so bad.

1087
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,560
and I'm not so good. I've got another side.

1088
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,310
I got a fucked-up side,
and it gets along just fine with my man.

1089
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,020
You can't split yourself into sides.

1090
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,150
Sure, you can. Just ask your brother.

1091
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,570
What the fuck does Ward have to do with this?

1092
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,530
He has a dark side
and I don't mean him being a fag.

1093
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,370
Now these boys lived for each other.

1094
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:20,870
Jack wasn't hurt by Ward being a homosexual

1095
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,670
or the dark stuff that he was into.

1096
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:27,210
He was just hurt that Ward never told him.

1097
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:32,930
Hi.

1098
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:34,470
Hey, there.

1099
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,720
He's doing better. He's gonna be all right.

1100
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:38,600
Good.

1101
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,390
So I got to go.

1102
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,690
Go where? Where you going?

1103
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,520
I'm going back home.

1104
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,650
You don't have to go anywhere.

1105
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,570
It's just the way it works.

1106
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,660
You shouldn't go anywhere you don't want to go.

1107
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,750
Who says I don't want to go?

1108
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:06,540
Why do you have to go?

1109
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,920
'Cause I do.

1110
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,590
Take this ring back.

1111
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:16,050
Yardley called the hotel.

1112
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,390
Did you tell him?

1113
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,430
I told him...

1114
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,640
Ward got mugged and beaten on the beach.

1115
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,270
Well, what'd he say?

1116
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,650
Not much.

1117
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,900
Wanted to know if he was gonna make it.

1118
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,490
When I told him it wasn't serious,
he kind of just lost interest.

1119
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:34,570
Well, he's not gonna be much help for a while.

1120
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,910
Didn't sound like he needed much help.

1121
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,700
He can't go write the story alone, Charlotte.

1122
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,620
Well, we just have to see.

1123
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:43,870
He doesn't know enough about it.

1124
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,170
This isn't about a newspaper article, Jack.

1125
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:47,380
It's about a person's life.

1126
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,130
That's the whole point we're here, okay?

1127
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,460
So it's about someone's life.

1128
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,340
Baby, don't go.

1129
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:58,970
You're starting to screw with my head.

1130
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,730
Look, you're a good kid, all right?

1131
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,020
You got your whole life ahead of you,
and you want me?

1132
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,660
Jack went down to "The Miami Times" to try...

1133
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:21,660
to stop Yardley from publishing the article.

1134
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,870
He didn't want his brother's name on it.

1135
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,460
Jack.

1136
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,420
Hi.

1137
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,510
How's Ward?

1138
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:35,800
How's your brother doing?

1139
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:37,510
Been trying to get ahold of you since yesterday.

1140
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,930
Good. He's obviously not doing so badly then.

1141
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:44,020
Sorry, I uh... didn't want any distractions.
Come, sit, sit.

1142
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,020
He wants to read what you're writing.

1143
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,400
Well, as soon as I'm done,

1144
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,980
he'll be the first to read it, as always.

1145
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,360
Damn it! I'm so sick of your shit, man!

1146
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,030
His name is on that, too.

1147
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,610
He wants to read it before it's published.

1148
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,910
That's it. He just wants to
read it before it's published.

1149
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,040
You got to get those facts straight.

1150
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,540
You got to get all the facts straight.

1151
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,620
You're starting to sound like your brother.

1152
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,840
Look, we have a deadline here.

1153
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,710
I've told you, this is the newspaper business.

1154
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,550
We don't have time to get all the facts.

1155
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,380
We both know the town of Lately set Hillary up.

1156
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,510
We've got the story.

1157
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,930
It's not the fucking truth!

1158
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,390
You want to talk about the motherfucking truth?

1159
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,730
You thought I was from London?

1160
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,730
Ain't no Negro getting a job up
in this spot unless he's a colored...

1161
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,150
motherfucking James Bond, you dig?

1162
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:42,450
I got drunk once and let Ward suck my dick.

1163
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,540
He got a taste for niggers
and now he hates himself.

1164
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,080
That's the truth.

1165
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:52,630
Go back to your brother, boy.

1166
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,760
I have got a deadline to meet.

1167
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,130
Hello?

1168
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:38,760
Put Ward on the phone.

1169
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,970
Why would you put his byline on that article?

1170
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,100
How could you sign his name on that?

1171
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,850
Tell him we got Hillary out.

1172
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,810
The governor's gonna pardon him.

1173
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,850
Hillary's getting out.

1174
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:58,860
I've had some time to think over

1175
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,740
the past few months about me, about you.

1176
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,950
Not sure I found what I want out of life yet.

1177
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:09,120
All I know is that I don't want
to live it without you.

1178
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,790
Please take this ring back. Love, Jack."

1179
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,170
Get the door.

1180
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:29,010
Get the fucking door, bitch!

1181
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,160
Who the fuck are you?

1182
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:45,860
I'm Hillary.

1183
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:48,120
Get the fuck out! I'm with Charlotte.

1184
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,660
I'll call you later!

1185
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,880
Charlotte, you want me to call the police?

1186
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,050
There she is.

1187
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:11,140
I'm sorry.

1188
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,600
See, I was gonna write you
a letter and I was gonna--

1189
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:15,770
No, I don't need your letters. Come here.

1190
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:35,910
Come on here. Don't touch you?

1191
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,080
It's okay.

1192
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,750
It's all right, baby.

1193
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,810
You want to do something for me?

1194
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,690
Anything.

1195
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,030
That's all right.

1196
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,760
You told me you loved me in your third letter.

1197
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,970
Do you love me?

1198
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,430
Yes!

1199
01:19:56,450 --> 01:20:01,170
You always fuck like this? Like it was the last time?

1200
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,340
Do you think I'm pretty?

1201
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:12,140
You fuck those niggers like this?

1202
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,770
Gonna get all inside here!

1203
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,440
Now pack your shit and let's go.

1204
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,870
I don't think I'm gonna like living in a swamp.

1205
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:41,750
I don't want to live in a swamp.
I like it here. I like it here.

1206
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:46,920
And that was their declaration of love.

1207
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,920
So Hillary took Charlotte to the swamp.

1208
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:05,480
So did you hear about old man Henry?

1209
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,980
Yeah, they said the other night he got drunk

1210
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:10,070
in his back yard by the water,

1211
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:12,860
and the alligators came out
and took a big chunk of his leg.

1212
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,070
Just joking.

1213
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:21,040
My daddy rooster, he got jumped by three of his sons,

1214
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,830
so I need to find a home for three of them.

1215
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:26,960
So he's in my house sitting, so I need...

1216
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:28,880
I know you only have hens.

1217
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,260
That's why I was wondering, you know...
if you want to babysit...

1218
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,220
you know, adopt three of them for you.

1219
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:36,220
But they'd be good, though, because you have hens.

1220
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,550
- You're my only hope.
- No.

1221
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,010
No! I don't want any.

1222
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,640
Come on, Charlotte.

1223
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:43,270
I need you to do me a favor.

1224
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,810
I need you to post this thing for me.
It ain't got a stamp on it.

1225
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,020
What's wrong with you today?

1226
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:50,270
It's just real important.
You think you can do that for me?

1227
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,820
You're not acting yourself today.

1228
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,790
Why's your door open, huh?

1229
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:02,830
Hey, Jack.

1230
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,540
Smells like piss in here.

1231
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,210
Ward Ward said you might show up.

1232
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:13,300
Left him a note. You stink.
I can smell you from over here.

1233
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:16,260
Come here, boy. Come sit down.

1234
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,890
What you doing back in Miami?

1235
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,520
Yardley's gone.

1236
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,440
Quit?

1237
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:28,190
No.

1238
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:36,400
He's in New York. Signing some book deal.

1239
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,490
Hero of the new journalism
or some kind of shit. I don't know.

1240
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,040
W.W. moved Ellen into the house, huh?

1241
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Whatever.

1242
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,630
Whatever makes him happy.

1243
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,360
There wasn't no developer, Jack.

1244
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:31,540
All right, let's move. Come on, go shower, Ward.

1245
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,290
I'm tired.

1246
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,670
Come on.

1247
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,970
Jeez!

1248
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,940
I keep thinking I missed something, Jack.

1249
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:04,910
Like I missed something I was supposed
to see that was right in front of me.

1250
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,080
Like what?

1251
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,210
The point of it.

1252
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,710
Doesn't matter.

1253
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:19,590
Things got out of hand. You got hurt,

1254
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:23,010
Yardley got his fucking book deal.

1255
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,970
Hillary got Charlotte in the swamp.

1256
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:32,400
The idea is that...

1257
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,570
you run the water while you're in there with it.

1258
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:37,940
Come on, man.

1259
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,710
What if we didn't get it right, huh?

1260
01:24:58,210 --> 01:24:59,170
Makes no difference.

1261
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,420
It makes no difference, Jack?

1262
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:04,090
You don't know what it feels like
to get it exactly right now.

1263
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,760
to get it down just the way it happened.

1264
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,850
You're going back to see Hillary.

1265
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,440
Fuck yeah, I am.

1266
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,190
Do you ever hear from her?

1267
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,150
No.

1268
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,150
- Miss Bless?
- No.

1269
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:21,190
I wonder... what she thinks of him now, huh?

1270
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,280
Can't see her sitting on the porch stoop
holding a silver spoon

1271
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:29,490
and waiting for the ice cream carton
to come her way, can you?

1272
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,250
I dug around.

1273
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,290
There wasn't no proof, no how,

1274
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:39,550
nowhere that they was ever
stealing sod that night.

1275
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:43,090
They want me to keep my mouth shut.

1276
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:47,470
Don't want me to tell my story. Well, fuck them.

1277
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,640
I'm gonna tell my story.

1278
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:52,270
I'm gonna write my story, and they can publish it

1279
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:54,190
wherever the fuck they want to.

1280
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:04,490
Yeah, Mama always said you better be right

1281
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,660
and be last before you gonna be
first and be wrong, boy.

1282
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,000
Be right and be last before
you go gonna be first and be wrong--

1283
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,460
Yeah, I know!

1284
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:42,530
I heard-- They said things about...

1285
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:44,780
Oh, yeah. It's all true.

1286
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,700
Just kidding. You should see the other guy.

1287
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,780
Smile.

1288
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,240
Smile.

1289
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:52,240
Thank you.

1290
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,830
Everyone, please. We're cutting the cake!

1291
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,550
Where's the photographer?

1292
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,760
Hey, Claire, can you hand me that
salt over there? Thank you.

1293
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:12,390
Hi.

1294
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,350
Hi. You ain't supposed to be in here.
You gonna get me in--

1295
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,770
I got you a drink.

1296
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,650
You know W.W. fired me.

1297
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,570
I'm gonna talk to your boss...

1298
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:28,950
and tell him you're a friend of the family.

1299
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:30,030
No, Jack.

1300
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:30,570
Yeah.

1301
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,950
All I ever did was cook and clean for you boys.

1302
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:38,460
I wasn't never no family.
Anyway, go on back outside.

1303
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:42,670
Well, Ward's out there.
You gonna come see him?

1304
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,300
Are you trying to get me fired?

1305
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,510
I miss you.

1306
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,470
I got something for you. Wait a minute.

1307
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,820
This came for you about a month ago.
She told him to tell--

1308
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,200
She told him not to let you see it.

1309
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:15,660
"Dear Jack, I can't believe I'm finally writing you this letter

1310
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,580
or if it will get to you...

1311
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:19,660
or whether you'll even read it.

1312
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:23,710
Jack, I think I've really messed up this time.

1313
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:27,630
Don't is understand me. Hillary
loves me in his way.

1314
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,840
It's just me that isn't made for this place,
for this lifestyle.

1315
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:35,510
I hope I can make it to your father's wedding

1316
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,890
so I can hear you tell me, 'l told you so.'

1317
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:45,980
Take care for now. Sweetly, your Charlotte."

1318
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:51,240
Is that from blondie?

1319
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,540
Thank you.

1320
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:03,540
Where's your hat?

1321
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:04,710
Oh, I forgot.

1322
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,790
Get out of the kitchen.

1323
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,590
I'm sorry.

1324
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:07,380
Excuse me.

1325
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,090
I'm Jack Jansen. I'm the groom's son.

1326
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,380
My father wants to know what exactly...

1327
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:11,420
is taking dinner so long.

1328
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:12,720
It'll be ready in a minute, sir.

1329
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,800
Thank you.

1330
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:16,720
Put the hair under the hat.

1331
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:19,520
I don't want your black hair in my food.

1332
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,560
You can put your black hair in my food.

1333
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:31,740
Cheers.

1334
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:38,580
Bye, Anita.

1335
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,630
Bye, Jack.

1336
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:10,400
You wouldn't leave without me, would you?

1337
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,190
Drop you off at the motel.

1338
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:13,570
I'm going somewhere.

1339
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,950
Mind me asking where you're going afterwards?

1340
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:17,620
Going to Charlotte's.

1341
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:18,660
Well, it gotta be tonight?

1342
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,160
I got to get her the fuck out of there.

1343
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:21,580
I got to get her out of there, Ward!

1344
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,620
Charlotte's acting on her own free will.

1345
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:23,620
What do you want me to say, man.

1346
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:24,750
What do you want me to say, man? Move.

1347
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:26,370
I got to go to the Van Wetters' anyway.

1348
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:28,210
Come with me tomorrow morning. We go first thing.

1349
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:29,170
Fuck that. We're going now.

1350
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,630
Jack, It ain't... the right time to do this.

1351
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,710
- Get the fuck out my way.
- You ain't driving drunk like this.

1352
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,880
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, huh?

1353
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:37,970
What?

1354
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,810
Charlotte must be a good piece of ass.

1355
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,440
You look like a pirate.

1356
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:51,320
I know.

1357
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:54,360
Do this for me one time. Go "Aargh."

1358
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,820
Hey, you're driving all squirrelly, man.

1359
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:02,910
Hey, Jack, sit on down. Hey.

1360
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,040
You sure it's this way?

1361
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:13,090
I'm sure it's this way.

1362
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:18,090
Ain't a good time to be drinking
too much out here, Jack.

1363
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:23,760
Yeah, you're one to talk. Keeping
your promise to Dad, did you?

1364
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:27,520
Not to drink on his big day?
How you holding up?

1365
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:31,520
Let's see your hands. Are they shaking?

1366
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:33,940
They shaking, Ward, huh?

1367
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,150
Don't drink.

1368
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:39,530
Well, why do you take after the worst of me, Jack?

1369
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:43,160
'Cause you're my brother.

1370
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,170
Wedding party, Charlotte?

1371
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,630
I'm going to the wedding.

1372
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,670
Don't be difficult. I told you...

1373
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:58,010
I don't want you to go.

1374
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:00,590
No. I told you. I'm going to the wedding.

1375
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:06,390
Watch out. God, it smells like shit.

1376
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,690
Electric fence. You all right?

1377
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:17,400
Goddamn.

1378
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:29,080
You let me lead.

1379
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,020
I don't want to quarrel with you, you know.
You're my little pony.

1380
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,940
I just want to climb up on you one more time.

1381
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:08,790
I can't believe she'd live here.

1382
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:20,800
Charlotte?

1383
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:51,660
Charlotte?

1384
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,260
Charlotte!

1385
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,970
What you want?

1386
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:21,070
She not here! She gone!

1387
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:23,780
What is it you want with my wife?

1388
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,290
What is it you want with my wife?

1389
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:37,920
Just wanted to say hello.

1390
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,880
A quick hello and a quick poke while you're at it?

1391
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,210
How about you? What you up to, Ward?

1392
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:53,220
I know what you came for. I got what you want.

1393
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,270
Where is she?

1394
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:56,640
How should I know?

1395
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,060
I'm not leaving until I see her.

1396
01:34:58,230 --> 01:34:59,980
She not here. She gone.

1397
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,020
- Let's go.
- Where?

1398
01:35:02,190 --> 01:35:03,070
How should I know?

1399
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,610
Last night she told me she was going to
your father's wedding!

1400
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:08,530
You're a liar! We just come from there!

1401
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:10,490
And that's where you should go back to, boy!

1402
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,870
He's lying. He's lying.

1403
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,750
I got this. Go back to the boat.

1404
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:18,210
Where is she? Where is she?

1405
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:19,420
Stop provoking me, boy,

1406
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,750
and do what your brother tells you!

1407
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,090
I said I'm not leaving until I see her!

1408
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:27,340
Goddamn it, he killed her.

1409
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,220
He killed her, Ward.

1410
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:31,720
You killed her!

1411
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:36,890
You son of a bitch!
That's all you we're good for is killing her!

1412
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,350
Run, Jack!

1413
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,820
Come on, boy. Show me.

1414
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,150
I'm gonna fuck you up.

1415
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,280
Come on!

1416
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:48,650
Jack!

1417
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,820
Ward!

1418
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,660
Is this what you wanted?

1419
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,080
Yeah.

1420
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:05,420
You got what you come for.

1421
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,220
Paperboy.

1422
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,220
Where you going, paperboy?

1423
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:14,680
Ain't no way out of this one.

1424
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,150
Fuck you!

1425
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:48,870
Hillary Van Wetter was tried
and convicted in the murders

1426
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,370
of Charlotte Bless and Ward Jansen.

1427
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:06,600
He died in the electric chair
at the Florida State Prison.

1428
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:11,100
Nobody ever found out who murdered Sheriff Call.

1429
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:30,450
My little Jack finally saw his mama again
at Ward's funeral.

1430
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:34,420
He became a writer of some renown.

1431
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:42,420
He never did get over his first true love.
