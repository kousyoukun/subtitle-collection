541 541

I'm gonna ask him
about some things he wrote,

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,832
some letters to Charlotte.

543 543

H ere we go.

544 544
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:41,774
Hold.

545 545
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:45,878
Good morning,早上好！
Mr. Van Wetter.

546 546
00:31:50,684 --> 00:31:51,951
Hey.嘿。

547 547
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:56,156
Where's your dress?

548 548
00:31:56,223 --> 00:31:58,326
You don't like me
like this?这样的吗？

549 549
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:00,961
You know a prisoner
by the name of--

550 550
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:02,529
Ward, Ward, Ward.

551 551
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:04,198
You know a prisoner
by the name

552 552
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:06,700
of Mr. Bobby Valentine?
Mr. Van Wetter?

553 553
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:09,370
Mr. Demarcus Williams,
Mr. Bobby Hinton?

554 554
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:11,839
Another prisoner另一名犯人
by the name of Jimmy Edwards,

555 555
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:14,075
another one, Demarcus.

556 556
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,210
I think his name is Curt.
I forgot his last name.

557 557
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:18,447
Anyway, you know what
they all have in common?

558 558
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:21,148
Hey, Martin Luther King.

559 559
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:23,185
You know what they all had
in common?共通之处？ What?什么？

560 560
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:25,786
They all wear pants.

561 561
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,990
Every goddamned man
in here wears pants!

562 562
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:30,025
How am I supposed to tell
you apart from them?

563 563
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:31,793
Don't talk to her like that!
Sit down, Jack.

564 564
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,729
Sit the fuck down.坐的我坐下。

565 565
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:35,998
Mr. Van Wetter, we don't have
a lot of time, all right?

566 566
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:37,833
We got to move on.

567 567
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,402
You're gonna move
on one way or another, Ward?

568 568
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,638
Ward's in charge!

569 569
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:46,308
He's gonna get his way--
till he don't.

570 570
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,178
Maybe that's how he got
his scars on the face.

571 571
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:55,151
You mentioned in one
of your letters to Miss Bless

572 572
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:57,720
that you was working
Turn around, bitch!

573 573
00:32:57,788 --> 00:33:00,023
An Uncle Tyree--
Yeah, yeah.是啊，是啊。

574 574
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:01,691
at the time在时间
of the murder.

575 575
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:02,760
What kind of work you doing?
Lawn work.

576 576
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:04,461
Lawn work.

577 577
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:06,362
You wear a dress
in here next time

578 578
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:09,066
or you don't bother coming!
Bitch, look at me!

579 579
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:14,905
And stop bringing
that fucking nigger

580 580
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,774
think he
Muhammad Ali with you!

581 581
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,376
Mr. Van Wetter,
come have a seat.

582 582
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:20,611
Cassius Clay, nigger.

583 583
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:22,313
We can get a dress
here in five minutes.

584 584
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,582
Why don't you你为什么不
have a seat?

585 585
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:24,616
Go home, boy!

586 586
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,422
I don't know--我不知道 - 

587 587
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:34,526
Charlotte, where does one get
pants like that from anyway?

588 588
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:37,562
Well, I think we got
the case licked.

589 589
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,198
This is这是
a fucking circus!

590 590
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:46,538
In this town,

591 591
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,574
Weldon Pine helped get
Sheriff Call re-elected.

592 592
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,743
Tension was brewing
in the house.在房子里。

593 593
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,946
Jack was getting jealous of
Hillary and Charlotte.

594 594
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:59,685
And he was getting jealous
of Ward and Yardley, too.

595 595
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:05,392
Ward wasn't somebody who
attached himself to just anybody.

596 596
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:07,861
Your dad's girlfriend,
what's her name?她叫什么名字？

597 597
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:10,764
Jack couldn't understand why he
was so attached to that Yardley.

598 598
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:13,166
No, you didn't.

599 599
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:14,935
What is the hottest
temperature温度

600 600
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,403
that you've ever been in?

601 601
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,939
125. 125。

602 602
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,806
How about you?你怎么样？

603 603
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:21,942
Just put your hand out
and it burns off

604 604
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,178
The hottest was when I lived
in Florida. How about you?你怎么样？

605 605
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,847
It doesn't bother me.它不打扰我。
I never pay attention to it.

606 606
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:30,652
Cold and wet just goes
fucking through you like a knife

607 607
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,721
but--I don't know.

608 608
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:37,993
So how's Mr. Van Wetter today?
He still innocent?

609 609
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,528
I don't know.我不知道。
If he is--

610 610
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:43,799
he sure as hell didn't have no help
proving it,

611 611
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,734
not from that
Weldon Pine guy anyway.

612 612
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:48,370
Could I have a fork
or something?还是什么？

613 613
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:51,373
The chicken legs, you eat those
with your hands.

614 614
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,176
Maybe at your house.

615 615
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:55,144
This is这是
the South, sugar.

616 616
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:57,614
Anyway, you know
how I feel about that.

617 617
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,816
Do you eat your mashed potatoes with
your hands? Do you really want to--?

618 618
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:04,621
Do you really want to--?
Bring me some chopsticks, Anita.

619 619
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,123
Do you really want
to take the shot--

620 620
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,659
on putting to death
a man or a woman一个男人或一个女人

621 621
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:13,830
when maybe they're innocent?
I mean, I don't.

622 622
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:17,468
I don't want to try to have
to live with that.

623 623
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:21,371
On the other hand-- Are you gonna
eat that or torture it?

624 624
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,874
Told you,
I'm not hungry.

625 625
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,209
That's'cause
you're in love.

626 626
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:27,278
I know who you're
sniffing around, too.

627 627
00:35:27,345 --> 00:35:29,080
Anita, please don't tease him
at the table.在餐桌上。

628 628
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,015
On the other hand,另一方面，
if somebody's guilty,

629 629
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:35,019
well, you want to pay
their room and board 365?

630 630
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:35,953
Absolutely.当然可以。
Ah! “啊！

631 631
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,589
Whoops.哎呀。

632 632
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:40,259
I'm so sorry.我很抱歉。

633 633
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:43,161
Anyway, it's just iced tea.
It ain't even gonna stain.

634 634
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:48,767
You'da thought Jack woulda
had a girlfriend by now,

635 635
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,769
but all he did was jerk
off to the pictures

636 636
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:54,373
in those nudie magazines
that was under his bed.

637 637
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:58,144
Now she was all he could think
of night and day.

638 638
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:00,380
Oh, yeah, he was
definitely in love.

639 639
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:04,817
He needed her.他需要她。

640 640
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:07,221
What you reading?
You give it to me.

641 641
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:10,423
What is this shit?
" Lolita."

642 642
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,426
Porno, I bet.

643 643
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:17,731
Oh.哦。

644 644
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,269
You need a girlfriend.

645 645
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:28,976
Look at them girls
over there.那边。

646 646
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:32,280
Go on and introduce yourself.
Go on.去吧。

647 647
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:36,885
I'm just fine我就好了
right here.

648 648
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,059
You want me to blow you,
don't you?不是吗？

649 649
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,561
You don't have to answer.你没有回答。
I know it's true.

650 650
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:52,835
I'm not gonna blow
a friendship--

651 651
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,270
over a stupid
little blowjob.

652 652
00:36:58,274 --> 00:36:59,275
You hear me?

653 653
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,612
Look, why you talking
to me like that?

654 654
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:06,650
See that one in blue?
She'll blow you.

655 655
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:08,851
I don't want someone like
that blowing me.

656 656
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:11,153
It's a good thing
you're not in prison

657 657
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,023
because you wouldn't have
a choice there.

658 658
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,763
Fuck you.你他妈的。

659 659
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:28,205
Jack, come back here.

660 660
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:31,509
# Well, well #

661 661
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:37,181
# I passed the corner
Where we first met #

662 662
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:39,317
# Yes, I did #

663 663
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:43,621
# Memories of our love
Linger there yet #

664 664
00:37:45,523 --> 00:37:48,893
# Oh, I'm sitting
On top of the world #

665 665
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,566
# Just to know
That you're my girl #

666 666
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:57,303

Is he okay?他还好吗？

677 677

Is he having
an allergic reaction?

678 678
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:04,640
A jellyfish sting
or something?还是什么？

679 679

A fucking jellyfish

680 680
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,311
You're supposed to piss
on a jellyfish sting.

681 681
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,312
We're gonna have to do

00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:19,289
He's having a reaction!
Shut the fuck up!闭嘴！

Don't push me!

00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:22,788
What are you doing here?你在这里做什么？

713 713
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:25,324
What do you think你怎么看
I'm doing here?

714 714
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,328
Told you to knock

00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:29,396
before you come
in my room.在我的房间里。

Oh, hush up.

717 717
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:34,134
Here, I brought
you something.

718 718
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,637
Take these pills.

719 719
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,871
I smell awful.

720 720
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,675
That's because that blond
lady peed all over your face.

721 721
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:46,314
Ugh.唉。 Here,在这里，
drink this.

722 722
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:47,749
Does it hurt?会不会痛？

723 723
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,688
I'm cold, I'm cold,
I'm cold.

724 724
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:08,837
Congratulations, Jack.
We're in the paper.

"Fast action saves

where he was attacked.

These included the victim's arms,
genitals and face. " “

731 731
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,489
Jack, I had no idea.

732 732
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:27,924
I had no idea我不知道
that your own father

733 733
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:29,392
would print
something like that.类似的东西。

734 734
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:31,027
It made the AP wire.

You're famous
all over the country.全国各地。

"Home Remedy."
Good title.

737 737
00:41:39,135 --> 00:41:42,273
What's Dad trying
to do to me?

738 738
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,309
It's called the newspaper
business, Jack.

739 739
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:50,414
Oh, shit.哦，该死。

740 740
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:55,921
Let him go, Jack!
You're gonna kill him.

741 741
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:07,633
Jack, let him go.

742 742
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:16,342
You put your hands
on me again,

743 743
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,843
I will fuck you up!
Yeah?是吗？

744 744
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:20,079
Fuck you, nigger!

745 745
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:28,655
He needs to get laid.

746 746
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:31,057
He needs
a fucking straitjacket.

747 747
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:32,725
He's sexually repressed.

748 748
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,561
Sexually repressed
is a 40-year-old woman

749 749
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,530
who's obsessed
with prison cock!

750 750
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,465
That's not nice.这不是很好。
Calm down now.

751 751
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:41,201
No, fuck calm down!

I want him我想他
out of here now!

754 754
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:49,009
Yardley?

755 755
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:58,652
Jack, let's go杰克，让我们去
to the prison.

756 756
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,488
You two can stay here
and keep arguing.

757 757
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:02,324
This time I'm talking
to Hillary by myself.

758 758
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,892
Come on.来吧。

759 759
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,627
He's not even
gonna look at you

760 760
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:07,696
if I'm not there
in a pretty dress.

761 761
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:09,732
Well, that's too bad
for him.他。

762 762
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:11,333
Ward.

763 763
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:15,871
You'll see.你会看到的。

764 764
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:27,416
I knew Jack
didn't mean to say it.

765 765
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,586
But those were the times
we were living in

766 766
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:31,187
and it was
what it was.

767 767
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:35,926
Yardley, on the other
hand, well--

768 768
00:43:40,597 --> 00:43:44,034
# Get out of the cold #

769 769
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:47,838
# Take the night off #

770 770
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:51,842
# Be your own boss #

771 771

# When you're near me #

772 772
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,115
# Can you hear me #

773 773
00:43:57,181 --> 00:44:01,286
# Or do I have to shout
In your ear #

774 774
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:02,654
# Mmm #

775 775
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,957
# Take the night off #

776 776
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:09,728
# Turn the light on #

777 777
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:12,230
# Take the night off #

# Turn the light on #

779 779
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:17,636
Forensic report says
that the sheriff

780 780
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:20,205
was stabbed
between 2 and 3 AM.

781 781
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:22,041
Yep.是的。 Like I told you,

782 782
00:44:22,107 --> 00:44:24,311
I was with-- my Uncle Tyree
doing lawn work

783 783
00:44:24,377 --> 00:44:25,978
in Ormond Beach
at the time.的时间。

784 784
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:28,247
Lawn work?
Yes, sir.是的，先生。

785 785
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:30,150
You mean stealing?
Yes, sir.是的，先生。

786 786
00:44:30,216 --> 00:44:32,217
Stealing sod
off a golf course.

787 787
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:35,422
A developer paid through
the teeth for that shit.

788 788
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:36,923
We sold it and we didn't
make it back

789 789
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,691
to the river
till sunrise.

790 790
00:44:38,757 --> 00:44:40,660
What kind of developers?
Condominiums, man.

791 791
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:42,829
You got a name?你有名字吗？
No, I don't.不，我不知道。

792 792
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:45,932
Deputies say they found
the sheriff's body at 6 AM--

793 793
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:48,068
but it was the way
he was killed.

794 794
00:44:51,172 --> 00:44:53,173
That's what makes everybody
assume it was you.

795 795
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,177
What you think?你觉得呢？
You tell me.你告诉我。

796 796
00:44:56,244 --> 00:44:58,845
I ain't the only one carrying
a machete around here.

797 797
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:02,650
True.为True。

798 798
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:05,920
The deputies
went to Tyree's house,

799 799
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:08,055
he said he'd been sleeping
in bed all night

800 800
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,692
and had a whole bunch of family
members there to confirm it.

801 801
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:13,761
Then they go
to your house--

802 802
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:16,365
where they find the bloodstained shirt
and knife.

803 803
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:18,799
Yeah, all right.
Listen to me.听我说。

804 804
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,970
Every knife and shirt that
I own is stained in blood.

805 805
00:45:22,037 --> 00:45:23,572
It's what I do这是我做什么
for a living.

806 806
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,974
I'm gutting alligators
for their skin.

807 807
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,809
Okay?可以吗？
I was a bachelor.

808 808
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:30,914
I didn't have nobody
to do my laundry.

809 809
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,881
You probably got somebody
to do your laundry.

810 810
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:33,983
What you think?你觉得呢？

811 811
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:36,653
I bet you do.我敢打赌，你怎么做。

812 812
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:42,225
They never matched the blood
to the sheriff's, did they?

813 813
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:44,028
Tell me how to find Tyree.

814 814
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,835
The arms of mercy
are so wide

815 815
00:45:52,902 --> 00:45:55,573
they will accept any man,

816 816
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:59,476
but they will not accept
any man wearing pants.

817 817
00:45:59,543 --> 00:46:02,846
Where is my woman?

818 818
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,351
Where's my woman?

819 819
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:11,022
The only one you need只有一个你需要的
to talk to right now is me, baby.

820 820
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:12,523
The only one
I need to talk to?

821 821
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,159
I'm the only one.
I'm your mercy.

822 822
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,261
I'm your arms wide open,
I'm your pants.

823 823
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,498
Ward's in charge!

824 824
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:27,239
If you wanna go see Tyree,
I'll give you directions,

825 825
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:30,776
but you got to make that choice
because he's a violent man.

826 826
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:32,544
Now stay with me now

827 827
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:34,513
because this is
when it gets tricky.

828 828
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,782
Ward called Charlotte

829 829
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:41,687
and told her to drive Yardley
to Ormond Beach.

830 830
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:45,958
He wanted to verify Hillary's
so-called golf course story.

831 831
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:49,062
The boys went on to visit
this Uncle Tyree.

832 832
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:51,732
Man, this is stupid.
Where are we going?我们要去哪里？

833 833
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:54,001
No one lives out here.
No one could live out here.

834 834
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:58,640
You talk to Anita about your--choice
of words?

835 835
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:02,476
It was fucked up.它搞砸了。

836 836
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:05,979
I know.我知道。

837 837
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:18,928
Goddamn it.该死的。

838 838
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:20,428
Sure you don't me
to watch the car?

839 839
00:47:22,263 --> 00:47:25,668
Goddamn it! This stuff
ain't working, man.

840 840
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:27,669
It's like they
like this shit.

841 841
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,171
Better than jellyfish,
I bet.我敢打赌。

842 842
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:32,974
Fuck!他妈的！
Oh, my God!哦，我的上帝！

843 843
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,077
Watch it!当心！ You're way too
close to him. Ward! Ward!

844 844
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:38,047
You better jump him.

845 845
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:40,182
It's better in here
where we have to get lower.

846 846
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,622
Ward, you're sinking!

847 847
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,325
This whole place
is just floating.

848 848
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,537
You ever think
about Mama?

849 849
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,713
I wonder我不知道
where she at.

850 850
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:15,786
She is in Tucson, Arizona.

851 851
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:23,328
You got a girlfriend?

852 852
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:31,336
Why?为什么呢？

853 853
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:43,750
You don't remember this, but
Mom used to go on about, uh--

854 854
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:47,252
don't make love to a woman until
you get married, right? Mm-hm.嗯。

855 855
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:53,093
I followed that
until I was--

856 856
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,766
Oh, fuck that. We'll talk我们将讨论
about it later.

857 857
00:48:58,832 --> 00:48:59,934
Let's go.让我们去。

858 858
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,345
Mr. Van Wetter?

859 859
00:49:15,382 --> 00:49:17,351
Good afternoon, sir.

860 860
00:49:17,418 --> 00:49:19,688
My name is Ward Jansen.
I work for "The Miami Times. "

861 861
00:49:19,754 --> 00:49:22,356
We're here on behalf here
of your nephew, Hillary.

862 862
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,595
You lost a shoe.

863 863
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,566
You're lucky it was
just the one.

864 864
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,402
Snakes all around here.

865 865
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:37,472
We need to talk to you about your nephew,
Mr. Van Wetter.

866 866
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,209
Little late for that,
isn't it?不是吗？

867 867
00:49:41,276 --> 00:49:43,479
He gonna be strapped
to a chair and electrocuted.

868 868
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:45,381
Well--

869 869
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:48,150
you come all the way up here
just to tell me that?

870 870
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:49,885
You could've saved
yourself a trip.

871 871
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:52,388
He tells me
that he was with you

872 872
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,423
the night Sheriff Call
was murdered,

873 873
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,325
stealing sod,
which you later sold.

874 874
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,897
Let's hope
nobody believes him.

875 875
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:04,001
Stealing's against the law,
ain't it?

876 876
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,836
Now he's still got time.

877 877
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,644
I don't much care
for you.给你。

878 878
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,045
Come up here
in my home--

879 879
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,180
and call me a thief.

880 880
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:23,855
I ain't up here about thieving,
Mr. Van Wetter.

881 881
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:28,593
I'm up here about whether a man's life
needs to be taken or not--

882 882
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,528
for the murder
of Sheriff Call.

883 883
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,772
But if you was with your nephew
that night,

884 884
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:42,040
it's vital for Hillary
that you admit it.

885 885
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:45,544
I don't think我不认为
he likes you much.

886 886
00:50:45,611 --> 00:50:47,046
I don't like him
much either.

887 887
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,454
Where's the ice cream?

888 888
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:56,989
It's coming.它的到来。

889 889
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:58,558
Keep that baby quiet.

890 890
00:51:01,193 --> 00:51:02,996
What's wrong这是怎么回事
with that baby?

891 891
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:06,533
All right, well, sit on it.

892 892
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:14,075
Yeah.是啊。

893 893
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:20,815
You want--?

894 894
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,851
You want a little ice cream?

895 895
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:29,190
You don't want
to have any ice cream.

896 896
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:31,492
You take this chair
out here with me.

897 897
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:37,065
No sense you staying
over there.那边。

898 898
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,269
Thank you.谢谢。

899 899
00:51:40,335 --> 00:51:42,337
Little man, get yourself
a chair there.

900 900
00:51:42,404 --> 00:51:43,438
Get yourself a chair.

901 901
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:49,344
Was you with him?

902 902
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:50,913
Yeah.是啊。

903 903
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:54,884
Well, I--

904 904
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,218
I was with him.

905 905
00:51:58,054 --> 00:51:59,055
Where?在哪里？

906 906
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,693
Golf club.

907 907
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,561
Ormond Beach.

908 908
00:52:08,198 --> 00:52:10,800
Stole sod, sold it--

909 909
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,071
to this one到这一个
condo developer.

910 910
00:52:15,572 --> 00:52:17,274
Where's Hillary
live from here?

911 911
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,577
We didn't get back
till the morning, sunrise.

912 912
00:52:22,446 --> 00:52:23,847
He lives that way.

913 913
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:25,749
So why are you那么，为什么你
telling me now?

914 914
00:52:28,153 --> 00:52:31,723
You seem like the only person
thinks Hillary's innocent.

915 915
00:52:33,658 --> 00:52:36,995
No, sir, Mr. Van Wetter.
No, sir.不，先生。

916 916
00:52:37,062 --> 00:52:38,330
I didn't say that.我没有这样说。

917 917
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:41,801
Your boy--

918 918
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,203
he's getting
nervous over there.

919 919
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,139
Let's go.让我们去。 I'm done我所做的一切
talking to you.

920 920
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:51,209
What you hiding?
Ward?

921 921
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:52,578
I'm sick--

922 922
00:52:52,645 --> 00:52:54,480
of your questions.您的问题。

923 923
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:58,284
Eugene?

924 924
00:53:05,424 --> 00:53:09,095
Ward, remember the first day
when I was with Charlotte? Yeah?是吗？

925 925
00:53:09,161 --> 00:53:10,696
We went and stopped
at the prison.

926 926
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:13,867
We didn't go in.
I saw him.我看见了他。

927 927
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:15,935
Tyree?
Yeah.是啊。

928 928
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,639
What you think?你觉得呢？ They was getting
their stories together?

929 929
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:20,040
I don't know.我不知道。

930 930
00:53:21,174 --> 00:53:22,609
I'll tell you this.

931 931
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:23,977
They ain't as dumb
as they look.

932 932
00:53:27,715 --> 00:53:29,449
Oh, shit, man.

933 933
00:53:31,386 --> 00:53:32,387
Fuck.他妈的。

934 934
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:42,964
What the fuck, man?你他妈的，男人吗？

935 935
00:53:44,632 --> 00:53:46,335
Leave me
at the fucking hotel?

936 936
00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:47,937
Jesus!天哪！

937 937
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,404
In Yardley's room,
no less.

938 938
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,638
Fuck, man.
Look at you.看看你。

939 939
00:53:54,076 --> 00:53:57,146
You're becoming obsessed
with this case.

940 940
00:53:57,212 --> 00:53:58,814
Wake me up.我叫醒。

941 941
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:02,985
Wake me up.我叫醒。

942 942
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:04,520
Come on.来吧。

943 943
00:54:04,587 --> 00:54:06,323
You look terrible, Ward.

944 944
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:09,358
Those mosquitoes eat
you for breakfast?

945 945
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:11,695
Yardley found
the golf course.高尔夫球场。

946 946
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:14,598
You found the golf course?
What's he doing in my clothes?

947 947
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:18,268
The car broke down.

948 948
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:20,003
we had to walk
into town,

949 949
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,340
stopped by the motel
to freshen up.

950 950
00:54:23,406 --> 00:54:25,842
Get out of my clothes now.

951 951
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:32,450
Come on.来吧。

952 952
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:34,018
Come on, Jack.

953 953
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:37,021
What are you doing?你在做什么？

954 954
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:38,856
Miss Bless.
Come on, stop it.

955 955
00:54:38,923 --> 00:54:40,091
Jack!杰克！

956 956
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:44,762
On the morning
of the murder

957 957
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:47,032
the grounds superintendent
of the Ormond Beach Golf Course

958 958
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,533
phoned the
Police Department警察局

959 959
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,034
to report that four
of his greens

960 960
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:51,703
had been stripped
in the night.在夜间。

961 961
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,472
You talked to the
superintendent? No.号

962 962
00:54:53,538 --> 00:54:55,474
He died, but I found
another guy who remembered

963 963
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,976
that the club
called the governor

964 964
00:54:58,043 --> 00:54:59,978
to ask him to declare them
a disaster area

965 965
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:01,881
so they could get
federal funds

966 966
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,049
to replace the greens.

967 967
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:04,750
It gets better.它变得更好。

968 968
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:06,486
I found the builder, too,

969 969
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:08,087
the guy who bought
the stolen greens.

970 970
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:10,222
He remembered
Hillary and Tyree.

971 971
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:12,558
They showed up
at 6 AM in a truck.

972 972
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,761
He took one look at them
and what they had

973 973
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:18,998
and thought they'd stolen
it from a cemetery.

974 974
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,802
But of course, he doesn't want to
be connected to this in any way.

975 975
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:24,437
And who was he?

976 976
00:55:24,504 --> 00:55:26,240
Well, the only way
he'd talk to me

977 977
00:55:26,307 --> 00:55:27,841
is if I promised
to keep him anonymous.

978 978
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,577
Come on now.
What's his name?他叫什么名字？

979 979
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:31,445
No, no, no.不，不，不。

980 980
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:33,447
I've got to keep it anonymous.
I gave him my word.

981 981
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:35,249
He's got, well,
he's in a position

982 982
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:38,452
to get some work from the state,
so you know.

983 983
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:41,189
But good, huh?

984 984
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:42,691
Outstanding.杰出。

985 985
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,796
How'd you find him?

986 986
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:50,197
Building permits.

987 987
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:55,036
Damn building permit.

988 988
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:00,442
Time to get out of Lately.

989 989
00:56:02,278 --> 00:56:03,678
Did you sleep
with Yardley?

990 990
00:56:06,048 --> 00:56:08,384
You know, people
like Yardley, you just--

991 991
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:14,490
got to get him
on your side.

992 992
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:15,892
You know what I mean?你明白我的意思吗？

993 993
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,729
You fucked him for that?

994 994
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:27,237
Fucking a man is the most natural
thing in the world, Jack.

995 995
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,572
It is.是的。

996 996
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:31,575
It is.是的。

997 997
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:38,749
I kind of like it我倒是很喜欢它
out here.

998 998
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,657
This was这是
a good idea.

999 999
00:56:49,594 --> 00:56:50,762
Oooh!哦！

1000 1000
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:52,997
Come on!来吧！
Let's dance.

1001 1001
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:58,102
Come on!来吧！
No! “不！”

1002 1002
00:56:58,169 --> 00:57:01,273
Come on, Jack.
Got to have fun!

1003 1003
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:08,213
You wanna dance?你想跳舞吗？

1004 1004
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,784
Yeah!是啊！ I wanna dance
with you!与您合作！

1005 1005
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,791
Woo!呜！ You're good!你是优秀的！

1006 1006
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:30,304
This is not me这不是我
apologizing, you dig?

1007 1007
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:32,539
I just don't like我只是不喜欢
to see you sad.

1008 1008
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:47,989
Yardley told their editor
about the new evidence

1009 1009
00:57:48,055 --> 00:57:50,425
from Ormond Beach.

1010 1010
00:57:50,492 --> 00:57:53,594
This was enough to show injustice
in the legal system of Lately

1011 1011
00:57:53,661 --> 00:57:55,597
and enough for a good story.

1012 1012
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:58,099
Yardley wanted to get
out of town

1013 1013
00:57:58,165 --> 00:57:59,667
and Ward knew it.

1014 1014
00:58:06,642 --> 00:58:10,413
All these peanuts
on the floor.在地板上。

1015 1015
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,682
Pigs.猪。 Bunch of pigs
living around here.

1016 1016
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:18,053
Sick of this shit.

1017 1017
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,423
I can't find我无法找到
Mama's ring.

1018 1018
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,193
Oh, well, a nigger
must have come

1019 1019
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,329
in the middle of the night半夜
and stole it.

1020 1020
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:36,907
I'm sorry, Anita.

1021 1021
00:58:36,974 --> 00:58:39,175
I didn't mean to say--

1022 1022
00:58:40,945 --> 00:58:43,147
I didn't mean我不是故意的
to say that.

1023 1023
00:58:43,213 --> 00:58:44,849
And I'm really sorry.

1024 1024
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:49,620
You know, Jackie, you got to watch
your mouth.你的嘴。

1025 1025
00:58:49,687 --> 00:58:53,190
Somebody'll cut your little ass
over some shit like that.

1026 1026
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:58,063
You understand me, boy?

1027 1027
00:58:58,129 --> 00:58:59,163
Yes, ma'am.是的，夫人。

1028 1028
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:06,338
And you miss
your mother?你妈妈呢？

1029 1029
00:59:07,973 --> 00:59:10,176
Sometimes.

1030 1030
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,978
It's a dis-damn grace
the way she left you.

1031 1031
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,317
And I been here.

1032 1032
00:59:23,155 --> 00:59:25,092
Well, let's find
this ring, I guess.

1033 2052
00:59:25,158 --> 00:59:27,760
No, that's all right.
I can find it.

1034 1034
00:59:49,016 --> 00:59:50,385
Ohhh.
Sorry.抱歉。

1035 1035
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:51,753
All right.好的。

1036 1036
00:59:53,453 --> 00:59:54,622
Okay.好吧。

1037 1037
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:57,358
I'm really sorry.我真的很抱歉。
Okay.好吧。

1038 1038
00:59:58,526 --> 01:00:01,462
All right, Jack.

1039 1039
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:03,798
What's makes
this story any different?

1040 1040
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:06,567
What makes your story different
than the others, John?

1041 1041
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:09,738
What makes this case so different that you
want to pull the plug now?

1042 1042
01:00:09,805 --> 01:00:11,540
The facts.
What's left to do?剩下要做的是什么？

1043 1043
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:13,207
You've been up there
a month and a half.

1044 1044
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:14,877
I want我想
your ass back here.

1045 1045
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,879
Save that shit
for someone else.

1046 1046
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,213
I'm not comfortable with it
and you shouldn't be either.

1047 1047
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:20,983
I'm going to Ormond Beach
to get the facts.

1048 1048
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:26,655
I want to get some
alligator shoes.

1049 1049
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:29,926
You run this article,
this shit could hurt me.

1050 1050
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,228
I got advertisers
to think of.

1051 1051
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,265
A dvertisers? You want你想
me to be concerned

1052 1052
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:37,434
with the advertisers
for your newspaper?

1053 1053
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,902
Ward, you don't
know everything.

1054 1054
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,403
He knows
what he's doing, Pa.

1055 1055
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,238
Shut up!闭嘴！ I'm not我不
talking to you.

1056 1056
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,175
He knows
how to get stories,

1057 1057
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,276
but what he doesn't
fully appreciate

1058 1058
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,280
is that the stories
go out into a community.

1059 1059
01:00:49,347 --> 01:00:50,581
They resonate.

1060 1060
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,350
Oh, like the jellyfish?

1061 1061
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,852
Like getting pissed on?

1062 1062
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:57,955
You notice Anita's been acting
mighty bossy recently?

1063 1063
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:02,793
She's always been
that way.这种方式。 Yeah.是啊。

1064 1064
01:01:05,264 --> 01:01:07,531
Oh, shit.哦，该死。

1065 1065
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:10,202
Darling, let it go.
Don't get yourself hurt.

1066 1066
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:12,803
Sit down.坐下。
I'll get Anita. Anita!梅艳芳！

1067 1067
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,107
Hey, I'll take
care of it.呵护它。

1068 1068
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:18,343
Anita will get it. Anita!梅艳芳！ Does she难道她
have children? I can't remember.我不记得了。

1069 1069
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:23,950
She got two kids.
Oh, yeah.哦，是的。

1070 1070
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:29,555
How you doing, baby doll?
Where you going?你要去哪里？

1071 1071
01:01:29,622 --> 01:01:31,491
Hoo.
A baby shower.

1072 1072
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:33,659
Um, Anita, uh,
before you go,

1073 1073
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:35,662
could you clean
up this mess.

1074 1074
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,997
I said I got it. It's all right.它的所有权利。
Anita's got it.

1075 1075
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:42,735
I got it.我得到了它。

1076 1076
01:01:43,736 --> 01:01:45,139
I got it.我得到了它。

1077 1077
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:46,940
We're going我们将
to Ormond Beach.

1078 1078
01:01:47,006 --> 01:01:50,411
Oh, just come right
out and tell them.

1079 1079
01:01:50,477 --> 01:01:53,847
I've named Ellen
editor-in-chief.

1080 1080
01:01:57,885 --> 01:02:00,254
And--

1081 1081
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:01,522
we're getting married.我们就要结婚了。

1082 1082
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:13,500
It's an antique.

1083 1083
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,770
I know it is.

1084 1084
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:19,275
This belonged
to my mother.

1085 1085
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:22,110
It was a gift from me.
Give it back, Jack.

1086 1086
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:24,513
Just give it
back to her.

1087 1087
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,616
It's all I got.

1088 1088
01:02:26,681 --> 01:02:28,784
Ward never believed
Yardley's story.

1089 1089
01:02:28,851 --> 01:02:30,820
Building permits
and anonymous sources.

1090 1090
01:02:30,886 --> 01:02:33,556
He took Charlotte and Jack
back to Ormond Beach

1091 1091
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:35,558
to get to the bottom of it.

1092 1092
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,627
Yardley went back home
to Miami.迈阿密。

1093 1093
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:39,863
# That man is dangerous #

1094 1094
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:44,034
# Loving him is dangerous #

1095 1095
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,404
# That man is dangerous #

1096 1096
01:02:50,807 --> 01:02:52,576
# Loving him is dangerous #

1097 1097
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:57,047
# That man is dangerous #

1098 1098
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,651
What is that builder's name,
Charlotte?夏洛特？

1099 1099
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:02,586
What builder?

1100 1100
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,656
You know你知道吗
exactly what builder.

1101 1101
01:03:04,722 --> 01:03:07,090
The one Yardley
says bought the sod.

1102 1102
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:08,493
I don't know.我不知道。
He went alone.

1103 1103
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,529
I went我去了
to the hairdresser's.

1104 1104
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:13,264
Takes a lot
to look like this.

1105 1105
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:17,001
Charlotte Bless,
you is a mess.

1106 1106
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:19,271
And you'd do anything
to get your man

1107 1107
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:22,674
out of jail--
wouldn't you?不是吗？

1108 1108
01:03:27,146 --> 01:03:28,614
Thirsty, huh?

1109 1109
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:29,848
Oh, yeah.哦，是的。

1110 1110
01:03:29,915 --> 01:03:32,918
# That man is dangerous #

1111 1111
01:03:32,985 --> 01:03:35,354
You keep staring
like that,

1112 1112
01:03:35,421 --> 01:03:38,090
we're gonna have
a problem.一个问题。

1113 1113
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:40,960
What really happened到底发生了什么
down there, Charlotte?

1114 1114
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,363
After you went to the hairdresser,
what happened?发生了什么？ Hm?嗯？

1115 1115
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,832
Jack, would you tell your brother to get
his hands off of me?

1116 1116
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,868
Come on, man.来吧，伙计。 Let's go somewhere else.
Easy, little brother.

1117 1117
01:03:48,935 --> 01:03:51,104
Just fucking relax, boy.

1118 1118
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:53,274
Miss Bless ain't got
no answer, huh?

1119 1119
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:57,277
I didn't think so.我不这么认为。

1120 1120
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:03,150
Your brother's
acting strange.

1121 1121
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:05,553
Not used to drinking
like this.是这样的。

1122 1122
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,155
# Is this love affair for real
Or is it just one and done? # ＃

1123 1123
01:04:08,222 --> 01:04:10,224
# I'm telling you #

1124 1124
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:11,826
A little more多一点
than that.比。

1125 1125
01:04:19,701 --> 01:04:21,035
Why is Ward doing this?

1126 1126
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:25,140
We got 50 places
to be tomorrow.

1127 1127
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,250
What is that?那是什么？

1128 1128
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:37,987
It's beautiful.它的美丽。

1129 1129
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:43,259
Don't turn it down.

1130 1130
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:46,062
No one's ever given me
something like this before.

1131 1131
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:55,405
Well, you just tell me
when you want it back, huh?

1132 1132
01:04:57,006 --> 01:04:58,909
It's beautiful.它的美丽。

1133 1133
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:19,564
You want me你要我
to fuck you, Jack?

1134 1134
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:23,401
Then I'm gonna fuck you
any way you want.任何你想要的方式。

1135 1135
01:05:26,805 --> 01:05:28,740
Jack.杰克。

1136 1136
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:32,645
Jack!杰克！

1137 1137
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:36,915
I want to get我想要得到的
some alligator shoes.

1138 1138
01:05:36,982 --> 01:05:39,085
Mmm, Jack.

1139 1139
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:41,886
You wanted您想
your ass whupped.

1140 1140
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:43,422
Is that what you wanted?这是你想要的吗？

1141 1141
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:45,057
Tell me请告诉我
what you want.你想要什么。

1142 1142
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:46,692
You're a dirty pig.

1143 1143
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:48,928
I'll fuck you我会他妈的你
any way you want.任何你想要的方式。

1144 1144
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:51,397
Little white pig.

1145 1145
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:57,504
Jack?杰克？ Jack!杰克！ Jack!杰克！

1146 1146
01:05:57,571 --> 01:05:58,605
Jack, wake up!

1147 1147
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,974
Something's going
on in Ward's room.

1148 1148
01:06:28,103 --> 01:06:29,837
Hey!嘿！ Hey!嘿！

1149 1149
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:31,639
Stop it!住手！

1150 1150
01:06:31,706 --> 01:06:32,908
What the fuck?怎么回事？

1151 1151
01:06:36,678 --> 01:06:38,881
Help!请帮助我！
We need help!我们需要帮助！

1152 1152
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:17,254
Where's the fucking keys?

1153 1153
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:19,523
Where's the fucking keys,
you piece of shit?

1154 1154
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,525
Motherfucker, wake up!

1155 1155
01:07:24,428 --> 01:07:25,263
Help!请帮助我！

1156 1156
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,934
Where are在哪里
the fucking keys?

1157 1157
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:31,736
Ward, what's
the plastic for?

1158 1158
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:35,607
What is the plastic?

1159 1159
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:43,515
What the fuck?怎么回事？

1160 1160
01:08:02,936 --> 01:08:05,238
I've watched you so often.

1161 1161
01:08:05,305 --> 01:08:08,309
You sit here, and I heard
that you play a little drum.

1162 1162
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,210
You didn't get up
and do anything. No.号

1163 1163
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:12,947
I heard you could sing,

1164 1164
01:08:13,013 --> 01:08:14,581
but with me you
are going to sing.

1165 1165
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:20,821
He's gonna be fine.

1166 1166
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:02,499
You don't have to sleep
all the way down there.

1167 1167
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:33,131
All right.好的。

1168 1168
01:09:33,197 --> 01:09:34,899
Just this once.

1169 1169
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,543
I can't fuck
with this TV on.

1170 1170
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:51,149
Feels kind of awkward
to be talking

1171 1171
01:09:51,215 --> 01:09:52,685
while you see this.

1172 1172
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:02,696
But it's kind of awkward that
they're doing it in the first place.

1173 1173
01:10:08,602 --> 01:10:10,836
Most boys Jack's age
fall in love坠入爱河

1174 1174
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:13,173
with their high school
or college sweetheart,

1175 1175
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:15,875
but Jack never bothered
much with girls

1176 1176
01:10:15,942 --> 01:10:17,177
after his mama left.

1177 1177
01:10:22,116 --> 01:10:24,951
I guess you could say
he had abandonment issues.

1178 1178
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:28,122
With Charlotte, it was like he
was getting his mama,

1179 1179
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:31,726
his high school sweetheart,
and a oversexed Barbie doll

1180 1180
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:33,628
all rolled into one.

1181 1181
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,237
Anywho, I think
y'all seen enough.

1182 1182
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:48,310
My hair looks like crap.
Don't even look at it.

1183 1183
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,078
Oh, shit.哦，该死。

1184 1184
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,581
I got to go
to the hairdresser.

1185 1185
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,484
My wig
ain't acting right.

1186 1186
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:56,953
I don't understand我不明白
what the fuck什么他妈的

1187 1187
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,654
you're doing
with Hillary.

1188 1188
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,159
Oh.哦。

1189 1189
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:06,763
Here we go.在这里，我们走了。

1190 1190
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,398
You don't love him.

1191 1191
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,601
Really?真的吗？
Mm-hm.嗯。

1192 1192
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,002
You don't know that.你不知道。

1193 1193
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:17,374
You don't know anything.你什么都不知道。

1194 1194
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:19,609
You're 20 years old.
You're not that much older.

1195 1195
01:11:20,945 --> 01:11:22,613
I'm a lot older.

1196 1196
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:26,183
It ain't gonna happen.

1197 1197
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,418
Look at me.

1198 1198
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:29,019
It's not practical.

1199 1199
01:11:29,086 --> 01:11:31,422
I'm not as practical
as the murderer?

1200 1200
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,624
He's not guilty, Jack.
That's the point.这是一点。

1201 1201
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:35,927
That's not the point.这不是问题的关键。
Fuck this.他妈的这个。 I knew it would happen.

1202 1202
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:37,429
What?什么？

1203 1203
01:11:37,495 --> 01:11:39,129
I give you some ass
and suddenly--

1204 1204
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:45,135
Look--Hillary
ain't so bad.

1205 1205
01:11:45,202 --> 01:11:47,472
And I'm not so good.

1206 1206
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:50,041
I've got another side.

1207 1207
01:11:50,108 --> 01:11:51,843
I got a fucked-up side,

1208 1208
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,878
and it gets along
just fine with my man.

1209 1209
01:11:53,945 --> 01:11:55,815
You can't split
yourself into sides.

1210 1210
01:11:55,881 --> 01:11:57,750
Sure, you can.
Just ask your brother.

1211 1211
01:11:57,817 --> 01:11:59,985
What the fuck does Ward
have to do with this?

1212 1212
01:12:00,051 --> 01:12:02,054
He has a dark side and I don't mean
him being a fag.

1213 1213
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:05,992
Now these boys
lived for each other.

1214 1214
01:12:06,058 --> 01:12:10,296
Jack wasn't hurt by Ward
being a homosexual

1215 1215
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:13,232
or the dark stuff
that he was into.

1216 1216
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:16,670
He was just hurt
that Ward never told him.

1217 1217
01:12:21,808 --> 01:12:23,910
Hi.你好。
Hey, there.嘿，你好。

1218 1218
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:28,382
H e's doing better.
He's gonna be all right. Good.好。

1219 1219
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,085
So, I gotta go.

1220 1220
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:34,421
Go where?去哪里？
Where you going?你要去哪里？

1221 1221
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:37,158
I'm going back home.

1222 1222
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,362
You don't have
to go anywhere.

1223 1223
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:44,198
It's just the way这只是方式
it works.它的工作原理。

1224 1224
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:46,167
You shouldn't go anywhere
you don't want to go.

1225 1225
01:12:51,607 --> 01:12:53,274
Who says谁说：
I don't want to go?

1226 1226
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,111
Why do you have to go?

1227 1227
01:12:58,113 --> 01:12:59,347
'Cause I do.

1228 1228
01:13:00,783 --> 01:13:02,418
Take this ring back.

1229 1229
01:13:04,186 --> 01:13:05,721
Yardley called the hotel.

1230 1230
01:13:05,788 --> 01:13:07,656
Did you tell him?

1231 1231
01:13:07,723 --> 01:13:09,959
I told him Ward got mugged
and beaten on the beach.

1232 1232
01:13:13,629 --> 01:13:14,964
Well, what'd he say?

1233 1233
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:17,400
Not much.没有多少。

1234 1234
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:19,468
Wanted to know
if he was gonna make it.

1235 1235
01:13:19,535 --> 01:13:21,871
When I told him
it wasn't serious,

1236 1236
01:13:21,938 --> 01:13:25,209
he kind of just lost interest.
He's not gonna be much help for a while.

1237 1237
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,311
Didn't sound like he needed
much help.

1238 1238
01:13:28,378 --> 01:13:30,815
He can't go write the story
alone, Charlotte.

1239 1239
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:33,917
Well, we'll just have to see.
He doesn't know enough about it.

1240 1240
01:13:33,984 --> 01:13:35,786
This isn't about
a newspaper article, Jack.

1241 1241
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,388
It's about
a person's life.

1242 1242
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,089
That's the whole point
we're here, okay?

1243 1243
01:13:39,155 --> 01:13:40,925
So it's about
someone's life.

1244 1244
01:13:43,728 --> 01:13:46,564
Baby, don't go.

1245 1245
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,766
You're starting to screw
with my head.

1246 1246
01:13:50,669 --> 01:13:52,570
Look, you're a good kid,
all right?没事吧？

1247 1247
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:55,774
You're--

1248 1248
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:59,110
You got your whole life
ahead of you,

1249 1249
01:13:59,176 --> 01:14:00,646
and you want me?

1250 1250
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,253
Jack went down
to "The Miami Times"

1251 1251
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,690
to try to stop Yardley
from publishing the article.

1252 1252
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:15,295
He didn't want
his brother's name on it.

1253 1253
01:14:16,195 --> 01:14:17,864
Jack.杰克。

1254 1254
01:14:19,464 --> 01:14:21,200
Hi.你好。

1255 1255
01:14:21,267 --> 01:14:25,205
Hey.嘿。 How's Ward?
How's your brother doing?

1256 1256
01:14:25,272 --> 01:14:27,307
Been trying to get ahold
of you since yesterday.

1257 1257
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:29,977
Good.好。 He's obviously
not doing so badly then.

1258 1258
01:14:30,044 --> 01:14:34,982
Sorry, I didn't want
any distractions. Come, sit, sit.

1259 1259
01:14:35,049 --> 01:14:37,384
He wants to read
what you're writing.

1260 1260
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:39,987
A s soon as I'm done, he'll be the first
to read it, as always.

1261 1261
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,157
Damn it!该死！ I'm so sick
of your shit, man!

1262 1262
01:14:43,223 --> 01:14:45,093
His name他的名字
is on that, too.

1263 1263
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,162
He wants to read it
before it's published.

1264 1264
01:14:48,228 --> 01:14:49,998
Okay?可以吗？ That's it.就是这样。
Uh-huh.嗯。

1265 1265
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:52,667
He just wants to read it
before it's published.

1266 1266
01:14:52,733 --> 01:14:54,836
You got to get
those facts straight.

1267 1267
01:14:54,903 --> 01:14:57,172
You got to get
all the facts straight.

1268 1268
01:14:57,238 --> 01:14:59,841
You're starting to sound
like your brother.

1269 1269
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:02,477
Look, we have
a deadline here.

1270 1270
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:04,479
I've told you, this is
the newspaper business.

1271 1271
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,247
We don't have time
to get all the facts.

1272 1272
01:15:06,314 --> 01:15:09,084
We both know the town
of Lately set Hillary up.

1273 1273
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,254
We've got the story.
It's not the fucking truth!

1274 1274
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:15,057
You want to talk
about the motherfucking truth?

1275 1275
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:21,597
You thought
I was from London?

1276 1276
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:23,699
Ain't no Negro getting
a job up in this spot

1277 1277
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:27,069
unless he's a colored
motherfucking James Bond, you dig?

1278 1278
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:32,042
I got drunk once
and let Ward suck my dick.

1279 1279
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:36,179
He got a taste for niggers
and now he hates himself.

1280 1280
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:37,614
That's the truth.这是事实。

1281 1281
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:42,219
Go back to your brother, boy.

1282 1282
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,392
I have got a deadline to meet.

1283 1283
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:26,434
Hello?喂？

1284 1284
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,071
Put Ward
on the phone.

1285 1285
01:16:30,137 --> 01:16:32,940
Why'd you put his byline
on that article?

1286 1286
01:16:33,007 --> 01:16:34,675
How could you sign
his name on that?

1287 1287
01:16:34,742 --> 01:16:36,744
Tell him we got
Hillary out.

1288 1288
01:16:36,811 --> 01:16:38,613
The governor's
gonna pardon him.

1289 1289
01:16:41,749 --> 01:16:43,618
Hillary's getting out.

1290 1290
01:16:47,154 --> 01:16:49,257
"I've had some time to think
over the past few months

1291 1291
01:16:49,324 --> 01:16:52,861
about me, about you.

1292 1292
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:55,530
I'm not sure I found
what I want out of life yet.

1293 1293
01:16:55,597 --> 01:16:59,202
All I know is that I don't want
to live it without you.

1294 1294
01:16:59,268 --> 01:17:02,104
Please take this ring back.
Love, Jack. " “

1295 1295
01:17:10,179 --> 01:17:11,714
Get the door.

1296 1296
01:17:15,618 --> 01:17:18,454
Get the fucking
door, bitch!

1297 1297
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,673
Who the fuck are you?你到底是谁？

1298 1298
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:37,641
I'm Hillary.
What you want?你要什么？

1299 1299
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,344
Get the fuck out!
I'm with Charlotte.

1300 1300
01:17:39,411 --> 01:17:41,078
That bitch took my--
I'll call you later!

1301 1301
01:17:44,382 --> 01:17:47,018
Charlotte, you want me
to call the police?

1302 1302
01:17:56,494 --> 01:17:58,430
There she is.在那里，她是。

1303 1303
01:17:59,732 --> 01:18:01,099
I'm sorry.对不起。

1304 1304
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,767
I was gonna write
you a letter--

1305 1305
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:05,204
No, I don't need
your letters. Come here.到这里来。

1306 1306
01:18:10,343 --> 01:18:11,544
Uh--呃 - 

1307 1307
01:18:18,685 --> 01:18:20,087
Don't touch me.不要碰我。

1308 1308
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:21,854
Come on here.
Don't touch you?

1309 1309
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:25,559
Don't touch you?

1310 1310
01:18:28,194 --> 01:18:30,097
It's okay.这没关系。

1311 1311
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:32,232
It's all right, baby.

1312 1312
01:18:46,781 --> 01:18:47,815
Anything.任何东西。

1313 1313
01:18:56,824 --> 01:18:57,625
That's all right.没关系。

1314 1314
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:17,579
You told me you loved me你告诉我你爱我
in your third letter.

1315 1315
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:19,683
Do you love me?你爱我吗？

1316 1316
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:22,117
Yes!是的！

1317 1317
01:19:46,043 --> 01:19:49,046
You always fuck
like this?这样的吗？

1318 1318
01:19:49,113 --> 01:19:50,781
Like it was喜欢它
the last time?

1319 1319
01:19:57,788 --> 01:19:59,725
Do you think I'm pretty?

1320 1320
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,259
You fuck
those niggers like this?

1321 1321
01:20:09,134 --> 01:20:11,870
Gonna get all inside here!

1322 1322
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:17,342
Now pack your shit
and let's go.

1323 1323
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:26,986
I don't think I'm gonna like
living in a swamp.

1324 1324
01:20:27,053 --> 01:20:31,090
I don't want to live in a swamp.
I like it here.我喜欢这里。

1325 1325
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:38,032
And that was而这
their declaration of love.

1326 1326
01:20:38,098 --> 01:20:40,834
So Hillary took
Charlotte to the swamp.

1327 1327
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,550
So did you hear
about old man Henry? No.号

1328 1328
01:20:56,617 --> 01:20:59,287
He got drunk in his back yard
by the water,

1329 1329
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,324
and the alligators came out and took
a big chunk of his leg.

1330 1330
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,694
Ha.哈。 Just joking.只是在开玩笑。

1331 1331
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,064
My daddy rooster,
he got jumped

1332 1332
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,865
by three of his sons,

1333 1333
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:13,903
so I need to find a home
for three of them.

1334 1334
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:16,071
So he's于是，他
in my house sitting,

1335 1335
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:18,207
so I need--I know
you only have hens.

1336 1336
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:20,710
That's why I was wondering,
you know, if you want to babysit,

1337 1337
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:22,979
you know, adopt three
of them for you.

1338 1338
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:26,716
But they'd be good though,
because you have hens. No.号

1339 1339
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:30,186
You're my only hope.
No! “不！” I don't want any.

1340 1340
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:31,554
Come on, Charlotte.

1341 1341
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:33,423
I need you我需要你
to do me a favor.

1342 1342
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:35,092
I need you to post
this thing for me.

1343 1343
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:37,226
It ain't got
a stamp on it.

1344 1344
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,895
What's wrong with you today?
It's real important.

1345 1345
01:21:38,962 --> 01:21:40,497
You think you can do
that for me?

1346 1346
01:21:40,564 --> 01:21:42,332
You're not acting
yourself today.

1347 1347
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:50,073
Why's your door open, huh?

1348 1348
01:21:52,744 --> 01:21:54,212
Smells like piss in here.

1349 1349
01:21:54,312 --> 01:21:56,947
Ward Ward said
you might show up.

1350 1350
01:21:57,014 --> 01:21:58,349
Left him a note.

1351 1351
01:21:59,684 --> 01:22:01,452
You stink.

1352 1352
01:22:01,519 --> 01:22:03,187
I can smell you
from over here.

1353 1353
01:22:03,254 --> 01:22:06,457
Come here, boy.
Come sit down.

1354 1354
01:22:06,524 --> 01:22:08,594
What you doing
back in Miami?

1355 1355
01:22:12,698 --> 01:22:14,166
Yardley's gone.

1356 1356
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,367
He quit?

1357 1357
01:22:16,434 --> 01:22:17,870
No.号

1358 1358
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,308
He's in New York.

1359 1359
01:22:24,043 --> 01:22:26,145
Signing some book deal.

1360 1360
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:30,382
Hero of the new journalism
or some kind of shit. I don't know.我不知道。

1361 1361
01:22:30,449 --> 01:22:33,286
W.W. W.W. moved Ellen
into the house, huh?

1362 1362
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:36,555
Whatever.不管。

1363 1363
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:40,126
Whatever makes him happy.

1364 1364
01:23:07,856 --> 01:23:09,925
There wasn't
no developer, Jack.

1365 1365
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,533
All right, let's move.

1366 1366
01:23:20,002 --> 01:23:21,103
Come on,来吧，
go shower, Ward.

1367 1367
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:23,172
I'm tired.我累了。

1368 1368
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:26,441
Come on.来吧。

1369 1369
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,345
Jeez.哎呀。

1370 1370
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,396
I keep thinking
I missed something, Jack.

1371 1371
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:52,770
Like I missed something
I was supposed to see

1372 1372
01:23:52,836 --> 01:23:54,471
that was right
in front of me.在我的面前。

1373 1373
01:23:54,538 --> 01:23:56,006
Like what?像什么？

1374 1374
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,811
The point of it.

1375 1375
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,415
Doesn't matter.无所谓。

1376 1376
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,819
Things got out of hand.

1377 1377
01:24:07,886 --> 01:24:09,854
You got hurt,

1378 1378
01:24:09,954 --> 01:24:12,424
Yardley got
his fucking book deal.

1379 1379
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:16,762
Hillary got Charlotte
in the swamp.

1380 1380
01:24:18,897 --> 01:24:23,569
The idea--is that--
you run the water

1381 1381
01:24:23,636 --> 01:24:24,836
while you're
in there with it.

1382 1382
01:24:26,338 --> 01:24:27,506
Come on, man.来吧，伙计。

1383 1383
01:24:34,847 --> 01:24:36,182
Hey.嘿。

1384 1384
01:24:43,857 --> 01:24:46,525
What if we didn't get
it right, huh?

1385 1385
01:24:47,761 --> 01:24:49,229
Makes no difference.没有什么区别。

1386 1386
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:50,930
It makes no difference,
Jack?杰克？

1387 1387
01:24:50,997 --> 01:24:52,466
You don't know你不知道
what it feels like

1388 1388
01:24:52,566 --> 01:24:54,801
to get it
exactly right now.

1389 1389
01:24:54,868 --> 01:24:58,739
To get it down just
the way it happened.

1390 1390
01:24:58,805 --> 01:25:00,440
You're going你会
back to see Hillary.

1391 1391
01:25:00,507 --> 01:25:02,010
Fuck yeah, I am.

1392 1392
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,711
Do you ever hear
from her?

1393 1393
01:25:04,778 --> 01:25:06,113
No.号

1394 1394
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:08,116
Miss Bless?
No.号

1395 1395
01:25:08,182 --> 01:25:10,551
I wonder what she thinks
of him now, huh?

1396 1396
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,822
Can't see her sitting
on the porch stoop

1397 1397
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:16,959
holding a silver spoon

1398 1398
01:25:17,026 --> 01:25:19,494
and waiting for the ice cream carton
to come her way, can you?

1399 1399
01:25:22,197 --> 01:25:23,966
I dug around.

1400 1400
01:25:24,033 --> 01:25:26,468
There wasn't no proof,
no how, nowhere

1401 1401
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:29,838
that they was ever
stealing sod that night.

1402 1402
01:25:29,905 --> 01:25:33,842
They want me
to keep my mouth shut.

1403 1403
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:37,681
Don't want me to tell my story.
Well, fuck them.

1404 1404
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:40,516
I'm gonna tell my story.
I'm gonna write my story,

1405 1405
01:25:40,582 --> 01:25:43,687
and they can publish it
wherever the fuck they want to.

1406 1406
01:25:51,428 --> 01:25:54,431
Yeah, Mama always said
you better be--

1407 1407
01:25:54,497 --> 01:26:00,670
right and be last before you gonna be
first and be wrong, boy.

1408 1408
01:26:00,737 --> 01:26:04,008
Be right and be last before you go
gonna be first and be wrong--

1409 1409
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,308
Yeah, I know!是啊，我知道！

1410 1410
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,137
I heard--
They said things about--

1411 1411
01:26:32,204 --> 01:26:34,239
Oh, yeah.哦，是的。
It's all true.这一切都是真的。

1412 1412
01:26:34,306 --> 01:26:37,377
Just kidding.只是在开玩笑。
You should see the other guy.

1413 1413
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:40,646
Smile.微笑。
Smile.微笑。

1414 1414
01:26:40,712 --> 01:26:41,814
Thank you.谢谢。

1415 1415
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,423
Everyone, please.
We're cutting the cake!

1416 1416
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,958
Where's the photographer?

1417 1417
01:26:54,227 --> 01:26:55,695
Hey, Claire,
can you hand me

1418 1418
01:26:55,762 --> 01:26:58,598
that salt over there?

1419 1419
01:26:58,665 --> 01:26:59,632
Thank you.谢谢。

1420 1420
01:27:01,468 --> 01:27:02,836
Hi.你好。

1421 1421
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:06,840
You ain't supposed
to be in here.

1422 1422
01:27:06,907 --> 01:27:08,642
You gonna get me in--
I got you a drink.

1423 1423
01:27:12,746 --> 01:27:16,184
You know你知道吗
W. W. fired me.

1424 1424
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:17,952
I'm gonna talk
to your boss

1425 1425
01:27:18,019 --> 01:27:19,753
and tell him you're a friend
of the family.

1426 1426
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,656
No, Jack.
Yeah.是啊。

1427 1427
01:27:21,723 --> 01:27:23,625
All I ever did was cook
and clean for you boys.

1428 1428
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:25,759
I wasn't never no family.

1429 1429
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:28,964
Anyway, go on back outside.

1430 1430
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:32,434
Well, Ward's out there.
You gonna come see him?

1431 1431
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,803
Are you trying
to get me fired?

1432 1432
01:27:34,869 --> 01:27:36,172
I miss you.我很想念你。

1433 1433
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:43,612
I got something for you.我有东西给你。
Wait a minute.等待一分钟。

1434 1434
01:27:52,955 --> 01:27:54,824
This came for you
about a month ago.

1435 1435
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:56,660
She told him to tell-

1436 1436
01:27:56,727 --> 01:28:00,496
She told him她告诉他，
not to let you see it.

1437 1437
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:03,033
"Dear Jack,
I can't believe我简直不敢相信

1438 1438
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:05,769
I'm finally writing you
this letter

1439 1439
01:28:05,836 --> 01:28:07,404
or if it will get to you

1440 1440
01:28:07,471 --> 01:28:10,273
or whether
you'll even read it.

1441 1441
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,577
Jack, I think I've really
messed up this time.

1442 1442
01:28:13,644 --> 01:28:15,112
Don't misunderstand me.

1443 1443
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:17,415
Hillary lo ves me,
in his way.

1444 1444
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:19,750
It's just me that isn't made
for this place,

1445 1445
01:28:19,816 --> 01:28:22,320
for this lifestyle.

1446 1446
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:25,256
I hope I can make it
to your father's wedding

1447 1447
01:28:25,323 --> 01:28:30,696
so I can hear you tell me,
'I told you so.'

1448 1448
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:35,501
Take care for now.
Sweetly, your Charlotte. " “

1449 1449
01:28:39,038 --> 01:28:40,873
Is that from blondie?

1450 1450
01:28:49,048 --> 01:28:50,082
Thank you.谢谢。

1451 1451
01:28:52,218 --> 01:28:53,686
Where's your hat?

1452 1452
01:28:53,752 --> 01:28:55,455
Oh, I forgot.哦，我忘了。
Get out of the kitchen.

1453 1453
01:28:55,522 --> 01:28:57,290
I'm sorry.对不起。

1454 1454
01:28:57,357 --> 01:28:59,426
Excuse me.对不起。 I'm Jack Jansen.
I'm the groom's son.

1455 1455
01:28:59,492 --> 01:29:01,961
My father wants to know
what exactly is taking dinner so long.

1456 1456
01:29:02,062 --> 01:29:03,863
It'll be ready in a minute, sir.
Thank you.谢谢。

1457 1457
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,733
Put the hair
under the hat.

1458 1458
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,202
I don't want your black hair
in my food.

1459 1459
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:14,741
You can put your black hair
in my food.

1460 1460
01:29:20,247 --> 01:29:21,482
Cheers.的欢呼声。

1461 1461
01:29:27,054 --> 01:29:28,422
Bye, Anita.

1462 1462
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:40,335
Bye, Jack.

1463 1463
01:29:58,454 --> 01:30:00,423
You wouldn't leave
without me, would you?

1464 1464
01:30:00,523 --> 01:30:03,593
Drop you off at the motel.
I'm going somewhere.

1465 1465
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:06,130
Mind me asking where
you're going afterwards?

1466 1466
01:30:06,196 --> 01:30:07,463
Going to Charlotte's.

1467 1467
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,098
Well, it gotta be tonight?

1468 1468
01:30:09,165 --> 01:30:10,634
I got to get her
the fuck out of there.

1469 1469
01:30:10,701 --> 01:30:12,269
I got to get her
out of there!

1470 1470
01:30:12,336 --> 01:30:13,970
Charlotte's acting
on her own free will.

1471 1471
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:15,506
What do you want me
to say?说什么？ Move.移动。

1472 1472
01:30:15,606 --> 01:30:17,141
I got to go
to the Van Wetters' anyway.

1473 1473
01:30:17,207 --> 01:30:18,842
Come with me跟我来
tomorrow morning.

1474 1474
01:30:18,909 --> 01:30:20,944
We're going now.
It ain't the right time.

1475 1475
01:30:21,011 --> 01:30:23,347
Get the fuck out my way.
You ain't driving drunk like this.

1476 1476
01:30:23,414 --> 01:30:25,183
What the fuck are you gonna
do about it, huh?

1477 1477
01:30:26,685 --> 01:30:27,851
What?什么？

1478 1478
01:30:36,227 --> 01:30:38,396
Charlotte must be
a good piece of ass.

1479 1479
01:30:38,463 --> 01:30:41,232
You look like a pirate.
I know.我知道。

1480 1480
01:30:41,299 --> 01:30:43,668
Do this for me
one time. Go "Aargh. "

1481 1481
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:44,369
Uh-huh.嗯。

1482 1482
01:30:47,138 --> 01:30:49,909
Hey, you're driving
all squirrelly, man.

1483 1483
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:52,211
Hey, Jack,
sit on down. Hey.嘿。

1484 1484
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:01,020
You sure
it's this way?

1485 1485
01:31:01,087 --> 01:31:02,388
I'm sure我敢肯定，
it's this way.

1486 1486
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,760
Ain't a good time to be drinking
too much out here, Jack.

1487 1487
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:11,031
Yeah, you're one to talk.

1488 1488
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:13,367
Keeping your promise
to Dad, did you?

1489 1489
01:31:13,433 --> 01:31:15,102
Not to drink
on his big day?

1490 1490
01:31:15,168 --> 01:31:17,938
How you holding up?

1491 1491
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,608
Let's see your hands.
Are they shaking?

1492 1492
01:31:20,674 --> 01:31:25,546
They shaking, Ward, huh?
Don't drink.

1493 1493
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,949
Well, why do you take
after the worst of me, Jack?

1494 1494
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:32,954
'Cause you're my brother.

1495 1495
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:43,264
Wedding party, Charlotte?

1496 1496
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,733
I'm going我要去
to the wedding.

1497 1497
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,468
Don't be difficult.

1498 1498
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:48,202
I don't want you to go.我不想让你走。

1499 1499
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:50,306
No. I told you. I'm going to我要

1500 1500
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:52,441

God, it smells
like shit.像屎一样。

1502 1502
01:31:59,649 --> 01:32:02,785
Electric fence.
You all right?你没事吧？

1503 1503
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,321
You all right?你没事吧？

1504 1504
01:32:04,387 --> 01:32:06,656
Goddamn.该死的。

1505 1505
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,069
You let me lead.

1506 1506
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:36,721
I don't want to quarrel
with you.和你在一起。

1507 1507
01:32:36,787 --> 01:32:38,456
You're my little pony.

1508 1508
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:43,794
I just want to climb
up on you one more time.

1509 1509
01:32:56,375 --> 01:32:58,143
I can't believe我简直不敢相信
she'd live here.

1510 1510
01:33:09,055 --> 01:33:10,390
Charlotte!夏洛特！

1511 1511
01:33:39,921 --> 01:33:41,389
Charlotte?夏洛特？

1512 1512
01:33:49,364 --> 01:33:50,598
Charlotte!夏洛特！

1513 1513
01:33:58,106 --> 01:33:59,542
What you want?你要什么？

1514 1514
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:08,985
She not here.

1515 1515
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:11,053
