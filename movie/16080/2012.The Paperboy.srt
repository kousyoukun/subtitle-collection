1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,555
You just tell me when you're rolling.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,949
We're rolling.

3
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:11,917
A lot of people--

4
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:15,622
have questioned what really happened.

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,125
And when the novel was first published,

6
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:21,361
it didn't take long

7
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:25,031
for there to be even more questions asked.

8
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:27,534
It's always remained a mystery.

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,136
And that's why I wanted to thank you

10
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:32,539
for coming in to meet with us.

11
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:38,813
To help shed some light on the events.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,715
Okay.

13
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:43,651
He dedicated the book to you.

14
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:45,786
Can you tell us how much of his novel

15
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:47,188
was based on fact?

16
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,290
All of it.

17
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:50,992
It was 1969--

18
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:59,034
What can you tell us about that summer?

19
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:04,573
Question? What was the question?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,142
What do you remember about that summer 1969?

21
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:08,878
It was hot. It was real hot.

22
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,313
God must have been sweatin', it was so hot.

23
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,589
Tell me about the murder.

24
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:26,296
Hey, how much, how much I'm gettin' paid for this?

25
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,139
Well, Sheriff Call was this evil, nasty,

26
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:38,275
disgusting son of a gun.

27
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:49,588
Black people hated Sheriff Call

28
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:51,889
because he killed so many of us

29
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:54,326
during his two terms in service.

30
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:06,137
Some of my family was included.

31
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,307
White people feared him too.

32
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:18,451
So somebody got fed up with his fat ass, and killed him.

33
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,320
That's what happened that summer.

34
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:53,021
They say he dragged his intestines

35
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,089
for a mile before he died.

36
00:02:57,426 --> 00:03:00,762
Crazy white people even built a statue for him.

37
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:05,266
How did it come about

38
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,736
that you worked for the Jansens?

39
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:09,972
I was cleaning for them part time,

40
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,708
right when his mamma ran off.

41
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,111
And Ward and I, Ward was his brother,

42
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:18,347
he was in high school at the time

43
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,382
and we raised him together.

44
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:23,186
Little Jackie was five at the time.

45
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,955
Where was his father?

46
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,592
W. W. was just

47
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,260
chasing girls, you know.

48
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,562
And running the local newspaper.

49
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,468
The Moat County Tribune.

50
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:39,202
How's Ward?

51
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,707
He's good, he's good. Real busy.

52
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,675
Ward was a writer--

53
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:49,914
uh--for the Miami Times.

54
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:53,351
He used to write about, uh--

55
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,586
well, he was kind of famous, you know,

56
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:59,657
'cause he wrote about the Civil Rights Movement

57
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:04,029
and the poor and the unjustly accused.

58
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,764
That's how come that lady Charlotte

59
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,767
started writing letters to him.

60
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,003
Stuff like that.

61
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,838
Yeah.

62
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:16,175
And then Jack, like I said, he was a swimmer.

63
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,644
And, uh--

64
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,445
almost professional, very close but then

65
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:22,115
he got kicked off the swim team,

66
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,584
he got kicked out of college,

67
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:27,520
and he came back home to his papa's house to deliver newspapers.

68
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:31,457
He didn't want to come back home,

69
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:33,126
but he didn't have nowhere else to go.

70
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,500
# Yeah #

71
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,536
# Mmm #

72
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,538
Jack, you better turn that music down.

73
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,740
You know W. W. gon' be mad at you.

74
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:52,813
Dang it, Anita, can you please knock?

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,282
I could've been jerking off in here.

76
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:59,386
Please, it ain't nothing I ain't seen before.

77
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:01,188
What are you doing?

78
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,358
I'm picking up your stuff, like I do every day.

79
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:06,661
Oh come on, not today. It's too hot for that.

80
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:08,797
I'm just helping.

81
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:10,832
You're not helping me. You don't have to help me.

82
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,301
Come on.

83
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,869
Get off the bed so I can make it.

84
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,170
Go fix me some collard greens.

85
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:16,739
It's my bed.

86
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,941
I know it's your bed. Really?

87
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:21,911
Because it's your bed, you should fucking make it.

88
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,747
They cancelled "The Smothers Brothers."

89
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,983
Oh, no, that's your show.

90
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:30,353
Well, I love that show. I love Dick and I love Tommy.

91
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,690
Lay down. Let me be you for a second. Oh, yeah, right. Get me in trouble.

92
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:38,328
You want to be me, I get to be you? Okay.

93
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:41,565
Okay, I'll love this. Jack, may I come in?

94
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,268
Oh, good, okay. Go away, go out. Go back out.

95
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:49,673
Okay. I better start jerking off first. Okay.

96
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,876
Jack, sorry to interrupt your masturbation,

97
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:53,877
but I'm here to clean the bed!

98
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:55,812
I could've been jerking off. I'm gonna clean everything!

99
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,782
I could have been jerking off!

100
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,783
Get out! Clean my shit up!

101
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,587
...get all that we have received in return,

102
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,190
is just another smooth exercise

103
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:07,425
in political manipulation. Good girl.

104
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,527
Deceit and deception,

105
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,997
callousness and indifference to our individual problems,

106
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:16,402
and the disgusting playing of divisive politics,

107
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:19,071
pitting the young against the old,

108
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:22,641
labor against management, north against south.

109
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,910
Did you want to see me?

110
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,746
Have you spoken to Ward this week?

111
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:29,949
No. Hello, Jack.

112
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,252
He didn't mention anything to you about coming here?

113
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,022
I can't believe your father's making me report on this.

114
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,058
I mean, look at her.

115
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:40,092
... to open our society.

116
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,762
She plans to run for president next.

117
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,067
They want to talk to Hillary Van Wetter.

118
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:49,336
Don't you let that Pulitzer Prize fool you.

119
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,206
He don't know everything yet.

120
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,944
Ain't no reason to come up here

121
00:06:57,011 --> 00:07:00,013
stirring up shit with that asshole.

122
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,651
I just wanted to say that it is very important

123
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:05,820
for all Americans to recognize--

124
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,223
Charlotte Bless loved her some dangerous men.

125
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,026
She wrote men in prison.

126
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:12,728
She finally fell in love with one.

127
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:14,862
She was determined to get him out.

128
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:16,899
Why y'all ain't got no ice in here?

129
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,700
You want ice, go to your house.

130
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,601
Charlotte.

131
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,604
Oh, that's my show. What you think, Charlotte?

132
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:24,206
I don't like it. Make it looser.

133
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:25,909
That's that nigger you've been writing?

134
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,876
No. This is my white man.

135
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:29,511
Ohhh.

136
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:33,049
What happened yesterday? I missed it.

137
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:35,184
Listen to this. He thinks I'm his angel.

138
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,755
His angel? Shhh. Shut your face.

139
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:41,558
Bitch, how old is he? Oh, my God.

140
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:45,328
He's a fine motherfucker that's trying to fuck you. "Ever there was an angel in the world,

141
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,363
"my angel, it must be you,

142
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,168
but no angel would do the things I dream that you want."

143
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:54,737
Your angel, his angel.

144
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:57,174
Mm-hm. That's hot.

145
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:02,847
He say, "If you truly exist, I may become a religious man."

146
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,281
Ah!

147
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,123
"All my life, my heart has tried to find a place

148
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,829
I cannot name...a home."

149
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:20,131
You need to find yourself a young one.

150
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:21,700
He'll fuck you real good.

151
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,205
He says I'm his home. Hm.

152
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,906
Got a hundred different men

153
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,841
writing her from the penitentiary.

154
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,210
That's her man.

155
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,779
Oh, no. This is my man.

156
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,583
This here's the one.

157
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,118
Mm-hm.

158
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,524
Ward came home to investigate

159
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,027
the conviction of Hillary Van Wetter.

160
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,495
The town wasn't too happy about it

161
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,932
and neither was his papa. Oh, shit. Ugh.

162
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,939
Ward--

163
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,375
there's a horse in the parking lot.

164
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,644
It's our ride home, Yardley.

165
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,315
Uh, where is everybody?

166
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:09,416
It's Sunday.

167
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,853
People's either at home or at church.

168
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:21,095
It's a shithole.

169
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:34,542
Hey, man.

170
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:38,781
Hey, you.

171
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:42,184
How you doing?

172
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:44,019
Jack, meet Yardley Acheman. Hey.

173
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:46,556
My little brother, Jack. The swimmer, right?

174
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:51,094
Yeah, he's our driver now. Right, good.

175
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,430
Here, let me get these.

176
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,667
That's my typewriter. You've gotten big, boy.

177
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,302
Just be careful with the typewriter.

178
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:02,572
Got all pumped up. Is that from swimming?

179
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,574
Not anymore.

180
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:13,618
No! No! No!

181
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,953
Yardley's real particular about his suits

182
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,955
and his typewriter. Well, it's very expensive.

183
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,961
Yes. Thank you.

184
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:29,100
How do I get in?

185
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:33,372
Watch your head. Watch your head.

186
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:36,842
Don't touch my head. Tell him where you're from, Yardley.

187
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,746
London.

188
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:41,614
Ah!

189
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,916
When I came here-- from New York,

190
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:47,353
I was interviewing for the job--

191
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,123
and I was in advertising in New York

192
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,427
and I mentioned that it was simply different in New York.

193
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:01,335
So how'd you get from New York City

194
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:04,170
to the metropolis of Lately, Florida?

195
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,875
Jansen residence.

196
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:12,279
So I came down South and I interviewed at the paper.

197
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:14,883
W.W., Miss Roberta's on the phone.

198
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,884
No, no, no.

199
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,586
We don't take phone calls. Anita...

200
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:20,188
Who's Miss Roberta? No calls, Anita.

201
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,029
What part of London you from, Yardley?

202
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:32,067
Um, all over London.

203
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,436
Is there a good dry cleaning here? Excuse me?

204
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:37,105
Dry cleaning.

205
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:39,174
Dry cleaning? Yes.

206
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,111
You ain't gonna eat that, are you? Uh-uh.

207
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,847
How you gonna win those swimming meets if you don't eat?

208
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,984
I'm retired.

209
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,355
Retired. Jack, you ain't even tired enough to be retired.

210
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:59,997
How is it exactly you guys work?

211
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:04,066
I mean, like that boy drowned at his initiation?

212
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,071
Well, Yardley's the writer--

213
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,876
And I'd guess you'd say Ward is the nuts and bolts.

214
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:14,879
Yeah. When I was a reporter,

215
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:17,147
we had rewrite men who took the stories over the phone.

216
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,350
No, no, no. I'm not a rewrite man.

217
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,152
I'm the writer.

218
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:24,322
I'm the one who puts the facts into perspective.

219
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:26,057
Oh!

220
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,593
Yes. It's a different world now, Mr. Jansen.

221
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,132
Clearly.

222
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,134
Times have changed a bit, sir.

223
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:38,036
What interest does "The Miami Times"

224
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,673
have in Hillary Van Wetter?

225
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,341
He murdered somebody in jail?

226
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,543
Even if he was guilty--

227
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,046
It was a lynching, pure and simple. --he had certain rights.

228
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:49,149
And even if he was guilty--

229
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:52,585
Hillary has rights that the process completely disregarded.

230
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:55,422
And that's why we're here.

231
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:58,791
I'm very sorry, everybody, but I'm going to have to leave.

232
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:00,861
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

233
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:03,295
I have early evaluations first thing in the morning.

234
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,798
Come here, sugar. I apologize.

235
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,001
All right, buddy.

236
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,404
Ward?

237
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:12,639
Good night, boys.

238
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,077
Ward?

239
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:22,517
Seems mighty sure of himself for a colored.

240
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:29,424
Ward said they need a driver.

241
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:31,025
A driver?

242
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,227
What you do out there?

243
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:36,098
So you meet anybody new out there in Miami?

244
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,303
I met a few.

245
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,673
Oh, yeah. All types down there, you know?

246
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,375
You stay away from those rough ones.

247
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,343
Remember what happened the last time.

248
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:51,580
How your kids?

249
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,415
You look beautiful, babe.

250
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:56,452
They're doing good. They're doing really good.

251
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,287
As soon as I get out of here,

252
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:02,559
I'll go see them and make dinner all over again.

253
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,596
You should come to that dinner, too.

254
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,099
I'll come to that dinner.

255
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:14,271
I think Ellen is maybe number four--

256
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:15,840
since you left.

257
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,009
Yeah.

258
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,145
That's why I don't take them bitches too seriously.

259
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:24,748
They come and they go and they come and they go.

260
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:27,151
You know what I mean?

261
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:31,722
# At last My dreams come true #

262
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:35,160
# Today he said "I do" #

263
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:38,429
# Friends said It couldn't be done #

264
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:42,200
# But all his love I know I've won #

265
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,603
How you doing there, Yard? Oh, jeez.

266
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:49,775
# That's where he placed The wedding band #

267
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:55,715
Hey, close that door, boy.

268
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,916
I don't want your daddy screaming about all the flies

269
00:14:57,983 --> 00:14:59,385
getting in the house.

270
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:01,621
Hmm.

271
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,624
Who is that, Jack?

272
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:05,758
Uh--

273
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:12,632
I'm looking for the office of Mr. Jansen.

274
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,668
Ward Jansen of "The Miami Times."

275
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:17,204
I said who is it? I work for the Times.

276
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,805
You do? Yeah.

277
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:21,942
Huh.

278
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:25,212
Well, I'm Charlotte Bless. I'm Jack Jansen.

279
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,314
Here, let me get that. Oh.

280
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,951
Hey. All my files.

281
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:32,920
The office is in the garage.

282
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:35,924
You look a little young to be a journalist.

283
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,726
I'm really just the driver. Oh.

284
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,862
But I do write.

285
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:44,766
So do I. I write letters. I'm pretty good.

286
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,471
Hey, guys!

287
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:51,206
This here is Miss Charlotte Bless.

288
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:53,107
Oh, not for long.

289
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:55,177
Hillary and I are engaged to be married.

290
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,112
Hello, Miss Bless. I'm Ward.

291
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,915
Oh, Mr. Ward, good to finally meet you.

292
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:02,751
You didn't mention the engagement in your letters. Go clean yourself up.

293
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:05,120
Well, it only just happened. He just proposed.

294
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:07,623
Oh, that looks nasty. Well, how did I do that?

295
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,860
Excuse me a second.

296
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,194
Get Miss Bless something to drink. I'm Yardley Acheman.

297
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,097
We thought you and Hillary hadn't met.

298
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,699
Well, only in pictures,

299
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:17,434
but we been writing each other for months

300
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,436
and we understand ourselves just perfect.

301
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:21,338
Ward, where should I put her files?

302
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,274
Everything you need to know about Van Wetter

303
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:24,474
that's been in the papers,

304
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,209
is here in these boxes.

305
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,613
Our exciting correspondence is in that box.

306
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,381
In case you're interested.

307
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,518
My desk, Jackie boy.

308
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:42,326
Mr. Jansen, I really just wanted to thank you.

309
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,329
I wanted to thank you for returning my letters.

310
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:47,198
And for helping me get Hillary out of that hellhole.

311
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,434
Well, I wouldn't go booking the honeymoon just yet.

312
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:51,003
But we are going to fight his sentence

313
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,838
and the way it came about.

314
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,907
Thank you. Thank you so much.

315
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,578
Nobody deserves the death penalty, Miss Bless.

316
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,847
Not even Hillary Van Wetter.

317
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:05,751
Um, excuse me. So, everything is ordered alphabetically.

318
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,321
I was telling, um-- what's your name?

319
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:09,656
Yardley. Yardley.

320
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:12,759
Um, that all of the files,

321
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,261
Um, everything that's been in the papers,

322
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:18,598
is in the top box. This is gonna be a great help.

323
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,867
He's an innocent man. You're gonna find that out.

324
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,703
Wrongly convicted.

325
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,371
This is gonna get us off to a great start.

326
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:26,739
I've done a lot of research. I see that.

327
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:29,243
In the meantime, you need to freshen up or anything?

328
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,847
Jack, show Miss Bless to the washroom. I think I'll just stay here.

329
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:35,316
You might have some questions that you need answered.

330
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:36,884
I can freshen up just here.

331
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,920
Cold beer for me, Jack.

332
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:41,789
You're adorable, Jack.

333
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:43,692
I will take an iced tea if you have it.

334
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,492
You want anything, Ward? I'm good.

335
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,529
You'll see, uh--

336
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:49,931
it's an enormous amount of work-- What's with the boxes?

337
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:53,535
I don't know what to do here. What's with the boxes?

338
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:55,737
Well, we're gonna start on it.

339
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:59,274
My Jack was in love with Charlotte Bless.

340
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,042
I could tell that horny little boy

341
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:03,579
wanted to jump her on first sight.

342
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:08,618
Everybody was confused why she was engaged to Hillary Van Wetter.

343
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:11,987
Nasty, white trash swamp.

344
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:14,390
"All the killers who have written me

345
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:17,561
want to press their mouths into my vagina

346
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,596
and some, even the crack of my behind,

347
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,300
except Hillary Van Wetter.

348
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:27,471
He has no such desire.

349
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:30,674
He wants to be sucked off himself.

350
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:33,944
I consider this psychological proof of his innocence. "

351
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:38,516
She is one nasty little nut job.

352
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,118
Think we've been taking her a little too seriously.

353
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:43,288
You sure get bored quick.

354
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,323
No. Can tell I'm not going to get laid anytime soon

355
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,326
in this Floridian shit pit, so--

356
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,528
Listen-- Hey, Kathy, it's me.

357
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,530
Hillary tells her that the knife

358
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,666
Yardley. and the bloodied shirt

359
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:57,236
that the deputies claim to have found in his house

360
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,405
somehow got lost before the trial.

361
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:02,474
Yeah, I miss you, too.

362
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,310
What?

363
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,845
Hello, Kathy.

364
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,984
Miss Bless wanted to look at the prison.

365
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,620
Jack's first assignment was to take her there.

366
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,724
I bet he knows I'm here.

367
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,792
See, people who fall in love outside--

368
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,829
of a normal relationship,

369
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:28,668
they have these powers-- telepathic powers.

370
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,838
Hillary and I have that kind of connection, you dig?

371
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,150
Now why ain't you in college?

372
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:44,886
Huh?

373
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,889
Uh, I was a swimmer when I was in school.

374
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,690
No kidding? Yeah.

375
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,859
I was a swimmer. You were?

376
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,794
Uh-huh. I'd swim like a mermaid

377
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,533
if it wasn't for my damn curly hair.

378
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,600
I think straight hair gives me class.

379
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,337
All right.

380
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:04,540
Good.

381
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:08,076
So?

382
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:10,879
Well, we was drunk one night, and, uh--

383
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:16,218
I just--

384
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:18,221
I lost my temper and just--

385
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,590
well, I emptied the pool.

386
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:23,126
At your college?

387
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:24,727
The University of Florida.

388
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:30,767
They called that vandalism, I guess.

389
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,236
It's actually not as easy to do as it sounds.

390
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:36,740
So you lose your temper often?

391
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,213
Mm.

392
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,881
This place is full of boys just like you

393
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,649
who lost their temper one day.

394
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,058
I'm getting horny being this close to him.

395
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:55,659
Oh, baby.

396
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:59,997
I bet he's horny for me all the time.

397
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,634
Yeah.

398
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,668
Mmm.

399
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:08,306
Oh, I can feel him.

400
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:13,745
Can I help you folks?

401
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,180
Oh, no.

402
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:21,119
Yes, Officer. Uh--hm.

403
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:24,123
We just wanted to sit in your parking lot for a little while.

404
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:26,259
What for?

405
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:28,828
His daddy's in there and we wanted to send him good vibrations.

406
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:30,963
Some good what?

407
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,701
Oh, these special things called good vibrations.

408
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,573
Sorry, ma'am. Y'all can't park here.

409
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,973
Oh.

410
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,644
Yes, Officer.

411
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,821
The story that Hillary told the deputies

412
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:57,525
was never investigated.

413
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:00,295
He simply told it once from the witness stand

414
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:01,996
and was never asked to elaborate,

415
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:05,967
not even by his own lawyers.

416
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:20,482
Good to see you again, Ward. Nice to see you.

417
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:32,495
Sir, this is my writing partner, Mr. Yardley Acheman.

418
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:41,238
Of course.

419
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:43,273
I suppose the best place to start

420
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,041
would be the beginning.

421
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:46,744
I was born in this county.

422
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:51,249
1897, to poor but proud parents.

423
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:53,985
Mr. Pine, could we skip 65 years,

424
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:55,785
save everyone some time?

425
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:00,725
Hillary Van Wetter, 1965?

426
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,361
Oh, I can't agree to talk to you about that matter.

427
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:05,530
Not without my client's permission.

428
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:09,367
He's entitled to his privacy, just like anybody else.

429
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:12,204
You have his permission. He wrote you.

430
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:14,438
I'll have to check that out.

431
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,909
I'm sure the letters would be in your files, Mr. Pine.

432
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:19,111
That's what you say, but I have a client to protect.

433
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:23,515
Look here.

434
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,919
If we have to get a lawyer of our own down here

435
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:28,253
to sort this out, then while he's here,

436
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,992
we're gonna have him look through every aspect of Mr. Van Wetter's case.

437
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,627
Including the competency of his defense.

438
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:38,665
There was nothing wrong with the defense Hillary Van Wetter got in court!

439
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:41,235
Then you have nothing to worry about from us.

440
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:42,602
We just want to talk to him.

441
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,270
Then we'll be out of your--

442
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:46,073
You don't know a thing about this person!

443
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,678
You've been in this world for five minutes, boy!

444
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:53,948
Now that's just not necessary, Mr. Pine.

445
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:56,250
Yes. I talk the way I want in my office!

446
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:58,485
All right. Then you'll arrange the meeting, will you?

447
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:05,861
Quick! We're gonna be late!

448
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,632
You get the marriage license?

449
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,259
I can't believe we're doing this!

450
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:43,232
Fuck! Jack, go knock on the door again.

451
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,771
There she is. Whoa, baby

452
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,442
Well, I say-- Good morning, Miss Bless.

453
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,645
Look at Daisy Mae.

454
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,079
Morning.

455
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:57,247
You look just fine.

456
00:24:57,314 --> 00:24:58,715
Hope he likes it.

457
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:05,757
Uh--

458
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:07,825
Would you mind putting up the windows?

459
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:09,226
It's gonna muss my hair.

460
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:14,699
Are you serious?

461
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:16,935
I'm sweating like a pregnant nun back here.

462
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:20,539
Unbelievable!

463
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:38,291
Hi.

464
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:56,344
You got 15 minutes.

465
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,912
No physical contact of any kind.

466
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:59,814
No tape recorders.

467
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:01,550
No object may be passed to the prisoner.

468
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:02,917
I'll be right outside this door.

469
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:13,495
Mr. Van Wetter,

470
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:15,765
my name is Ward J ansen.

471
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:20,470
This is my associate, Yardley Acheman-- You look like your picture.

472
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:25,441
Mmm. I do?

473
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:27,477
Thank you.

474
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:31,447
These your paperboys?

475
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,586
Mm-hm.

476
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,387
What they gonna do for us?

477
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:41,692
They gonna save you.

478
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,826
They're gonna save us?

479
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,498
Mm-hm.

480
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:55,006
Shit. They can't even save themselves.

481
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,740
Mr. Van Wetter, we wanted to ask you

482
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,309
about the lost evidence in your case.

483
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,545
Shut up. Can't you see I'm busy?

484
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,119
Will you do something for me right now?

485
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:12,457
Oh. Oh, I wish I could.

486
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:20,399
Spread your legs open a little bit.

487
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:26,505
Mmm. Yeah.

488
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:28,507
Now tear off them pantyhose.

489
00:27:28,574 --> 00:27:30,309
Rip those off.

490
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:35,415
Yeah. Mm-hm.

491
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:37,383
Move your hands away. Mmm.

492
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:40,254
Yeah.

493
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,329
Now open up your mouth--

494
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:51,431
you picture what you wrote me in your letters.

495
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:33,642
You bitch!

496
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,508
Oh, I love you.

497
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,219
What the hell's going on in here?

498
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,455
You're a good girl. I warned y'all! This visit's over!

499
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,022
I told y'all this visit was-- come on!

500
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,458
Come on, Hillary. No!

501
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,727
No! There's nothing going on!

502
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,462
Shit! No!

503
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:27,032
What the fuck? I didn't touch that girl!

504
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,902
No! No!

505
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,936
What the fuck you laughing about?

506
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,976
Come on now, Miss Bless.

507
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:39,412
Jack came home and threw up after that.

508
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,214
He couldn't believe he still loved her

509
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,851
after what he saw, but he did.

510
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:47,153
You're Ward Ward's boy? Mm-hm.

511
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,291
Most contrary man in all of Moat County.

512
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:55,563
What may I do for you gentlemen today?

513
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,298
It's about the murder of Sheriff Call.

514
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,434
I understand that there's some physical evidence

515
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:02,636
relating to the case that was lost?

516
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:05,105
Yes, sir. I believe there was.

517
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,575
Well, we was wondering what sort of explanation

518
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:10,245
the department might have.

519
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:11,512
I wish I knew.

520
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:17,219
Mr. Van Wetter once cut a deputy's thumb off.

521
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,922
Did you know that?

522
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:24,093
It was over a traffic ticket, if I remember.

523
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,928
You can't do much without your thumb.

524
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:30,867
It's what separates us from the primates.

525
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:35,037
For a little thing like holding your wife's titty.

526
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:38,273
You're not married, Mr. Jansen? No.

527
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:44,014
A little thing like that, you can't do it.

528
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:48,050
Maybe I'll just go talk to the deputies

529
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:49,953
who was involved in the arrest.

530
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,787
You can talk to whoever you want

531
00:30:51,854 --> 00:30:54,224
as long as they'll talk to you. But they won't.

532
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,526
And why is that?

533
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,929
They haven't forgotten what Hillary did to one of theirs.

534
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:00,564
The judge allowed testimony

535
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:02,266
based on evidence that he never even saw.

536
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:04,235
He took the officer's word over Hillary's.

537
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:07,538
I can't say I blame him. Nobody does.

538
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,616
You got me in the face there.

539
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,627
So you've got to ask him.

540
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,763
Where was he between 2:00 and 6:00?

541
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:32,163
I'm gonna ask him about some things he wrote,

542
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,832
some letters to Charlotte.

543
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:40,472
H ere we go.

544
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:41,774
Hold.

545
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:45,878
Good morning, Mr. Van Wetter.

546
00:31:50,684 --> 00:31:51,951
Hey.

547
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:56,156
Where's your dress?

548
00:31:56,223 --> 00:31:58,326
You don't like me like this?

549
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:00,961
You know a prisoner by the name of--

550
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:02,529
Ward, Ward, Ward.

551
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:04,198
You know a prisoner by the name

552
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:06,700
of Mr. Bobby Valentine? Mr. Van Wetter?

553
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:09,370
Mr. Demarcus Williams, Mr. Bobby Hinton?

554
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:11,839
Another prisoner by the name of Jimmy Edwards,

555
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:14,075
another one, Demarcus.

556
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,210
I think his name is Curt. I forgot his last name.

557
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:18,447
Anyway, you know what they all have in common?

558
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:21,148
Hey, Martin Luther King.

559
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:23,185
You know what they all had in common? What?

560
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:25,786
They all wear pants.

561
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,990
Every goddamned man in here wears pants!

562
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:30,025
How am I supposed to tell you apart from them?

563
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:31,793
Don't talk to her like that! Sit down, Jack.

564
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,729
Sit the fuck down.

565
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:35,998
Mr. Van Wetter, we don't have a lot of time, all right?

566
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:37,833
We got to move on.

567
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,402
You're gonna move on one way or another, Ward?

568
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,638
Ward's in charge!

569
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:46,308
He's gonna get his way-- till he don't.

570
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:49,178
Maybe that's how he got his scars on the face.

571
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:55,151
You mentioned in one of your letters to Miss Bless

572
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:57,720
that you was working Turn around, bitch!

573
00:32:57,788 --> 00:33:00,023
An Uncle Tyree-- Yeah, yeah.

574
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:01,691
at the time of the murder.

575
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:02,760
What kind of work you doing? Lawn work.

576
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:04,461
Lawn work.

577
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:06,362
You wear a dress in here next time

578
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:09,066
or you don't bother coming! Bitch, look at me!

579
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:14,905
And stop bringing that fucking nigger

580
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,774
think he Muhammad Ali with you!

581
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,376
Mr. Van Wetter, come have a seat.

582
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:20,611
Cassius Clay, nigger.

583
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:22,313
We can get a dress here in five minutes.

584
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,582
Why don't you have a seat?

585
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:24,616
Go home, boy!

586
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,422
I don't know--

587
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:34,526
Charlotte, where does one get pants like that from anyway?

588
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:37,562
Well, I think we got the case licked.

589
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,198
This is a fucking circus!

590
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:46,538
In this town,

591
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,574
Weldon Pine helped get Sheriff Call re-elected.

592
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,743
Tension was brewing in the house.

593
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,946
Jack was getting jealous of Hillary and Charlotte.

594
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:59,685
And he was getting jealous of Ward and Yardley, too.

595
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:05,392
Ward wasn't somebody who attached himself to just anybody.

596
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:07,861
Your dad's girlfriend, what's her name?

597
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:10,764
Jack couldn't understand why he was so attached to that Yardley.

598
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:13,166
No, you didn't.

599
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:14,935
What is the hottest temperature

600
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,403
that you've ever been in?

601
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,939
125.

602
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,806
How about you?

603
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:21,942
Just put your hand out and it burns off

604
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,178
The hottest was when I lived in Florida. How about you?

605
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,847
It doesn't bother me. I never pay attention to it.

606
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:30,652
Cold and wet just goes fucking through you like a knife

607
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,721
but--I don't know.

608
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:37,993
So how's Mr. Van Wetter today? He still innocent?

609
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,528
I don't know. If he is--

610
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:43,799
he sure as hell didn't have no help proving it,

611
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,734
not from that Weldon Pine guy anyway.

612
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:48,370
Could I have a fork or something?

613
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:51,373
The chicken legs, you eat those with your hands.

614
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,176
Maybe at your house.

615
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:55,144
This is the South, sugar.

616
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:57,614
Anyway, you know how I feel about that.

617
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,816
Do you eat your mashed potatoes with your hands? Do you really want to--?

618
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:04,621
Do you really want to--? Bring me some chopsticks, Anita.

619
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,123
Do you really want to take the shot--

620
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,659
on putting to death a man or a woman

621
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:13,830
when maybe they're innocent? I mean, I don't.

622
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:17,468
I don't want to try to have to live with that.

623
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:21,371
On the other hand-- Are you gonna eat that or torture it?

624
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,874
Told you, I'm not hungry.

625
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,209
That's'cause you're in love.

626
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:27,278
I know who you're sniffing around, too.

627
00:35:27,345 --> 00:35:29,080
Anita, please don't tease him at the table.

628
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,015
On the other hand, if somebody's guilty,

629
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:35,019
well, you want to pay their room and board 365?

630
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:35,953
Absolutely. Ah!

631
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,589
Whoops.

632
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:40,259
I'm so sorry.

633
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:43,161
Anyway, it's just iced tea. It ain't even gonna stain.

634
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:48,767
You'da thought Jack woulda had a girlfriend by now,

635
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,769
but all he did was jerk off to the pictures

636
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:54,373
in those nudie magazines that was under his bed.

637
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:58,144
Now she was all he could think of night and day.

638
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:00,380
Oh, yeah, he was definitely in love.

639
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:04,817
He needed her.

640
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:07,221
What you reading? You give it to me.

641
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:10,423
What is this shit? " Lolita."

642
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,426
Porno, I bet.

643
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:17,731
Oh.

644
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,269
You need a girlfriend.

645
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:28,976
Look at them girls over there.

646
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:32,280
Go on and introduce yourself. Go on.

647
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:36,885
I'm just fine right here.

648
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,059
You want me to blow you, don't you?

649
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,561
You don't have to answer. I know it's true.

650
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:52,835
I'm not gonna blow a friendship--

651
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,270
over a stupid little blowjob.

652
00:36:58,274 --> 00:36:59,275
You hear me?

653
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,612
Look, why you talking to me like that?

654
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:06,650
See that one in blue? She'll blow you.

655
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:08,851
I don't want someone like that blowing me.

656
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:11,153
It's a good thing you're not in prison

657
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,023
because you wouldn't have a choice there.

658
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,763
Fuck you.

659
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:28,205
Jack, come back here.

660
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:31,509
# Well, well #

661
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:37,181
# I passed the corner Where we first met #

662
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:39,317
# Yes, I did #

663
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:43,621
# Memories of our love Linger there yet #

664
00:37:45,523 --> 00:37:48,893
# Oh, I'm sitting On top of the world #

665
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,566
# Just to know That you're my girl #

666
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:57,303
# I'm just lucky #

667
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:02,241
# I'm lucky, lucky, Lucky in love #

668
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,728
# Our love is here--#

669
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,737
# Lucky, lucky, lucky In love--#

670
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:44,952
# Oh, I'm sitting On top of the world #

671
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:47,789
# Just to know That she's my girl #

672
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:50,591
# That makes me lucky #

673
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,961
Oh my God. Pam.

674
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:55,463
# I'm so lucky lucky Lucky in love #

675
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:58,233
# Let me sing One more time ##

676
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,037
What is that? Is he okay?

677
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,604
Is he having an allergic reaction?

678
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:04,640
A jellyfish sting or something?

679
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:06,309
A fucking jellyfish did that.

680
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,311
You're supposed to piss on a jellyfish sting.

681
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,312
We're gonna have to do something embarrassing.

682
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:12,282
You got to hang in there. Hey!

683
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,150
Well, you're gonna-- You'll piss on him?

684
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:15,818
What are you doing to him?

685
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:17,487
Call an ambulance.

686
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:19,289
He's having a reaction! Shut the fuck up!

687
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:21,058
Don't push me! You're supposed to piss--

688
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:22,725
Get the fuck out of here! I can see this.

689
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,428
I can see he's poisoned. You don't pee on--

690
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,698
Don't push me! I will slap your face.

691
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,832
Get the fuck out of here. All right.

692
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:33,304
I said, I will kick your ass! I'm going to call the police.

693
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,139
Move it! Fine.

694
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,074
If anyone's gonna piss on him, it's gonna be me!

695
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,676
Fine, fuck you!

696
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,544
He don't like strangers peeing on him!

697
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,013
Come on. Come on.

698
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,081
Come on, baby come on! Wake up!

699
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,616
Come on! Shit!

700
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,452
# La la la #

701
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,257
# Zippeydoo da #

702
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:53,191
Come on.

703
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,460
Come on!

704
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:01,133
# No matter What people say #

705
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,636
# I know our love Is here to stay #

706
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:09,141
# And I'm so lucky #

707
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,475
You're gonna be okay!

708
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:13,312
# Lucky lucky in love #

709
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:16,816
# I'm mister lucky #

710
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:20,052
# I'm so lucky Lucky lucky in love ##

711
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,321
Jack.

712
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:22,788
What are you doing here?

713
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:25,324
What do you think I'm doing here?

714
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,328
Told you to knock on my door

715
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:29,396
before you come in my room.

716
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,898
Oh, hush up.

717
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:34,134
Here, I brought you something.

718
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,637
Take these pills.

719
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,871
I smell awful.

720
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,675
That's because that blond lady peed all over your face.

721
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:46,314
Ugh. Here, drink this.

722
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:47,749
Does it hurt?

723
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,688
I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm cold.

724
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:08,837
Congratulations, Jack. We're in the paper.

725
00:41:08,904 --> 00:41:13,275
"Fast action saves Lately man at beach.

726
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:15,211
"Miss Charlotte Bless of Mobile, Alabama

727
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:17,379
apparently saved Mr. Jansen's life

728
00:41:17,446 --> 00:41:19,515
by urinating over the areas of his body

729
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,718
where he was attacked.

730
00:41:21,785 --> 00:41:24,787
These included the victim's arms, genitals and face. "

731
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,489
Jack, I had no idea.

732
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:27,924
I had no idea that your own father

733
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:29,392
would print something like that.

734
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:31,027
It made the AP wire.

735
00:41:31,094 --> 00:41:34,965
You're famous all over the country.

736
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:39,069
"Home Remedy." Good title.

737
00:41:39,135 --> 00:41:42,273
What's Dad trying to do to me?

738
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,309
It's called the newspaper business, Jack.

739
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:50,414
Oh, shit.

740
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:55,921
Let him go, Jack! You're gonna kill him.

741
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:07,633
Jack, let him go.

742
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:16,342
You put your hands on me again,

743
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,843
I will fuck you up! Yeah?

744
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:20,079
Fuck you, nigger!

745
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:28,655
He needs to get laid.

746
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:31,057
He needs a fucking straitjacket.

747
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:32,725
He's sexually repressed.

748
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,561
Sexually repressed is a 40-year-old woman

749
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,530
who's obsessed with prison cock!

750
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,465
That's not nice. Calm down now.

751
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:41,201
No, fuck calm down!

752
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,470
I'm not having some kid call me a nigger.

753
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:44,604
I want him out of here now!

754
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:49,009
Yardley?

755
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:58,652
Jack, let's go to the prison.

756
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,488
You two can stay here and keep arguing.

757
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:02,324
This time I'm talking to Hillary by myself.

758
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,892
Come on.

759
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,627
He's not even gonna look at you

760
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:07,696
if I'm not there in a pretty dress.

761
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:09,732
Well, that's too bad for him.

762
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:11,333
Ward.

763
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:15,871
You'll see.

764
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:27,416
I knew Jack didn't mean to say it.

765
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,586
But those were the times we were living in

766
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:31,187
and it was what it was.

767
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:35,926
Yardley, on the other hand, well--

768
00:43:40,597 --> 00:43:44,034
# Get out of the cold #

769
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:47,838
# Take the night off #

770
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:51,842
# Be your own boss #

771
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:55,280
# When you're near me #

772
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,115
# Can you hear me #

773
00:43:57,181 --> 00:44:01,286
# Or do I have to shout In your ear #

774
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:02,654
# Mmm #

775
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,957
# Take the night off #

776
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:09,728
# Turn the light on #

777
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:12,230
# Take the night off #

778
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:14,967
# Turn the light on #

779
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:17,636
Forensic report says that the sheriff

780
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:20,205
was stabbed between 2 and 3 AM.

781
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:22,041
Yep. Like I told you,

782
00:44:22,107 --> 00:44:24,311
I was with-- my Uncle Tyree doing lawn work

783
00:44:24,377 --> 00:44:25,978
in Ormond Beach at the time.

784
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:28,247
Lawn work? Yes, sir.

785
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:30,150
You mean stealing? Yes, sir.

786
00:44:30,216 --> 00:44:32,217
Stealing sod off a golf course.

787
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:35,422
A developer paid through the teeth for that shit.

788
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:36,923
We sold it and we didn't make it back

789
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,691
to the river till sunrise.

790
00:44:38,757 --> 00:44:40,660
What kind of developers? Condominiums, man.

791
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:42,829
You got a name? No, I don't.

792
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:45,932
Deputies say they found the sheriff's body at 6 AM--

793
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:48,068
but it was the way he was killed.

794
00:44:51,172 --> 00:44:53,173
That's what makes everybody assume it was you.

795
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,177
What you think? You tell me.

796
00:44:56,244 --> 00:44:58,845
I ain't the only one carrying a machete around here.

797
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:02,650
True.

798
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:05,920
The deputies went to Tyree's house,

799
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:08,055
he said he'd been sleeping in bed all night

800
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,692
and had a whole bunch of family members there to confirm it.

801
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:13,761
Then they go to your house--

802
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:16,365
where they find the bloodstained shirt and knife.

803
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:18,799
Yeah, all right. Listen to me.

804
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,970
Every knife and shirt that I own is stained in blood.

805
00:45:22,037 --> 00:45:23,572
It's what I do for a living.

806
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,974
I'm gutting alligators for their skin.

807
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,809
Okay? I was a bachelor.

808
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:30,914
I didn't have nobody to do my laundry.

809
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,881
You probably got somebody to do your laundry.

810
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:33,983
What you think?

811
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:36,653
I bet you do.

812
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:42,225
They never matched the blood to the sheriff's, did they?

813
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:44,028
Tell me how to find Tyree.

814
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,835
The arms of mercy are so wide

815
00:45:52,902 --> 00:45:55,573
they will accept any man,

816
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:59,476
but they will not accept any man wearing pants.

817
00:45:59,543 --> 00:46:02,846
Where is my woman?

818
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,351
Where's my woman?

819
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:11,022
The only one you need to talk to right now is me, baby.

820
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:12,523
The only one I need to talk to?

821
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,159
I'm the only one. I'm your mercy.

822
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,261
I'm your arms wide open, I'm your pants.

823
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:20,498
Ward's in charge!

824
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:27,239
If you wanna go see Tyree, I'll give you directions,

825
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:30,776
but you got to make that choice because he's a violent man.

826
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:32,544
Now stay with me now

827
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:34,513
because this is when it gets tricky.

828
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,782
Ward called Charlotte

829
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:41,687
and told her to drive Yardley to Ormond Beach.

830
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:45,958
He wanted to verify Hillary's so-called golf course story.

831
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:49,062
The boys went on to visit this Uncle Tyree.

832
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:51,732
Man, this is stupid. Where are we going?

833
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:54,001
No one lives out here. No one could live out here.

834
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:58,640
You talk to Anita about your--choice of words?

835
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:02,476
It was fucked up.

836
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:05,979
I know.

837
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:18,928
Goddamn it.

838
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:20,428
Sure you don't me to watch the car?

839
00:47:22,263 --> 00:47:25,668
Goddamn it! This stuff ain't working, man.

840
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:27,669
It's like they like this shit.

841
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,171
Better than jellyfish, I bet.

842
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:32,974
Fuck! Oh, my God!

843
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,077
Watch it! You're way too close to him. Ward! Ward!

844
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:38,047
You better jump him.

845
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:40,182
It's better in here where we have to get lower.

846
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,622
Ward, you're sinking!

847
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,325
This whole place is just floating.

848
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,537
You ever think about Mama?

849
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,713
I wonder where she at.

850
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:15,786
She is in Tucson, Arizona.

851
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:23,328
You got a girlfriend?

852
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:31,336
Why?

853
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:43,750
You don't remember this, but Mom used to go on about, uh--

854
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:47,252
don't make love to a woman until you get married, right? Mm-hm.

855
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:53,093
I followed that until I was--

856
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,766
Oh, fuck that. We'll talk about it later.

857
00:48:58,832 --> 00:48:59,934
Let's go.

858
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,345
Mr. Van Wetter?

859
00:49:15,382 --> 00:49:17,351
Good afternoon, sir.

860
00:49:17,418 --> 00:49:19,688
My name is Ward Jansen. I work for "The Miami Times. "

861
00:49:19,754 --> 00:49:22,356
We're here on behalf here of your nephew, Hillary.

862
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,595
You lost a shoe.

863
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,566
You're lucky it was just the one.

864
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,402
Snakes all around here.

865
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:37,472
We need to talk to you about your nephew, Mr. Van Wetter.

866
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,209
Little late for that, isn't it?

867
00:49:41,276 --> 00:49:43,479
He gonna be strapped to a chair and electrocuted.

868
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:45,381
Well--

869
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:48,150
you come all the way up here just to tell me that?

870
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:49,885
You could've saved yourself a trip.

871
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:52,388
He tells me that he was with you

872
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,423
the night Sheriff Call was murdered,

873
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,325
stealing sod, which you later sold.

874
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,897
Let's hope nobody believes him.

875
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:04,001
Stealing's against the law, ain't it?

876
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,836
Now he's still got time.

877
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,644
I don't much care for you.

878
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,045
Come up here in my home--

879
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,180
and call me a thief.

880
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:23,855
I ain't up here about thieving, Mr. Van Wetter.

881
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:28,593
I'm up here about whether a man's life needs to be taken or not--

882
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,528
for the murder of Sheriff Call.

883
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,772
But if you was with your nephew that night,

884
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:42,040
it's vital for Hillary that you admit it.

885
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:45,544
I don't think he likes you much.

886
00:50:45,611 --> 00:50:47,046
I don't like him much either.

887
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,454
Where's the ice cream?

888
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:56,989
It's coming.

889
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:58,558
Keep that baby quiet.

890
00:51:01,193 --> 00:51:02,996
What's wrong with that baby?

891
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:06,533
All right, well, sit on it.

892
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:14,075
Yeah.

893
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:20,815
You want--?

894
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,851
You want a little ice cream?

895
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:29,190
You don't want to have any ice cream.

896
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:31,492
You take this chair out here with me.

897
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:37,065
No sense you staying over there.

898
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,269
Thank you.

899
00:51:40,335 --> 00:51:42,337
Little man, get yourself a chair there.

900
00:51:42,404 --> 00:51:43,438
Get yourself a chair.

901
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:49,344
Was you with him?

902
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:50,913
Yeah.

903
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:54,884
Well, I--

904
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,218
I was with him.

905
00:51:58,054 --> 00:51:59,055
Where?

906
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,693
Golf club.

907
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,561
Ormond Beach.

908
00:52:08,198 --> 00:52:10,800
Stole sod, sold it--

909
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,071
to this one condo developer.

910
00:52:15,572 --> 00:52:17,274
Where's Hillary live from here?

911
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:19,577
We didn't get back till the morning, sunrise.

912
00:52:22,446 --> 00:52:23,847
He lives that way.

913
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:25,749
So why are you telling me now?

914
00:52:28,153 --> 00:52:31,723
You seem like the only person thinks Hillary's innocent.

915
00:52:33,658 --> 00:52:36,995
No, sir, Mr. Van Wetter. No, sir.

916
00:52:37,062 --> 00:52:38,330
I didn't say that.

917
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:41,801
Your boy--

918
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,203
he's getting nervous over there.

919
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,139
Let's go. I'm done talking to you.

920
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:51,209
What you hiding? Ward?

921
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:52,578
I'm sick--

922
00:52:52,645 --> 00:52:54,480
of your questions.

923
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:58,284
Eugene?

924
00:53:05,424 --> 00:53:09,095
Ward, remember the first day when I was with Charlotte? Yeah?

925
00:53:09,161 --> 00:53:10,696
We went and stopped at the prison.

926
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:13,867
We didn't go in. I saw him.

927
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:15,935
Tyree? Yeah.

928
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,639
What you think? They was getting their stories together?

929
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:20,040
I don't know.

930
00:53:21,174 --> 00:53:22,609
I'll tell you this.

931
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:23,977
They ain't as dumb as they look.

932
00:53:27,715 --> 00:53:29,449
Oh, shit, man.

933
00:53:31,386 --> 00:53:32,387
Fuck.

934
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:42,964
What the fuck, man?

935
00:53:44,632 --> 00:53:46,335
Leave me at the fucking hotel?

936
00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:47,937
Jesus!

937
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,404
In Yardley's room, no less.

938
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,638
Fuck, man. Look at you.

939
00:53:54,076 --> 00:53:57,146
You're becoming obsessed with this case.

940
00:53:57,212 --> 00:53:58,814
Wake me up.

941
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:02,985
Wake me up.

942
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:04,520
Come on.

943
00:54:04,587 --> 00:54:06,323
You look terrible, Ward.

944
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:09,358
Those mosquitoes eat you for breakfast?

945
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:11,695
Yardley found the golf course.

946
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:14,598
You found the golf course? What's he doing in my clothes?

947
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:18,268
The car broke down.

948
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:20,003
we had to walk into town,

949
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,340
stopped by the motel to freshen up.

950
00:54:23,406 --> 00:54:25,842
Get out of my clothes now.

951
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:32,450
Come on.

952
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:34,018
Come on, Jack.

953
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:37,021
What are you doing?

954
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:38,856
Miss Bless. Come on, stop it.

955
00:54:38,923 --> 00:54:40,091
Jack!

956
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:44,762
On the morning of the murder

957
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:47,032
the grounds superintendent of the Ormond Beach Golf Course

958
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,533
phoned the Police Department

959
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,034
to report that four of his greens

960
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:51,703
had been stripped in the night.

961
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,472
You talked to the superintendent? No.

962
00:54:53,538 --> 00:54:55,474
He died, but I found another guy who remembered

963
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,976
that the club called the governor

964
00:54:58,043 --> 00:54:59,978
to ask him to declare them a disaster area

965
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:01,881
so they could get federal funds

966
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,049
to replace the greens.

967
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:04,750
It gets better.

968
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:06,486
I found the builder, too,

969
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:08,087
the guy who bought the stolen greens.

970
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:10,222
He remembered Hillary and Tyree.

971
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:12,558
They showed up at 6 AM in a truck.

972
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,761
He took one look at them and what they had

973
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:18,998
and thought they'd stolen it from a cemetery.

974
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,802
But of course, he doesn't want to be connected to this in any way.

975
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:24,437
And who was he?

976
00:55:24,504 --> 00:55:26,240
Well, the only way he'd talk to me

977
00:55:26,307 --> 00:55:27,841
is if I promised to keep him anonymous.

978
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,577
Come on now. What's his name?

979
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:31,445
No, no, no.

980
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:33,447
I've got to keep it anonymous. I gave him my word.

981
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:35,249
He's got, well, he's in a position

982
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:38,452
to get some work from the state, so you know.

983
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:41,189
But good, huh?

984
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:42,691
Outstanding.

985
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,796
How'd you find him?

986
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:50,197
Building permits.

987
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:55,036
Damn building permit.

988
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:00,442
Time to get out of Lately.

989
00:56:02,278 --> 00:56:03,678
Did you sleep with Yardley?

990
00:56:06,048 --> 00:56:08,384
You know, people like Yardley, you just--

991
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:14,490
got to get him on your side.

992
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:15,892
You know what I mean?

993
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,729
You fucked him for that?

994
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:27,237
Fucking a man is the most natural thing in the world, Jack.

995
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,572
It is.

996
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:31,575
It is.

997
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:38,749
I kind of like it out here.

998
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,657
This was a good idea.

999
00:56:49,594 --> 00:56:50,762
Oooh!

1000
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:52,997
Come on! Let's dance.

1001
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:58,102
Come on! No!

1002
00:56:58,169 --> 00:57:01,273
Come on, Jack. Got to have fun!

1003
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:08,213
You wanna dance?

1004
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,784
Yeah! I wanna dance with you!

1005
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,791
Woo! You're good!

1006
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:30,304
This is not me apologizing, you dig?

1007
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:32,539
I just don't like to see you sad.

1008
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:47,989
Yardley told their editor about the new evidence

1009
00:57:48,055 --> 00:57:50,425
from Ormond Beach.

1010
00:57:50,492 --> 00:57:53,594
This was enough to show injustice in the legal system of Lately

1011
00:57:53,661 --> 00:57:55,597
and enough for a good story.

1012
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:58,099
Yardley wanted to get out of town

1013
00:57:58,165 --> 00:57:59,667
and Ward knew it.

1014
00:58:06,642 --> 00:58:10,413
All these peanuts on the floor.

1015
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,682
Pigs. Bunch of pigs living around here.

1016
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:18,053
Sick of this shit.

1017
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,423
I can't find Mama's ring.

1018
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,193
Oh, well, a nigger must have come

1019
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,329
in the middle of the night and stole it.

1020
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:36,907
I'm sorry, Anita.

1021
00:58:36,974 --> 00:58:39,175
I didn't mean to say--

1022
00:58:40,945 --> 00:58:43,147
I didn't mean to say that.

1023
00:58:43,213 --> 00:58:44,849
And I'm really sorry.

1024
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:49,620
You know, Jackie, you got to watch your mouth.

1025
00:58:49,687 --> 00:58:53,190
Somebody'll cut your little ass over some shit like that.

1026
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:58,063
You understand me, boy?

1027
00:58:58,129 --> 00:58:59,163
Yes, ma'am.

1028
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:06,338
And you miss your mother?

1029
00:59:07,973 --> 00:59:10,176
Sometimes.

1030
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,978
It's a dis-damn grace the way she left you.

1031
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,317
And I been here.

1032
00:59:23,155 --> 00:59:25,092
Well, let's find this ring, I guess.

1033
00:59:25,158 --> 00:59:27,760
No, that's all right. I can find it.

1034
00:59:49,016 --> 00:59:50,385
Ohhh. Sorry.

1035
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:51,753
All right.

1036
00:59:53,453 --> 00:59:54,622
Okay.

1037
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:57,358
I'm really sorry. Okay.

1038
00:59:58,526 --> 01:00:01,462
All right, Jack.

1039
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:03,798
What's makes this story any different?

1040
01:00:03,865 --> 01:00:06,567
What makes your story different than the others, John?

1041
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:09,738
What makes this case so different that you want to pull the plug now?

1042
01:00:09,805 --> 01:00:11,540
The facts. What's left to do?

1043
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:13,207
You've been up there a month and a half.

1044
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:14,877
I want your ass back here.

1045
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,879
Save that shit for someone else.

1046
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,213
I'm not comfortable with it and you shouldn't be either.

1047
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:20,983
I'm going to Ormond Beach to get the facts.

1048
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:26,655
I want to get some alligator shoes.

1049
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:29,926
You run this article, this shit could hurt me.

1050
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,228
I got advertisers to think of.

1051
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,265
A dvertisers? You want me to be concerned

1052
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:37,434
with the advertisers for your newspaper?

1053
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,902
Ward, you don't know everything.

1054
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,403
He knows what he's doing, Pa.

1055
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,238
Shut up! I'm not talking to you.

1056
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,175
He knows how to get stories,

1057
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,276
but what he doesn't fully appreciate

1058
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,280
is that the stories go out into a community.

1059
01:00:49,347 --> 01:00:50,581
They resonate.

1060
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,350
Oh, like the jellyfish?

1061
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,852
Like getting pissed on?

1062
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:57,955
You notice Anita's been acting mighty bossy recently?

1063
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:02,793
She's always been that way. Yeah.

1064
01:01:05,264 --> 01:01:07,531
Oh, shit.

1065
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:10,202
Darling, let it go. Don't get yourself hurt.

1066
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:12,803
Sit down. I'll get Anita. Anita!

1067
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,107
Hey, I'll take care of it.

1068
01:01:15,173 --> 01:01:18,343
Anita will get it. Anita! Does she have children? I can't remember.

1069
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:23,950
She got two kids. Oh, yeah.

1070
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:29,555
How you doing, baby doll? Where you going?

1071
01:01:29,622 --> 01:01:31,491
Hoo. A baby shower.

1072
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:33,659
Um, Anita, uh, before you go,

1073
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:35,662
could you clean up this mess.

1074
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,997
I said I got it. It's all right. Anita's got it.

1075
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:42,735
I got it.

1076
01:01:43,736 --> 01:01:45,139
I got it.

1077
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:46,940
We're going to Ormond Beach.

1078
01:01:47,006 --> 01:01:50,411
Oh, just come right out and tell them.

1079
01:01:50,477 --> 01:01:53,847
I've named Ellen editor-in-chief.

1080
01:01:57,885 --> 01:02:00,254
And--

1081
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:01,522
we're getting married.

1082
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:13,500
It's an antique.

1083
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,770
I know it is.

1084
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:19,275
This belonged to my mother.

1085
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:22,110
It was a gift from me. Give it back, Jack.

1086
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:24,513
Just give it back to her.

1087
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,616
It's all I got.

1088
01:02:26,681 --> 01:02:28,784
Ward never believed Yardley's story.

1089
01:02:28,851 --> 01:02:30,820
Building permits and anonymous sources.

1090
01:02:30,886 --> 01:02:33,556
He took Charlotte and Jack back to Ormond Beach

1091
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:35,558
to get to the bottom of it.

1092
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,627
Yardley went back home to Miami.

1093
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:39,863
# That man is dangerous #

1094
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:44,034
# Loving him is dangerous #

1095
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,404
# That man is dangerous #

1096
01:02:50,807 --> 01:02:52,576
# Loving him is dangerous #

1097
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:57,047
# That man is dangerous #

1098
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,651
What is that builder's name, Charlotte?

1099
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:02,586
What builder?

1100
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,656
You know exactly what builder.

1101
01:03:04,722 --> 01:03:07,090
The one Yardley says bought the sod.

1102
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:08,493
I don't know. He went alone.

1103
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,529
I went to the hairdresser's.

1104
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:13,264
Takes a lot to look like this.

1105
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:17,001
Charlotte Bless, you is a mess.

1106
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:19,271
And you'd do anything to get your man

1107
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:22,674
out of jail-- wouldn't you?

1108
01:03:27,146 --> 01:03:28,614
Thirsty, huh?

1109
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:29,848
Oh, yeah.

1110
01:03:29,915 --> 01:03:32,918
# That man is dangerous #

1111
01:03:32,985 --> 01:03:35,354
You keep staring like that,

1112
01:03:35,421 --> 01:03:38,090
we're gonna have a problem.

1113
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:40,960
What really happened down there, Charlotte?

1114
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,363
After you went to the hairdresser, what happened? Hm?

1115
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,832
Jack, would you tell your brother to get his hands off of me?

1116
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,868
Come on, man. Let's go somewhere else. Easy, little brother.

1117
01:03:48,935 --> 01:03:51,104
Just fucking relax, boy.

1118
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:53,274
Miss Bless ain't got no answer, huh?

1119
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:57,277
I didn't think so.

1120
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:03,150
Your brother's acting strange.

1121
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:05,553
Not used to drinking like this.

1122
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,155
# Is this love affair for real Or is it just one and done? #

1123
01:04:08,222 --> 01:04:10,224
# I'm telling you #

1124
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:11,826
A little more than that.

1125
01:04:19,701 --> 01:04:21,035
Why is Ward doing this?

1126
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:25,140
We got 50 places to be tomorrow.

1127
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,250
What is that?

1128
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:37,987
It's beautiful.

1129
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:43,259
Don't turn it down.

1130
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:46,062
No one's ever given me something like this before.

1131
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:55,405
Well, you just tell me when you want it back, huh?

1132
01:04:57,006 --> 01:04:58,909
It's beautiful.

1133
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:19,564
You want me to fuck you, Jack?

1134
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:23,401
Then I'm gonna fuck you any way you want.

1135
01:05:26,805 --> 01:05:28,740
Jack.

1136
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:32,645
Jack!

1137
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:36,915
I want to get some alligator shoes.

1138
01:05:36,982 --> 01:05:39,085
Mmm, Jack.

1139
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:41,886
You wanted your ass whupped.

1140
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:43,422
Is that what you wanted?

1141
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:45,057
Tell me what you want.

1142
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:46,692
You're a dirty pig.

1143
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:48,928
I'll fuck you any way you want.

1144
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:51,397
Little white pig.

1145
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:57,504
Jack? Jack! Jack!

1146
01:05:57,571 --> 01:05:58,605
Jack, wake up!

1147
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,974
Something's going on in Ward's room.

1148
01:06:28,103 --> 01:06:29,837
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:31,639
Stop it!

1150
01:06:31,706 --> 01:06:32,908
What the fuck?

1151
01:06:36,678 --> 01:06:38,881
Help! We need help!

1152
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:17,254
Where's the fucking keys?

1153
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:19,523
Where's the fucking keys, you piece of shit?

1154
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,525
Motherfucker, wake up!

1155
01:07:24,428 --> 01:07:25,263
Help!

1156
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,934
Where are the fucking keys?

1157
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:31,736
Ward, what's the plastic for?

1158
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:35,607
What is the plastic?

1159
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:43,515
What the fuck?

1160
01:08:02,936 --> 01:08:05,238
I've watched you so often.

1161
01:08:05,305 --> 01:08:08,309
You sit here, and I heard that you play a little drum.

1162
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,210
You didn't get up and do anything. No.

1163
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:12,947
I heard you could sing,

1164
01:08:13,013 --> 01:08:14,581
but with me you are going to sing.

1165
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:20,821
He's gonna be fine.

1166
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:02,499
You don't have to sleep all the way down there.

1167
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:33,131
All right.

1168
01:09:33,197 --> 01:09:34,899
Just this once.

1169
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,543
I can't fuck with this TV on.

1170
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:51,149
Feels kind of awkward to be talking

1171
01:09:51,215 --> 01:09:52,685
while you see this.

1172
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:02,696
But it's kind of awkward that they're doing it in the first place.

1173
01:10:08,602 --> 01:10:10,836
Most boys Jack's age fall in love

1174
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:13,173
with their high school or college sweetheart,

1175
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:15,875
but Jack never bothered much with girls

1176
01:10:15,942 --> 01:10:17,177
after his mama left.

1177
01:10:22,116 --> 01:10:24,951
I guess you could say he had abandonment issues.

1178
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:28,122
With Charlotte, it was like he was getting his mama,

1179
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:31,726
his high school sweetheart, and a oversexed Barbie doll

1180
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:33,628
all rolled into one.

1181
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,237
Anywho, I think y'all seen enough.

1182
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:48,310
My hair looks like crap. Don't even look at it.

1183
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,078
Oh, shit.

1184
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,581
I got to go to the hairdresser.

1185
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,484
My wig ain't acting right.

1186
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:56,953
I don't understand what the fuck

1187
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,654
you're doing with Hillary.

1188
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,159
Oh.

1189
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:06,763
Here we go.

1190
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,398
You don't love him.

1191
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,601
Really? Mm-hm.

1192
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,002
You don't know that.

1193
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:17,374
You don't know anything.

1194
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:19,609
You're 20 years old. You're not that much older.

1195
01:11:20,945 --> 01:11:22,613
I'm a lot older.

1196
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:26,183
It ain't gonna happen.

1197
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,418
Look at me.

1198
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:29,019
It's not practical.

1199
01:11:29,086 --> 01:11:31,422
I'm not as practical as the murderer?

1200
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,624
He's not guilty, Jack. That's the point.

1201
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:35,927
That's not the point. Fuck this. I knew it would happen.

1202
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:37,429
What?

1203
01:11:37,495 --> 01:11:39,129
I give you some ass and suddenly--

1204
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:45,135
Look--Hillary ain't so bad.

1205
01:11:45,202 --> 01:11:47,472
And I'm not so good.

1206
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:50,041
I've got another side.

1207
01:11:50,108 --> 01:11:51,843
I got a fucked-up side,

1208
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,878
and it gets along just fine with my man.

1209
01:11:53,945 --> 01:11:55,815
You can't split yourself into sides.

1210
01:11:55,881 --> 01:11:57,750
Sure, you can. Just ask your brother.

1211
01:11:57,817 --> 01:11:59,985
What the fuck does Ward have to do with this?

1212
01:12:00,051 --> 01:12:02,054
He has a dark side and I don't mean him being a fag.

1213
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:05,992
Now these boys lived for each other.

1214
01:12:06,058 --> 01:12:10,296
Jack wasn't hurt by Ward being a homosexual

1215
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:13,232
or the dark stuff that he was into.

1216
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:16,670
He was just hurt that Ward never told him.

1217
01:12:21,808 --> 01:12:23,910
Hi. Hey, there.

1218
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:28,382
H e's doing better. He's gonna be all right. Good.

1219
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,085
So, I gotta go.

1220
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:34,421
Go where? Where you going?

1221
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:37,158
I'm going back home.

1222
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,362
You don't have to go anywhere.

1223
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:44,198
It's just the way it works.

1224
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:46,167
You shouldn't go anywhere you don't want to go.

1225
01:12:51,607 --> 01:12:53,274
Who says I don't want to go?

1226
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,111
Why do you have to go?

1227
01:12:58,113 --> 01:12:59,347
'Cause I do.

1228
01:13:00,783 --> 01:13:02,418
Take this ring back.

1229
01:13:04,186 --> 01:13:05,721
Yardley called the hotel.

1230
01:13:05,788 --> 01:13:07,656
Did you tell him?

1231
01:13:07,723 --> 01:13:09,959
I told him Ward got mugged and beaten on the beach.

1232
01:13:13,629 --> 01:13:14,964
Well, what'd he say?

1233
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:17,400
Not much.

1234
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:19,468
Wanted to know if he was gonna make it.

1235
01:13:19,535 --> 01:13:21,871
When I told him it wasn't serious,

1236
01:13:21,938 --> 01:13:25,209
he kind of just lost interest. He's not gonna be much help for a while.

1237
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,311
Didn't sound like he needed much help.

1238
01:13:28,378 --> 01:13:30,815
He can't go write the story alone, Charlotte.

1239
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:33,917
Well, we'll just have to see. He doesn't know enough about it.

1240
01:13:33,984 --> 01:13:35,786
This isn't about a newspaper article, Jack.

1241
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,388
It's about a person's life.

1242
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,089
That's the whole point we're here, okay?

1243
01:13:39,155 --> 01:13:40,925
So it's about someone's life.

1244
01:13:43,728 --> 01:13:46,564
Baby, don't go.

1245
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,766
You're starting to screw with my head.

1246
01:13:50,669 --> 01:13:52,570
Look, you're a good kid, all right?

1247
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:55,774
You're--

1248
01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:59,110
You got your whole life ahead of you,

1249
01:13:59,176 --> 01:14:00,646
and you want me?

1250
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,253
Jack went down to "The Miami Times"

1251
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,690
to try to stop Yardley from publishing the article.

1252
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:15,295
He didn't want his brother's name on it.

1253
01:14:16,195 --> 01:14:17,864
Jack.

1254
01:14:19,464 --> 01:14:21,200
Hi.

1255
01:14:21,267 --> 01:14:25,205
Hey. How's Ward? How's your brother doing?

1256
01:14:25,272 --> 01:14:27,307
Been trying to get ahold of you since yesterday.

1257
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:29,977
Good. He's obviously not doing so badly then.

1258
01:14:30,044 --> 01:14:34,982
Sorry, I didn't want any distractions. Come, sit, sit.

1259
01:14:35,049 --> 01:14:37,384
He wants to read what you're writing.

1260
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:39,987
A s soon as I'm done, he'll be the first to read it, as always.

1261
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,157
Damn it! I'm so sick of your shit, man!

1262
01:14:43,223 --> 01:14:45,093
His name is on that, too.

1263
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,162
He wants to read it before it's published.

1264
01:14:48,228 --> 01:14:49,998
Okay? That's it. Uh-huh.

1265
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:52,667
He just wants to read it before it's published.

1266
01:14:52,733 --> 01:14:54,836
You got to get those facts straight.

1267
01:14:54,903 --> 01:14:57,172
You got to get all the facts straight.

1268
01:14:57,238 --> 01:14:59,841
You're starting to sound like your brother.

1269
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:02,477
Look, we have a deadline here.

1270
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:04,479
I've told you, this is the newspaper business.

1271
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,247
We don't have time to get all the facts.

1272
01:15:06,314 --> 01:15:09,084
We both know the town of Lately set Hillary up.

1273
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,254
We've got the story. It's not the fucking truth!

1274
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:15,057
You want to talk about the motherfucking truth?

1275
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:21,597
You thought I was from London?

1276
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:23,699
Ain't no Negro getting a job up in this spot

1277
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:27,069
unless he's a colored motherfucking James Bond, you dig?

1278
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:32,042
I got drunk once and let Ward suck my dick.

1279
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:36,179
He got a taste for niggers and now he hates himself.

1280
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:37,614
That's the truth.

1281
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:42,219
Go back to your brother, boy.

1282
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,392
I have got a deadline to meet.

1283
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:26,434
Hello?

1284
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,071
Put Ward on the phone.

1285
01:16:30,137 --> 01:16:32,940
Why'd you put his byline on that article?

1286
01:16:33,007 --> 01:16:34,675
How could you sign his name on that?

1287
01:16:34,742 --> 01:16:36,744
Tell him we got Hillary out.

1288
01:16:36,811 --> 01:16:38,613
The governor's gonna pardon him.

1289
01:16:41,749 --> 01:16:43,618
Hillary's getting out.

1290
01:16:47,154 --> 01:16:49,257
"I've had some time to think over the past few months

1291
01:16:49,324 --> 01:16:52,861
about me, about you.

1292
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:55,530
I'm not sure I found what I want out of life yet.

1293
01:16:55,597 --> 01:16:59,202
All I know is that I don't want to live it without you.

1294
01:16:59,268 --> 01:17:02,104
Please take this ring back. Love, Jack. "

1295
01:17:10,179 --> 01:17:11,714
Get the door.

1296
01:17:15,618 --> 01:17:18,454
Get the fucking door, bitch!

1297
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,673
Who the fuck are you?

1298
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:37,641
I'm Hillary. What you want?

1299
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,344
Get the fuck out! I'm with Charlotte.

1300
01:17:39,411 --> 01:17:41,078
That bitch took my-- I'll call you later!

1301
01:17:44,382 --> 01:17:47,018
Charlotte, you want me to call the police?

1302
01:17:56,494 --> 01:17:58,430
There she is.

1303
01:17:59,732 --> 01:18:01,099
I'm sorry.

1304
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,767
I was gonna write you a letter--

1305
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:05,204
No, I don't need your letters. Come here.

1306
01:18:10,343 --> 01:18:11,544
Uh--

1307
01:18:18,685 --> 01:18:20,087
Don't touch me.

1308
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:21,854
Come on here. Don't touch you?

1309
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:25,559
Don't touch you?

1310
01:18:28,194 --> 01:18:30,097
It's okay.

1311
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:32,232
It's all right, baby.

1312
01:18:46,781 --> 01:18:47,815
Anything.

1313
01:18:56,824 --> 01:18:57,625
That's all right.

1314
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:17,579
You told me you loved me in your third letter.

1315
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:19,683
Do you love me?

1316
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:22,117
Yes!

1317
01:19:46,043 --> 01:19:49,046
You always fuck like this?

1318
01:19:49,113 --> 01:19:50,781
Like it was the last time?

1319
01:19:57,788 --> 01:19:59,725
Do you think I'm pretty?

1320
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,259
You fuck those niggers like this?

1321
01:20:09,134 --> 01:20:11,870
Gonna get all inside here!

1322
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:17,342
Now pack your shit and let's go.

1323
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:26,986
I don't think I'm gonna like living in a swamp.

1324
01:20:27,053 --> 01:20:31,090
I don't want to live in a swamp. I like it here.

1325
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:38,032
And that was their declaration of love.

1326
01:20:38,098 --> 01:20:40,834
So Hillary took Charlotte to the swamp.

1327
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,550
So did you hear about old man Henry? No.

1328
01:20:56,617 --> 01:20:59,287
He got drunk in his back yard by the water,

1329
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,324
and the alligators came out and took a big chunk of his leg.

1330
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,694
Ha. Just joking.

1331
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,064
My daddy rooster, he got jumped

1332
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,865
by three of his sons,

1333
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:13,903
so I need to find a home for three of them.

1334
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:16,071
So he's in my house sitting,

1335
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:18,207
so I need--I know you only have hens.

1336
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:20,710
That's why I was wondering, you know, if you want to babysit,

1337
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:22,979
you know, adopt three of them for you.

1338
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:26,716
But they'd be good though, because you have hens. No.

1339
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:30,186
You're my only hope. No! I don't want any.

1340
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:31,554
Come on, Charlotte.

1341
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:33,423
I need you to do me a favor.

1342
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:35,092
I need you to post this thing for me.

1343
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:37,226
It ain't got a stamp on it.

1344
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,895
What's wrong with you today? It's real important.

1345
01:21:38,962 --> 01:21:40,497
You think you can do that for me?

1346
01:21:40,564 --> 01:21:42,332
You're not acting yourself today.

1347
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:50,073
Why's your door open, huh?

1348
01:21:52,744 --> 01:21:54,212
Smells like piss in here.

1349
01:21:54,312 --> 01:21:56,947
Ward Ward said you might show up.

1350
01:21:57,014 --> 01:21:58,349
Left him a note.

1351
01:21:59,684 --> 01:22:01,452
You stink.

1352
01:22:01,519 --> 01:22:03,187
I can smell you from over here.

1353
01:22:03,254 --> 01:22:06,457
Come here, boy. Come sit down.

1354
01:22:06,524 --> 01:22:08,594
What you doing back in Miami?

1355
01:22:12,698 --> 01:22:14,166
Yardley's gone.

1356
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,367
He quit?

1357
01:22:16,434 --> 01:22:17,870
No.

1358
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,308
He's in New York.

1359
01:22:24,043 --> 01:22:26,145
Signing some book deal.

1360
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:30,382
Hero of the new journalism or some kind of shit. I don't know.

1361
01:22:30,449 --> 01:22:33,286
W.W. moved Ellen into the house, huh?

1362
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:36,555
Whatever.

1363
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:40,126
Whatever makes him happy.

1364
01:23:07,856 --> 01:23:09,925
There wasn't no developer, Jack.

1365
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,533
All right, let's move.

1366
01:23:20,002 --> 01:23:21,103
Come on, go shower, Ward.

1367
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:23,172
I'm tired.

1368
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:26,441
Come on.

1369
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,345
Jeez.

1370
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,396
I keep thinking I missed something, Jack.

1371
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:52,770
Like I missed something I was supposed to see

1372
01:23:52,836 --> 01:23:54,471
that was right in front of me.

1373
01:23:54,538 --> 01:23:56,006
Like what?

1374
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,811
The point of it.

1375
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,415
Doesn't matter.

1376
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,819
Things got out of hand.

1377
01:24:07,886 --> 01:24:09,854
You got hurt,

1378
01:24:09,954 --> 01:24:12,424
Yardley got his fucking book deal.

1379
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:16,762
Hillary got Charlotte in the swamp.

1380
01:24:18,897 --> 01:24:23,569
The idea--is that-- you run the water

1381
01:24:23,636 --> 01:24:24,836
while you're in there with it.

1382
01:24:26,338 --> 01:24:27,506
Come on, man.

1383
01:24:34,847 --> 01:24:36,182
Hey.

1384
01:24:43,857 --> 01:24:46,525
What if we didn't get it right, huh?

1385
01:24:47,761 --> 01:24:49,229
Makes no difference.

1386
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:50,930
It makes no difference, Jack?

1387
01:24:50,997 --> 01:24:52,466
You don't know what it feels like

1388
01:24:52,566 --> 01:24:54,801
to get it exactly right now.

1389
01:24:54,868 --> 01:24:58,739
To get it down just the way it happened.

1390
01:24:58,805 --> 01:25:00,440
You're going back to see Hillary.

1391
01:25:00,507 --> 01:25:02,010
Fuck yeah, I am.

1392
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,711
Do you ever hear from her?

1393
01:25:04,778 --> 01:25:06,113
No.

1394
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:08,116
Miss Bless? No.

1395
01:25:08,182 --> 01:25:10,551
I wonder what she thinks of him now, huh?

1396
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,822
Can't see her sitting on the porch stoop

1397
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:16,959
holding a silver spoon

1398
01:25:17,026 --> 01:25:19,494
and waiting for the ice cream carton to come her way, can you?

1399
01:25:22,197 --> 01:25:23,966
I dug around.

1400
01:25:24,033 --> 01:25:26,468
There wasn't no proof, no how, nowhere

1401
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:29,838
that they was ever stealing sod that night.

1402
01:25:29,905 --> 01:25:33,842
They want me to keep my mouth shut.

1403
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:37,681
Don't want me to tell my story. Well, fuck them.

1404
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:40,516
I'm gonna tell my story. I'm gonna write my story,

1405
01:25:40,582 --> 01:25:43,687
and they can publish it wherever the fuck they want to.

1406
01:25:51,428 --> 01:25:54,431
Yeah, Mama always said you better be--

1407
01:25:54,497 --> 01:26:00,670
right and be last before you gonna be first and be wrong, boy.

1408
01:26:00,737 --> 01:26:04,008
Be right and be last before you go gonna be first and be wrong--

1409
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,308
Yeah, I know!

1410
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,137
I heard-- They said things about--

1411
01:26:32,204 --> 01:26:34,239
Oh, yeah. It's all true.

1412
01:26:34,306 --> 01:26:37,377
Just kidding. You should see the other guy.

1413
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:40,646
Smile. Smile.

1414
01:26:40,712 --> 01:26:41,814
Thank you.

1415
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,423
Everyone, please. We're cutting the cake!

1416
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,958
Where's the photographer?

1417
01:26:54,227 --> 01:26:55,695
Hey, Claire, can you hand me

1418
01:26:55,762 --> 01:26:58,598
that salt over there?

1419
01:26:58,665 --> 01:26:59,632
Thank you.

1420
01:27:01,468 --> 01:27:02,836
Hi.

1421
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:06,840
You ain't supposed to be in here.

1422
01:27:06,907 --> 01:27:08,642
You gonna get me in-- I got you a drink.

1423
01:27:12,746 --> 01:27:16,184
You know W. W. fired me.

1424
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:17,952
I'm gonna talk to your boss

1425
01:27:18,019 --> 01:27:19,753
and tell him you're a friend of the family.

1426
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,656
No, Jack. Yeah.

1427
01:27:21,723 --> 01:27:23,625
All I ever did was cook and clean for you boys.

1428
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:25,759
I wasn't never no family.

1429
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:28,964
Anyway, go on back outside.

1430
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:32,434
Well, Ward's out there. You gonna come see him?

1431
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,803
Are you trying to get me fired?

1432
01:27:34,869 --> 01:27:36,172
I miss you.

1433
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:43,612
I got something for you. Wait a minute.

1434
01:27:52,955 --> 01:27:54,824
This came for you about a month ago.

1435
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:56,660
She told him to tell-

1436
01:27:56,727 --> 01:28:00,496
She told him not to let you see it.

1437
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:03,033
"Dear Jack, I can't believe

1438
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:05,769
I'm finally writing you this letter

1439
01:28:05,836 --> 01:28:07,404
or if it will get to you

1440
01:28:07,471 --> 01:28:10,273
or whether you'll even read it.

1441
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,577
Jack, I think I've really messed up this time.

1442
01:28:13,644 --> 01:28:15,112
Don't misunderstand me.

1443
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:17,415
Hillary lo ves me, in his way.

1444
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:19,750
It's just me that isn't made for this place,

1445
01:28:19,816 --> 01:28:22,320
for this lifestyle.

1446
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:25,256
I hope I can make it to your father's wedding

1447
01:28:25,323 --> 01:28:30,696
so I can hear you tell me, 'I told you so.'

1448
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:35,501
Take care for now. Sweetly, your Charlotte. "

1449
01:28:39,038 --> 01:28:40,873
Is that from blondie?

1450
01:28:49,048 --> 01:28:50,082
Thank you.

1451
01:28:52,218 --> 01:28:53,686
Where's your hat?

1452
01:28:53,752 --> 01:28:55,455
Oh, I forgot. Get out of the kitchen.

1453
01:28:55,522 --> 01:28:57,290
I'm sorry.

1454
01:28:57,357 --> 01:28:59,426
Excuse me. I'm Jack Jansen. I'm the groom's son.

1455
01:28:59,492 --> 01:29:01,961
My father wants to know what exactly is taking dinner so long.

1456
01:29:02,062 --> 01:29:03,863
It'll be ready in a minute, sir. Thank you.

1457
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,733
Put the hair under the hat.

1458
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,202
I don't want your black hair in my food.

1459
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:14,741
You can put your black hair in my food.

1460
01:29:20,247 --> 01:29:21,482
Cheers.

1461
01:29:27,054 --> 01:29:28,422
Bye, Anita.

1462
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:40,335
Bye, Jack.

1463
01:29:58,454 --> 01:30:00,423
You wouldn't leave without me, would you?

1464
01:30:00,523 --> 01:30:03,593
Drop you off at the motel. I'm going somewhere.

1465
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:06,130
Mind me asking where you're going afterwards?

1466
01:30:06,196 --> 01:30:07,463
Going to Charlotte's.

1467
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:09,098
Well, it gotta be tonight?

1468
01:30:09,165 --> 01:30:10,634
I got to get her the fuck out of there.

1469
01:30:10,701 --> 01:30:12,269
I got to get her out of there!

1470
01:30:12,336 --> 01:30:13,970
Charlotte's acting on her own free will.

1471
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:15,506
What do you want me to say? Move.

1472
01:30:15,606 --> 01:30:17,141
I got to go to the Van Wetters' anyway.

1473
01:30:17,207 --> 01:30:18,842
Come with me tomorrow morning.

1474
01:30:18,909 --> 01:30:20,944
We're going now. It ain't the right time.

1475
01:30:21,011 --> 01:30:23,347
Get the fuck out my way. You ain't driving drunk like this.

1476
01:30:23,414 --> 01:30:25,183
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, huh?

1477
01:30:26,685 --> 01:30:27,851
What?

1478
01:30:36,227 --> 01:30:38,396
Charlotte must be a good piece of ass.

1479
01:30:38,463 --> 01:30:41,232
You look like a pirate. I know.

1480
01:30:41,299 --> 01:30:43,668
Do this for me one time. Go "Aargh. "

1481
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:44,369
Uh-huh.

1482
01:30:47,138 --> 01:30:49,909
Hey, you're driving all squirrelly, man.

1483
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:52,211
Hey, Jack, sit on down. Hey.

1484
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:01,020
You sure it's this way?

1485
01:31:01,087 --> 01:31:02,388
I'm sure it's this way.

1486
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,760
Ain't a good time to be drinking too much out here, Jack.

1487
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:11,031
Yeah, you're one to talk.

1488
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:13,367
Keeping your promise to Dad, did you?

1489
01:31:13,433 --> 01:31:15,102
Not to drink on his big day?

1490
01:31:15,168 --> 01:31:17,938
How you holding up?

1491
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,608
Let's see your hands. Are they shaking?

1492
01:31:20,674 --> 01:31:25,546
They shaking, Ward, huh? Don't drink.

1493
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,949
Well, why do you take after the worst of me, Jack?

1494
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:32,954
'Cause you're my brother.

1495
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:43,264
Wedding party, Charlotte?

1496
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,733
I'm going to the wedding.

1497
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,468
Don't be difficult. I told you--

1498
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:48,202
I don't want you to go.

1499
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:50,306
No. I told you. I'm going to the wedding.

1500
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:52,441
Watch out.

1501
01:31:54,376 --> 01:31:55,811
God, it smells like shit.

1502
01:31:59,649 --> 01:32:02,785
Electric fence. You all right?

1503
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,321
You all right?

1504
01:32:04,387 --> 01:32:06,656
Goddamn.

1505
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,069
You let me lead.

1506
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:36,721
I don't want to quarrel with you.

1507
01:32:36,787 --> 01:32:38,456
You're my little pony.

1508
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:43,794
I just want to climb up on you one more time.

1509
01:32:56,375 --> 01:32:58,143
I can't believe she'd live here.

1510
01:33:09,055 --> 01:33:10,390
Charlotte!

1511
01:33:39,921 --> 01:33:41,389
Charlotte?

1512
01:33:49,364 --> 01:33:50,598
Charlotte!

1513
01:33:58,106 --> 01:33:59,542
What you want?

1514
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:08,985
She not here.

1515
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:11,053
She gone.

1516
01:34:11,153 --> 01:34:13,456
What is it you want with my wife?

1517
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,129
Huh?

1518
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:23,099
What is it you want with my wife?

1519
01:34:25,936 --> 01:34:27,971
Just wanted to say hello.

1520
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:31,742
A quick hello and a quick poke while you're at it?

1521
01:34:31,808 --> 01:34:33,778
How about you? What you up to, Ward?

1522
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,215
I know what you came for.

1523
01:34:41,285 --> 01:34:43,487
I got what you want.

1524
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:45,490
Where is she?

1525
01:34:45,556 --> 01:34:47,892
How should I know? I'm not leaving until I see her.

1526
01:34:47,959 --> 01:34:49,427
She not here. She gone.

1527
01:34:50,595 --> 01:34:51,763
Let's go. Where?

1528
01:34:51,829 --> 01:34:52,997
How should I know?

1529
01:34:53,064 --> 01:34:54,566
Last night she told me

1530
01:34:54,667 --> 01:34:56,267
she was going to your father's wedding!

1531
01:34:56,334 --> 01:34:58,169
You're a liar! We just come from there!

1532
01:34:58,236 --> 01:35:00,339
And that's where you should go back to, boy!

1533
01:35:00,406 --> 01:35:01,840
He's lying!

1534
01:35:01,907 --> 01:35:03,341
He's lying.

1535
01:35:03,409 --> 01:35:05,411
I got this. Go back to the boat.

1536
01:35:05,511 --> 01:35:07,846
Where is she? Where is she?

1537
01:35:07,913 --> 01:35:09,381
Stop provoking me, boy,

1538
01:35:09,481 --> 01:35:10,983
and do what your brother tells you!

1539
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:12,584
I said I'm not leaving until I see her!

1540
01:35:15,255 --> 01:35:17,623
Goddamn it, he killed her.

1541
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:19,459
He killed her, Ward.

1542
01:35:19,526 --> 01:35:21,628
You killed her!

1543
01:35:21,695 --> 01:35:24,130
You son of a bitch!

1544
01:35:24,197 --> 01:35:26,032
That's all you were good for is killing her!

1545
01:35:26,099 --> 01:35:27,567
Huh?

1546
01:35:27,667 --> 01:35:28,703
Run, Jack!

1547
01:35:31,438 --> 01:35:33,708
Come on, boy. Show me.

1548
01:35:33,774 --> 01:35:35,242
I'm gonna fuck you up.

1549
01:35:35,343 --> 01:35:36,810
Come on!

1550
01:35:36,876 --> 01:35:38,212
Jack!

1551
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:39,714
Ward!

1552
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,549
Ward!

1553
01:35:41,615 --> 01:35:42,849
Is this what you wanted?

1554
01:35:46,487 --> 01:35:47,722
Yeah.

1555
01:35:53,628 --> 01:35:55,297
You got what you come for.

1556
01:35:56,797 --> 01:35:59,001
Paperboy.

1557
01:35:59,067 --> 01:36:00,869
Where you going, paperboy?

1558
01:36:02,704 --> 01:36:04,673
Ain't no way out of this one.

1559
01:36:10,412 --> 01:36:11,747
Fuck you!

1560
01:40:35,524 --> 01:40:37,794
Hillary Van Wetter was tried and convicted

1561
01:40:37,861 --> 01:40:41,263
in the murders of Charlotte Bless and Ward Jansen.

1562
01:40:52,309 --> 01:40:57,281
He died in the electric chair at the Florida State Prison.

1563
01:40:57,382 --> 01:41:00,350
Nobody ever found out who murdered Sheriff Call.

1564
01:41:15,667 --> 01:41:21,406
My little Jack finally saw his mama again at Ward's funeral.

1565
01:41:21,473 --> 01:41:23,742
He became a writer of some renown.

1566
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:31,751
He never did get over his first true love.
