1
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:33,416
Since the dawn of man, the vampires
have walked among us, killing, feeding.

2
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:38,453
The only one with the strength or skill
to stop their heinous evil is the Slayer,

3
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:42,014
she who bears the birthmark,
the mark of the coven.

4
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:47,542
Trained by the Watcher,
one slayer dies and the next is chosen.

5
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,740
And I shall be his sword.

6
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:52,815
Let Satan tremble.

7
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:55,657
The Slayer is born.

8
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,857
OK, people. They're psyching you out.
Let's not be so defensive out there.

9
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:45,177
What do we say on the court? Repeat after
me. "I am a person. I have a right to the ball."

10
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:49,257
Good. Now, here's our key play.
We're gonna... Are we the Xs or the Os?

11
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,938
- We're the Os.
- Right. OK.

12
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:42,415
Mr Howard is so heinous.

13
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,860
He's always giving me a hard time.

14
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:49,778
I get a C plus on the test, and he tells me
"You have no sense of history."

15
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:53,095
I have no sense of history?
He wears a brown tie.

16
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:57,097
You got a C plus?
I can't believe I cheated off of you.

17
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,857
Excuse me for
not knowing about El Salvador.

18
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:02,174
Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.

19
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,135
Look at that jacket.

20
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:11,015
This is so lush.

21
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:16,255
- Wouldn'tyou guys just love me in this?
- Guys, what's the sitch? I'm bored.

22
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:20,496
- What do you think?
- Please. It's so five minutes ago.

23
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:21,573
Yeah.

24
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:25,932
What are we doing?

25
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,174
- Why don't we go see a movie?
- Where?

26
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:30,459
- Omniplex?
- Nee sitch. No way.

27
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,694
- No THX.
- They don't even have Dolby.

28
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,098
- Sorry.
- Beverly Center.

29
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,937
- They show previews for foreign movies.
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:39,094
- AMC?
- Bogus corn.

31
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:42,620
Totally stale. And the ushers are,
like, the acne patrol. Totally.

32
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:47,573
OK. OK. How about...
We're thinking Pavilion? Sitch solved?

33
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:50,940
- Sounds toasty.
- Excellent. What's playing there?

34
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,254
I don't know. Does it matter?

35
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,423
- Excuse much. Rude or anything?
- Nice ensemble.

36
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:00,417
What a homeless.

37
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,218
Is Jeffrey really
spending the night atyour house?

38
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:15,182
- That's the plan.
- What a sitch.

39
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:18,574
Your parents are always away. You're lucky.

40
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,814
- I guess.
- Mine don't. I'll die a virgin.

41
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,657
You guys shut up, please.

42
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:26,178
It could happen.

43
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:28,255
God, what a 'tude.

44
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:32,415
It's the Loch Ness monster.

45
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:35,778
God, take a chill lozenge.

46
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:37,934
- Like we don't have rights too.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:40,015
Ignore them, OK? lgnore them.

48
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:44,896
Oh, no, no. I can't believe these people.
We paid good money to see this.

49
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:48,021
- No, we didn't.
- Oh, yeah.

50
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:58,773
Look at the street. They're all
lining up for me because I am the champ!

51
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:02,258
Look at the moon, man. It's a huge moon.

52
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,904
Guys, tonight we gotta go out and party.

53
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:08,738
If you spent more time sleeping,
you'd spend less time on the court sucking.

54
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:11,577
You were a bonehead out there yesterday.

55
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:16,180
Anyway, I'm booked. Gotta spend
some quality time with the little lady.

56
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:20,218
- Pushover. You're such a pushover.
- You guys are pathetic.

57
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:23,740
- I'm blowing. Andy, you coming?
- I'll catch a ride with Jeffrey.

58
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,384
- Later.
- Slam dunk.

59
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:28,455
Later.

60
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:46,379
Jeffrey, I don't wanna sound sexist
or anything, but can I borrow her?

61
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,375
- Andy.
- No way.

62
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:51,456
You'd get her dirty.
He would, honey. He's an animal.

63
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,854
- See you at my house.
- Don't look.

64
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,700
Oh, man.

65
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,173
I'm not in the mood for this.

66
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:22,859
OK, whoever's behind me
better be gone when I turn around.

67
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:28,217
What are you? Are you some kind
of weirdo or somethin'? Huh?

68
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:36,223
The cause of death was
a neck wound that resembled,

69
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:39,819
in the words of one bystander,
"a really gross hickey".

70
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:46,055
In a related story, the body of the third slasher
victim has disappearedfrom the morgue.

71
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:49,136
- There it is.
- Have fun. Be good. Stay away from the Jag.

72
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:51,499
I know.

73
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:54,223
- That's everything.
- Bye.

74
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:56,374
Kiss noise. Bye-bye, Bobby.

75
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:59,900
- Bye.
- ...victim was found today, the fourth.

76
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:03,818
And Lulu just can't get pregnant.

77
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:08,341
- She thinks my name is Bobby?
- It's possible she thinks my name's Bobby.

78
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:10,654
Real quality-timer, huh?

79
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:14,375
Something like that.

80
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,734
Hey, it works for me.

81
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:22,261
I mean, if they wanna leave you alone
in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...

82
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:26,895
The weather hasn't disappointed us. Constant
sun and temperatures in the high 70s

83
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,976
have made every winter's day a beach day.

84
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:06,378
Oh, please. Show me a real slayer.

85
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:09,854
- Lothos.
- Will you people ever learn?

86
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,935
We can't be stopped.

87
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,213
This is our world now.

88
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:46,174
Sleep, my master, my own. Sleep.

89
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:49,901
I have already begun
building you a newfamily.

90
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:55,616
Soon we will be legion. When you rise,
we will claim this place as our own.

91
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,457
Rubies will drip from your lips.

92
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:08,778
Soon.

93
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:14,464
The environment. I tell you, it's totally key.
The earth is in terrible shape. We could die.

94
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:16,978
- Sting's doing it.
- I thought he was doing Indians.

95
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,817
- How about the homelesses?
- Move.

96
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:22,862
Aren't there any sicknesses
that aren't too depressing?

97
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:25,299
- Hi.
- Whatyou guys doin'?

98
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:30,095
- Senior dance. We need a theme.
- It has to be a socially conscious theme.

99
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:33,415
One that reflects the students'
growing awareness of

100
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:36,018
and involvement in the world around them.

101
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:38,095
Downer.

102
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,778
I still say the environment.
That's my suggestion.

103
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:43,253
- Yeah, me too.
- Yes. It's gonna work.

104
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:47,417
What are the most immediate threats
to the world environment right now?

105
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:49,860
Litter?

106
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:52,504
- Litter, yeah.
- Forest fires?

107
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:55,452
- Bugs?
- Bugs, totally.

108
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,535
- Yeah. I hate bugs.
- Yeah.

109
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,979
- Cassandra, write it down.
- OK, guys.

110
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,817
What do you think about the ozone layer?

111
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:04,895
Yeah.

112
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:10,104
- Yeah. We gotta get rid of that.
- First bell, people. Time marches on.

113
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:12,698
- What's your point?
- Button it, Kramer.

114
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:15,776
Let's meet tonight, OK? Caf?Blas?

115
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:18,822
- Cool. We can figure decorations and stuff.
- Yeah.

116
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:23,659
I don't know, guys. I really wanna
get a head start on my homework.

117
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:26,542
Oh, yeah. I love that one.

118
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:34,417
Buff, I don't see why
we have to invite every single senior.

119
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:38,538
Because it's the senior dance.
It's just a shot in the dark.

120
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:43,341
So? I mean, like, why do we have
to invite Nadia? She's such a blemish.

121
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,654
I know, you're right. She is.

122
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:47,735
Hi.

123
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:53,055
- What?
- I thought that look was over.

124
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:56,457
- Well, it's retro.
- Yeah, retro.

125
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:00,019
You can borrow it sometime.

126
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:04,541
OK. Maybe I will. We were talking about
the senior dance, if you're interested.

127
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,899
You guys, look who's coming.

128
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:10,455
Sick!

129
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:17,055
What does it look like?

130
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:22,733
Two coffees or a hot dog.

131
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:26,102
- Nothing on it and nothing on the side.
- Losers.

132
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:29,574
- I'm Charlotte. I'll be your waitress.
- Hi, Charlotte.

133
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:33,134
- Say something, Buffy.
- You guys are thrashed.

134
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:35,415
- Just a little.
- Are we?

135
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,541
That would explain the slurred speech.

136
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:42,899
Thanks. What's your name?

137
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:48,021
- Buffy.
- Yeah, it figures.

138
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:52,814
I'm Pike.

139
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:55,099
This is Benny.

140
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,653
And I'm Pike.

141
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:02,414
Pike isn't a name. It's a fish.

142
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:08,455
- Don't we know you guys?
- Hey, wait a minute.

143
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:10,978
You're the guys from the movie.

144
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:13,100
We hate you guys.

145
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,494
Like we care, I'm sure.

146
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,735
Yeah.

147
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,295
You guys were very rude, OK?
It was shocking.

148
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,296
- Well, you just snuck in anyway.
- Yeah.

149
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:29,062
Hey, Buffy. You hungry?
I got something for ya.

150
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:36,452
Oh, man. She wasted my dog.

151
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:45,733
I'll have it runnin' in a week.
All it needs is some brake pads.

152
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:50,454
Shocks and tyres. A new engine, maybe.
It'll be totally cherry.

153
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:53,900
When you get that car together,
let's bail. Get out of this town.

154
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:56,737
Those rich bitches are a plague.
They gotta be stopped.

155
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:58,860
You didn't like 'em? Give me that.

156
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:02,254
I mean, they're all the same.
They're just so stuck-up.

157
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:05,381
Pike, they're not even human. I hate 'em.

158
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:07,455
Yeah, but would you bone 'em?

159
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,978
Yes, definitely. Please, God.

160
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:13,579
Especially the blonde.
I'd give my right eye for a piece of that.

161
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,973
She's not even human.

162
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,022
Yes, but her yabos scoff at gravity.

163
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:24,258
Man, you're disgusting. You don't even like
her and you'd sleep with her. What is that?

164
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:27,575
I got news. Another shot of this
and I'll have sex with you.

165
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:30,462
Oh, yeah. Then you'll never call me.

166
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:42,861
- I think I'm gonna ralph.
- Hey, Benny, I'm here for you, man. I'm here.

167
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:46,215
I'm here for you, Ralph.

168
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:52,775
Oh, man.

169
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:12,981
This is not a very safe place
for you to fall asleep.

170
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:15,180
OK, Mom.

171
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:22,854
OK. Dribble, shoot, shoot.

172
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:26,576
Take that ball to the hoop, hoop.

173
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,700
- Right. Yeah.
- It's cool. I like that.

174
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:30,775
- Bye.
- Hey, you guys, I was thinking.

175
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:36,257
For the senior dance, what if we made
a big sign that says "Don't Tread On Me"?

176
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:38,539
You know? And a picture of the earth?

177
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:42,936
How do you not tread on the earth?
I mean, you kind of have to, right?

178
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,579
- Yeah, I never thought of that. Yeah.
- I gotta bail. You coming?

179
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:53,500
No, you guys blow. I'm waiting on Cassandra.
She's gonna help me with my history. Wait.

180
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:59,773
I kinda loaned her Kimberly's yellow
leather jacket, so don't tell her, all right?

181
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,259
- OK. I won't. See ya.
- Bye.

182
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:19,496
God! You scared me to death.

183
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:24,578
- Where the hell'd you come from?
- That was very impressive. The tumbling.

184
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:26,655
What?

185
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:31,417
I used to do gymnastics.
Are you looking for somebody?

186
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,543
I was looking for you, actually.

187
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:38,094
Why? Am I in trouble or something?
Cos if I am, I didn't do it.

188
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:43,172
You're not in trouble, I am.
I'm years late. You should have been taught.

189
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:46,734
But I wasn't certain
until just nowthat it was you.

190
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:51,454
- What are you talking about?
- I've searched everywhere for you, Buffy.

191
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:56,499
- Why?
- To bring you your birthright.

192
00:16:56,584 --> 00:17:00,657
My birthright?
Is that, like, a trust fund or something?

193
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:07,174
I think it'll be easier for you to understand
this birthright if I show it to you.

194
00:17:07,664 --> 00:17:12,533
All right? So you come
with me nowto the graveyard.

195
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,292
No, no, no, no.

196
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:20,057
My trust fund's in the graveyard?

197
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,135
God, what's your damage?

198
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,457
Buffy?

199
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:30,176
You're one of those skanky old men that
attacks little girls, right? Well, forgetyou.

200
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:34,093
My name is Merrick,
and you have been chosen, Buffy.

201
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:40,574
Chosen to go to the graveyard? Why don't
you just take the first runner-up, OK?

202
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:46,500
Everything depends on you, Buffy. You must
come to the graveyard while there's still time.

203
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:50,293
- Time to do what?
- Time to stop the killing.

204
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:55,936
- To stop the vampires.
- All right. Let me get this straight, OK?

205
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:59,300
You want me to go to the graveyard with you

206
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:03,059
because I'm the Chosen One
and there are vampires?

207
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,296
Yes.

208
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,579
Does Elvis talkto you?

209
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:11,543
Does he tell you to do things?
Do you see spots?

210
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,936
Spots? Yes, of course.

211
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:18,255
That's your proof. Spots.

212
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:22,583
You bear the mark.
You bear the mark of the coven.

213
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:24,655
What? That big old hairy mole?

214
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,735
Ew. I had that thing removed.

215
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:30,419
You knowing about my big old mole
doesn't prove anything,

216
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:34,133
except for it's way past
medication time for you, buddy.

217
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:37,853
- Why don'tyou just stay away from me?
- Ever dream you were someone else?

218
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:40,583
- Everybody does.
- Someone in the past.

219
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:45,183
Someone real.
A Magyar peasant girl, perhaps.

220
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:47,334
An Indian princess?

221
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:49,415
A slave?

222
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:55,741
- I was a slave.
- In Virginia.

223
00:18:56,104 --> 00:19:00,063
I don't know. There was, like,
this big farm or something.

224
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:06,701
There was this one where
there were these knights, and I am a...

225
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,858
A servant girl. A barmaid.

226
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:13,135
Oh, my God.

227
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:20,379
Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this.
There's one where there's this man.

228
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:23,183
I think he's a man.
He's in my dreams sometimes.

229
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:25,573
I'm fighting him.

230
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,657
Always fighting him. But he's so strong.

231
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:31,935
His name is Lothos.

232
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:38,299
How do you know all this?

233
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:41,535
Because it is your birthright
and I am a part of it.

234
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:48,422
You come with me to the graveyard,
and I will show you.

235
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:58,338
I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe
I'm in a graveyard with a strange man,

236
00:19:58,424 --> 00:20:01,973
hunting for vampires on a school night.

237
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:07,857
Why did you never
tell anyone aboutyour dreams?

238
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:11,175
Right. Tell everybody I'm crazy. Beauty idea.

239
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:16,699
- Cramps?
- None of your business. God.

240
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:20,663
This is it.
Robert Barmen was killed three days ago.

241
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:24,054
His body was found
in the bushes by the canal.

242
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,897
Extensive tissue damage.

243
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:29,976
Tearing at the neck and shoulders.

244
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:36,333
- Take these.
- Wait a minute.

245
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:41,737
No, no. You won't have to do anything.
They're just for your protection. Sit there.

246
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,133
I just need you to watch.

247
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,822
All right. What do we do now?

248
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:53,374
We wait for Robert Barmen to wake up.

249
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:58,415
Do you have any gum?

250
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:04,095
No.

251
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,383
Beefy!

252
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,015
Behind you.

253
00:22:43,424 --> 00:22:45,540
Pike.

254
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:47,615
Ben?

255
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:55,218
Where you been, man? I tried
to call your house, like, 50 times.

256
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:58,740
- I've been hanging.
- You left me hanging. I almost did a Hendrix.

257
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:01,213
- Let me in.
- This weird guy gave me a ride home.

258
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:03,340
I thought he was gonna hit on me.

259
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,619
Come on. Invite me in, Pike.

260
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:08,662
Wait a minute, man. What's wrong with you?

261
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:11,417
- I'm fine.
- You look like shit, man.

262
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:14,059
Well, I feel pretty.

263
00:23:17,224 --> 00:23:20,136
- You on smoothen?
- No.

264
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:27,214
Let me in, Pike. I'm hungry.

265
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:31,255
- Go home, Ben.
- I'm hungry.

266
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,142
You're floating.
Come on, man. Get away from here.

267
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:38,422
I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry!

268
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:51,258
Now, Beefy, you go to school
tomorrow and act normally.

269
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:55,178
Don't let anyone know you know
what's happening. This is important.

270
00:23:55,264 --> 00:24:00,816
Because once the vampires find out who you
are, you won't be hunting them any more.

271
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:03,657
You understand?
They mustn't know your name.

272
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,541
All right.

273
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:08,616
Meet me at this address
tomorrow after school.

274
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:15,379
- I have cheer leading practice, OK?
- Well, you're going to have to skip it.

275
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:21,659
They can't come in
unless you invite them in, is that true?

276
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:25,259
- That's true.
- Good.

277
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,653
Do you know what time it is?

278
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,462
- Around ten?
- I knewthis thing was slow.

279
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:44,935
You pay a fortune for something...
Honey, come on. We're gonna be late.

280
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:52,053
Wake up, sweetie. You'll be late for school.

281
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:55,172
Are we having a nightmare, Cassandra?

282
00:25:55,264 --> 00:26:00,338
He knows you're awake. Your heartbeat
sounds out to him like thunder.

283
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:07,581
Oh, my God.

284
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:14,255
Who are you?

285
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:24,976
- Hi. You're late.
- I'm gonna practise.

286
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:27,294
- Cool. See you out there.
- OK. Bye.

287
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:37,614
Oh, God! What are you doing here?
This is a naked place.

288
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:40,457
You were supposed to meet me an hour ago.

289
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:45,213
- I told you that I have practice.
- And I told you to skip it.

290
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,660
Listen, I thinkthere's been
a big mistake, all right?

291
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:52,532
I appreciate there are real vampires
and you're on this big holy mission,

292
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:57,493
but obviously somebody read
their tea leaves wrong, COs I'm notyour girl.

293
00:26:57,584 --> 00:27:01,623
And I don't think I'm up to it. And, just
between you and me, neither do you.

294
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,695
It is true.

295
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:06,981
You have missed years of training.

296
00:27:07,504 --> 00:27:10,098
- See?
- And you are undisciplined.

297
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:13,020
- Frivolous.
- Don't I know it?

298
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:16,619
Quite probably
the most vacuous choice in my entire...

299
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:19,741
OK. OK, I think we both get the point.

300
00:27:20,544 --> 00:27:24,253
Right. Well, I don't think
there's anything more for us to say.

301
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,935
I guess not.

302
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:30,304
Good luck an' all.

303
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,893
Oh, yes.

304
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:40,977
There is... one thing.

305
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,212
- What?
- This.

306
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:48,535
Bravo.

307
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:53,620
- You threw a knife at my head.
- Yes. I had to show you.

308
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:58,213
But... you threw a knife at my head.

309
00:27:58,304 --> 00:28:01,979
And you caught it.
Only the Chosen One could have caught it.

310
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:04,942
Don'tyou get it?
I don't want to be the Chosen One.

311
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:08,699
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
chasing after vampires.

312
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:14,620
All I want to do is graduate from high school,
go to Europe, marry Christian Salter and die.

313
00:28:14,704 --> 00:28:19,175
It may not sound too exciting to
a skinhead like you, but I think it's swell.

314
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:23,815
You come and tell me I'm in the hairy-mole
club so you can throwthings at me?

315
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:26,535
Beefy, it was necessary.

316
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:29,980
Last nightyou knew I was
sitting on a fresh grave, didn'tyou?

317
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:33,420
Yes, because I had to make
you aware of the implicate...

318
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:40,543
I never hit anybody before.

319
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:43,493
Really? Well, you did it perfectly.

320
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:46,375
I didn't even break a nail.

321
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,374
The heart. Remember?

322
00:30:47,704 --> 00:30:50,537
So when do I meet this guy Lottos?

323
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:56,301
I don't know. When he comes to you
in your dreams, what does he do to you?

324
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:58,693
How does he make you feel?

325
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,735
He scares me.

326
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:09,620
Well, I think we can safely say that
there's something going on with you, Buffi.

327
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:15,337
Now, there's nothing to be nervous about.

328
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:17,858
You're not in any kind of trouble.

329
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:22,460
Don't think of me
as Gary Murray, administrator.

330
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:29,700
No. Think of me as Gary Murray, party guy.
Happen dude who can talkto the young.

331
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,856
So tell me, it's...

332
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:37,062
It's drugs, isn't it?
Hey, I know where you're coming from.

333
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:40,261
Believe me, I've had my drug experiences.

334
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:44,781
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did a lot...
well, some acid in the '60s.

335
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:49,380
See, I was at a Debbie Brothers concert.

336
00:31:49,464 --> 00:31:53,173
And I could see the music flowing in.
It was flowing into me.

337
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:59,294
It was bright red and electric.
And I felt like I was a big toaster, you know.

338
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:03,741
And I thought "Well, maybe
I am a toaster, and we're all molecules."

339
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:07,339
My friend Melissa,
her head looked like a big party balloon.

340
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,575
And that... Boy, that scared me! And...

341
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:16,134
And then I started to freak out.

342
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:23,094
You said you'd have the part by two o'clock.
Christ, it's almost dark.

343
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:27,980
What nasty bug crawled up your bungs?
Where the hell are you goin'?

344
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:32,694
I'm leavin', man. I'm bailin' town.
This place has gotten way too hairy.

345
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,776
Where do I find a mechanic
stupid enough to work for my money?

346
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:38,094
- Seen Benny lately?
- No.

347
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:43,137
Hey. What, you want me
to give him a message?

348
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:45,977
You should think about leaving too, man.

349
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:51,457
Sell this place. There's something going
on here. I don't know, something real weird.

350
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:56,343
Hey, what do you want me
to do if I see Benny?

351
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,415
Run.

352
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:10,375
Nice night for a walk.

353
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:19,017
God, it's cold.

354
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,095
Dark.

355
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,375
?Feelings

356
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:38,335
?Feelings

357
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:43,377
?Boy, I'm feeling really helpless

358
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:45,455
Oh, God.

359
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:50,213
Wait.

360
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:52,295
Hello?

361
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:17,937
Toaster-caked him.

362
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:21,137
It was a trap, get it? I led him in.

363
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:26,503
It was a blind alley. Get it? If there'd been any
more of them, you would be dead by now.

364
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:29,542
You must never forget
the cardinal rule, Buffy.

365
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:33,503
One vampire is a lot easier to kill than ten.

366
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:36,178
Does the word "duh" mean anything to you?

367
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:40,863
You felt sick, didn'tyou? You had cramps.

368
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:44,973
Nice conversationalist.
Yeah, I felt them a little.

369
00:34:45,064 --> 00:34:48,500
But I'm not due for a couple of weeks,
since you're so hot on the subject.

370
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:52,941
No, of course you're not. It was
a natural reaction on the part of a slayer.

371
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,458
A reaction to their unnaturalness.

372
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:58,820
And you're going to be able
to use that to trackthem.

373
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:04,661
Great. My secret weapon is PMS.
That's just terrific. Thanks for telling me.

374
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:07,542
It's not a weapon. It's an alert system.

375
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:12,176
Well, aren't we kung fu! I don't see
you out there killing any vampires.

376
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:14,255
I play my part.

377
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:19,575
You can play with your part all you want,
but it's my neck on the block.

378
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:21,700
I'm out there risking my life.

379
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:25,459
I'm risking my life
and you're not doing anything.

380
00:35:26,864 --> 00:35:30,334
I train girls to be slayers.

381
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,983
I have done so for a hundred lives
and I shall continue to do so.

382
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:39,936
I am born each time with the knowledge
that my purpose is to prepare the...

383
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:43,061
Chosen One for her battle.

384
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:47,581
I am not a slayer,
and I must not interfere, even if I want to.

385
00:35:47,664 --> 00:35:54,376
Even if I thinkthat this time
the girl... is truly exceptional.

386
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:00,255
So...

387
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:07,742
What do you do? I mean, you just keep on
living the same old life over and over?

388
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,899
- Yes. Yes, until...
- What? Till there aren't any more vampires?

389
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:16,056
- Then what?
- Then maybe I'll go to heaven.

390
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:19,094
Or maybe you'll just get a job.

391
00:36:19,504 --> 00:36:23,656
Oh, a job. I would have been
a wonderful bootmaker.

392
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:27,134
That is so dull. I'm going to be a buyer.

393
00:36:27,784 --> 00:36:30,856
- Of what?
- I don't know. It's just a job I heard of.

394
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:32,935
Sounded pretty cool, you know.

395
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:39,853
Buying. Buyer. To buy. I like that.

396
00:36:46,944 --> 00:36:49,583
- We should go to work.
- Yeah.

397
00:36:51,224 --> 00:36:53,943
Quick, before anybody has any fun.

398
00:36:54,824 --> 00:36:59,579
Merrick, I'm not gonna croakthat easily.
I have something the other girls didn't have.

399
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:01,814
And what might that be, pray?

400
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,575
My keen fashion sense.

401
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:07,617
Vampires of the world, beware.

402
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:10,298
Merrick, you made a joke.

403
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:13,376
That's good. Are you all right?
Do you wanna lie down?

404
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,455
I know it hurts the first time.

405
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,975
It was a good joke.

406
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:26,021
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on, be good.

407
00:37:26,104 --> 00:37:28,095
Come on, come on, come on.

408
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:32,815
This is not my night.

409
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:51,534
Come on, baby. This is for the money.
Make me proud. Come on.

410
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,059
Yes. All right.

411
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:18,417
Get off my car, dude.

412
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:35,221
Come on.

413
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:38,533
Give me a break.

414
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:40,615
You ruined my new jacket.

415
00:39:41,624 --> 00:39:44,138
Kill him a lot.

416
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:07,419
Hi. Is thatyour van?

417
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,859
Yeah, why? Is there...

418
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,580
Interesting choice.

419
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:29,179
Last-minute decision.
Sorry aboutyour guitar.

420
00:40:29,624 --> 00:40:32,184
Hey. You're that weird guy.

421
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,779
- Yeah.
- You've been hurt?

422
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:42,176
Oh, no. You know what they say -
anyone who can walk away from...

423
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,300
- You knowthis guy?
- Well, somewhat.

424
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:49,933
He's rather fond of passing out
just as I happen by.

425
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:58,462
- You doin' all right? You OK?
- Yeah, I'm good.

426
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:00,853
l, you know, kinda miss my knees, though.

427
00:41:00,944 --> 00:41:03,174
You want some water or anything?

428
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:06,176
- The kitchen's in here.
- Nope. Got it covered.

429
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:21,416
So you do this a lot?
I mean, is this like a hobby for you?

430
00:41:21,504 --> 00:41:23,495
Not exactly.

431
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:27,737
They were vampires, weren't they?

432
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:33,894
- Yeah.
- God! Vampires. Unbelievable.

433
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:39,256
You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?

434
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:43,542
Yeah, I was bailin'.
I've got this friend, and he's really...

435
00:41:43,624 --> 00:41:47,776
Well, he's really a vampire, I guess.
It's not a good scene, it's a bad scene.

436
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:50,424
And tomorrow I'm on a bus. I'm outta here.

437
00:41:51,464 --> 00:41:54,137
- Wow. Are you OK?
- No, I'm fine.

438
00:41:54,224 --> 00:41:57,182
- You sure?
- It doesn't hurt.

439
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,854
I'm OK.

440
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:04,616
Who are you? I'm sorry,
butyou seemed like such a flake.

441
00:42:04,704 --> 00:42:07,582
And I mean that in a good way, really.
It's just...

442
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:11,452
Hey, I can keep talking until
you strike me dead, or not. I prefer not.

443
00:42:11,544 --> 00:42:14,934
- Things are kinda confusing.
- I'll buy that.

444
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:19,616
Three weeks ago all I could think about was...

445
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:24,016
I didn't actually think about anything.
I definitely didn't expect this.

446
00:42:24,104 --> 00:42:27,380
You know what it's like
when everything is suddenly different?

447
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:34,176
And everything you thought
was crucial seems so stupid?

448
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:40,134
You find yourself... babbling incoherently
to a strange man in your living room.

449
00:42:44,704 --> 00:42:47,935
Are you... calling me a man?

450
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:58,654
Listen, I'm gonna go to bed.

451
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:05,342
If you want to stay,
you can stay in the guest room.

452
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:09,975
No, I'll stay right here.
Make sure the sun comes up and everything.

453
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:13,895
OK.

454
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,772
I know what it's like.

455
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:31,417
You fool. You left the others behind
because of a little thing like this?

456
00:43:31,504 --> 00:43:33,495
On their first kill?

457
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:36,415
He took my arm.

458
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:42,460
It's your own fault, you reckless imbecile.

459
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:46,253
The city of angels is ours for the taking.

460
00:43:46,344 --> 00:43:52,783
Butyou... 1200 years old,
you behave like a child.

461
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:55,740
I had him in my grasp.

462
00:43:57,064 --> 00:44:00,534
Cheer up. You may still.

463
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:04,621
And do something about that arm.
It looks horrible.

464
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:09,213
Honestly, I don't know how
you made it through the crusades.

465
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:11,975
I'll be in my chamber...

466
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,175
having a little snack.

467
00:44:22,504 --> 00:44:25,860
They found Cassandra's body in the hills.

468
00:44:25,944 --> 00:44:28,663
I know. It had been there for weeks, all icky.

469
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:30,541
It's awful.

470
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:33,218
- She still had my jacket.
- The yellow leather?

471
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:36,580
- You didn't get that back from her?
- I'm so sorry.

472
00:44:37,824 --> 00:44:41,703
- I loved that jacket.
- There's a memorial service. You goin'?

473
00:44:41,784 --> 00:44:44,423
I don't know.
Coach says I gotta work on my abs.

474
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:46,540
Oh, got to get some.

475
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,982
I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.

476
00:44:56,744 --> 00:44:59,736
- Hey, what is it with you?
- Don't grab me, OK?

477
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:02,941
Absolutely. I see nowthe error of my mistake.

478
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:06,460
Hey, keep your hand off my thang.
I'll pop you one.

479
00:45:07,024 --> 00:45:10,460
- Did he scare you?
- I can take care of myself, all right?

480
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,535
So I noticed.

481
00:45:12,624 --> 00:45:16,583
- Yo, Jeff.
- It's nice to feel needed.

482
00:45:16,664 --> 00:45:18,859
- Let's move out!
- Yes!

483
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:24,382
I've missed three practices. If I'm not
at the game tomorrow, everybody will talk.

484
00:45:24,464 --> 00:45:27,297
It's just another distraction. It isn't right.

485
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:30,774
It isn't my fate? It isn't in
the Book of All Knowledgefulness

486
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:34,539
that I'll be cheering at the game tomorrow?
Lighten up, Merrick.

487
00:45:34,624 --> 00:45:37,582
None of the other girls
ever gave me this much trouble.

488
00:45:37,664 --> 00:45:40,383
And where are they now? Hello?

489
00:45:43,384 --> 00:45:48,663
If we all worktogether, together it'll all work
out! Are you with me? Now, get out there!

490
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:50,814
All right. Score some points.

491
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:56,137
Hey. You missed practice again today. Sit
down and think about howthat made me feel.

492
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:00,575
Go, team, go.

493
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:09,142
Ready? OK.

494
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:13,422
Howfunky is your chicken?
Howfunky is your chicken?

495
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,940
How loose is your goose?
Our goose is totally loose

496
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:21,178
So come on, all you Hog fans
So come on, all you Hog fans

497
00:46:21,264 --> 00:46:24,859
And shake your caboose
And shake your caboose

498
00:46:32,184 --> 00:46:36,143
Murph, come on out. You're in.
And remember, you're special.

499
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:39,500
Thanks. All right. Assertyour personhood.

500
00:46:39,584 --> 00:46:41,859
Actualise. Actualise.

501
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:52,533
More polite. More polite.

502
00:46:52,624 --> 00:46:55,422
Stagger them with your politeness.

503
00:46:55,504 --> 00:46:58,018
I'm open. Grueller?

504
00:46:58,104 --> 00:47:00,095
I'm open!

505
00:47:07,584 --> 00:47:11,975
- We can't have this. Get him out.
- It is reprehensible. The points count, right?

506
00:47:12,064 --> 00:47:14,259
- Get him out.
- Yeah, OK.

507
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:20,495
Take it, man.

508
00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:26,538
You go get him out.

509
00:47:30,304 --> 00:47:34,502
Grueller's pretty much
abandoned the concept of zones.

510
00:47:38,624 --> 00:47:40,979
There's a girl on the court.

511
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:51,379
- Buffy.
- He knows who I am.

512
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:58,416
Got a gear...

513
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:01,018
Hey, Eric. Must be half-time.

514
00:48:01,104 --> 00:48:04,540
Hey, babe. You wanna get some
real power between your legs?

515
00:48:04,624 --> 00:48:07,536
Yeah, I do.

516
00:48:07,624 --> 00:48:10,934
Dyke! You're a dyke!

517
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:13,299
I'll tell the world!

518
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:24,739
Grueller! Grueller!

519
00:48:25,504 --> 00:48:27,495
Come on!

520
00:48:35,824 --> 00:48:37,815
Come on.

521
00:49:25,144 --> 00:49:27,135
Someone get an ouchie?

522
00:49:27,224 --> 00:49:32,537
Grueller, it's me. Remember me? Buffy.
We used to hang. My birthday party?

523
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:36,253
You drank all the blueberry schnapps
and louched on my mom?

524
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:41,133
- You were my friend.
- Now I'm a god.

525
00:49:47,864 --> 00:49:50,697
And now you're a coatrack.

526
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:54,783
Geek.

527
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:56,855
Here we go.

528
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:08,700
Look. There.

529
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:19,015
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

530
00:50:19,104 --> 00:50:21,698
What am I doing here? I'm saving your butt.

531
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:26,858
Well, there was sort of an exchange of butts.
At least I didn't faint.

532
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:29,617
Pike, you shouldn't have come back.

533
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:33,776
What am I gonna do? Run?
Where am I gonna go?

534
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:39,177
These guys are everywhere, and I wanna
do some damage. I'm good with damage.

535
00:50:39,264 --> 00:50:41,778
I'd better find Merrick.

536
00:50:50,824 --> 00:50:53,577
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

537
00:50:57,184 --> 00:51:00,779
I knowthat guy.
That is a bad guy. Can we go, please?

538
00:51:00,864 --> 00:51:03,014
Has our time finally come?

539
00:51:03,704 --> 00:51:06,013
Have you ripened so fast?

540
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,618
Come closer.

541
00:51:08,704 --> 00:51:10,695
Look at me.

542
00:51:12,664 --> 00:51:15,701
Does anybody here have
a problem with this but me?

543
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,019
Come into my eyes.

544
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:25,095
Yes.

545
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:32,862
Hello? This is not a caring nurturer. He's
a bloodsucking fiend from beyond the grave.

546
00:51:33,104 --> 00:51:37,416
Will you be wagging
that jaw of yours while I'm biting it off?

547
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:39,495
Are you addressing I?

548
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:41,575
Who's ready to stop me?

549
00:51:42,624 --> 00:51:45,058
It's notyou, Merrick.

550
00:51:45,424 --> 00:51:50,498
You finally brought me someone real.
But is she ready?

551
00:51:50,784 --> 00:51:53,856
Well, actually, she's quite a pain in the ass.

552
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,219
- What a pity.
- Your move, Merrick.

553
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:02,214
Come on, Lefty. Remember what happened
the last time you messed with me?

554
00:52:02,304 --> 00:52:05,501
- I remember.
- Shit.

555
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:11,013
She's not ready for you, Lothos.

556
00:52:11,424 --> 00:52:15,656
That's too bad. I had such high hopes.

557
00:52:16,304 --> 00:52:18,454
Close your eyes.

558
00:52:20,064 --> 00:52:22,180
No! Not this one.

559
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:25,742
Lothos.

560
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:34,460
Ashes to ashes.

561
00:52:39,144 --> 00:52:41,658
Oh, look.

562
00:52:41,744 --> 00:52:44,338
Look... what I've done.

563
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,532
Dust to dust.

564
00:52:50,624 --> 00:52:53,263
- We're leaving.
- We're not eating?

565
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,335
She's not ready.

566
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:00,055
God.

567
00:53:00,904 --> 00:53:02,895
- Stay still.
- I am still.

568
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:06,695
I'll getyou some help.

569
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:13,338
You...

570
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:16,621
You do everything wrong.

571
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:22,612
Sorry. I take it back.

572
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:24,695
No.

573
00:53:25,504 --> 00:53:27,813
Do it wrong.

574
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:31,214
Don't play our game.

575
00:53:32,064 --> 00:53:37,741
Lothos is a... is a show.

576
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:40,699
Remember about the music.

577
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,775
Listen.

578
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:49,700
When the music stops, the rest is...

579
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:56,303
Merrick? Merrick?

580
00:54:43,544 --> 00:54:46,217
It really was mondo bizarro.

581
00:54:46,304 --> 00:54:51,298
When she ran out onto the court, wasn't it
the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?

582
00:54:51,384 --> 00:54:53,375
No. Way mental.

583
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:59,022
- Oh, hi, Buffy.
- Hi, guys.

584
00:54:59,104 --> 00:55:01,493
You were supposed to be here at three.

585
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:05,893
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I forgot.
- Buffy, what is your sitch?

586
00:55:05,984 --> 00:55:09,340
You're acting like a thing from
another tax bracket. It's too weird.

587
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:12,302
Listen, a lot's been going on, guys, OK?

588
00:55:12,384 --> 00:55:15,820
And I really wanted
to talkto you guys about it.

589
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:21,861
See, a couple of weeks ago, I met this guy...

590
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,458
Oh, my God. You're having an affair?

591
00:55:24,544 --> 00:55:26,535
- Cool.
- Does Jeffrey know?

592
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:32,421
It's not about that. He's, like, old. He's 50.

593
00:55:35,024 --> 00:55:36,423
- Sick.
- Gross.

594
00:55:36,504 --> 00:55:41,294
Haven'tyou guys noticed what's been
going on here? The strange things?

595
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:45,692
Haven'tyou noticed people disappearing?
Turning up dead?

596
00:55:45,784 --> 00:55:47,979
- What are you talking about?
- Weird.

597
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:51,420
You mean, like, hanging out
with that homeless Poke?

598
00:55:51,504 --> 00:55:53,540
Pike.

599
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:58,893
- You're having an affair with him?
- He doesn't look 50.

600
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:02,818
Guys, I think reality stepped
out of here about five minutes ago.

601
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:05,896
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah. Like you've got a grip.

602
00:56:05,984 --> 00:56:10,341
You're out of it. Jennifer says you've
blown off cheerleading and dance committee.

603
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:13,143
Excuse me for having
something important to do.

604
00:56:13,224 --> 00:56:17,058
And this isn't important?
This happens to be the dance.

605
00:56:17,144 --> 00:56:18,975
Right. It's a dance.

606
00:56:19,064 --> 00:56:23,819
It's a stupid dance with a bunch
of stupid people that I see every stupid day.

607
00:56:23,904 --> 00:56:26,020
Like, now we're, like, stupid?

608
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:29,221
You know, Buffy,
this doesn't happen to be just any dance.

609
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:32,740
It happens to be
the last dance of our lastyear.

610
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:35,133
- Except for the semiformal.
- Right.

611
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:37,499
- And the totally formal.
- Oh, yeah.

612
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:40,052
- Oh, yeah. And the senior prom.
- OK!

613
00:56:40,144 --> 00:56:44,057
Buffy, if you wanna play house
with the unwashed masses, that's fine.

614
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:48,217
But, personally, I think you should
spend a little time prioritising.

615
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:52,138
- What language are you speaking?
- Get out of my facial.

616
00:56:56,424 --> 00:56:59,814
Well, I guess you got whatyou came for.

617
00:57:01,464 --> 00:57:03,819
- Nic...
- Later for it.

618
00:57:06,144 --> 00:57:08,260
Jen?

619
00:57:20,344 --> 00:57:25,259
Buff! Hey, Buff. Whatyou been doing?
I've been looking all over for you.

620
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:27,858
I'm going shopping.
Don't try and stop me, OK?

621
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,299
Cool. I need Allen wrenches.
What do you need?

622
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:32,375
- Dress.
- For what?

623
00:57:32,464 --> 00:57:34,455
- Dance.
- Come again?

624
00:57:34,544 --> 00:57:36,580
I'm going to the senior dance.

625
00:57:36,664 --> 00:57:39,258
The second word sounds like "dance".

626
00:57:39,344 --> 00:57:43,496
- I'm going to the dance.
- For what?

627
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:46,860
In order to dance, drink punch,
be with my friends, comprende?

628
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:52,621
No. The world is under attack by legions
of the undead and you're going to a mixer?

629
00:57:52,704 --> 00:57:56,253
It's a senior dance. It's important.
You wouldn't understand.

630
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:59,177
No, I wouldn't.
I thoughtyou wanted to kill vampires.

631
00:57:59,264 --> 00:58:04,179
I don't wanna kill anybody, OK?
And I don't wanna talk about this any more.

632
00:58:04,264 --> 00:58:08,177
- What about Merrick? Is that what he'd want?
- Merrick's dead.

633
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,334
Cheap shot.

634
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:15,020
He's dead because of me. Because
I couldn't lift a hand against Lothos.

635
00:58:15,104 --> 00:58:17,095
I'm in way over my head.

636
00:58:17,184 --> 00:58:21,063
Look, life's a bitch. I'll give you that.
But, Buffy, you're the guy.

637
00:58:21,144 --> 00:58:23,135
You are the chosen guy.

638
00:58:23,824 --> 00:58:27,863
Right. I'm the Chosen One.
And I choose to be shopping.

639
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:32,333
- Yeah, I should have known.
- So leave me alone, all right?

640
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:38,697
Benny was right. You're all the same.
I'm not disappointed, just angry.

641
00:58:52,344 --> 00:58:54,335
Buffy?

642
00:59:03,504 --> 00:59:07,019
- Buffy.
- Lay out my suit.

643
00:59:07,104 --> 00:59:09,299
We will be attending a dance.

644
00:59:09,384 --> 00:59:12,581
Dance? Master, what are we waiting for?

645
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:15,974
The Slayer is unmasked. Let's finish it.

646
00:59:16,064 --> 00:59:18,942
- We'll wait until Saturday.
- Why?

647
00:59:19,024 --> 00:59:23,222
Because I want to dance.

648
00:59:24,464 --> 00:59:26,455
I am yours to command.

649
01:00:36,544 --> 01:00:38,535
Nice outfit.

650
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:42,262
This one doesn't have a mirror at home?

651
01:00:56,264 --> 01:00:59,859
- Have you seen Jeffrey?
- If I say no, are you gonna hurt me?

652
01:01:01,104 --> 01:01:03,459
- No.
- No.

653
01:01:10,184 --> 01:01:12,175
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

654
01:01:13,064 --> 01:01:19,458
Have you seen Jeffrey? Cos the limo didn't
show up, and I thought maybe he'd be here.

655
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:23,615
What?

656
01:01:26,504 --> 01:01:29,541
- Jeffrey, there you are.
- Buffy, what are you doing here?

657
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:32,855
I thought we were gonna come here together.

658
01:01:32,944 --> 01:01:34,935
I'm here with Jenny.

659
01:01:38,384 --> 01:01:41,581
- I don't get it.
- Come on, Buffy. You know what's going on.

660
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,098
It's not working out at all.

661
01:01:44,184 --> 01:01:46,778
I gotta move on. I got needs too.

662
01:01:48,064 --> 01:01:52,182
- I told you about all this.
- No, you didn't.

663
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:55,177
- Didn'tyou get my message?
- You left me a message?

664
01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:57,459
You weren't home. Like always.

665
01:01:57,824 --> 01:02:01,180
- You broke up with my machine?
- I'm outta here. Jenny.

666
01:02:02,224 --> 01:02:04,215
Jenny! We're leaving!

667
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:19,695
God. Pike.

668
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:22,380
I crashed your party.

669
01:03:22,464 --> 01:03:26,457
- How shallow of you.
- Yeah, well, I'm pretty shallow.

670
01:03:28,344 --> 01:03:30,221
I'm glad you came.

671
01:03:30,304 --> 01:03:35,583
You seemed to be having a swell time,
Queen of the Cardboard Jungle.

672
01:03:40,504 --> 01:03:43,496
Would I get my ass kicked
if I asked you to dance?

673
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:48,495
Maybe.

674
01:04:05,544 --> 01:04:09,253
You know, Buffy, you're not like other girls.

675
01:04:13,664 --> 01:04:15,655
Yes, I am.

676
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:56,015
I can't believe it.

677
01:05:05,744 --> 01:05:07,780
Is somebody kidding?

678
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:18,016
Oh, man. There were
vampires out there, man.

679
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:23,822
Oh, my God!

680
01:05:24,184 --> 01:05:26,175
OK. Nobody go near the door.

681
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,018
Party time!

682
01:05:31,664 --> 01:05:35,657
Don't worry. They can't come in
unless they're invited.

683
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:37,935
I already invited 'em.

684
01:05:39,824 --> 01:05:41,894
They're seniors.

685
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,576
Buffy!

686
01:05:43,664 --> 01:05:45,939
You wanna dance?

687
01:05:46,024 --> 01:05:49,619
We want her. We want Buffy. Send her out.

688
01:05:49,704 --> 01:05:52,218
Or we'll come in.

689
01:05:52,304 --> 01:05:56,695
Hey. I have detention slips here
and I'm not afraid to use 'em.

690
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:00,974
We got a problem.

691
01:06:02,464 --> 01:06:05,854
I got a bag full of solutions.
What are we gonna do about it?

692
01:06:05,944 --> 01:06:08,219
- You're staying here.
- What?

693
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:11,182
If they come in here,
it's gonna turn into a total stain.

694
01:06:11,264 --> 01:06:13,380
Yeah, you say it like it's a bad thing.

695
01:06:13,464 --> 01:06:16,058
It's a good thing one of us was prepared.

696
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:21,216
- I'm not gonna letyou out there by yourself.
- Don't piss me off.

697
01:06:22,904 --> 01:06:25,099
Buffy!

698
01:06:25,544 --> 01:06:27,421
Hey, Buff.

699
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:02,422
It's OK. I thinkthey're going after her.

700
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:11,502
- Jeffrey.
- That was quick.

701
01:07:12,144 --> 01:07:14,135
Run, Buffy. Run.

702
01:07:23,224 --> 01:07:25,419
Look out, dude.

703
01:07:37,544 --> 01:07:39,694
Hi. How's it going?

704
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:45,299
I'm fine. Butyou're obviously
having a bad-hair day.

705
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:47,855
Funny.

706
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:13,574
Or she could go for what's behind
door number three.

707
01:08:35,064 --> 01:08:37,055
This party sucks, man.

708
01:08:40,744 --> 01:08:43,212
Come on, come on. Fight like a man.

709
01:08:51,104 --> 01:08:56,098
Isn't it great, Pike? Isn't it great?
Finally got those bitches on the run.

710
01:08:56,864 --> 01:09:01,062
Honestly, I leave you alone for five minutes
and look who you're hangin' out with.

711
01:09:01,144 --> 01:09:04,056
It doesn't have to be that way.
I could still change you.

712
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:06,135
Give me a break, Benny.

713
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:09,703
Why do you like these people? They're sheep.

714
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:16,376
Oh, forget them. Live for ever.
We could start a band.

715
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:24,815
I'll getyou, Buffy. And your little dog, too.
I just don't know what he sees in you.

716
01:09:24,904 --> 01:09:28,453
You don't really think
you can stand up to him, do you?

717
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:33,743
Admit it, Buffy. Aren't there times
when you just feel less than fresh?

718
01:09:37,504 --> 01:09:39,859
You're pathetic.

719
01:09:39,944 --> 01:09:42,333
You're not even fit to die for him.

720
01:09:43,144 --> 01:09:45,453
We're immortal, Buffy.

721
01:09:46,024 --> 01:09:48,094
We can do anything.

722
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,175
Oh, yeah? Clap.

723
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,893
You're gonna wish you'd died.

724
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,258
You knowthis is our night.

725
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,178
I do.

726
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,659
- It was good, wasn't it?
- What?

727
01:10:57,744 --> 01:11:01,737
Killing him. So intimate.

728
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:07,023
Your first real kill, and my last gift to him.

729
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:10,532
- Where is she?
- She's meat for the beast.

730
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:14,096
The Master wants her.
And Uncle Sam wants you.

731
01:11:17,984 --> 01:11:21,056
- Things change, Ben.
- What's up with that, Pike?

732
01:11:27,744 --> 01:11:32,898
It's time to put away childish things.

733
01:11:44,904 --> 01:11:46,895
Silence.

734
01:11:51,704 --> 01:11:53,854
Look at me.

735
01:11:53,944 --> 01:11:57,141
The rest is silence. That's it.

736
01:11:57,224 --> 01:12:01,012
- What?
- Merricktold me. I knew it all along.

737
01:12:04,264 --> 01:12:06,255
The music stopped.

738
01:12:07,904 --> 01:12:09,895
Look at me.

739
01:12:12,064 --> 01:12:15,852
- It's too late.
- You and I are one.

740
01:12:17,144 --> 01:12:20,659
One what? Cute couple? I don't think so.

741
01:12:23,504 --> 01:12:25,654
You and I... Look at me.

742
01:12:25,744 --> 01:12:28,258
You and I are joined.

743
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,302
We're joined? Please!

744
01:12:31,864 --> 01:12:34,458
You stupid little bitch!

745
01:12:34,544 --> 01:12:36,500
How are you gonna stop me?

746
01:12:36,864 --> 01:12:40,220
I am life beyond death.

747
01:12:40,304 --> 01:12:44,582
And you are just like the other girls.

748
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,700
Maybe I'll surprise you.

749
01:12:47,344 --> 01:12:50,302
This is your defence? Please!

750
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,418
- Your puny faith?
- No.

751
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:56,699
My keen fashion sense.

752
01:13:03,824 --> 01:13:05,815
Detention.

753
01:13:06,504 --> 01:13:11,703
Detention, detention, detention.

754
01:13:11,784 --> 01:13:17,416
Detention, detention. I thinkthat's all of'em.
Nope! Detention, detention.

755
01:13:17,504 --> 01:13:20,462
Hey, look. It's Buffy.

756
01:13:20,544 --> 01:13:24,935
Buffy? No, no! Don't let her in.
They'll kill us! Please keep her out!

757
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:37,337
Buffy. I didn't think I was gonna
see you again. Are you all right?

758
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:41,733
Get out of my way. Find my friend Pike.

759
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:52,334
I'll have you beg.

760
01:13:52,424 --> 01:13:56,178
Split open like rotted fruit, all of you.

761
01:13:56,864 --> 01:13:59,173
That is definitely not a student.

762
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,493
You are my destiny.

763
01:14:07,024 --> 01:14:09,094
I could never hurtyou.

764
01:14:18,104 --> 01:14:23,224
I'm gonna send you screaming
to the pits of hell. Trust me!

765
01:14:37,024 --> 01:14:39,538
I haven't finished with you, bitch.

766
01:14:56,144 --> 01:14:58,135
I got him!

767
01:15:06,184 --> 01:15:08,493
Well, I had him.

768
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:14,020
No, no, no, no.

769
01:15:23,944 --> 01:15:26,777
Now I'm really pissed off.

770
01:15:28,144 --> 01:15:30,533
Good!

771
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:33,974
Oops.

772
01:15:47,864 --> 01:15:49,582
Pike?

773
01:15:57,744 --> 01:15:59,939
Pike.

774
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:03,615
I used to be.

775
01:16:05,824 --> 01:16:07,815
Sorry.

776
01:16:09,184 --> 01:16:11,254
You OK?

777
01:16:11,344 --> 01:16:14,461
Yeah, I'm all right. Are you OK?

778
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:16,614
I can't move my legs.

779
01:16:16,704 --> 01:16:19,218
- Why?
- Cos you're sitting on 'em.

780
01:16:22,584 --> 01:16:25,223
OK, come on. I'll help you up.

781
01:16:35,704 --> 01:16:37,695
Did I do all of that?

782
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:41,215
No.

783
01:16:41,304 --> 01:16:43,340
Did you do all of that?

784
01:16:43,424 --> 01:16:45,415
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

785
01:16:57,144 --> 01:16:59,135
I saved you a dance.

786
01:17:02,304 --> 01:17:04,295
You gonna ask me?

787
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,859
- I suppose you wanna lead?
- No.

788
01:17:16,704 --> 01:17:18,695
Me neither.

789
01:17:20,504 --> 01:17:22,495
This is a good thing.

790
01:18:31,824 --> 01:18:35,453
...and laid siege, if you will,
to the Hemery senior dance.

791
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,297
They hadfangs, they were biting people.

792
01:18:38,384 --> 01:18:42,377
They had this look in their eyes.
Totally cold. Animal.

793
01:18:43,464 --> 01:18:45,455
I think they were Young Republicans.

794
01:18:45,544 --> 01:18:50,413
It was like a nightmare in there.
Of course, I had to keep my head, but...

795
01:18:50,504 --> 01:18:52,734
I've been there, you know.

796
01:18:52,824 --> 01:18:55,258
Yeah. I saw a lot of action in Nam.

797
01:18:56,664 --> 01:18:59,053
Well, I saw "Platoon".

798
01:18:59,744 --> 01:19:03,498
I'm very happy to accept this honour,

799
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:08,817
and I will try very hard to fulfiil
my needs as your nextMiss America.

800
01:19:08,904 --> 01:19:13,182
I do think the students learned
a valuable lesson about safety.

801
01:19:14,304 --> 01:19:18,183
Except the dead ones,
I mean, of course. Well, they learned it.

802
01:19:18,264 --> 01:19:22,815
But they really didn't have time
to implement it, you know, and...

803
01:19:24,304 --> 01:19:26,579
Are we live?

804
01:19:26,664 --> 01:19:30,976
Well, lfelt something was wrong,
so we really got outta there before...

805
01:19:31,064 --> 01:19:34,818
I mean, I heard stuff.
We were nearby. We heard...

806
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:37,543
I can't believe I letyou do that to me.

807
01:19:41,824 --> 01:19:46,659
Details are still sketchy
as to exactly who is responsible.

808
01:19:46,744 --> 01:19:51,181
Gang members? Cultists?
Everyone seemed to see something different.

809
01:19:51,264 --> 01:19:54,540
This is Liz Smith in Los Angeles.
