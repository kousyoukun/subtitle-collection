1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,181
I'm not happy, pet.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,600
Angel and the Slayer are still alive.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,187
They know where we are and about
the Judge. We should be vacating.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,732
Nonsense. They'll not disturb us here.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,694
My Angel's too smart to face the Judge again.

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,031
What's Big Blue up to anyway?
He just sits there.

7
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,493
I am preparing.

8
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,871
Yeah.

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,668
It's interesting to me that preparing
looks a bit like sitting on your ass.

10
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,005
- When do we destroy the world already?
- My strength grows.

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,592
And with every life I take,
it will increase further.

12
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,387
So let's take some. I'm bored.

13
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,855
- Angel?
- Dru? What is it?

14
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,774
Dru!

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,822
Darling, do you see something?

16
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,558
Angel?

17
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,814
Buffy!

18
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,819
Oh, no.

19
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,460
Hey.

20
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,214
Are you OK?

21
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,593
You want me to call 911?

22
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,680
No. The pain is gone.

23
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,934
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,485
I feel just fine.

25
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,353
Morning!

26
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,107
- Morning.
- So, did you have fun last night?

27
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,526
- Fun?
- At Willow's.

28
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,531
Yeah! Yeah.
Fun at Willow's. She's a fun machine.

29
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,284
- Are you hungry?
- No.

30
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,870
No, I'm just gonna go take a shower.

31
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,415
- Well, if you hurry, I'll run you to school.
- Thanks.

32
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,252
Is something wrong?

33
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,963
No! What would be wrong?

34
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,592
I don't know. You just look...

35
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:35,192
The bus depot was a total washout. And may
I say, what a lovely place to spend the night.

36
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,945
What a vibrant cross section of Americana.

37
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,322
No vampires transporting boxes?

38
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,699
No, but a 400lb wino offered to wash my hair.

39
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,122
- What's up? Where's Buffy?
- She never checked in.

40
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,544
If the bus depot's as empty
as the docks and the airport...

41
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,338
Do you think this Judge
has been assembled?

42
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,423
- Yes.
- Buffy could be...

43
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,929
We gotta find him. We gotta go to that place,
that factory. That's where they're holed up.

44
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,766
- Let's go.
- And do what? Besides be afraid and die.

45
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,478
Nobody's asking you to go. If the
vampires need grooming tips, we'll call you.

46
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,399
Cordelia has a point.
If Buffy and Angel were...

47
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,861
.. harmed, we don't stand to fare much better.

48
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,447
Yeah? Those of us with feelings
are gonna do somethin'.

49
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,741
- Xander!
- No, Xander's right.

50
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,912
My God! You people are all... I'm upset
and I can't think of a mean word right now,...

51
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,875
.. but that's what you are,
and we're goin' in the factory.

52
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,170
- Buffy!
- We were just going to rescue you.

53
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,006
- Well, some of us were.
- Well, I would have.

54
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,009
- Where's Angel?
- He didn't check in with you guys?

55
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,136
- No.
- What happened?

56
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:49,224
- The Judge, is he...
- No assembly required. He's active.

57
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,686
- Damn it.
- Nearly killed us.

58
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,856
- Angel got us out.
- Why didn't you call? We thought...

59
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,901
Well, we had to hide.

60
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:04,156
We got stuck in the sewer tunnels
and, with the hiding, we just split up.

61
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,492
- No one's heard from him?
- I'm sure he'll come by.

62
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,787
- Yeah. I'm sure you're right.
- Buffy.

63
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,916
- The Judge, we must stop him.
- I know.

64
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,543
- What can you tell us?
- Not much. I, um...

65
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,881
I kicked him. It was just like a sudden fever.
If he got his hands on me...

66
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:26,595
He won't need to. The stronger he gets, he'll
be able to reduce us to charcoal with a look.

67
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,473
Also, not the prettiest man in town.

68
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,435
I'll continue researching.
Look for a weak spot.

69
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,896
The rest of you should get to your classes.

70
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,940
Yeah, I better go too.

71
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,944
- I'll try the Net for anything on the Judge.
- Thank you.

72
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,238
After classes I'll come and help you.

73
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,533
You might find something useful
if it's in I Can Read Book,

74
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,043
You don't think Angel would have
gone after the Judge himself?

75
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,504
No. He'd know better than that.

76
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,006
Maybe he just needed...

77
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,300
I don't know. I just wish he'd contact me.

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,595
I need to talk to him.

79
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,861
Are we feeling better, then?

80
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,031
I'm naming all the stars.

81
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,951
You can't see the stars, love.

82
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:35,164
That's the ceiling. Also, it's day.

83
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,875
I can see them.

84
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,627
But I've named them all the same name.

85
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,716
And there's terrible confusion.

86
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,386
Did you see any further?
Do you know what happens to Angel?

87
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,221
Well...

88
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,850
He moves to New York
and tries to fulfil that Broadway dream.

89
00:07:55,601 --> 00:08:01,023
It's tough slaying, but one day he's working
in the chorus when the star twists her ankle.

90
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,402
- You don't give up, do you?
- As long as there's injustice in the world.

91
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,156
As long as scum like you is walking...

92
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,785
.. well, rolling... the streets, I'll be around.

93
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,705
Look over your shoulder. I'll be there.

94
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,209
Yeah.

95
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,046
Angel... um, look over your shoulder.

96
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,636
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Well, you know, it kind of itches a little.

97
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,765
- Don't just stand there. Burn him!
- Gee! Maybe he's broken.

98
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,770
- What the hell is going on?
- This one cannot be burned.

99
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,606
- He's clean.
- Clean?

100
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,443
- You mean he's...
- There's no humanity in him.

101
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,822
I couldn't have said it better myself.

102
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,117
- Angel.
- Yeah, baby.

103
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,496
I'm back.

104
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,668
- Is it really true?
- It's really true.

105
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,254
You've come home.

106
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,507
No more of this "I've got a soul" crap.

107
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,885
What can I say, hm?

108
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,681
I was goin' through a phase.

109
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,517
This is great! This is so great.

110
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,562
Everything in my head is singing.

111
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,399
We're family again.

112
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,734
We'll feed...

113
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,028
.. and we'll play.

114
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,826
I've gotta tell you. It made me sick to my
stomach seeing you be the Slayer's lapdog.

115
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,712
- How did this happen?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

116
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,298
Who cares? What matters is now he's back.

117
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,594
Now it's four against one,
which are the kind of odds I like to play.

118
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,974
We're going to destroy the world.
Want to come?

119
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,352
Yeah, destroying the world.

120
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,189
Great. I'm really more interested in the Slayer.

121
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,567
Well, she's in the world,
so that should work out.

122
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,819
- Give me tonight.
- What do you mean?

123
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,655
Lay low for a night.

124
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:17,910
I guarantee, by the time you go public,
she won't be anything resembling a threat.

125
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,372
You've really got a yen
to hurt this girl, haven't you?

126
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,083
She made me feel like a human being.

127
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,213
That's not the kinda thing you just forgive.

128
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,050
OK. No. No, we didn't but I'm sure he'll...

129
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:38,555
Well, Buffy, he probably has some plan
and he's trying to protect you.

130
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,893
Well, I don't know what.
I'm not in on the plan. It's his plan.

131
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,979
No! Don't even say that.

132
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,649
- Angel is not dead.
- Say hi for me.

133
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,736
Yeah, of course we'll be here. OK. Bye.

134
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,823
- "Say hi for me"?
- What's the word?

135
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:01,912
She's checked every place she could think
of. She even beat up Willy the Snitch twice.

136
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,249
- Angel's vanished.
- But he does do that on occasion, no?

137
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,378
Well, yeah. But she's extra-wigged this time.

138
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,713
I guess cos of her dreams.

139
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,258
What if something really happened to him?

140
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,345
- Is she gonna join us here?
- Yeah, she's just stopping at home first.

141
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,098
Nada,

142
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,605
Did you find anything?

143
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,525
This book mentions the Judge,
but nothing useful.

144
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:35,946
"Big, scary, no weapon forged can stop him.
Took an army to take him down. "

145
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,198
Blah blah blah.

146
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,534
We need some insight. A weak spot.

147
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,536
Well, we're not gonna find it here.

148
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:51,003
- Sorry I snapped at you before.
- I'm reeling from that new experience.

149
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,672
I was crazed. I wasn't thinking.

150
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,217
I know. You were too busy rushing off
to die for your beloved Buffy.

151
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,929
- You'd never die for me.
- No, I might die from you.

152
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,515
- Does that get me any points?
- No!

153
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,853
- Come on, can't we just kiss and make up?
- I don't wanna make up.

154
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,481
But I'm OK with the other part.

155
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,455
Willow! We were just... Willow! Willow!

156
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,504
- Willow, come on!
- I knew it! I knew it!

157
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:38,467
Well, I didn't have the slightest idea,
but I knew there was something I didn't know.

158
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,929
You two were fighting way too much!
It's not natural.

159
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,099
- I know it's weird.
- Weird? It's against all laws of God and man.

160
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,727
It's Cordelia! Remember?

161
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,813
The "We Hate Cordelia Club",
of which you are the treasurer?

162
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,192
- I was gonna tell you.
- What stopped you? Could it be shame?

163
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,236
- Let's overreact!
- But...

164
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,364
Willow. We were just kissing.
It doesn't mean that much.

165
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,868
No.

166
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,122
It just means that you'd rather be
with someone you hate... than be with me.

167
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,921
- Angel!
- Hey.

168
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,925
Oh, my God! I was so worried.

169
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,636
I didn't mean to frighten you.

170
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,722
- Where did you go?
- Been around.

171
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,101
Oh, my God.

172
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,478
I was freaking out. You just disappeared!

173
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,064
What? I took off.

174
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,613
But you didn't say anything. You just left.

175
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,867
Yeah. Like I really wanted
to stick around after that.

176
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,913
- What?
- You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo.

177
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,166
Although I guess you proved that last night.

178
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,712
- Are you saying...
- Let's not make an issue out of it, OK?

179
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,840
In fact, let's not talk about it at all.

180
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,927
- It happened.
- I don't understand.

181
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,100
Was it... me? Was I not good?

182
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:57,147
You were great. Really.
I thought you were a pro.

183
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,775
How can you say this to me?

184
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:04,154
Lighten up. It was a good time.
It doesn't mean we have to make a big deal.

185
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,074
- It is a big deal!
- It's what?

186
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,284
Bells ringing? Fireworks?

187
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,120
A dulcet choir of pretty little birdies?

188
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:17,584
Come on, Buffy.
It's not like I've never been there before.

189
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,755
Don't touch me.

190
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,009
I should have known
you wouldn't be able to handle it.

191
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,263
Angel!

192
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,268
I love you.

193
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,229
I love you, too.

194
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,775
I'll call you.

195
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,036
You know what it is, this vengeance?

196
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:57,291
Uncle, I have served you.
I have been faithful. I need to know.

197
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,794
To the modern man,
vengeance is a word, an idea.

198
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:05,090
Payback. One thing for another.
Like commerce.

199
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,759
Not with us.

200
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,137
Vengeance is a living thing.

201
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,472
It passes through generations.

202
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,433
It commands. It kills.

203
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,854
You told me to watch Angel. You told me
to keep him from the Slayer. I tried.

204
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:24,234
But there are other factors. Terrible things
are happening here that we cannot control.

205
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,488
We control nothing. We are not wizards, Jana.

206
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,699
We merely play a part.

207
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,994
Angel could be of help to us.

208
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,247
He may be the only chance
we have to stop the Judge.

209
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,750
It is too late for that.

210
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,128
- Why?
- The curse.

211
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,172
Angel was meant to suffer.

212
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,841
Not to live as human.

213
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,011
One moment of true happiness,
of contentment,...

214
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:57,184
.. one moment where the soul that we
restored no longer plagues his thoughts,...

215
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,062
.. and that soul is taken from him.

216
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,148
Then, if somehow, if...

217
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,983
If it's happened,...

218
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,572
-.. then Angelus is back.
- I hoped to stop it,...

219
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,660
.. but I realise now it was arranged to be so.

220
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,664
- Buffy loves him.
- And now she will have to kill him.

221
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,708
Unless he kills her first!
Uncle, this is insanity!

222
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,045
People are going to die.

223
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,881
Yes. It is not justice we serve.

224
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,468
It is vengeance.

225
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,599
You're a fool. We're all fools.

226
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,030
Will.

227
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,409
Hey.

228
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,828
- Where'd you go?
- Home.

229
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,498
I'm glad you came back.
We can't do this without you.

230
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:06,503
Let's get this straight. I don't understand it.
I don't wanna understand it.

231
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:11,425
You have gross emotional problems...
and things are not OK between us.

232
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,723
But... what's happening right now
is more important than that.

233
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:21,643
OK.

234
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:29,776
- What about the Judge? Where do we stand?
- On a pile of books that say the same thing.

235
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,280
- Let me guess. "No weapon forged... "
- "It took an army... "

236
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,116
Yeah, where's an army when you need one?

237
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,538
- What?
- Whoa. Whoa!

238
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,458
I think I'm havin' a thought.

239
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,335
Yeah, yeah, that's a thought.

240
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,463
Now I'm having a plan.

241
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,133
Now I'm havin' a wiggins.

242
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,134
What's going on?

243
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,053
- Let's get to the library.
- Willow!

244
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:57,930
- Xander.
- Angel.

245
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,308
Thank God you're OK. Did you see Buffy?

246
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,019
Yeah. What's up with the lights?

247
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,355
I don't know. Listen, I have an idea.

248
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,483
Forget about that now.
I got somethin' to show you.

249
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,778
- Show us?
- Yeah. Xander, go get the others.

250
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,488
OK.

251
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,074
And, Willow, come here.

252
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,788
- What is it, Angel?
- It's amazing.

253
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,549
- Willow, get away from him!
- What?

254
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,635
- Walk to me.
- What are you talking about?

255
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,640
- Don't do that!
- Oh, I think I do that.

256
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,352
- Angel!
- He's not Angel any more.

257
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,856
- Are you?
- Wrong.

258
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,191
I am Angel... at last.

259
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,570
- Oh, my God.
- I got a message for Buffy.

260
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,531
Why don't you give it to me yourself?

261
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,825
It's not really the kind of message you tell.

262
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,245
It sort of involves finding
the bodies of all your friends.

263
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,916
- This can't be you.
- We already covered that subject.

264
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:11,211
Angel, there must be some part
of you that remembers who you are.

265
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,215
Dream on, schoolgirl. Your boyfriend is dead.

266
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,636
- You're all gonna join him.
- Leave Willow alone and deal with me.

267
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,641
But she's so cute and helpless.
It's really a turn-on.

268
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,735
Things are about to get very interesting.

269
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,039
Buffy, are you OK?

270
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,792
Buffy?

271
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:03,514
And we're absolutely certain
that Angel has reverted to his former self?

272
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,725
Yeah. We're all certain.
Anyone not feeling certain here?

273
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,228
Giles, you wouldn't have believed him.

274
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:13,065
He was so... He came here to kill us.

275
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,109
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm leaning towards blind panic.

276
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,280
- Rupert, don't talk like that. The kids...
- I'm sorry.

277
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,742
Things are bad enough with the Judge here.

278
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,287
Angel crossing over to the other side...
I wasn't prepared for that.

279
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,581
None of us were.

280
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,966
Are you OK?

281
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,220
Is there anything I can do?

282
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,848
I should have known.

283
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,228
I saw him at the house. He was different.
The things he said...

284
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,566
- What things?
- It's private.

285
00:21:56,525 --> 00:22:00,404
- But you didn't know he had turned bad?
- How did you?

286
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,158
- What?
- Well, you knew.

287
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:08,162
- You told me to get away from him.
- Well, I saw his face.

288
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,790
If only we knew how it happened.

289
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:18,839
- What do you mean?
- Some event must have triggered it.

290
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,800
If anyone would know, Buffy,
it should be you.

291
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,428
- I don't...
- Did anything happen last night...

292
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:28,515
- Giles, please! I can't...
- Buffy, I'm sorry, but we can't afford to...

293
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,893
- Buffy!
- Giles, shut up.

294
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,611
This is great. An unkillable demon
is in town. Angel's joined his team.

295
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,156
The Slayer's a basket case.
I'd say we've hit bottom.

296
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,075
- I have a plan.
- Oh, no! Here's a lower place.

297
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,370
I don't know about Angel,
but I may have a way to deal with the Judge.

298
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,415
- What do we do?
- I think, um...

299
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,294
I think I may need Cordelia for this one.

300
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,300
- And we may need wheels.
- Well, my car is...

301
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:08,013
- It might have to be bigger.
- No problem. I'll get Oz. He has a van.

302
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,141
Good.

303
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,226
OK.

304
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:14,394
- Care to let me in on the plan I'm a part of?
- No.

305
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,856
- Why not?
- Because if I tell you, then you won't do it.

306
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,818
Just meet me at Willow's house in half
an hour and wear something trashy... er.

307
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,824
I'm not sure what we should do about Buffy.

308
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,244
Assuming they don't attack tonight,
we should let her be.

309
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:31,995
I agree.

310
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,498
I... I can imagine what she's going through.

311
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,042
No... I don't think you can.

312
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:44,758
You should have seen her face.
It was priceless! I'll never forget it.

313
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,928
- So you didn't kill her, then?
- Course not.

314
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,933
Now, I know you haven't been
in the game for a while, mate,...

315
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,727
.. but we still do kill people.

316
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,272
It's sort of our raison d'être, you know?

317
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,817
You don't wanna kill her, do you?

318
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,654
You want to hurt her,...

319
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,823
.. just like you hurt me.

320
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:12,452
- Nobody knows me like you do, Dru.
- She'd better not get in our way.

321
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,330
- Don't worry about it.
- I do.

322
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:18,000
Spike... my boy!

323
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,628
You really don't get it, do you?

324
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:27,885
You tried to kill her, but you couldn't.
Look at you, you're a wreck!

325
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:31,889
She's stronger than any Slayer
you've ever faced.

326
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,766
Force won't get it done.

327
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,477
You gotta work from the inside.

328
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:42,191
To kill this girl, you have to love her.

329
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,847
I love you.

330
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,235
You have to know what to see.

331
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:21,099
- Buffy? Buffy!
- What do you know?

332
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:25,354
- Should I get the principal?
- No, I'll deal with this. You're all dismissed.

333
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,899
Did you do it? Did you change him?

334
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:32,903
- For God's sake, calm down.
- Did you know this was gonna happen?

335
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,739
I didn't know... exactly.

336
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,118
I was told...

337
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,247
Oh, God.

338
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,627
I was sent here to watch you.
They told me to keep you and Angel apart.

339
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,713
- I didn't know what would happen.
- Jenny...

340
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,174
I'm sorry, Rupert.

341
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,052
Angel was supposed to pay
for what he did to my people.

342
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,930
And me? What was I supposed
to be paying for?

343
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:04,434
I didn't know what would happen until after.
I swear I would have told you.

344
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,855
So it was me. I did it.

345
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,023
I think so.

346
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,442
- I mean...
- I don't understand.

347
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,236
The curse.

348
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:20,492
If Angel achieved true happiness, even
just a moment of... he would lose his soul.

349
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,872
But how do you know
you were responsible for...

350
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,758
- If there's anything that...
- Curse him again.

351
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,972
No, I can't. Those magics
are long lost, even to my people.

352
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,559
- You did it once. It might not be too late.
- It can't be done.

353
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,271
I can't help you.

354
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,648
Then take me to someone who can.

355
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,735
I knew she would bring you.

356
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,529
I suppose you want answers.

357
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,949
Not really.

358
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:05,329
But thanks for the offer.

359
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,419
Left! Left! Left!

360
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,105
Wait here.
When you guys see that window open,...

361
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:36,360
.. get out the ladder, come up.
We'll pass you the package, OK?

362
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,487
Be careful.

363
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,630
The security here really is a joke.
I should report it.

364
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:02,094
- Who am I supposed to be again?
- A girl. Think you can handle it?

365
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,777
Halt! Identify yourself right the hell now!

366
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,866
Uh... Private Harris with the, uh... 33rd.

367
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,160
33rd are on manoeuvres.

368
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:30,831
Right. Uh... I'm on leave... from them.

369
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:34,459
You always spend your leave snoopin'
round the armoury? And who is she?

370
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,337
Hi. I'm not a soldier.

371
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,173
Right?

372
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:44,136
Look, I just wanna give her the tour.
You know what I'm sayin'.

373
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,973
- The tour.
- Well, the ladies like to see the big guns.

374
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,725
Gets them all hot and bothered.

375
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,437
- Can you cut me some slack?
- Why should I?

376
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:57,065
So I won't tell Colonel Newsome
that your boots ain't regulation,...

377
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,527
.. your post wasn't covered
and you hold your gun like a sissy.

378
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,616
- You got 20 minutes, Nimrod.
- I just need five.

379
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,203
Uh... forget I said that last part.

380
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:22,382
OK. What was that? And who are you?

381
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,510
At Halloween, I got turned into a soldier.

382
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:25,969
Yeah.

383
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:29,598
I still remember all of it.
I know procedure, ordnance, access codes.

384
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:34,937
I know the layout for this base and I'm pretty
sure I can put together an M-16 in 57 seconds.

385
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:39,399
I'm sort of impressed. But let's just
find the thing and get out of here.

386
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,735
OK.

387
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,866
So does looking at guns really make
girls wanna have sex? That's scary.

388
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,868
Yeah, I guess.

389
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,831
Well, does looking at guns
make you wanna have sex?

390
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,543
I'm 17. Looking at linoleum
makes me wanna have sex.

391
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,423
I wish they'd hurry.

392
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,178
So, do you guys steal weapons
from the army a lot?

393
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,849
Well, we don't have cable,
so we have to make our own fun.

394
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,268
I get you.

395
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,689
Do you wanna make out with me?

396
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,443
- What?
- Forget it. I'm sorry.

397
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,283
Well, do you?

398
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,829
Sometimes when I'm sittin' in class,...

399
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,791
.. not thinkin' about class,
cos that would never happen,...

400
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:42,796
.. I think about kissin' you and it's like
everything stops. It's like freeze-frame.

401
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,550
Willow kissage.

402
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,221
Oh, I'm not gonna kiss you.

403
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,265
What? But... freeze-frame.

404
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:58,937
Well, to the casual observer, it would appear
that you were trying to make Xander jealous.

405
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,316
Or even the score, or something.

406
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,235
And that's on the empty side.

407
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,948
See, in my fantasy, when I'm kissin' you...

408
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,035
.. you're kissin' me.

409
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,248
It's OK. I can wait.

410
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,461
We're up.

411
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,096
Oh, my God.

412
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,524
He's doing this deliberately, Buffy.

413
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:46,318
He's trying to make it harder for you.

414
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:50,697
He's only making it easier.
I know what I have to do.

415
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,950
What?

416
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,993
Kill him.

417
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,380
- I am ready.
- About time.

418
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,682
- Have fun.
- Too bad you can't come with, huh?

419
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,142
Be thinkin' of you.

420
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,520
I won't be in this chair forever.

421
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,694
- What happens if your girlfriend shows up?
- I'm gonna give her a kiss.

422
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,655
Don't you look spiffy!

423
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,658
Spiffy?

424
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,540
Happy birthday, Buffy.
I hope you like the colour.

425
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:46,587
We try the factory first, but they're on the
attack. We need to figure out where they'd go.

426
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,047
Agreed.

427
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:53,093
This is good.

428
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,429
Do you, uh...

429
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,848
Is there something I can do?

430
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,683
Get out.

431
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:04,062
I just wanna help.

432
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,816
She said "Get out. "

433
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:17,618
- Do you want me to show you how to use it?
- Yes, I do.

434
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,457
I knew it.

435
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,127
We haven't a bead on where they would go.

436
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,505
I don't know. Uh...

437
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,634
Somewhere crowded, I guess.
The judge needs bodies, right?

438
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,886
- The Bronze?
- It's closed tonight.

439
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:39,431
There's not a lot of choices here.
People don't line up to get massacred.

440
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,267
Uh, guys.

441
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,479
If I were gonna line up, I know where I'd go.

442
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,266
Lock the exits, boys.

443
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,399
It's all yours.

444
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:41,702
Everybody keep back. Damage control only.
Take out any lesser vamps. I'll take the smurf.

445
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,674
Oh, goody.

446
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,931
Who dares?

447
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:10,898
- I think I got his attention.
- You're a fool.

448
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,317
No weapon forged can stop me.

449
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,695
That was then.

450
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,780
This is now.

451
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,799
What's that do?

452
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,407
- Best present ever.
- I knew you'd like it.

453
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,868
- Do you think he's dead?
- We can't be sure.

454
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:09,331
- Pick up the pieces and keep them separate.
- Pieces? We get the pieces.

455
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,750
Our job sucks!

456
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:42,239
You know what the worst part was, huh?
Pretending that I loved you.

457
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:47,119
If I'd known how easily you'd give it up,
I wouldn't have even bothered.

458
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,247
It doesn't work any more. You're not Angel.

459
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,041
You'd like to think that. It doesn't matter.

460
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:57,379
The important thing is
you made me the man I am today.

461
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,856
Uh... arm.

462
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:29,578
You're not quittin' on me already, are ya?

463
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,747
Come on, Buffy.

464
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:34,708
You know you want it, huh?

465
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,987
You can't do it. You can't kill me.

466
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,085
Give me time.

467
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,988
It's not over. I suppose you know that.

468
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,702
He'll come after you... particularly.

469
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:54,079
His profile...

470
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:59,001
He's likely to strike out at
the things that made him the most human.

471
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:02,379
- You must be so disappointed in me.
- No.

472
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,884
- No. No, I'm not.
- This is all my fault.

473
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,513
I don't believe it is.

474
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:14,641
Do you want me to wag my finger
at you and say you acted rashly?

475
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:17,227
You did, and I can.

476
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,564
I know that you loved him.

477
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:25,694
And he... has proven
more than once that he loved you.

478
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,740
You couldn't have known
what would happen.

479
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:35,746
The coming months are gonna be hard...
I suspect, on all of us.

480
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:40,667
But if it's guilt you're looking for,
Buffy, I'm not your man.

481
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,756
All you will get from me is my support...

482
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:51,011
.. and my respect.

483
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:59,019
# Good night, my love

484
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:04,149
# My moment with you now is ending...

485
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:11,657
Did I miss anything?

486
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,078
Oh, just some singing
and some running round.

487
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,581
Oh. I'm sorry I didn't have time
to make you a real cake.

488
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,585
No. This is good.

489
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:26,255
But we're still going shopping on Saturday.

490
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,924
So what did you do for your birthday?

491
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:33,846
- Did you have fun?
- I got older.

492
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,767
You look the same to me.

493
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,697
Happy birthday.

494
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,825
I don't have to sing, do I?

495
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:58,620
No.

496
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,831
Well, go on. Make a wish.

497
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,173
I'll just let it burn.

498
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,394
# Good night, my love

499
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,232
# Remember that you're mine

500
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:32,738
# Sweetheart
