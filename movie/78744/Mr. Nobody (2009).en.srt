1
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,679
Like most living creatures,

2
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:35,271
the pigeon quickly associates
the pressing of a lever with reward.

3
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:40,392
But when a timer releases the seal
automatically every 20 seconds,

4
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,924
the pigeon wonders,

5
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:45,155
"What did I do
to deserve this?"

6
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:49,153
If it was flapping
its wings at the time,

7
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:52,482
it will continue to flap
convinced that its actions

8
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:55,722
have a decisive influence
on what happens.

9
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:59,536
We call this
"pigeon superstition."

10
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,866
MR. NOBODY

11
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:14,682
What did I do
to deserve this?

12
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:31,947
How's it been going
since the last time?

13
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,330
- Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.

14
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:45,923
I'm Dr. Feldheim.

15
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:50,553
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

16
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,643
Nemo Nobody.

17
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:55,947
That's an unusual name,
don't you think?

18
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:59,680
Sometimes,
people call me Mr. Craft.

19
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:00,857
Who?

20
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,976
C-R-A-F-T.

21
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:09,633
Can't Remember
A Fucking Thing.

22
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:18,716
What was the first question
I asked you?

23
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:24,294
- I don't know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?

24
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,896
I'm 34.

25
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:32,452
I was born in 1975.

26
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,395
Would you mind
looking at your hands?

27
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,900
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

28
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:44,225
There's a mirror
in front of you.

29
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,532
No. I..

30
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,730
What year is this?

31
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,913
2009.

32
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:58,127
I'm 34.

33
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:04,220
I was born
February 9th, 1975.

34
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:09,907
So I guess, it must be
your birthday.

35
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,068
I'm 34.

36
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:27,432
I'm 34!

37
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,920
I've got to wake up!

38
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:35,107
I've got to wake up!

39
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:57,418
Don't, Nemo.
Sun hurts my eyes.

40
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,445
Hey, buddy.

41
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:55,896
Good morning, my little angels.

42
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,551
- Time for school, okay?
- Hmm.

43
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,080
Come on.

44
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:04,019
Elise, I'm gonna
take the kids to school.

45
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,915
- Paul, keep it down.
- My name's not Paul.

46
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:32,396
Paul?

47
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:36,503
Daddy..

48
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:38,869
Daddy..

49
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:42,288
Daddy..

50
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:46,049
Paul, don't wake your father.

51
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,935
Elise.

52
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,691
It's me, Jean.

53
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,067
- Am I dead?
- Go back and play Paul.

54
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,678
- Who's Elise?
- I don't know anyone called Elise.

55
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:07,228
You're so tired, Nemo.
You need to rest.

56
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,024
I'll turn the television
on for you.

57
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,908
I'm going inside..

58
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:14,147
- The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?

59
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:17,744
The sun hurts my eyes.

60
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:33,268
Nemo, your friends are here.

61
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,647
Hello, Nemo.

62
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,151
How are you feeling today?

63
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:58,130
Do you know who I am?

64
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:04,834
We're all very worried about you, Nemo.

65
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,384
Everyone wants you be
back in the office soon.

66
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,549
Mrs. Nobody.

67
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:57,102
<i>This is Julian Marshall.</i>

68
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,283
<i>Live from New New York hospital,</i>

69
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:04,254
<i>where we're going to see the final episode
in our series, "The Last Mortals"</i>

70
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:10,818
<i>Mr. Nobody is 117 years old
and he has not been telemorized!</i>

71
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,832
<i>Nor does he have one of these
marvelous stem-cell compatible pigs.</i>

72
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,297
<i>Live on WWB,</i>

73
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:25,789
<i>Mr. Nobody will be the last man
on Earth to die of old-age.</i>

74
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:29,469
<i>- Mr. Nobody..
- The Last Mortal.</i>

75
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,992
<i>The last mortal.</i>

76
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:50,118
Now, Doctor,

77
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:53,398
no trace of his identity has been
found on the National Records.

78
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:56,242
Nothing about his past.

79
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:58,415
We do not know
who Mr. Nobody is.

80
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,762
Neither does he.

81
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:02,116
Our patient's memories
are confused,

82
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,583
<i>but it is not unusual
at his certain stage of illness..</i>

83
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:09,250
<i>for very old memories
to re-emerge in great detail.</i>

84
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,856
Let's try something new.

85
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:16,532
I'm thinking
of an old technique.

86
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,769
I can't promise anything.

87
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:22,249
Maybe snatches of memory
will come back.

88
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,560
Maybe nothing will happen.

89
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,742
Are you willing to try?

90
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:38,400
You are very relaxed.

91
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,881
You hear only my voice.

92
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:47,214
Your eyelids
are getting heavy.

93
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:51,596
Your arms and legs
are getting heavy.

94
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,261
I'm going
to count to three.

95
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:58,518
When I say three..

96
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,761
you will be asleep.

97
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:04,342
One.

98
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:08,243
Two.

99
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:14,354
Remember
the day you came here.

100
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:21,084
Three.

101
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,531
You're sleeping.

102
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,388
SLEEP..

103
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,979
Remember even further back.

104
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:13,208
When I say three..

105
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:14,749
One..

106
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,496
Two..

107
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:20,103
Three.

108
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,054
Remember.

109
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:31,832
I can remember
a long time ago..

110
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:33,715
Long before my birth.

111
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:42,548
I was whizzing with those
who were not yet born.

112
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,370
When we're not born yet,
we know everything.

113
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,490
Everything that's will happen.

114
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:23,674
When it's your time,

115
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,206
the angels of Oblivion
place a finger on your mouth.

116
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,486
Shh.

117
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,482
It leaves a mark
on the upper lip.

118
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:36,038
It means that
you have forgotten everything.

119
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,429
But the angels missed me.

120
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:52,257
Then you have to find
a daddy and a mummy.

121
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:54,299
It's not easy to choose.

122
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:57,676
Blond and blue eyed.
It's all I'm asking.

123
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:58,690
Andrew!

124
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,849
It would be nice to the little one
not to be all alone.

125
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:02,052
You stay here.

126
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,112
It's normal to think about babies
when you reach a certain age.

127
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:06,525
Well, for women at least.

128
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,317
It's the meaning of life..

129
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,098
Of life. I had not
finished yet, darling.

130
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,478
It's the meaning of life.

131
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,714
It's not
that we want a kid.

132
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:15,992
But we slept together.

133
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:19,115
- It's an important experience.
- It's an important experience, yeah.

134
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:22,695
I think it would help my husband
if we had a child.

135
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,566
We'd call him George.
Right, George?

136
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,069
We had a dog, but he died.

137
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:49,143
In the end, I chose them
because the lady smelled nice

138
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,434
and the man said..

139
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,672
Well, I can tell you
how we met.

140
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:57,605
It was meant to be.
Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?

141
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:59,106
Once upon a time,
there was a daddy and a mommy

142
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,264
named "The Daddy"
and "The Mommy".

143
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,029
They found a cute little baby

144
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:07,340
and called it
"The Cute Little Baby".

145
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,712
The little baby was born there.

146
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:12,452
He was born that day,
and not another.

147
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:16,337
His daddy and his mummy
live at number seven.

148
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,362
Everything you see exists.

149
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,194
We can see it.

150
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:26,830
I can see Mummy's eyes.
But I can't see my eyes.

151
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:33,070
The little baby can see his hands,
but he can not see himself.

152
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:36,320
So, does he really exist?

153
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:38,264
Do I really exist?

154
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,133
Boo.

155
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:45,345
Boo.

156
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:48,974
{y:i} Eenie meenie minie mo

157
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,347
{y:i} Catch a baby by the toe

158
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,697
{y:i} If he squeals let him go

159
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,287
{y:i} Eenie meenie minie mo

160
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:59,984
{y:i} My mother told me
to pick the very best one

161
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,752
{y:i} And you are it

162
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:16,236
The Mummy has a brush for her hair
and lipstick for her lips.

163
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:17,933
She smells good.

164
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:21,630
The Daddy has a watch
and hair in his arm.

165
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,176
The watch goes "tick-tock".

166
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:28,456
If the baby falls,
the mother claps her hands.

167
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,544
She says, "Bravo."

168
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,545
Bravo.

169
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:44,959
Why am I me,
and not someone else?

170
00:19:55,916 --> 00:20:00,360
<i>And so, high fresher fronts
moving in tomorrow.</i>

171
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:03,000
<i>It will bring clear skies
for the whole weekend.</i>

172
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,826
<i>So, get those barbecues out.</i>

173
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,055
Hello.

174
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:25,710
Why do we remember the past,
but not the future?

175
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:28,654
When you ask Mummy,
she says,

176
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:30,700
- "Stop asking why."
- Stop asking why.

177
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:33,088
- "It's complicated."
- It's complicated.

178
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:43,383
Yes.

179
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:55,787
It's okay,
I'm.. I'm a journalist.

180
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:02,436
The hospital won't allow interviews.
I just like to ask you a few questions.

181
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:07,858
A friend of mine's a nurse here.
She helped me get in.

182
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:10,444
What time is it?

183
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:12,928
14:12.

184
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:17,046
Where did you get that?

185
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:19,790
I borrowed it
from the University Museum.

186
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,038
But it still works.

187
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,304
I've got nothing
to say to you.

188
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:28,324
- I'm..
- I'm Mr. Nobody.

189
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:30,642
The man who doesn't exist.

190
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,809
Do you remember what the world was like
before quasi-immortality?

191
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:38,780
- What?
- Telemorization.

192
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,496
Endless renewal of cells.

193
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,175
What was it like
when humans were mortal?

194
00:21:47,157 --> 00:21:50,454
There were cars
that polluted.

195
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:56,364
We smoked cigarettes.
We ate meat.

196
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,311
We did everything we can do
in this dump and it was wonderful.

197
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:07,657
Most of the time,
nothing happened..

198
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:11,323
like a French movie.

199
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:17,254
And sexually?
Before sex became obsolete?

200
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:22,443
We screwed!

201
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,988
Everybody
was always screwing.

202
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:31,743
We fell in love.

203
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:35,625
We fell in love.

204
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:44,010
What time is it?

205
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:49,145
What was there
before the Big Bang?

206
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,440
Well, you see,

207
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,883
there was no before because
before the Big Bang,

208
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:55,993
Time did not exist

209
00:22:56,028 --> 00:23:00,638
Time is a result of
the expansion of Universe itself,

210
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:04,082
but what will happen when
the Universe has finished expanding..

211
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:05,650
and the movement
is reversed?

212
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,640
What will be
the nature of time?

213
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,642
If String Theory is correct,

214
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:13,447
the Universe possesses
nine spatial dimensions,

215
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:15,448
and one temporal dimension.

216
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,187
Now we can imagine that
in the beginning,

217
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:20,696
all the dimensions
were twisted together

218
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:23,051
and during the Big Bang,
three spatial dimensions,

219
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:25,856
the ones that we know as
height, width and depth,

220
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:30,220
and one temporal dimension,
what we know as time, were deployed.

221
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:34,222
The other six remained miniscule,
wound up together.

222
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:38,189
Now, if we live in a Universe
of wound dimensions,

223
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:40,897
how do we distinguish
between..

224
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:43,423
illusion and reality?

225
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:47,636
Time, as we know it, is
a dimension we experience

226
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:49,775
only in one direction.

227
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:53,517
But what if one of the additional
dimensions wasn't spatial,

228
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,076
but temporal?

229
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:59,447
If you mix the mashed potatoes
and sauce,

230
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:04,120
you can't separate them later.
It's forever.

231
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:06,851
The smoke comes out
of Daddy's cigarette,

232
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:09,205
but it never goes back in.

233
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:16,646
We cannot go back.

234
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,576
That's why
it's hard to choose.

235
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:25,533
You have to make
the right choice.

236
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:35,327
As long as you don't choose,
everything remains possible.

237
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:46,615
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Anna.

238
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:49,898
- Hi, Nemo.
- Hello, Elise.

239
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,162
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Jean.

240
00:24:55,365 --> 00:25:00,055
For as much as Anna and Nemo
have consented together in holy wedlock,

241
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,556
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company.

242
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:08,264
For as much as Elise and Nemo have
consented together in holy wedlock..

243
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,620
Jean and Nemo
have joined themselves..

244
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:17,048
I pronounce that they be
husband and wife together..

245
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:22,607
Those who God has joined together,
no one can separate..

246
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:47,217
Daddy says you can predict exactly
when Mars will be in the sky,

247
00:25:47,702 --> 00:25:49,558
even in 100 years.

248
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,292
But the funny thing is,

249
00:25:51,644 --> 00:25:53,769
that daddy does not know
what will happen to him

250
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,391
two minutes from now.

251
00:26:58,936 --> 00:26:59,936
Mama!

252
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:31,017
That's not possible, no
one knows the future.

253
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:32,901
That's I, I remember it.

254
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,997
You remember the past, not the future.

255
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:36,649
Believe me. I can.

256
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:40,709
Sometimes things happen and I'm feeling
that they have already happened before.

257
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:46,844
Well, that's deja vu.

258
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:50,177
It happens to everyone from time to time.

259
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:52,817
No! It's because of the
Angels of Oblivion!

260
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:55,247
They did not put their finger on me!

261
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,967
Come on!

262
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,360
Get it! Grab on!

263
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,687
One, two..

264
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:53,510
Should Mr. Nobody be allowed
to die a natural death?

265
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:58,579
Should his existence be artificially
prolonged? Make your vote now!

266
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:01,328
Press X for artificial prolongation,

267
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:05,111
press 0 to let nature run its course.

268
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:07,369
We'll be back after this!

269
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,225
You too can take a valley
vocation on Mars.

270
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:13,283
Book before the Union
and save 16,000 inits.

271
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:30,484
Okay, Anna, let's go.

272
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:48,311
Then, the Daddy and the Mummy
kissed all day long.

273
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:15,209
So, Nemo, have you
made up your mind?

274
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:21,459
Do you want to come with me?
Or do you want to stay with your father?

275
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:35,298
Nemo!

276
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,107
I'm sorry,
I-I don't understand.

277
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:54,175
Did you stay with your father
or go with your mother?

278
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:08,174
- Daddy, is it my fault?
- Of course not.

279
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:10,361
It's my fault.

280
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:23,302
I can give you a good deal
on this type of shoe lace.

281
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,654
A very good deal.

282
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,761
Remember.

283
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:08,844
Remember.

284
00:37:13,302 --> 00:37:14,480
Nemo..

285
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:16,070
Nemo.

286
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:21,909
It's time to wake up, darling.

287
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:40,828
And guess what?
You're going to be late for school.

288
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:56,388
Nemo, it's me.

289
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:02,470
I bet you haven't done
your homework.

290
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,238
Hurry up and finish.

291
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:07,366
I invited someone
for dinner.

292
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,623
I'm counting on you
to keep your mouth shut!

293
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,161
- How was the trip?
- Uh, it was good.

294
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:23,802
- Have you seen some nice apartments?
- I did. I've seen a couple of nice ones.

295
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:27,419
Nemo, don't stare
at people like that.

296
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:30,193
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

297
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:32,862
He has a gift for making people
uncomfortable.

298
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:34,039
It's nothing.

299
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:37,172
It will happen
on a Saturday..

300
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,601
You will be behind
the wheel of your car..

301
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,225
You are whistling..

302
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,076
You do not see
the crossroads..

303
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:54,573
All of a sudden,
a train will appear from your left.

304
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:56,924
And you will be crushed.

305
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,407
You're not funny.

306
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:13,938
Nemo thinks
he can predict the future.

307
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:19,017
I can. I predicted Dad's accident.

308
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:22,026
Yeah, I always wondered if you're not
the one who took off the handbrake.

309
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:26,026
No one can predict the future,
no one knows what's going to happen.

310
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:27,964
I do.

311
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:32,039
Well if you could, you'd know
you were going to get that.

312
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:34,823
I knew you'd say that.

313
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,508
Proud of yourself?

314
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:53,975
Why you systematically
ruin everything I..

315
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:57,198
Do you think I have a right to live too?

316
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:10,726
You could've stayed with your
father if you wanted to.

317
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,511
Everyone, please.

318
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:23,873
I would like to introduce you
a new student in our class.

319
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:25,490
Her name is Anna.

320
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:27,020
Please Anna, take a seat.

321
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:30,500
Alright,
let's turn to page 215.

322
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:32,296
It's last night's reading.

323
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:35,348
We're going to talk about
climate and vegetation zones

324
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:39,036
and the elements of weather
that are involved in each of both zones.

325
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:43,015
There are five elements that
make up weather as we know it.

326
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,427
Atmosphere pressure..

327
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:02,225
You're going to swim?

328
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,410
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I..

329
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:11,303
Come swim with us.
They're my friends, c'mon.

330
00:41:12,492 --> 00:41:13,669
They're idiots.

331
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:16,890
And I don't go
swimming with idiots.

332
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:21,861
Jerk.

333
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:37,097
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

334
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:51,205
Anna.

335
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:52,641
Nemo.

336
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:54,236
Yeah.

337
00:41:55,494 --> 00:41:56,789
How have you been?

338
00:41:57,822 --> 00:41:58,882
I'm fine.

339
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,268
How are you?

340
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:02,948
Yeah, good.

341
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:05,175
Are these your kids?

342
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:06,877
Yeah.

343
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:16,537
Well, I'll see you around.

344
00:42:18,126 --> 00:42:19,067
Yeah, uh..

345
00:42:19,634 --> 00:42:21,401
I'll see you around.

346
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:38,051
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

347
00:43:06,223 --> 00:43:07,400
You're going to swim?

348
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:09,799
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I..

349
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:17,379
I don't know how to swim.

350
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:18,671
Sorry?

351
00:43:20,303 --> 00:43:21,952
I don't know how to swim.

352
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:24,824
That's it.

353
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:28,014
Please don't tell anyone.

354
00:43:30,268 --> 00:43:31,564
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

355
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35,720
No, I've got my period.
I'm gonna stay here.

356
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:37,726
Nemo will keep me company.

357
00:43:37,727 --> 00:43:38,188
Okay.

358
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,809
Darling? I.. I want to
introduce you to someone.

359
00:44:12,993 --> 00:44:15,465
- You've already met Harry.
- Hey.

360
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:20,216
And this is his daughter, Anna.
Anna, this is Nemo.

361
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:32,808
Why don't you shake hands?

362
00:44:51,703 --> 00:44:52,997
How was work today?

363
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,588
Ugh, I can't believe them.

364
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,944
Soon as I wonder
how old they are.

365
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:24,811
They already slept together?

366
00:45:25,074 --> 00:45:26,369
I don't know.

367
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:28,741
I hope they use condoms.

368
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:31,920
I do not want to end up
with a little brother.

369
00:45:33,422 --> 00:45:35,071
I'd rather die.

370
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:36,686
Is you mom on the pill?

371
00:45:38,095 --> 00:45:39,272
I have no idea.

372
00:45:40,892 --> 00:45:43,247
We should slip it
into her morning coffee.

373
00:45:43,303 --> 00:45:45,892
It's like her hormones
have gone to her head.

374
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:54,058
Sometimes
I can see the future.

375
00:45:56,543 --> 00:46:00,311
It doesn't seem like it can be much fun
knowing what's going to happen.

376
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,134
You're still here.

377
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,593
Did I fall asleep?

378
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:33,624
Sometimes I don't sleep.

379
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:36,663
So I think..

380
00:46:39,052 --> 00:46:41,995
I think about how it was.

381
00:46:44,352 --> 00:46:47,060
It's all I have left.

382
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:53,967
What do you see
when you look at me?

383
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:58,516
A grumpy old man
who never answers questions?

384
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:00,753
Who mixes everything up?

385
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:06,799
Who is kept busy
by getting his meals?

386
00:47:08,523 --> 00:47:10,877
Now that's not me..

387
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,345
Me..

388
00:47:17,942 --> 00:47:20,061
I wear shorts.

389
00:47:22,223 --> 00:47:25,284
I'm nine years old.

390
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:30,367
I can run faster
than the train.

391
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:36,812
I can't feel
my aching back anymore.

392
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:40,660
I'm 15.

393
00:47:43,454 --> 00:47:45,572
I'm 15.

394
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:49,480
And I'm in love.

395
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:54,232
I'm in love.

396
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:17,944
Nemo?

397
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:20,618
Nemo?

398
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:25,202
Nemo?

399
00:49:31,812 --> 00:49:33,695
Isn't he sleeping
in the study?

400
00:49:34,177 --> 00:49:36,531
No, I just looked
and he isn't there.

401
00:49:37,188 --> 00:49:40,366
- Anna, have you seen your brother?
- He's not my brother.

402
00:49:51,013 --> 00:49:53,251
Oh, there you are.
Sleep alright?

403
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:20,556
- Who's that?
- It's me.

404
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:23,792
It's me, Dad..

405
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,150
Nemo.

406
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,182
Your son.

407
00:50:27,936 --> 00:50:29,702
Of course, son.

408
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:33,510
- Where were you?
- At the shop, Dad.

409
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:36,072
I always work at the shop
after school.

410
00:50:36,142 --> 00:50:40,617
You know, a boy your age
should get out more.

411
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:43,896
You can leave me alone, you know.
I-I can manage.

412
00:50:43,931 --> 00:50:45,544
It's no problem, Dad.

413
00:50:46,388 --> 00:50:47,919
I like being at home.

414
00:51:17,646 --> 00:51:20,119
There was a card
from your mother in the post.

415
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:25,584
- You have not read it.
- I know. I'll read it later.

416
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:27,579
Won't you go
and see her one day?

417
00:51:28,442 --> 00:51:30,796
I haven't seen her
in seven years.

418
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:33,793
If she ever wanted to see me,
she'd know where to find me.

419
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:39,494
I've got everything
I need, Dad.

420
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,611
Everything's fine.

421
00:52:16,181 --> 00:52:18,300
After three months,

422
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:20,816
and six days of travel..

423
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,908
the shuttle was heading..

424
00:52:27,747 --> 00:52:31,515
directly toward
the Cancer nebula..

425
00:52:33,095 --> 00:52:35,567
in line with Uranus..

426
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:39,166
and its five moons.

427
00:53:00,205 --> 00:53:03,266
It was finally aproaching
Mars and the Colonies.

428
00:53:08,736 --> 00:53:10,149
Onboard..

429
00:53:10,907 --> 00:53:14,792
the computer was monitoring
the passengers' artificial hibernation

430
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,327
Elise.

431
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,541
I'm not crazy.

432
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,733
Come on,
it's not that bad!

433
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,676
I didn't say anything mean.

434
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,403
Shall we go, Nemo?

435
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:24,171
- Excuse me?
- Shall we go? He's such a bore.

436
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:46,013
You'll drown.

437
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:55,748
- How do you know my name?
- We go to the same school.

438
00:55:56,608 --> 00:56:00,022
You never noticed me.
You never notice anyone.

439
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:07,945
D'you have a girlfriend?

440
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,839
What? Are you queer?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

441
00:56:13,865 --> 00:56:15,396
I don't know..

442
00:56:16,202 --> 00:56:17,732
I-I don't want one.

443
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,001
Tell me about yourself.

444
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,872
You used to piss your pants,
everyone knows you're weirdo.

445
00:56:30,282 --> 00:56:31,770
You're always alone..

446
00:56:35,613 --> 00:56:36,613
Talk.

447
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,705
Or say something.
Come on..

448
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:50,661
Gravity on Mars is 0.38.

449
00:56:53,608 --> 00:56:56,198
That's three times
less than on Earth.

450
00:56:58,051 --> 00:57:02,055
The ground is covered
with an iron oxide dust.

451
00:57:10,102 --> 00:57:11,162
You're incredible.

452
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:17,575
- Raise your hand and say "I swear."
- Why?

453
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:22,392
Promise me that if I die,
you'll spread my ashes on Mars.

454
00:57:23,382 --> 00:57:26,912
It's estimated that travel to Mars
would take six to eight months.

455
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:28,443
Say "I swear."

456
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:33,483
I swear.

457
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:40,733
We were neighbors
when we were little.

458
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:45,106
It's Elise.

459
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,073
Don't you remember?

460
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:49,266
Elise.

461
00:57:50,112 --> 00:57:52,210
I had a feeling I've
seen you or something.

462
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:54,102
Yeah, that's called deja vu.

463
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:57,159
- And the signal from the eyes
goes from the memory..

464
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,703
No, it's not it.

465
00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:01,674
Another life then?

466
00:58:03,038 --> 00:58:04,216
Anyway..

467
00:58:05,585 --> 00:58:07,234
I remembered you.

468
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:22,285
We shouldn't.

469
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,581
You don't know me
and I am not a good person.

470
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:27,487
Why do you say that?

471
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:52,387
- Elise, wait!
- I'll call you.

472
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:54,563
You don't have
my phone number.

473
00:58:57,277 --> 00:58:59,867
What happens
when we fall in love?

474
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,270
As a result
of certain stimuli,

475
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:08,497
the hypothalamus releases
a powerful discharges of endorphins..

476
00:59:08,532 --> 00:59:12,780
but why exactly that woman
or that man?

477
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,584
Is there a release of
odourless pheromones

478
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,787
that correspond to
our complimentary genetic signal?

479
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:22,342
Or is it physical feutures
that we recognize?

480
00:59:22,377 --> 00:59:24,462
A mother's eyes..

481
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:28,171
A smell that stimulates
a happy memory.

482
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:33,098
Is love..
part of a plan?

483
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:37,422
A vast war plan
between two modes of reproduction

484
00:59:37,482 --> 00:59:41,620
Bacteria and viruses
are asexual organisms.

485
00:59:41,655 --> 00:59:44,424
With each cell division,
each multiplication,

486
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:47,436
they mutate and perfect themselves
much more quickly than we do.

487
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:52,113
Against this, we respond
with the most fiercing weapon:

488
00:59:52,148 --> 00:59:53,290
Sex.

489
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:57,167
Two individuals,
by mixing their genes,

490
00:59:57,191 --> 01:00:02,739
shuffle the cards and create an individual
who resists viruses better.

491
01:00:02,774 --> 01:00:05,426
The more disimilar
he or she is.

492
01:00:05,461 --> 01:00:11,667
Now, are we unknowing participants in
a war between two modes of reproduction?

493
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,319
Okay everyone,
that's it for today.

494
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:21,615
How was it?

495
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:24,003
You want to know the truth?

496
01:00:24,004 --> 01:00:25,711
O'key. It was good. It was really good.

497
01:00:29,622 --> 01:00:31,859
- Hey, honey.
- I'm gonna be a little late.

498
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:33,469
That's okay. Don't worry.

499
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,888
- I love you.
- I love you more.

500
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:38,799
<i>- Me more.
- Me more.</i>

501
01:00:38,896 --> 01:00:41,015
- Okay
- Cheater.

502
01:00:41,779 --> 01:00:43,780
Alright, I'll see ya later.

503
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,803
I always liked fish.

504
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:50,434
I never thought that one day
they would like me too.

505
01:01:53,253 --> 01:01:55,019
You're very relaxed.

506
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:59,800
Your eyelids
are getting heavy.

507
01:02:00,977 --> 01:02:02,978
Remember.

508
01:02:04,419 --> 01:02:06,068
Remember..

509
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,866
Remember..

510
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,181
Nemo..

511
01:03:19,182 --> 01:03:19,562
Shit.

512
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:20,789
Anna..

513
01:03:23,527 --> 01:03:26,823
We've got errands to run.
We'll back in an hour.

514
01:03:29,683 --> 01:03:33,805
Anna, cover up!
You're gonna get a sunburn.

515
01:04:52,048 --> 01:04:53,461
I want you.

516
01:04:54,915 --> 01:04:56,328
I want you too.

517
01:04:58,751 --> 01:04:59,576
Forever.

518
01:05:03,017 --> 01:05:04,312
Forever.

519
01:05:05,187 --> 01:05:06,952
Whatever happens.

520
01:05:07,582 --> 01:05:09,584
There is no life without you.

521
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:12,299
No life without you.

522
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,194
You look like my son.

523
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,018
I am your son, Dad.

524
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,807
My son's taller than you.

525
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:00,533
Elise

526
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:07,057
Someone just came in.

527
01:07:08,918 --> 01:07:12,215
If I could at least
move my fingers.

528
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:14,847
Or my eyes.

529
01:07:16,528 --> 01:07:18,412
Do you think he can hear us?

530
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,034
Have you seen any reaction?

531
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:22,192
I don't know, but..

532
01:07:22,676 --> 01:07:24,442
I've got a feeling
that he can.

533
01:07:24,443 --> 01:07:25,707
Who's there?

534
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,136
What am I doing here?

535
01:07:27,661 --> 01:07:30,251
If you can hear me,
move your fingers.

536
01:07:30,305 --> 01:07:31,601
I've got to get out of here.

537
01:07:31,717 --> 01:07:34,190
Go back,
before the accident.

538
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,726
I believe one thing.

539
01:08:08,996 --> 01:08:14,175
I believe that we should always say
"I love you" to the people we love.

540
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:22,982
I love you.

541
01:08:30,826 --> 01:08:34,357
Nemo.. we shouldn't.

542
01:08:35,989 --> 01:08:37,283
I love Stefano.

543
01:08:38,921 --> 01:08:39,628
What?

544
01:08:40,629 --> 01:08:43,102
You saw him
at the party with me.

545
01:08:45,184 --> 01:08:46,833
He doesn't love me.

546
01:08:48,514 --> 01:08:49,103
And so..

547
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,495
I love him anyways.

548
01:08:51,258 --> 01:08:53,142
I can't help myself.

549
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,375
I'm in love with him.

550
01:08:58,174 --> 01:08:59,116
I'm sorry.

551
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:13,395
Dad, I'm getting married.

552
01:09:13,645 --> 01:09:14,469
Oh!

553
01:09:15,032 --> 01:09:16,799
And who is the lucky lady?

554
01:09:17,142 --> 01:09:18,201
No, it's not that.

555
01:09:19,777 --> 01:09:22,720
I'm gonna marry the first girl
who dances with me tonight.

556
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:02,305
Thanks, Nemo.

557
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:40,831
Nemo.

558
01:10:46,664 --> 01:10:50,784
On that day, I would make
a lot of foolish decisions.

559
01:10:52,075 --> 01:10:55,489
One, I will never
leave anything to chance again.

560
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:58,305
Two, I will marry the girl
on my motorcycle.

561
01:10:58,814 --> 01:11:00,698
Three, I'll be rich.

562
01:11:00,902 --> 01:11:02,668
Four, we'll have a house.

563
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:04,239
A big house!

564
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:06,536
Painted yellow,
with a garden,

565
01:11:06,571 --> 01:11:09,007
and two children,
Paul and Michael.

566
01:11:09,008 --> 01:11:12,581
Five, I'll have a convertible..
A red convertible.

567
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:15,053
And a swimming pool.
I'll learn to swim.

568
01:11:15,197 --> 01:11:19,199
Six, I will not stop
until I've succeeded.

569
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,655
Daddy?

570
01:11:43,889 --> 01:11:45,067
Daddy?

571
01:11:49,298 --> 01:11:51,300
Paul, don't wake your father.

572
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:53,257
Elise?

573
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:55,592
It's me, Jean.

574
01:11:58,108 --> 01:11:59,404
Who is Elise?

575
01:12:03,295 --> 01:12:05,178
I don't know
anyone called Elise.

576
01:12:05,882 --> 01:12:07,766
Go back and play Paul.

577
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:13,239
Nemo, do I matter to you?

578
01:12:17,014 --> 01:12:17,956
I just..

579
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:20,779
I just like
to ask you one question.

580
01:12:22,135 --> 01:12:24,137
Did you do it on purpose?

581
01:12:27,122 --> 01:12:29,830
I found this
on the bedside table.

582
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:35,212
There comes a time in life
when everything seems narrow.

583
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:39,921
Choices have been made
I can only continue on.

584
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,291
I know myself like
the back of my hand.

585
01:12:44,337 --> 01:12:47,044
I can predict my every reaction.

586
01:12:47,045 --> 01:12:48,651
Everything is predictable.

587
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:54,177
My life has been cast in cement
with airbags and seatbelts.

588
01:12:54,178 --> 01:12:56,090
I've controlled everything.

589
01:12:56,117 --> 01:13:00,709
I've done everything to reach
this point and now that I'm here,

590
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,080
I'm fucking bored.

591
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:08,643
The hardest thing is knowing
whether I'm still alive.

592
01:13:16,317 --> 01:13:18,553
It is my handwriting.

593
01:13:19,768 --> 01:13:21,769
I don't remember.

594
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:40,172
Jean?

595
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,766
What did you say?

596
01:13:49,236 --> 01:13:50,649
I had a weird dream.

597
01:14:10,934 --> 01:14:14,141
Well, it's important
for you to understand.

598
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:17,758
In life things don't always turn out..

599
01:14:18,332 --> 01:14:20,174
as we plan them.

600
01:14:20,897 --> 01:14:22,680
Harry and I thought..

601
01:14:25,197 --> 01:14:27,312
Life isn't what we all think it will be.

602
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:30,048
What are you talking about?

603
01:14:31,296 --> 01:14:32,475
I don't understand.

604
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:35,469
Anna knows already.

605
01:14:38,415 --> 01:14:41,006
Harry and I
are going to separate.

606
01:14:42,481 --> 01:14:43,540
What?

607
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:46,171
Why?

608
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:51,716
- You have no right!
- Please, you played your part!

609
01:14:51,845 --> 01:14:53,965
I don't know what is going on
between you two

610
01:14:53,976 --> 01:14:56,448
and I don't wanna know.
It's sick!

611
01:14:56,578 --> 01:14:59,216
You're brother and
sister, for God's sake.

612
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:01,877
We are not brother and sister!

613
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:09,782
You knew!

614
01:15:11,364 --> 01:15:13,011
And you didn't tell me.

615
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,104
Where are you going?

616
01:15:24,945 --> 01:15:26,359
To New York.

617
01:15:28,604 --> 01:15:30,840
In ten days.

618
01:15:32,378 --> 01:15:34,733
My father found a job there.

619
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:47,206
Wait for me
near the lighthouse..

620
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:49,935
every Sunday, okay?

621
01:15:51,686 --> 01:15:54,041
Until we see each other again.

622
01:15:54,146 --> 01:15:56,382
For life, okay?

623
01:16:00,026 --> 01:16:01,910
It's not over.

624
01:16:09,384 --> 01:16:13,034
You're the first and last person
I'll ever love.

625
01:16:14,676 --> 01:16:16,207
Ten days.

626
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:19,229
That makes..

627
01:16:20,936 --> 01:16:22,584
14 thousand..

628
01:16:23,492 --> 01:16:25,376
400 minutes.

629
01:16:29,429 --> 01:16:32,137
I wish everything
would stop right now.

630
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:36,792
Things would stay
this way forever.

631
01:16:39,677 --> 01:16:42,502
They say that
if you slow your breathing..

632
01:16:43,672 --> 01:16:45,438
time slows down.

633
01:16:47,499 --> 01:16:49,264
The Hindu say so.

634
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:34,669
I have to remember the smell
of every part of your body.

635
01:17:44,281 --> 01:17:46,402
We'll meet
near the lighthouse.

636
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:12,103
Anna, it's time to go.

637
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:24,017
I love you.

638
01:19:07,783 --> 01:19:10,726
Anna!

639
01:19:46,336 --> 01:19:47,160
Anna..

640
01:19:48,339 --> 01:19:49,633
Can you hear me?

641
01:20:12,206 --> 01:20:13,972
We must look to the future.

642
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:16,777
It will be good
to move house.

643
01:20:17,047 --> 01:20:18,342
Have a new life.

644
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:20,688
Will we have a pool?

645
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:23,968
You hate water.
You don't even swim.

646
01:20:24,643 --> 01:20:27,584
- You never know what you want.
- You know what I don't want?

647
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:30,527
So tell me, what is it
you don't want?

648
01:20:32,676 --> 01:20:34,677
I don't want to be like you.

649
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:38,675
You know nothing about me.

650
01:20:40,027 --> 01:20:41,911
I've always loved pools.

651
01:20:44,187 --> 01:20:45,953
When I'm older,
I'll have a pool.

652
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,033
Anna.

653
01:21:44,556 --> 01:21:45,262
Anna.

654
01:21:47,442 --> 01:21:51,327
I feel like I'll be seeing you
at every street corner.

655
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:15,487
Sometimes I tell myself..

656
01:22:16,176 --> 01:22:18,767
maybe you live
in the same town I do

657
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,846
and I don't know where.

658
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:24,358
Maybe you're here,
very close.

659
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,454
Nemo, do you hear my voice?

660
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:31,709
Anna!

661
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:36,228
After 90 days,
the onboard computer

662
01:22:36,263 --> 01:22:38,937
is still maintaining
the passengers' metabolism

663
01:22:38,972 --> 01:22:41,409
at the level
of a hibernating frog.

664
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,759
He'd always been fascinated
by the fact

665
01:23:09,848 --> 01:23:13,277
that certain frogs can spend
the winter completely frozen.

666
01:23:13,312 --> 01:23:15,632
And that
when spring comes comma,

667
01:23:15,633 --> 01:23:19,824
they defrost
and begin living again period.

668
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,494
The onboard computer displayed..

669
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:26,159
"End of hibernation".

670
01:23:40,329 --> 01:23:42,095
<i>Welcome to Mars.</i>

671
01:23:42,599 --> 01:23:47,309
<i>We hope you had a pleasant dream
and a refreshing re-awakening.</i>

672
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:52,003
<i>Please leave your sleep suits in
your suspended animation cubicles</i>

673
01:23:52,038 --> 01:23:55,417
<i>and make your way
through to the Arrivals lounge.</i>

674
01:23:57,064 --> 01:24:00,302
<i>You will be directed to
the rest and recoveration rooms</i>

675
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:04,893
<i>to prepare for your first excursion
to the red planet itself.</i>

676
01:24:08,266 --> 01:24:10,958
Probably the worst thing
about being on Mars

677
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:13,078
is that nothing
will happen there.

678
01:24:13,578 --> 01:24:15,934
Time will seem stole and empty.

679
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:19,951
That doesn't look
like there's much to do.

680
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:22,211
I hope I brought enough
we took.

681
01:24:50,114 --> 01:24:51,056
Day time.

682
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:53,950
It's day time.

683
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:56,731
The sun is out.

684
01:24:58,361 --> 01:25:01,187
It's warmer on the right
than on the left

685
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:09,417
She's different
from the one this morning.

686
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,313
Not the same perfume.

687
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,649
Her hands are soft.

688
01:25:19,927 --> 01:25:21,105
Elise.

689
01:25:23,756 --> 01:25:25,285
Is that Elise?

690
01:25:29,561 --> 01:25:31,799
We sh.. We shoudn't.

691
01:25:34,054 --> 01:25:36,173
- I love Stefano.
- Shh.

692
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,705
Don't say anything.

693
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:42,102
You're the one I love.

694
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:45,864
You can count on me for Mars.

695
01:25:47,312 --> 01:25:48,489
I promise.

696
01:26:26,408 --> 01:26:28,646
Do you wanna go
for a walk or something?

697
01:26:30,214 --> 01:26:32,333
I don't want anything.

698
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:34,358
Nothing.

699
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:42,287
- I'm so horrible.
- No, you're not.

700
01:26:42,495 --> 01:26:45,967
- You're not horrible.
- I can't stand this life anymore.

701
01:26:46,002 --> 01:26:48,580
Think about it, you've got
the most incredible kids.

702
01:26:48,615 --> 01:26:52,230
Stop trying to make me feel better.
I'm actually feeling guiltier.

703
01:26:56,034 --> 01:26:58,389
What's wrong with me?

704
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:03,082
What is wrong with me?

705
01:27:12,254 --> 01:27:13,313
How's Mom?

706
01:27:14,284 --> 01:27:16,875
She's just a little tired.
She's sleeping.

707
01:27:17,034 --> 01:27:21,509
- She's always tired.
- Yeah, she's always tired.

708
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,164
Is she depressed?

709
01:27:24,858 --> 01:27:26,507
Well, she has ups and downs.

710
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:28,409
I don't know about you,

711
01:27:28,436 --> 01:27:30,443
but next time Mom
has one of her meltdowns,

712
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:32,327
I'm gonna go
live somewhere else.

713
01:27:37,446 --> 01:27:41,449
So.. who has a joke?

714
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,585
Anybody?

715
01:27:45,582 --> 01:27:46,524
I do.

716
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:52,119
What's green, small
and goes up and down?

717
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:54,495
A pea in an elevator.

718
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:58,145
It's not funny.
Old people humor.

719
01:28:00,076 --> 01:28:01,253
Are you gonna be okay?

720
01:28:01,617 --> 01:28:05,385
Of course. Not 'cause Mom's
not okay that I'm not okay.

721
01:28:25,017 --> 01:28:26,901
I can't stand it anymore.

722
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:30,953
- That noise..
- I'll ask them to keep it down.

723
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,386
But it is Joyce's birthday.

724
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:39,306
What kind of mother am I?

725
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:43,718
I gotta get up.

726
01:29:07,488 --> 01:29:09,019
- Are you having a good time?
- Yeah.

727
01:29:09,045 --> 01:29:10,458
Can I tell you one thing?

728
01:29:10,469 --> 01:29:12,589
You're not allowed to be partying
and not have a good time.

729
01:29:12,672 --> 01:29:13,205
It doesn't work that way.

730
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,726
- I know..
- And you know what, Tess?

731
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:16,257
You look beautiful.

732
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:18,160
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful..

733
01:29:18,195 --> 01:29:19,926
But your friends aren't
dancing enough..

734
01:29:19,962 --> 01:29:22,788
And your mother has to
take care of the situation!

735
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:24,835
Dancing!

736
01:29:27,317 --> 01:29:28,494
You, over there!

737
01:29:42,907 --> 01:29:44,673
Oh, oh!
This makes me like..

738
01:29:46,175 --> 01:29:47,353
Like a dog!

739
01:29:57,651 --> 01:30:00,594
Now let's get ready.
Take one.. two.. three!

740
01:30:22,728 --> 01:30:24,846
It was a nice day.

741
01:30:27,377 --> 01:30:29,614
Nicest in a long time.

742
01:30:35,058 --> 01:30:36,942
Okey-dokey.

743
01:30:36,943 --> 01:30:38,386
- Ready?
- Bye, Dad.

744
01:30:39,428 --> 01:30:41,547
Bye. Bye.

745
01:30:41,548 --> 01:30:42,834
- Have fun.
- Bye, Dad.

746
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:45,012
Bye-bye!

747
01:32:05,592 --> 01:32:06,968
I'm leaving!

748
01:32:06,969 --> 01:32:09,111
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

749
01:32:36,727 --> 01:32:37,872
Everything will be OK.

750
01:32:39,232 --> 01:32:40,689
That will be all right. Comon.

751
01:32:52,089 --> 01:32:53,706
Do you love me?

752
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:57,854
I could not live without you.

753
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,099
There is no life without you.

754
01:36:15,907 --> 01:36:17,438
Go slowly.

755
01:36:20,613 --> 01:36:22,497
I have to get used to it.

756
01:36:26,609 --> 01:36:32,142
I talked to you so much when you
weren't there. It's so strange for me..

757
01:36:32,443 --> 01:36:34,444
to talk to you for real.

758
01:36:51,874 --> 01:36:53,875
I need some time, Nemo.

759
01:36:56,565 --> 01:36:58,684
When we were separated at 15,

760
01:36:58,856 --> 01:37:01,911
I said I would never love
anyone else.

761
01:37:01,946 --> 01:37:02,736
Ever.

762
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:06,050
I would never become attached.

763
01:37:06,631 --> 01:37:08,750
I'd never see
you put anywhere.

764
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:11,193
I'd have nothing for myself.

765
01:37:14,364 --> 01:37:18,132
I decided
I would pretend to be alive.

766
01:37:23,132 --> 01:37:25,368
And this is
what I've been waiting for.

767
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:28,049
All this time..

768
01:37:30,066 --> 01:37:35,129
Renouncing all possible lives,
for one only..

769
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,289
With you.

770
01:37:47,316 --> 01:37:49,073
But I'm not used to it anymore.

771
01:37:50,824 --> 01:37:54,647
You know.. love.. I mean.

772
01:37:58,519 --> 01:38:00,625
I'm afraid of losing you again,

773
01:38:01,243 --> 01:38:03,876
I'm afraid of having to
do without you again

774
01:38:04,302 --> 01:38:05,006
I..

775
01:38:05,856 --> 01:38:07,452
I'm terrified of that.

776
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,545
We need to take some time

777
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:18,382
And, when will I see you again?

778
01:38:25,862 --> 01:38:27,386
Call me at this number

779
01:38:31,162 --> 01:38:32,291
in two days

780
01:38:36,645 --> 01:38:38,315
I'll meet you at the lighthouse.

781
01:39:21,646 --> 01:39:24,588
You know why I lost Anna?

782
01:39:26,218 --> 01:39:28,689
Because two months earlier

783
01:39:28,986 --> 01:39:32,371
An unployed Brazilian boiled an egg

784
01:39:38,136 --> 01:39:42,180
The heat created a
micro-climate in the room

785
01:39:42,928 --> 01:39:45,436
slight differece of temperature.

786
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:52,379
And heavy rain, two months later
on the other side of the world

787
01:39:54,277 --> 01:39:59,504
that Brazilian boiled an egg
instead of being at work

788
01:39:59,912 --> 01:40:02,568
He would have lost his job
in a clothing factory

789
01:40:02,913 --> 01:40:04,624
because six months earlier

790
01:40:04,995 --> 01:40:07,124
I would have compared
the prices of jeans

791
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:09,409
and I will have bought
the cheaper pair.

792
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,664
As the Chinese proverb says

793
01:40:12,147 --> 01:40:14,885
"A single snowflake
can bend the leaf of the bamboo."

794
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:19,731
Jeans production will have
moved to other countries.

795
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,855
I lost every trace of Anna.

796
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:36,232
I waited for her..

797
01:40:37,694 --> 01:40:38,837
every day.

798
01:42:09,763 --> 01:42:10,330
Anna.

799
01:42:15,191 --> 01:42:16,272
Nemo.

800
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:27,515
It's back.

801
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:28,966
The fear is back.

802
01:42:29,001 --> 01:42:31,493
I'm sick of pills!

803
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:34,725
I'm sick of doctors. It's pointless.

804
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:38,106
I'll do something. I
can't stand it any more.

805
01:42:38,107 --> 01:42:39,879
I'm afraid.

806
01:42:40,219 --> 01:42:42,143
I don't know what to do..

807
01:42:46,456 --> 01:42:48,123
I often have this dream.

808
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,760
It's a prehistoric time.

809
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:54,065
I can hear you screaming..

810
01:43:06,229 --> 01:43:07,658
I chased the bear.

811
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:10,672
And you're not afraid anymore.

812
01:43:11,383 --> 01:43:12,990
But when I wake up..

813
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:16,746
When I wake up

814
01:43:17,287 --> 01:43:18,686
there's no bear

815
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:22,178
but you're still afraid.

816
01:43:22,674 --> 01:43:24,641
I'm not a bear hunter

817
01:43:25,596 --> 01:43:28,807
I'm an executive of a plant that
manufactures photocopy machines

818
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:30,839
who just quit his job.

819
01:43:32,564 --> 01:43:33,721
I don't dare to move.

820
01:43:35,574 --> 01:43:36,483
I don't live

821
01:43:38,249 --> 01:43:40,153
All of I do is a disaster

822
01:43:43,006 --> 01:43:45,716
I would so love to be able
to chase the bear away..

823
01:43:46,712 --> 01:43:48,734
and for you not to be afraid anymore.

824
01:43:52,808 --> 01:43:55,525
To what extent are our fears innate?

825
01:43:57,223 --> 01:43:59,390
When we hatch goose eggs
in an incubator,

826
01:43:59,892 --> 01:44:04,866
and then, above the baby birds
pass a form simulating a goose in flight

827
01:44:05,686 --> 01:44:08,104
the birds strech
their necks and call out

828
01:44:08,551 --> 01:44:10,675
But if we invert the direction
of the silhouette,

829
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:13,928
it conjures the shape
of a falcon.

830
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,762
The response of the baby birds
is immediate.

831
01:44:17,332 --> 01:44:21,068
They will crouch and fear, though
they've never before seen a falcon.

832
01:44:21,385 --> 01:44:23,509
Without any instruction,

833
01:44:24,332 --> 01:44:27,357
an innate fear
helps them to survive.

834
01:44:28,927 --> 01:44:29,978
But in humans..

835
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:33,138
to what ancient dangers..

836
01:44:33,824 --> 01:44:36,109
might our innate fears correspond?

837
01:45:14,826 --> 01:45:18,307
NEMO.. TURN AROUND..

838
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:31,208
Hey.

839
01:45:31,791 --> 01:45:32,265
Hey!

840
01:45:33,543 --> 01:45:34,476
Excuse me!

841
01:46:19,678 --> 01:46:21,162
Remember..

842
01:46:22,785 --> 01:46:24,159
Remember!

843
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:39,926
Honey, it's me.

844
01:48:57,198 --> 01:48:59,401
Did Elise die or didn't she?

845
01:49:00,529 --> 01:49:01,576
I don't get it.

846
01:49:02,628 --> 01:49:04,946
You can't have had children
and not have had them.

847
01:49:14,744 --> 01:49:15,713
Hi, Dad.

848
01:49:18,023 --> 01:49:18,405
Hi.

849
01:49:19,883 --> 01:49:20,813
Hey.

850
01:49:22,637 --> 01:49:24,260
I'll be in a minute, guys.

851
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:50,700
- You're not hungry?
- I don't want anything.

852
01:49:51,355 --> 01:49:52,510
Nothing.

853
01:49:56,537 --> 01:49:57,745
What are you doing today?

854
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:02,518
I was thinking about taking
the opportunity to wash the car.

855
01:50:08,493 --> 01:50:09,913
What's the deal
with that car?

856
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,507
What do you mean?

857
01:50:14,699 --> 01:50:18,179
Why do you such good care of that car
while you leave me here all alone?

858
01:50:20,702 --> 01:50:22,131
What's the problem of the car?

859
01:51:11,304 --> 01:51:13,665
There's no more problem
with the car.

860
01:51:28,137 --> 01:51:29,177
What's wrong?

861
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,640
Why are you looking at me
like that?

862
01:51:32,786 --> 01:51:34,815
Why are you looking at me
like that?

863
01:51:37,058 --> 01:51:38,043
Nemo.

864
01:51:39,815 --> 01:51:41,951
Do I take sugar in my cofee?

865
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:47,045
Can you please answer me?

866
01:51:47,473 --> 01:51:48,473
Nemo.

867
01:51:52,657 --> 01:51:56,469
You don't know me, Nemo.
You've never really looked at me.

868
01:52:03,335 --> 01:52:06,046
You've always been elsewhere.

869
01:52:07,643 --> 01:52:10,870
Do you realize how much
you've hurt me?

870
01:52:19,398 --> 01:52:24,388
I got a call from the lawer. He
just says you just put everything

871
01:52:24,389 --> 01:52:26,398
you own on my name.

872
01:52:27,561 --> 01:52:29,253
Why, Nemo?

873
01:52:30,648 --> 01:52:32,574
What you're up to?

874
01:52:50,737 --> 01:52:52,865
Are you angling for success?

875
01:52:52,866 --> 01:52:54,733
Then you need a
butterfly fishing rod.

876
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:57,751
For tension and strength is..

877
01:52:57,752 --> 01:53:00,863
Buy one today, available now.

878
01:53:07,962 --> 01:53:08,962
Jean.

879
01:53:09,966 --> 01:53:12,030
A'm after buy a fishing rod.

880
01:53:59,911 --> 01:54:01,238
Mr. Jones.

881
01:54:03,173 --> 01:54:05,566
- Yes.
- We already have your luggage.

882
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:07,495
Please, follow me.

883
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:10,127
I'll take you to the hotel
where you can rest for a while.

884
01:54:10,162 --> 01:54:12,222
The appointment is at 3 PM.

885
01:54:38,797 --> 01:54:40,163
Daniel.

886
01:54:40,977 --> 01:54:42,824
Daniel Jones.

887
01:54:42,859 --> 01:54:45,245
Daniel Jones.

888
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:50,066
Is your name Daniel Jones?

889
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:54,460
Of course not!

890
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,777
Daniel Jones..

891
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:06,118
Hallo?

892
01:55:06,963 --> 01:55:07,963
Daniel?

893
01:55:08,899 --> 01:55:09,899
Yes.

894
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:12,268
Are you insane?

895
01:55:12,269 --> 01:55:14,925
I told you not to go. They are furious!

896
01:55:14,926 --> 01:55:17,332
They know it's you. Don't stay there!

897
01:55:50,837 --> 01:55:52,572
This is weird.

898
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:55,396
His shoes are different sizes.

899
01:56:06,753 --> 01:56:08,104
Maybe he shrunk.

900
01:56:08,139 --> 01:56:10,601
Times when you get older,
you shrink.

901
01:56:10,636 --> 01:56:12,294
No one shrinks,
that's rubbish.

902
01:56:12,701 --> 01:56:14,371
You got the wrong plug, that's all.

903
01:56:15,273 --> 01:56:17,975
Astronauts shrink two inches
when they come back to Earth.

904
01:56:18,533 --> 01:56:21,834
- Because of gravity or something.
- You think this fellow is an astronaut?

905
01:56:52,341 --> 01:56:55,102
The ground doesn't vibrate
in the same way.

906
01:56:57,649 --> 01:56:59,144
It's a different perfume.

907
01:57:01,143 --> 01:57:03,199
How old might she be?

908
01:57:03,691 --> 01:57:05,124
Twenty five?

909
01:57:07,527 --> 01:57:10,400
There are other people too.

910
01:57:19,327 --> 01:57:21,807
Let's begin again.

911
01:57:22,333 --> 01:57:24,030
Fingers on the keyboard.

912
01:57:25,994 --> 01:57:29,179
Left hand: A, S, D, F.

913
01:57:30,847 --> 01:57:33,924
Right hand: H, J, K, L.

914
01:58:51,023 --> 01:58:54,493
- What's wrong?
- I was dreaming about Stefano.

915
01:58:57,842 --> 01:58:59,653
He doesn't give a damn
about me.

916
01:59:01,411 --> 01:59:02,411
Stefano?

917
01:59:09,159 --> 01:59:10,209
I love him.

918
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:15,191
I can't see any other explanation
for being in this state.

919
01:59:17,916 --> 01:59:19,381
That's the only thing
it can be.

920
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:22,518
I love him.

921
01:59:25,296 --> 01:59:26,574
I know I'm crazy.

922
01:59:29,244 --> 01:59:32,193
Every morning when I wake up,
I open my eyes and I see your face

923
01:59:32,584 --> 01:59:34,185
and I start crying.

924
01:59:37,412 --> 01:59:40,950
I realize that with you,
my life is passing me by.

925
01:59:45,249 --> 01:59:48,297
How can you stay so calm?

926
01:59:48,298 --> 01:59:51,010
How can you bear that?

927
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:52,891
You're not human.

928
01:59:52,892 --> 01:59:54,469
I don't know what to do.

929
01:59:56,244 --> 01:59:58,076
It's not my fault, right?

930
01:59:58,465 --> 02:00:00,429
You're not gonna leave me,
are you?

931
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:02,967
No, I couldn't live without you.

932
02:00:05,874 --> 02:00:07,370
I've hurt everybody.

933
02:00:08,582 --> 02:00:10,129
I've hurt you.

934
02:00:11,410 --> 02:00:12,950
The children..

935
02:00:14,407 --> 02:00:17,418
- I just can't go on.
- Together we can do it.

936
02:00:17,791 --> 02:00:20,500
If I stay here, you're all gonna
end up drowning with me.

937
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,341
We'll learn to swim.

938
02:00:24,489 --> 02:00:25,552
I love you.

939
02:00:27,572 --> 02:00:28,680
I love you.

940
02:00:31,552 --> 02:00:33,100
I love you.

941
02:00:53,382 --> 02:00:54,581
She left me.

942
02:00:59,653 --> 02:01:02,080
You know what they say..

943
02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:05,975
Everything works out
in the end,

944
02:01:07,932 --> 02:01:09,116
even badly.

945
02:01:38,509 --> 02:01:39,128
Hello?

946
02:01:50,290 --> 02:01:52,694
Not too much
at the top, thanks.

947
02:02:05,949 --> 02:02:08,116
- How much should that be?
- $20, please.

948
02:02:09,463 --> 02:02:10,940
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

949
02:02:23,987 --> 02:02:26,798
- $20 please, sir.
- Here you are.

950
02:02:27,055 --> 02:02:28,285
Thank you. Bye, sir.

951
02:02:28,619 --> 02:02:31,354
Bye, and have
a nice afternoon.

952
02:02:55,783 --> 02:02:59,081
Why does cigarette smoke
never go back into the cigarette?

953
02:02:59,818 --> 02:03:02,118
Why do molecules spread
away from each other?

954
02:03:02,678 --> 02:03:05,026
Why does a spilled drop
of ink never reform?

955
02:03:05,792 --> 02:03:09,851
Because the Universe
moves towards a state of dissipation.

956
02:03:10,436 --> 02:03:12,131
That is the principle of entropy..

957
02:03:12,426 --> 02:03:14,020
The tendency of the Universe

958
02:03:14,503 --> 02:03:17,559
to evolve toward a state
of increasing disorder.

959
02:03:18,198 --> 02:03:19,546
The principle of entropy

960
02:03:19,685 --> 02:03:22,369
is related
to the arrow of time..

961
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:25,275
A result of the expansion
of the Universe.

962
02:03:25,549 --> 02:03:27,623
But what will happen
when gravitational forces

963
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:30,238
counter-balance
the forces of expansion?

964
02:03:30,968 --> 02:03:33,566
Or if the energy of the quantum void
proves too weak?

965
02:03:34,325 --> 02:03:37,947
At that moment, the universe
might enter its phase of contraction.

966
02:03:38,598 --> 02:03:39,824
The Big Crunch.

967
02:03:44,095 --> 02:03:45,593
So what will become of time?

968
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:50,685
Will it reverse?

969
02:03:57,849 --> 02:03:59,561
No one knows the answer.

970
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:05,880
Where is Peter?

971
02:04:05,881 --> 02:04:10,224
He left an hour ago. I'm replacing
him. I've selected take 3 and take 4.

972
02:04:10,672 --> 02:04:13,872
I prefer that Peter does it. I don't mean
to say you're not good enough.

973
02:04:13,873 --> 02:04:14,873
But..

974
02:04:15,499 --> 02:04:17,922
Drop it. In live you get one take.

975
02:04:17,923 --> 02:04:20,454
If it's bad, you just deal with it.

976
02:04:49,410 --> 02:04:50,977
You know him?

977
02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:53,948
We work together.

978
02:04:55,456 --> 02:04:58,931
If I should die, and you shoul live,

979
02:05:31,826 --> 02:05:33,357
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

980
02:05:33,358 --> 02:05:35,630
My sincerest condolences.

981
02:05:35,786 --> 02:05:37,727
Peter was a colleague.

982
02:05:38,138 --> 02:05:39,187
Of course.

983
02:05:39,222 --> 02:05:42,161
I've seen your show.
Thank you for coming.

984
02:06:15,396 --> 02:06:17,330
<i>Please take
this oportunity to take</i>

985
02:06:17,495 --> 02:06:20,115
<i>one last close look
at the planet's surface.</i>

986
02:06:20,618 --> 02:06:22,801
<i>From our observation dome.</i>

987
02:06:23,037 --> 02:06:27,520
<i>Your elevator will arrive shortly
in the Mars transit station.</i>

988
02:06:33,777 --> 02:06:36,176
What are we doing
with all those bikes?

989
02:06:37,154 --> 02:06:39,958
They're for export.
Labor is much cheaper here.

990
02:06:40,404 --> 02:06:42,918
China has become
way too expensive.

991
02:06:44,887 --> 02:06:47,270
<i>Please proceed
to the preparation area</i>

992
02:06:48,003 --> 02:06:51,301
<i>where you will be reissued
to your sleep suits.</i>

993
02:06:51,766 --> 02:06:55,069
<i>You will also receive your..</i>

994
02:06:55,547 --> 02:06:56,205
Hi.

995
02:06:57,439 --> 02:06:58,456
I'm Nemo.

996
02:06:59,554 --> 02:07:00,272
Anna..

997
02:07:01,348 --> 02:07:02,516
Nice to meet you.

998
02:07:07,351 --> 02:07:08,695
What brings you to Mars?

999
02:07:09,628 --> 02:07:14,126
I'm measuring the distance between
Mars and Earth at it's greatest.

1000
02:07:14,701 --> 02:07:16,921
I study time. You know..

1001
02:07:17,475 --> 02:07:20,856
Thing that makes it so that
everything doesn't happen at once.

1002
02:07:24,534 --> 02:07:25,290
And?

1003
02:07:25,459 --> 02:07:27,759
The Big Crunch
will happen in 2092

1004
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:32,688
and people who can't hang
on that long will get a free run.

1005
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:34,997
And you?

1006
02:07:35,547 --> 02:07:37,509
I'm just
keeping an old promise.

1007
02:07:43,426 --> 02:07:44,426
Hi.

1008
02:07:45,195 --> 02:07:46,195
Hi.

1009
02:07:47,689 --> 02:07:50,489
We ah.. met at your husband's funeral.

1010
02:07:51,372 --> 02:07:52,372
Right.

1011
02:07:52,992 --> 02:07:55,741
I had the strangest feeling when
I saw you that we have met before.

1012
02:07:56,876 --> 02:07:59,027
It's called de javu.

1013
02:07:59,028 --> 02:08:00,595
That's not it.

1014
02:08:01,441 --> 02:08:03,192
It's as if..

1015
02:08:03,193 --> 02:08:05,447
all of this was in real.

1016
02:08:07,235 --> 02:08:11,115
I'm sorry you must think
that I'm completely crazy.

1017
02:08:12,184 --> 02:08:14,784
I'm not trying to flirt with you.

1018
02:08:14,785 --> 02:08:16,408
I am widower myself.

1019
02:08:16,409 --> 02:08:18,808
I.. I'm sorry. I have to go.

1020
02:08:18,809 --> 02:08:20,556
May be some other time.

1021
02:08:26,059 --> 02:08:27,059
Nemo?

1022
02:08:28,403 --> 02:08:31,363
I heard you were dead.
That you drowned.

1023
02:08:31,364 --> 02:08:32,801
Drowned?

1024
02:09:45,959 --> 02:09:49,132
<i>Alert! Alert!
Meteors approaching.</i>

1025
02:09:50,171 --> 02:09:51,175
<i>Don't panic.</i>

1026
02:09:52,862 --> 02:09:54,817
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

1027
02:10:13,381 --> 02:10:14,648
I wanna wake up.

1028
02:10:16,537 --> 02:10:17,958
I wanna wake up!

1029
02:10:18,597 --> 02:10:20,227
I wanna wake up!

1030
02:10:21,798 --> 02:10:24,657
GAME OVER.

1031
02:10:24,692 --> 02:10:26,009
Are you alright?

1032
02:10:28,045 --> 02:10:29,350
Are you alright?

1033
02:10:31,049 --> 02:10:33,935
When I say three,
you'll be awake.

1034
02:10:35,035 --> 02:10:36,047
One..

1035
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:42,166
Two..

1036
02:10:48,379 --> 02:10:49,049
Three.

1037
02:11:03,032 --> 02:11:05,213
WAKE UP..

1038
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:38,229
- Mother.
- Do I know you?

1039
02:11:39,216 --> 02:11:40,996
- It's me!
- What do you want?

1040
02:11:41,259 --> 02:11:43,029
- Henry!
- It's me. Your son, Nemo.

1041
02:11:44,118 --> 02:11:45,722
My son's just here.

1042
02:11:47,753 --> 02:11:51,485
I don't know you. You're mad.
Now go away or I'll call the police.

1043
02:11:52,604 --> 02:11:53,055
Mother.

1044
02:11:53,479 --> 02:11:54,511
Mother.

1045
02:12:11,163 --> 02:12:12,786
What do you see?

1046
02:12:12,787 --> 02:12:14,936
He askes me what I see.

1047
02:12:19,268 --> 02:12:21,579
I say, it's an ink stain.

1048
02:12:22,511 --> 02:12:23,498
He says:

1049
02:12:23,499 --> 02:12:25,667
You have to say more.

1050
02:12:25,837 --> 02:12:28,976
I say, it's an ink stain
on a sheet of paper.

1051
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:31,350
No.

1052
02:12:32,314 --> 02:12:36,105
You have to say, what
goes through your mind.

1053
02:12:40,637 --> 02:12:42,884
It makes me think of an inkwell.

1054
02:12:42,935 --> 02:12:45,488
So he says: "O'key.."

1055
02:12:46,567 --> 02:12:48,187
That's fine".

1057
02:13:02,466 --> 02:13:05,217
You have until tomorrow to vote.

1058
02:13:05,691 --> 02:13:06,691
Vote!

1059
02:13:06,692 --> 02:13:08,745
And win a vacation on the Moon.

For the whole family.

1061
02:13:10,968 --> 02:13:12,896
Win a trip to the Moon!

1062
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:16,156
Take a swing at a fabulous golf vacation.

1063
02:13:29,198 --> 02:13:32,128
Have they announced
the results of the voting?

1064
02:13:33,157 --> 02:13:34,574
I'm sorry.

1065
02:13:34,575 --> 02:13:37,292
At my age.

1066
02:13:37,293 --> 02:13:41,080
The candles cost more than a cake.

1067
02:13:45,187 --> 02:13:47,638
I'm not afraid of dying.

1068
02:13:47,942 --> 02:13:51,001
I'm afraid I have'nt been alive enough!

1069
02:13:54,403 --> 02:13:58,645
It should be written on every
schoolroom blackboard.

1070
02:14:00,432 --> 02:14:03,175
Life is a playground.

1071
02:14:04,742 --> 02:14:06,662
Or nothing.

02:14:13,905 --> 02:14:15,541
NOW

1075
02:14:18,012 --> 02:14:21,224
Nemo. Leave. NOW

1076
02:14:28,292 --> 02:14:29,292
Nemo!

1077
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:49,830
NEMO, READ THE NEWS.

1078
02:15:00,578 --> 02:15:02,318
Tragic car accident
on a country road

1079
02:15:04,187 --> 02:15:06,327
Nemo turn to page 5

1080
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:09,516
Nemo look at the
end of the street

1081
02:15:12,450 --> 02:15:15,672
NEMO CALL
123 581 1321

1082
02:15:24,317 --> 02:15:27,260
<i>- Hello, who is this?
- Hello, who is this?</i>

1083
02:15:27,959 --> 02:15:29,137
<i>Who is this?</i>

1084
02:15:30,234 --> 02:15:31,700
I was told to call this number.

1085
02:15:32,203 --> 02:15:33,985
My name is Nemo Nobody.

1086
02:15:35,967 --> 02:15:37,519
Is this some kind
of a joke?

1087
02:15:38,084 --> 02:15:39,916
No. No, I..

1088
02:15:44,774 --> 02:15:46,038
<i>- Operator?
- Yes?</i>

1089
02:15:46,136 --> 02:15:50,031
I'd like the address to
123 581 1321.

1090
02:15:51,028 --> 02:15:52,270
<i>One moment please.</i>

<i>12358 Alleway Street.</i>

1092
02:16:24,662 --> 02:16:26,335
<i>Hello, Nemo.</i>

1093
02:16:26,882 --> 02:16:28,933
<i>I'm glad you found me.</i>

1094
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:32,548
<i>All of this must seem
very complicated to you,</i>

1095
02:16:32,603 --> 02:16:35,096
<i>but it's simpler than you think.</i>

1096
02:16:35,669 --> 02:16:38,003
<i>Careful with the chair.
It is damaged.</i>

1097
02:16:44,676 --> 02:16:47,893
<i>- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.</i>

1098
02:16:50,047 --> 02:16:52,123
<i>I should have
warned you earlier but..</i>

1099
02:16:52,362 --> 02:16:54,972
<i>I couldn't
because of the transcript.</i>

1100
02:16:55,197 --> 02:16:56,196
The transcript?

1101
02:16:56,812 --> 02:17:00,044
<i>The text of our conversation!</i>

1102
02:17:02,369 --> 02:17:05,267
<i>- You can you hear me!
- What you are living now..</i>

1103
02:17:06,124 --> 02:17:07,601
<i>is the past.</i>

1104
02:17:08,727 --> 02:17:10,484
<i>At least, for me.</i>

1105
02:17:12,441 --> 02:17:13,844
<i>I am you..</i>

1106
02:17:14,805 --> 02:17:17,330
<i>70 years older.</i>

1107
02:17:19,001 --> 02:17:23,093
<i>Everything you say, I said
myself when I was young.</i>

1108
02:17:23,306 --> 02:17:26,958
<i>I only had to transcribe
our conversation.</i>

1109
02:17:27,705 --> 02:17:30,012
<i>It's all written right here.</i>

1110
02:17:30,071 --> 02:17:31,578
<i>- I can't..
- Believe it?</i>

1111
02:17:33,846 --> 02:17:35,229
<i>For me..</i>

1112
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:38,275
<i>time is inverted.</i>

1113
02:17:38,991 --> 02:17:41,551
<i>I start at the end of the story</i>

1114
02:17:41,552 --> 02:17:43,527
<i>and go toward the beginning.</i>

1115
02:17:44,433 --> 02:17:46,031
I don't understand.

1116
02:17:46,066 --> 02:17:47,666
<i>In this life here,</i>

1117
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,555
you don't exist.

<i>I don't know why..</i>

1119
02:17:52,791 --> 02:17:55,017
<i>Only the Architect knows.</i>

1120
02:17:56,655 --> 02:17:57,647
The Architect?

1121
02:17:58,802 --> 02:18:00,149
<i>The child..</i>

1122
02:18:01,173 --> 02:18:03,937
<i>The one running
after the train.</i>

1123
02:18:05,674 --> 02:18:08,394
<i>Maybe your parents
never met.</i>

1124
02:18:12,662 --> 02:18:17,514
<i>Maybe your father died
in a sledging accident.</i>

1125
02:18:19,224 --> 02:18:21,498
<i>Maybe you were one
of the vast majority</i>

1126
02:18:21,556 --> 02:18:26,281
<i>of those whose genetic code did not
reach its final destination.</i>

1127
02:18:29,695 --> 02:18:31,251
<i>Maybe when she died..</i>

1128
02:18:32,204 --> 02:18:33,881
<i>A prehistoric woman..</i>

1129
02:18:34,129 --> 02:18:38,121
<i>She rolled off the line of heritance
to which you belong.</i>

1130
02:18:39,486 --> 02:18:41,019
<i>So for this world..</i>

1131
02:18:44,012 --> 02:18:46,280
<i>You don't exist.</i>

1132
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:50,733
<i>If the Anna's calculations are correct,</i>

1133
02:18:51,446 --> 02:18:58,055
<i>you need to stay alive

I'm sorry, I don't know how long
we haven't been recording.

1136
02:19:36,872 --> 02:19:39,262
I have to submit my story
by tomorrow morning.

1137
02:19:41,702 --> 02:19:43,972
Everything that you say
is contradictory.

1138
02:19:45,483 --> 02:19:49,045
You can't have been in one place
and another at the same time.

1139
02:19:49,894 --> 02:19:54,084
You mean to say
we have to make choices?

1140
02:19:54,561 --> 02:19:56,128
Of all those lives,
which one..

1141
02:19:57,581 --> 02:19:58,957
Which one is the right one?

1142
02:19:59,914 --> 02:20:03,601
Each of these lives
is the right one.

1143
02:20:05,224 --> 02:20:09,909
Every path
is the right path.

1144
02:20:13,475 --> 02:20:17,774
"Everything could have been
anything else..

1145
02:20:19,207 --> 02:20:23,744
and it would have just
as much meaning."

1146
02:20:25,929 --> 02:20:28,322
Tennessee Williams.

1147
02:20:30,073 --> 02:20:32,329
You're too young for that.

1148
02:20:32,692 --> 02:20:34,329
You can't be dead
and still be here.

1149
02:20:35,969 --> 02:20:37,072
You can't not exist.

1150
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:45,280
Is there life after death?

1151
02:20:48,793 --> 02:20:50,209
After death..

1152
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:59,759
How can you be so sure
you even exist?

1153
02:21:09,908 --> 02:21:12,613
You don't exist.

1154
02:21:14,146 --> 02:21:15,749
Neither do I.

1155
02:21:18,919 --> 02:21:25,194
We only live in the imagination
of a nine year old child.

1156
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:30,248
We are imagined
by a nine year old child,

1157
02:21:31,173 --> 02:21:34,107
faced with
an impossible choice.

1158
02:21:43,842 --> 02:21:45,207
Run! Run!

1159
02:21:51,463 --> 02:21:52,666
Nemo!

1160
02:21:58,287 --> 02:21:59,727
Run!

1161
02:22:04,636 --> 02:22:05,739
Run, Nemo!

1162
02:22:08,702 --> 02:22:10,010
Nemo!

1163
02:22:18,834 --> 02:22:19,979
I love you.

1164
02:22:20,815 --> 02:22:21,815
Anna!

1165
02:22:34,964 --> 02:22:35,964
Nemo!

1166
02:22:45,579 --> 02:22:47,147
You're the one I love.

1167
02:23:03,096 --> 02:23:04,258
In chess,

1168
02:23:06,647 --> 02:23:09,363
it's called Zugzwang,

1169
02:23:10,931 --> 02:23:13,326
when the only viable move

1170
02:23:18,822 --> 02:23:20,856
is not to move.

1171
02:23:30,739 --> 02:23:32,279
Come see.

1172
02:23:56,009 --> 02:23:56,827
It's the sea.

1173
02:23:57,844 --> 02:24:00,811
The child is taking it apart.

1174
02:24:02,176 --> 02:24:04,432
He doesn't need it anymore.

1175
02:24:05,651 --> 02:24:09,426
Before, he was unable
to make a choice

1176
02:24:10,342 --> 02:24:12,783
'cause he didn't know
what would happen.

1177
02:24:13,581 --> 02:24:16,406
Now that he knows
what will happen,

1178
02:24:18,554 --> 02:24:21,155
he is unable
to make a choice.

1179
02:25:26,823 --> 02:25:28,463
Thank you, thank you!

1180
02:25:28,915 --> 02:25:29,726
Thank you.

1181
02:26:06,210 --> 02:26:11,819
This is the most beautiful day
of my life.

1182
02:26:21,044 --> 02:26:21,573
Anna.

1183
02:26:25,704 --> 02:26:26,660
Anna.

1184
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:14,400
