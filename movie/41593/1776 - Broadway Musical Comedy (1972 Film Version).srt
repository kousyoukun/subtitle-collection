<i>Until you send us pins</i>

Pins, madam? Saltpeter.

- Pins. - Saltpeter.

Franklin!
富兰克林！

156
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,235
Where in hell are you?
你究竟跑哪去了？

157

I see you hiding behind that tree. It won't do you any good.
我看见你了，出来吧，藏在树后面对你没好处！

Damn it, this is no time for playing games.

Where in God's name have you been?

Do you like it?

- 很难看。 - 你总是这样，说不出好话。

164
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,663
- Well, the man's no Botticelli. - And the subject's no Venus.
- 好吧，又不是波提切利在画维纳斯。

165
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,968
Where were you last night when I needed you?
我昨天晚上最需要你的时候，你上哪去了？

166
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,974
You should have heard what I suffered in there.

I heard, all right, along with the rest of Philadelphia.

Lord, your voice is piercing, John.

169
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,406
Well, I wish to heaven my arguments were.
唉，我希望主听见了我在说什么。

170
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,851
My God, Franklin, when are they going to make up their minds?
上帝啊，富兰克林，他们什么时候才能决定啊？

171
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,945
With one hand they can raise an army
一方面，他们可以召集军队

172
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,981
dispatch one of their own to lead it and cheer the news from Bunker's Hill...

begging the king for a happy and permanent reconciliation.

175
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,694
Fat George has declared us in rebellion.

- 他们他妈的怎么能这样！ - 事实上，约翰，

177
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,831
You talk as if independence were the rule.
在你说来独立就好像是自然法则一样。

178
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,841
It's never been done before.
但这事以前从来没有发生过。

179
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,003
No colony has ever broken from the parent stem in the history of the world.
世界上从来没有殖民地脱离过母国。

180
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,014
Damn it, Franklin, you make us sound treasonous.
该死，富兰克林，你听起来就像在说我们是在谋反。

181
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,916
Do I? Treason, eh?
是吗？谋反，怎么样？

182

"Treason is a charge invented by winners...
谋反是胜利者……

183
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,522
as an excuse for hanging the losers."
为了吊死失败者找出的借口。

184
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,821
I have more to do than stand here listening to you quote yourself.
除了听你引用你自己的话，我们还得干点别的啊。

185
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,158
No, that was a new one.
不，刚才那个是刚想出来的。

186
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,493
Damn it, Franklin, we're at war.
该死的，我们现在可是战争时期了，富兰克林！

187
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,533
To defend ourselves, nothing more.
我们要防御嘛，没有别的了。

188
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,932
We expressed our displeasure, the English moved against us...

189
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,937
and we in turn have resisted.
我们就得反抗啊。

190
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,633
Now our fellow congressmen want to effect a reconciliation...
但现在我们的议员希望能在战争正式开始之前

191
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,403
- before it becomes a war. - Reconciliation, my ass.
- 签订和平条约！ - 和平条约，才怪！

192
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,604
The people want independence.
人民想要独立呀。

193
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,613
The people have read Mr. Paine's "Common Sense."
人民看了佩恩先生所著的《常识》一书。

194
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,447
- I doubt very much Congress has. - That's true.
- 我怀疑议员们应该也读了那本书。 - 这是事实。

195
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,452
John, why don't you give it up?
约翰，你为什么不放弃呢？

196
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,149
Nobody listens to you. You're obnoxious and disliked.
根本没人听你的，你被认为是讨厌又招人烦。

197
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,682
I'm not promoting John Adams. I'm promoting independence.
我又不是宣传约翰 ・ 亚当斯，我是在宣传独立呀！

198
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,025
Evidently, they cannot help connecting the two.
很明显，他们没法不把两者放在一起。

199
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,462
Even your own cousin.
你堂兄也是一样。

200
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,000
And if Sam Adams can't put up with you, nobody can.
而且如果萨姆 ・ 亚当斯都没法的话，就没人行了。

201
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,504
You're getting at something.
你说到点子上了。

202
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,538
How can you tell?
你怎么知道？

203
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,738
All right, out with it, Franklin. What new intrigue are you cooking up?
好了，摊牌吧，富兰克林。你又在想什么诡计呢？

204
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,646
Let someone else in Congress propose.
换个人来提建议书。

205
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,149
Never!
不行！

00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,922
Why? Who did you have in mind?
为什么不？你认为谁比较适合呢？

207
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,828
I don't know. I really haven't given it much thought.
不知道。我没怎么想过。

208
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,331
You sent for me, Benjamin?
本杰明，听说你找我。

209
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,598
- Never. - Hello, Johnny!
- 不。 - 你好呀，小约翰。

210
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,660
Richard.
理查德？

211
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,606
Johnny and I need some advice.
约翰和我需要一些建议。

212
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,076
- If it's mine to give, it's yours. - Thank you, Richard.
- 如果我能帮上的话。 - 太感谢了。

213
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,637
The cause that we support has come to a complete standstill.
我们是支持独立的，但是现在独立事业完全干不下去了。

214
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,650
- Why do you suppose that is? - Simple.

215
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,312
- Johnny here is obnoxious and disliked. - That's true.
- 约翰在这里实在是讨厌又招人烦。 - 没错。

216
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,321
What's the solution, I wonder?
有什么解决办法吗？

217
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,018
Get somebody else in Congress to propose.
换个人向议会提议呀。

218
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,063
Oh, Richard, that's brilliant. Wasn't that brilliant, John?
理查德，这真是个好主意！ 约翰，这不是个好主意吗？

219
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,224
- Brilliant. - The question remains who can it be.
- 好主意。 - 不过就是谁去提议呢。

220
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,393
The man that we need must belong to a delegation...
这个人必需是代表团的一员，

221
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,437
publicly committed to support independence.

222
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,098
At the present time, only Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Delaware...
不过现在只有马萨诸撒，新汉普郡和特拉华……

223
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,370

- 宣布支持。 - 还有弗吉尼亚，别忘了弗吉尼亚！

224
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,377
Richard, I haven't. How could I?
理查德，我没忘，我怎么能忘了弗吉尼亚

225
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,312
But strictly speaking, while Virginia's views on independence are well known...
不过严格上来说，虽然大家都知道弗吉尼亚支持独立

226
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,374
your legislature in Williamsburg has never formerly authorized...
你们威廉斯堡的政府却从来没有正式批准过，

227
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,318
its delegation here in Congress to support the cause.
让弗吉尼亚在议会里的代表表示支持。

228
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:26,017
If we could think of a Virginian with enough influence to go down there...
如果我们能找到一个有影响力的弗吉尼亚人

- 哎，我怎么没想到！ - 我今天晚上就走。

Why, hell, I'll leave right now, if you like.
实在不行我现在就走。

233
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,130
I'll just stop off in Stratford long enough to refresh the missus...
我只在斯特拉福停一小会，喘口气，

234
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,607
and then straight to the matter.
然后立刻就去解决问题。

235
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,578
Yes, sir, I really have to compliment you on your judgment, Johnny.
是的！约翰，真的应该称赞一下你明智的选择。

236
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,079
Whoa, boy. Steady.
哈，悠着点。

237
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,742
You've come to the one colony that can get the job done.
你选择了唯一能完成这个伟大事业的殖民地。

238
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,309
Virginia, the land that gave us our glorious commander-in-chief...
弗吉尼亚，我们光荣的总司令官，华盛顿将军，

239
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,517
George Washington...
就是个弗吉尼亚人哟，

240
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,581
will now give the continent its proposal on independence.
即将提出这个大陆的独立！

241
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,117
And when Virginia proposes, the South is bound to follow.
然后当弗吉尼亚提出了，南部各地一定会同意。

242
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,632
And where the South goes, the middle colonies go.
当南部同意时，中部殖民地也会紧随。

243
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,861
Gentlemen, a salute.
先生们，向弗吉尼亚致敬！

244
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,496
To Virginia, the mother of American independence.
美国独立的发源地！

245
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,871
Incredible. We're free and he hasn't even left yet.
真不可思议，他还没走呢，我们就已经独立了。

246
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,376
What makes you so sure you can do it?
你怎么知道你一定能说服他们？

Is that all the pride and affection you can muster...

Your petty little personal complaints:

"Your taxes are too high."

Come, come, Mr. Adams.

Nothing less will satisfy him.
别的没法满足他。

665
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,591
Violence, rebellion, treason.
暴力，暴乱，暴动。

666
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,927
Now, Mr. Adams...

are these the acts of Englishmen?

Not Englishmen, Dickinson. Americans.

669
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,810
No, sir. Englishmen!
不，英国！

670
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:50,973
Please, Mr. Dickinson, must you start banging? How is a man to sleep?
拜托，狄金森先生，非得敲桌子吗？那我怎么睡觉啊？

671
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,941
Forgive me, Dr. Franklin, but must you start speaking?
请原谅，富兰克林先生，你现在一定要提问题吗？

How is a man to stay awake?
醒了。

673
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,752
We'll promise to be quiet, sir.
我保证一定闭嘴，先生。

674
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:05,023
I'm sure everyone prefers that you remain asleep.

675
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,529
If I'm to hear myself called an Englishman, sir...
相比听见我被称作英国人，

676
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,566
I assure you I'd prefer I'd remained asleep.
我还是更愿意沉睡在梦里……

677
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,364
Oh, now, what's so terrible about being called an Englishman?
哦，被称作英国人这么难受么？

678
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,304
- The English don't seem to mind. - Nor would I...
- 那些英国佬似乎也不在意。 - 其实也没关系……

679
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,773
were I given the full rights of an Englishman.
就是我没有得到一个英国人该有的权利。

680
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:22,609
But to call me one without those rights is like calling an ox a bull.
没有那些权利，还要叫我英国人，听起来就像说我是一头牛。

681
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,944
He's thankful for the honor, but he'd much rather have restored...
这头牛愿意接受这个荣誉，只是……

682
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,448
what's rightfully his.
牛更愿意拿回原本属于它的东西。

683
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,888
When did you first notice they were missing, sir?
你从什么时候注意到你的东西找不到了？

684
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,232
Fortunately, the people of these colonies...
幸运的是，殖民地的人民……

685
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,202
maintain a higher regard for their mother country.
相当在意他们的祖国。

686
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,798
Higher, certainly, than she feels for them.
可惜祖国不怎么在意他们。

687
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,809
Never was such a valuable possession...
这块富饶的土地，

688
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,038
so stupidly and so recklessly managed...
从来没有被这么鲁莽的治理过。

689
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,979
than this entire continent by the British crown.
在整块大陆上都没有。

690
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,279
Our industry discouraged, our resources pillaged.
我们的工业被制止，资源被掠夺。

691
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,986
Worst of all, our very character stifled.
最糟糕的是，连性格都被抑制了。

692
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,385
We've spawned a new race here, Mr. Dickinson...
我们是一个新的种族，狄金森先生。

693
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:13,624
rougher, simpler, more violent, more enterprising, less refined.
更简约，更粗俗，更暴力，更有进取心，没那么有教养。

694
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,657
We're a new nationality. We require a new nation.
我们是一个新民族，我们需要一个新国家！

695
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,739
Well...
呃……

696
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,573
that may be your opinion, Dr. Franklin, but...
那是你的主意，富兰克林先生，人民……

697
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:31,979
as I said, the people feel quite differently.
像我说的，人民的感觉不一样。

698
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,416
Now, what do you know about the people, Dickinson?
你懂什么，狄金森？

699
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,944
You don't speak for the people. You represent only yourself.
你根本没替人民说话，你只说自己的意见。

700
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,253
And that precious status quo...
但现状是……

701
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,522
you keep imploring the people to preserve for their own good...
你一直跟人们说，要好自为知……

702
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:49,225
is nothing more than the eternal preservation of your own property.
其实只是为了保护你自己的财产。

703
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,064
Mr. Adams, you have an annoying talent...
亚当斯先生，你有个烦人的天赋，

704
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:58,700
for making such delightful words as "property" sound quite distasteful.
可以让“财产”这个愉快的词听起来这么可怕。

705
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,268
In heaven's name, what's wrong with property?
财产这种东西究竟怎么了？

706
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,611
Perhaps you've forgotten that many of us first came to these shores...
难道你忘记了，当我们第一次踏上这片土地，

707
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,151
in order to secure rights to property...
也是要保护自己的权利和财产……

708
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:12,552
and that we hold these rights no less dear than the rights you speak of.
而且这些权力可是跟你说的那些权力不相上下。

709
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:17,026
Yes. So safe, so fat, so comfortable in Pennsylvania.
是啊，宾夕法尼亚是肥沃，安全，舒适的土地。

710
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,619
And what is this independence of yours...
而你这个独立又是什么？

711
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,257
except the private grievance of Massachusetts?
不就是些马萨诸撒的不满嘛？

712
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,427
Why is it always Boston that breaks the king's peace?
为什么闹事的总是波士顿？

713
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:29,529
My dear Congress, you must not adopt this evil measure.
我亲爱的议员们，你们可不能听从这个邪恶的计划。

714
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,768
It is the work of the devil.
这是魔鬼的杰作。

715
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:36,745
Leave it where it belongs... in New England.
就让它留在新英格兰吧。

716
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:40,341
Brother Dickinson, New England has fought the devil more than 100 years.
狄金森，新英格兰反抗魔鬼已经100年了。

717
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,681
And as of now, Brother Sherman...
可是现在，谢尔曼……

718
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,551
the devil has been winning hands down.
这只魔鬼毫不费力就赢了。

719
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,487
Why, at this very moment, he's sitting right here in this Congress.
他现在就在这议会里安然坐着呢。

720
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,519
Don't let him deceive you. This proposal is entirely his doing.
别被他蒙骗了，这份决议书全是他的诡计。

721
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,531
Oh, it may bear Virginia's name...
可能上面写的是弗吉尼亚……

722
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,433
but it reeks of Adams, Adams and more Adams.
其实都是亚当斯，亚当斯，亚当斯。

723
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,767
Look at him. Ready to lead this continent...
看看他，就要领导这片大陆……

724
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,307
down the fiery path of total destruction.
走向毁灭。

725
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:08,778
Oh, good God! Why can't you acknowledge what already exists?
哎，上帝啊！ 为什么你就不能承认，

726
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,304
It has been more than a year since Concord and Lexington.
康科德和莱克星顿的枪声，已经响过一年了呢？

727
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,817
Damn it, man, we're at war right now!
该死，现在我们已经是战时了。

728
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,218
You may be at war. You... Boston and John Adams.
可能你们是战时，你和波士顿。

729
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,882
But you will never speak for Pennsylvania.
不过你永远也不能代表宾夕法尼亚说话。

730
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,153
- Nor for Delaware. - Mr. Read...
- 也不能代表特拉华说话。 - 里德先生……

731
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,594
you represent only one-third of Delaware.
你只能代表三分之一的特拉华。

732
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,723
The sensible third, Mr. Rodney.
最明智的三分之一，罗德尼先生。

733
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,962
Sit down, or I'll knock you down.
坐下，不然我就把你摁下来。

734
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:36,437
Sit down, all three of you! McNair, do something about that damn dog!
你们三个，都给我坐下！麦克奈尔，去处理一下那只狗！

735
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,567
- Fetch me a rum. - Get the dog first.
- 帮我拿杯朗姆酒来。 - 先去弄狗。

736
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,577
I only got two hands.
我只有两只手啊。

737
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,381
Christ, it's hot!
我主基督，这里好热。

738
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,729
Oh. Please do go on, gentlemen.
先生，继续讲吧。

739
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,166
You're making the only breeze in Philadelphia.
费城就只有你这唯一的一丝风了。

740
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:12,271
Mr. Adams, perhaps you could clear up something for me.
亚当斯先生，你能不能告诉我，

741
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,606
After we have achieved independence...
要是我们独立了……

742
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,408
who do you propose would govern in South Carolina?
你将派谁来管理南卡罗来纳？

743
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,750
The people, of course.
当然是人民。

744
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,151
Which people, sir? The people of South Carolina...
哪个人民？南卡罗来纳人民，

745
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,621
or the people of Massachusetts?
还是马萨诸塞人民？

746
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,354
Admit it, Neddy. You're against independence now and you always will be.
承认吧，耐迪，你就总是反对独立。

747
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,952
Aye.
没错。

748
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,365
Gentlemen, you refuse to understand us.
先生，你理解错了……

749
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:41,927
We desire independence. Yes.
我们也想独立，是。

750
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:46,066
For South Carolina. That is our country.
为了南卡罗来纳，这是我们的国家。

751
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,340
And as such, we don't wish to belong to anyone.
同样，我们不希望属于任何人。

752
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,314
Not to England and not to you.
不属于英国，也不会属于你！

753
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,846
We intend to have one nation, Rutledge.
我们是想要建立一个国家，拉特里奇。

754
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,116
A nation of sovereign states, Mr. Adams.
由独立的州组成的国家，亚当斯先生。

755
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,386
United for our mutual protection, but...
我们共同防卫……

756
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,927
separate for our individual pursuits.
但是追求不同。

757
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,089
Now, that is what we have understood it to be...
这就是我们想要的，

758
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,464
and that is what we will support.
如果大家都支持，

759
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,395
As soon as everyone supports it.
我们也会支持。

760
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,801
Well, there you are, Mr. Adams.
看见了吧，亚当斯先生。

761
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,404
You must see that we need time.
我们需要时间。

762
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:29,919
Time to make certain who we are and where we stand in regard to one another.
我们需要时间看看，我们究竟站那一边。

763
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,821
For if we do not determine the nature of the beast before we set it free...
如果再放掉野兽之前不先确定它的本性，

764
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,553
it will end by consuming us all.
