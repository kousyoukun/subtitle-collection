1
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,606
Mr. Adams!

2
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,735
Mr. Adams!

3
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,404
Mr. Adams!

4
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,240
There you are.

5
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:39,118
Didn't you hear me call you, Mr. Adams?

6
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:43,664
You could've shouted down something,
saved me climbing up four flights.

7
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:47,293
A man that likes to talk
as much as you do, I'd think...

8
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,048
What do you keep coming
up here for, Mr. Adams?

9
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,925
Afraid someone's going to steal our bell?

10
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,345
Well, don't worry.

11
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:01,265
Been here more than 14 years,
and ain't been carried off once.

12
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,855
Better get yourself
back down to congress, Mr. Adams.

13
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,859
Getting ready to vote, and they said they
couldn't settle such an important question

14
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,403
without Massachusetts being there.

15
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,865
I can just imagine.

16
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,208
All right. What burning issue
are we voting on this time?

17
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,212
On whether or not
to Grant general Washington's request

18
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,673
that all members
of the Rhode Island militia be required

19
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,801
to wear matching uniforms.

20
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,970
Oh, good god.

21
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,093
I have come to the conclusion

22
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,431
that one useless man is called a disgrace,

23
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,726
that two are called a law firm,

24
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,565
and that three or more become a congress.

25
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:36,277
And, by god, I have had this congress.

26
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,155
For 10 years,
king George and his parliament

27
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,659
have gulled, cullied and diddled
these colonies with their illegal taxes.

28
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,746
Stamp acts,
townshend acts, sugar acts, tea acts.

29
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,541
And when we dared stand up like men,

30
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,794
they have stopped our trade,
seized our ships,

31
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,672
blockaded our ports, burned our towns,

32
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,383
and spilled our blood.

33
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:04,805
And still this congress refuses to Grant
any of my proposals on independence

34
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,184
even so much as the courtesy
of open debate.

35
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,312
Good god,
what in the hell are you waiting for?

36
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,483
<i>Sit down, John. Sit down, John</i>

37
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,318
Thomas, for god's sake, listen to me.

38
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,111
<i>For god's sake, John, sit down</i>

39
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,155
I've had enough of you, sir.

40
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,781
<i>Sit down, John sit down, John</i>

41
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,493
<i>for god's sake, John, sit down</i>

42
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,161
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

43
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,004
will you listen to me
and forget the window?

44
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,247
<i>It's 90 degrees</i>

45
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,124
<i>have mercy, John, please</i>

46
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,502
<i>it's hot as hell in Philadelphia</i>

47
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,087
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

48
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,673
<i>I say vote yes</i>

49
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,550
<i>vote yes</i>

50
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,844
<i>vote for independency</i>

00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:46,514
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

52
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,766
<i>I say vote yes</i>

53
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,768
<i>sit down, John</i>

54
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,853
<i>vote for independency</i>

55
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:55,314
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

56
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,398
<i>no, no, no!</i>

57
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,777
<i>Too many flies, too many flies</i>

58
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,530
<i>but it's hot as hell in Philadelphia</i>

59
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,657
<i>are you gonna open up a window?</i>

60
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,700
<i>Can't we compromise here?</i>

61
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,118
<i>Vote yes</i>

62
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,371
<i>no, too many flies here</i>

63
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,872
<i>vote yes</i>

64
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:14,667
<i>oh, for god's sake, John, sit down</i>

65
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,336
good god. Consider yourselves fortunate

66
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,421
that you have John Adams to abuse,

67
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,674
for no sane man would tolerate it.

68
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,217
<i>John, you're a bore</i>

69
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,177
<i>we've heard this before</i>

70
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,638
<i>now, for god's sake, John, sit down</i>

71
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,015
<i>- I say vote yes
- no!</i>

72
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,809
<i>- Vote yes
- no!</i>

73
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,061
<i>Vote for independency</i>

74
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,146
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

75
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,899
<i>I say vote yes</i>

76
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,235
<i>sit down, John</i>

77
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,029
<i>vote for independency</i>

78
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,240
<i>will someone shut that man up?</i>

79
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,950
Never!

80
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,619
Never!

81
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,750
Dear god.

82
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,339
For one solid year
they have been sitting here. A whole year!

83
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:03,924
Doing nothing!

84
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:09,388
<i>I do believe
you've laid a curse on north America</i>

85
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,394
<i>a curse that we
here now rehearse in Philadelphia</i>

86
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,605
<i>a second flood, a simple famine</i>

87
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,607
<i>plagues of locusts everywhere</i>

88
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,568
<i>or a cataclysmic earthquake</i>

89
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,611
<i>I'd accept with some despair</i>

90
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:28,282
<i>but, no, you've sent us congress</i>

91
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,703
<i>good god, sir, was that fair?</i>

92
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:39,626
<i>I say this with humility in Philadelphia</i>

93
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,299
<i>we're your responsibility in Philadelphia</i>

94
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,637
<i>if you don't want to see us hanging
from some far off British hill</i>

95
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,516
<i>if you don't want the voice of independency
forever stilled</i>

96
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,020
<i>then god, sir, get thee to it</i>

97
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,232
<i>for congress never will</i>

98
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,402
<i>you see, we piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

99
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,571
<i>not one damn thing do we solve</i>

100
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,740
<i>piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

101
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,575
<i>nothing's ever solved</i>

102
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,162
<i>in foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy</i>

103
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,539
<i>Philadelphia</i>

104
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,959
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

105
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,711
shut up.

106
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:27,383
<i>I now call congress' attention
to the petition of Mr. melchior meng,</i>

107
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,552
<i>who claims $20 compensation
for his dead mule.</i>

108
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,180
<i>It seems the animal was employed
transporting luggage</i>

109
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,681
<i>in the service of congress.</i>

110
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,893
<i>The question, then,
would appear to be one of occasion.</i>

111
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,605
<i>For if the mule expired not while carrying,</i>

112
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,941
<i>but after being unloaded,</i>

113
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,444
<i>then clearly the beast dropped dead
on its own time.</i>

114
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,822
Oh, good god.

115
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:56,203
<i>They may sit here for years and years
in Philadelphia</i>

116
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:02,251
<i>these indecisive grenadiers of Philadelphia</i>

117
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:07,423
<i>they can't agree on what is right and wrong
or what is good or bad</i>

118
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,009
<i>I'm convinced the only purpose
this congress ever had</i>

119
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:14,388
<i>was to gather here specifically</i>

120
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,808
<i>to drive John Adams mad!</i>

121
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,061
<i>You see, we piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

122
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,938
<i>not one damn thing do we solve</i>

123
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,065
<i>piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

124
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,650
<i>nothing's ever solved</i>

125
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,070
<i>in foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy</i>

126
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,155
<i>Philadelphia</i>

127
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>John, john</i>

128
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:37,202
<i>ls that you carrying on, John?</i>

129
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,833
Abigail, Abigail, I have such a desire
to knock heads together.

130
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,419
<i>Then why
in heaven's name do you stay there?</i>

131
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,589
<i>Come home to Boston, John.
It's only 300 miles.</i>

132
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,258
<i>If you left tonight,
you could be here in only eight days.</i>

133
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,635
How can I do that, Abigail?

134
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:57,264
I'm no further along now than I was
when I first came here.

135
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,266
I know, my dearest. I know.

136
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,311
But that's because you make
everything so complicated.

137
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,146
It's all quite simple, really.

138
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,441
<i>Just tell the congress to declare</i>

139
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,819
<i>independency</i>

140
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,071
<i>then sign your name get out of there</i>

141
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,742
<i>and hurry home to me</i>

142
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,495
<i>our children all have dysentery</i>

143
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,705

<i>little Abby has the measles</i>

145
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,043

<i>they say we may get smallpox</i>

147
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,840
madam, what else is new?

148
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,095
Abigail, in my last letter, I wrote you

149
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,850
that the king had collected 12,000
German mercenaries to send against us.

150
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:46,438
I asked you to organize the ladies
to make saltpeter for gunpowder.

151
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,441
- Now, have you done as I asked?
- No, John, I have not.

152
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,109
Well, why have you not?

153
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:54,363
Because you neglected
to tell us how saltpeter is made.

154
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,408
By treating sodium nitrate
with potassium chloride, of course.

155
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,826
Oh, yes, of course.

156
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,036
Will it be done, then?

157
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,872
John, I'm afraid
we have a more urgent problem.

158
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,624
More urgent, madam?

159
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,254
<i>There's one thing every woman's missed
in Massachusetts bay</i>

160
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,758
<i>don't smirk at me, you egotist</i>

161
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,637
<i>pay heed to what I say</i>

162
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,098
<i>we've gone from framingham to Boston</i>

163
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,058
<i>and we cannot find a pin</i>

164
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,646
<i>"don't you know there's a war on"
say the tradesmen with a grin</i>

165
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:32,317
<i>well, we will not make saltpeter</i>

166
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:36,572
<i>until you send us pins</i>

167
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,824
pins, madam? Saltpeter.

168
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,951
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.

169
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,286
Pins.

170
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,495
- Saltpeter.
- Pins.

171
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,579
- Saltpeter.
- Pins.

172
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,664
- 'Peter.
- Pins.

173
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,124
- 'Peter. 'Peter.
- Pins. Pins.

174
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,417
'Peter!

175
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,586

Done, madam, done.

177
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,799
Done, John.

178
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,303
Hurry home, John.

179
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,554
As soon as I'm able.

180
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,514
Don't stop writing. It's all I have.

181
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,766

Franklin!

200
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,509
Where in hell are you?

201
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,178
Franklin!

202
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,681
I see you hiding behind that tree.

203
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,724
It won't do you any good.

204
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,770
Damn it, this is no time for playing games.

205
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,817
Franklin, I have been looking
everywhere for you.

206
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,194
Where in god's name have you been?

207
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,239
Right here, John,
being preserved for posterity.

208
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,865
Do you like it?

209
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,246
It stinks.

210
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,914
As ever, the soul of tact.

211
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,499
Well, the man's no botticelli.

212
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,459
And the subject's no Venus.

213
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,421
Franklin, where were you last night
when I needed you?

214
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,344
You should have heard
what I suffered in there.

215
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,801
I heard, all right.
Along with the rest of Philadelphia.

216
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,636
Lord, your voice is piercing, John.

217
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,514
Well, I wish to heaven my arguments were.

218
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,143
My god, Franklin,
when are they going to make up their minds?

219
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,980
With one hand they can raise an army,
dispatch one of their own to lead it,

220
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,315
and cheer the news from bunker's hill.

221
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,152
And with the other,
they wave the olive branch,

222
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,280
begging the king for a happy
and permanent reconciliation.

223
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,949
Fat George has declared us in rebellion.

224
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,617
Why in bloody hell can't they?

225
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,246
John, really?
You talk as if independence were the rule.

226
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,165
It's never been done before.

227
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:36,208
No colony has ever broken from the
parent stem in the history of the world.

228
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,337
Damn it, Franklin,
you make us sound treasonous.

229
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,006
<i>Do i'.></i>

230
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,466
treason, eh?

231
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:47,846
Treason is a charge invented by winners
as an excuse for hanging the losers.

232
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,308
I have more to do than stand here,
listening to you quote yourself.

233
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,560
No, that was a new one.

234
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,854
Damn it, Franklin, we're at war.

235
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,856
To defend ourselves, nothing more.

236
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,567
We expressed our displeasure,
the English moved against us,

237
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,110
and we in turn have resisted.

238
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,864
Now our fellow congressmen want to effect
a reconciliation before it becomes a war.

239
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,616
Reconciliation, my ass.

240
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,701
The people want independence.

241
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,745
<i>The people have read
Mr. paine's common sense.</i>

242
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,122
I doubt very much congress has.

243
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,791
That's true.

244
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,667
John, why don't you give it up?

245
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,212
Nobody listens to you.
You're obnoxious and disliked.

246
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,050
L'm not promoting John Adams.
I'm promoting independence.

247
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,344
Evidently, they cannot help
connecting the two.

248
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,805
Even your own cousin.

249
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,141
And if Sam Adams can't put up with you,
nobody can.

250
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,811
You're getting at something.

251
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,772
How can you tell?

252
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,124
All right, outwith it, Franklin.

253
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,651
What new intrigue are you cooking up?

254
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,154
Let someone else in congress propose.

255
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,198
Never!

256
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,333
Why? Who did you have in mind?

257
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,627
I don't know.
I really haven't given it much thought.

258
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,881
You sent for me, Benjamin?

259
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,758
Never.

260
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:10,011
- Hello, Johnny!
- Richard.

261
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,514
Johnny and I need some advice.

262
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,016
If it's mine to give, it's
yours, you know that.

263
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,351
Thank you, Richard.

264
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,938
As you know, the cause that we support
has come to a complete standstill.

265
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,940
- Now why do you suppose that is?
- Simple.

266
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,526
- Johnny here is obnoxious and disliked.
- That's true.

267
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,112
Now, what's the solution, I wonder?

268
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,366
Get somebody else in congress to propose.

269
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,076
Richard, that's brilliant.

270
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,078
- Wasn't that brilliant, John?
- Brilliant.

271
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,372
Yes. Now the question remains,
who can it be?

272
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,749
The man that we need
must belong to a delegation

273
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,710
publicly committed
to support independence.

274
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,521
And at the present time,
only Massachusetts,

275
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,273
New Hampshire
and Delaware have declared our way.

276
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,674
And Virginia. Don't forget Virginia, benjy.

277
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,384
Richard, I haven't. How could I?

278
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,637
But strictly speaking, while Virginia's
views on independence are well known,

279
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,765
your legislature in williamsburg
has never formally authorized

280
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,643
its delegation here in congress
to support the cause.

281
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,439
Now, if we could think of a virginian
with enough influence to go down there

282
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,149
and persuade the house of burgesses...

283
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,235
Damn me if I haven't thought of someone!

284
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,445
'Who?
'Who?

285
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,529
Me.

286
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,156
Why didn't I think of that?

287
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,782
I'll leave tonight.

288
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,410
Why, hell, I'll leave
right now, if you like.

289
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,538
I'll just stop off in stratford long enough
to refresh the missus,

290
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,041
and then straight to the matter.

291
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,960
Yes, sir. I really have to compliment
you on yourjudgment, Johnny.

292
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,462
Whoa, boy. Steady.

293
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,381
You've come to the one colony
that can get the job done.

294
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,676
Virginia, the land that gave
us our glorious commander in chief,

295
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,887
George Washington,

296
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,307
will now give the continent
its proposal on independence.

297
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,560
And when Virginia proposes,
the south is bound to follow.

298
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:44,064
And where the south goes,
the middle colonies go.

299
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,149
Gentlemen, a salute.

300
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,903
To Virginia,
the mother of American independence.

301
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,281
Incredible. We're free,
and he hasn't even left yet.

302
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,992
What makes you so sure you can do it?

303
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,206
<i>My name is Richard Henry Lee
Virginia is my home</i>

304
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:06,586

349
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,070
<i>if I can't deliver up to you</i>

350
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,656
<i>the resolution on independency</i>

351
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,951
<i>yes, sir, my god, it's
here</i> a <i>Lee,</i> there a Lee

352
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,037
<i>come on, boys, join in with me!</i>

353
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,890
<i>- Here a Lee, there a Lee
- here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

354
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,915
<i>when do you leave?</i>

355
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,041
<i>Immediate-Lee!</i>

356
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,061
<i>- Here a Lee, there a Lee
- here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

357
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,211
<i>when will you return?</i>

358
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,295
<i>Short-Lee!</i>

359
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,190
<i>- Here a Lee, there a Lee
- here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

360
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,216
<i>and I'll come back triumphant-Lee!</i>

361
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,510
<i>Here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

362
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,428
<i>everywhere a Lee, a Lee</i>

363
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,388
<i>forward</i>

364
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:28,269
<i>ho</i>

365
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,862
That was the most revolting display
i have ever witnessed.

366
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,823
They're a warm-blooded people, virginians.

367
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,033
Not him, Franklin. You.

368
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,744
You and your infernal obsession
for deviousness.

369
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,973
If you'd come straight out and asked the
man, he'd have been gone a half hour ago.

370
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,291
Yes, and he'd have been doing us a favor.

371
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,378
Cheer up, John. At this very moment,
our cause is again riding high,

372
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,506
sitting straight in the saddle
and in full gallop for Virginia.

373
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,760
<i>And our women are serene</i>

374
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:01,886
good god.

375
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,763
<i>Full-bosomed</i>

376
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,891
<i>full-bosomed</i>

377
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:11,813
<i>full-bosomed, benjy
everyone a queen</i>

378
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,109
<i>why they are lees, damn it
lees of old Virginia!</i>

379
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,195
<i>Yes, sir, by god, it's
here a Lee, there a Lee!</i>

380
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,489
<i>C'mon, John, step lively</i>

381
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,658
<i>- here a Lee, there a Lee
- here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

382
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,511
<i>- everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee
- everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee</i>

383
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,388
<i>- here a Lee, there a Lee
- here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

384
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,223
<i>- everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee!
- Everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee!</i>

385
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:33,168
<i>Forward, ho</i>

386
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,743
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

387
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,580
I'm Dr. lyman hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.

388
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,042
I'm Andrew mcnair, congressional custodian.

389
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,003
If you'll be wanting anything at all,
just holler out "mcnair"

390
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,673
as all the others do
and there won't be too long to wait.

391
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,927
Where does the Georgia delegation belong?

392
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,097
They mill about over there in that corner,
near the two carolinas.

393
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,022
It's after 10:00.

394
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,149
I was told congress convenes at 10:00.

395
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:42,362
Well, they'll be wandering in
any time now, sir, with old grape and guts

396
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,280
- leading the pack.
- Old who?

397
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,740
Mcnair!

398
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,116
Grape and guts.

399
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,868
'Nair!

400
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,496
Fetch me a rum.

401
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,667
Mr. Hopkins,
you'll be pleased to meet Dr. lyman hall.

402
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,920
I don't need a doctor, damn it.

403
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,256
New delegate from Georgia.

404
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,466
Well, why didn't you say so?

405
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:08,137
I'm Stephen Hopkins,
old delegate from Rhode Island.

406
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,764
Mcnair, fetch two rums.

407
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,475
I fear it's a little early in the day.

408
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,187
Nonsense.

409
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:20,733
It's a medicinal fact that rum
gets a man's heart started in the morning.

410
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,529
I'm surprised you didn't know that.

411
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,073
Speaking as the oldest man
in the congress, I can tell you...

412
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:30,159
Ben Franklin is older by almost a year.

413
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,452
Rum!

414
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,501
Tell me, doctor.

415
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,796
Where does Georgia stand
on the question of independence?

416
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,173
With south Carolina, of course.

417
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,968
Neddy, good morning.

418
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,221
Neddy, come over here and shake the hand
of Dr. lyman hall of Georgia.

419
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:53,266
Dr. hall, this here is
Edward Rutledge from...

420
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,811
Whichever Carolina he says he's from.
God knows I can't keep them straight.

421
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,272
- It's a pleasure, Dr. hall.
- Your servant, Mr. Rutledge.

422
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,191
You've met the long
and the short of it now, doctor.

423
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,986
Neddy here is just a lad.
He's the youngest of us.

424
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,696
Except for Ben Franklin.

425
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,073
- Mcnair!
- Your rum!

426
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,577
Well, where did you go for it, man?
Jamaica?

427
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,371
Well, now, come along, Dr. hall.

428
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:19,500
I know you must be anxious
to meet your colleagues from the south.

429
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,296
Doctor, may I present to you Joseph Hewes.

430
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,049
This is Dr. lyman hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.

431
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,532
An honor and a pleasure, gentlemen.

432
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,469
Where do you stand on independence,
Dr. hall?

433
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,138
I'm here without instructions, Mr. Hewes,

434
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,016
able to vote my own personal convictions.

435
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,268
And they are?

436
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,607
Personal.

437
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,651
Now, Dr. hall,

438
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,780
the deep south speaks with one voice.

439
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,239
It's traditional.

440
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,493
Even more, it is historical.

441
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,079
Enter Delaware.

442
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,457
Speak plain, Rutledge.

443
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,418
You know I can't follow a word
of your damn French.

444
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,170
It's Latin, colonel mckean,

445
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:08,007
a tribute to the eternal peace and Harmony
of the Delaware delegation.

446
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,927
What are you saying, man?
You know perfectly well

447
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,180
that neither Rodney nor i
can stand the sight of this louse.

448
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,306
Now, Thomas...

449
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,516
Gentlemen, please.

450
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,727
This is Dr. lyman hall of Georgia.

451
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,771
Caesar Rodney.

452
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:22,897
- An honor, sir.
- Sir.

453
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,526
George read and colonel Thomas mckean.

454
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:27,729
- Dr. hall...
- Your servant.

455
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,114
I wonder if I might speak
to you for a moment in private.

456
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,365
By all means.

457
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,661
Mcnair!

458
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,287
I'm coming! I'm coming!

459
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,706
Help me. I'm stuck.

460
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,211
Tell me, sir,

461
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:50,049
would you be a doctor
of medicine or theology?

462
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,302
Both, Mr. Rodney.
Which one can be of service?

463
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,972
By all means, the physician first.

464
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,516
Then we shall see about the other.

465
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,894
I shall call at your convenience, sir.

466
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:15,700
I trust, Caesar, when you're through
converting the poor fellow to independency

467
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:19,078
that you'll give
the opposition a fair crack at him.

468
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,415
You're too late, John.

469
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,959
Once I get them, they're got.

470
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:30,006
Dr. lyman hall of Georgia,
Mr. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania.

471
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,675
- An honor, sir.
- Your servant, sir.

472
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,927
Tell me, doctor.

473
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,804
Where do you stand on the question of...

474
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,264
Independence?

475
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,765
Treason.

476
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,936
I've no stomach for it.

477
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,064
Then be careful not to
dine with John Adams.

478
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,691
Between the fish and the souffle,

479
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,486
you'll find yourself
hanging from an English rope.

480
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,778
Your servant, sir.

481
00:26:56,282 --> 00:27:00,578
Judge Wilson, forgive me,
but how can anyone see you

482
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,624
if you insist on standing
in Mr. Dickinson's shadow?

483
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,795
James Wilson, also of Pennsylvania.

484
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:10,963
Sir.

485
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,841
An honor, sir.

486
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,802
Good morning. Good morning.

487
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,682
Good morning, ladies. Good morning.

488
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,309
Steady, steady.

489
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,647
Make gangway, sir. Make gangway!

490
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,982
Good morning, Mr. Wilson. Good morning.

491
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,069
Watch where you're going, damn it.
Over there.

492
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,405
Mcnair, get me out of this thing.

493
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,616
Watch out for my foot.

494
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,825
Good morning, all.

495
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,869
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, Ben.

496
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:45,540
Here you are. Two coppers apiece.
Now, straight back to jail with you.

497
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,209
- Good morning, Stephen.
- All right, Benjamin.

498
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,545
Dear god.

499
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,632
What are you staring at?

500
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,926
Haven't you ever seen a great man before?

501
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,303
Good lord, sir.
Do you have the honor to be Dr. Franklin?

502
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:03,349
Yes, I have that honor. Unfortunately,
the gout accompanies the honor.

503
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,952
Been living too high again, eh, pappy?

504
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,938
Stephen, I only wish king George
felt like my big toe all over.

505
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:14,485
Mcnair! Fetch a pillow and two more rums.

506
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,004
Well, Franklin, where's that idiot Lee?

507
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,655
Is he back yet? I don't see him.

508
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,491
Softly, John. Your voice
is hurting my foot.

509
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:24,161
One more Clay, Franklin. That's how long
I'll remain silent, not a minute longer.

510
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,789
That strutting popinjay
was so damn sure of himself.

511
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,083
He's had time to bring back
a dozen proposals by now.

512
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,209
Tell me, James.

513
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:33,629
How do you explain the strange,
monumental quietude

514
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,215
that congress has been treated
to these past 30 days?

515
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,927
Has the ill wind
of independence finally blown itself out?

516
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,638
Well, if you ask me...

517
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:46,392
For myself, I must confess
that a month free from new england noise

518
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,436
is more therapeutic
than a month in the country.

519
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,146
Don't you agree, James?

520
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,355
Well, lfeel...

521
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,482
Mr. Adams, pray look for your voice, sir.

522
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:58,237
It cannot be far, and god knows we need
the entertainment in congress.

523
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,659
Congratulations, John.

524
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,762
You just made
your greatest contribution to independence.

525
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,079
You kept your flap shut.

526
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,581
One more day, Franklin.

527
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,916
Then I shall do the proposing.

528
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,963
Gentlemen, the usual morning
festivities concluded,

529
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,466
I will now call congress to order.

530
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,384
Mr. thomson.

531
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,600
The second continental congress meeting in
the city of Philadelphia is now in session.

532
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,228
7 June, 1776, the 380th meeting.

533
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,938
Sweet Jesus!

534
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,110
The honorable John hancock
of Massachusetts bay, president.

535
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:43,032
Thank you, Mr. thomson. Mr. mcnair.

536
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,452
The stores of rum and other
drinking spirits are hereby closed

537
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:50,039
to the colony of Rhode Island
for a period of three days.

538
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,499
Yes, sir.

539
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,376
Johnny, you can't do that.

540
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,754
Sit down, Mr. Hopkins.
You've abused the privilege.

541
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,133
The chair would like to
take this opportunity

542
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,178
to welcome Dr. lyman hall of Georgia
to this congress,

543
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,263
and hopes he will make the best of it.

544
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,352
My god, it's hot.

545
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,563
The secretary will read the roll.

546
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,899
All members present
with the following exceptions.

547
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,236
"Mr. paine, Mr. Gerry,
Mr. Samuel Adams of Massachusetts,

548
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,987
"Mr. Morton of Pennsylvania,

549
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:24,323
"Mr. wythe and
Mr. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia."

550
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,576
And the entire delegation of New Jersey.

551
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,829
I'm concerned over the continual absence

552
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:33,040
of one-thirteenth of this congress.
Where is New Jersey?

553
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,335
Somewhere between
New York and Pennsylvania.

554
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,590
Thank you very much.

555
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:46,137
Dr. Franklin, have you heard anything?
Your son resides there.

556
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,471
Son, sir? What son?

557
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:51,058
The royal governor of New Jersey, sir.

558
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,769
As that title might suggest, sir,

559
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,188
we are not in touch at the present time.

560
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,441
Yes. Well...

561
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,943
Now for the weather report,

562
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,028
Mr. Jefferson of Virginia.

563
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,323
Mr. Jefferson!

564
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:08,534
Present, sir.

565
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,703
May we hear about the weather?

566
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,581
As if it weren't speaking for itself.

567
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,793
Eighty-seven degrees of temperature,

568
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,880
thirty-point-aught-six inches of Mercury.

569
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,715
Wind...

570
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,093
From the southwest for the rest of the day.

571
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,636
And tonight...

572
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,972
Tonight I'm leaving for home.

573
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,515
On business?

574
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,683
Family business.

575
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,519
Give her a flourish for me, young feller.

576
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,883
"From the commander,
army of the united colonies to New York,

577
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,344
"dispatch number 1,137."

578
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,596
Sweet Jesus!

579
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,741
"To the honorable congress,
John hancock, president.

580
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:16,519
"Dear sir, it is with grave apprehension
that I have learned this day

581
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,729
"of the sailing from halifax, Nova Scotia,

582
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:22,233
"of a considerable force of British troops
in the company of foreign mercenaries

583
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,902
"and under the command
of general sir William howe."

584
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,446
"There can be no doubt
that their destination is New York,

585
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,699
"for to take and hold this city
and the Hudson valley beyond

586
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,619
"would serve to separate new england
from the rest of the colonies,

587
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,747
"permitting both sections
to be crushed in turn.

588
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,416
"Sadly, I see no way
of stopping them at the present time,

589
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,877
"as my army is absolutely falling apart.

590
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,963
"My military chest is totally exhausted.

591
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,299
"My commissary general
has strained his credit to the last.

592
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,970
"My quartermaster has no food,
no arms, no ammunition,

593
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:54,014
"and my troops are in a
state of near mutiny.

594
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:58,978
"L pray god some relief arrives
before the armada, but fear it will not.

595
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,604
"Your obedient,

596
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,399
"g. Washington."

597
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,734
Mr. president!

598
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:06,819
Colonel mckean.

599
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,488
Surely we have managed to promote

600
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:13,701
the gloomiest man on this continent
to the head of our troops.

601
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:18,080
Those dispatches
are the most depressing accumulation

602
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:23,460
of disaster, doom and despair
in the entire annals of military history.

603
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,255
Colonel mckean, please!

604
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,339
What?

605
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,842
It's too hot.

606
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,803
Well, I suppose so.

607
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,892
General Washington will continue
wording his dispatches as he sees fit.

608
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,935
And I'm sure we all pray

609
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,939
he finds happier thoughts
to convey in the near future.

610
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,109
Mr. thomson, are there any resolutions?

611
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,695
Dr. Josiah bartlett of New Hampshire.

612
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:54,158
"Resolved, that for the duration
of the present hostilities,

613
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,620
"the congress discourage
every type of extravagance and dissipation,

614
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,331
"elaborate funerals
and other expensive diversions,

615
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,334
"especially all horse racing, gambling,

616
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,086
"and other forms of sinful
activity, which..."

617
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,630
Fire wagon!

618
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,398
Where's the fire? Can anybody tell?

619
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:29,122
- Looks like the Pemberton house.
- It couldn't be. It's brand new.

620
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:32,571
- It might be the city tavern.
- Bite your tongue, man.

621
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,290
Benjy, I'm back!

622
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,002
- L'm back, Johnny!
- Richard, lad, welcome back.

623
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:51,882
Lee, is it done?

624
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,759
First things first. Tom!

625
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:58,222
Tom! Tom, your little bride wants to know,
"when's he coming home?"

626
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,390
I leave tonight.

627
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,016
Never mind that, man. Ls it done?

628
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,268
Done? Why, certain-Lee.

629
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:07,856
Mr. president, I have returned from
Virginia with the following resolution,

630
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,485
"resolved, that these united colonies are,
and of a right ought to be,

631
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,028
"free and independent states,

632
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,823
"that they are absolved
from allegiance to the British crown,

633
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,284
"and that all political connection between
them and the state of Great Britain is,

634
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,037
"and ought to be, totally dissolved."

635
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,288
Hear, hear!

636
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:26,166
Mr. president, I second the proposal.

637
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,127
The resolution has been proposed
and seconded.

638
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,754
The chair will now entertain debate.

639
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,298
- Mr. Dickinson.
- Mr. president.

640
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,718
Pennsylvania moves, as always,

641
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,930
that the question
of independence be postponed indefinitely.

642
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:41,807
I second the motion.

643
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,726
Judge Wilson,

644
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,062
in your eagerness to be loved,
you seem to have forgotten

645
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,107
that Pennsylvania
cannot second its own motion.

646
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,235
Delaware seconds.

647
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,612
You would, you lousy wart.

648
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:59,324
The motion to postpone
has been moved and seconded.

649
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,826
Mr. thomson.

650
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,121
On the motion to postpone indefinitely

651
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,041
the resolution on independency
or proceed with the debate,

652
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,792
all those in favor of debate say "yea,"

653
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,419
all those for postponement say "nay."

654
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,587
New Hampshire?

655
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,715
New Hampshire favors debate, and says yea.

656
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,178
New Hampshire says yea. Massachusetts?

657
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:24,266
Massachusetts, having borne the brunt
of the king's tyranny...

658
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,351
Yes, I said tyranny!

659
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,105
Massachusetts now,
and for all time, says yea.

660
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,525
Massachusetts says yea.

661
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,360
Rhode Island?

662
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,780
Mr. Hopkins?

663
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,907
Where's Rhode Island?

664
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,951
Rhode Island is out visiting the necessary.

665
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,580
After what Rhode Island's consumed,
i can't say I'm surprised.

666
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,582
We'll come back to him, Mr. thomson.

667
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,417
Rhode Island passes.

668
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,298
Connecticut?

669
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,969
While Connecticut has, till now,

670
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,305
been against this proposal,

671
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,350
our legislature
has instructed me that in the event

672
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,645
it is introduced by any colony
outside of new england,

673
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,107
we could not any longer
withhold our support. Connecticut says yea.

674
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,316
Hear! Hear!

675
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,735
Connecticut says yea. New York?

676
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,656
New York abstains courteously.

677
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,407
New York abstains.

678
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,534
Courteously.

679
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,829
New Jersey?

680
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,330
Absent, Mr. secretary.

681
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,292
New Jersey's absent. Pennsylvania?

682
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,630
Pennsylvania, for the 24th time, says nay.

683
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,882
Pennsylvania says nay. Delaware?

684
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:44,680
Delaware, as ever for independence,
says yea.

685
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,182
Delaware says yea. Maryland?

686
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,478
Maryland would welcome independence
if it were given,

687
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,773
but is highly skeptical
that it can be taken.

688
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:56,525
Maryland says nay.

689
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,529
Maryland says nay. Virginia?

690
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,365
Virginia, the first colony, says yea!

691
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:09,037
Virginia says yea. North Carolina?

692
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:13,417
North Carolina
respectfully yields to south Carolina.

693
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,543
South Carolina?

694
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,128
Mr. president,

695
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:20,257
although we of south Carolina
have never seriously considered

696
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,551
the question of independence,

697
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:26,471
when a gentleman proposes it,
attention must be paid.

698
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:31,685
However, we in the deep south,

699
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,729
unlike our friends in new england,

700
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,441
have no cause for impatience
at the present time.

701
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,904
If at some future date it becomes the
wish of all our sister colonies,

702
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,908
to effect a separation,
we will not stand in the way.

703
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,826
But for the time being,

704
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,121
south Carolina will wait and watch.

705
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,707
The vote is nay.

706
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,044
North Carolina...

707
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,463
Says nay. Yes, Mr. Hewes. I know.

708
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,133
Georgia.

709
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,804
Georgia.

710
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:14,269
Mr. president, Georgia seems to be split
right down the middle on this issue.

711
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:17,189
The people are against it, and I'm for it.

712
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,903
However, I'm afraid I'm not quite certain

713
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:27,115
whether representing the people means
relying on theirjudgment or on my own.

714
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,912
In all fairness, until I can figure that
out, I'd better lean a little on their side.

715
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,205
Georgia says nay.

716
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,962
Georgia says nay.

717
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,588
Rhode Island?

718
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,926
Second call, Rhode Island!

719
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,262
Rhode Island!

720
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,973
I'm coming! I'm coming!

721
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,350
Hold your damn horses.

722
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,937
- We're waiting on you, Mr. Hopkins.
- Well, it won't kill you.

723
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,482
You'd think the congress
would have its own privy.

724
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,609
All right, where does she stand?

725
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:06,530
Five for debate, five for postponement,
one abstention and one absence.

726
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,407
So it's up to me, huh?

727
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,534
Well, I'll tell you.

728
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:15,080
In all my years,
i never seen, heard nor smelled an issue

729
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,000
that was so dangerous
it couldn't be talked about.

730
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,837
Hell, yes! I'm for debating anything.
Rhode Island says yea.

731
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,926
- Mcnair, get Mr. Hopkins a rum.
- But you said...

732
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,679
Get him the whole damn barrel if he wants.

733
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,057
The chair now declares this congress
a committee of the whole

734
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:37,561
for the purpose of debating
Virginia's resolution on independence.

735
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,146
Mr. Dickinson.

736
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:45,986
Well, now,
you've got your way at last, Mr. Adams.

737
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,697
The matter may now be discussed.

738
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,992
I confess I'm almost relieved.

739
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:56,163
There's a question
I've been fairly itching to ask you.

740
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,624
Why?

741
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,918
Why what, Mr. Dickinson?

742
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,671
Well, why independence, Mr. Adams?

743
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:08,091
Well, for the obvious reason
that our continued association

744
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,053
with Great Britain has grown intolerable.

745
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,680
Well, to whom, Mr. Adams? To you?

746
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,601
Well, then I suggest
you sever your ties immediately.

747
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:22,898
But please be kind enough
to leave the rest of us where we are.

748
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,692
For myself, I have no objection at all

749
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,487
to being part of the greatest
empire on earth,

750
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,531
to enjoying its protection
and sharing its benefits.

751
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,866
Benefits?

752
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,535
What benefits?

753
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:39,414
Crippling taxes? Cruel repressions?

754
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,124
Abolished rights?

755
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:46,797
Is that all england means to you, sir?

756
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:52,135
Is that all
the pride and affection you can muster

757
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,638
for the nation that bore you?

758
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,475
For the noblest, most civilized nation
on the face of this planet?

759
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:02,187
Well, would you have us forsake
Hastings and magna carta,

760
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,857
strongbow and lionheart,
Drake and marlborough,

761
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,943
tudors, Stuarts and plantagenets?

762
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,653
For what, sir?

763
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,738
Well, tell me. For what?

764
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,243
For you?

765
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,875
Some men are patriots,
like general Washington,

766
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,169
and some are anarchists, like Mr. paine.

767
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:29,005
Some even are internationalists,
like Dr. Franklin.

768
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:31,633
But you, sir...

769
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,012
You are merely an agitator,

770
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,514
disturbing the peace,

771
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,058
creating disorder,
endangering the public welfare.

772
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:41,518
And for what?

773
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,895
Your petty little personal complaints.

774
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,022
Your taxes are too high.

775
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:51,403
Well, sir, so are mine.

776
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,449
Come, come, Mr. Adams.

777
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,453
If you have grievances,
and I'm sure you have,

778
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:04,040
our present system must provide
a gentler means of redressing them

779
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:06,126
short of revolution.

780
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,212
Yes, that's what he wants.

781
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,214
Nothing less will satisfy him.

782
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:14,092
Violence, rebellion, treason.

783
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,638
Now, Mr. Adams,

784
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,976
are these the acts of englishmen?

785
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,604
Not englishmen, Dickinson. Americans.

786
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,647
No, sir. Englishmen!

787
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,400
Please, Mr. Dickinson,
must you start banging?

788
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:31,735
How is a man to sleep?

789
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,781
Forgive me, Dr. Franklin,
but must you start speaking?

790
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:38,992
How is a man to stay awake?

791
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,579
We'll promise to be quiet, sir.

792
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,874
I'm sure everyone prefers
that you remain asleep.

793
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,293
If I'm to hear myself
called an englishman, sir,

794
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,378
I assure you I prefer I'd remained asleep.

795
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:54,257
Now, what's so terrible
about being called an englishman?

796
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:55,884
The English don't seem to mind.

797
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:59,596
Nor would I, were I given the
full rights of an englishman.

798
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,642
But to call me one without those rights
is like calling an ox a bull.

799
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:07,270
He's thankful for the honor, but he'd much
rather have restored what's rightfully his.

800
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:16,696
When did you first notice
they were missing, sir?

801
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:25,205
Fortunately, the people of these colonies

802
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,916
maintain a higher regard
for their mother country.

803
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,795
Higher, certainly, than she feels for them.

804
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:36,091
Never was such a valuable possession
so stupidly and so recklessly managed

805
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:39,094
than this entire continent
by the British crown.

806
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,347
Our industry discouraged,
our resources pillaged.

807
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,393
Worst of all, our very character stifled.

808
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,312
We've spawned a new race here,
Mr. Dickinson.

809
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,730
Rougher, simpler,

810
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:53,441
more violent, more enterprising,

811
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:54,985
less refined.

812
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,362
We're a new nationality.

813
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,572
We require a new nation.

814
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:03,952
Well,

815
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,205
that may be your opinion, Dr. Franklin,

816
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:12,752
but, as I said,
the people feel quite differently.

817
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:16,214
Now, what do you know
about the people, Dickinson?

818
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:19,884
You don't speak for the people.
You represent only yourself.

819
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:22,053
And that precious status quo

820
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,515
you keep imploring the people
to preserve for their own good

821
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:29,728
is nothing more than the eternal
preservation of your own property.

822
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:34,024
Mr. Adams, you have an annoying talent

823
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,192
for making such delightful words

824
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:39,487
as "property" sound quite distasteful.

825
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:42,490
In heaven's name,
what's wrong with property?

826
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,328
Perhaps you've forgotten
that many of us first came to these shores

827
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,039
in order to secure rights to property,

828
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:53,376
and that we hold these rights
no less dear than the rights you speak of.

829
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,922
Yes. So safe, so fat,
so comfortable in Pennsylvania.

830
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,383
And what is this independence of yours

831
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:03,178
except the private grievance
of Massachusetts?

832
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,972
Why is it always Boston
that breaks the king's peace?

833
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:10,435
My dear congress,
you must not adopt this evil measure.

834
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,729
It is the work of the devil.

835
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,148
Leave it where it belongs.

836
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,400
In new england.

837
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:21,154
Brother Dickinson, new england has been
fighting the devil for more than 100 years.

838
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:26,409
And as of now, brother sherman,
the devil has been winning hands down.

839
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:30,413
Why, at this very moment,
he's sitting right here in this congress.

840
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:34,334
Don't let him deceive you.
This proposal is entirely his doing.

841
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,086
It may bear Virginia's name,

842
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:40,090
but it reeks of Adams,
Adams and more Adams.

843
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:45,470
Look at him. Ready to lead this continent
down the fiery path of total destruction.

844
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,682
Good god! Why can't you acknowledge
what already exists?

845
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:53,269
It has been more than a year
since Concord and Lexington.

846
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:55,647
Damn it, man, we're at war, right now!

847
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,983
You may be at war.
You, Boston and John Adams.

848
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,694
But you will never speak for Pennsylvania.

849
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:02,821
Nor for Delaware.

850
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:07,283
Mr. read, you represent
only one-third of Delaware.

851
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,452
The sensible third, Mr. Rodney.

852
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:12,705
Sit down, you scurvy dog,
or I'll knock you down.

853
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,958
Sit down, all three of you!

854
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,043
Mcnair, do something about that damn dog!

855
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:18,628
And here, fetch me a rum.

856
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,797
- Get that dog first!
- Rum, rum!

857
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,674
I only got two hands.

858
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,222
Christ, it's hot!

859
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,653
Please do go on, gentlemen.

860
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,030
You're making the only breeze
in Philadelphia.

861
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,117
Mr. Adams,

862
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,704
perhaps you could
clear up something for me?

863
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,498
After we have achieved independence,

864
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,251
who do you propose
would govern in south Carolina?

865
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,588
The people, of course.

866
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,966
Which people, sir?
The people of south Carolina

867
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,385
or the people of Massachusetts?

868
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,220
Why don't you admit it, neddy?

869
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:12,223
You're against independence now
and you always will be.

870
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,600
Aye.

871
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:19,314
Gentlemen, you refuse to understand us.

872
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,150
We desire independence. Yes.

873
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,820
For south Carolina. That is our country.

874
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,200
And as such,
we don't wish to belong to anyone.

875
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:32,952
Not to england and not to you.

876
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,748
We intend to have one nation, Rutledge.

877
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:40,043
A nation of sovereign states, Mr. Adams.

878
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:45,715
United for our mutual protection,
but separate for our individual pursuits.

879
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,760
Now, that is what
we have understood it to be,

880
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,638
and that is what we will support.

881
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,642
As soon as everyone supports it.

882
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,981
Well, there you are, Mr. Adams.

883
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:05,068
You must see that we need time.

884
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:10,615
Time to make certain who we are and where
we stand in regard to one another.

885
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:14,661
For if we do not determine the nature
of the beast before we set it free,

886
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,413
it will end by consuming us all.

887
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,707
For once in your life, Wilson,

888
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,168
take a chance.

889
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,672
I say the time is now.

890
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,800
It may never come again.

891
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:33,304
Your clock is fast, Mr. Adams.
I say we're not yet ripe for independence.

892
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:36,724
Not ripe? Hell, we're
rotting for want of it.

893
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:41,187
Gentlemen, please,
what in god's name is the infernal hurry?

894
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,273
Why must this question be settled now?

895
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,608
What's wrong with now, Mr. chase?

896
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,069
General Washington is in the field.

897
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:52,282
If he's defeated, as it now appears,
we'll be inviting the hangman.

898
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:56,452
But if, by some miracle,
he should actually win,

899
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:59,247
we can then declare anything
we damn please.

900
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,166
The sentiments of north Carolina precisely.

901
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,003
Has it ever occurred to either of you

902
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:09,549
that an army needs something
to fight for in order to win?

903
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:13,136
A purpose? A goal? A flag of its own?

904
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:14,929
Mr. Adams,

905
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:21,185
how can a nation of only 2 million souls
stand up to an empire of 10 million?

906
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:22,687
Think of it. 10 million.

907
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,106
How do we compensate for that shortage?

908
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,900
It's simple, Mr. chase.
Increase and multiply.

909
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,360
How's that?

910
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:33,489
We will more than compensate with spirit.

911
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,659
I tell you, there is
a spirit out there among the people

912
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,828
that is sadly lacking in this congress.

913
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:41,956
Yes, of course. Now it's spirit.

914
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,042
Well, why didn't I think of that?

915
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:48,254
No army, no Navy, no arms, no ammunition,

916
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:52,634
no treasury, no friends,

917
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,803
but, bless our soul, spirit.

918
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,223
Mr. Lee, Mr. Hopkins,

919
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,726
Mr. Rodney, colonel mckean,

920
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,311
Dr. Franklin.

921
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:08,900
Why have you joined
this incendiary little man,

922
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:11,736
this Boston radical,

923
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,530
this agitator,

924
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,450
this demagogue,

925
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,619
this madman?

926
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,205
Are you calling me a madman, you...

927
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,874
You fribble!

928
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,962
You and your Pennsylvania proprietors,

929
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:33,007
you cool, considerate men,

930
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,259
you hang to the rear on every issue,

931
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:38,721
so that if we should go under,
you'll still remain afloat.

932
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,640
Are you calling me a coward?

933
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,975
Yes. Coward!

934
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:44,727
Madman!

935
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:45,895
Landlord!

936
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,230
Lawyer!

937
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,655
Stop it! Stop it!

938
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,743
This is the congress. Stop it, I say!

939
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,078
The enemy's out there.

940
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,830
No, Mr. Rodney, the enemy is here.

941
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:06,749
No. I say he's out there.

942
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,459
England.

943
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:12,046
England closing in, cutting off our air.

944
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,715
There's no time!

945
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,511
No air.

946
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:21,139
Dr. hall.

947
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:26,728
Colonel mckean.

948
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,604
Aye. It's the cancer.

949
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,607
But he should go home.

950
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,820
A man should die in his own bed.

951
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,699
John. John Adams.

952
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,409
I'm here, Caesar.

953
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,289
I leave you

954
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,666
a divided Delaware.

955
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,294
Forgive me.

956
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:54,088
I'll take you home, Caesar.

957
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:21,115
I'll be back within the week.

958
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:32,126
Mr. president,
south Carolina calls the question.

959
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,379
What's that, Mr. Rutledge?

960
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:38,633
I said, Mr. president,

961
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:42,136
south Carolina desires to end the debate

962
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:46,182
and calls the question of independence.

963
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,476
- Delaware seconds.
- Thank you.

964
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:52,980
Gentlemen, please!

965
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,900
The question has been called and seconded.

966
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,028
The secretary will record the vote.

967
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,447
Franklin, do something. Think.

968
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,533
I'm thinking, but nothing's coming.

969
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:05,743
All those in favor
of the resolution on independence

970
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:08,371
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by saying...

971
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,956
Mr. secretary.

972
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,708
Will you please read the resolution again?

973
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:13,918
What?

974
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,295
I've forgotten it.

975
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:17,964
Now, Benjamin...

976
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,177
"Resolved, that these united colonies are,

977
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:25,888
"and of a right ought to be,
free and independent..."

978
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,857
Excuse me.
Ls this the continental congress?

979
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,526
Yes, I can see that it must be.

980
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,863
It's all right. We found it.

981
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,740
We've been looking
for you everywhere, you see.

982
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:47,451
Someone told us
that you might be at carpenters' hall

983
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:50,162
and someone else suggested library hall,
and...

984
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:51,914
So, finally, we asked a constable...

985
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,082
Excuse me, sir,

986
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:56,252
but, if you don't mind,
the congress is about to decide

987
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,337
the question of American independence.

988
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,841
How splendid. That means
we're not too late.

989
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,176
These gentlemen are Mr. Francis hopkinson,

990
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,014
Mr. Richard stockton,
and I'm the reverend John Witherspoon.

991
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,686
We're the new delegates from New Jersey.

992
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,313
New Jersey?

993
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:20,985
Dr. Franklin,

994
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:25,072
I regret that I must be the bearer
of unhappy tidings, sir,

995
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,950
but your son,
the royal governor of New Jersey,

996
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,952
has been taken prisoner

997
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:34,040
and has been moved under guard to the
colony of Connecticut for safekeeping.

998
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:35,458
Is he unharmed, sir?

999
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,335
When last I heard, he was. Yes, sir.

1000
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:41,130
Well, then why the long face? I hear
Connecticut is an excellent location.

1001
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,300
Tell me.
Why did they arrest the little bastard?

1002
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,678
Our...

1003
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,849
New Jersey legislature has recalled
the old delegation to this congress

1004
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,602
and has sent a new one.

1005
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,813
Quickly, man,
where do you stand on independence?

1006
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:59,607
- Well, haven't I made that clear?
- No.

1007
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,025
Well, I suppose I haven't.

1008
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,944
But that's the reason for the change.

1009
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,404
See, we've been instructed
to vote for independence.

1010
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,822
Mr. president!

1011
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:11,327
Massachusetts is now ready
for the vote on independence,

1012
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:15,831
and reminds the chair of its privilege
to decide all votes that are deadlocked.

1013
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:17,917
I won't forget, Mr. Adams.

1014
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:23,339
The chair takes this opportunity
to welcome the New Jersey delegation

1015
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:26,759
and appoints the reverend Witherspoon
congressional chaplain

1016
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,344
if he will accept the post.

1017
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,388
With much pleasure, sir.

1018
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:37,520
Very well. Mr. thomson, you may
now proceed with the vote on independence.

1019
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:40,690
All in favor
of the resolution on independence

1020
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:43,043
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by saying...

1021
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,110
Mr. president.

1022
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:49,991
Pennsylvania moves
that any vote in favor of independence

1023
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:53,202
must be unanimous.

1024
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:54,912
What?

1025
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:56,706
I second the motion.

1026
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,207
Judge Wilson!

1027
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,959
Oh, my god.

1028
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,253
Delaware seconds, Mr. president.

1029
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,006
No vote has ever had to be unanimous,
Dickinson, and you know it.

1030
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,550
- Yes, but this one must be.
- On what grounds?

1031
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:11,345
That no colony be torn from
its mother country without its own consent.

1032
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,805
Hear! Hear!

1033
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:16,100
But it will never be unanimous, damn it.

1034
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,311
If you say so, Mr. Adams.

1035
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,358
It has been moved and seconded
that the vote on independence

1036
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,736
must be unanimous in order to carry.

1037
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,321
All those in favor, signify by saying yea.

1038
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:30,406
Yea!

1039
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:34,994
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1040
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,371
Six colonies say yea. Against?

1041
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:38,539
Nay!

1042
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:43,002
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1043
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:45,046
Six colonies say nay.

1044
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:50,760
Mr. secretary,
New York abstains courteously.

1045
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:55,264
Mr. Morris,
why does New York constantly abstain?

1046
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:58,267
Why doesn't New York
simply stay in New York?

1047
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,812
Very well. The vote is tied.

1048
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:06,484
The principles of independence
have no greater advocate in congress

1049
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,319
than its president.

1050
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:12,198
That is why I must join those
who vote for unanimity.

1051
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,409
Good god, John!
What are you doing? You've sunk us.

1052
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,203
Now, hear me out.

1053
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,789
Don't you see that any colony
who opposes independence

1054
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:21,683
will be forced to fight
on the side of england?

1055
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,460
That we'll be setting
brother against brother,

1056
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:28,380
that our new nation will carry
as its emblem the mark of Cain.

1057
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:30,841
I can see no other way.

1058
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:35,054
Either we all walk together,
or together we must stay where we are.

1059
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,808
The man's from Massachusetts.

1060
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,102
Very well. Proceed, Mr. thomson.

1061
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,771
A unanimous vote being necessary to carry,

1062
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,357
if any be opposed
to the resolution on independence

1063
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,567
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by...

1064
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:49,652
Mr. president.

1065
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:52,363
For heaven's sake,
let me get through it once.

1066
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,948
Mr. president.

1067
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:56,742
I move for a postponement.

1068
00:58:56,826 --> 00:58:57,993
Postponement?

1069
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,954
I wish you the same luck I had with it.

1070
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,997
Mr. Adams is right. We need a postponement.

1071
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,374
On what grounds?

1072
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,084
On what grounds?

1073
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:09,922
Mr. president, how can this congress vote
onindependence

1074
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:14,885
without a written declaration
of some sort defining it?

1075
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,514
What sort of declaration?

1076
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:24,186
Well, you know,
listing the reasons for the separation,

1077
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,273
our purposes, goals, so forth, so on.

1078
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,733
- Ditto, ditto.
- Ditto, ditto, et cetera, et cetera.

1079
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,318
We know those, don't we?

1080
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:35,781
Yes, good god, we know them,

1081
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,034
but what about the rest of the world?

1082
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:41,537
Certainly we require the assistance

1083
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,207
of a powerful nation
such as France or Spain.

1084
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:49,795
And such a written declaration
would be consistent with European delicacy.

1085
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:54,550
Come now, Mr. Adams.
You'll have to do better than that.

1086
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,553
Answer straight. What would be its purpose?

1087
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,556
Yes. Well...

1088
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:07,521
To place before mankind
the common sense of the subject

1089
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:11,150
in terms so plain and firm

1090
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,861
as to command their assent.

1091
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:24,747
Mr. Jefferson, are you seriously suggesting

1092
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,791
that we publish a paper
declaring to all the world

1093
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:32,171
that an illegal rebellion
is, in reality, a legal one?

1094
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:35,090
Mr. Dickinson, I'm surprised at you.

1095
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,927
You should know that rebellion
is always legal in the first person,

1096
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,720
such as "our rebellion."

1097
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:42,765
It's only in the third person, "their
rebellion," that it is illegal.

1098
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,269
Mr. president, I second the motion

1099
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,104
to postpone the vote on independence

1100
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:53,025
for a period of time sufficient
for the writing of a declaration.

1101
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,361
It has been moved and seconded.
Mr. thomson.

1102
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:58,948
All those in favor of the motion to
postpone, signify by saying yea.

1103
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,532
Yea!

1104
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:04,870
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1105
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:06,914
Six colonies say yea. Against?

1106
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:07,998
Nay!

1107
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:12,336
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1108
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:14,546
Six colonies say nay.

1109
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:20,761
Mr. secretary,
New York abstains courteously.

1110
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:28,852
Mr. Morris, what in hell
goes on in New York?

1111
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:33,399
I'm sorry, Mr. president,
but the simple fact is that

1112
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:37,903
our legislature has never
sent us explicit instructions on anything.

1113
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:40,114
Never?

1114
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,117
That's impossible.

1115
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:49,790
Mr. president, have you ever been present
at a meeting of the New York legislature?

1116
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,626
They speak very fast and very loud,

1117
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,254
and nobody listens to anybody else

1118
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,257
with the result that
nothing ever gets done.

1119
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,928
I beg the congress' pardon.

1120
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,266
My sympathies, Mr. Morris.

1121
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:11,687
The vote again being tied,
the chair decides in favor of postponement.

1122
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,522
So ruled.

1123
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,750
A committee will now be formed
to manage the declaration.

1124
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,736
Said document to be written,
debated, approved by the beginning of July,

1125
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,571
some three weeks hence.

1126
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:25,534
At which time, Virginia's resolution
on independence will finally be voted.

1127
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,119
Is that clear?

1128
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,206
Very well. Will the following gentlemen
serve on the declaration committee,

1129
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,042
- Dr. Franklin?
- Gladly.

1130
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,294
- Mr. John Adams?
- Yes.

1131
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:36,503
Mr. sherman?

1132
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,298
- Mr. Livingston?
- Right.

1133
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,258
And, of course, Mr. Lee.

1134
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,596
Excuse me, but I must be returning
to the sovereign colony of Virginia

1135
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,098
as I have been asked to serve as governor.

1136
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:51,810
And therefore I must
decline respectful-Lee.

1137
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,776
Very well, Mr. Lee, you're excused then.

1138
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:01,362
I suppose we could leave it
a four-man committee.

1139
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,739
Just a moment.
This business needs a virginian.

1140
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,449
Therefore I propose a replacement.

1141
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,326
- Mr. Thomas Jefferson.
- No. Mr. Adams...

1142
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,578
Very well, Mr. Adams.
Mr. Jefferson will serve.

1143
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,331
- L'm going home, too, to my wife.
- Move to adjourn!

1144
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,499
- Wait.
- Lsecond.

1145
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:17,252
Mr. hancock,
i haven't seen her for six months.

1146
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,213
Moved and seconded. Any objections?

1147
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,382
I have objections. I
have lots of objections.

1148
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,675
So ruled! Congress stands adjourned!

1149
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:26,095
John, I need to see my wife.

1150
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:27,805
It's all right. Come along, come along.

1151
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,848
No. I'm going home tonight.

1152
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,517
Of course you are. Of course.

1153
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,478
Mcnair, some rum up to my office.

1154
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:38,023
Don't worry, tom.

1155
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:39,775
Let me handle it.

1156
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,693
I'll get Adams to write it.

1157
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:44,154
I don't know.
He had a funny look on his face.

1158
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,364
He always does.

1159
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,740
All right, gentlemen,

1160
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,409
let's get on with it.

1161
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,495
Which of us will write
our declaration of independence?

1162
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:56,166
<i>Mr. Adams, I say you should write it</i>

1163
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,670
<i>to your legal mind and brilliance we defer</i>

1164
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:03,006
<i>ls that so? Well, if I'm the one to do it</i>

1165
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,967
<i>they'll run their quill pens through it</i>

1166
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,553
<i>I'm obnoxious and disliked
you know that, sir</i>

1167
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:08,637
<i>yes, I know</i>

1168
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,432
<i>but I say you should
write it, Franklin, yes you</i>

1169
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,599
<i>hell no!</i>

1170
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:15,269
<i>Yes, you, Dr. Franklin, you</i>

1171
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,353
<i>- but...
- You!</i>

1172
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:17,479
<i>- But...
- You!</i>

1173
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:19,106
<i>But...</i>

1174
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:24,445
<i>Mr. Adams, but, Mr. Adams</i>

1175
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:28,157
<i>the things I write
are only light extemporanea</i>

1176
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,119
<i>I won't put politics on paper, it's a mania</i>

1177
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:36,039
<i>so I refuse to use the pen in Pennsylvania</i>

1178
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,833
<i>Pennsylvania</i>

1179
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,002
<i>Pennsylvania</i>

1180
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,422
<i>refuse to use the pen</i>

1181
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:58,061
<i>Mr. sherman, I say you should write it</i>

1182
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:00,856
<i>you are never controversial as it were</i>

1183
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:01,982
<i>that is true</i>

1184
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,109
<i>whereas if I'm the one to do it</i>

1185
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:05,903
<i>they'll run their quill pens through it</i>

1186
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:08,363
<i>I'm obnoxious and disliked
you know that, sir</i>

1187
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:09,448
<i>yes, I do</i>

1188
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:12,034
<i>so I say you should write
it, Roger, yes, you</i>

1189
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,368
<i>good heavens, no</i>

1190
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,496
<i>yes, you, Roger sherman</i>

1191
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:16,580
<i>- you!
- But“...</i>

1192
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,664
<i>- You!
- But“...</i>

1193
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:20,167
<i>- You!
- But“...</i>

1194
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:25,130
<i>Mr. Adams, but, Mr. Adams</i>

1195
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:29,009
<i>I cannot write
with any style or proper etiquette</i>

1196
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:32,554
<i>I don't know a participle from a predicate</i>

1197
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:35,641
<i>I am just a simple cobbler from Connecticut</i>

1198
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:38,352
<i>Connecticut</i>

1199
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,062
<i>Connecticut</i>

1200
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:43,899
<i>a simple cobbler, he</i>

1201
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,996
<i>Mr. Livingston, maybe you should write it</i>

1202
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,707
<i>you have many friends and you're a diplomat</i>

1203
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,792
<i>oh, that word</i>

1204
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,794
<i>whereas if I'm the one to do it</i>

1205
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,462

1207
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,091
<i>I hadn't heard</i>

1208
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:11,718

1209
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:12,886
<i>not me, Johnny</i>

1210
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,097
<i>yes, you, Robert Livingston</i>

1211
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,181

<i>Mr. Adams, dear Mr. Adams</i>

1215
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:28,944
<i>I've been presented
with a new son by the noble stork</i>

1216
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,489

1217
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:36,493

<i>Livingston's going to pop a cork</i>

01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:58,932
<i>Mr. Adams</i>

<i>leave me alone</i>

1223
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:06,648
- Mr. Jefferson...
- Mr. Adams, I beg of you.

1224
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:10,193
I've not seen my wife
these past six months.

1225
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:13,780
"And we solemnly declare
that we will preserve our liberties,

1226
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:18,702
"being with one mind resolved to die
free men rather than to live slaves."

1227
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:23,749
Thomas Jefferson,
"on the necessity of taking up arms," 1775.

1228
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,000
Magnificent.

1229
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:28,837
You write 10 times better
than any man in congress,

1230
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,631
including me.

1231
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,799
For a man of only 33 years,

1232
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:36,470
you possess a happy talent for composition

1233
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,431
and a remarkable Felicity of expression.

1234
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:43,352
Now, then, sir. Will you be a patriot

1235
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:44,770
or a lover?

1236
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,731
A lover.

1237
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,025
No.

1238
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,152
But I burn, Mr. a.

1239
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,404
So do I, Mr. j.

1240
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,907
- You?
- You do?

1241
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,492
- John.
- Who'd have thought it?

1242
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:02,537
<i>Mr. Jefferson</i>

1243
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,956

1247
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:23,928

Quiet!

1252
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:36,613
Now, you'll write it, Mr. j.

1253
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:39,157
Who will make me, Mr. a.?

1254
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:41,076

1255
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,078

1256
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:44,830
Yes.

1257
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,001
How?

1258
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,673
By physical force, if necessary.

1259
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:58,343
It's your duty, damn it. Your duty!

<i>Mr. Adams</i>

1261
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,225

01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,219
The decision is yours, Mr. Jefferson.

1272
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:43,221
Do as you like with it.

1273
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:53,857
<i>We may see murder yet</i>

1274
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:04,326

1275
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,914
God damn the man.

1276
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:58,004
Sorry.

1277
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:03,593
- Pardon me, sir.
- Step aside. Step aside.

1278
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,304
- How are you?
- Franklin.

1279
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,271
Jefferson!

1280
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,817
Jefferson!

1281
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,571
What is that racket?

1282
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,739
Latest thing from Europe, John.
It's called music.

1283
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:28,285
I came here
hoping to hear a pen scratching, not a bow.

1284
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:33,081
Jefferson! I know you're in there!

1285
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,377
Jefferson, are you finished?

1286
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,339
Well, is it written yet?

1287
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,761
Well, you've had a whole week, man.

1288
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,221
Is it done?

1289
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,433
Can I see it?

1290
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:01,544
"There comes a time in the lives of men
when it becomes necessary

1291
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,779
"to advance from that subordination
in which they have hitherto..."

1292
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,531
This is terrible.

1293
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:08,199
Where's the rest of it?

1294
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,876
Do you mean to say
that it is not yet finished?

1295
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:19,961
No, sir.

1296
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,672
I mean to say that it's not yet begun.

1297
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:24,925
Good god!

1298
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,719
A whole week.

1299
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,890
The entire earth was created in a week.

1300
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,105
Someday you must tell me how you did it.

1301
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,902
Disgusting.

1302
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,404
Look at him, Franklin.

1303
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,698
Virginia's most famous lover.

1304
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:51,284
Virginia abstains.

1305
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,123
Well, cheer up, Jefferson.

1306
01:12:57,207 --> 01:12:59,185
Get out of the clumps.
It'll come out all right, I assure you.

1307
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,586
Now, get back to work.

1308
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:04,965
Franklin, tell him to get back to work.

1309
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,800
I think he's asleep.

1310
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,554
Wake up, Franklin!

1311
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,104
Hello! And whose little girl are you?

1312
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,693
John, who is she?

1313
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:26,194
His wife.

1314
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,446
Ihope.

1315
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,658
What makes you think so?

1316
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,618
Because I sent for her.

1317
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:35,787
You what?

1318
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,474
Well, it simply occurred to me
that the sooner his problem was solved,

1319
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:40,542
the sooner our problem is solved.

1320
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,378
That's good thinking, John. Good thinking.

1321
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,464
Madam, may I present myself? John Adams.

1322
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:50,635
Adams.

1323
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,680
John Adams.

1324
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:57,142
And Dr. Franklin.

1325
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,563
The inventor of the stove.

1326
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:08,987
Jefferson, kindly present me to your wife.

1327
01:14:11,865 --> 01:14:13,867
She is your wife, isn't she?

1328
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,870
Well, of course she is.
Look at the way they fit.

1329
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:20,331
Come along, John, come along.

1330
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:23,084
- Franklin, where are you going?
- Come along, John.

1331
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,503
Come along where? There's work to be done.

1332
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:26,921
Obviously.

1333
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,717
Good god. You don't mean to say that...

1334
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,262
I mean, they're not going to...

1335
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:37,682
In the middle of the afternoon?

1336
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:40,185
Not everybody's from Boston, John.

1337
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,104
Incredible.

1338
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:44,939
Well, goodbye, John.

1339
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:47,358
Franklin?

1340
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,278
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet, but...

1341
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,361
I understand
the Turkey's fresh at bunch of grapes.

1342
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,450
Well, the fact is I have
a rendezvous, John.

1343
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:58,703
I'd ask you along,
but talking makes her nervous.

1344
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:02,957
Yes, of course.

1345
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:24,229
Incredible.

1346
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,488
Abigail?

1347
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:36,825
I'm very lonely, Abigail.

1348
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:38,952
<i>Are you, John?</i>

1349
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:42,497
<i>As long as you were sending for wives,
why didn't you send for your own?</i>

1350
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,500
Now, don't be unreasonable, Abigail.

1351
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,418
<i>Now I'm unreasonable.</i>

1352
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:50,088
<i>You must add that to your list.</i>

1353
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:52,674
List?

1354
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,927
The catalog of my faults
you included in your last letter.

1355
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:01,141
They were fondly intended, madam.

1356
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,851
That I play at cards badly?

1357
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:04,352
A compliment.

1358
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,229
That my posture is crooked?

1359
01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:08,857
An endearment.

1360
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,817
That I read, write and think too much?

1361
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,944
An irony.

1362
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,404
That I'm pigeon-toed?

1363
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,492
Well, now there you have me, Abby.

1364
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,996
I'm afraid you are pigeon-toed.

1365
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:29,335
Please. Come to Philadelphia. Please come.

1366
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:32,005
Thank you, John.

1367
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,549
I do want to,
but you know now it's not possible.

1368
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,832
The children have the measles.

1369
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,052
So you wrote.

1370
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,222
Tom and little Abby.

1371
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:44,142
Only now it's Quincy and Charles.

1372
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:49,814
And it appears the farm here
in braintree is failing, John.

1373
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,943
The chickens and the geese have all died.

1374
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:57,447
The apples never survived the late frost.

1375
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:02,035
How do you suppose
she managed to get away?

1376
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:05,872
Well, the winters are softer in Virginia.

1377
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:08,333
And their women, John?

1378
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,835
Fit for virginians, madam,

1379
01:17:10,919 --> 01:17:14,255
but pale, puny things
beside new england girls.

1380
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:16,049
John.

1381
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,636
I thank you for that.

1382
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:26,184
Abigail, how goes it with you?

1383
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:28,978
Not well, John. Not at all well.

1384
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:33,900
<i>I live like a nun in a cloister</i>

1385
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:38,112
<i>solitary, celibate i hate it</i>

1386
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:39,948
and you, John?

1387
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:44,160
<i>I live like a monk in an Abbey</i>

1388
01:17:44,244 --> 01:17:46,663
<i>ditto, ditto i hate it</i>

1389
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:55,004
<i>write to me with sentimental effusion</i>

1390
01:17:56,047 --> 01:18:02,720
<i>let me revel in romantic illusion</i>

1391
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:11,437
<i>do you still smell of
vanilla and spring air?</i>

1392
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:16,943
<i>And is my favorite lover's pillow</i>

1393
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,405
<i>still firm and fair?</i>

1394
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:26,995
<i>What was there, John</i>

1395
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:33,710
<i>still is there, John</i>

1396
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:39,007
<i>come soon as you can to my cloister</i>

1397
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:43,469
<i>I've forgotten the feel of your hand</i>

1398
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:48,641
<i>soon, madam, we shall walk
in cupid's grove together</i>

1399
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:55,064
<i>- and we'll fondly survey
- and we'll fondly survey</i>

1400
01:18:55,148 --> 01:19:01,529

01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:06,951
<i>- till then, till then

1402
01:19:07,035 --> 01:19:12,623
<i>- I am as I ever was
- I am as I ever was</i>

1403
01:19:12,707 --> 01:19:17,211
<i>- and ever shall be

1404
01:19:17,295 --> 01:19:19,714

01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:38,191
<i>John</i>

1411
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,660
John?

1412
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:50,745
John!

1413
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:51,913
What?

1414
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,015
What are you doing down here?

1415
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,999
I thought you'd be up there,
cracking the whip.

1416
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:58,378
Well, the shutters are still closed.

1417
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,506
My word! So they are.

1418
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,009
Well, as the French say...

1419
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:07,136
Please, Franklin!

1420
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,556
Spare me your bawdy mind
first thing in the morning.

1421
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:12,850
Dare we call?

1422
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:15,269
A congressman dares anything.

1423
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:17,188
- Go ahead.
- Me?

1424
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,399
Your voice is more piercing.

1425
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:24,362
John, look at her. Just look at her.

1426
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:25,655
Lam.

1427
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,658
She's even more magnificent
than I remember.

1428
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,870
Of course, we didn't see
much of her front last night.

1429
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:34,205
Good morrow, madam.

1430
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,706
Good morrow.

1431
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:42,171
Is it the habit in Philadelphia for strangers
to shout at ladies from the street?

1432
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:43,464
Not really, but...

1433
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:48,010
And for men of your age
it is not only unseemly, it is unsightly.

1434
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:52,432
Excuse me, madam, but we met last evening.

1435
01:20:53,558 --> 01:20:55,226
I spoke to no one last evening.

1436
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:56,561
Indeed, you did not.

1437
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,313
Nonetheless, we did present ourselves.

1438
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,358
This is Mr. John Adams.
I'm Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

1439
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,194
The inventor of the stove.

1440
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,575
Please! I know your names very well, but...

1441
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,077
Well, you said
you presented yourselves last night?

1442
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:15,913
It's of no matter.
Your thoughts were well-taken elsewhere.

1443
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,918
My husband is not yet up.

1444
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:23,421
Well, then shall we start over again?
Won't you join us?

1445
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:26,007
Yes, of course.

1446
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:29,778
Well, no wonder the man couldn't write.

1447
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,762
Who would think
of independence married to her?

1448
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:34,098
- I feel an absolute fool.
- That's good for you, John.

1449
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:36,100
I tell you, Franklin,
it's positively indecent.

1450
01:21:36,184 --> 01:21:39,854
- John, they're young and they're in love.
- Not them, Franklin. Us.

1451
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:43,107
Standing down here, waiting for them to...

1452
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:46,152
Well, what will people think?

1453
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,530
Don't worry, John.
The history books will clean it up.

1454
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:50,781
Well, it doesn't matter.

1455
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:54,535
I'll not appear in the history
books anyway. Only you.

1456
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:59,457
Franklin did this and Franklin did that,
and Franklin did some other damned thing.

1457
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:02,710
Franklin smote the ground and out sprang

1458
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:04,504
George Washington,

1459
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,923
fully grown and on his horse.

1460
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:10,426
Franklin then electrified him
with his miraculous lightning rod

1461
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:14,138
then the three of them,
Franklin, Washington and the horse,

1462
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:17,433
conducted the entire revolution
all by themselves.

1463
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:21,896
I like it.

1464
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,150
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.

1465
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:31,322
It is indeed an honor
to meet the two greatest men in America.

1466
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:33,699
Certainly the greatest
within earshot anyway.

1467
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:35,660
I'm not an idle flatterer, Dr. Franklin.

1468
01:22:35,743 --> 01:22:37,954
My husband admires you both greatly.

1469
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:39,664
Then we are doubly flattered,

1470
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:43,125
for we admire very much
that what your husband admires.

1471
01:22:48,256 --> 01:22:49,840
Did you sleep well, madam?

1472
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:54,595
Well, I mean, did you lie...

1473
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,242
Damn it, you know what I mean.

1474
01:22:58,266 --> 01:22:59,576
Yes, John, we know what you mean.

1475
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,270
Tell us about yourself.
We've heard precious little.

1476
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:04,355
- What's your first name?
- Martha.

1477
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:05,648
Martha!

1478
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:08,693
He might at least have told us that.

1479
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,319
Your husband doesn't say very much.

1480
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:11,904
Most silent man in congress.

1481
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:13,924
I have never heard him
utter three sentences together.

1482
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,533
Not every man's a talker, John.

1483
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:19,829
Yes, it's true, you know.
Tom is not a talker.

1484
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:26,168
<i>Oh, he never speaks his passions</i>

1485
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:29,297
<i>he never speaks his views</i>

1486
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:32,883
<i>whereas other men speak volumes</i>

1487
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:37,471
<i>the man I love is mute</i>

1488
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:40,141
<i>in truth I can't recall</i>

1489
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:43,436
<i>being wooed with words</i>

1490
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,813
<i>at all</i>

1491
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,734
<i>even now</i>

1492
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:51,319
don't stop, madam.

1493
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,112
No. Tell us, how did he win you?

1494
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:56,365
And how does he hold on
to a bounty such as you?

1495
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:59,285
Well, surely you've noticed
that tom is a man of many accomplishments.

1496
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,369
Of course.

1497
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:03,623
Author, lawyer, statesman,
architect, farmer.

1498
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:09,003
And still one more that
I hesitate to mention.

1499
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,297
Don't hesitate, madam. Don't hesitate.

1500
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:14,842
No, tell us.
What else can that redheaded tombstone do?

1501
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:22,224
<i>He plays the violin</i>

1502
01:24:22,308 --> 01:24:26,562
<i>he tucks it right under his chin</i>

1503
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:28,773
<i>and he bows</i>

1504
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:30,983
<i>oh, he bows</i>

1505
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:34,987
<i>for he knows yes, he knows</i>

1506
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:39,200
<i>that it's hi-hi-hi-diddle diddle</i>

1507
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:42,870
<i>'twixt my heart, tom and his fiddle</i>

1508
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:46,957
<i>my strings are unstrung</i>

1509
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:49,669
<i>h i-hi-hi</i>

1510
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:53,089
<i>hi</i>

1511
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:56,217
<i>I am undone</i>

1512
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,593
the violin, madam?

1513
01:24:57,677 --> 01:25:01,222
<i>I hear his violin</i>

1514
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:04,850
<i>and I get that feeling within</i>

1515
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:08,479
<i>and I sigh oh, I sigh</i>

1516
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:12,066
<i>he draws near, very near</i>

1517
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:16,278
<i>and it's hi-hi-hi-diddle diddle</i>

1518
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:19,949
<i>and goodbye to the fiddle</i>

1519
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:24,036
<i>my strings are unstrung</i>

1520
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,747
<i>h i-hi-hi</i>

1521
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:30,084
<i>hi</i>

1522
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,294
<i>I'm always undone</i>

1523
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:34,338
that settles it, John.
We're taking up the violin.

1524
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:37,435
Very well, madam. You have us
playing the violin. What happens next?

1525
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:38,592
Next, Mr. Adams?

1526
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:40,136
Yes. What does tom do now?

1527
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:41,804
Why, just what you'd expect.

1528
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,683
We dance.

1529
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:47,476
Dance?

1530
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,770
Dance? Incredible!

1531
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:52,898
One, two, three. One, two, three!

1532
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,405
Who's playing the violin?

1533
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:01,115
John, really?

1534
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,570
John, you can dance.

1535
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:42,656
We still do a few things
in Boston, Franklin.

1536
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:59,799
<i>H i-hi-hi</i>

1537
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:02,843
<i>hi</i>

1538
01:27:02,927 --> 01:27:04,428
<i>Hi</i>

1539
01:27:04,512 --> 01:27:08,516
<i>When heaven calls to me</i>

1540
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:11,769
<i>sing me no sad elegy</i>

01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:13,395
<i>say I died</i>

1542
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:15,523
<i>loving bride</i>

1543
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:18,776
<i>loving wife, loving life</i>

1544
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,863
<i>for it was hi-hi-hi-diddle diddle</i>

1545
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:26,700
<i>'twixt my heart, tom and his fiddle</i>

1546
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:31,247

<i>he plays the violin</i>

1553
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:06,073
look! Look, Franklin, he's done it.
He's written it.

1554
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:10,828
"Dear Mr. Adams,
i am taking my wife back to bed.

1555
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:13,914
"Kindly go away.
Your obedient, t. Jefferson."

1556
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:16,709
Incredible!

1557
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:21,005
You know, perhaps I should have
written the declaration after all.

1558
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:25,217
At my age, there's little doubt
the pen is mightier than the sword.

Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia's absent,

01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,734
and north Carolina,
south Carolina and Georgia.

1571
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:27,029
And what follows
is a complete and up-to-date list

1572
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,406
of all the committees of this congress,

1573
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:33,410
now sitting, about to
sit orjust having sat.

1574
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:37,164
"A committee formed
to investigate a complaint made against

"the quality of yeast
manufactured by Mr. Henry Pendleton's mill

"A committee formed to..."

1586
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:12,783
Where is that committee?

1587
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,786
What do you think of it, doctor? Democracy?

1588
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:19,957
What Plato called
"a charming form of government

1589
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,334
"full of variety and disorder."

1590
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,587
I never knew Plato had
been to Philadelphia.

1591
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:29,591
Ben, I want you to see some cards
I've gone and had printed up.

1592
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:31,844
Ought to save everybody here
a lot of time and effort,

1593
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:36,890
considering the epidemic of bad disposition
that's been going on around here lately

1594
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:40,060
"dear sir, you are, without
any doubt, a rogue, a rascal,

1595

no-good son-of-a-bitch."

1598
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:48,831
And you sign your name. What do you think?

1599
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,738
I'll take a dozen right now.

1600
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,489
Here it is.

1601
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:55,576
"A committee formed
to answer all congressional correspondence,

1602
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:59,329
"designated as the
congressional correspondence committee."

1603
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:03,584
All right, Franklin, enough socializing.
There's work to be done.

1604
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,252
- Good morning, John.
- What?

1605
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:07,713
- Good morning.
- Good morning, good morning.

1606
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,757
- Now then, let's get to it.
- Get to what?

1607
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,842
Unanimity, of course. Look at that board.

1608
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:14,178
Six nays to win over
in little more than a week.

1609
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:17,097
"A committee formed to consider
the problem of counterfeit money

"designated as the
counterfeit money committee."

1611
01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:21,643
- Oh, god! What...
- All right, John, all right.

1612
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:24,104
- Where shall we start?
- Well, what about Delaware?

1613
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:27,316
Sad thing to see them
on the wrong side after all this time.

1614
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,276
- Any news of Rodney?
- Yes. Mckean's back.

1615
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:30,360
Thomas!

1616
01:31:30,444 --> 01:31:34,406
"A committee formed to study the causes
of our military defeat in Canada."

1617
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:38,619
Thomas, how did you leave Caesar?
Ls he still alive?

1618
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:42,706
Aye, but the journey to Dover
was fearful hard on him.

1619
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:46,418
He never complained, but I could see
the poor man was suffering terrible.

1620
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:48,462
But you got him safely home.

1621
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:52,257
I did, but I doubt
he'll ever set foot out of it again.

1622
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:54,861
That leaves you and read
split down the middle. Will he come over?

1623
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:57,679
I don't know. He's a stubborn ignoramus.

1624
01:31:57,763 --> 01:31:59,763
Work on him.
Keep after him till you wear him down.

1625
01:31:59,807 --> 01:32:03,393
Look, John, face facts, will you?
If it were just read standing in our way,

1626
01:32:03,477 --> 01:32:05,938
it wouldn't be so bad,
but look for yourself, man.

1627
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:09,983
Maryland, Pennsylvania
and the entire south. It's impossible!

1628
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:13,237
Well, it's impossible if we all
stand around complaining about it.

1629
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,156
To work, mckean!
One foot in front of the other!

1630
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,520
I believe I put it a better way.

1631
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:20,661
- Never leave off until tomorrow...
- Shut up, Franklin.

1632
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:23,163
But what good will it do?

1633
01:32:23,247 --> 01:32:26,250
You know Dickinson. He'll never give in.

1634
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,710
And you haven't heard
the last of Rutledge either.

1635
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:30,921
Never mind about them.
Yourjob is George read.

1636
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:33,757
Talk him deaf if you have to,
but bring us back Delaware.

1637
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:36,051
- There's a simpler way.
- What?

1638
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,095
This'll break the tie.

1639
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:40,139
All right, John, who's next?

1640
01:32:40,222 --> 01:32:42,182
"A committee formed to keep secrets

1641
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:44,685
"designated as the secrets committee."

1642
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:46,270
Pennsylvania and Maryland.

1643
01:32:46,353 --> 01:32:48,689
Now, I suggest you try
to get your own house into order

1644
01:32:48,772 --> 01:32:51,066
and I'll take a crack at old vacant-face.

1645
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:53,235
Lord, look at him stuff himself.

1646
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:55,988
Mr. chase!

1647
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:59,324
How about it, chase?
When are you coming to your senses, man?

1648
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:02,494
Please, Mr. Adams, not while I'm eating.

1649
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:04,163
Mr. Wilson, sir?

1650
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,999
It's time to assert yourself.

1651
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,042
Tell me something. When you were a judge,

1652
01:33:09,126 --> 01:33:12,004
how in hell did you ever make a decision?

1653
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:16,800
The decisions I made
were all based on legality and precedence.

1654
01:33:16,884 --> 01:33:20,971
But there is no legality here
and certainly no precedent.

1655
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:25,767
Because it's a new idea, you clot!

1656
01:33:25,851 --> 01:33:28,395
We'll be setting our own precedent!

1657
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:32,441
No, Mr. mckean. No, no, no!

1658
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:36,028
Damn your eyes, read!
You come into this world screaming "no,"

1659
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:40,115
and you're determined
to leave it the same way, you slimy worm!

1660
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:44,536
The congress is waiting on you, chase!

1661
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:48,332
America is waiting!
The whole world is waiting!

1662
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:50,375
What's that? Kidney?

1663
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:53,045
Leave me alone, Mr. Adams!

1664
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,671
You're wasting your time.

1665
01:33:54,755 --> 01:33:56,548
If I thought we could win this war,

1666
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:58,175
I'd be at the front of your ranks.

1667
01:33:58,258 --> 01:34:01,136
But you must know it's impossible.

1668
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:03,430
You've heard
general Washington's dispatches.

1669
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:05,557
His army has fallen to pieces.

1670
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:08,393
Washington is exaggerating the situation

1671
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:11,021
in order to arouse
this torpid congress into action.

1672
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:12,648
Why, as chairman of the war committee,

1673
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:16,526
I can state for a fact that the army
has never been in better shape.

1674
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:19,279
Never have troops been more cheerful.

1675
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:21,531
Never have soldiers been more resolute.

1676
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:25,327
Never have training
and discipline been more spirited.

1677
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,204
Oh, good god.

1678
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:39,800
May we have your ears, gentlemen?
Mr. thomson has a dispatch.

1679

That man would depress a hyena.

1706
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:08,972
Well, Mr. Adams,
you're chairman of the war committee.

1707
01:36:09,056 --> 01:36:13,310
Do you feel up to whoring,
drinking, deserting and new brunswick?

1708
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:17,981
There must be some mistake.
I have an aunt who lives in new brunswick.

1709
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:22,861
You must tell her to keep up the good work.

1710
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,741
Come, come, Mr. Adams.

1711
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,077
You must see that it's hopeless.

1712
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,037
Let us recall general Washington

1713
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:35,999
and disband the continental army
before we're overwhelmed.

1714
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:39,252
Yes, indeed. The English would like that,
now, wouldn't they?

1715
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:43,048
Why not ask them yourself?
They ought to be here any minute.

1716
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:46,176
And when they hang you, Mr. Adams,

1717
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:49,221
I hope you will put in a good word
for the rest of us.

1718
01:36:58,105 --> 01:36:59,981
Face facts, Mr. Adams.

1719
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:05,487
A handful of drunk and disorderly recruits
against the entire British army,

1720
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:08,949
the finest musket men on earth.

1721
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:10,784
How can we win?

1722
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:13,412
How can we even hope to survive?

1723
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:15,122
Answer me straight, chase.

1724
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:18,792
If you thought we could beat the redcoats,

1725
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,294
would Maryland say yea to independence?

1726
01:37:21,378 --> 01:37:23,255
Well, lsuppose“.

1727
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:24,506
No supposing.

1728
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,050
Would you or wouldn't you?

1729
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:31,346
Very well, Mr. Adams.

1730
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,474
Yes, we would.

1731
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:37,644
Then come with me
to new brunswick and see for yourself.

1732
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:38,728
John, are you mad?

1733
01:37:38,812 --> 01:37:40,415
You heard what Washington said.
It's a shambles.

1734
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,023
They're pushing you into it, Johnny!

1735
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:43,191
What do you say, chase?

1736
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:45,986
Go ahead, Sam.
It sounds lively as hell up there.

1737
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:48,071
All right. Why not?

1738
01:37:48,155 --> 01:37:51,158
And maybe it'll be John Adams
who comes to his senses.

1739
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:54,369
Mr. president, the war committee
will heed general Washington's request.

1740
01:37:54,453 --> 01:37:57,831
A party consisting of Mr. chase, Dr.
Franklin and myself will leave immediately.

1741
01:37:57,914 --> 01:37:59,249
Is that...

1742
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:03,003
Ls that satisfactory with you, Dr.
Franklin?

1743
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:05,755
Wake up, Franklin!
You're going to new brunswick.

1744
01:38:05,839 --> 01:38:07,299
Like hell I am. What for?

1745
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,593
The whoring and the drinking.

1746
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:14,055
All right, chase!
Move all that lard. Not a moment to lose.

1747
01:38:14,139 --> 01:38:17,767
Left, right, left, right.
Left, right, left, right.

1748
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:19,519
Lefi, flghllefi!

1749
01:38:30,614 --> 01:38:34,493
Mr. mcnair, all this talk of independence

1750
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:37,287
has left a certain foulness in the air.

1751
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:41,291
My friends and I would appreciate it
if you could open some windows.

1752
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:43,543
Well, what about the flies?

1753
01:38:43,627 --> 01:38:45,629
The windows, Mr. mcnair.

1754
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:50,884
Open the windows, close the windows.

1755
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,969
Sweet Jesus!

1756
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:06,149
<i>Oh, say, do you see what I see?</i>

1757
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:10,028
<i>Congress sitting here in sweet Serenity</i>

1758
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:13,406

1820
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:45,076
<i>We're cool, cool men</i>

1821
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:51,374
Mr. hancock,
you're a man of property, one of us.

1822
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:54,377
Why don't you join us in our minuet?

1823
01:42:54,461 --> 01:42:57,130
Why do you persist
in dancing with John Adams?

1824
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:59,174
Good lord, sir, you don't even like him.

1825
01:42:59,716 --> 01:43:03,011
<i>That is true. He annoys me quite a lot</i>

1826
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:06,431
<i>but still I'd rather trot
to Mr. Adams' new gavotte</i>

1827
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:10,226
why? For personal glory?
For a place in history?

1828
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:13,855
Be careful, sir. History will brand him
and his followers as traitors.

1829
01:43:14,147 --> 01:43:16,816
Traitors, Mr. Dickinson? To what?

1830
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:20,403
The British crown or the
British half crown?

1831
01:43:20,487 --> 01:43:24,324
Fortunately, there are not enough men
of property in America to dictate policy.

1832
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:27,994
Perhaps not, but don't forget
that most men with nothing

1833
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:31,331
would rather protect the possibility
of becoming rich

1834
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:33,958
than face the reality of being poor.

1835
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:38,755
And that is why they will follow us...

1836
01:43:38,838 --> 01:43:42,675
<i>To the right, ever to the right</i>

1837
01:43:42,759 --> 01:43:46,429

how'd you like to try and borrow
a dollar from one of them?

1858
01:45:15,143 --> 01:45:17,270
You want some more rum, general?

1859
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:18,605
General?

1860
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:21,566
Lord, I ain't even a corporal.

1861
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:24,027
Yeah, well, what's the army know?

1862
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:29,032
Here, son. There you go.

1863
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:37,874
Sit down, gentlemen.
The chair rules it's too damn hot to work.

1864
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:50,845
Well, general, what's it like out there?

1865
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:53,348
You probably know more than me.

1866
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:54,724
Sitting here?

1867
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:58,770
Sweet Jesus, this is the last place
to find out what's going on.

1868
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:01,314
I'm aiming to join up.

1869
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:04,484
What are you talking about?
You don't have to join up.

1870
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:05,610
You're in congress.

1871
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:06,986
What's that got to do with it?

1872
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:10,198
Well, you don't see them
rushing off to get killed, do you?

1873
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:13,159
They sure are great ones for sending
others, i can tell you that.

1874
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,536
Hey, who sits here?

1875
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:18,081
Caesar Rodney of Delaware.

1876
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:19,874
Where are you from, general?

1877
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:21,834
Wate rtown.

1878
01:46:21,918 --> 01:46:23,836
Now where's that?

1879
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,088
Massachusetts.

1880
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:27,382
Well, then you belong over there.

1881
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:34,722
But be careful.

1882
01:46:35,098 --> 01:46:38,601
There's something about that chair
that makes a man awful noisy.

1883
01:46:42,939 --> 01:46:44,774
You seen any fighting?

1884
01:46:46,109 --> 01:46:47,360
Sure did.

1885
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:52,407
I see'd my two best friends get shot dead
on the very same day.

1886
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:55,743
And at Lexington it was, too.

1887
01:46:55,827 --> 01:46:57,954
Right on the village green.

1888
01:46:58,663 --> 01:46:59,932
When they didn't come home for supper,

1889
01:46:59,956 --> 01:47:02,959
their mamas went down the hill
looking for them.

1890
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:05,336
Mrs. lowell, she found Timothy.

1891
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:08,965
Right off.

1892
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:13,970
But Mrs. pickett...

1893
01:47:16,806 --> 01:47:19,684
She looked near half the night for William.

1894
01:47:20,852 --> 01:47:23,271
He went and crawled off the green

1895
01:47:24,397 --> 01:47:25,940
before he died.

1896
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:38,202
<i>Mama, hey, mama</i>

1897
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:43,332
<i>come looking for me</i>

1898
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:47,920

<i>them soldiers, they fired</i>

1906
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:23,164
<i>oh, ma, did we run</i>

1907
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:27,960
<i>but then we turned round</i>

1908
01:48:28,044 --> 01:48:32,381
<i>and the battle begun</i>

1909
01:48:33,549 --> 01:48:37,178
<i>then I went under</i>

1910
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:41,390
<i>oh, ma, am I done?</i>

1911
01:48:42,809 --> 01:48:46,354
<i>Hey, hey</i>

1912
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:52,235
<i>mama, look sharp</i>

1913
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:58,908

01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:02,995
<i>my face to the sky</i>

01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:07,625
<i>is that you I'm hearing</i>

1916
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:11,629

1917
01:49:12,505 --> 01:49:16,008
<i>mama, come find me</i>

1918
01:49:16,092 --> 01:49:19,804

01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:59,552

<i>look sharp</i>

1935
01:50:45,556 --> 01:50:49,268
the secretary will now read the report
of the declaration committee.

1936
01:50:49,352 --> 01:50:50,853
Mr. thomson.

1937
01:50:50,937 --> 01:50:52,772
"A declaration by the representatives

1938
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:56,817
"of the United States of America,
in general congress assembled.

01:50:59,237 --> 01:51:02,490
"it becomes necessary for one people

"that to secure these rights..."

1952
01:51:35,064 --> 01:51:39,151
Jefferson! We're back,
and we've got Maryland.

1953
01:51:39,235 --> 01:51:42,089
That is, we will, as soon as chase
gets through telling the Maryland assembly

1954
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:44,073
what we saw in new brunswick.

1955
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:45,741
He's in Annapolis right now,

1956
01:51:45,825 --> 01:51:49,495
describing a ragtag collection
of provincial militiamen

1957
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:52,581
who couldn't drill together,
train together or march together.

1958
01:51:52,665 --> 01:51:54,625
But when a flock of ducks flew over

1959
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:57,753
and they saw their first meal
in three full days,

1960
01:51:57,837 --> 01:51:59,839
sweet Jesus, could they shoot together!

1961
01:51:59,922 --> 01:52:02,508
- It was a slaughter.
- A slaughter.

1962
01:52:02,591 --> 01:52:04,218
They're reading the declaration.

1963
01:52:04,302 --> 01:52:06,762
Good god! How far have they gotten?

1964
01:52:07,096 --> 01:52:08,723
"To render the military independent of

1965
01:52:08,806 --> 01:52:10,599

"independent of and superior to..."

1967
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:20,985
Nothing to fear.

1968
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:22,236
It's a masterpiece.

1969
01:52:22,903 --> 01:52:24,864
I'm to be congratulated.

1970
01:52:25,448 --> 01:52:26,532
<i>You'?</i>

1971
01:52:27,742 --> 01:52:29,327
For making him write it.

1972
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:30,619
Of course.

1973
01:52:32,204 --> 01:52:34,957
<i>It's a masterpiece, I say</i>

1974
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:39,045

01:52:39,128 --> 01:52:42,214
<i>I wish I felt that way</i>

01:52:42,298 --> 01:52:45,634
<i>I believe I can put it better</i>

<i>playing midwives to an egg</i>

1986
01:53:17,792 --> 01:53:19,001
egg? What egg?

1987
01:53:19,085 --> 01:53:21,128
America. The birth of a new nation.

1988
01:53:21,212 --> 01:53:24,465
If only we could be sure
of what kind of a bird it's going to be.

1989
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:27,093
Tom has a point.
What sort of bird shall we choose

1990
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:29,303
as the symbol of our new America?

1991
01:53:29,387 --> 01:53:31,347
The eagle.

1992
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:32,848
The dove.

1993
01:53:32,932 --> 01:53:34,308
The Turkey.

1994
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:37,019
The eagle.

1995
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,231
- The dove.
- The eagle!

1996
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:43,526
- The eagle.
- The Turkey.

1997
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,904
The eagle is a majestic bird.

1998
01:53:46,987 --> 01:53:49,740
The eagle is a scavenger,
a thief and a coward.

1999
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:53,411
A symbol of over 10 centuries
of European mischief.

2000
01:53:53,494 --> 01:53:54,787
A Turkey?

2001
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:57,039
The Turkey is a truly noble bird.

2002
01:53:57,123 --> 01:54:00,209
Native American. Source of
sustenance of our original settlers.

2003
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:02,503
An incredibly brave fellow
who will not flinch

2004
01:54:02,586 --> 01:54:05,631
at attacking a regiment
of englishmen single-handedly!

2005
01:54:05,714 --> 01:54:08,384
Therefore, the national bird
of America is going to be...

2006
01:54:08,467 --> 01:54:09,468
The eagle!

2007
01:54:09,552 --> 01:54:11,053
The eagle!

2008
01:54:11,554 --> 01:54:14,682
<i>We're waiting for the chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

2009

<i>god knows the temperature's hot enough</i>

2014
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:35,494
<i>to hatch a stone, let alone an egg</i>

2015
01:54:36,912 --> 01:54:40,416
<i>we're waiting

2016
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:43,627
<i>of that tiny little fellow</i>

2017
01:54:43,711 --> 01:54:46,714

<i>but will it hatch an egg?</i>

2023
01:55:02,605 --> 01:55:06,692
The declaration will be a triumph.
I tell you, a triumph.

2024
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:08,903
If I was ever sure of anything,
I'm sure of that.

2025
01:55:08,986 --> 01:55:10,321
A triumph.

2026
01:55:11,447 --> 01:55:16,035
And if it isn't, we've still got four
days left to think of something else.

2027
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:19,663
<i>The eagle's going to crack the shell</i>

2028

01:55:22,583 --> 01:55:25,544

01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:21,308
Thank you, Mr. thomson.

2044
01:56:22,059 --> 01:56:25,980
The congress has heard the report
of the declaration committee.

2045
01:56:26,438 --> 01:56:28,732
Are there any here
who wish to offer alterations,

2046
01:56:28,816 --> 01:56:31,652
deletions, amendments to this declaration?

2047
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:34,113
Mr. president!

2048
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,490
Gentlemen!

2049
01:56:36,574 --> 01:56:39,201
Gentlemen, please!

2050
01:56:40,536 --> 01:56:42,830
Colonel mckean, I saw your hand first.

2051
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:44,456
Mr. Jefferson,

2052
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:47,918
it's a funny paper you've written, tom,
but somewhere in it,

2053
01:56:48,002 --> 01:56:51,964
you mention Scottish
and foreign mercenaries sent to destroy us.

2054
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:54,258
Scottish, tom?

2055
01:56:54,717 --> 01:56:58,053
That is in reference to a highland regiment
which stood against us at Boston.

2056
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:04,226
It's more likely Germans wearing kilts
to disguise their being there.

2057
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:09,273
I ask you to remove the word
and avoid giving offense to a good people.

2058
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:10,858
Mr. Jefferson?

2059
01:57:12,401 --> 01:57:13,861
The reverend...

2060
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,279
Witherspoon.

2061
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:19,700
Mr. Jefferson,
nowhere do you mention the supreme being.

2062
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:21,368
Now, surely this was an oversight,

2063
01:57:21,452 --> 01:57:25,956
for how could we hope to achieve a victory
without his help?

2064
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,500
Therefore, I most humbly
suggest the following addition

2065
01:57:28,584 --> 01:57:30,336
to your final sentence.

2066
01:57:30,419 --> 01:57:34,256
"With a firm reliance
on the protection of divine Providence."

2067
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:35,633
Mr. Jefferson?

2068
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:39,845
Mr. read.

2069
01:57:41,555 --> 01:57:44,600
Among your charges
against the king, Mr. Jefferson,

2070
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:48,812
you accuse him of depriving us of
the benefits of trial by jury.

2071
01:57:48,896 --> 01:57:50,272
This is untrue, sir.

2072
01:57:50,356 --> 01:57:53,275
In Delaware, we've always had trial byjury.

2073
01:57:54,193 --> 01:57:56,028
In Massachusetts, we have not.

2074
01:57:56,779 --> 01:58:00,491
Well, then I suggest that the
words "in many cases" be added.

2075
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:02,951
Mr. Jefferson?

2076
01:58:03,452 --> 01:58:06,664
"In many cases"? Brilliant!

2077
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:09,291
I suppose every time
you see those three words,

2078
01:58:09,375 --> 01:58:11,543
your puny chest will swell with pride

2079
01:58:11,627 --> 01:58:14,296
over your great historical contribution.

2080
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:17,716
It's more memorable
than your unprincipled whitewash

2081
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:19,802
of that race of barbarians!

2082
01:58:19,885 --> 01:58:22,346
Race of barbarians?

2083
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:23,722
Why, I'll have you...

2084
01:58:24,348 --> 01:58:26,725
Colonel mckean, Mr. read, that's enough!

2085
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:30,991
- Mr. Hopkins.
- L've no objections, Johnny.

2086
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,731
I'm just trying to get a drink.

2087
01:58:32,815 --> 01:58:35,066
I should've known. Mcnair, get him a rum.

2088
01:58:35,067 --> 01:58:36,707
I should've known. Mcnair, get him a rum.

2089
01:58:40,948 --> 01:58:42,324
Mr. bartlett.

2090
01:58:43,117 --> 01:58:44,284
Mr. Jefferson.

2091
01:58:44,702 --> 01:58:47,496
I beg you to remember
that we still have friends in england.

2092
01:58:47,579 --> 01:58:51,500
I see no purpose in antagonizing
them with such phrases as...

2093
01:58:52,459 --> 01:58:55,212
"Unfeeling brethren" and "enemies at war."

2094
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:58,632
Our quarrel is with the British king,
not the British people.

2095
01:58:58,716 --> 01:59:00,759
Be sensible, bartlett.

2096
01:59:00,843 --> 01:59:01,844
Remove those phrases,

2097
01:59:01,927 --> 01:59:04,763
and the entire paragraph
becomes meaningless.

2098
01:59:04,847 --> 01:59:08,058
And it so happens that it's one
of the most stirring and poetic

2099
01:59:08,142 --> 01:59:11,478
of any passage
in the entire document. Now...

2100
01:59:11,562 --> 01:59:15,107
We're a congress, Mr. Adams,
not a literary society.

2101
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:17,943
I ask that the entire
paragraph be stricken.

2102
01:59:18,026 --> 01:59:19,027
Mr. Jefferson?

2103
01:59:21,697 --> 01:59:22,781
Good god.

2104
01:59:22,865 --> 01:59:25,826
Jefferson, when are you going to speak up
for your own work?

2105
01:59:25,909 --> 01:59:28,954
I had hoped
that the work would speak for itself.

2106
01:59:29,538 --> 01:59:30,914
Mr. hancock?

2107
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,916
What is it, Mr. mcnair?

2108
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,462
I can't say I'm very fond of
"the United States of America"

2109
01:59:36,545 --> 01:59:38,046
as a name for a new country.

2110
01:59:40,048 --> 01:59:42,801
I don't care what you're fond of, Mr.
Mcnair.

2111
01:59:42,885 --> 01:59:45,471
You're not a member of this congress!

2112
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:50,058
Mr. sherman.

2113
01:59:50,601 --> 01:59:53,562
Brother Jefferson, I noted at least

2114
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:55,773
two distinct and direct references

2115
01:59:55,856 --> 01:59:58,400
to the British parliament
in your declaration.

2116
01:59:58,484 --> 02:00:01,111
Do you think it's wise
to alienate that August body

2117
02:00:01,195 --> 02:00:02,362
in light of our contention

2118
02:00:02,446 --> 02:00:05,073
that they've never
had any authority over us anyway?

2119
02:00:05,157 --> 02:00:07,576
This is a revolution, damn it!

2120
02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:09,745
We're going to have to offend somebody.

2121
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:11,413
Brother hancock!

2122
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:17,836
John.John.

2123
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,440
You'll give yourself an attack of
apoplexy if you're not careful.

2124
02:00:20,464 --> 02:00:21,566
Have you heard what they're doing to it?

2125
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:22,716
- Have you heard?
- I heard.

2126
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,261
And, so far, that's just our friends.
Can you imagine what our enemies will do?

2127
02:00:26,345 --> 02:00:29,097
The word "parliament"
will be removed wherever it occurs.

2128
02:00:29,181 --> 02:00:32,392
They won't be satisfied till they remove
one of the "f's" from Jefferson's name.

2129
02:00:32,476 --> 02:00:35,270
Courage, John. It won't last much longer.

2130
02:00:38,524 --> 02:00:40,025
Mr. Dickinson.

2131
02:00:40,526 --> 02:00:42,569
Mr. Jefferson,

2132
02:00:42,653 --> 02:00:44,530
I have very little interest in your paper,

2133
02:00:44,613 --> 02:00:48,325
as there's no doubt in my mind
that we've all but heard the last of it.

2134
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,994
But I am curious about one thing.

2135
02:00:51,954 --> 02:00:55,374
Why do you refer to king
George as a tyrant?

2136
02:00:57,084 --> 02:00:58,961
Because he is a tyrant.

2137
02:00:59,962 --> 02:01:03,966
I remind you, Mr. Jefferson,
that this tyrant is still your king.

2138
02:01:05,634 --> 02:01:07,886
When a king becomes a tyrant,

2139
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:11,557
he thereby breaks the contract
binding his subjects to him.

2140
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,267
How so?

2141
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:15,477
By taking away their rights.

2142
02:01:15,561 --> 02:01:18,522
Rights that came from
him in the first place?

2143
02:01:18,605 --> 02:01:20,315
All except one.

2144
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:23,110
The right to be free comes from nature.

2145
02:01:23,986 --> 02:01:26,947
And are we not free, Mr. Jefferson?

2146
02:01:29,157 --> 02:01:31,285
Homes entered without warrant.

2147
02:01:31,368 --> 02:01:34,496
Citizens arrested without charge.

2148
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:37,958
And in many places,
free assembly itself denied.

2149
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:40,794
No one approves of such things,

2150
02:01:40,878 --> 02:01:43,171
but these are dangerous times.

2151
02:01:43,255 --> 02:01:44,965
Be careful, Mr. Dickinson.

2152
02:01:45,048 --> 02:01:49,136
Those who give up some of their Liberty in
order to obtain a little temporary safety,

2153
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:51,722
deserve neither Liberty nor safety.

2154
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,766
Mr. Wilson.

2155
02:01:56,268 --> 02:01:59,688
Do we in Pennsylvania
consider king George a tyrant?

2156
02:02:01,023 --> 02:02:03,400
Well, I don't know.

2157
02:02:04,192 --> 02:02:05,319
He...

2158
02:02:07,529 --> 02:02:09,489
No. No, we don't.

2159
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:11,909
He's not a tyrant.

2160
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:14,453
In Pennsylvania.

2161
02:02:14,536 --> 02:02:15,954
There you are, Mr. Jefferson.

2162
02:02:16,038 --> 02:02:18,081
Your declaration does not speak for us all.

2163
02:02:18,165 --> 02:02:20,292
I demand the word "tyrant" be removed.

2164
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:21,375
Very well.

2165
02:02:21,418 --> 02:02:23,587
Just a moment, Mr. thomson.

2166
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:25,297
I do not consent.

2167
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:29,885
The king is a tyrant
whether we say so or not.

2168
02:02:31,178 --> 02:02:32,596
We might as well say so.

2169
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:34,640
But I already scratched it out.

2170
02:02:34,723 --> 02:02:36,683
Then scratch it back in.

2171
02:02:38,435 --> 02:02:41,980
Put it back, Mr. thomson.
The king will remain a tyrant.

2172
02:02:46,068 --> 02:02:47,152
Mr. Hewes.

2173
02:02:47,235 --> 02:02:48,654
Mr. Jefferson.

2174
02:02:48,737 --> 02:02:51,823
Nowhere do you mention
deep-sea fishing rights.

2175
02:02:54,242 --> 02:02:57,245
Good god! Fishing rights!

2176
02:02:58,246 --> 02:03:01,083
How long is this piddling to go on?

2177
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:04,586
We have been here for three full days.

2178
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:08,423
We have endured, by my count,
85 separate changes,

2179
02:03:08,507 --> 02:03:11,927
and the removal of close to 400 words.

2180
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:15,138
Now, would you whip it
and beat it till you break its spirit?

2181
02:03:15,222 --> 02:03:20,894
I tell you that document is a masterful
expression of the American mind!

2182
02:03:26,108 --> 02:03:27,776
If there are no more changes,

2183
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:31,321
then I can assume the report
of the declaration committee has been...

2184
02:03:31,446 --> 02:03:33,448
Just a moment, Mr. president.

2185
02:03:34,449 --> 02:03:35,701
Look out.

2186
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:39,663
I wonder if we might prevail
upon Mr. thomson

2187
02:03:39,746 --> 02:03:43,750
to read again a small portion
of Mr. Jefferson's declaration.

2188
02:03:44,835 --> 02:03:47,671
The one beginning
"he has waged cruel war."

2189
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:52,801
"He has affected... he's combined...

2190
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:55,345
"He's abdicated... he's plundered...

2191
02:03:55,429 --> 02:03:58,098
"He's constrained...
He's excited... he's incited...

2192
02:03:58,181 --> 02:04:00,600
"He's waged cruel war." Here it is.

2193
02:04:00,684 --> 02:04:03,437
"He's waged cruel war
against human nature itself

2194
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,398
"in the persons
of a distant people who never offended him,

2195
02:04:06,481 --> 02:04:10,402
"captivating and carrying them
into slavery in another hemisphere,

2196
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:12,070
"determined to keep open a market

2197
02:04:12,154 --> 02:04:14,114
"where men should be bought and sold,

2198
02:04:14,197 --> 02:04:15,277
"he has prostituted his..."

2199
02:04:15,323 --> 02:04:18,410
That will suffice, Mr. thomson.
I thank you, sir.

2200
02:04:18,493 --> 02:04:23,165
Mr. Jefferson, I can't quite make out
what it is you're talking about.

2201
02:04:25,167 --> 02:04:26,960
Slavery, Mr. Rutledge.

2202
02:04:27,044 --> 02:04:28,295
Oh, yes.

2203
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:31,006
You're referring to us
as slaves of the king.

2204
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:33,759
No, sir. I'm referring to our slaves.

2205
02:04:33,842 --> 02:04:35,343
Black slaves.

2206
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:39,639
Black slaves.

2207
02:04:40,849 --> 02:04:43,101
Why didn't you say so, sir?

2208
02:04:43,185 --> 02:04:45,771
Were you trying to hide your meaning?

2209
02:04:46,521 --> 02:04:47,773
No, sir.

2210
02:04:47,856 --> 02:04:50,692
Just another literary license, then.

2211
02:04:51,818 --> 02:04:53,195
If you like.

2212
02:04:54,071 --> 02:04:56,573
I don't like at all, Mr. Jefferson.

2213
02:04:57,616 --> 02:05:01,661
To us, in south Carolina,
black slavery is our peculiar institution,

2214
02:05:01,745 --> 02:05:03,538
and a cherished way of life.

2215
02:05:03,622 --> 02:05:06,458
Nevertheless, we must abolish it.

2216
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:09,586
Nothing is more certainly written
in the book of fate

2217
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:11,546
than that these people shall be free.

2218
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:15,550
I am not concerned with the book of fate
right now, Mr. Jefferson.

2219
02:05:15,634 --> 02:05:18,274
I'm more concerned with what is
written in that little paper there.

2220
02:05:18,345 --> 02:05:22,057
That little paper there
deals with freedom for Americans.

2221
02:05:24,059 --> 02:05:25,393
Oh, really?

2222
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:28,105
Mr. Adams

2223
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:33,151
is now calling our black
slaves "Americans."

2224
02:05:33,235 --> 02:05:35,362
- Are they, now?
- Yes, they are.

2225
02:05:35,445 --> 02:05:37,948
They're people and they're here.

2226
02:05:38,031 --> 02:05:39,842
If there's any other requirement,
I've never heard of it.

2227
02:05:39,866 --> 02:05:42,744
They are here, yes, but they are not
people, sir. They are property.

2228
02:05:42,828 --> 02:05:47,040
No, sir. They are people
who are being treated as property.

2229
02:05:47,124 --> 02:05:49,835
I tell you, the rights of human nature

2230
02:05:49,918 --> 02:05:53,505
are deeply wounded
by this infamous practice.

2231
02:05:53,588 --> 02:05:57,509
Then see to your own wounds, Mr. Jefferson,
for you are a practitioner!

2232
02:05:57,592 --> 02:05:59,010
Are you not?

2233
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:08,103
I have already resolved

2234
02:06:09,104 --> 02:06:10,897
to release my slaves.

2235
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:30,834
Then I'm sorry,

2236
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:35,797
for you've also resolved
the ruination of your personal economy.

2237
02:06:35,881 --> 02:06:38,258
Economy. Always economy.

2238
02:06:39,384 --> 02:06:42,387
There's more to this
than a filthy purse string, Rutledge.

2239
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:44,556
It's an offense against man and god.

2240
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:48,059
It's a stinking business, Mr. Rutledge.
A stinking business.

2241
02:06:48,143 --> 02:06:50,187
Is it really, Mr. Hopkins?

2242
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:52,355
Then what is that I smell

2243
02:06:52,439 --> 02:06:54,649
floating down from the north?

2244
02:06:56,193 --> 02:06:58,612
Could that be the aroma of hypocrisy?

2245
02:06:58,695 --> 02:07:02,824
For who holds the other end
of that filthy purse string, Mr. Adams?

2246
02:07:06,286 --> 02:07:11,625
Our northern brethren
feeling a bit tender toward our slaves.

2247
02:07:11,708 --> 02:07:13,627
They don't keep slaves.

2248
02:07:14,169 --> 02:07:15,337
Oh, no.

2249
02:07:16,588 --> 02:07:20,383
But they're willing
to be considerable carriers

2250
02:07:20,467 --> 02:07:22,219
of slaves to others.

2251
02:07:22,969 --> 02:07:24,554
They're willing.

2252
02:07:26,014 --> 02:07:27,641
For the shilling.

2253
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:30,477
Or haven't you heard, Mr. Adams?

2254
02:07:31,853 --> 02:07:34,439
Clink, clink.

2255

that our northern friends

2286
02:09:32,474 --> 02:09:36,019
see our black slaves
as merely figures in a ledger.

2287
02:09:36,102 --> 02:09:37,395
Oh, no.

2288
02:09:37,479 --> 02:09:41,733
They see them as figures on a block.

2289
02:09:41,816 --> 02:09:44,486
Look at the faces at the
auctions, gentlemen.

2290
02:09:44,569 --> 02:09:47,072
White faces on African wharves.

2291
02:09:47,155 --> 02:09:48,782
Seafaring faces.

2292
02:09:48,865 --> 02:09:50,617
New england faces.

2293
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:53,078
"Put them in the ships."

2294
02:09:53,161 --> 02:09:55,747
"Cram them in the ships."

02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:59,584
"Stuff them in the ships."

2296
02:09:59,667 --> 02:10:02,962

Mr. Hewes.

Dr. hall.

2329
02:12:30,985 --> 02:12:33,571
Don't worry, John. They'll be back.

2330
02:12:33,655 --> 02:12:36,282
Aye, to vote us down.

2331
02:12:42,956 --> 02:12:44,958
Adams! Franklin!

2332
02:12:46,501 --> 02:12:48,419
It's done. I have it.

2333
02:12:48,503 --> 02:12:50,964
And the Maryland assembly's approved it.

2334
02:12:51,047 --> 02:12:56,177
I told them about one of the
greatest military engagements in history

2335
02:12:56,261 --> 02:12:58,388
against a flock of...

2336
02:13:01,683 --> 02:13:03,142
What's wrong?

2337
02:13:04,727 --> 02:13:07,730
- I thought...
- You'll have to forgive them, Mr. chase.

2338
02:13:07,814 --> 02:13:10,483
They just suffered a slight setback.

2339
02:13:10,567 --> 02:13:13,278
And after all, "what is a man profited

2340
02:13:13,361 --> 02:13:17,615
"if he shall gain Maryland
and lose the entire south?"

2341
02:13:18,825 --> 02:13:21,703
Matthew, chapter 16, verse 26.

2342
02:13:23,454 --> 02:13:24,664
Mcnair.

2343
02:13:25,331 --> 02:13:27,166
I know. The flies.

2344
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:28,293
No.

2345
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:30,461
The rum.

2346
02:13:35,091 --> 02:13:37,885
Well, what are we all sitting around for?

2347
02:13:39,262 --> 02:13:40,972
We're wasting time. Precious time.

2348
02:13:41,055 --> 02:13:43,141
Thomas, I want you
to ride down into Delaware

2349
02:13:43,224 --> 02:13:44,851
and fetch back Caesar Rodney.

2350
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:48,271
John, are you mad?
It's 80 miles, and he's a dying man.

2351
02:13:48,354 --> 02:13:50,398
No, he's a patriot.

2352
02:13:50,481 --> 02:13:52,859
John, what good will it do?
The south's done us in.

2353
02:13:52,942 --> 02:13:54,569
And suppose they change their minds?

2354
02:13:54,652 --> 02:13:57,155
Can we get Delaware without Rodney?

2355
02:13:59,907 --> 02:14:02,952
God! What a bastardly bunch we are.

2356
02:14:05,496 --> 02:14:08,750
- Stephen, I want you to...
- L'm going to the tavern, Johnny.

2357
02:14:08,833 --> 02:14:12,378
If there's anything I can do for you there,
let me know.

2358
02:14:13,296 --> 02:14:14,464
Chase.

2359
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:16,424
Bartlett!

2360
02:14:16,507 --> 02:14:20,094
What's the use, John?
The vote's tomorrow morning.

2361
02:14:20,178 --> 02:14:22,597
There's less than a full day left.

2362
02:14:25,975 --> 02:14:27,518
Roger.

2363
02:14:27,602 --> 02:14:30,104
Face facts, John. It's finished.

2364
02:14:32,857 --> 02:14:34,442
I'm sorry, John.

2365
02:14:42,825 --> 02:14:44,786
We have no choice, John.

2366
02:14:45,953 --> 02:14:47,789
The slavery clause has got to go.

2367
02:14:51,042 --> 02:14:52,460
Franklin, what are you saying?

2368
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,754
It's a luxury we can't afford.

2369
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:57,131
A luxury?

2370
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:03,304
A half million souls in chains,

2371
02:15:03,388 --> 02:15:06,391
and Dr. Franklin calls it a luxury.

2372
02:15:07,517 --> 02:15:09,394
Maybe you should've
walked out with the south.

2373
02:15:09,936 --> 02:15:11,896
You forget yourself, sir.

2374
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:15,149
I founded the first anti-slavery society
on this continent.

2375
02:15:15,608 --> 02:15:18,903
Don't wave your credentials at me.
Perhaps it's time you had them renewed.

2376
02:15:19,529 --> 02:15:22,573
The issue here is independence.

2377
02:15:22,657 --> 02:15:25,451
Perhaps you've forgotten that fact,
but I have not.

2378
02:15:25,535 --> 02:15:29,080
How dare you jeopardize our cause

2379
02:15:29,163 --> 02:15:31,082
when we've come so far!

2380
02:15:32,709 --> 02:15:34,043
These men,

2381
02:15:35,336 --> 02:15:37,588
no matter how much
we may disagree with them,

2382
02:15:37,672 --> 02:15:41,092
are not ribbon clerks to be ordered about.

2383
02:15:41,175 --> 02:15:44,387
They're proud, accomplished men.
The cream of their colonies.

2384
02:15:44,470 --> 02:15:47,473
And whether you like it or not,
they and the people they represent

2385
02:15:47,557 --> 02:15:51,436
will be part of this new nation
you hope to create.

2386
02:15:51,519 --> 02:15:54,731
Now either learn how to live with them
or pack up and go home.

2387
02:16:00,361 --> 02:16:03,448
In any case,
stop acting like a Boston fishwife.

2388
02:16:17,545 --> 02:16:20,423
Good god. What's happened to me?

2389
02:16:20,506 --> 02:16:23,801
John Adams. The great John Adams.

2390
02:16:24,302 --> 02:16:25,845
What have I come to?

2391
02:16:25,928 --> 02:16:27,805
Law practice down the pipe.

2392
02:16:27,889 --> 02:16:30,016
Farm mortgaged to the hilt.

2393
02:16:30,099 --> 02:16:33,227
At a stage in life when other men prosper,

2394
02:16:33,311 --> 02:16:35,938
I'm reduced to living in Philadelphia.

2395
02:16:37,982 --> 02:16:39,442
Philadelphia.

2396
02:16:48,826 --> 02:16:51,412
Abigail, what am I going to do?

2397
02:16:51,496 --> 02:16:52,747
<i>Do, John?</i>

2398
02:16:54,081 --> 02:16:55,750
I need your help.

2399
02:16:56,417 --> 02:16:59,045
<i>You don't usually ask my advice.</i>

2400
02:16:59,128 --> 02:17:02,548
Yes, well, there doesn't appear
to be anyone else right now.

2401
02:17:02,632 --> 02:17:04,759
<i>Very well, John. What is it?</i>

2402
02:17:05,510 --> 02:17:08,930
The entire south
has just walked out of this congress,

2403
02:17:09,555 --> 02:17:13,518
George Washington
is on the verge of total annihilation,

2404
02:17:13,601 --> 02:17:16,604
and the precious cause for which I
have labored these several years

2405
02:17:16,687 --> 02:17:18,439
has come to nothing.

2406
02:17:20,399 --> 02:17:23,861
And it seems
that I'm obnoxious and disliked.

2407
02:17:23,945 --> 02:17:25,571
<i>Nonsense, John.</i>

2408
02:17:26,322 --> 02:17:28,783
That I am unwilling to face reality.

2409
02:17:28,866 --> 02:17:30,993
<i>Foolishness, John.</i>

2410
02:17:31,077 --> 02:17:32,787
That I'm pigheaded.

2411
02:17:33,412 --> 02:17:35,206
<i>Well, there you have me, John.</i>

2412
02:17:35,289 --> 02:17:37,333
<i>I'm afraid you are pigheaded.</i>

2413
02:17:41,254 --> 02:17:42,588
Well, yes.

2414
02:17:45,174 --> 02:17:46,467
Abby.

2415
02:17:47,927 --> 02:17:50,638
Has it been any kind of a life for you?

2416
02:17:51,514 --> 02:17:53,766
God knows I haven't given you very much.

2417
02:17:54,642 --> 02:17:56,519
I never asked for more.

2418
02:17:57,311 --> 02:17:59,230
After all, I am Mrs. John Adams.

2419
02:17:59,313 --> 02:18:01,858
That's quite a lot for one lifetime.

2420
02:18:04,151 --> 02:18:05,570
Is it, Abby?

2421
02:18:06,362 --> 02:18:08,364
Well, think of it, John.
To be married to the man

2422
02:18:08,447 --> 02:18:11,534
who is always the first
in line to be hanged...

2423
02:18:15,872 --> 02:18:17,790
Yes. The agitator.

2424
02:18:20,334 --> 02:18:21,669
Why, Abby?

2425
02:18:23,754 --> 02:18:26,173
You must tell me what it is. I...

2426
02:18:26,841 --> 02:18:30,094
Well, I have always been dissatisfied.
I know that.

2427
02:18:31,596 --> 02:18:36,183
But lately, i
find that I reek of discontentment.

2428
02:18:36,267 --> 02:18:39,604
It fills my throat and it floods my brain.

2429
02:18:43,941 --> 02:18:46,861
Sometimes I fear there
is no longer a dream,

2430
02:18:48,154 --> 02:18:50,281
but only the discontentment.

2431
02:18:52,408 --> 02:18:53,826
Oh, John.

2432
02:18:56,245 --> 02:18:59,248
Can you really know so
little about yourself?

2433
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,126
Can you think so little of me

2434
02:19:02,209 --> 02:19:05,588
that you'd believe
I'd marry the man you've described?

2435
02:19:07,757 --> 02:19:11,344
Have you forgotten
what you used to say to me? I haven't.

2436
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:14,805
"Commitment, Abby.

2437
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:17,266
"Commitment.

2438
02:19:18,726 --> 02:19:22,730
"There are only two creatures of value
on the face of this earth.

2439
02:19:23,814 --> 02:19:25,983
"Those with a commitment,

2440
02:19:26,067 --> 02:19:29,236
"and those who require
the commitment of others."

2441
02:19:31,405 --> 02:19:33,240
Do you remember, John?

2442
02:19:35,493 --> 02:19:37,078
Yes, I remember.

2443
02:19:37,703 --> 02:19:39,622
Mr. Adams!

2444
02:19:41,248 --> 02:19:43,584
Are you up there, Mr. Adams?

2445
02:19:44,251 --> 02:19:45,920
What do you want?

2446
02:19:46,337 --> 02:19:50,132
There's a delivery down here for you.

2447
02:19:50,216 --> 02:19:51,592
What is it?

2448
02:19:53,469 --> 02:19:55,680
Where did it come from? Who sent it?

2449
02:20:01,936 --> 02:20:06,565
<i>Compliments of
the Concord ladies' coffee club</i>

2450
02:20:06,649 --> 02:20:11,529
<i>and the sisterhood of the truro synagogue</i>

2451
02:20:11,612 --> 02:20:16,492
<i>and the Friday evening
baptist sewing circle</i>

2452
02:20:16,575 --> 02:20:21,539
<i>and the holy Christian sisters of St.
Claire</i>

2453
02:20:21,622 --> 02:20:25,626
<i>all for you</i>

2454
02:20:25,710 --> 02:20:28,838
<i>John</i>

2455
02:20:28,921 --> 02:20:34,343
<i>I am as I ever was</i>

2456
02:20:34,427 --> 02:20:39,306

2458
02:20:44,979 --> 02:20:47,606
<i>yours</i>

2459
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:50,943
Abigail, what's in these kegs?

2460
02:20:51,444 --> 02:20:57,992
<i>Saltpeter, John</i>

2461
02:21:05,833 --> 02:21:07,001
mcnair!

2462
02:21:07,877 --> 02:21:11,088
Mcnair, go out and buy every damned pin
you can find in Philadelphia.

2463
02:21:11,172 --> 02:21:12,923
Pin? What sort of pin?

2464
02:21:13,007 --> 02:21:15,926
Well, I don't know.
Whatever the ladies use for their sewing.

2465
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:19,430
Franklin, Jefferson,
what are you all sitting around for?

2466
02:21:19,513 --> 02:21:21,223
Didn't you hear a word I said before?

2467
02:21:21,307 --> 02:21:23,059
Never mind about that.

2468
02:21:23,142 --> 02:21:24,769
Now, here's what I want you to do.

2469
02:21:24,852 --> 02:21:27,063
John, I'm not even speaking to you.

2470
02:21:27,146 --> 02:21:29,899
It's too late for that, damn it.
There's work to be done.

2471
02:21:29,982 --> 02:21:31,817
Jefferson, go find Rutledge.

2472
02:21:31,901 --> 02:21:33,861
Don't come back
until you've worn him down.

2473
02:21:33,944 --> 02:21:35,863
Now, you're both Southern aristocrats.

2474
02:21:35,946 --> 02:21:38,032
If he'll listen to anybody,
he'll listen to you.

2475
02:21:38,115 --> 02:21:40,034
Franklin, out of that chair!

2476
02:21:40,117 --> 02:21:42,745
What good is the south
if you can't deliver Pennsylvania?

2477
02:21:42,828 --> 02:21:44,413
Talk to Wilson.

2478
02:21:44,497 --> 02:21:45,748
Get him away from Dickinson.

2479
02:21:45,831 --> 02:21:49,001
That's the only way to do it.
Go on, now, both of you.

2480
02:21:49,210 --> 02:21:51,712
- John...
- Time's running out, damn it.

2481
02:21:52,588 --> 02:21:53,881
Now move.

2482
02:21:57,259 --> 02:21:58,803
I'm still from Massachusetts, John.

2483
02:22:00,763 --> 02:22:02,681
You know where I stand.

2484
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:04,475
I'll do whatever you say.

2485
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:09,188
No.

2486
02:22:10,481 --> 02:22:13,067
No, you're the president of congress.

2487
02:22:14,318 --> 02:22:17,029
You're a fair man, hancock. Stay that way.

2488
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:42,763
Tell me, Mr. thomson, out of curiosity,

2489
02:22:43,472 --> 02:22:47,059
do you stand with Mr. Dickinson,
or do you stand with me?

2490
02:22:49,019 --> 02:22:51,021
I stand with the general.

2491
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:57,236
Well, lately,
I've had the oddest feeling that he's been

2492
02:22:57,319 --> 02:22:58,821
writing to me.

2493
02:23:02,908 --> 02:23:05,911
<i>I have been in expectation</i>

2494
02:23:05,995 --> 02:23:09,206
<i>of receiving a reply</i>

2495

02:23:16,630 --> 02:23:21,886
<i>ls anybody there?</i>

2497
02:23:23,053 --> 02:23:28,642
<i>Does anybody care?</i>

2498
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:35,232
<i>Does anybody care?</i>

2499
02:23:37,401 --> 02:23:39,820
"Your humble and obedient..."

2500
02:24:13,062 --> 02:24:14,730
"Ls anybody there?

2501
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,653
"Does anybody care?"

2502
02:24:24,323 --> 02:24:30,829
<i>Does anybody see what I see?</i>

2503
02:24:34,541 --> 02:24:36,877
<i>They want me to quit</i>

2504
02:24:37,878 --> 02:24:42,216
<i>they say, "John, give up the fight"</i>

2505
02:24:42,299 --> 02:24:45,386
<i>still to england, I say</i>

2506
02:24:45,469 --> 02:24:48,889
<i>good night, forever, good night!</i>

2507
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:54,561
<i>For I have crossed the rubicon</i>

2508
02:24:54,645 --> 02:24:57,439
<i>let the bridge be burned behind me</i>

2509
02:24:57,523 --> 02:24:59,817

2511
02:25:02,069 --> 02:25:03,153
commitment!

2512
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:07,825
<i>The croakers all say we'll rue the day</i>

2513
02:25:07,908 --> 02:25:13,163

<i>through all the gloom,

2515
02:25:17,084 --> 02:25:21,046

02:25:21,130 --> 02:25:23,465

<i>Does anybody see what I see?</i>

2520
02:25:34,476 --> 02:25:36,437
<i>I see fireworks</i>

2521
02:25:37,146 --> 02:25:40,482
<i>I see the pageant and pomp and parade</i>

2522
02:25:40,566 --> 02:25:43,027
<i>I hear the bells ringing out</i>

2523
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:46,238
<i>I hear the cannons roar</i>

2524
02:25:46,322 --> 02:25:48,866
<i>I see Americans</i>

2525
02:25:48,949 --> 02:25:52,369

02:26:15,476 --> 02:26:22,316
<i>how silent, how silent the chamber is</i>

02:26:26,070 --> 02:26:31,450
<i>ls anybody there?</i>

2530
02:26:32,826 --> 02:26:37,998
<i>Does anybody care?</i>

<i>Does anybody see what I see?</i>

2532
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:48,384
Yes, Mr. Adams.

2533
02:26:50,386 --> 02:26:51,553
I do.

2534
02:26:55,349 --> 02:26:56,642
Dr. hall.

2535
02:26:57,434 --> 02:26:59,520
I didn't know anyone was...

2536
02:27:00,646 --> 02:27:02,773
I'm sorry if I startled you.

2537
02:27:03,649 --> 02:27:05,275
I couldn't sleep.

2538
02:27:06,318 --> 02:27:09,738
And in trying to resolve my dilemma,

2539
02:27:09,822 --> 02:27:12,741
I remembered something I'd once read.

2540
02:27:12,825 --> 02:27:16,620
That a representative
owes the people not only his industry,

2541
02:27:16,703 --> 02:27:19,206
but his judgment.

2542
02:27:19,289 --> 02:27:22,751
And he betrays them
if he sacrifices it to their opinion.

2543
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:28,257
That was written by Edmund Burke,

2544
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:32,302
a member of the British parliament.

2545
02:28:01,248 --> 02:28:03,167
Good night, Mr. Adams.

2546
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:04,585
Good night.

2547
02:28:15,679 --> 02:28:17,389
<i>It's never been done before.</i>

2548
02:28:17,473 --> 02:28:20,118
<i>No colony has ever broken from the
parent stem in the history of the world.</i>

2549
02:28:20,142 --> 02:28:22,811
<i>If you have grievances,
and I'm sure you have,</i>

2550
02:28:22,895 --> 02:28:26,023
<i>our present system must provide
a gentler means of redressing them</i>

2551
02:28:26,106 --> 02:28:28,233
<i>- short of revolution.
- We've spawned a new race here.</i>

2552
02:28:28,317 --> 02:28:29,526
<i>Rougher, simpler,</i>

2553
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:32,321
<i>more violent, more
enterprising, less refined.</i>

2554
02:28:32,404 --> 02:28:35,866
<i>"My quartermaster has no food,
no arms, no ammunition,</i>

2555
02:28:35,949 --> 02:28:38,660
<i>"and my troops are in a
state of near mutiny."</i>

2556
02:28:38,744 --> 02:28:40,638
<i>- No army, no Navy...
- "I pray god some relief arrives</i>

2557
02:28:40,662 --> 02:28:43,099
<i>- "before the armada, but fear it will not."
- No arms, no ammunition,</i>

2558
02:28:43,123 --> 02:28:46,043
<i>- no treasury, no friends.
- And when they hang you, Mr. Adams,</i>

2559
02:28:46,126 --> 02:28:48,629
<i>I do hope you'll put in a good word
for the rest of us.</i>

2560
02:28:48,712 --> 02:28:51,840
<i>England closing in, cutting off our air.</i>

2561
02:28:51,924 --> 02:28:52,925
<i>There's no time!</i>

2562
02:28:53,008 --> 02:28:56,178
<i>To place before mankind
the common sense of the subject...</i>

2563
02:28:56,261 --> 02:28:58,555
<i>The issue here is independence.</i>

2564
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:00,575
<i>Perhaps you've lost sight of that fact,
but I have not.</i>

2565
02:29:00,599 --> 02:29:02,285
<i>"We mutually pledge to each other our lives</i>

2566
02:29:02,309 --> 02:29:05,312
<i>"our fortunes and our sacred honor."</i>

2567
02:29:06,063 --> 02:29:09,066
<i>Can you really know so
little about yourself?</i>

2568
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:15,447
Very well.

2569
02:29:17,366 --> 02:29:21,537
The congress will now vote
on Virginia's resolution on independence.

2570
02:29:29,545 --> 02:29:30,796
Thank you for coming, Caesar.

2571
02:29:31,755 --> 02:29:33,507
God bless you, sir.

2572
02:29:39,012 --> 02:29:41,181
The secretary will call the roll.

2573
02:29:41,265 --> 02:29:44,226
And I remind you, gentlemen,

2574
02:29:44,309 --> 02:29:46,478
that a single "nay" vote

2575
02:29:47,604 --> 02:29:49,523
will defeat the motion.

2576
02:29:50,816 --> 02:29:52,192
Mr. thomson.

2577
02:29:57,364 --> 02:29:58,865
New Hampshire?

2578
02:29:59,241 --> 02:30:00,409
New Hampshire says yea.

2579
02:30:00,492 --> 02:30:02,995
New Hampshire says yea. Massachusetts?

2580
02:30:03,078 --> 02:30:04,246
Massachusetts says yea.

2581
02:30:04,329 --> 02:30:06,707
Massachusetts says yea. Rhode Island?

2582
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:08,125
Rhode Island says yea.

2583
02:30:08,208 --> 02:30:10,752
Rhode Island says yea. Connecticut?

2584
02:30:10,836 --> 02:30:12,045
Connecticut says yea.

2585
02:30:12,129 --> 02:30:14,923
Connecticut says yea. New York?

2586
02:30:15,007 --> 02:30:18,260
Mr. secretary,
New York abstains courteously.

2587
02:30:18,343 --> 02:30:20,679
- New York abstains.
- Courteously.

2588
02:30:22,097 --> 02:30:23,640
New Jersey?

2589
02:30:23,724 --> 02:30:25,017
New Jersey says yea.

2590
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:27,686
New Jersey says yea. Pennsylvania?

2591
02:30:29,688 --> 02:30:31,857
Mr. secretary, Pennsylvania is not ready.

2592
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:34,151
Please come back to us later.

2593
02:30:34,234 --> 02:30:36,486
Pennsylvania passes. Delaware?

2594
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:37,613
Just a moment.

2595
02:30:38,655 --> 02:30:41,908
Delaware, by majority vote...

2596
02:30:42,492 --> 02:30:45,162
- Aye.
- Says yea.

2597
02:30:45,245 --> 02:30:48,206
Delaware says yea. Maryland?

2598
02:30:48,290 --> 02:30:49,499
Maryland says yea.

2599
02:30:49,583 --> 02:30:51,209
Maryland says yea. Virginia?

2600
02:30:51,293 --> 02:30:52,336
Virginia says yea.

2601
02:30:52,419 --> 02:30:54,504
Virginia says yea. North Carolina?

2602
02:30:54,588 --> 02:30:57,341
North Carolina yields to south Carolina.

2603
02:30:58,592 --> 02:30:59,593
South Carolina?

2604
02:31:00,594 --> 02:31:02,262
Well, Mr. Adams?

2605
02:31:03,388 --> 02:31:04,681
Well, Mr. Rutledge.

2606
02:31:07,768 --> 02:31:09,102
Mr. Adams,

2607
02:31:11,605 --> 02:31:15,567
you must believe
that I will do what I promised to do.

2608
02:31:22,324 --> 02:31:23,909
What is it you want, Rutledge?

2609
02:31:23,992 --> 02:31:27,621
Remove the offending passage
from your declaration.

2610
02:31:27,996 --> 02:31:30,123
If we did that, we would be guilty

2611
02:31:30,207 --> 02:31:33,126
of what we ourselves are rebelling against.

2612
02:31:35,087 --> 02:31:37,297
Nevertheless remove it,

2613
02:31:38,048 --> 02:31:41,134
or south Carolina will bury now and forever

2614
02:31:41,218 --> 02:31:43,303
your dream of independence.

2615
02:31:44,346 --> 02:31:47,808
John, I beg you, consider
what you're doing.

2616
02:31:54,773 --> 02:31:56,400
Mark me, Franklin,

2617
02:31:57,526 --> 02:31:59,986
if we give in on this issue,

2618
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:02,572
posterity will never forgive us.

2619
02:32:02,656 --> 02:32:04,741
That's probably true,
but we won't hear a thing.

2620
02:32:04,825 --> 02:32:06,910
We'll be long gone.

2621
02:32:06,993 --> 02:32:11,331
Besides, what will posterity think we were?
Demigods?

2622
02:32:11,998 --> 02:32:13,583
We're men, no more, no less,

2623
02:32:13,667 --> 02:32:16,545
trying to get a nation started
against greater odds

2624
02:32:16,628 --> 02:32:19,506
than a more generous god
would have allowed.

2625
02:32:20,132 --> 02:32:23,385
First things first, John.
Independence. America.

2626
02:32:23,468 --> 02:32:25,929
If we don't secure that,

2627
02:32:26,012 --> 02:32:28,515
what difference will the rest make?

2628
02:32:34,646 --> 02:32:36,648
Jefferson, say something.

2629
02:32:39,109 --> 02:32:41,111
What else is there to do?

2630
02:32:42,028 --> 02:32:44,781
Well, man, you're the one that wrote it.

2631
02:32:45,657 --> 02:32:48,785
I wrote all of it, Mr. Adams.

2632
02:33:10,056 --> 02:33:11,266
There.

2633
02:33:11,349 --> 02:33:14,120
There it is, Rutledge. You have your
slavery. Little good may it do you.

2634
02:33:14,144 --> 02:33:16,062
You now vote, damn you!

2635
02:33:17,647 --> 02:33:21,443
Mr. president,
the fair colony of south Carolina

2636
02:33:22,736 --> 02:33:24,321
says yea.

2637
02:33:24,404 --> 02:33:25,906
South Carolina says yea.

2638
02:33:25,989 --> 02:33:27,491
North Carolina says yea.

2639
02:33:27,574 --> 02:33:29,534
North Carolina says yea.

2640
02:33:31,077 --> 02:33:32,162
Georgia?

2641
02:33:32,245 --> 02:33:33,622
Georgia says yea.

2642
02:33:33,705 --> 02:33:35,248
Georgia says yea.

2643
02:33:36,583 --> 02:33:38,376
Pennsylvania, second call.

2644
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:42,255
Mr. president,

2645
02:33:42,339 --> 02:33:45,509
Pennsylvania regrets
all of the inconvenience

2646
02:33:45,592 --> 02:33:50,639
that such distinguished men
as Adams, Franklin and Jefferson

2647
02:33:50,722 --> 02:33:52,557
were put to just now.

2648
02:33:52,641 --> 02:33:54,434
They might've kept their document intact

2649
02:33:54,518 --> 02:33:57,103
for all the difference it will make.

2650
02:33:57,187 --> 02:33:58,814
Mr. president,

2651
02:33:59,231 --> 02:34:00,607
Pennsylvania says...

2652
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:01,775
Just a moment.

2653
02:34:03,443 --> 02:34:05,445
I ask the delegation to be polled.

2654
02:34:06,196 --> 02:34:08,323
Dr. Franklin, don't be absurd.

2655
02:34:08,782 --> 02:34:11,785
A poll, Mr. president.
It's a proper request.

2656
02:34:12,035 --> 02:34:13,203
Yes, it is.

2657
02:34:13,286 --> 02:34:15,580
Poll the delegation, Mr. thomson.

2658
02:34:15,664 --> 02:34:17,374
Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

2659
02:34:17,457 --> 02:34:18,500
Yea.

2660
02:34:18,583 --> 02:34:20,544
Mr. John Dickinson.

2661
02:34:20,627 --> 02:34:22,003
Nay.

2662
02:34:22,087 --> 02:34:23,713
Mr. James Wilson.

2663
02:34:26,925 --> 02:34:28,385
Judge Wilson?

2664
02:34:31,555 --> 02:34:34,140
There it is, Mr. Wilson.
It's all up to you now.

2665
02:34:34,224 --> 02:34:35,904
The whole question
of American independence

2666
02:34:35,976 --> 02:34:38,562
rests squarely on your shoulders.

2667
02:34:38,645 --> 02:34:42,190
An entirely new nation
ready to be born or to die at birth,

2668
02:34:42,274 --> 02:34:43,984
all on your say-so.

2669
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:47,320
Which will it be, Mr. Wilson?

2670
02:34:47,779 --> 02:34:51,324
Every mapmaker in the world
is waiting for your decision.

2671
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:55,078
Come now, James. Nothing has changed.

2672
02:34:55,161 --> 02:34:57,914
We mustn't let Dr. Franklin
create one of his confusions.

2673
02:34:57,998 --> 02:34:59,875
The question is clear.

2674
02:35:00,375 --> 02:35:03,920
Most questions are clear
when someone else has to decide them.

2675
02:35:04,004 --> 02:35:05,463
It would be a pity for a man

2676
02:35:05,547 --> 02:35:08,091
who's handed down hundreds
of wise decisions

2677
02:35:08,174 --> 02:35:10,010
from the bench

2678
02:35:10,093 --> 02:35:13,263
to be remembered only
for the one unwise decision

2679
02:35:13,346 --> 02:35:15,140
he made in congress.

2680
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:19,561
James, you're keeping everybody waiting.

2681
02:35:19,644 --> 02:35:21,688
The secretary has called for your vote.

2682
02:35:22,564 --> 02:35:23,773
Please.

2683
02:35:25,108 --> 02:35:28,695
Don't push me, John.
I know what you want me to do.

2684
02:35:31,448 --> 02:35:34,242
But Mr. Adams is correct about one thing.

2685
02:35:36,745 --> 02:35:39,497
I'm the one who'll be remembered for it.

2686
02:35:39,789 --> 02:35:40,874
What do you mean?

2687
02:35:46,588 --> 02:35:48,798
I'm different from you, John.

2688
02:35:49,633 --> 02:35:52,385
I'm different from most of the men here.

2689
02:35:53,345 --> 02:35:55,555
I don't want to be remembered.

2690
02:35:56,806 --> 02:35:58,767
I just don't want the

2691
02:35:59,601 --> 02:36:01,144
responsibility.

2692
02:36:02,270 --> 02:36:04,773
Yes, well, whether you
want it or not, James,

2693
02:36:04,856 --> 02:36:07,108
there's no way of avoiding it.

2694
02:36:07,192 --> 02:36:09,069
Not necessarily, John.

2695
02:36:09,736 --> 02:36:11,738
If I go with them,

2696
02:36:11,821 --> 02:36:14,074
I'll just be one among dozens.

2697
02:36:15,909 --> 02:36:19,162
No one will ever remember
the name of James Wilson.

2698
02:36:20,538 --> 02:36:22,415
But if I vote with you,

2699
02:36:23,917 --> 02:36:27,253
I'll be the man
who prevented American independence.

2700
02:36:30,090 --> 02:36:31,716
I'm sorry, John.

2701
02:36:33,134 --> 02:36:35,428
I just didn't bargain for that.

2702
02:36:37,013 --> 02:36:40,433
And is that how new nations are formed?

2703
02:36:41,851 --> 02:36:44,354
By a nonentity trying to preserve

2704
02:36:44,437 --> 02:36:47,732
the anonymity he so richly deserves?

2705
02:36:48,608 --> 02:36:52,028
Revolutions come into this world
like bastard children, Mr. Dickinson.

2706
02:36:52,112 --> 02:36:54,698
Half improvised and half compromised.

2707
02:36:54,781 --> 02:36:57,200
Our side has provided the compromise.

2708
02:36:57,283 --> 02:36:59,953
Now judge Wilson is supplying the rest.

2709
02:37:04,124 --> 02:37:05,291
James.

2710
02:37:06,835 --> 02:37:08,461
I'm sorry, John.

2711
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:10,714
My vote

2712
02:37:11,923 --> 02:37:13,174
is yea.

2713
02:37:13,967 --> 02:37:15,802
Mr. secretary, Pennsylvania says yea.

2714
02:37:18,638 --> 02:37:22,267
The count being 12 to none

2715
02:37:24,394 --> 02:37:25,729
with one abstention,

2716
02:37:26,104 --> 02:37:28,314
the resolution on independence

2717
02:37:30,275 --> 02:37:31,651
is adopted.

2718
02:37:33,111 --> 02:37:34,446
It's done.

2719
02:37:37,782 --> 02:37:39,117
It's done.

2720
02:37:41,828 --> 02:37:43,204
Mr. thomson,

2721
02:37:44,164 --> 02:37:45,749
is the declaration ready to be signed?

2722
02:37:45,832 --> 02:37:47,459
It is.

2723
02:37:47,542 --> 02:37:49,502
Then I suggest we do so.

2724
02:37:51,337 --> 02:37:53,006
And the chair further proposes,

2725
02:37:53,089 --> 02:37:55,800
for our mutual security and protection,

2726
02:37:57,719 --> 02:37:59,679
that no man be allowed
to sit in this congress

2727
02:37:59,763 --> 02:38:02,057
without attaching his name to it.

2728
02:38:05,101 --> 02:38:07,979
I'm sorry, Mr. president.

2729
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:13,735
I cannot, in good conscience,
sign such a document.

2730
02:38:15,361 --> 02:38:19,616
I will never stop hoping for our
eventual reconciliation with england.

2731
02:38:21,284 --> 02:38:23,453
But because,

2732
02:38:24,704 --> 02:38:26,206
in my own way,

2733
02:38:27,207 --> 02:38:30,710
I regard America no less
than does Mr. Adams,

2734
02:38:32,796 --> 02:38:36,674
I will join the army and
fight in her defense

2735
02:38:38,218 --> 02:38:41,304
even though I believe
that fight to be hopeless.

2736
02:38:46,976 --> 02:38:48,728
Goodbye, gentlemen.

2737
02:38:50,814 --> 02:38:52,982
Gentlemen of the congress,

2738
02:38:53,066 --> 02:38:55,401
I say yea, John Dickinson.

2739
02:39:07,122 --> 02:39:08,456
Very well.

2740
02:39:09,415 --> 02:39:11,167
Are there any objections to the declaration

2741
02:39:11,251 --> 02:39:12,836
being approved as it now stands?

2742
02:39:13,336 --> 02:39:14,462
I have one, Mr. hancock.

2743
02:39:15,338 --> 02:39:16,881
You, Mr. Adams?

2744
02:39:17,423 --> 02:39:19,509
Yes. Mr. Jefferson,

2745
02:39:19,968 --> 02:39:24,097
it so happens that the
word is "unalienable,"

2746
02:39:24,180 --> 02:39:25,974
not "inalienable."

2747
02:39:27,684 --> 02:39:31,771
I'm sorry, Mr. Adams,
but "inalienable" is correct.

2748
02:39:33,314 --> 02:39:36,484
I happen to be a Harvard graduate,
Mr. Jefferson.

2749
02:39:39,612 --> 02:39:42,323
I attended William and Mary, Mr. Adams.

2750
02:39:43,741 --> 02:39:44,993
Gentlemen, please!

2751
02:39:45,076 --> 02:39:48,580
Mr. Jefferson,
will you yield to Mr. Adams' request?

2752
02:39:50,915 --> 02:39:53,126
No, sir. Lwill not.

2753
02:39:59,841 --> 02:40:01,718
Very well. I withdraw it.

2754
02:40:02,260 --> 02:40:03,970
Good for you, John.

2755
02:40:08,641 --> 02:40:11,102
I'll speak to the printer
about it later on.

2756
02:40:13,688 --> 02:40:15,481
Very well, gentlemen.

2757
02:40:16,024 --> 02:40:19,861
We're about to brave the storm
in a skiff made of paper.

2758
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:23,072
And how it shall end,

2759
02:40:23,156 --> 02:40:24,699
god only knows.

2760
02:40:26,701 --> 02:40:28,828
That's a pretty large signature, Johnny.

2761
02:40:28,912 --> 02:40:31,998
So fat George in London
can read it without his glasses.

2762
02:40:34,626 --> 02:40:38,963
All right, step right up, gentlemen.
Don't miss your chance to commit treason.

2763
02:40:40,798 --> 02:40:44,844
Hancock is right.
This paper is our passport to the gallows.

2764
02:40:44,928 --> 02:40:46,179
But there's no backing out now,

2765
02:40:46,262 --> 02:40:47,489
for if we do not hang together,

2766
02:40:47,513 --> 02:40:50,266
we shall most assuredly hang separately.

2767
02:40:52,518 --> 02:40:55,063
In my case, hanging won't be so bad.

2768
02:40:55,146 --> 02:40:58,274
One snap and it'll be all
over, just like that.

2769
02:40:58,358 --> 02:40:59,776
But look at read there.

2770
02:40:59,859 --> 02:41:02,904
He'll be dancing a jig long after I'm gone!

2771
02:41:04,864 --> 02:41:07,992
Gentlemen, forgive me
if I don't join in the merriment,

2772
02:41:08,076 --> 02:41:10,036
but if we are arrested now,

2773
02:41:10,161 --> 02:41:13,248
my name is still the only one
on the damn thing!

2774
02:41:33,726 --> 02:41:37,063
"From the commander,
army of the united colonies in..."

2775
02:41:38,273 --> 02:41:42,151
Army of the United States in New York,

2776

02:42:24,110 --> 02:42:27,071
