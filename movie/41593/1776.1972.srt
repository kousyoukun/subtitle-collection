1
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,607
McNAlR:
Mr. Adams!

2
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:33,407
Mr. Adams!

3
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:36,252
There you are.

4
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,120
Didn't you hear me
call you, Mr. Adams?

5
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,668
You could've shouted
down something, saved me
climbing up four flights.

6
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:47,304
A man that likes to
talk as much as you do,
l'd think. . .

7
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:52,051
What do you keep coming
up here for, Mr. Adams?

8
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,928
Afraid someone's
going to steal our bell?
(CHUCKLES)

9
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,350
Well, don't worry.

10
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:01,805
Been here more than 1 4 years,
and ain't been carried off
once. (LAUGHS)

11
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,864
Better get yourself
back down to Congress,
Mr. Adams.

12
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:10,025
Getting ready to vote,
and they said

13
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:11,874
they couldn't settle
such an important question

14
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:14,409
without Massachusetts
being there.

15
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:17,872
l can just imagine.

16
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:27,207
All right, what burning issue
are we voting on this time?

17
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:31,218
On whether or not to grant
General Washington's request

18
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:34,682
that all members
of the Rhode lsland Militia
be required

19
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,814
to wear matching uniforms.

20
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:39,977
Oh, good God.

21
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:19,098
l have come to the conclusion

22
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:23,443
that one useless man
is called a disgrace,

23
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:27,732
that two are called
a law firm,

24
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:32,572
and that three or more
become a Congress.

25
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:36,275
And, by God,
l have had this Congress.

26
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,157
For 1 0 years,
King George
and his parliament

27
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:43,665
have gulled, cullied
and diddled these colonies
with their illegal taxes.

28
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:47,749
Stamp Acts, Townshend Acts,
Sugar Acts, Tea Acts.

29
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:50,546
And when we dared
stand up like men,

30
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:53,761
they have stopped our trade,
seized our ships,

31
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:56,684
blockaded our ports,
burned our towns,

32
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,392
and spilled our blood.

33
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,473
And still this Congress
refuses to grant

34
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,809
any of my proposals
on independence

35
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,185
even so much as
the courtesy of
open debate.

36
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,324
Good God, what in the hell
are you waiting for?

37
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:15,493
Sit down, John
Sit down, John

38
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:17,323
Thomas, for God's sake,
listen to me.

39
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,118
For God's sake
John, sit down

40
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:21,161
l've had enough of you, sir.

41
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:22,785
Sit down, John
Sit down, John

42
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,502
For God's sake,
John, sit down

43
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,173
Someone ought to
open up a window

44
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,001
Will you listen to me
and forget the window?

45
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:30,246
lt's 90 degrees

46
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,128
Have mercy, John, please

47
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,514
It's hot as heII
in Philadelphia

48
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:37,092
Someone ought to
open up a window

49
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:39,678
l say vote yes

50
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,564
Vote yes

51
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,850
Vote for independency

52
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:46,524
Someone ought to
open up a window

53
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:48,774
l say vote yes

54
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,766
Sit down, John

55
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,858
Vote for independency

56
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:55,323
Someone ought to
open up a window

57
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:56,404
No, no, no!

58
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,779
Too many flies,
too many flies

59
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,537
But it's hot as heII
in Philadelphia

60
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,660
Are you gonna
open up a window?

61
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,707
Can't we compromise here?

62
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,121
Vote yes

63
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,379
No, too many flies here

64
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,881
Vote yes

65
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:14,672
Oh, for God's sake,
John, sit down

66
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:17,337
Good God.
Consider yourselves fortunate

67
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,426
that you have
John Adams to abuse,

68
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,682
for no sane man
would tolerate it.

69
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,224
John, you're a bore

70
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,177
We've heard this before

71
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,637
Now, for God's sake,
John, sit down

72
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:30,018
l say vote yes
No!

73
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,816
Vote yes
No!

74
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,069
Vote for independency

75
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,151
Someone ought to
open up a window

76
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:38,911
l say vote yes

77
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:41,239
Sit down, John

78
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:44,035
Vote for independency

79
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,250
WiII someone
shut that man up?

80
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,630
Never!

81
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,749
Dear God.

82
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,959
For one solid year
they have been sitting here.

83
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,336
A whole year!

84
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,922
Doing nothing !

85
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,391
l do believe you've laid
a curse on North America

86
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,394
A curse that we here now
rehearse in Philadelphia

87
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,603
A second flood,
a simple famine

88
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,608
Plagues of
locusts everywhere

89
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,570
Or a cataclysmic
earthquake

90
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,611
l'd accept
with some despair

91
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,284
But, no,
you've sent us Congress

92
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,695
Good God, sir,
was that fair?

93
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:39,631
l say this with humility
in Philadelphia

94
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,380
We're your responsibility
in Philadelphia

95
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,641
lf you don't want to
see us hanging
from some far off British hiII

96
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,560
lf you don't want
the voice of independency
forever stiIIed

97
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,061
Then God,
Sir, get thee to it

98
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,228
For Congress never will

99
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,652
You see, we piddle,
twiddIe and resoIve

100
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,565
Not one damn thing
do we soIve

101
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,744
Piddle, twiddle and resolve

102
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,573
Nothing's ever solved

103
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,368
ln foul, fetid, fuming,
foggy, filthy

104
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,714
Philadelphia

105
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,129
Someone ought to
open up a window

106
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,879
Oh, shut up.

107
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,343
MAN 1: l now call Congress'
attention to the petition of
Mr. Melchior Meng,

108
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,514
who claims $20 compensation
for his dead muIe.

109
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,144
It seems
the animal was employed
transporting luggage

110
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,681
in the service of Congress.

111
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,894
MAN 2: The question, then,
would appear to be
one of occasion.

112
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,771
For if the muIe
expired not while carrying,

113
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,105
but after being unloaded,

114
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,653
then clearly
the beast dropped dead
on its own time.

115
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,446
Oh, good God.

116
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,290
They may sit here
for years and years
in Philadelphia

117
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:01,924
These indecisive
grenadiers of Philadelphia

118
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,383
They can't agree on
what is right and wrong
or what is good or bad

119
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,967
I'm convinced
the only purpose
this Congress ever had

120
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,394
was to gather
here specifically

121
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,771
to drive John Adams mad!

122
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,811
You see, we piddle,
twiddIe and resoIve

123
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,734
Not one damn thing
do we soIve

124
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,812
Piddle, twiddle and resolve

125
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,438
Nothing's ever solved

126
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,900
In foul, fetid,
fuming, foggy, filthy

127
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,026
Philadelphia

128
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,912
WOMAN:   John, John

129
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,409
ls that you
carrying on, John?

130
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,788
Oh, Abigail, Abigail,
l have such a desire to
knock heads together.

131
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,424
ABlGAlL: Then why
in heaven's name
do you stay there?

132
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,592
Come home to Boston, John.
lt's only 300 miles.

133
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,262
lf you left tonight,
you could be here
in only eight days.

134
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,591
How can l do that, Abigail?

135
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:57,217
l'm no further along now
than l was
when l first came here.

136
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,265
l know, my dearest. l know.

137
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,269
But that's because you make
everything so complicated.

138
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,142
lt's all quite
simple, really.

139
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,447
Just tell the Congress
to decIare

140
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:10,832
lndependency

141
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,080
Then sign your name
get out of there

142
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:16,752
And hurry home to me

143
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,503
Our chiIdren
all have dysentery

144
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,705
LittIe Tom
keeps turning blue

145
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,706
Little Abby
has the measIes

146
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:26,048
And l'm coming down
with fIu

147
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:29,144
They say
we may get smallpox

148
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,850
Madam, what else is new?

149
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,099
Abigail, in my last letter,
l wrote you

150
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:40,436
that the king had
collected 1 2,000
German mercenaries

151
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:41,863
to send against us.

152
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,941
l asked you to
organize the ladies

153
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:46,447
to make saltpeter
for gunpowder.

154
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,203
Now, have you done
as l asked?

155
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,451
No, John, l have not.

156
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,122
Well, why have you not?

157
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,370
Because you neglected
to tell us
how saltpeter is made.

158
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:58,422
By treating sodium nitrate
with potassium chloride,
of course.

159
00:10:58,499 --> 00:10:59,829
Oh, yes, of course.

160
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,037
Will it be done, then?

161
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,877
John, l'm afraid we have
a more urgent problem.

162
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,633
More urgent, madam?

163
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:10,257
There's one thing
every woman's missed
in Massachusetts Bay

164
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:14,768
Don't smirk at me,
you egotist

165
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:18,641
Pay heed to what l say

166
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,098
We've gone from
Framingham to Boston

167
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:23,069
And we cannot find a pin

168
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,533
"Don't you know
there's a war on"

169
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,650
Say the tradesmen
with a grin

170
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:32,317
Well, we will
not make saltpeter

171
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:36,578
Until you send us pins

172
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:38,834
Pins, madam? Saltpeter.

173
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:39,865
Pins.

174
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:40,957

Hurry home, John.

Franklin !

201
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,521
Where in hell are you?

202
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,189
Franklin !

203
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,689
l see you hiding
behind that tree.

204
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:27,727
lt won't do you any good.

205
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,781
Damn it, this is no time
for playing games.

206
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,817
Franklin,
l have been looking
everywhere for you.

207
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,198
Where in God's name
have you been?

208
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,245
Right here, John,
being preserved
for posterity.

209
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,870
Do you like it?

210
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,245
lt stinks.

211
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:50,917
As ever,
the soul of tact.

212
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,505
Well, the man's
no Botticelli.

213
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,470
And the subject's
no Venus.

214
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,430
Franklin,
where were you last night
when l needed you?

215
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:59,301
You should have heard
what l suffered in there.

216
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:02,808
l heard, all right.
Along with
the rest of Philadelphia.

217
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,642
Lord, your voice
is piercing, John.

218
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,517
Well, l wish to heaven
my arguments were.

219
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:11,154
My God, Franklin,
when are they going to
make up their minds?

220
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,324
With one hand
they can raise an army,

221
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:14,992
dispatch one of
their own to lead it,

222
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,321
and cheer the news
from Bunker's Hill.

223
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:20,156
And with the other,
they wave the olive branch,

224
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:23,293
begging the king for a happy
and permanent reconciliation.

225
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:25,961
Fat George has
declared us in rebellion.

226
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,620
Why in bloody hell
can't they?

227
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,248
John, really? You talk as if
independence were the rule.

228
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,167
lt's never been done before.

229
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:36,166
No colony has ever broken
from the parent stem
in the history of the world.

230
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:39,339
Damn it, Franklin,
you make us sound
treasonous.

231
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:41,008
Do l?

232
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,467
Treason, eh?

233
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:45,892
Treason is a charge
invented by winners

234
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,847
as an excuse for
hanging the losers.

235
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:49,691
l have more to do
than stand here,

236
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,312
listening to you
quote yourself.

237
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,570
No, that was a new one.

238
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:55,861
Damn it, Franklin,
we're at war.

239
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,855
To defend ourselves,
nothing more.

240
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,567
We expressed our displeasure,
the English moved against us,

241
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,118
and we in turn
have resisted.

242
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,621
Now our fellow
congressmen want to
effect a reconciliation

243
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,874
before it becomes a war.

244
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,615
Reconciliation, my ass.

245
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,707
The people want independence.

246
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,752
The people have read
Mr. Paine's Common Sense.

247
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:14,126
l doubt very much
Congress has.

248
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:15,798
That's true.

249
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,671
John, why don't you
give it up?

250
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:20,218
Nobody listens to you.
You're obnoxious
and disliked.

251
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:25,057
l'm not promoting John Adams.
l'm promoting independence.

252
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,351
Evidently, they cannot help
connecting the two.

253
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,807
Even your own cousin.

254
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:33,145
And if Sam Adams
can't put up with you,
nobody can.

255
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:35,821
You're getting at something.

256
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:38,784
How can you tell?

257
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:40,073
All right,
out with it, Franklin.

258
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,656
What new intrigue
are you cooking up?

259
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,156
Let someone else
in Congress propose.

260
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,198
Never!

261
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,995
(SlGHS)

262
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:58,337
Why? Who did you
have in mind?

263
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,634
l don't know.
l really haven't
given it much thought.

264
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,889
You sent for me, Benjamin?

265
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:06,773
Never.

266
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,019
Hello, Johnny!
Richard.

267
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,522
Uh, Johnny and l
need some advice.

268
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:15,022
lf it's mine to give,
it's yours, you know that.

269
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,357
Thank you, Richard.

270
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,032
As you know,
the cause that we support

271
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,940
has come to
a complete standstill.

272
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,909
Now why do you
suppose that is?
Simple.

273
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,531
Johnny here is
obnoxious and disliked.
That's true.

274
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,117
Now, what's the solution,
l wonder?

275
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:31,371
Get somebody else in
Congress to propose.

276
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,077
Oh, Richard,
that's brilliant.

277
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,087
Wasn't that
brilliant, John?
Brilliant.

278
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,379
Yes. Now the question
remains, who can it be?

279
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,763
The man that we need
must belong to a delegation

280
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,720
publicly committed
to support independence.

281
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,471
And at the present time,
only Massachusetts,

282
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,222
New Hampshire
and Delaware have
declared our way.

283
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,684
And Virginia.
Don't forget
Virginia, Benjy.

284
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,385
Oh, Richard, l haven't.
How could l?

285
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,725
But strictly speaking,

286
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,640
while Virginia's views
on independence
are well known,

287
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:53,978
your legislature
in Williamsburg

288
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:55,773
has never
formally authorized

289
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:58,646
its delegation
here in Congress
to support the cause.

290
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,736
Now, if we could
think of a Virginian

291
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,450
with enough influence
to go down there

292
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,160
and persuade
the House of Burgesses. . .

293
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Damn me if l haven't
thought of someone!

294
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,446
Who?
Who?

295
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:09,536
Me.

296
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,160
Oh, why didn't l
think of that?

297
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,787
l'll leave tonight.

298
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:15,423
Why, hell, l'll leave
right now, if you like.

299
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,560
l'll just stop off
in Stratford long enough
to refresh the missus,

300
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:21,103
and then
straight to the matter.

301
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:24,057
Yes, sir.
l really have to compliment
you on your judgment, Johnny.

302
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:25,568
Whoa, boy. Steady.

303
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,440
You've come to the one colony
that can get the job done.

304
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:31,738
Virginia, the land
that gave us our glorious
Commander in Chief,

305
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:33,952
George Washington,

306
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,373
will now give the continent
its proposal on independence.

307
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:40,583
And when Virginia proposes,
the South is bound to follow.

308
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:44,075
And where the South goes,
the middle colonies go.

309
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,208
Gentlemen, a salute.

310
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:49,966
To Virginia,
the mother of
American independence.

311
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:53,339
lncredible. We're free,
and he hasn't even left yet.

312
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:56,008
What makes you so sure
you can do it?

313
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:59,353
My name is
Richard Henry Lee

314
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,274
Virginia is my home

315
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:03,562
My name is
Richard Henry Lee

316
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:06,686
Virginia is my home

317
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:09,284
And may my horses
turn to glue

318
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,190
If I can't deIiver
up to you

319
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,369

320

ln the oldest colony

326
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:34,375
And may the British
burn my land

327
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,429
If I can't deIiver
to your hand

328
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:39,932
A resoIution

You see, it's here a Lee,

A resoIution

345
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:12,264
Spoken modest-Lee.
God help us.

346
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,220
He will, John. He will.

347
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,720
They say that God in heaven
is everybody's God

postponed indefinitely.

688
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:43,742
Judge Wilson,

689
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:47,076
in your eagerness to be loved,
you seem to have forgotten

690
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:50,122
that Pennsylvania
cannot second its own motion.

691
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,251
Delaware seconds.

692
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:55,625
You would, you lousy wart.

693
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:59,341

the resolution
on independency
or proceed with the debate,

all those in favor
of debate say "yea,"

postponement say "nay."

New Hampshire?

700
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:14,731
New Hampshire favors debate,
and says yea.

701
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:19,395
New Hampshire says yea.
Massachusetts?

702
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:24,278
Massachusetts,
having borne the brunt
of the King's tyranny. . .

703

(ALL CLAMORlNG)
Yes, l said tyranny!

Massachusetts now,
and for all time, says yea.

705
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:33,537
Massachusetts says yea.

Where's Rhode lsland?

709
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:42,967
Rhode lsland is out
visiting the necessary.

710
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,600
After what
Rhode lsland's consumed,
l can't say l'm surprised.

711
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,600
We'll come back to him,
Mr. Thomson.

712
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,432

Connecticut?

715
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,990
While Connecticut has,
till now,

716
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,319
been against this proposal,

717
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:06,365
our legislature
has instructed me
that in the event

718
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,660
it is introduced by
any colony outside
of New England,

719
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:13,115
we could not any longer
withhold our support.
Connecticut says yea.

New York
abstains courteously.

00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,422
New York abstains.

724
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:23,547
Courteously.

726
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:28,348

Pennsylvania says nay.
Delaware?

730
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:44,701
Delaware, as ever
for independence, says yea.

731

Delaware says yea.
Maryland?

732
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:51,486
Maryland would
welcome independence
if it were given,

733
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:54,788
but is highly skeptical
that it can be taken.

Mr. President,

741
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,268
although we
of South Carolina have
never seriously considered

742
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:22,567
the question of independence,

743
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:26,491
when a gentleman proposes it,
attention must be paid.

744
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:31,695
However,
we in the Deep South,

745
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:33,735
unlike our friends
in New England,

746
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:37,459
have no cause for impatience
at the present time.

747
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,923
lf at some future date
it becomes the wish of
all our sister colonies,

748
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:45,923
to effect a separation,
we will not stand in the way.

749
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,837
But for the time being,

750
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,136

will wait and watch.

Mr. President,
Georgia seems to be split

756
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,287
right down the middle
on this issue.

757
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:17,199

(ALL LAUGHlNG)

759
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:22,916
However, l'm afraid
l'm not quite certain

760
00:39:23,003 --> 00:39:24,303
whether representing
the people means

761
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:27,129
relying on their judgment
or on my own.

762
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:29,425
ln all fairness,
until l can figure that out,

763
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,929
l'd better lean
a little on their side.

764
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:39,982
Georgia says nay.

765
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:41,601

Well, it won't kill you.

772
00:39:56,988 --> 00:40:00,408
You'd think the Congress
would have its own privy.

773
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:02,412
All right,
where does she stand?

774
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:04,954
Five for debate,
five for postponement,

775
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,408
one abstention
and one absence.

00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:08,168

it couldn't be talked about.

get Mr. Hopkins a rum.

damn barrel if he wants.

this Congress a committee
of the whole

for the purpose of debating
Virginia's resolution
on independence.

Mr. Dickinson.

Well, now,
you've got your way
at last, Mr. Adams.

now be discussed.

l confess
l'm almost relieved.

789
00:40:52,688 --> 00:40:56,188
There's a question
l've been fairly
itching to ask you.

790
00:40:58,569 --> 00:40:59,649
Why?

791
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:01,947
Why what, Mr. Dickinson?

792
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:04,701
Well, why independence,
Mr. Adams?

793
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:08,121
Well, for
the obvious reason that
our continued association

794
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:11,084
with Great Britain
has grown intolerable.

795
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:13,705
Well, to whom,
Mr. Adams? To you?

796
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:17,628
Well, then l suggest
you sever your ties
immediately.

797
00:41:17,713 --> 00:41:22,933
But please be kind enough
to leave the rest
of us where we are.

798
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,719
For myself,
l have no objection at all

the greatest empire
on Earth,

800

and sharing its benefits.

00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:32,894
Benefits?

802
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:35,555
What benefits?

803
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:39,442
Crippling taxes?
Cruel repressions?

804
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:41,147
Abolished rights?

00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:46,825
ls that all England
means to you, sir?

806
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:52,163

affection you can muster

807
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,668
for the nation
that bore you?

808
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,500
For the noblest,
most civilized nation
on the face of this planet?

809
00:41:58,587 --> 00:42:02,217
Well, would you
have us forsake
Hastings and Magna Carta,

810
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:05,889
Strongbow and Lionheart,
Drake and Marlborough,

811

Tudors, Stuarts
and Plantagenets?

812
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:09,675
For what, sir?

813
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:11,765
Well, tell me. For what?

814
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,270
For you?

815
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,895
Some men are patriots,
like General Washington,

816
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:26,198
and some are anarchists,
like Mr. Paine.

817
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:29,032
Some even are
internationalists,
like Dr. Franklin.

818
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:31,658
But you, sir. . .

819
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:36,039
You are merely an agitator,

820
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,535
disturbing the peace,

821
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:40,086

endangering
the public welfare.

822
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:41,551

00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,920

personal complaints.

824
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:46,048

Come, come, Mr. Adams.

827
00:42:57,104 --> 00:43:00,484
lf you have grievances,
and l'm sure you have,

828
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:02,316
our present system
must provide

829
00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:04,071
a gentler means
of redressing them

830
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:06,153
short of revolution.

831
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:09,242
Yes, that's what he wants.

832
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:11,235
Nothing less
will satisfy him.

833
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:14,117
Violence, rebellion,
treason.

834
00:43:16,624 --> 00:43:18,674
Now, Mr. Adams,

835
00:43:19,835 --> 00:43:22,995
are these
the acts of Englishmen?

836
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:25,628
Not Englishmen, Dickinson.
Americans.

837
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:27,676
No, sir. Englishmen !

838
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:30,429
Please, Mr. Dickinson,
must you start banging?

839
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:31,763
How is a man to sleep?

840
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:36,809
Forgive me, Dr. Franklin,
but must you start speaking?

841
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:38,984
How is a man to stay awake?

to be quiet, sir.

l assure you l prefer
l'd remained asleep.

847
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:54,286
Oh, now, what's so terrible
about being called
an Englishman?

848
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,910
The English
don't seem to mind.

Nor would l,
were l given the full
rights of an Englishman.

850
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:03,668
But to call me one
without those rights
is like calling an ox a bull.

He's thankful for the honor,

852

rather have restored
what's rightfully his.

When did you first notice
they were missing, sir?

Higher, certainly,
than she feels for them.

00:44:31,907 --> 00:44:33,657
Never was such
a valuable possession

859
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:36,122
so stupidly
and so recklessly managed

860
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:39,123
than this entire continent
by the British Crown.

861
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:42,376
Our industry discouraged,
our resources pillaged.

862
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:46,417
Worst of all,
our very character stifled.

863
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:49,339
We've spawned
a new race here,
Mr. Dickinson.

864
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:50,755
Rougher, simpler,

865
00:44:50,843 --> 00:44:53,473
more violent,
more enterprising,

866
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:55,014
less refined.

867
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:57,389
We're a new nationality.

868
00:44:57,474 --> 00:44:59,604
We require a new nation.

869
00:45:02,896 --> 00:45:03,976
Well,

870
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:07,233
that may be your opinion,
Dr. Franklin,

871
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:12,778
but, as l said,
the people feel
quite differently.

872
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:16,235
Now, what do you know
about the people, Dickinson?

873
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:19,907
You don't
speak for the people.
You represent only yourself.

874
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:22,077
And that precious status quo

875
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:25,536
you keep imploring
the people to preserve
for their own good

876
00:45:25,628 --> 00:45:29,758
is nothing more than
the eternal preservation
of your own property.

877
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,050
Mr. Adams,
you have an annoying talent

878
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:36,216
for making such
delightful words

879
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:39,515
as "property" sound
quite distasteful.

880
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,520
ln heaven's name,
what's wrong with property?

881
00:45:43,228 --> 00:45:46,358
Perhaps you've forgotten
that many of us first came
to these shores

882
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,070
in order to secure
rights to property,

883
00:45:49,151 --> 00:45:53,401
and that we hold these rights
no less dear than
the rights you speak of.

884
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:56,279
Yes. So safe, so fat,

885
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:57,947
so comfortable
in Pennsylvania.

886
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:00,405
And what is this
independence of yours

887
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:03,206
except the private grievance
of Massachusetts?

888
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,000
Why is it always Boston
that breaks the King's peace?

889
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:10,455
My dear Congress,
you must not adopt
this evil measure.

890
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,757
lt is the work of the devil.

891
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:15,181
Leave it where it belongs.

892
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:17,431
ln New England.

893
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:19,353
Brother Dickinson,
New England has been

894
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:21,181
fighting the devil
for more than 1 00 years.

895
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:23,555
And as of now,
Brother Sherman,

896
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:26,444
the devil has been
winning hands down.

897
00:46:27,106 --> 00:46:30,436
Why, at this very moment,
he's sitting right
here in this Congress.

898
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:34,356
Don't let him deceive you.
This proposal is
entirely his doing.

899
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:36,106
lt may bear Virginia's name,

900
00:46:36,198 --> 00:46:40,118
but it reeks of Adams,
Adams and more Adams.

901
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:42,792
Look at him.
Ready to lead this continent

902
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:45,501
down the fiery path
of total destruction.

903
00:46:45,582 --> 00:46:49,712
Oh, good God !
Why can't you acknowledge
what already exists?

904
00:46:49,795 --> 00:46:53,295
lt has been more than a year
since Concord and Lexington.

905
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:55,682
Damn it, man,
we're at war, right now!

906
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:59,009
You may be at war.
You, Boston and John Adams.

907
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:01,716
But you will never
speak for Pennsylvania.

908
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:02,847
Nor for Delaware.

909
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:07,313
Mr. Read, you represent
only one-third of Delaware.

910
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:09,476
The sensible third,
Mr. Rodney.

911
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:12,725
Sit down, you scurvy dog,
or l'll knock you down.

912
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:14,989
(DOG BARKlNG)
Sit down, all three of you !

913
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,070
McNair, do something
about that damn dog !

914
00:47:17,156 --> 00:47:18,656
And here, fetch me a rum.

915
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:20,831
Get that dog first!
Rum, rum !

916
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,699
l only got two hands.

917
00:47:23,203 --> 00:47:24,753
(ALL CLAMORlNG)

918
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,251
Christ, it's hot!

919
00:47:41,638 --> 00:47:43,678
Please do go on, gentlemen.

920
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:46,056
You're making the only breeze
in Philadelphia.

921
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:49,151
Mr. Adams,

922
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:52,733
perhaps you could
clear up something for me?

923
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,530
After we have
achieved independence,

924
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:58,281
who do you propose
would govern in
South Carolina?

925
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:01,623
The people, of course.

926
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:04,989
Which people, sir?
The people of South Carolina

927
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,410
or the people
of Massachusetts?

928
00:48:07,748 --> 00:48:09,248
Why don't you
admit it, Neddy?

929
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:12,253
You're against
independence now
and you always will be.

930
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:13,626
Aye.

931
00:48:15,756 --> 00:48:19,336
Gentlemen,
you refuse to understand us.

932
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:22,176
We desire independence. Yes.

933
00:48:23,138 --> 00:48:25,848
For South Carolina.
That is our country.

934
00:48:27,142 --> 00:48:30,232
And as such, we don't
wish to belong to anyone.

935
00:48:30,312 --> 00:48:32,982
Not to England
and not to you.

936
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:36,779
We intend to have
one nation, Rutledge.

937
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,070
A nation of
sovereign states, Mr. Adams.

938
00:48:40,155 --> 00:48:42,235
United for our
mutual protection,

939
00:48:42,324 --> 00:48:45,744
but separate for
our individual pursuits.

940
00:48:45,828 --> 00:48:48,788
Now, that is what
we have understood it to be,

941
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:51,672
and that is what
we will support.

942
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:55,668
As soon as
everyone supports it.

943
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:02,005
Well, there you are,
Mr. Adams.

944
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:05,103
You must see
that we need time.

945
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:07,807
Time to make certain
who we are

946
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:10,641
and where we stand
in regard to one another.

947
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:14,687
For if we do not determine
the nature of the beast
before we set it free,

948
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:17,443
it will end
by consuming us all.

949
00:49:17,526 --> 00:49:19,736
For once
in your life, Wilson,

950
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:22,196
take a chance.

951
00:49:23,824 --> 00:49:25,704
l say the time is now.

952
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:28,829
lt may never come again.

953
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,160
Your clock is fast,
Mr. Adams.

954
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:33,328
l say we're not yet ripe
for independence.

955
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:36,752
Not ripe?
Hell, we're rotting
for want of it.

956
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:41,217
Gentlemen, please,
what in God's name
is the infernal hurry?

957
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,300
Why must this question
be settled now?

958
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:45,635
What's wrong with now,
Mr. Chase?

959
00:49:45,888 --> 00:49:48,098
General Washington
is in the field.

960
00:49:48,181 --> 00:49:50,141
lf he's defeated,
as it now appears,

961
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:52,305
we'll be inviting
the hangman.

962
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:56,484
But if, by some miracle,
he should actually win,

963
00:49:56,565 --> 00:49:59,275
we can then declare
anything we damn please.

964
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,189
The sentiments of
North Carolina precisely.

965
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:05,025
Has it ever
occurred to either of you

966
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:09,575
that an army needs
something to fight for
in order to win?

967
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:13,155
A purpose? A goal?
A flag of its own?

968
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:14,964
Mr. Adams,

969
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:18,746
how can a nation of
only 2 million souls

970
00:50:18,837 --> 00:50:21,207
stand up to an empire
of 1 0 million?

971
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:22,718
Think of it. 1 0 million.

972
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:25,129
How do we compensate
for that shortage?

973
00:50:25,218 --> 00:50:27,928
lt's simple, Mr. Chase.
lncrease and multiply.

974
00:50:28,013 --> 00:50:30,143
How's that?
(ALL LAUGHlNG)

975
00:50:30,724 --> 00:50:33,524
We will more than
compensate with spirit.

976
00:50:33,894 --> 00:50:36,694
l tell you, there is
a spirit out there
among the people

977
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:38,862
that is sadly lacking
in this Congress.

978
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:41,981
Yes, of course.
Now it's spirit.

979
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:44,069
Well, why didn't
l think of that?

980
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:48,284
No army, no navy,
no arms, no ammunition,

981
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:52,657
no treasury, no friends,

982
00:50:52,746 --> 00:50:55,826
but, bless our soul, spirit.

983
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:59,253
Mr. Lee, Mr. Hopkins,

984
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,746
Mr. Rodney, Colonel McKean,

985
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:03,338
Dr. Franklin.

986
00:51:04,633 --> 00:51:08,933
Why have you joined
this incendiary little man,

987
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,760
this Boston radical,

988
00:51:13,058 --> 00:51:14,558
this agitator,

989
00:51:15,936 --> 00:51:17,476
this demagogue,

990
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,650
this madman?

991
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:22,231
Are you calling me
a madman, you. . .

992
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:24,895
You fribble!

993
00:51:27,072 --> 00:51:29,992
You and your
Pennsylvania proprietors,

994
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:33,035
oh, you cool,
considerate men,

995
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,290
you hang to the rear
on every issue,

996
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:38,752
so that
if we should go under,
you'll still remain afloat.

997
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:40,674
Are you calling me a coward?

998
00:51:41,336 --> 00:51:42,996
Yes. Coward !

999
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:44,764
Madman !

1000
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,920
Landlord !

1001
00:51:46,008 --> 00:51:47,258
Lawyer!

1002
00:51:53,724 --> 00:51:55,684
Stop it! Stop it!

1003
00:51:57,477 --> 00:52:00,767
This is the Congress.
Stop it, l say!

1004
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:02,106
The enemy's out there.

1005
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,860
No, Mr. Rodney,
the enemy is here.

1006
00:52:03,942 --> 00:52:06,782
No. l say he's out there.

1007
00:52:06,862 --> 00:52:08,492
England.

1008
00:52:08,572 --> 00:52:12,072
England closing in,
cutting off our air.

1009
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,739
There's no time!

1010
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,540
No air.

1011
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:21,165
Dr. Hall.

1012
00:52:25,255 --> 00:52:26,755
Colonel McKean.

1013
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,630
Aye. lt's the cancer.

1014
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,640
But he should go home.

1015
00:52:32,637 --> 00:52:35,847
A man should die
in his own bed.

1016
00:52:37,517 --> 00:52:39,727
John. John Adams.

1017
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:41,441
l'm here, Caesar.

1018
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:46,322
l leave you

1019
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:48,691
a divided Delaware.

1020
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:51,316
Forgive me.

1021
00:52:52,032 --> 00:52:54,122
l'll take you home,
Caesar.

1022
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,144
l'll be back
within the week.

1023
00:53:28,735 --> 00:53:32,145
Mr. President,
South Carolina
calls the question.

1024
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:35,409
What's that, Mr. Rutledge?

1025
00:53:36,618 --> 00:53:38,658
l said, Mr. President,

1026
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:42,155
South Carolina desires
to end the debate

1027
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:46,212
and calls the question
of independence.

1028
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:47,384

the resolution again?

We've been looking
for you everywhere,

Someone told us
that you might be

suggested Library Hall,

why does New York
constantly abstain?

Why doesn't New York
simply stay in New York?

who opposes independence

on the side of England?

1129

That we'll be setting
brother against brother,

1130
00:58:24,572 --> 00:58:28,412
that our new nation
will carry as its emblem
the mark of Cain.

luck l had with it.

1144
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:02,026
Mr. Adams is right.
We need a postponement.

1145
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,110
On what grounds?

1146
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:09,945
Mr. President,
how can this Congress
vote on independence

1147
00:59:10,034 --> 00:59:14,914
without a written declaration
of some sort defining it?

1148
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:18,544
What sort of declaration?

1149
00:59:20,128 --> 00:59:24,208
Ah, well, you know,
listing the reasons
for the separation,

1150
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:27,299
our purposes, goals,
so forth, so on.

1151
00:59:27,385 --> 00:59:28,385
Ditto, Ditto.

00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:31,346
We know those, don't we?

1154
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:35,813
Oh, yes, good God,
we know them,

1155
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:39,061
but what about
the rest of the world?

1156
00:59:39,147 --> 00:59:41,567
Certainly we require
the assistance

1157
00:59:41,649 --> 00:59:45,239
of a powerful nation
such as France or Spain.

1158
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,900
And such
a written declaration

1159
00:59:46,988 --> 00:59:49,818
would be consistent
with European delicacy.

1160
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:54,576
Come now, Mr. Adams.
You'll have to do
better than that.

1161

What would be its purpose?

1162

Yes. Well. . .

1163
01:00:03,421 --> 01:00:07,551
To place before mankind
the common sense
of the subject

1164

in terms so plain and firm

1165

(CHUCKLlNG)

1167
01:00:21,606 --> 01:00:24,776
Mr. Jefferson,
are you seriously suggesting

1168
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:27,819
that we publish a paper
declaring to all the world

1169
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:32,204
that an illegal rebellion
is, in reality, a legal one?

1170
01:00:32,283 --> 01:00:35,123
Mr. Dickinson,
l'm surprised at you.

1171
01:00:35,203 --> 01:00:37,963
You should know that
rebellion is always legal
in the first person,

1172
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,749
such as "our rebellion."

1173
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:40,962
lt's only
in the third person,

1174
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:42,792
"their rebellion,"
that it is illegal.

1175
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:47,298

l second the motion

1176

to postpone the vote
on independence

1177
01:00:49,217 --> 01:00:53,047

sufficient for
the writing of a declaration.

goes on in New York?

1188
01:01:29,882 --> 01:01:33,432
l'm sorry, Mr. President,
but the simple fact is that

1189
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:37,931
our legislature has
never sent us explicit
instructions on anything.

1190
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:40,135
Never?

1191
01:01:41,477 --> 01:01:43,147
That's impossible.

1195
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:55,279
and nobody listens
to anybody else

1196
01:01:55,366 --> 01:01:58,286
with the result that
nothing ever gets done.

1197
01:02:00,872 --> 01:02:02,962
l beg the Congress' pardon.

1198
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:07,291
My sympathies, Mr. Morris.

1199
01:02:07,962 --> 01:02:11,722
The vote again being tied,
the chair decides in favor
of postponement.

1200
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:13,549
So ruled.

1201
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:15,715
A committee
will now be formed to
manage the declaration.

1202
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:18,763
Said document to be written,
debated, approved by
the beginning of July,

1203
01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:20,598
some three weeks hence.

1204
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:23,023
At which time,
Virginia's resolution

1205
01:02:23,102 --> 01:02:25,562
on independence
will finally be voted.

1206
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,147
ls that clear?
(SOUNDS OF APPROVAL)

1207
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:29,612
Very well. Will
the following gentlemen

1208
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:31,232
serve on
the Declaration Committee,

1209
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:33,069
Dr. Franklin?
Gladly.

1210
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:35,316
Mr. John Adams?
Yes.

1211
01:02:35,448 --> 01:02:36,528
Mr. Sherman?

1212
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:39,333
Mr. Livingston?
Right.

1213
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,290
And, of course, Mr. Lee.

1214
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:43,909
Oh, excuse me,
but l must be returning

1215
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:45,618
to the sovereign
colony of Virginia

1216
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:48,128
as l have been asked
to serve as governor.

1217
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:51,841
And therefore l must
decline respectful-Lee.

1218
01:02:53,466 --> 01:02:55,126
(LAUGHlNG)

1219
01:02:56,678 --> 01:02:58,798
Very well, Mr. Lee,
you're excused then.

1220
01:02:58,888 --> 01:03:01,388
l suppose we could leave it
a four-man committee.

1221
01:03:01,474 --> 01:03:03,774
Just a moment.
This business
needs a Virginian.

1222
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:05,481
Therefore l propose
a replacement.

1223
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:07,351
Mr. Thomas Jefferson.
No. Mr. Adams. . .

1224
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:09,608
Very well, Mr. Adams.
Mr. Jefferson will serve.

1225
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:11,271
l'm going home, too,
to my wife.

1226
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,359
Move to adjourn !

1227
01:03:12,443 --> 01:03:13,533
Wait.
l second.

1228
01:03:13,611 --> 01:03:17,281
Mr. Hancock,
l haven't seen her
for six months.

1229
01:03:17,365 --> 01:03:19,235
Moved and seconded.
Any objections?

1230
01:03:19,325 --> 01:03:21,405
l have objections.
l have lots of objections.

1231
01:03:21,494 --> 01:03:23,704
So ruled !
Congress stands adjourned !

1232
01:03:23,788 --> 01:03:26,118
John, l need to see my wife.

1233
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,827
lt's all right.
Come along, come along.

1234
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:29,877
No. l'm going
home tonight.

1235
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:31,551
Of course you are.
Of course.

1236
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:34,509
McNair, some rum
up to my office.

1237
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:38,046
Oh, don't worry, Tom.

1238
01:03:38,136 --> 01:03:39,796
Let me handle it.

1239
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:41,717
l'll get Adams to write it.

1240
01:03:41,806 --> 01:03:44,176
l don't know.
He had a funny look
on his face.

1241
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:45,387
He always does.

1242
01:03:45,476 --> 01:03:46,766
JOHN: All right,
gentlemen,

1243
01:03:46,853 --> 01:03:48,443
let's get on with it.

1244
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:51,521
Which of us will
write our Declaration
of lndependence?

1245
01:03:53,192 --> 01:03:56,192
Mr. Adams,
l say you should write it

1246
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:59,701
To your legal mind
and briIIiance we defer

1247
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:03,032
Is that so?
Well, if I'm the one to do it

1248
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,999
They'll run their
quill pens through it

1249
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:07,579
I'm obnoxious and disIiked
You know that, sir

1250
01:04:07,665 --> 01:04:08,665
Yes, I know

1251
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,460
But l say you should
write it, Franklin, yes you

1252
01:04:11,544 --> 01:04:12,634
HeII no!

1253
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:15,302
Yes, you, Dr. Franklin, you

1254
01:04:15,381 --> 01:04:17,511
But...
You!

1255
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,132
But...

1256
01:04:21,262 --> 01:04:24,472
Mr. Adams, but, Mr. Adams

1257
01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:28,192
The things l write
are only light extemporanea

1258
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:32,149
l won't put politics
on paper, it's a mania

1259
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:36,071
So l refuse to use the pen
in Pennsylvania

1260
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:40,032
Pennsylvania

1261
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:43,454
Refuse to use the pen

1262
01:04:54,712 --> 01:04:58,092
Mr. Sherman,
l say you should write it

1263
01:04:58,174 --> 01:05:00,884
You are never
controversiaI as it were

1264
01:05:00,968 --> 01:05:02,008
That is true

1265
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:04,144
Whereas if
I'm the one to do it

1266
01:05:04,222 --> 01:05:05,932
They'll run their
quill pens through it

1267
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:08,385
I'm obnoxious and disIiked
You know that, sir

1268
01:05:08,476 --> 01:05:09,476
Yes, I do

1269
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,060
So l say you should
write it, Roger, yes, you

1270
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:13,396
Good heavens, no

1271
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:15,521
Yes, you, Roger Sherman

1272
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:20,198
You!
But...

1273
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:25,159
Mr. Adams, but, Mr. Adams

1274
01:05:25,243 --> 01:05:29,043
I cannot write
with any style
or proper etiquette

1275
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:32,581
I don't know
a participle from a predicate

1276
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:35,667
l am just a simple cobbler
from Connecticut

1277
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:40,086
Connecticut

1278
01:05:40,174 --> 01:05:43,934
A simple cobbler, he

1279
01:05:52,228 --> 01:05:53,398
Ah.

1280
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:58,017
Mr. Livingston,
maybe you should write it

1281
01:05:58,109 --> 01:06:00,739
You have many friends
and you're a diplomat

1282
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,820
Oh, that word

1283
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:03,824
Whereas if
I'm the one to do it

1284
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:05,486
They'll run their
quill pens through it

1285
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:07,985
He's obnoxious and disIiked
Did you know that?

1286
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,117
I hadn't heard

1287
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:11,753
So l say you should
write it, Robert, yes, you

1288
01:06:11,873 --> 01:06:12,913
Not me, Johnny

1289
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:15,129
Yes, you, Robert Livingston

1290
01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:20,839
You!
But...

1291
01:06:22,008 --> 01:06:25,298
Mr. Adams, dear Mr. Adams

1292
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:28,966
l've been presented
with a new son
by the noble stork

1293
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:32,516
So l am going home
to celebrate and pop the cork

1294
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:36,522
With aII
the Livingstons together
back in oId New York

1295
01:06:36,606 --> 01:06:40,356
New York

1296
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:46,283
Livingston's
going to pop a cork

1297
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:58,964
Mr. Adams

1298
01:06:59,045 --> 01:07:02,455
Leave me aIone

1299
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:06,677
Mr. Jefferson. . .
Mr. Adams, l beg of you.

1300
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:10,221
l've not seen my wife
these past six months.

1301
01:07:10,306 --> 01:07:13,806
"And we solemnly declare
that we will
preserve our liberties,

1302
01:07:13,893 --> 01:07:18,733
"being with one mind
resolved to die free men
rather than to live slaves."

1303
01:07:18,814 --> 01:07:23,784
Thomas Jefferson,
"On the Necessity of
Taking Up Arms," 1 775.

1304
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:25,031
Magnificent.

1305
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,870
You write 1 0 times better
than any man in Congress,

1306
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,660
including me.

1307
01:07:30,743 --> 01:07:32,833
For a man of only 33 years,

1308
01:07:32,912 --> 01:07:36,502
you possess a happy talent
for composition

1309
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:39,462
and a remarkable felicity
of expression.

1310
01:07:40,252 --> 01:07:43,382
Now, then, sir.
Will you be a patriot

1311
01:07:43,464 --> 01:07:44,804
or a lover?

1312
01:07:46,509 --> 01:07:47,759
A lover.

1313
01:07:48,552 --> 01:07:50,052
No.

1314
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:52,177
But l burn, Mr. A.

1315
01:07:52,264 --> 01:07:54,434
So do l, Mr. J.

1316
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:56,937
You?
You do?

1317
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:58,519
John.
Who'd have thought it?

1318
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:02,573
Mr. Jefferson

1319
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,990
Dear Mr. Jefferson

1320
01:08:05,736 --> 01:08:10,736
l'm only 41 ,
l still have my virility

1321
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:16,162
And l can romp
through Cupid's grove
with great agility

1322
01:08:17,498 --> 01:08:22,748
But Iife is more than
sexual combustibility

1323
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:23,917
Jefferson, stop right there.

1324
01:08:24,005 --> 01:08:27,255
'Bustability

1325
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:28,761
CombustibiIi...

1326
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:30,183
Quiet!

1327
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:36,635
Now, you'll write it, Mr. J.

1328
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:39,194
Who will make me, Mr. A.?

1329
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:41,104
l.

1330
01:08:42,023 --> 01:08:43,113
You?

1331
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:44,861
Yes.

1332
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:50,028
How?

1333
01:08:51,824 --> 01:08:54,704
By physical force,
if necessary.

1334
01:08:55,703 --> 01:08:58,373
lt's your duty, damn it.
Your duty!

1335
01:09:00,624 --> 01:09:02,924
Mr. Adams

1336
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:05,252
Damn you, Mr. Adams

1337
01:09:06,464 --> 01:09:09,224
You're obnoxious
and disIiked

1338
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,630
That cannot be denied

1339
01:09:12,344 --> 01:09:18,314
Once again
you stand between
me and my lovely bride

1340
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:21,902
Lovely bride

1341
01:09:23,647 --> 01:09:28,987
Oh, Mr. Adams,
you are driving me
to homicide

1342
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,150
Jefferson, stop right there!

1343
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:31,237
Homicide

1344
01:09:31,322 --> 01:09:32,322
Homicide

1345
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:33,866
Quiet!

1346
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:41,248
The decision is yours,
Mr. Jefferson.

1347
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:43,252
Do as you like with it.

1348
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:53,894
We may see murder yet

1349
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:04,345
Damn the man.

1350
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:08,936
God damn the man.

1351
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:58,026
Sorry.

1352
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:03,620
Pardon me, sir.
Step aside. Step aside.

1353
01:11:04,456 --> 01:11:06,326
How are you?
Franklin.

1354
01:11:12,965 --> 01:11:18,845
Jefferson !

1355
01:11:21,307 --> 01:11:22,597
What is that racket?

1356
01:11:22,683 --> 01:11:24,773
Latest thing
from Europe, John.
lt's called music.

1357
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:28,312
l came here
hoping to hear a pen
scratching, not a bow.

1358
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:33,111
Jefferson !
l know you're in there!

1359
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,410
Ah ! Jefferson,
are you finished?

1360
01:11:39,366 --> 01:11:41,366
Well, is it written yet?

1361
01:11:44,246 --> 01:11:46,786
Well, you've had
a whole week, man.

1362
01:11:46,874 --> 01:11:48,254
ls it done?

1363
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:51,462
Can l see it?

1364
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:01,513
"There comes a time
in the lives of men
when it becomes necessary

1365
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:03,307
"to advance from
that subordination

1366
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:04,810
"in which they
have hitherto. . ."

1367
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:06,562
This is terrible.

1368
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:08,228
Where's the rest of it?

1369
01:12:14,526 --> 01:12:17,896
Do you mean to say
that it is not yet finished?

1370
01:12:18,822 --> 01:12:19,992
No, sir.

1371
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:22,704
l mean to say that
it's not yet begun.

1372
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:24,950
Good God !

1373
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:27,748
A whole week.

1374
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:31,924
The entire Earth
was created in a week.

1375
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:39,129
Someday you must tell me
how you did it.

1376
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:43,929
Disgusting.

1377
01:12:44,848 --> 01:12:46,428
Look at him, Franklin.

1378
01:12:46,517 --> 01:12:48,727
Virginia's most famous lover.

1379
01:12:49,645 --> 01:12:51,305
Virginia abstains.

1380
01:12:55,317 --> 01:12:57,147
Well, cheer up, Jefferson.

1381
01:12:57,236 --> 01:12:59,146
Get out of the dumps.
lt'll come out all right,
l assure you.

1382
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:01,608
Now, get back to work.

1383
01:13:02,366 --> 01:13:04,986
Franklin, tell him to
get back to work.

1384
01:13:05,077 --> 01:13:06,827
l think he's asleep.

1385
01:13:07,663 --> 01:13:08,793
(SNORlNG)

1386
01:13:09,915 --> 01:13:11,575
Wake up, Franklin !

1387
01:13:15,921 --> 01:13:19,131
Hello! And whose
little girl are you?

1388
01:13:22,928 --> 01:13:24,718
John, who is she?

1389
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:26,215
JOHN: His wife.

1390
01:13:27,308 --> 01:13:28,468
l hope.

1391
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:31,689
What makes you think so?

1392
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,650
Because l sent for her.

1393
01:13:34,773 --> 01:13:35,823
You what?

1394
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:37,069
Well, it simply
occurred to me that

1395
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:38,441
the sooner his problem
was solved,

1396
01:13:38,527 --> 01:13:40,567
the sooner our problem
is solved.

1397
01:13:40,654 --> 01:13:43,414
That's good thinking, John.
Good thinking.

1398
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:46,490
Madam, may l present myself?
John Adams.

1399
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:50,658
Adams.

1400
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:53,713
John Adams.

1401
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:57,172
Oh, and Dr. Franklin.

1402
01:13:59,465 --> 01:14:01,585
The inventor of the stove.

1403
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:09,020
Jefferson, kindly
present me to your wife.

1404
01:14:11,894 --> 01:14:13,904
She is your wife, isn't she?

1405
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:15,729
Well, of course she is.
Look at the way they fit.

1406
01:14:19,026 --> 01:14:20,356
Come along, John,
come along.

1407
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:21,944
Franklin,
where are you going?

1408
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:23,109
Come along, John.

1409
01:14:23,697 --> 01:14:25,527
Come along where?
There's work to be done.

1410
01:14:25,616 --> 01:14:26,946
Obviously.

1411
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:30,749
Good God. You don't
mean to say that. . .

1412
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:34,287
l mean,
they're not going to. . .

1413
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:37,714
ln the middle of
the afternoon?

1414
01:14:37,795 --> 01:14:40,205
Not everybody's
from Boston, John.

1415
01:14:41,382 --> 01:14:43,132
lncredible.

1416
01:14:43,217 --> 01:14:45,797
Well, goodbye, John.
Uh. . . Uh. . .

1417
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:47,386
Franklin?

1418
01:14:48,514 --> 01:14:50,314
Have you eaten?
Not yet, but. . .

1419
01:14:50,391 --> 01:14:52,311
l understand
the turkey's fresh
at Bunch of Grapes.

1420
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:55,479
Well, the fact is
l have a rendezvous, John.

1421
01:14:55,562 --> 01:14:58,732
l'd ask you along,
but talking
makes her nervous.

1422
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:02,993
Yes, of course.

1423
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,260
lncredible.

1424
01:15:25,509 --> 01:15:26,629
(SCOFFS)

1425
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:33,516
Abigail?

1426
01:15:34,852 --> 01:15:36,852
l'm very lonely, Abigail.

1427
01:15:37,604 --> 01:15:38,984
Are you, John?

1428
01:15:39,064 --> 01:15:40,774
As long as you were
sending for wives,

1429
01:15:40,858 --> 01:15:42,528
why didn't you
send for your own?

1430
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:45,529
Oh, now, don't be
unreasonable, Abigail.

1431
01:15:45,612 --> 01:15:47,452
Now I'm unreasonabIe.

1432
01:15:47,781 --> 01:15:50,121
You must add that
to your list.

1433
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:52,695
List?

1434
01:15:52,786 --> 01:15:55,956
The catalog of my faults
you included
in your last letter.

1435
01:15:57,583 --> 01:16:01,173
Oh, they were fondly
intended, madam.

1436
01:16:01,253 --> 01:16:02,883
That l play at cards badly?

1437
01:16:02,963 --> 01:16:04,383
A compliment.

1438
01:16:04,465 --> 01:16:06,255
That my posture is crooked?

1439
01:16:06,884 --> 01:16:08,894
An endearment.

1440
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:10,849
That l read,
write and think too much?

1441
01:16:10,929 --> 01:16:12,969
An irony.

1442
01:16:13,056 --> 01:16:14,426
That l'm pigeon-toed?

1443
01:16:17,102 --> 01:16:19,522
Well, now
there you have me, Abby.

1444
01:16:21,148 --> 01:16:23,018
l'm afraid you are
pigeon-toed.

1445
01:16:25,444 --> 01:16:29,364
Please. Come to Philadelphia.
Please come.

1446
01:16:29,907 --> 01:16:32,027
Oh, thank you, John.

1447
01:16:32,117 --> 01:16:34,577
l do want to,
but you know now
it's not possible.

1448
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:35,831
The children
have the measles.

1449
01:16:36,622 --> 01:16:38,082
So you wrote.

1450
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,253
Tom and little Abby.

1451
01:16:41,793 --> 01:16:44,173
Only now it's
Quincy and Charles.

1452
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:49,840
And it appears the farm
here in Braintree
is failing, John.

1453
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,970
The chickens and the geese
have all died.

1454
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:57,481
The apples never survived
the late frost.

1455
01:16:59,228 --> 01:17:02,058
How do you suppose
she managed to get away?

1456
01:17:03,106 --> 01:17:05,896
Well, the winters
are softer in Virginia.

1457
01:17:06,485 --> 01:17:08,355
And their women, John?

1458
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,860
Fit for Virginians, madam,

1459
01:17:10,948 --> 01:17:14,278
but pale, puny things
beside New England girls.

1460
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,080
John.

1461
01:17:17,871 --> 01:17:19,661
l thank you for that.

1462
01:17:23,627 --> 01:17:26,207
Abigail,
how goes it with you?

1463
01:17:26,797 --> 01:17:29,007
Not well, John.
Not at all well.

1464
01:17:30,342 --> 01:17:33,932
I Iive Iike
a nun in a cIoister

1465
01:17:34,012 --> 01:17:38,142
Solitary, celibate
I hate it

1466
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:39,975
And you, John?
Ugh !

1467
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:44,190
I Iive Iike a monk
in an abbey

1468
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:46,693
Ditto, ditto
I hate it

1469
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:55,030
Write to me
with sentimentaI effusion

1470
01:17:56,076 --> 01:18:02,746
Let me reveI
in romantic iIIusion

1471
01:18:04,751 --> 01:18:11,471
Do you still smell of
vanilla and spring air?

1472
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:16,970
And is my
favorite lover's pillow

1473
01:18:17,055 --> 01:18:20,425
StiII firm and fair?

1474
01:18:21,643 --> 01:18:27,023
What was there, John

1475
01:18:27,107 --> 01:18:33,737
Still is there, John

1476
01:18:34,906 --> 01:18:39,036
Come soon as you can
to my cloister

1477
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:43,499
l've forgotten
the feel of your hand

1478
01:18:43,957 --> 01:18:48,667
Soon, madam, we shall walk
in Cupid's grove together

1479
01:18:48,754 --> 01:18:55,094
And we'll fondly survey
And we'll fondly survey

1480
01:18:55,177 --> 01:19:01,557
That promised land
That promised land

1481
01:19:02,559 --> 01:19:06,979
Till then, till then
Till then, till then

1482
01:19:07,064 --> 01:19:12,654
I am as I ever was
I am as I ever was

1483
01:19:12,736 --> 01:19:17,236
And ever shaII be
And ever shaII be

1484
01:19:17,324 --> 01:19:31,254
Yours
Yours

1485
01:19:31,838 --> 01:19:34,008
Saltpeter

1486
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:38,215
John

1487
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:49,691
John?

1488
01:19:49,773 --> 01:19:50,773
John !
Hmm?

1489
01:19:50,857 --> 01:19:51,937
What?

1490
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:52,975
What are you doing
down here?

1491
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:55,028
l thought you'd be up there,
cracking the whip.

1492
01:19:55,112 --> 01:19:58,412
Oh, well, the shutters
are still closed.

1493
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,530
My word ! So they are.

1494
01:20:03,912 --> 01:20:05,042
Well, as the French say. . .

1495
01:20:05,122 --> 01:20:07,162
Oh, please, Franklin !

1496
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:10,579
Spare me your bawdy mind
first thing in the morning.

1497
01:20:11,795 --> 01:20:12,875
Dare we call?

1498
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:15,298
A congressman dares anything.

1499
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:17,222
Go ahead.
Me?

1500
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,430
Your voice is more piercing.

1501
01:20:21,847 --> 01:20:24,387
Oh, John, look at her.
Just look at her.

1502
01:20:24,474 --> 01:20:25,684
JOHN: l am.

1503
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:28,687
She's even more magnificent
than l remember.

1504
01:20:30,188 --> 01:20:31,808
Of course, we didn't see
much of her front last night.

1505
01:20:31,898 --> 01:20:32,898
(SHUSHlNG)

1506
01:20:32,983 --> 01:20:34,233
Good morrow, madam.

1507
01:20:34,317 --> 01:20:35,737
Good morrow.

1508
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,450
ls it the habit in
Philadelphia for strangers

1509
01:20:40,532 --> 01:20:42,202
to shout at ladies
from the street?

1510
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:43,494
Not really, but. . .

1511
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:48,037
And for men of your age
it is not only unseemly,
it is unsightly.

1512
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:52,459
Uh, excuse me, madam,
but we met last evening.

1513
01:20:53,587 --> 01:20:55,247
l spoke to no one
last evening.

1514
01:20:55,338 --> 01:20:56,588
lndeed, you did not.

1515
01:20:56,673 --> 01:20:59,343
Nonetheless,
we did present ourselves.

1516
01:20:59,426 --> 01:21:02,386
This is Mr. John Adams.
l'm Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

1517
01:21:03,805 --> 01:21:05,215
The inventor of the stove.

1518
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:10,597
Please! l know your names
very well, but. . .

1519
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:13,107
Well, you said
you presented yourselves
last night?

1520
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:15,940
lt's of no matter.
Your thoughts were
well-taken elsewhere.

1521
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:17,900
Oh.

1522
01:21:19,029 --> 01:21:20,949
My husband is not yet up.

1523
01:21:21,031 --> 01:21:23,451
Well, then shall we
start over again?
Won't you join us?

1524
01:21:24,284 --> 01:21:26,044
Yes, of course.

1525
01:21:28,288 --> 01:21:29,748
Well, no wonder
the man couldn't write.

1526
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,791
Who would think
of independence
married to her?

1527
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:32,995
l feel an absolute fool.

1528
01:21:33,084 --> 01:21:34,134
That's good for you, John.

1529
01:21:34,211 --> 01:21:36,131
l tell you, Franklin,
it's positively indecent.

1530
01:21:36,213 --> 01:21:37,713
John, they're young
and they're in love.

1531
01:21:37,798 --> 01:21:39,878
Not them, Franklin. Us.

1532
01:21:39,966 --> 01:21:43,136
Standing down here,
waiting for them to, uh. . .

1533
01:21:44,304 --> 01:21:46,184
Well, what will
people think?

1534
01:21:46,264 --> 01:21:49,564
Don't worry, John.
The history books
will clean it up.

1535
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:50,813
Well, it doesn't matter.

1536
01:21:51,144 --> 01:21:54,564
l'll not appear in
the history books anyway.
Only you.

1537
01:21:54,648 --> 01:21:57,068
Franklin did this
and Franklin did that,

1538
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,490
and Franklin did
some other damned thing.

1539
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:02,741
Franklin smote the ground
and out sprang

1540
01:22:02,823 --> 01:22:04,533
George Washington,

1541
01:22:04,616 --> 01:22:06,946
fully grown
and on his horse.

1542
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:10,445
Franklin then
electrified him with his
miraculous lightning rod

1543
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:14,169
then the three of them,
Franklin, Washington
and the horse,

1544
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:17,461
conducted
the entire revolution
all by themselves.

1545
01:22:20,882 --> 01:22:21,922
l like it.

1546
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:26,180
l beg your pardon, gentlemen.

1547
01:22:27,305 --> 01:22:31,345
lt is indeed an honor
to meet the two
greatest men in America.

1548
01:22:31,434 --> 01:22:33,734
Certainly the greatest
within earshot anyway.

1549
01:22:33,812 --> 01:22:35,692
l'm not an idle flatterer,
Dr. Franklin.

1550
01:22:35,772 --> 01:22:37,982
My husband
admires you both greatly.

1551
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:39,691
Then we are
doubly flattered,

1552
01:22:39,776 --> 01:22:43,146
for we admire very much
that what
your husband admires.

1553
01:22:48,285 --> 01:22:49,865
Uh, did you
sleep well, madam?

1554
01:22:49,953 --> 01:22:50,953
Hmm?
Huh !

1555
01:22:51,037 --> 01:22:52,197
Oh. Uh. . .

1556
01:22:52,706 --> 01:22:54,616
Well, l mean,
did you lie. . .

1557
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,458
(SCOFFS)

1558
01:22:57,168 --> 01:22:58,208
Damn it, you know
what l mean.

1559
01:22:58,295 --> 01:22:59,545
Yes, John, we know
what you mean.

1560
01:22:59,629 --> 01:23:02,259
Tell us about yourself.
We've heard precious little.

1561
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:04,382
What's your
first name?
Martha.

1562
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:05,684
Martha!

1563
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:08,715
He might at least
have told us that.

1564
01:23:08,805 --> 01:23:10,345
Your husband
doesn't say very much.

1565
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:11,932
Most silent man
in Congress.

1566
01:23:12,017 --> 01:23:13,887
l have never heard
him utter three
sentences together.

1567
01:23:13,977 --> 01:23:15,557
Not every man's
a talker, John.

1568
01:23:16,062 --> 01:23:19,862
Yes, it's true, you know.
Tom is not a talker.

1569
01:23:22,569 --> 01:23:26,199
Oh, he never
speaks his passions

1570
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:29,331
He never speaks
his views

1571
01:23:29,492 --> 01:23:32,912
Whereas other
men speak volumes

1572
01:23:32,996 --> 01:23:37,496
The man I Iove
is mute

1573
01:23:37,584 --> 01:23:40,174
In truth
I can't recaII

1574
01:23:40,253 --> 01:23:43,463
Being wooed
with words

1575
01:23:43,548 --> 01:23:45,838
At aII

1576
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:49,756
Even now

1577
01:23:49,846 --> 01:23:51,346
Oh, don't stop,
madam.

1578
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:53,141
No. Tell us,
how did he win you?

1579
01:23:53,224 --> 01:23:56,394
And how does he hold on
to a bounty such as you?

1580
01:23:56,478 --> 01:23:59,308
Well, surely you've noticed
that Tom is a man of
many accomplishments.

1581
01:23:59,397 --> 01:24:00,397
Of course.

1582
01:24:00,482 --> 01:24:03,652
Author, lawyer,
statesman, architect,
farmer.

1583
01:24:04,903 --> 01:24:09,033
And still one more that
l hesitate to mention.

1584
01:24:09,115 --> 01:24:11,325
Don't hesitate, madam.
Don't hesitate.

1585
01:24:11,409 --> 01:24:14,869
No, tell us.
What else can that
redheaded tombstone do?

1586
01:24:17,248 --> 01:24:22,248
He plays the violin

1587
01:24:22,337 --> 01:24:26,587
He tucks it
right under his chin

1588
01:24:26,675 --> 01:24:28,795
And he bows

1589
01:24:28,927 --> 01:24:31,007
Oh, he bows

1590
01:24:31,096 --> 01:24:35,016
For he knows
Yes, he knows

1591
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:39,230
That it's
hi-hi-hi-diddIe diddIe

1592

The violin, madam?

1598
01:24:57,706 --> 01:25:01,246
I hear his vioIin

1599
01:25:01,334 --> 01:25:04,884

that feeling within

And l sigh
Oh, l sigh

very near

l'm always undone

1608
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:34,367
That settles it, John.
We're taking up the violin.

1609
01:25:34,784 --> 01:25:37,454
Very well, madam.
You have us playing
the violin. What happens next?

1610
01:25:37,537 --> 01:25:38,617
Next, Mr. Adams?

1611
01:25:38,705 --> 01:25:40,155
Yes. What does
Tom do now?

1612
01:25:40,498 --> 01:25:41,828
Why, just what
you'd expect.

1613
01:25:44,669 --> 01:25:45,709
We dance.

1614
01:25:46,504 --> 01:25:47,504
Dance?

1615
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:49,799
Dance? lncredible!

1616
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:52,930
One, two, three.
One, two, three!

1617
01:25:57,515 --> 01:25:59,425
JOHN: Who's playing
the violin?

1618
01:25:59,517 --> 01:26:01,137
John, really?

1619
01:26:37,722 --> 01:26:39,602
John, you can dance.

1620
01:26:39,682 --> 01:26:42,682
We still do a few
things in Boston, Franklin.

1621
01:26:57,117 --> 01:26:59,827

the declaration
after all.

What do you think of it,
Doctor? Democracy?

What Plato called

01:31:22,882 --> 01:31:24,132
Well, what about
Delaware?

1705
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:27,337
Sad thing to see them
on the wrong side
after all this time.

1706
01:31:27,428 --> 01:31:29,298
Any news of Rodney?
Yes. McKean's back.

1707
01:31:29,389 --> 01:31:30,389
Thomas!

1708
01:31:30,473 --> 01:31:32,353
"A committee formed
to study the causes

1709
01:31:32,433 --> 01:31:34,433
"of our military
defeat in Canada."

1710
01:31:34,519 --> 01:31:36,139
Thomas,

1711
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:38,649
how did you
leave Caesar?
ls he still alive?

1712
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:40,861
Aye, but the
journey to Dover

1713
01:31:40,942 --> 01:31:42,732
was fearful
hard on him.

1714
01:31:42,819 --> 01:31:44,569
He never complained,
but l could see

1715
01:31:44,654 --> 01:31:46,454
the poor man was
suffering terrible.

1716
01:31:46,531 --> 01:31:48,491
But you got him
safely home.

1717
01:31:48,574 --> 01:31:49,834
l did,

1718
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:52,289
but l doubt he'll ever
set foot out of it again.

1719
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:54,830
That leaves you and Read
split down the middle.
Will he come over?

1720
01:31:54,914 --> 01:31:57,714
l don't know.
He's a stubborn
ignoramus.

1721
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,752
Work on him.
Keep after him till
you wear him down.

1722
01:31:59,836 --> 01:32:01,376
Look, John,
face facts, will you?

1723
01:32:01,462 --> 01:32:03,422
lf it were just Read
standing in our way,

1724
01:32:03,506 --> 01:32:04,546
it wouldn't be so bad,

1725
01:32:04,632 --> 01:32:05,972
but look for
yourself, man.

1726
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:10,010

and the entire South.
lt's impossible!

1727
01:32:10,096 --> 01:32:13,266
Well, it's impossible
if we all stand around
complaining about it.

1728
01:32:13,349 --> 01:32:16,179
To work, McKean !
One foot in front
of the other!

1729
01:32:16,269 --> 01:32:17,519
l believe l put
it a better way.

1730
01:32:17,603 --> 01:32:18,943
Never leave off
until tomorrow. . .

1731
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:20,691
Shut up, Franklin.

1732
01:32:20,773 --> 01:32:23,193
But what good will it do?

1733
01:32:23,276 --> 01:32:26,276
You know Dickinson.
He'll never give in.

1734
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:28,699
And you haven't
heard the last of
Rutledge either.

1735
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:30,951
Never mind about them.
Your job is George Read.

1736
01:32:31,033 --> 01:32:32,123
Talk him deaf
if you have to,

1737
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:33,791
but bring us
back Delaware.

1738
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:34,870
There's a
simpler way.

1739
01:32:34,954 --> 01:32:36,084
What?

1740
01:32:36,664 --> 01:32:38,124
This'll break
the tie.

1741
01:32:38,207 --> 01:32:40,167
All right, John,
who's next?

1742

you try to get your
own house into order

1746

at old vacant-face.

1747

1748
01:32:53,973 --> 01:32:55,973
Ah, Mr. Chase!

1749
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,350
How about it, Chase?
When are you coming
to your senses, man?

1750
01:32:59,437 --> 01:33:02,517
Please, Mr. Adams,
not while l'm eating.

1751
01:33:02,607 --> 01:33:04,187
Mr. Wilson, sir?

1752
01:33:05,109 --> 01:33:07,029
lt's time to
assert yourself.

1753
01:33:07,111 --> 01:33:09,071
Tell me something.
When you were a judge,

1754
01:33:09,155 --> 01:33:12,025
how in hell did you
ever make a decision?

1755
01:33:12,116 --> 01:33:16,826
The decisions l made
were all based on
legality and precedence.

1756
01:33:16,913 --> 01:33:19,083
But there is
no legality here

1757
01:33:19,165 --> 01:33:20,995
and certainly
no precedent.

1758
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:25,803
Because it's a
new idea, you clot!

1759
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,420
We'll be setting
our own precedent!

1760
01:33:28,508 --> 01:33:32,468
No, Mr. McKean.
No, no, no!

1761
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:34,103
Damn your
eyes, Read !

1762
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:36,060
You come into this
world screaming "no,"

1763
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:40,140
and you're determined
to leave it the same way,
you slimy worm !

waiting on you, Chase!

America is waiting !
The whole world is waiting !

What's that? Kidney?

1767
01:33:50,488 --> 01:33:53,068
Leave me alone,
Mr. Adams!

1768
01:33:53,157 --> 01:33:54,697
You're wasting
your time.

1769

could win this war,

But you must know
it's impossible.

1772

Washington's dispatches.

His army has
fallen to pieces.

1774

exaggerating
the situation

1775

in order to arouse
this torpid Congress
into action.

1776
01:34:11,133 --> 01:34:12,683
Why, as chairman of
the War Committee,

1777
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,140
l can state for a fact

1778
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:16,560
that the army has
never been in
better shape.

1779
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,309
Never have troops
been more cheerful.

1780
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:21,562
Never have soldiers
been more resolute.

1781
01:34:21,644 --> 01:34:25,364
Never have training
and discipline
been more spirited.

them yourself?

01:38:11,248 --> 01:38:14,078
All right, Chase!
Move all that lard.
Not a moment to lose.

1870
01:38:14,168 --> 01:38:17,798
Left, right, left, right.
Left, right, left, right.

1871
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,550
Left, right, left!

1872
01:38:30,643 --> 01:38:34,523
Mr. McNair, all this
talk of independence

1873
01:38:34,605 --> 01:38:37,315
has left a certain
foulness in the air.

1874
01:38:37,399 --> 01:38:38,979
My friends and l
would appreciate it

1875
01:38:39,068 --> 01:38:41,318
if you could
open some windows.

1876
01:38:41,403 --> 01:38:43,573
Well, what about
the flies?

1877
01:38:43,656 --> 01:38:45,656
The windows,
Mr. McNair.

1878
01:38:47,868 --> 01:38:50,908
Open the windows,
close the windows.

1879
01:38:50,996 --> 01:38:52,996
Sweet Jesus!

1880
01:39:02,049 --> 01:39:06,179
Oh, say, do you
see what I see?

1881
01:39:06,679 --> 01:39:10,059
Congress sitting
here in sweet serenity

1882
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:13,430
I could cheer,
the reason's cIear

1883
01:39:13,519 --> 01:39:15,689
For the first
time in a year

1884
01:39:15,771 --> 01:39:17,771
Adams isn't here

1885
01:39:17,857 --> 01:39:21,397
And look, the sun
is in the sky

1886
01:39:21,485 --> 01:39:23,485
A breeze is blowing by

1887
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:27,451

a single fly

We never, ever go
off half-cocked, not we

1943

Why begin till we
know that we can win

1944
01:42:29,465 --> 01:42:33,255
And if we cannot win,
why bother to begin?

1945
01:42:33,343 --> 01:42:37,013
We say this game's
not of our choosing

1946
01:42:37,806 --> 01:42:41,136
Why should we
risk losing?

1947
01:42:41,268 --> 01:42:45,098
We're cool, cool men

1948
01:42:47,107 --> 01:42:48,647
Mr. Hancock,

1949
01:42:48,734 --> 01:42:51,404
you're a man
of property,
one of us.

1950
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:54,411
Why don't you join
us in our minuet?

1951
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:57,160
Why do you
persist in dancing
with John Adams?

1952
01:42:57,242 --> 01:42:59,202
Good Lord, sir,
you don't even
like him.

1953
01:42:59,745 --> 01:43:03,035
That is true.
He annoys me quite a lot

1954
01:43:03,123 --> 01:43:06,463
But stiII I'd rather trot
to Mr. Adams' new gavotte

1955
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,250
Why? For personal glory?
For a place in history?

1956
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:13,880
Be careful, sir.
History will brand him
and his followers as traitors.

1957
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:16,836
Traitors,
Mr. Dickinson?
To what?

1958
01:43:16,929 --> 01:43:20,429
The British Crown or
the British half crown?

1959
01:43:20,516 --> 01:43:22,516
Fortunately, there are
not enough men of property

1960
01:43:22,601 --> 01:43:24,351
in America
to dictate policy.

1961
01:43:24,436 --> 01:43:28,016
Perhaps not, but don't forget
that most men with nothing

1962
01:43:28,107 --> 01:43:31,357
would rather
protect the possibility
of becoming rich

1963
01:43:31,443 --> 01:43:33,993
than face the reality
of being poor.

1964
01:43:36,406 --> 01:43:38,776
And that is why
they will follow us. . .

1965
01:43:38,867 --> 01:43:42,697
To the right,
ever to the right

1966
01:43:42,788 --> 01:43:46,458

How'd you like
to try and borrow

1987
01:45:11,919 --> 01:45:14,089
a dollar from
one of them?

1988
01:45:15,172 --> 01:45:17,302
You want some
more rum, General?

1989
01:45:17,382 --> 01:45:18,632
General?

1990
01:45:19,509 --> 01:45:21,589
Lord, l ain't

There you go.

Sit down, gentlemen.
The chair rules it's
too damn hot to work.

1995
01:45:48,121 --> 01:45:50,871
Well, General,
what's it like
out there?

1996
01:45:51,416 --> 01:45:53,376
You probably
know more than me.

1997
01:45:53,669 --> 01:45:54,749
Sitting here?

1998
01:45:54,836 --> 01:45:57,086
Sweet Jesus,
this is the
last place

1999
01:45:57,172 --> 01:45:58,802
to find out
what's going on.

2000
01:45:59,841 --> 01:46:01,341
l'm aiming
to join up.

2001
01:46:01,426 --> 01:46:03,046
What are you
talking about?

2002
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,506
You don't have
to join up.

2003
01:46:04,596 --> 01:46:05,636
You're in Congress.

2004
01:46:05,722 --> 01:46:07,012
What's that
got to do with it?

2005
01:46:07,099 --> 01:46:10,229
Well, you don't
see them rushing off
to get killed, do you?

2006
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:13,190
They sure are great
ones for sending others,
l can tell you that.

2007
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:15,559
Hey, who sits here?

2008
01:46:16,066 --> 01:46:18,106
Caesar Rodney
of Delaware.

2009
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:19,900
Where are you from,
General?

2010
01:46:20,195 --> 01:46:21,855
Watertown.

2011
01:46:21,947 --> 01:46:23,857
Now where's that?

2012
01:46:23,949 --> 01:46:25,119
Massachusetts.

2013
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:27,410
Well, then you
belong over there.

2014
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:34,748
But be careful.

2015
01:46:35,127 --> 01:46:36,537
There's something
about that chair

2016
01:46:36,628 --> 01:46:38,588
that makes a man
awful noisy.

2017
01:46:38,672 --> 01:46:39,672
(CHUCKLlNG)

2018
01:46:42,968 --> 01:46:44,798
You seen any fighting?

2019
01:46:46,138 --> 01:46:47,388
Sure did.

2020
01:46:48,515 --> 01:46:52,435
l see'd my two best
friends get shot dead
on the very same day.

2021
01:46:53,353 --> 01:46:55,773
And at Lexington
it was, too.

2022
01:46:55,856 --> 01:46:57,976
Right on the
village green.

2023
01:46:58,692 --> 01:46:59,902
When they didn't
come home for supper,

2024
01:46:59,985 --> 01:47:02,985
their mamas
went down the hill
looking for them.

2025
01:47:03,071 --> 01:47:05,361
Mrs. Lowell,
she found Timothy.

2026
01:47:07,659 --> 01:47:08,989
Right off.

2027
01:47:12,247 --> 01:47:13,997
But Mrs. Pickett. . .

2028
01:47:16,835 --> 01:47:19,705
She looked near half
the night for William.

2029
01:47:20,881 --> 01:47:23,301
He went and
crawled off
the green

2030
01:47:24,426 --> 01:47:25,966
before he died.

01:47:57,542 --> 01:47:59,712
Look sharp

Mama, look sharp

01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:18,980
Them soldiers,
they fired

2041
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:23,189
Oh, Ma, did we run

2042
01:48:24,069 --> 01:48:27,989
But then
we turned round

2043
01:48:28,073 --> 01:48:32,413
And the
battle begun

2044
01:48:33,578 --> 01:48:37,208

Oh, Ma, am l done?

01:51:52,694 --> 01:51:54,654
But when a flock
of ducks flew over

their first meal

And a sage

2128
01:53:06,393 --> 01:53:08,273
A bit gouty in the leg

2129
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:11,109

it's quite bizarre

01:53:11,189 --> 01:53:13,109
To think that
here we are

01:53:13,191 --> 01:53:16,571
Playing midwives
to an egg

2132
01:53:17,821 --> 01:53:19,031
Egg? What egg?

2133
01:53:19,114 --> 01:53:21,164
America. The birth
of a new nation.

01:53:21,241 --> 01:53:22,281
lf only we could
be sure

2135
01:53:22,367 --> 01:53:24,487
of what kind of
a bird it's going to be.

2136
01:53:24,577 --> 01:53:27,117
Tom has a point.
What sort of bird
shall we choose

2137
01:53:27,205 --> 01:53:29,325
as the symbol of
our new America?

2138
01:53:29,416 --> 01:53:31,376
The eagle.

2139
01:53:31,459 --> 01:53:32,879
The dove.

2140
01:53:32,961 --> 01:53:34,341
The turkey.

2141
01:53:35,714 --> 01:53:37,054
The eagle.

2142
01:53:38,007 --> 01:53:40,257
The dove.
The eagle!

2143
01:53:41,678 --> 01:53:43,548
The eagle.
The turkey.

2144
01:53:44,889 --> 01:53:46,929
The eagle is a
majestic bird.

2145
01:53:47,016 --> 01:53:47,976
The eagle
is a scavenger,

2146
01:53:48,059 --> 01:53:49,769
a thief and
a coward.

2147
01:53:49,853 --> 01:53:51,193
A symbol of
over 1 0 centuries

2148
01:53:51,271 --> 01:53:53,441
of European mischief.

2149
01:53:53,523 --> 01:53:54,823
A turkey?

2150
01:53:54,899 --> 01:53:57,069
The turkey is
a truly noble bird.

2151
01:53:57,152 --> 01:54:00,242
Native American.
Source of sustenance of
our original settlers.

2152
01:54:00,321 --> 01:54:02,531
An incredibly brave
fellow who will not flinch

2153
01:54:02,615 --> 01:54:04,155
at attacking a regiment
of Englishmen

2154
01:54:04,242 --> 01:54:05,662
single-handedly!

2155
01:54:05,744 --> 01:54:08,414
Therefore, the national bird
of America is going to be. . .

2156
01:54:08,496 --> 01:54:11,076
The eagle!

2157
01:54:11,583 --> 01:54:14,713
We're waiting for
the chirp, chirp, chirp

2158
01:54:15,503 --> 01:54:18,213
Of an eaglet being born

2159
01:54:18,298 --> 01:54:21,378
Waiting for the chirp,
chirp, chirp

the temperature's
hot enough

To hatch a stone,
let alone an egg

2164
01:54:36,941 --> 01:54:40,441
We're waiting
for the scratch,
scratch, scratch

2165
01:54:40,528 --> 01:54:43,658
Of that tiny little fellow

2166
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:46,740
Waiting for the egg to hatch

But wiII it
hatch an egg?

2172
01:55:02,634 --> 01:55:06,724
The declaration
will be a triumph.
l tell you, a triumph.

2173
01:55:06,805 --> 01:55:08,925
lf l was ever
sure of anything,
l'm sure of that.

2174
01:55:09,015 --> 01:55:10,345
A triumph.

2175
01:55:11,476 --> 01:55:12,806
And if it isn't,

2176
01:55:12,894 --> 01:55:13,894
we've still got
four days left

2177
01:55:13,978 --> 01:55:16,058
to think of
something else.

2178
01:55:16,147 --> 01:55:19,687
The eagle's going
to crack the sheII

2179
01:55:19,776 --> 01:55:22,486
Of the egg
that England laid

2180
01:55:22,612 --> 01:55:25,572
Yes, sir, we can
tell, tell, tell

And just as
Tom here has written

2184

Though the shell may
belong to Great Britain

2185
01:55:39,003 --> 01:55:42,763
The eagle inside
belongs to us

2186
01:55:42,841 --> 01:55:45,931
And just as
Tom here has written

2187
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:48,430
We say, "To hell
with Great Britain"

2188
01:55:48,513 --> 01:55:53,853
The eagle inside
belongs to us

Gentlemen, please!

Colonel McKean,
l saw your hand first.

2203
01:56:42,942 --> 01:56:44,482
Mr. Jefferson,

2204
01:56:44,569 --> 01:56:47,949
it's a funny paper
you've written, Tom,
but somewhere in it,

2205
01:56:48,031 --> 01:56:51,991
you mention Scottish
and foreign mercenaries
sent to destroy us.

2206
01:56:52,785 --> 01:56:54,285
Scottish, Tom?

2207
01:56:54,746 --> 01:56:56,616
That is in reference
to a Highland regiment

2208
01:56:56,706 --> 01:56:58,076
which stood
against us
at Boston.

2209
01:56:59,751 --> 01:57:01,961
lt's more likely
Germans wearing kilts

2210
01:57:02,045 --> 01:57:04,245
to disguise
their being there.

remove the word

2212

giving offense

2216
01:57:15,391 --> 01:57:17,641
Mr. Jefferson,
nowhere do you mention

2217
01:57:17,727 --> 01:57:19,727
the Supreme Being.

2218
01:57:19,812 --> 01:57:21,402
Now, surely this
was an oversight,

2219
01:57:21,481 --> 01:57:25,981
for how could we hope
to achieve a victory
without His help?

2220
01:57:26,069 --> 01:57:28,529
Therefore,
l most humbly suggest
the following addition

2221
01:57:28,613 --> 01:57:30,363
to your final sentence.

2222
01:57:30,448 --> 01:57:34,278
"With a firm reliance
on the protection of
Divine Providence."

2223
01:57:34,619 --> 01:57:35,659
Mr. Jefferson?

2224
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:39,870
Mr. Read.

2225
01:57:41,584 --> 01:57:44,634
Among your charges
against the king,
Mr. Jefferson,

2226
01:57:44,712 --> 01:57:46,212
you accuse him
of depriving us

2227
01:57:46,297 --> 01:57:48,837
of the benefits
of trial by jury.

2228
01:57:48,925 --> 01:57:50,295
This is untrue, sir.

2229
01:57:50,385 --> 01:57:53,295
ln Delaware, we've
always had trial by jury.

2230
01:57:54,222 --> 01:57:56,062
ln Massachusetts,
we have not.

2231
01:57:56,808 --> 01:57:58,558
Well, then l suggest
that the words

2232
01:57:58,643 --> 01:58:00,483
"in many cases"
be added.

2233
01:58:01,479 --> 01:58:02,979
Mr. Jefferson?

2234
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:06,691
"ln many cases"?
Brilliant!

2235
01:58:06,776 --> 01:58:09,316
l suppose every time
you see those three words,

2236
01:58:09,404 --> 01:58:11,574
your puny chest
will swell with pride

2237
01:58:11,656 --> 01:58:14,316

historical contribution.

2238
01:58:14,409 --> 01:58:15,529

2239

unprincipled
whitewash

l beg you to remember
that we still have
friends in England.

2250
01:58:47,608 --> 01:58:51,528

"Unfeeling brethren"
and "enemies at war."

2252
01:58:55,324 --> 01:58:58,664
Our quarrel is
with the British king,
not the British people.

2253

Be sensible, Bartlett.

2254

Remove those phrases,

2255
01:59:01,956 --> 01:59:04,786

becomes meaningless.

2256
01:59:04,876 --> 01:59:08,086

2295
02:00:42,682 --> 02:00:44,562
l have very little
interest in your paper,

2296
02:00:44,642 --> 02:00:46,182
as there's
no doubt
in my mind

2297
02:00:46,269 --> 02:00:48,349
that we've all but
heard the last of it.

2298
02:00:48,437 --> 02:00:51,017
But l am curious
about one thing.

2299
02:00:51,983 --> 02:00:55,403
Why do you refer
to King George
as a tyrant?

2300
02:00:57,113 --> 02:00:58,993
Because he
is a tyrant.

2301
02:00:59,991 --> 02:01:01,451
l remind you,
Mr. Jefferson,

2302
02:01:01,534 --> 02:01:03,954
that this tyrant
is still your king.

2303
02:01:05,663 --> 02:01:07,913
When a king
becomes a tyrant,

2304
02:01:07,999 --> 02:01:09,539
he thereby
breaks the contract

2305
02:01:09,625 --> 02:01:11,585
binding his
subjects to him.

2306
02:01:11,669 --> 02:01:13,299
How so?

02:01:13,379 --> 02:01:15,509
By taking away
their rights.

2308
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:18,550
Rights that
came from him
in the first place?

2309
02:01:18,634 --> 02:01:20,344
All except one.

2310
02:01:20,428 --> 02:01:23,138
The right to be free
comes from nature.

2311
02:01:24,015 --> 02:01:26,975
And are we not free,
Mr. Jefferson?

2312
02:01:29,187 --> 02:01:31,307
Homes entered
without warrant.

2313
02:01:31,397 --> 02:01:34,517
Citizens arrested
without charge.

2314
02:01:34,609 --> 02:01:35,609
And in many places,

2315
02:01:35,693 --> 02:01:37,993
free assembly
itself denied.

2316
02:01:38,070 --> 02:01:40,820

of such things,

2317
02:01:40,907 --> 02:01:43,197

dangerous times.

2318

02:04:25,196 --> 02:04:26,986
Slavery, Mr. Rutledge.

2382
02:04:27,073 --> 02:04:28,323
Oh, yes.

2383
02:04:28,407 --> 02:04:31,027
You're referring to us
as slaves of the king.

2384
02:04:31,118 --> 02:04:33,788
No, sir. l'm referring
to our slaves.

2385
02:04:33,871 --> 02:04:39,671
Black slaves.

2386
02:04:40,878 --> 02:04:43,128
Why didn't you
say so, sir?

2387
02:04:43,214 --> 02:04:45,804
Were you trying to
hide your meaning?

2388
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:47,800
No, sir.

2389
02:04:47,885 --> 02:04:50,715
Just another
literary license, then.

2390
02:04:51,847 --> 02:04:53,217
lf you like.

2391
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:56,600
l don't like at all,
Mr. Jefferson.

2392
02:04:57,645 --> 02:04:59,145
To us,
in South Carolina,

2393
02:04:59,230 --> 02:05:01,690
black slavery is
our peculiar institution,

2394
02:05:01,774 --> 02:05:03,574
and a cherished
way of life.

2395
02:05:03,651 --> 02:05:06,491
Nevertheless,
we must abolish it.

2396
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:09,610
Nothing is more
certainly written
in the book of fate

2397
02:05:09,698 --> 02:05:11,568
than that these
people shall be free.

2398
02:05:11,659 --> 02:05:15,579
l am not concerned
with the book of fate
right now, Mr. Jefferson.

2399
02:05:15,663 --> 02:05:18,293
l'm more concerned
with what is written in
that little paper there.

2400
02:05:18,374 --> 02:05:19,674
That little
paper there

2401
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:22,090
deals with freedom
for Americans.

2402
02:05:24,088 --> 02:05:25,418
Oh, really?

2403
02:05:26,882 --> 02:05:28,132
Mr. Adams

2404
02:05:28,884 --> 02:05:33,184
is now calling our
black slaves "Americans."

2405
02:05:33,264 --> 02:05:34,314
Are they, now?

2406
02:05:34,432 --> 02:05:35,392
Yes, they are.

2407
02:05:35,474 --> 02:05:37,984
They're people
and they're here.

2408
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:39,810
lf there's any
other requirement,
l've never heard of it.

2409
02:05:39,895 --> 02:05:42,765
They are here, yes,
but they are not people,
sir. They are property.

2410
02:05:42,857 --> 02:05:44,517
No, sir.
They are people

2411
02:05:44,608 --> 02:05:47,068
who are being
treated as property.

2412
02:05:47,153 --> 02:05:49,863
l tell you, the rights
of human nature

2413
02:05:49,947 --> 02:05:51,277
are deeply wounded

2414
02:05:51,365 --> 02:05:53,525
by this
infamous practice.

2415
02:05:53,617 --> 02:05:55,487
Then see to your
own wounds,
Mr. Jefferson,

2416
02:05:55,578 --> 02:05:57,538
for you are
a practitioner!

2417
02:05:57,621 --> 02:05:59,041
Are you not?

2418
02:06:05,296 --> 02:06:08,126
l have
already resolved

2419
02:06:09,133 --> 02:06:10,933
to release
my slaves.

2420
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:30,860
Then l'm sorry,

2421
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:33,359
for you've
also resolved

2422
02:06:33,449 --> 02:06:35,829
the ruination of
your personal economy.

2423
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:38,290
JOHN: Economy.
Always economy.

2424
02:06:39,413 --> 02:06:42,423
There's more to this
than a filthy purse
string, Rutledge.

2425
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,580
lt's an offense
against man and God.

2426
02:06:44,668 --> 02:06:46,458
HOPKlNS: lt's a
stinking business,
Mr. Rutledge.

2427
02:06:46,545 --> 02:06:48,085
A stinking business.

2428
02:06:48,172 --> 02:06:50,222
ls it really,
Mr. Hopkins?

2429
02:06:50,299 --> 02:06:52,379
Then what is
that l smell

2430
02:06:52,468 --> 02:06:54,678
floating down
from the North?

2431
02:06:56,222 --> 02:06:58,642
Could that be
the aroma of hypocrisy?

2432
02:06:58,724 --> 02:07:02,854
For who holds the
other end of that filthy
purse string, Mr. Adams?

2433
02:07:06,315 --> 02:07:08,775
Our Northern
brethren

2434
02:07:08,859 --> 02:07:11,649
feeling a bit tender
toward our slaves.

2435
02:07:11,737 --> 02:07:13,657
They don't
keep slaves.

2436
02:07:14,198 --> 02:07:15,368
Oh, no.

2437
02:07:16,617 --> 02:07:20,407
But they're
willing to be
considerable carriers

2438
02:07:20,496 --> 02:07:22,246
of slaves to others.

2439
02:07:22,998 --> 02:07:24,578
They're willing.

2440
02:07:26,043 --> 02:07:27,673
For the shilling.

2441
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:30,510
Or haven't you heard,
Mr. Adams?

2442
02:07:31,882 --> 02:07:34,472
Clink, clink.

2443
02:07:35,553 --> 02:07:38,143
MoIasses to rum

2444
02:07:38,222 --> 02:07:41,062
To sIaves

2445
02:07:41,141 --> 02:07:46,731
Oh, what a
beautifuI waItz

2446
02:07:46,814 --> 02:07:49,574
You dance with us

2447
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:52,070
We dance with you

2448
02:07:52,152 --> 02:07:54,952
In moIasses and rum

2449
02:07:55,030 --> 02:08:00,160
And sIaves

2450
02:08:00,244 --> 02:08:03,874
Who sail the ships
out of Boston

2451
02:08:03,956 --> 02:08:07,826
Ladened with
BibIes and rum?

2452
02:08:07,918 --> 02:08:11,548
Who drinks a toast
to the lvory Coast?

2453
02:08:11,630 --> 02:08:15,550
Hail Africa,
the sIavers have come

2454
02:08:15,634 --> 02:08:19,184
New England with Bibles

2455
02:08:19,263 --> 02:08:21,683
And rum

2456
02:08:22,433 --> 02:08:25,273
And it's off with
the rum and the BibIes

2457
02:08:25,352 --> 02:08:27,852
Take on the slaves,
clink, clink

2458
02:08:27,938 --> 02:08:32,028
Then haiI and
fareweII to the smeII

2459
02:08:32,109 --> 02:08:36,279
Of the African coast

02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:42,290
MoIasses to rum

2461
02:08:42,369 --> 02:08:44,749
To sIaves

2462
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:50,380
'Tisn't morals,
'tis money that saves

2463
02:08:50,461 --> 02:08:53,301
ShaII we dance
to the sound

2464
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:55,720
Of the profitable pound?

2465
02:08:55,799 --> 02:08:58,219
In moIasses and rum

2466
02:08:58,302 --> 02:09:03,562
And sIaves

2467
02:09:03,641 --> 02:09:07,191
Who sail the ships
out of Guinea

2468
02:09:07,269 --> 02:09:10,859
Ladened with
BibIes and sIaves?

2469
02:09:10,939 --> 02:09:14,649
'Tis Boston can boast
to the West Indies coast

02:09:14,735 --> 02:09:18,355
Jamaica, we brung
what ye craves

2471
02:09:18,447 --> 02:09:21,987
Antigua, Barbados

2472
02:09:22,076 --> 02:09:25,446
We brung Bibles

2473
02:09:25,537 --> 02:09:29,287
And sIaves

2474
02:09:29,375 --> 02:09:32,415
Gentlemen, you mustn't think
that our Northern friends

2475
02:09:32,503 --> 02:09:36,053
see our black slaves
as merely figures
in a ledger.

2476
02:09:36,131 --> 02:09:37,421
Oh, no.

2477
02:09:37,508 --> 02:09:41,758
They see them as
figures on a block.

2478
02:09:41,845 --> 02:09:44,505
Look at the faces at
the auctions, gentlemen.

2479
02:09:44,598 --> 02:09:47,098
White faces on
African wharves.

2480
02:09:47,184 --> 02:09:48,814
Seafaring faces.

2481
02:09:48,894 --> 02:09:50,654
New England faces.

2482
02:09:50,729 --> 02:09:53,109
"Put them in the ships."

2483
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:55,780
"Cram them in the ships."

2484
02:09:55,859 --> 02:09:59,609
"Stuff them in the ships."

2485
02:09:59,697 --> 02:10:02,987
Hurry, gentlemen.
Let the auction begin.

2486
02:10:03,534 --> 02:10:08,624
Ya-ha, ya-ha-ma-cundah

2487
02:10:08,706 --> 02:10:12,496
Gentlemen, do you hear?
That's the cry
of the auctioneer.

2488
02:10:12,584 --> 02:10:17,674
Ya-ha, ya-ha-ma-cundah

2489
02:10:17,756 --> 02:10:20,166
Slaves, gentlemen!

2490
02:10:20,259 --> 02:10:22,639
Black gold!

2491
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:25,140
Living gold!

2492
02:10:25,222 --> 02:10:28,892
Gold from Angola!

2493
02:10:28,976 --> 02:10:30,846
Guinea, Guinea, Guinea!

2494
02:10:30,936 --> 02:10:33,726
BIackbirds for saIe

2495
02:10:33,814 --> 02:10:38,364
Ashanti, Ibo, Ibo, Ibo!

BIackbirds for saIe

2497
02:10:41,405 --> 02:10:45,315
HandIe them!

2498
02:10:45,743 --> 02:10:49,163
FondIe them!

2499
02:10:49,246 --> 02:10:52,326
But don't finger them!

2500
02:10:52,416 --> 02:10:57,376
They're prime

Ya-ha, ya-ha-ma-cundah

2502
02:11:04,762 --> 02:11:07,972
For the love of God,
Mr. Rutledge, please.

MoIasses to rum

2504

To sIaves

2505
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:28,530
Who sail the ships
back to Boston

2506
02:11:28,619 --> 02:11:30,999
Ladened with gold

2507
02:11:31,079 --> 02:11:34,209
See it gleam

2508
02:11:34,291 --> 02:11:39,001
Whose fortunes are made
in the triangle trade

2509
02:11:39,087 --> 02:11:43,507
Hail slavery,
the New England dream

2510
02:11:43,592 --> 02:11:46,142
Mr. Adams,
l give you a toast

2511
02:11:47,179 --> 02:11:49,429
Hail, Boston

2512
02:11:49,515 --> 02:11:52,095
Hail, Charleston

2513
02:11:53,644 --> 02:12:00,654
Who stinketh
the most?

2514
02:12:08,909 --> 02:12:11,329
JOHN: Mr. Rutledge,
please!

2515
02:12:14,122 --> 02:12:15,462
Mr. Hewes.

2516
02:12:18,919 --> 02:12:20,169
Dr. Hall.

2517
02:12:31,014 --> 02:12:33,604
Don't worry, John.
They'll be back.

2518
02:12:33,684 --> 02:12:36,314
Aye, to vote us down.

2519
02:12:42,985 --> 02:12:44,985
CHASE: Adams! Franklin !

2520
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:48,450
lt's done. l have it.

2521
02:12:48,532 --> 02:12:50,992
And the Maryland
Assembly's approved it.

2522
02:12:51,076 --> 02:12:53,196
l told them about
one of the greatest

2523
02:12:53,287 --> 02:12:56,207
military engagements
in history

2524
02:12:56,290 --> 02:12:58,420
against a flock of. . .

2525
02:13:01,712 --> 02:13:03,172
What's wrong?

2526
02:13:04,756 --> 02:13:05,756
l thought. . .

2527
02:13:05,841 --> 02:13:07,761
You'll have
to forgive them,
Mr. Chase.

2528
02:13:07,843 --> 02:13:10,513
They just suffered
a slight setback.

2529
02:13:10,596 --> 02:13:13,306
And after all,
"What is a man profited

2530
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:17,640
"if he shall gain Maryland
and lose the entire South?"

2531
02:13:18,854 --> 02:13:21,734
Matthew, Chapter 1 6,
Verse 26.

2532
02:13:23,483 --> 02:13:24,693
McNair.

2533
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:27,190
Oh, l know.
The flies.

2534
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:28,319
No.

2535
02:13:29,239 --> 02:13:30,489
The rum.

2536
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:37,910
Well, what are we
all sitting around for, hmm?

2537
02:13:39,291 --> 02:13:41,001
We're wasting time.
Precious time.

2538
02:13:41,084 --> 02:13:43,174
Thomas, l want you
to ride down into Delaware

2539
02:13:43,253 --> 02:13:44,883
and fetch back
Caesar Rodney.

2540
02:13:44,963 --> 02:13:48,303
John, are you mad?
lt's 80 miles,
and he's a dying man.

2541
02:13:48,383 --> 02:13:50,013
No, he's a patriot.

2542
02:13:50,093 --> 02:13:52,893
(SCOFFS) John,
what good will it do?
The South's done us in.

2543
02:13:52,971 --> 02:13:54,601
And suppose they
change their minds?

2544
02:13:54,681 --> 02:13:57,181
Can we get Delaware
without Rodney?

2545
02:13:59,937 --> 02:14:02,977
God ! What a bastardly
bunch we are.

2546
02:14:05,525 --> 02:14:07,025
Stephen,
l want you to. . .

2547
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:08,780
l'm going to the tavern,
Johnny.

2548
02:14:08,862 --> 02:14:12,412
lf there's anything
l can do for you there,
let me know.

2549
02:14:13,325 --> 02:14:14,485
Chase.

2550
02:14:15,369 --> 02:14:16,449
Bartlett!

2551
02:14:16,536 --> 02:14:20,116
What's the use,
John? The vote's
tomorrow morning.

2552
02:14:20,207 --> 02:14:22,627
There's less than
a full day left.

2553
02:14:26,004 --> 02:14:27,554
Roger.

2554
02:14:27,631 --> 02:14:30,131
Face facts, John.
lt's finished.

2555
02:14:32,886 --> 02:14:34,466
l'm sorry, John.

2556
02:14:42,854 --> 02:14:44,814
We have no choice,
John.

2557
02:14:45,983 --> 02:14:47,823
The slavery clause
has got to go.

2558
02:14:51,071 --> 02:14:52,491
Franklin, what are you saying?

2559
02:14:52,990 --> 02:14:54,780
lt's a luxury we can't afford.

2560
02:14:55,909 --> 02:14:57,159
A luxury?

2561
02:14:59,579 --> 02:15:03,329
A half million souls
in chains,

2562
02:15:03,417 --> 02:15:06,417
and Dr. Franklin
calls it a luxury.

2563
02:15:07,546 --> 02:15:09,416
Maybe you should've
walked out with the South.

2564
02:15:09,965 --> 02:15:11,915
You forget yourself, sir.

2565
02:15:12,009 --> 02:15:15,179
l founded the first
anti-slavery society
on this continent.

2566
02:15:15,637 --> 02:15:17,257
Don't wave
your credentials at me.

2567
02:15:17,347 --> 02:15:18,927
Perhaps it's time
you had them renewed.

2568
02:15:19,558 --> 02:15:22,598
The issue here
is independence.

2569
02:15:22,686 --> 02:15:25,476
Perhaps you've
forgotten that fact,
but l have not.

2570
02:15:25,564 --> 02:15:29,114
How dare you
jeopardize our cause

2571
02:15:29,192 --> 02:15:31,112
when we've come so far!

2572
02:15:32,738 --> 02:15:34,068
These men,

2573
02:15:35,365 --> 02:15:37,615
no matter how much
we may disagree with them,

2574
02:15:37,701 --> 02:15:41,121
are not ribbon clerks
to be ordered about.

2575
02:15:41,204 --> 02:15:44,424
They're proud,
accomplished men.
The cream of their colonies.

2576
02:15:44,499 --> 02:15:45,959
And whether
you like it or not,

2577
02:15:46,043 --> 02:15:47,503
they and the people
they represent

2578
02:15:47,586 --> 02:15:51,456
will be part of
this new nation
you hope to create.

2579
02:15:51,548 --> 02:15:54,758
Now either learn
how to live with them
or pack up and go home.

2580
02:16:00,390 --> 02:16:03,480
ln any case,
stop acting like
a Boston fishwife.

2581
02:16:17,574 --> 02:16:20,454
Good God.
What's happened to me?

2582
02:16:20,535 --> 02:16:23,825
John Adams.
The great John Adams.

2583
02:16:24,331 --> 02:16:25,871
What have l come to?

2584
02:16:25,957 --> 02:16:27,827
Law practice down the pipe.

2585
02:16:27,918 --> 02:16:30,038
Farm mortgaged to the hilt.

2586
02:16:30,128 --> 02:16:33,258
At a stage in life
when other men prosper,

2587
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:35,970
l'm reduced to
living in Philadelphia.

2588
02:16:38,011 --> 02:16:39,471
Philadelphia.

2589
02:16:42,891 --> 02:16:44,431
(SlGHS)

2590
02:16:48,855 --> 02:16:51,435
Abigail,
what am l going to do?

2591
02:16:51,525 --> 02:16:52,775
ABlGAlL: Do, John?

2592
02:16:54,111 --> 02:16:55,781
l need your help.

2593
02:16:56,446 --> 02:16:59,066
You don't usually
ask my advice.

2594
02:16:59,157 --> 02:17:02,577
Yes, well,
there doesn't appear to be
anyone else right now.

2595
02:17:02,661 --> 02:17:04,791
Very well, John.
What is it?

2596
02:17:05,539 --> 02:17:08,959
The entire South
has just walked out
of this Congress,

2597
02:17:09,584 --> 02:17:13,554
George Washington
is on the verge
of total annihilation,

2598
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:16,630
and the precious cause
for which l have labored
these several years

2599
02:17:16,716 --> 02:17:18,466
has come to nothing.

2600
02:17:20,428 --> 02:17:23,888
And it seems
that l'm obnoxious
and disliked.

2601
02:17:23,974 --> 02:17:25,604
Nonsense, John.

2602
02:17:26,351 --> 02:17:28,811
That l am unwilling
to face reality.

2603
02:17:28,895 --> 02:17:31,015
Foolishness, John.

2604
02:17:31,106 --> 02:17:32,816
That l'm pigheaded.

2605
02:17:33,441 --> 02:17:35,231
Ah, well, there you
have me, John.

2606
02:17:35,318 --> 02:17:37,358
I'm afraid
you are pigheaded.
(CHUCKLES)

2607
02:17:41,283 --> 02:17:42,623
Well, yes.

2608
02:17:45,203 --> 02:17:46,503
Oh, Abby.

2609
02:17:47,956 --> 02:17:50,666
Has it been any kind
of a life for you?

2610
02:17:51,543 --> 02:17:53,793
God knows
l haven't given you
very much.

2611
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:56,551
l never asked for more.

2612
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:59,260
After all,
l am Mrs. John Adams.

2613
02:17:59,342 --> 02:18:01,892
That's quite a lot
for one lifetime.

2614
02:18:04,181 --> 02:18:05,601
ls it, Abby?

2615
02:18:06,391 --> 02:18:08,391
Well, think of it, John.
To be married to the man

2616
02:18:08,476 --> 02:18:11,556
who is always the first
in line to be hanged. . .

2617
02:18:11,646 --> 02:18:13,146
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

2618
02:18:15,901 --> 02:18:17,821
Yes. The agitator.

2619
02:18:20,363 --> 02:18:21,703
Why, Abby?

2620
02:18:23,783 --> 02:18:26,203
You must tell me
what it is. l. . .

2621
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:30,120
Well, l have always
been dissatisfied.
l know that.

2622
02:18:31,625 --> 02:18:36,205
But lately,
l find that l reek
of discontentment.

2623
02:18:36,296 --> 02:18:39,626
lt fills my throat
and it floods my brain.

2624
02:18:42,886 --> 02:18:43,886
(SlGHS)

2625
02:18:43,970 --> 02:18:46,890
Sometimes l fear there
is no longer a dream,

2626
02:18:48,183 --> 02:18:50,313
but only
the discontentment.

2627
02:18:52,437 --> 02:18:53,847
Oh, John.

2628
02:18:56,274 --> 02:18:59,284
Can you really know
so little about yourself?

2629
02:19:00,862 --> 02:19:02,152
Can you think
so little of me

2630
02:19:02,239 --> 02:19:05,619
that you'd believe
l'd marry the man
you've described?

2631
02:19:07,786 --> 02:19:11,366
Have you forgotten
what you used to say
to me? l haven't.

2632
02:19:12,749 --> 02:19:14,829
"Commitment, Abby.

2633
02:19:15,919 --> 02:19:17,289
"Commitment.

2634
02:19:18,755 --> 02:19:22,755
"There are only
two creatures of value
on the face of this Earth.

2635
02:19:23,843 --> 02:19:26,013
"Those with a commitment,

2636
02:19:26,096 --> 02:19:29,266
"and those who require
the commitment of others."

2637
02:19:31,434 --> 02:19:33,274
Do you remember, John?

2638
02:19:35,522 --> 02:19:37,112
Yes, l remember.

2639
02:19:37,732 --> 02:19:39,652
McNAlR: Mr. Adams!

2640
02:19:39,943 --> 02:19:40,943
Mmm.

2641
02:19:41,278 --> 02:19:43,608
Are you up there,
Mr. Adams?

2642
02:19:44,281 --> 02:19:45,951
What do you want?

2643
02:19:46,366 --> 02:19:50,156
There's a delivery
down here for you.

2644
02:19:50,245 --> 02:19:51,615
What is it?

2645
02:19:53,498 --> 02:19:55,708
Where did it come from?
Who sent it?

2646
02:20:01,965 --> 02:20:06,585
Compliments
of the Concord Ladies'
Coffee CIub

2647
02:20:06,678 --> 02:20:11,558
And the Sisterhood
of the Truro Synagogue

2648
02:20:11,641 --> 02:20:16,521
And the Friday Evening
Baptist Sewing Circle

2649
02:20:16,604 --> 02:20:21,574
And the Holy Christian
Sisters of St. CIaire

2650
02:20:21,651 --> 02:20:25,651
All for you

2651
02:20:25,739 --> 02:20:28,869
John

2652
02:20:28,950 --> 02:20:34,370
I am as I ever was

2653
02:20:34,456 --> 02:20:39,336
And ever shaII be

2654
02:20:39,419 --> 02:20:44,919
Yours, yours, yours

2655
02:20:45,008 --> 02:20:47,628
Yours

2656
02:20:47,719 --> 02:20:50,969
Abigail, what's in these kegs?

2657
02:20:51,473 --> 02:20:58,023
Saltpeter, John

2658
02:21:05,862 --> 02:21:07,032
McNair!

2659
02:21:07,906 --> 02:21:11,116
McNair, go out and
buy every damned pin
you can find in Philadelphia.

2660
02:21:11,201 --> 02:21:12,951
Pin?
What sort of pin?

2661
02:21:13,036 --> 02:21:15,946
Well, l don't know.
Whatever the ladies
use for their sewing.

2662
02:21:16,039 --> 02:21:19,459
Franklin, Jefferson,
what are you all
sitting around for?

2663
02:21:19,542 --> 02:21:21,252
Didn't you hear
a word l said before?

2664
02:21:21,336 --> 02:21:23,086
Oh, never mind
about that.

2665
02:21:23,171 --> 02:21:24,801
Now, here's what
l want you to do.

2666
02:21:24,881 --> 02:21:27,091
John, l'm not even
speaking to you.

2667
02:21:27,175 --> 02:21:29,925
lt's too late
for that, damn it.
There's work to be done.

2668
02:21:30,011 --> 02:21:31,851
Jefferson,
go find Rutledge.

2669
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:33,890
Don't come back until
you've worn him down.

2670
02:21:33,973 --> 02:21:35,893
Now, you're both
Southern aristocrats.

2671
02:21:35,975 --> 02:21:38,055
lf he'll listen
to anybody,
he'll listen to you.

2672
02:21:38,144 --> 02:21:40,064
Franklin,
out of that chair!

2673
02:21:40,146 --> 02:21:42,766
What good is the South
if you can't deliver
Pennsylvania, hmm?

2674
02:21:42,857 --> 02:21:44,437
Talk to Wilson.

2675
02:21:44,526 --> 02:21:45,776
Get him away
from Dickinson.

2676
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:49,030
That's the only way to do it.
Go on, now, both of you.

2677
02:21:49,239 --> 02:21:50,239
John. . .

2678
02:21:50,323 --> 02:21:51,743
Time's running out,
damn it.

2679
02:21:52,617 --> 02:21:53,907
Now move.

2680
02:21:57,288 --> 02:21:58,828
l'm still
from Massachusetts, John.

2681
02:22:00,792 --> 02:22:02,712
You know where l stand.

2682
02:22:03,169 --> 02:22:04,499
l'll do whatever you say.

2683
02:22:08,049 --> 02:22:09,219
No.

2684
02:22:10,510 --> 02:22:13,100
No, you're the president
of Congress.

2685
02:22:14,347 --> 02:22:17,057
You're a fair man, Hancock.
Stay that way.

2686
02:22:19,436 --> 02:22:20,806
(FOOTSTEPS)

2687
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:42,790
Tell me, Mr. Thomson,
out of curiosity,

2688
02:22:43,501 --> 02:22:47,091
do you stand
with Mr. Dickinson,
or do you stand with me?

2689
02:22:49,048 --> 02:22:51,048
l stand
with the General.

2690
02:22:52,969 --> 02:22:57,259
Well, lately,
l've had the oddest
feeling that he's been

2691
02:22:57,348 --> 02:22:58,848
writing to me.

2692
02:23:02,937 --> 02:23:05,937
I have been
in expectation

2693
02:23:06,024 --> 02:23:09,234
Of receiving a reply

2694
02:23:09,319 --> 02:23:15,489
On the subject of
my last 1 5 dispatches

2695
02:23:16,659 --> 02:23:21,909
ls anybody there?

2696
02:23:23,082 --> 02:23:28,672
Does anybody care?

2697
02:23:29,839 --> 02:23:35,259
Does anybody care?

2698
02:23:37,430 --> 02:23:39,850
"Your humble
and obedient. . ."

2699
02:24:13,091 --> 02:24:14,761
"ls anybody there?

"Does anybody care?"

02:24:24,352 --> 02:24:30,862
Does anybody see
what I see?

2703
02:24:34,571 --> 02:24:36,911
They want me to quit

2704
02:24:37,907 --> 02:24:42,237
They say,
"John, give up the fight"

2705
02:24:42,328 --> 02:24:45,408
Still to England, l say

2706
02:24:45,498 --> 02:24:48,918
Good night,
forever, good night!

2707
02:24:49,919 --> 02:24:54,589
For I have crossed
the Rubicon

2708
02:24:54,674 --> 02:24:57,474
Let the bridge
be burned behind me

2709
02:24:57,552 --> 02:25:02,012
Come what may

2710
02:25:02,098 --> 02:25:03,178
Commitment!

2711
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:07,850
The croakers all say
we'll rue the day

2712
02:25:07,937 --> 02:25:13,187
There'll be hell to pay
in fiery purgatory

2713

Through all the gloom,
through all the gloom

2714
02:25:17,113 --> 02:25:21,073
l can see the rays
of ravishing light

2715

And glory

02:25:27,206 --> 02:25:29,626
Does anybody care?

Does anybody see what l see?

2719
02:25:34,505 --> 02:25:36,465
I see fireworks

2720
02:25:37,175 --> 02:25:40,505
l see the pageant
and pomp and parade

2721
02:25:40,595 --> 02:25:43,055
l hear the bells ringing out

2722
02:25:43,139 --> 02:25:46,269
I hear the cannons roar

2723
02:25:46,351 --> 02:25:48,891
I see Americans

2724
02:25:48,978 --> 02:25:52,398
AII Americans free

2725
02:25:52,482 --> 02:25:55,732
Forevermore

2726
02:26:08,665 --> 02:26:14,205
How quiet,
how quiet the chamber is

2727
02:26:15,505 --> 02:26:22,335
How silent,
how siIent the chamber is

2728
02:26:26,099 --> 02:26:31,479
ls anybody there?

2729
02:26:32,855 --> 02:26:38,025
Does anybody care?

2730
02:26:39,904 --> 02:26:45,244
Does anybody
see what I see?

2731
02:26:46,869 --> 02:26:48,409
HALL: Yes, Mr. Adams.

2732
02:26:50,415 --> 02:26:51,575
l do.

2733
02:26:55,378 --> 02:26:56,668
Dr. Hall.

2734
02:26:57,463 --> 02:26:59,553
l didn't know anyone was. . .

2735
02:27:00,675 --> 02:27:02,795
l'm sorry if l startled you.

2736
02:27:03,678 --> 02:27:05,298
l couldn't sleep.

2737
02:27:06,347 --> 02:27:09,767
And in trying
to resolve my dilemma,

2738
02:27:09,851 --> 02:27:12,771
l remembered something
l'd once read.

2739
02:27:12,854 --> 02:27:16,654
That a representative
owes the people
not only his industry,

2740
02:27:16,733 --> 02:27:19,233
but his judgment.

2741
02:27:19,318 --> 02:27:22,778
And he betrays them
if he sacrifices it
to their opinion.

2742
02:27:25,908 --> 02:27:28,288
That was written
by Edmund Burke,

2743
02:27:29,829 --> 02:27:32,329
a member of
the British Parliament.

2744
02:28:01,277 --> 02:28:03,197
Good night,
Mr. Adams.

2745
02:28:03,279 --> 02:28:04,609
Good night.

2746
02:28:15,708 --> 02:28:17,418
FRANKLlN:
It's never been done before.

2747
02:28:17,502 --> 02:28:20,092
No colony has ever broken
from the parent stem
in the history of the world.

2748
02:28:20,171 --> 02:28:22,841
DlCKlNSON:
lf you have grievances,
and l'm sure you have,

2749
02:28:22,924 --> 02:28:24,474
our present system
must provide

2750
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:26,050
a gentler means
of redressing them

2751
02:28:26,135 --> 02:28:27,085
short of revoIution.

2752
02:28:27,178 --> 02:28:28,258
FRANKLlN: We've spawned
a new race here.

2753
02:28:28,346 --> 02:28:29,546
Rougher, simpler,

2754
02:28:29,639 --> 02:28:32,349
more violent,
more enterprising,
Iess refined.

2755
02:28:32,433 --> 02:28:35,893
THOMSON: "My quartermaster
has no food, no arms,
no ammunition,

2756
02:28:35,978 --> 02:28:38,438
"and my troops are in
a state of near mutiny."

2757
02:28:38,564 --> 02:28:40,824
DlCKlNSON: No army, no navy...
THOMSON: "l pray God
some reIief arrives

2758
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:41,900
"before the armada,
but fear it wiII not."

2759
02:28:41,984 --> 02:28:43,074
DlCKlNSON: ...no arms,
no ammunition,

2760
02:28:43,152 --> 02:28:44,152
no treasury, no friends.

2761
02:28:44,237 --> 02:28:46,067
RUTLEDGE: And when
they hang you, Mr. Adams,

2762
02:28:46,155 --> 02:28:48,655
l do hope you'll
put in a good word
for the rest of us.

2763
02:28:48,741 --> 02:28:51,871
RODNEY: England closing in,
cutting off our air.

2764
02:28:51,953 --> 02:28:52,953
There's no time!

2765
02:28:53,037 --> 02:28:56,207
JEFFERSON: To place before
mankind the common sense
of the subject...

2766
02:28:56,290 --> 02:28:58,580
FRANKLlN: The issue here
is independence.

2767
02:28:58,668 --> 02:29:00,538
Perhaps you've lost
sight of that fact,
but I have not.

2768
02:29:00,628 --> 02:29:02,248
THOMSON: "We mutually pledge
to each other our Iives

2769
02:29:02,338 --> 02:29:05,338
"our fortunes
and our sacred honor."

2770
02:29:06,092 --> 02:29:09,092
ABlGAlL: Can you really know
so little about yourself?

2771
02:29:14,141 --> 02:29:15,481
Very well.

2772
02:29:17,395 --> 02:29:20,475
The Congress will now
vote on Virginia's
resolution on independence.

2773
02:29:20,565 --> 02:29:21,565
(DOOR OPENS)

2774
02:29:24,151 --> 02:29:25,361
(SlGHS)

2775
02:29:29,574 --> 02:29:30,824
Thank you for coming,
Caesar.

2776
02:29:31,784 --> 02:29:33,544
God bless you,
sir.

2777
02:29:39,041 --> 02:29:41,211
The secretary
will call the roll.

2778
02:29:41,294 --> 02:29:44,254
And l remind you, gentlemen,

2779
02:29:44,338 --> 02:29:46,508
that a single "nay" vote

2780
02:29:47,633 --> 02:29:49,553
will defeat the motion.

2781
02:29:50,845 --> 02:29:52,215
Mr. Thomson.

2782
02:29:57,393 --> 02:29:58,893
New Hampshire?

2783
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:00,440
New Hampshire
says yea.

2784
02:30:00,521 --> 02:30:03,021
New Hampshire
says yea.
Massachusetts?

2785
02:30:03,107 --> 02:30:04,267
Massachusetts
says yea.

2786
02:30:04,358 --> 02:30:06,738
Massachusetts
says yea.
Rhode lsland?

2787
02:30:06,819 --> 02:30:08,149
Rhode lsland
says yea.

2788
02:30:08,237 --> 02:30:10,777
Rhode lsland
says yea.
Connecticut?

2789
02:30:10,865 --> 02:30:12,065
Connecticut
says yea.

2790
02:30:12,158 --> 02:30:14,948
Connecticut
says yea.
New York?

2791
02:30:15,036 --> 02:30:18,286
Mr. Secretary,
New York
abstains courteously.

2792
02:30:18,372 --> 02:30:19,502
New York abstains.

2793
02:30:19,582 --> 02:30:20,712
Courteously.

2794
02:30:22,126 --> 02:30:23,666
New Jersey?

2795
02:30:23,753 --> 02:30:25,053
New Jersey
says yea.

2796
02:30:25,129 --> 02:30:27,709
New Jersey
says yea.
Pennsylvania?

2797
02:30:29,717 --> 02:30:31,887
Mr. Secretary,
Pennsylvania
is not ready.

2798
02:30:31,969 --> 02:30:34,179
Please come back
to us later.

2799
02:30:34,263 --> 02:30:36,513
THOMSON:
Pennsylvania passes.
Delaware?

2800
02:30:36,599 --> 02:30:37,639
Just a moment.

2801
02:30:38,684 --> 02:30:41,944
Delaware,
by majority vote. . .

2802
02:30:42,521 --> 02:30:43,521
Aye.

2803
02:30:43,606 --> 02:30:45,186
. . .says yea.

2804
02:30:45,274 --> 02:30:48,234
Delaware says yea.
Maryland?

2805
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:49,529
Maryland
says yea.

2806
02:30:49,612 --> 02:30:51,242
Maryland says yea.
Virginia?

2807
02:30:51,322 --> 02:30:52,362
Virginia
says yea.

2808
02:30:52,448 --> 02:30:54,528
Virginia says yea.
North Carolina?

2809
02:30:54,617 --> 02:30:57,367
North Carolina yields
to South Carolina.

2810
02:30:58,621 --> 02:30:59,621
South Carolina?

2811
02:31:00,623 --> 02:31:02,293
Well,
Mr. Adams?

2812
02:31:03,417 --> 02:31:04,707
Well,
Mr. Rutledge.

2813
02:31:07,797 --> 02:31:09,127
Mr. Adams,

2814
02:31:11,634 --> 02:31:15,604
you must believe
that l will do
what l promised to do.

2815
02:31:22,353 --> 02:31:23,943
What is it you want,
Rutledge?

2816
02:31:24,021 --> 02:31:27,651
Remove the offending passage
from your declaration.

2817
02:31:28,025 --> 02:31:30,145
lf we did that,
we would be guilty

2818
02:31:30,236 --> 02:31:33,146
of what we ourselves
are rebelling against.

2819
02:31:35,116 --> 02:31:37,326
Nevertheless remove it,

2820
02:31:38,077 --> 02:31:41,157
or South Carolina
will bury now and forever

2821
02:31:41,247 --> 02:31:43,327
your dream of independence.

2822
02:31:44,375 --> 02:31:47,835
John, l beg you,
consider what
you're doing.

2823
02:31:54,802 --> 02:31:56,432
Mark me, Franklin,

2824
02:31:57,555 --> 02:32:00,015
if we give in
on this issue,

2825
02:32:00,099 --> 02:32:02,599
posterity will
never forgive us.

2826
02:32:02,685 --> 02:32:04,765
That's probably true,
but we won't hear a thing.

2827
02:32:04,854 --> 02:32:06,944
We'll be long gone.

2828
02:32:07,023 --> 02:32:11,363
Besides, what will
posterity think we were?
Demigods?

2829
02:32:12,028 --> 02:32:13,608
We're men, no more,
no less,

2830
02:32:13,696 --> 02:32:16,566
trying to get
a nation started
against greater odds

2831
02:32:16,657 --> 02:32:19,527
than a more generous God
would have allowed.

2832
02:32:20,161 --> 02:32:23,411
First things first, John.
lndependence. America.

2833
02:32:23,497 --> 02:32:25,957
lf we don't secure that,

2834
02:32:26,042 --> 02:32:28,542
what difference
will the rest make?

2835
02:32:34,675 --> 02:32:36,675
Jefferson,
say something.

2836
02:32:39,138 --> 02:32:41,138
What else is there
to do?

2837
02:32:42,058 --> 02:32:44,808
Well, man,
you're the one
that wrote it.

2838
02:32:45,686 --> 02:32:48,806
l wrote all of it,
Mr. Adams.

2839
02:33:10,086 --> 02:33:11,286
There.

2840
02:33:11,378 --> 02:33:14,088
There it is, Rutledge.
You have your slavery.
Little good may it do you.

2841
02:33:14,173 --> 02:33:16,093
You now vote,
damn you !

2842
02:33:17,676 --> 02:33:21,466
Mr. President,
the fair colony
of South Carolina

2843
02:33:22,765 --> 02:33:24,345
says yea.

2844
02:33:24,433 --> 02:33:25,933
South Carolina
says yea.

2845
02:33:26,018 --> 02:33:29,558
North Carolina
says yea.

2846
02:33:31,107 --> 02:33:32,187
Georgia?

2847
02:33:32,274 --> 02:33:35,284
Georgia
says yea.

2848
02:33:36,612 --> 02:33:38,402
Pennsylvania, second call.

2849
02:33:40,449 --> 02:33:42,279
Mr. President,

2850
02:33:42,368 --> 02:33:45,538
Pennsylvania regrets
all of the inconvenience

2851
02:33:45,621 --> 02:33:50,671
that such distinguished
men as Adams,
Franklin and Jefferson

2852
02:33:50,751 --> 02:33:52,591
were put to
just now.

2853
02:33:52,670 --> 02:33:54,460
They might've kept
their document intact

2854
02:33:54,547 --> 02:33:57,127
for all the difference
it will make.

2855
02:33:57,216 --> 02:33:58,836
Mr. President,

2856
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:00,640
Pennsylvania says. . .

2857
02:34:00,719 --> 02:34:01,799
Just a moment.

2858
02:34:03,472 --> 02:34:05,472
l ask the delegation
to be polled.

2859
02:34:06,225 --> 02:34:08,345
Dr. Franklin,
don't be absurd.

2860
02:34:08,811 --> 02:34:11,811
A poll, Mr. President.
lt's a proper request.

2861
02:34:12,064 --> 02:34:13,234
HANCOCK: Yes, it is.

2862
02:34:13,315 --> 02:34:15,605
Poll the delegation,
Mr. Thomson.

2863
02:34:15,693 --> 02:34:17,403
THOMSON:
Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

2864
02:34:17,486 --> 02:34:18,526
Yea.

2865
02:34:18,612 --> 02:34:20,572
THOMSON:
Mr. John Dickinson.

2866
02:34:20,656 --> 02:34:22,026
Nay.

2867
02:34:22,116 --> 02:34:23,736
THOMSON:
Mr. James Wilson.

2868
02:34:26,954 --> 02:34:28,414
Judge Wilson?

2869
02:34:31,584 --> 02:34:34,174
There it is,
Mr. Wilson. lt's all
up to you now.

2870
02:34:34,253 --> 02:34:35,923
The whole question
of American independence

2871
02:34:36,005 --> 02:34:38,585
rests squarely
on your shoulders.

2872
02:34:38,674 --> 02:34:42,224
An entirely new nation
ready to be born
or to die at birth,

2873
02:34:42,303 --> 02:34:44,013
all on
your say-so.

2874
02:34:45,139 --> 02:34:47,349
Which will it be,
Mr. Wilson?

2875
02:34:47,808 --> 02:34:51,348
Every mapmaker in
the world is waiting
for your decision.

2876
02:34:51,979 --> 02:34:55,109
Come now, James.
Nothing has changed.

2877
02:34:55,191 --> 02:34:57,941
We mustn't let
Dr. Franklin create
one of his confusions.

2878
02:34:58,027 --> 02:34:59,897
The question
is clear.

2879
02:35:00,404 --> 02:35:03,954
Most questions are clear
when someone else
has to decide them.

2880
02:35:04,033 --> 02:35:05,493
lt would be a pity
for a man

2881
02:35:05,576 --> 02:35:08,116
who's handed down
hundreds of wise decisions

2882
02:35:08,204 --> 02:35:10,044
from the bench

2883
02:35:10,122 --> 02:35:13,292
to be remembered only
for the one unwise decision

2884
02:35:13,375 --> 02:35:15,165
he made in Congress.

2885
02:35:16,629 --> 02:35:19,589
James, you're keeping
everybody waiting.

2886
02:35:19,673 --> 02:35:21,723
The secretary has
called for your vote.

2887
02:35:22,593 --> 02:35:23,803
Please.

2888
02:35:25,137 --> 02:35:28,717
Don't push me, John.
l know what you
want me to do.

2889
02:35:31,477 --> 02:35:34,267
But Mr. Adams is correct
about one thing.

2890
02:35:36,774 --> 02:35:39,534
l'm the one who'll
be remembered for it.

2891
02:35:39,818 --> 02:35:40,898
What do you mean?

2892
02:35:46,617 --> 02:35:48,827
l'm different from you, John.

2893
02:35:49,662 --> 02:35:52,412
l'm different from
most of the men here.

2894
02:35:53,374 --> 02:35:55,584
l don't want
to be remembered.

2895
02:35:56,835 --> 02:35:58,795
l just don't want the

2896
02:35:59,630 --> 02:36:01,170
responsibility.

2897
02:36:02,299 --> 02:36:04,799
Yes, well, whether you
want it or not, James,

2898
02:36:04,885 --> 02:36:07,135
there's no way
of avoiding it.

2899
02:36:07,221 --> 02:36:09,101
Not necessarily, John.

2900
02:36:09,765 --> 02:36:11,765
lf l go with them,

2901
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:14,100
l'll just be one among dozens.

2902
02:36:15,938 --> 02:36:19,188
No one will ever remember
the name of James Wilson.

2903
02:36:20,567 --> 02:36:22,437
But if l vote with you,

2904
02:36:23,946 --> 02:36:27,276
l'll be the man
who prevented
American independence.

2905
02:36:30,119 --> 02:36:31,739
l'm sorry, John.

2906
02:36:33,163 --> 02:36:35,463
l just didn't
bargain for that.

2907
02:36:37,042 --> 02:36:40,462
And is that how new
nations are formed?

2908
02:36:41,880 --> 02:36:44,380
By a nonentity
trying to preserve

2909
02:36:44,466 --> 02:36:47,756
the anonymity he
so richly deserves?

2910
02:36:48,637 --> 02:36:50,007

into this world

2911
02:36:50,097 --> 02:36:52,057
like bastard children,
Mr. Dickinson.

2912
02:36:52,141 --> 02:36:54,731
Half improvised
and half compromised.

2913
02:36:54,810 --> 02:36:57,230
Our side
has provided
the compromise.

2914
02:36:57,313 --> 02:36:59,983
Now Judge Wilson
is supplying
the rest.

2915

James.

2916
02:37:06,864 --> 02:37:08,494

ready to be signed?

2927
02:37:45,861 --> 02:37:47,491
lt is.

2928
02:37:47,571 --> 02:37:49,531
Then l suggest
we do so.

2929
02:37:51,367 --> 02:37:53,027
And the chair
further proposes,

2930
02:37:53,118 --> 02:37:55,828
for our
mutual security
and protection,

2931
02:37:57,748 --> 02:37:59,708
that no man
be allowed to sit
in this Congress

2932
02:37:59,792 --> 02:38:02,092
without attaching
his name to it.

2933
02:38:05,130 --> 02:38:08,010
l'm sorry, Mr. President.

2934
02:38:09,468 --> 02:38:13,758
l cannot,
in good conscience,
sign such a document.

2935
02:38:15,391 --> 02:38:19,641
l will never stop hoping
for our eventual
reconciliation with England.

than does Mr. Adams,

2939
02:38:32,825 --> 02:38:36,695
l will join the army

2940

that fight to be hopeless.

Yes. Uh, Mr. Jefferson,

2952
02:39:19,997 --> 02:39:24,127
it so happens that
the word is "unalienable,"

2953
02:39:24,209 --> 02:39:25,999
not "inalienable."

2954
02:39:27,713 --> 02:39:31,803

but "inalienable"
is correct.
