1
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,399
Emily?

2
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,333
Emily!

3
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:45,634
Come, little children

4
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:49,906
I'll take thee away

5
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:53,039
- Into a land
- Emily!

6
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,781
Of enchantment

7
00:01:57,922 --> 00:02:01,155
Come, little children

8
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:05,425
- The time's come to say
- Elijah! Elijah!

9
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:08,459
- Hast thou seen my sister Emily?
- Nay.

10
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:11,391
But look. They conjure.

11
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,431
Oh, God. The woods!

12
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,137
Emily!

13
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:27,975
- She's done for.
- Not yet!

14
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:31,316
You wake my father.
Summon the elders. Go!

15
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:38,726
Emily!

16
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,689
Come, child.

17
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,000
- Ahh.
- Oh, yes.

18
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:46,539
- Emily.
- Huh?

19
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:05,583
Oh, look.
Another glorious morning.

20
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:09,387
It makes me sick!

21
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,862
- Sisters!
- Yes, Winnie.
- We're coming, Winnie.

22
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:14,262
Right away. Sorry.

23
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,699
Must've been an imp.

24
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:21,400
My darling.
My little book.

25
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,413
We must continue with our spell now that
our little guest of honor has arrived.

26
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,916
Wake up. Wake up, darling.

27
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:34,390
Yes. Oh, come along, darling.
There you are.

28
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,961
- Mary!
- Right here, Winnie, right here.

29
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:39,759
- Sorry.
- Hello. Hello.

30
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:43,963
- I've noticed sister Sarah isn't helping.
- I lured the child here.

31
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:47,506
Leave her be.
She hath done her chore.

32
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,439
- You're right, I'm wrong.
- Mmm.

33
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:52,014
All right.

34
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,935
'Tis time!

35
00:04:56,211 --> 00:05:01,514
There it is: '' Bring to a full rolling
bubble. Add two drops oil of boil.''

36
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,018
Ah-ah-ah. I got it. It's heavy.
You do that, I'll do this.

37
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:15,159
'' Mix blood of owl
with the herb that's red.

38
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:18,465
Turn three times,
pluck a hair from my head.

39
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:22,134
Add a dash of pox
and a dead man's toe.''

40
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:26,305
- Dead man's toe, and make it a fleshy one.
- Dead man's toe!

41
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,318
Deadman's toe
Add a deadman's toe

42
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,820
Deadman's toe
Deadman's t--

43
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,325
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead

44
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:35,825
D-- Ooh!

45
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,826
- Uh-oh. Deadman's toe
- Fresh one.

46
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,729
- Deadman, deadman
- Deadman's toe, add a--

47
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,230
Will you two stop that!
I need to concentrate!

48
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:54,568
Sorry, uh--

49
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,178
She needs to concentrate.

50
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,022
''Green newt saliva.''

51
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:13,691
- I-I smell a child.
- Ehh, what dost thou call that?

52
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,860
- A child.
- Hmph!

53
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,064
Sisters, gather 'round.

54
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:22,039
- One thing more, and all is done.
- Yes?

55
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:25,113
Add a bit of thine own tongue.

56
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:32,084
Oh, Winnie, thou art divine.

57
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,952
'Tis ready for tasting.

58
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:39,758
One drop of this
and her life will be mine.

59
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,300
- I mean, ours.
- Yeah.

60
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,627
All right, girl.

61
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:51,134
Open up your mouth.

62
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,399
- No!
- A boy!

63
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:58,310
- Get him, you fools!
- I got him. I knew I smelled a boy!

64
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,915
I got him. Come on. Come on.

65
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,416
- Get away!
- Here you go.

66
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:04,419
- Get away from my potion!
- Ohh!

67
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,159
Ohh!

68
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,100
- Winnie!
- My potion!

69
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,134
Emily!

70
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,609
Hmm. Hmm.

71
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:34,651
Winnie. Winnie.

72
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:37,786
- Look.
- Ahh!

73
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:40,662
Sisters, prepare thyselves.

74
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:44,193
'Tis her life force.
The potion works!

75
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:47,993
Take my hands.
We will share her.

76
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,797
Oh, Winnie,
how generous of thee.

77
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,889
Sisters, behold!

78
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:18,404
I am beautiful!
Boys will love me!

79
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:21,898
We’re young!

80
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:25,905
Well, younger.

81
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,913
But it's a start!

82
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,217
Sisters!

83
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,056
Winifred, thou art
a mere sprig of a girl.

84
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:37,652
Liar! But I shall be
a sprig forever,

85
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:42,249
once I suck the life out of
all the children in Salem!

86
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:45,021
Let's brew another batch!

87
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,262
You hag! There are not enough
children in the world to make
thee young and beautiful!

88
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:52,199
- Hag.
- Uh-oh.

89
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:56,402
Sisters, did you hear
what he called you?

90
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,375
Whatever shall we do with him?

91
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,245
Let's barbecue and fillet him.

92
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:05,185
- Hang him on a hook
and let me play with him?
- No!

93
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,090
Book, darling, come to Mommy.

94
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:12,960
Yes. His punishment
must be more fulsome,

95
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,125
more lingering.

96
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:18,797
Dazzle me, my darling.

97
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,910
Let's see: amnesia, bunions,
chilblains, cholera.

98
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,639
- We can do better than that, I think.
- Yes.

99
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,715
Let's see what we have. Oh!

100
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,378
Ahh. Perfect.

101
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,913
As usual.

102
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:37,282
- His punishment shall not be to die,
- No?

103
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,380
but to live forever
with his guilt.

104
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:45,225
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- Jump back!

105
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,764
Twist the bones
and bend the back.

106
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,927
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

107
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:52,164
Trim him of his baby fat.

108
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,434
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a,
Mel-a-ka-mys-tic-a.

109
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,773
Give him fur,
black as black.

110
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,347
- Just...
- Like...
- This.

111
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:19,767
- Open!
- Witches!

112
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,866
Daughters of darkness!
Open this door!

113
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,502
- Hide the child!
- The child!
- Come on!

114
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:28,665
Witches? Uh, there be
no witches here, sir!

115
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,676
Don't get your knickers
in a twist!

116
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:34,806
We are just three kindly
old spinster ladies!

117
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,818
Uh, spending a quiet
evening at home!

118
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,322
Sucking the lives
out of little children!

119
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:44,151
- Winifred Sanderson?
- Yes?

120
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:46,663
I will ask thee one final time.

121
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:49,666
- Yes?
- What hast thou done
with my son Thackery?

122
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:51,999
- Thackery. Mmm.
- Answer me!

123
00:10:52,106 --> 00:10:54,802
- Well, I don't know.
- Speak!

124
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,878
Cat's got my tongue.

125
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,755
This is-- This is
terribly uncomfortable.

126
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,917
Sisters, sing.

127
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:16,065
Thrice I with mercury purify
and spit upon the 12 tables

128
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:19,537
- Don't listen! Cover your ears!
- Listen to them not!

129
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:26,535
Ah! Fools! All of you!

130
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,733
My ungodly book speaks to you.

131
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,209
On All Hallows Eve
when the moon is round,

132
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:35,273
a virgin will summon us
from under the ground.

133
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:38,216
Ohh! Ohhh! We shall be back!

134
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:41,621
And the lives of all
the children shall be mine!

135
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,488
Away!

136
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:08,751
Away, beast!

137
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,231
Poor Thackery Binx.

138
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,963
Neither his father, his mother,
nor anyone else...

139
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,429
ever knew what became of him...

140
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,991
those 3OO years ago.

141
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:28,234
And so the Sanderson Sisters...

142
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:32,302
were hanged
by the Salem town folk.

143
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:35,939
Now, there are those who say
that on Halloween night...

144
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:41,650
a black cat still guards
the old Sanderson house,

145
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:46,128
warning off any who
might make the witches...

146
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,792
come back to life!

147
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,168
Gimme a break.

148
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:59,111
Aha. We seem to have
a sceptic in our midst.

149
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:01,307
Mr. Dennison,
would you care to share...

150
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,855
your California, laid-back,
tie-dyed point of view?

151
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,386
Okay.

152
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,519
Granted that, uh,
you guys here in Salem...

153
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:13,724
are all into these, uh, black
cats and witches and stuff.

154
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:16,156
- Stuff?
- Fine.

155
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:19,823
But everyone here knows that Halloween
was invented by the candy companies.

156
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,458
- Ohh!
- It's a conspiracy.

157
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,130
It just so happens that
Halloween is based...

158
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,140
on the ancient feast
called All Hallows Eve.

159
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,871
It's the one night of they ear
where the spirits of the dead
can return to Earth.

160
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:37,678
Well said, Allison.

161
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:45,722
Well, in case Jimi Hendrix shows
up tonight, here's my number.

162
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:53,607
Come on, let's go.

163
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,038
- Hey, wait up.
- Did he call you?

164
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:57,042
- Yeah.
- Well, what did he say?

165
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:59,706
Max. Fat chance.

166
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:24,966
- Allison.
- Hi.

167
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:29,769
Hi. Look, um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you in class.

168
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,107
You didn't.

169
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:35,114
- My name is Max Dennison.
- Yeah, I know.
You just moved here, huh?

170
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,244
- Yeah, last week.
- Must be a big change for you.

171
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,414
Yeah, that's for sure.

172
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:44,929
- You don't like it here?
- Oh, the leaves are great, but--

173
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,762
- I-I don't know.
just all this Halloween stuff.
- You don't believe in it?

174
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:52,270
What, do you mean, like,
the Sanderson Sisters? No way.

175
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,501
- Not even on Halloween?
- Especially not on Halloween.

176
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:59,943
Trick or treat.

177
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:13,452
- Hey, Christie, wait for me.
- No, I don't think so.
- I'm coming!

178
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,794
Halt! Who are you?

179
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,168
Max. I just moved here.

180
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:56,209
- From where?
- Los Angeles.

181
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,679
- L.A.?
- Ohh!

182
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:05,234
- Dude!
- Tubular.

183
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,575
I'm Jay. This is Ernie.

184
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,488
How many times I gotta tell you,
my name ain't Ernie no more.

185
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,353
- It's Ice.
- Oh.
- Ice.

186
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,562
This is Ice.

187
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:28,363
So, let's have a butt.

188
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:30,274
Ah, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

189
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,778
They're very health conscious
in Los Angeles.

190
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,887
You got any cash...

191
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:42,418
Hollywood?

192
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,222
- No.
- Gee.

193
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,133
We don't get any smokes from
you, we don't get any cash.

194
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,205
What am I supposed to do
with my afternoon?

195
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:56,107
Maybe you could learn to
breathe through your nose.

196
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,574
Whoa!

197
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:04,270
Check out
the new cross-trainers.

198
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,110
Cool. Let me try 'em on.

199
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,451
Ah-ah.

200
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,421
- Later, dude!
- See ya, Hollywood!

201
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:36,251
- Hey, Max! Hey, how was school?
- It sucked!

202
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:38,115
Hey, hey, hey,
watch your language.

203
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:44,125
I can't believe
you made me move here!

204
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,637
Huh. He wasn't wearing
any shoes.

205
00:17:53,964 --> 00:17:56,866
Well, must be
some form of protest.

206
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,885
Hey, guys.

207
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:31,838
Oh, Allison.

208
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:34,678
You're so soft.
I just wanna--

209
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:37,686
- Boo!
- Dani!

210
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,587
I scared you, I scared you!
Ha ha ha-ha ha!

211
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:48,861
I'm Allison. Allison.
Kiss me. I'm Allison!

212
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:51,222
Mom and Dad told you
to stay out of my room!

213
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:53,524
Don't be such a crab!

214
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,194
Guess what. You're gonna
take me trick-or-treating.

215
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,273
- Not this year, Dani.
- Mom said you have to.

216
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:03,706
- Well, she can take you.
- She and Dad are going to
a party at Town Hall.

217
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,780
Well, you're eight!
Go by yourself.

218
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:16,221
No way! This is my first time!
I'll get lost!

219
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:19,889
Besides, it's a full moon
outside! The weirdos are out!

220
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:29,069
Come on, Max. Couldn't you
forget about being a cool
teenager just for one night?

221
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:31,372
Please? Come on.

222
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,747
We used to have so much fun together
trick-or-treating. Remember?

223
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:38,151
It'll be like old times.

224
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:41,086
No. The old days are dead.

225
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:44,753
It doesn't matter what you say.
You're taking me!

226
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:46,754
Wanna bet?

227
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:58,231
Mom!

228
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:04,439
Let's go. Hurry up!
The bewitching hour is about to begin!

229
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:06,445
Wow-- Aah! Please help me!
Aah!

230
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:09,780
-Isn't that a scary witch?
-Stop! You look very scary. Wow!

231
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:15,153
What about you, Max?
What are you supposed to be?

232
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:17,420
- A rap singer.
- Oh.

233
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:19,429
Well, your hat should be
on sideways, shouldn't it?

234
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,467
- Say '' Halloween''!
- Halloween!
- Halloween!

235
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:28,039
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

236
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,718
- Lighten up, Max.
- Can we go home now?

237
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:39,721
No.

238
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,885
Let’s just go this way.

239
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:51,995
Dani.

240
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,866
Ding-ding. Ding-ding.

241
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,233
- Stop and pay the toll, kid.
- Ten chocolate bars. No licor ice.

242
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:03,672
- Dump out your sack.
- Drop dead. Moron.

243
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:06,009
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

244
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,343
Yo, twerp.

245
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:11,352
- How'd you like to be hung
off that telephone pole?
- Yeah!

246
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:16,518
I’d just like to see you try,
because it just so happens
I've got my big brother with me.

247
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:18,357
- Oooh!
- Max!

248
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:24,695
- Hollywood!
- Oh, no!

249
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:34,281
So, you're doing
a little trick-or-treating.

250
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,272
- Ding-dong.
- Whoo!

251
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:41,106
- I'm just taking
my little sister around.
- Mmm.

252
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,115
That's nice.

253
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:46,743
- Whoa! I love the costume!
- Yeah!

254
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,381
But what are you supposed to be?
A New Kid On The Block?

255
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,922
For your information,
he's a Little Leaguer.

256
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:57,227
- Whoa!
- Ooh, tough guy!
- I'm a Little Leaguer!

257
00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:58,734
Whoa!

258
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:02,541
Yeah!

259
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:06,580
- Wait a minute.
Everybody pays the toll.
- Stuff it, zitface.

260
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:08,411
- Why, you little--
- Hey!

261
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:11,749
Ice, here. Pig out.

262
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:13,915
Come on, Dani, let's go.

263
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,583
jerk.

264
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:18,287
And Hollywood,
the shoes fit great!

265
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,164
Yeah!

266
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,292
- Trick or treat!
- You should've punched him.

267
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:26,804
He would've killed me.

268
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,967
- At least you would've died like a man.
- Hey!

269
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,570
You just humiliated me in front
of half the guys at school!

270
00:22:36,677 --> 00:22:39,648
So collect your candy
and get out of my life!

271
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:41,977
I wanna go home now!

272
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,646
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!
- Hi. Hi. Ooh, there's plenty--

273
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:01,037
Dani, I'm sorry.

274
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:03,700
Trick or treat!

275
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:06,643
It's just that
I hate this place.

276
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,943
I miss all my friends.

277
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,019
I wanna go home!

278
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:14,554
Well, this is your home now,
so get used to it.

279
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:18,318
Yeah.

280
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,956
Trick or treat!

281
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,969
- Give me one more chance?
- Why should I?

282
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,965
Because I'm your brother.

283
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:39,345
Whoa. Check that out.

284
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:42,348
What?

285
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,681
Something just few
across the moon.

286
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,197
- Fooled ya.
- Let's go,jerkface.

287
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:55,857
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

288
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,868
- Wow!
- Wow!

289
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,939
Check out this house!

290
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:02,508
Ehh. Rich people.

291
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,443
They'd probably make us
drink cider and bob for apples.

292
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,379
- My accountant suggested penny stocks.
- Yeah.

293
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,290
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

294
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:19,458
-Jackpot!
- Ahh.

295
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:21,065
Whoa!

296
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:25,388
Max Dennison.

297
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:26,724
Allison!

298
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:30,290
Ohh. Allison, hmm?

299
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,132
I thought you weren't
into Halloween.

300
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:36,573
I'm not. I'm, I'm just taking
my little sister Dani around.

301
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:38,440
That's nice.

302
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,913
- I always do it.
- My parents made him.

303
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:44,248
Do you guys want some cider?

304
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:46,083
- No.
- Sure.

305
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:53,087
- Ah, yes.
- Oh, I had my eye on that.

306
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,467
Thanks.

307
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,909
So, um, how's the party?

308
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:08,140
Boring. It'sjust a bunch of my parents'
friends. They do this every year.

309
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,784
I've got candy duty.

310
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,190
- By the way, Dani, I love your costume.
- Thank you.

311
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:19,150
I really like yours too.

312
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:22,951
Of course, I couldn't wear anything
like that because I don't have any--

313
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,620
What do you call 'em, Max?
Yabos?

314
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:29,960
Max likes your yabos.

315
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,629
In fact, he loves 'em.

316
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:38,940
- I'm really into witches.
- Really? Me too.

317
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:41,345
We just learned about
those sisters in school.

318
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:43,474
Oh, you mean
the Sanderson Sisters?

319
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,952
I know all about them.
My mom used to run the museum.

320
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:48,115
There's a museum about 'em?

321
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:53,129
Yeah, but they shut it down because, um,
a lot of spooky things happened there.

322
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:56,166
Well, wh-why don't we go to
this old Sanderson house?

323
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:01,171
Well, come on,
make a believer out of me.

324
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:05,678
Okay, let me get changed.
They'll never miss me.

325
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:13,589
Max, I'm not going up there.

326
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:17,515
My friends at school told me all
about that place. It's weird!

327
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,020
Dani, this is the girl
of my dreams.

328
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:23,525
- So? Take her to the movies
like a normal person.
- Dani!

329
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,358
Look,just--just do
this one thing for me,

330
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,366
and I'll do anything you say.

331
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:32,562
Please?

332
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,367
- Please? Please?
- Oh-- Okay. Okay.

333
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:39,276
Next year we go trick-or-treating
as Wendy and Peter Pan.

334
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,279
With tights, or it's no deal.

335
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:46,254
Okay, okay. Deal. Deal. Fine.

336
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:54,127
Legend has it that the bones
of a hundred children were
buried within these walls.

337
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,131
Oh, great.

338
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,571
Ecch.

339
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:27,429
- I can't see a thing.
- Ooh.

340
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:33,003
Well, there's a light switch
around here somewhere.

341
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,791
Found a lighter.

342
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:58,936
Whoa!

343
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:07,201
Here's the original cauldron.

344
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,808
And upstairs
is where they slept.

345
00:28:15,082 --> 00:28:18,645
Oh, and be careful where you
step. The foors are old.

346
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,658
''This is the spell book
of Winifred Sanderson.

347
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:29,063
It was given to her
by the devil himself.

348
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:31,066
The book is bound
in human skin...

349
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:35,641
and contains the recipes for her
most powerful and evil spells.''

350
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,642
I get the picture.

351
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:41,741
What's that?

352
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,751
Oh. It's the black fame candle.

353
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:57,163
Hmm. Black fame candle.

354
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,737
'' Made from the fat of a hangman.

355
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:03,026
Legend says that on a full moon it
will raise the spirits of the dead...

356
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:05,533
when lit by a virgin
on Halloween night.''

357
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,108
Hmm.

358
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:14,874
So let's light the sucker
and meet the old broads.

359
00:29:14,982 --> 00:29:17,883
- Will you do the honors?
- No, thanks.

360
00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:18,884
Well--

361
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:28,228
- Stupid cat!
- Okay, Max, you've had your fun.

362
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,064
It's time to go.
Come on, Allison.

363
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,731
Max, she's right. Let's go.

364
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,072
Oh, come on. It's just
a bunch of hocus pocus.

365
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:41,138
Max, I'm not kidding this time.
It's time to go!

366
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,148
Max, no!

367
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:48,490
Uh-oh.

368
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:29,861
What happened?

369
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,799
A virgin... lit the candle.

370
00:30:53,922 --> 00:30:56,152
We are home!

371
00:30:56,258 --> 00:30:58,319
Oh, sweet revenge!

372
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:01,865
Do you see, sisters?
My curse worked perfectly!

373
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,694
That's because thou art perfect.

374
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:13,843
I knew I left this cauldron on.
Didn't I tell you? Oh, I knew it.

375
00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:18,351
My lucky rat tail!
just where I left it!

376
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:25,492
But who lit
the black fame candle? Hmm.

377
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:33,701
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyhead.

378
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:37,265
Oh, I've missed you.
Did you miss me too?

379
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,739
Come on, now,
we've got work to do.

380
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,350
- Winnie.
- Yes?

381
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:45,045
I smell children.

382
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,389
Sic 'em!

383
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:52,882
- It's a little girl.
- Mmm!

384
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:55,787
Seven. Maybe eight.
And a half.

385
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:58,190
Ooh, let us play with her!

386
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:01,528
Come, little children

387
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:05,261
I'll take thee away

388
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:10,707
- In--
- Come out, my dear.
We will not harm thee.

389
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,074
We love children!

390
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,245
I thought thou would
never come, sisters.

391
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,319
Greetings, little one.

392
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:22,322
- 'Twas I who brought you back.
- Imagine.

393
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:27,321
Such a pretty little...

394
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:29,126
child.

395
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:32,635
Look at her. And she's
so well fed, isn't she?

396
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:35,501
Plump. Plump!

397
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:36,973
Shis-ka-baby.

398
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:42,647
Tell me, dumpling,
what is the year?

399
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:44,970
1 993.

400
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:49,811
Sisters, we have been gone
3OO years.

401
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,442
Well, Winnie,
how time fies, huh?

402
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,452
When you're dead!

403
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:07,829
It's been great fun, but I--
I guess I'd better be going.

404
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:09,839
Oh, stay for supper.

405
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:13,937
I'm-- I'm-- I'm not hungry.

406
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:16,313
Oh, but we are.

407
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,654
- Soup!
- Hey!

408
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:24,319
- Let go of my little sister.
- Roast him, Winnie.

409
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:27,158
No, let me.
Let me play with him.

410
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,239
You. There.

411
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:45,742
I haven't lost my touch,
sisters. See?

412
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,575
- Winnie, Winnie--
- Max!

413
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,181
- Hello. Good-bye.
- Hello, hello.

414
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,590
Max!

415
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:01,432
- Mary!
- Well, hello--

416
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:05,904
- Oh, my, my, my, my, my.
- Don't!

417
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,734
Okay!

418
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:13,107
- You leave my brother alone!
- Ohh!

419
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:16,276
- Max!
- I'll get you!

420
00:34:18,554 --> 00:34:22,547
- Get him! Get this ani--
Get this beast off me!
- Max, come on. Let's go!

421
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:26,963
Get out! Go, go, go!

422
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:30,765
Get it off. Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha!

423
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,033
- Hey!
- Hmm?

424
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,070
You've messed with the
great and powerful Max...

425
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,404
and now must suffer
the consequences.

426
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,910
I summon the burning rain
of death.

427
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:48,606
- Burning what?
- Burning rain of death.
- Burning rain of death.

428
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:52,410
He makes fire in his hand.

429
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:58,619
Ohh! Ohh! The burning
rain of death! Ohh! Ohh!

430
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:01,094
Come on, you idiots!
Get under shelter!

431
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:03,599
Come on, you fools!

432
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,767
Nice going, Max!

433
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:13,108
- It's all your fault!
- You can talk.

434
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:17,481
- Yeah, no kidding.
Now, get the spell book.
- You idiots!

435
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:20,452
Come on, move it!

436
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:23,287
N-N-No, it's not!
It's the burning rain of death!

437
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:29,663
Sic 'em! Aah! My book!

438
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:36,325
Don't! He's going for my book!
Ohhh!

439
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,458
- My book!
- He's got the book!
- The book!

440
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,466
Max! Max, over here!

441
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,542
- Come on! Come on!
- This way!

442
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:48,339
Ohh! Confound it!

443
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:52,983
- Winnie!
- We are dead!
- Shut up!

444
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:55,887
- It is but water!
- Huh?

445
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:57,721
- Most refreshing.
- Ahh. It is.

446
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:00,455
- You idiot!
- Ahhh!
- The boy has tricked us!

447
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:03,033
- And he's stolen the book!
- Ahhh!
- After him!
- Ohh!

448
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:16,542
- 'Tis a b-black river.
- Perhaps it is not too deep.

449
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,255
- 'Tis firm!
- Careful, Winnie.
- Hmm. Mmm.

450
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:28,013
- 'Tis firm as stone.
- Why-- Why, it's a road!

451
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:29,715
- Firm asstone
- Sisters!
- Firm asstone

452
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:31,723
My book!

453
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:51,944
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on! This is a graveyard!

454
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:56,253
It's hallowed ground.
Witches can't set foot here.

455
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:58,224
- He talks.
- Oh.

456
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:01,899
Follow me!

457
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:12,301
Over here.
I want to show you something.

458
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:15,313
Give you an idea of exactly
what we're dealing with.

459
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:25,251
''William Butcherson,
lost soul''?

460
00:37:25,352 --> 00:37:27,583
Billy Butcherson
was Winifred's lover,

461
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:30,124
but she found him sporting
with her sister Sarah,

462
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:33,752
so she poisoned him and sewed
his mouth shut with a dull needle...

463
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:36,663
so he couldn't tell her
secrets even in death.

464
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,565
- Winifred always was the jealous type.
- You're Thackery Binx.

465
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,300
- Yes.
- Huh. So the legends are true.

466
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:45,411
Well, come along. I want
to show you something else.

467
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:53,246
Teenagers again.
I hate Halloween.

468
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,687
Man, this is the worst night of
the year. You wanna give me a hand?

469
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:58,294
- Who-- Who-- Who-- Who are they?
- Boys?

470
00:37:58,395 --> 00:38:00,124
Witch hunters. Observe.

471
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,793
They wear black robes and carry
axes to chop the wood to burn us.

472
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:06,962
- Hold me.
- What a pretty spider.

473
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:12,509
Sisters! Let me make
one thing perfectly clear.

474
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:15,672
The magic
that brought us back...

475
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:18,640
only works tonight,
on All Hallows Eve.

476
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:22,010
When the sun comes up,
we are dust.

477
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,376
- Dust?
- Toast!

478
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,280
Toast?

479
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,650
- Pudding!
- Aaah!

480
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:31,158
Fortunately the potion I brewed
the night we were hanged...

481
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,989
will keep us alive
and young forever.

482
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:37,864
Unfortunately the recipe for
that potion is in my spell book,

483
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,525
and the little wretches
have stolen it!

484
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,005
Therefore, it stands to reason,
does it not, sisters dear,

485
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:45,577
that we must find the book,
brew the potion...

486
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:49,479
and suck the lives out of the children
of Salem before sunrise.

487
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:54,717
Otherwise, it's curtains!
We evaporate! We cease to exist!

488
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:57,383
Dost thou comprehend?

489
00:38:57,527 --> 00:38:59,052
You explained it
beautifully, Winnie.

490
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:01,187
The way you sort of started out
with the adventure part...

491
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,425
- and then you sort of slowly--
- Explained what?

492
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:08,040
- Come! We fly!
- Fly!

493
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:11,441
Because of me my little
sister's life was stolen.

494
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:16,098
For years I waited for my life to end
so I could be reunited with my family.

495
00:39:16,242 --> 00:39:20,543
But Winifred's curse
of immortality kept me alive.

496
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:23,377
Then one day I figured out
what to do with my eternal life.

497
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:27,251
Now, I'd failed Emily,
but I wouldn't fail again.

498
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:31,690
When Winifred and her sisters returned,
I'd be there to stop them.

499
00:39:31,795 --> 00:39:35,629
So for three centuries I've guarded
the house on All Hallows Night,

500
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:38,895
when I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle.

501
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:42,565
- Nice going, airhead.
- Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

502
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:47,914
We're talking about three ancient hags
versus the 2Oth century.

503
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:51,281
- How bad can it be?
- Bad.

504
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:53,820
- Stay out of there!
- Why?

505
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:57,414
It holds Winifred's most dangerous
spells. She must not get it.

506
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:59,427
Well, let's torch the sucker.

507
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,640
It's protected by magic.

508
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:20,601
It's just a bunch
of hocus pocus!

509
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,614
- Sarah!
- Mmm?

510
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:24,979
Mary.

511
00:40:25,117 --> 00:40:28,850
- Max!
- Brave little virgin
who lit the candle.

512
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,324
- I'll be thy friend.
- Hey, take a hike!

513
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:34,293
Ooh! Ouch!

514
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:39,799
- Book!
- Huh?

515
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,533
- Come to Mommy!
- 'Fraid not!

516
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,804
Thackery Binx,
thou mangy feline!

517
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:48,143
- Still alive?
- And waiting for you!

518
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:50,650
Ohh! Thou hast waited
in vain!

519
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:52,845
And thou will fail
to save thy friends,

520
00:40:52,988 --> 00:40:55,355
just as thou failed
to save thy sister!

521
00:40:57,026 --> 00:40:58,995
Grab the book!

522
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,539
- They can't touch us here, right?
- Well, they can't.

523
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,738
I don't like the way
you said that.

524
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:22,370
Unfaithful lover
long since dead,

525
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,814
deep asleep in thy wormy bed,

526
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:27,684
wiggle thy toes,
open thine eyes,

527
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,850
twist thy fingers
toward the sky.

528
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,520
Life is sweet.
Be not too shy.

529
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:37,566
On thy feet, so sayeth I!

530
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,245
Max! Max!

531
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:02,587
Huh?

532
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:16,064
Hi. Hello, Billy.

533
00:42:17,343 --> 00:42:19,938
Catch those children!
Get up!

534
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,243
Get up! Get out of that ditch!
Faster!

535
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:34,661
In here!

536
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:48,011
Yes!

537
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,582
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:05,593
- What is this place, Binx?
- It's the old Salem crypt.
- Here, take the book.

539
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:10,464
- It connects to the sewer
and up to the street.
- Oh. Uh, charming.

540
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:16,133
- Uh, don't look up, Dani.
- Don't worry. I won't.

541
00:43:16,242 --> 00:43:19,371
Relax. I've hunted mice
down here for years.

542
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,813
- Mice?
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God. Just great.

543
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,154
Oh, cheese and crust!
He's lost his head!

544
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:31,226
Ha! Damn that Thackery Binx!
Damn him!

545
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,524
Billy, which way did they go?
Aaah!

546
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:36,690
Billy, listen to me.

547
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:40,702
Follow those children,
you maggot museum, and get my book!

548
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:44,832
Then come find us!
We'll be ready for them!

549
00:43:44,943 --> 00:43:48,381
Quit staring at me!
Get moving down that hole!

550
00:43:48,515 --> 00:43:50,346
- Damn, damn, double damn!
- Oh!

551
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:52,181
Broom, ho!

552
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:55,878
This way!

553
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,191
- Broom, ho.
- Ahh.

554
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:07,324
They're here.
I know they're here.

555
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:10,194
- I know they're here,
but where are they?
- Winnie, look.

556
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,033
- Sniff them out, Mary.
- Uh, they're, they're, uh--

557
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:16,107
- Oh, I can't. They've gone too far.
- Aah!

558
00:44:16,241 --> 00:44:18,540
- I've lost them!
- Aaah!
- Aah!

559
00:44:18,644 --> 00:44:22,706
I'll have your guts for garters, girl!
Confound you!

560
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:25,685
Very well.
We must outwit them.

561
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,880
- When Billy the butcher
gets here with my book,
- Book!

562
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:29,456
- we shall be ready for them!
- Ready!

563
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:31,584
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

564
00:44:31,728 --> 00:44:34,594
- Let us start collecting children.
- Why?

565
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:39,235
Because, you great buffoon,
we want to live forever,

566
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:40,964
not just until tomorrow.

567
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:44,133
The more children's lives we snatch,
the longer we shall live!

568
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:47,475
- Right! Let us fy!
- Fly!
- Wait!

569
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:51,269
Sisters. I have an idea.

570
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:55,745
Since this promises to be a most
dire and stressful evening,

571
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:58,580
I suggest we form
a calming circle.

572
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:01,450
- I am calm!
- Oh, sister.

573
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:06,618
Thou art not being honest
with thyself, are we? Huh? Huh?

574
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:09,130
Come on. Come on.
Give me a smile.

575
00:45:20,346 --> 00:45:22,474
Come along. Not much further.

576
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:25,848
Let's see. Which way, which way.
I can't remember. Oh! Look, down here!

577
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:28,180
Think soothing thoughts.

578
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:29,449
- Rabid bats.
- Yum!

579
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:33,119
Black death.
Mummy's scorpion pie.

580
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:35,129
- Mother.
- Mother.
- Mother.

581
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:46,301
Bubble, bubble, I'm in trouble.

582
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:48,838
Tell me, friend,
what is this contraption?

583
00:45:48,973 --> 00:45:51,840
I call it... a bus.

584
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:54,037
- A bus.
- A bus?

585
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,513
- And its purpose?
- To convey gorgeous creatures
such as yourselves...

586
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,143
to your most forbidden desires.

587
00:46:02,823 --> 00:46:04,816
Well, fancy,

588
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:06,827
we desire...

589
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:09,656
children.

590
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:12,827
Hey, that may take me a couple of tries,
but I don't think that'd be a problem.

591
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,996
- Oh.
- Hop on up.
- Marvellous!

592
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,506
Thank you.

593
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:20,202
Thank you.

594
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:22,543
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

595
00:46:22,683 --> 00:46:27,883
I need one of those instant ice packs.
You girls are giving me a fever! Yeow!

596
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:33,528
- Go, Binx!
- Come here, you guys! This way!

597
00:46:41,463 --> 00:46:44,059
Hurry! Come on!

598
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,066
Up the ladder!

599
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,709
- Come on!
- Careful.

600
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:55,873
Hey, buttercup, anybody ever tell you
you're very easy on the eyes?

601
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,524
Binx! Look out!

602
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:06,060
Whoa! Speed bump!

603
00:47:07,597 --> 00:47:11,261
- Binx! Ohh!
- Speed bump!

604
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:16,404
Oh, my God.

605
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:19,444
- No.
- It's all my fault.

606
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:24,276
- Max, it's not your fault.
- Ohh.

607
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:31,592
- Look!
- Max!

608
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,213
I hate it when that happens.

609
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:37,950
Well.

610
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:41,585
I told you, I can't die.
Dani, you all right?

611
00:47:41,697 --> 00:47:43,597
- Yeah!
- Okay, then, let's go!

612
00:47:45,102 --> 00:47:47,798
Stop!

613
00:47:50,474 --> 00:47:53,774
- I smell children.
- Marvelous.

614
00:47:53,878 --> 00:47:56,780
Hey, hey, cupcake, don't I get
your phone number? Your area code?

615
00:47:56,882 --> 00:48:00,479
- You want my route schedule?
- Oh, thou wouldst hate me
in the morning.

616
00:48:00,621 --> 00:48:03,455
- No, I wouldn’t.
- Oh, believe me, thou wouldst.

617
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:05,857
Party pooper.

618
00:48:06,863 --> 00:48:09,297
What is this, sisters?

619
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:11,334
Odds bodkins.

620
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:14,996
Farewell, mortal bus boy.

621
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,201
- Oh, my.
- What are those? What's that?

622
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:19,834
- Um--
- What is that?
- Uh, hobgoblins.
- Oh.

623
00:48:19,979 --> 00:48:21,947
Ohh! Oh.

624
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:23,347
Bless you.

625
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:31,018
- Enough!
- Uh, sisters, I'm very confused.

626
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:34,713
I-- I smell children,
but I-- I don't see children.

627
00:48:34,856 --> 00:48:37,791
I-- I've lost my power!

628
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:40,555
- Enough, enough, enough!
- Sorry.

629
00:48:40,696 --> 00:48:42,324
- We are witches. We are evil!
- Evil.

630
00:48:42,432 --> 00:48:45,526
What would Mother say
if she could see us like this?

631
00:48:45,668 --> 00:48:47,364
Oh.

632
00:48:47,505 --> 00:48:49,370
- Mother.
- Mother.

633
00:48:52,744 --> 00:48:55,213
- Master!
- Master!
- Master! Ohh!

634
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:57,214
- Oh, my!
- He will help us!

635
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,379
- What kind of costumes are these?
- Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

636
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:03,684
It's the Sanderson Sisters,
right?

637
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:06,887
-At your service.
-Yes, yes.
-Haven't seen you for centuries.

638
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:12,230
But what the heck? Why don't you come
in? Come in to the non-smoking section.

639
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:16,101
- Come on, come on, right this way.
- Oh, I can't believe it's him!

640
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,175
Don't step on my tail!

641
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:25,743
- Officer! Officer!
- Officer, we need your help.

642
00:49:25,887 --> 00:49:27,902
What's the problem?

643
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:30,277
- Tell him.
- Go ahead.

644
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,749
Well, um--

645
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,583
Well, you see, for--
I just, I just moved here.

646
00:49:37,325 --> 00:49:41,523
W-Well, you see, i-it's like this.
I-- I, um--

647
00:49:41,629 --> 00:49:45,259
I broke into the old Sanderson
house and I brought the witches
back from the dead.

648
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:47,563
See, I even have the book.

649
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:52,903
- You lit the black fame candle?
- Yeah.

650
00:49:57,117 --> 00:50:00,450
Come on. Okay, let's
get on the sidewalk.

651
00:50:03,192 --> 00:50:05,251
And he's a virgin.

652
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:14,437
Come here.

653
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:20,773
- Are you a virgin?
- Yeah.

654
00:50:20,882 --> 00:50:22,772
Really.

655
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:24,968
Look, I'll get it tattooed
on my forehead, okay?

656
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,238
- Officer, this is not a prank.
- Really!

657
00:50:27,347 --> 00:50:31,944
Hey! I put my life on the line
to protect this community,
and you punks pull this?

658
00:50:32,052 --> 00:50:33,611
- Get outta here.
- Come on, Dani.

659
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:35,623
And take that cat with ya.

660
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:44,665
- What's so funny, Eddie?
- Ahh,just a bunch of kids
pullin' my chain.

661
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:49,837
They thought I was a real cop.

662
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:10,865
I want you to meet
the little woman.

663
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:16,631
- He has a little woman.
- Sounds tasty.

664
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,393
- Today--
-Swimmingpool, swimmingpool--

665
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,901
- Petunia face.
- What?

666
00:51:21,038 --> 00:51:24,406
Would you stop clicking?
We have company!

667
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:26,807
- I don't care who's here.
I'm sick and tired...
- Sisters.

668
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:30,349
- of these dressing-up games.
- Satan has married Medusa.
See the snakes in her hair?

669
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,214
- I don't wanna play in this.
I don't wanna play.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

670
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:38,522
My three favorite witches.

671
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:41,390
Aren’t you broads a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

672
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:45,194
- We'll be younger in the morning.
- Yes.

673
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:49,239
- Yeah, sure. Me too.
- I went out with him Valentine's Day.

674
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:50,898
Excuse me.

675
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:58,075
Wow! Neat brooms!

676
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:03,789
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

677
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:06,053
Forget the kids.
I'm serving you from my cauldron.

678
00:52:06,161 --> 00:52:08,392
- Winnie!
- Yes?
- For you.

679
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:11,593
Master, I plague thee.
What about the book?

680
00:52:11,736 --> 00:52:15,094
We'll get to the book later.
Mary, go long!

681
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,932
Yeah! You could be
a tight end!

682
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:24,099
Master, would thou
dance with me?

683
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:29,271
Behold!

684
00:52:29,415 --> 00:52:31,280
A torture chamber.

685
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:45,094
Honey, I lost five pounds
according to the bathroom--

686
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:47,465
- Now there's a Stain master carpet...
- Master.

687
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:50,096
that handles foot traffic
like never before.

688
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:56,240
Okay, that's it. Party's over!

689
00:52:56,348 --> 00:53:01,253
Get out of my house!
Get outta here! Get outta my house!

690
00:53:01,355 --> 00:53:04,325
- Sorry.
- Calm down, puddin' face.

691
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:06,519
- Shove it, Satan.
- Ohh.

692
00:53:06,662 --> 00:53:10,145
- Thou should not speak to
Master in such a manner.
- Mm-mmm.

693
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,988
- They call me Master.
- Wait'll you see what
I'm gonna call ya.

694
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:18,260
Now, tart face, take your Clark bars
and get out of my house!

695
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:22,339
Make us!

696
00:53:22,474 --> 00:53:25,670
- Yeah!
- Honey bunch.

697
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:28,679
Ralph! Sic 'em!

698
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:38,183
Winnie! Winnie!

699
00:53:38,327 --> 00:53:40,693
- My broom!
- My broom!
- My broom!

700
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:44,494
Purloined! Curses!

701
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:48,470
Sisters, look. 'Tis the
chocolate-covered finger
of a man named Clark.

702
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:51,202
Mmm. Ooh! Ugh!

703
00:53:51,342 --> 00:53:53,868
It's candy. Why would
the master give us candy?

704
00:53:54,012 --> 00:53:55,810
- Because he is not our master.
- He isn't?

705
00:53:55,915 --> 00:53:57,815
- And these are not hobgoblins.
- Ohh!

706
00:53:57,917 --> 00:53:59,579
- See?
- Ohh!
- Cool it, man!

707
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,521
A child! Ohh!

708
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:07,576
- Weirdos!
- Weirdos!
- Sisters!
- Mmm.

709
00:54:07,721 --> 00:54:10,747
- All Hallows Eve has become
a night of frolic...
- Oh.

710
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:13,657
- where children wear costumes
and run amok!
- Oh!

711
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:17,495
Amok! Amok, amok,
amok, amok, amok--

712
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:20,934
- Oh, Winnie, just one child.
- No!

713
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:24,668
Ah, great. How are we ever gonna
find Mom and Dad in this place?

714
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:28,774
Hi, hi, hi. Hi.

715
00:54:34,455 --> 00:54:37,357
Owww! Whoo!

716
00:54:40,062 --> 00:54:42,963
Those fingers through my hair

717
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:46,263
Thatsly ''come hit her''stare

718
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:48,529
That strips my conscience bare

719
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:50,699
It's witchcraft

720
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:52,743
- I'm gonna look for Mom.
- Baby!

721
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:55,940
-And I got no defense for it
- I can't see a thing!

722
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:59,074
- Whoo! Waah! Whoo!
- The heat is too intense for it

723
00:54:59,186 --> 00:55:03,877
What good would
common sense for it do

724
00:55:03,982 --> 00:55:05,882
- Aaah!
- It's witchcraft

725
00:55:05,984 --> 00:55:10,480
- Oh. Dad!
- It's not Dad. It's '' Dadcula.''

726
00:55:10,624 --> 00:55:15,324
Oh, my goodness. Who must this
charming young blood donor be?

727
00:55:15,463 --> 00:55:18,160
Dad! Something terrible
happened.

728
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:21,328
- Dani? What's wrong? Wh-Wh--
- No, Dani's fine.

729
00:55:21,471 --> 00:55:23,770
Good. Excuse me. Come here.

730
00:55:27,813 --> 00:55:29,679
Mom?

731
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,183
- Mom?
- Hmm?

732
00:55:37,326 --> 00:55:39,922
What are you supposed to be?

733
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,464
Madonna.

734
00:55:42,566 --> 00:55:46,936
Well, you know--
Well, obviously. Don't ya think?

735
00:55:47,038 --> 00:55:51,441
Shoot, Max. Look,
whatever it is, just tell me.

736
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:53,444
- Come here.
- What?

737
00:55:53,546 --> 00:55:55,844
This cat here, Binx, right?
He can talk.

738
00:55:55,982 --> 00:55:58,100
My brother's a virgin:
he lit the black fame candle.

739
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:01,042
The witches are back from the dead
and they're after us. We need help.

740
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:03,171
How much candy
have you had, honey?

741
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:05,784
Mom, I haven't O.D.'d.
I haven't even had a piece.

742
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:10,221
They're real witches, they can
fy, and they're gonna eat all
the kids in Salem. They're real!

743
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:14,227
All right, let's just
find your father.

744
00:56:14,363 --> 00:56:17,299
It's such an ancient pitch

745
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,564
But one I wouldn't switch

746
00:56:20,704 --> 00:56:23,799
- 'Cause there's non icer witch
- Slither about.

747
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:26,207
- Find them!
- Oh, no, I'll never switch

748
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:29,472
- Ohh! Aah!
- 'Cause there's non icer witch

749
00:56:29,582 --> 00:56:32,484
Than you

750
00:56:32,586 --> 00:56:35,146
I put a spell on you

751
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:38,885
And now you're mine

752
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:41,087
- Max, I love you, but enough is enough.
- Come on, Dad, if I was
gonna pull your chain--

753
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,062
- Now, just calm down.
- But they're gonna come--

754
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,667
- Don't you see how crazy this sounds?
- Max! Max!

755
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,604
- Max, really--
- They're here! They're here!
- I ain't gonna take none
of your runnin' 'round

756
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,073
- I ain't gonna take none
of your puttin'me down
- Did you find them?
- Sorry.

757
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,068
- Get out there and find them.
- Nobody's here, sweetheart.

758
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:58,231
- Here. Hold this.
- Sweetheart, nobody's here.
- Wait. Max. Max!
- Where are you going?

759
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,936
- i put a spell on you
- Sarah!

760
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,072
-And now you're mine
- Bye.

761
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:07,743
- Get over here! Did you find them?
- Find who?

762
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:10,516
I ain't lyin'
No, I ain't lyin'

763
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:13,184
- Hey, cut the music! Cut the music!
- Hey, man, I'm in the middle of a song!

764
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:16,128
It's an emergency!
Only for a minute!

765
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:19,063
Will everybody listen up,
please?

766
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:20,933
- No. You’re just getting
everybody worked up.
- Well, listen to him.
Listen to him. He's fine!

767
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:23,768
- Your kids are in danger.
- What do you mean?

768
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:27,437
3OO years ago the Sanderson
Sisters bewitched people.

769
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,549
Now they've returned
from their grave.

770
00:57:30,651 --> 00:57:32,779
Hey, man, I'm serious!
It's not a joke!

771
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:34,444
- All right, this has gone far enough.
- No, wait a minute.

772
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:36,614
I know this sounds dumb,

773
00:57:36,758 --> 00:57:38,624
but they're here tonight.

774
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:40,922
They're right over there!

775
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,903
- Aah!
- Ohh.
- Wow.
- Thank you, Max,

776
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:52,127
for that marvelous introduction.

777
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,897
i put a spell on you

778
00:57:58,009 --> 00:58:00,410
And now you're mine

779
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:06,346
You can't stop
the things I do

780
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:09,980
- I ain't lyin'
- No! No!

781
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,524
- Ohh
- Don't listen to them!

782
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:13,456
Been3OOyears

783
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:15,792
Right down to the day

784
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:18,093
Now the witch is back

785
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,830
And there's hell to pay

786
00:58:21,972 --> 00:58:25,841
i put a spell on you

787
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:28,447
- Good joke. Happy Halloween.
Thanks a lot.
- No, man, I'm serious!

788
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:31,517
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
You had, you had your fun.
- You gotta believe me! I'm not kidding!

789
00:58:31,651 --> 00:58:33,846
And now you're mine

790
00:58:33,987 --> 00:58:36,513
All right. Yeah, gear up.
Let's go, guys.

791
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,692
Hello, Salem!

792
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:43,984
My name's Winifred!
What's yours?

793
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:46,525
i put a spell on you

794
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,359
-And now you're gone
- Gone, gone, gone, so long

795
00:58:50,499 --> 00:58:53,194
My whammy fell on you

796
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:56,863
-And it was strong
-So strong, so strong, so strong

797
00:58:57,007 --> 00:58:59,909
Your wretched little lives
have all been cursed

798
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:03,207
'Cause of all the witches
working I'm the worst

799
00:59:03,347 --> 00:59:05,680
i put a spell on you

800
00:59:05,785 --> 00:59:09,084
-And now you're mine
- Binx, where are you?

801
00:59:10,724 --> 00:59:13,159
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out

802
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:19,931
If you don't believe
you'd better get superstitious

803
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,904
-Ask my sisters
- Mom! Dad! Thank God!
- Hey, Max, great show.

804
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:25,839
- Cover your ears!
- Cover our ears!
- i put a spell on you

805
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:29,907
What? Ho-ho! Uh-oh!

806
00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:34,283
- i put a spell on you
- Oh, I wish we had a camera.

807
00:59:34,422 --> 00:59:37,517
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

808
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:40,609
Ah-say-into-pie
Oppa-maybe-uppen-die

809
00:59:40,753 --> 00:59:43,781
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma
- In-kama-koray-ah-ma

810
00:59:43,925 --> 00:59:45,358
- Hey
- Hey!
- High
- High!

811
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,859
-Say
- Say!
- Bye
- Bye!

812
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:50,957
Bye

813
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:52,796
Bye-bye

814
00:59:59,176 --> 01:00:03,080
Dance! Dance!
Dance until you die!

815
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,657
Oh, Binx, come on!

816
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:24,935
- This is really bad!
- Max, come on! Calm down!

817
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,013
Look, I want you to take Dani
back to your house and don't
let her out of your sight!

818
01:00:28,147 --> 01:00:30,411
Max, I'm not leaving you.

819
01:00:32,451 --> 01:00:34,819
Okay, guys, who's goin'
for the jacuzzi?

820
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:38,909
Yeah, Angelo, too bad.

821
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:45,817
- Uh-oh.
- Get down!

822
01:00:48,664 --> 01:00:50,154
- I smell--
- Yes?

823
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:52,495
- Winnie, I smell--
- Yes? Yes?

824
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:56,003
I smell scrod.

825
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,004
Scrod. You know.
It's a bottom dweller.

826
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:00,337
You cook it sometimes with lovely
bread crumbs, little bit of margarine.

827
01:01:00,477 --> 01:01:02,275
Or oil. Olive oil is good.

828
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:06,283
But you have to cook it at 35O degrees
or else it tastes really-- Aah!

829
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:09,116
Sarah. Sarah!

830
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,970
I have an idea.

831
01:01:28,046 --> 01:01:31,201
- What is this place?
- Mmm, it reeks of children.

832
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:33,742
It is a prison for children.

833
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:45,220
Welcome to High School Hell.

834
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,728
I'm your host,
Boris Karloff Jr.

835
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:54,002
This way. I know I'm right.

836
01:01:54,104 --> 01:01:57,075
It's time to meet
our three contestants:

837
01:01:57,209 --> 01:02:01,508
Sarah, Mary
and Winifred Sanderson.

838
01:02:01,612 --> 01:02:04,013
Read any good spellbooks
lately?

839
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:08,187
Hag tracks!

840
01:02:10,057 --> 01:02:11,922
Get him!

841
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:17,224
Hello. Welcome to the library.

842
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:28,428
I would like a book.

843
01:02:32,476 --> 01:02:34,808
Shh! Shh! Shh!

844
01:02:34,945 --> 01:02:36,914
What kind of book
are you looking for?

845
01:02:39,118 --> 01:02:41,586
We've got them!
We've got them, we've got them!

846
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:47,818
- What? Hello.
- I am looking for a children's book
- Yes?

847
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:59,273
- Wretches!
- It's warm in here.

848
01:02:59,378 --> 01:03:01,277
Fire. Fire!

849
01:03:03,115 --> 01:03:04,481
Aah! It's hot! It's hot!

850
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:14,690
Farewell, Winifred Sanderson!
Ha ha!

851
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,459
- Yes! Yay!
- Burn! Burn! All right!

852
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:20,799
Whoo! Whoo!

853
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:24,524
Yeah! All right!

854
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,968
- Yes!
- Yes!

855
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,205
Yes!

856
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:41,720
We did it, Binx.
We stopped them.

857
01:03:41,856 --> 01:03:47,387
I've wanted to do that for 3OO
years, since they took Emily.

858
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:53,901
You really miss her, don’t you?

859
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:58,236
Man, you can't keep blaming yourself
for that. That happened so long ago.

860
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,470
Take good care of Dani, Max.

861
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:05,072
You'll never know how precious
she is until you lose her.

862
01:04:09,556 --> 01:04:14,358
Hey, Binx! Where do you
think you’re goin'?

863
01:04:14,462 --> 01:04:17,432
You're a Dennison now, buddy.
One of us.

864
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,254
Come on, Binx, let's go home.

865
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:22,692
Home.

866
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,526
Home.

867
01:04:32,142 --> 01:04:35,270
Mom? Dad?

868
01:04:35,412 --> 01:04:38,679
We got a new cat! Mom?

869
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:43,288
Well, I guess they're
still partying. Come on in.

870
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:55,465
You're my kitty now.

871
01:04:55,606 --> 01:04:59,907
You'll have milk and tuna fish every
day, and you'll only hunt mice for fun.

872
01:05:00,011 --> 01:05:04,471
You're going to turn me into
one of those fat, useless,
contented house cats.

873
01:05:04,617 --> 01:05:06,482
You betcha.

874
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:13,910
- Yeah.
- You know, Binx,
I'll always take care of you.

875
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:16,545
My children will
take care of you too.

876
01:05:16,656 --> 01:05:21,994
And then their children after
that, and theirs after that,

877
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:26,328
forever and ever...

878
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:28,835
and ever.

879
01:05:53,503 --> 01:05:58,133
Hello. I want my book.

880
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:08,285
- You wanna smash some pumpkins?
- Nah.

881
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:11,543
Well, then you wanna look in
windows and watch babes undress?

882
01:06:11,683 --> 01:06:14,345
It's 3:OO.
They're undressed already.

883
01:06:17,991 --> 01:06:21,392
- Well, then you think of something!
- I don't feel so good.

884
01:06:21,528 --> 01:06:24,726
- It's 'cause you're eatin'
too much candy, ya oinker!
- Seek them out, Mary.

885
01:06:24,866 --> 01:06:27,198
- Seek them out.
- Okay, Winnie.

886
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:35,908
- Yes!
- Yo, witch. Get your face off my shoe.

887
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:39,416
- Uhh, wrong boy.
- Natch!
- Ohh, sorry, Winnie.

888
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:43,649
Why, why, why was I cursed
with such idiot sisters?

889
01:06:45,393 --> 01:06:48,191
-Just lucky, I guess.
- Ohh!

890
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:53,030
Oh, man, how come it's always
the ugly chicks that stay out late?

891
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,108
Chicks?

892
01:06:58,242 --> 01:07:02,544
We haven't much time left!
We shall have to-- We shall have
to make the potion from memory!

893
01:07:02,649 --> 01:07:04,834
Hey! Let us outta here!

894
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:08,434
- Yeah, we're really sorry.
- We think you’re really cute.

895
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,342
- Hush!
- Aaah!

896
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:13,111
- I've got to think.
- Ohh.

897
01:07:13,252 --> 01:07:16,085
- Please!
- Remember. Remember.

898
01:07:16,222 --> 01:07:18,214
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.

899
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:21,260
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Remember, Winnie, remember.
- Now I remember!

900
01:07:21,395 --> 01:07:23,296
- I was here.
- Yes.
- The book was there.
- Uh--

901
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:27,129
You, Mary, you were here. Sarah, you
were in the back, dancing idiotically.

902
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:29,534
- And the book said--
- Yes?
- I remember it like it was yesterday.

903
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,578
- Yes?
- Oil of boil...
- Mmm?
- and a dead man's nose.

904
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:36,909
- Dead man's toes!
- She's trying to concentrate!

905
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,745
- No.
- Go! Go, go, go!

906
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:41,252
- His thumbs.
- Thumbs? Could be thumbs.
- Or was it his gums?

907
01:07:41,354 --> 01:07:43,914
- I don't know. Thumbs, gums.
- Or dead man's buns.
- Dead man's buns. Buns.

908
01:07:44,024 --> 01:07:45,493
- Sounds like--
- Mums?
- Mums.

909
01:07:45,627 --> 01:07:47,491
- Funs.
- Funs.
- Chungs?
- Chungs? Mmm!

910
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:50,929
- It's chungs!
- Chungs?
- Dead man's chungs!

911
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,628
There is no such thing
as chungs.

912
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,328
- You're right.
- I am? I'm right?

913
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,499
It's no use. I don't
remember the ingredients.

914
01:07:58,643 --> 01:08:02,434
I-- I-- I've got to
have my book!

915
01:08:06,376 --> 01:08:10,609
- Leave him alone!
- Aaah! I'm gonna puke!

916
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:14,812
Book!

917
01:08:14,952 --> 01:08:18,822
Come home
or make thyself known!

918
01:08:35,414 --> 01:08:37,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

919
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,155
Oh, my God. It's 5:OO.

920
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,162
My parents are gonna kill me.

921
01:08:49,264 --> 01:08:53,396
- I should go.
- I wish you could stay.

922
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,297
Poor Binx.

923
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:03,873
Yeah. Poor Binx.

924
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:10,014
- We owe him a lot.
- Yeah.

925
01:09:10,115 --> 01:09:14,018
Look, cou-- could we find
some kind of way to help him?

926
01:09:16,722 --> 01:09:19,215
The book.

927
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,227
The witches used it to put
the spell on him.

928
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:25,231
Maybe there's a way in here
to take it off.

929
01:09:26,802 --> 01:09:30,603
Mmm, I don't know.
Binx told us not to open it.

930
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:33,608
Well, the witches are dead.
What harm could it do?

931
01:09:38,817 --> 01:09:41,514
Well, just be careful.

932
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:44,090
I will.

933
01:09:44,224 --> 01:09:46,853
- Hold my hand.
- All right.

934
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,456
Nothing weird so far.

935
01:09:57,598 --> 01:10:00,625
Winnie, oh, do you wanna hit me?
Would that cheer you up?

936
01:10:00,769 --> 01:10:04,901
- Okay. There you go.
- This is the end.

937
01:10:05,009 --> 01:10:07,306
- No.
- I feel it.
- Okay.

938
01:10:07,443 --> 01:10:12,382
We are doomed. I feel
the icy breath of death upon my neck.

939
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:16,280
- Mary?
- What?
- Take me to the window.

940
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:17,912
- This one?
- I wish to say good-bye.

941
01:10:18,024 --> 01:10:19,491
Yes, Winnie.

942
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,992
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

943
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:23,654
- Good-bye, cruel world.
- Bye-bye, cruel world.

944
01:10:23,798 --> 01:10:25,892
- Good-bye to life.
- Bye-bye, life.

945
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:28,664
- Good-bye, good-bye.
- Good-bye-bye.

946
01:10:28,805 --> 01:10:30,830
- Good-bye to all that.
- To all that.

947
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,802
- Sister! Observe!
- What?
- They've opened it!

948
01:10:35,947 --> 01:10:38,576
Ha ha! Just when our time
was running out!

949
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:43,521
- Come! We fy!
- We fy! On what do we fy?

950
01:10:53,828 --> 01:10:57,264
Ahh! Into the night! Ahh!

951
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,883
Winnie?

952
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:19,480
Broom, ho!

953
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:21,561
Ohh!

954
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,569
Oh, listen to this.

955
01:11:27,703 --> 01:11:32,073
Only a circle of salt can protect
thy victims from thy power.

956
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,580
- We were just trying to help you.
- Well, don't!

957
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:46,808
Nothing good can come
from this book. You got it?

958
01:11:58,933 --> 01:12:01,335
- Maybe we should go now.
- Okay.

959
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:14,045
Mom? Dad?

960
01:12:18,425 --> 01:12:21,259
Still not home. That's weird.

961
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:24,456
Must be having a great time.

962
01:12:24,599 --> 01:12:27,535
I don't know.
Something's not right.

963
01:12:27,637 --> 01:12:31,300
I'd feel a lot safer walking
home if we had some salt.

964
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:47,809
Salt.

965
01:12:47,953 --> 01:12:49,819
Ahh!

966
01:12:51,459 --> 01:12:53,483
What's it say?

967
01:12:53,626 --> 01:12:57,291
Uh, it says form a circle of
salt to protect from zombies,

968
01:12:57,432 --> 01:12:59,764
witches and old boyfriends.

969
01:12:59,868 --> 01:13:01,769
Yeah? And what about
new boyfriends?

970
01:13:11,684 --> 01:13:13,675
Dani.

971
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:18,090
Dani!

972
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,865
Max, the book is gone.

973
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:32,140
I'm telling you,
something's weird.

974
01:13:34,513 --> 01:13:35,970
- Dani, wake up.
- Trick or treat!

975
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,040
- Looking for this?
- Or this?

976
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,819
Boy down.

977
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:54,622
Salt! Ha!

978
01:13:54,728 --> 01:13:57,892
- What a clever little white witch.
- Yeah!

979
01:13:58,032 --> 01:14:00,797
But it will not save
thy friends. No.

980
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:03,873
Come, sisters. The candle's
magic is almost spent.

981
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:06,568
- Dawn approaches.
- Bye-bye.

982
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,509
Max!

983
01:14:09,614 --> 01:14:13,677
Put me down! Let me go!
Aaah! Put me down!

984
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:22,754
Dani? Dani?

985
01:14:26,635 --> 01:14:29,366
Dani!

986
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:35,761
Max. Max.

987
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,874
- Ohh.
- Get up.
- Ohh.
- Are you okay?

988
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,501
- Ohh.
- Come on, get up.
- Where's Dani?

989
01:14:42,313 --> 01:14:45,943
Use thy voice, Sarah!
Fill the sky!

990
01:14:46,084 --> 01:14:48,951
Bring the little brats to die!

991
01:14:53,894 --> 01:14:57,127
Come, little children

992
01:14:57,266 --> 01:15:01,395
I'll take thee away

993
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:04,440
Into a land

994
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:09,070
Of enchantment

995
01:15:09,181 --> 01:15:12,638
Come, little children

996
01:15:12,783 --> 01:15:16,721
The time's come to play

997
01:15:16,823 --> 01:15:20,316
Here in my garden

998
01:15:20,461 --> 01:15:25,559
Of magic

999
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:32,663
- Dani!
- Dani!

1000
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:42,674
Hey! Hey, you guys!

1001
01:15:42,812 --> 01:15:46,910
Don't listen to her!
Hey! Up here!

1002
01:15:47,019 --> 01:15:50,420
- Don't listen to her!
- Max! Max, I've figured it out.

1003
01:15:50,522 --> 01:15:53,652
- What?
- Winifred said...

1004
01:15:53,794 --> 01:15:56,319
the candle's magic
will soon be spent...

1005
01:15:56,463 --> 01:15:58,797
and dawn approaches.

1006
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:03,031
The black fame candle only brought
them back for this one Halloween night.

1007
01:16:03,172 --> 01:16:06,041
And unless they can steal
the lives of children,

1008
01:16:06,177 --> 01:16:09,669
when the sun comes up
they're dust.

1009
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:12,511
Yeah, but how can we
make the sun come up?

1010
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,849
They've got Dani.

1011
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:18,322
We need a miracle.

1012
01:16:36,037 --> 01:16:38,506
The children are coming.

1013
01:16:38,608 --> 01:16:41,839
- Ohh! Well done, sister Sarah.
- Mmm! Good, good, good, good!

1014
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,514
Let me out of here!

1015
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:53,350
Hurry, okay? Oh, watch out!

1016
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,420
Come on! Get out of the way!
Move it!

1017
01:16:59,935 --> 01:17:03,666
- Aaah! I'm gonna ralph.
- Open up!

1018
01:17:03,772 --> 01:17:06,105
No more candy, please!
Oww! Oww!

1019
01:17:06,242 --> 01:17:09,702
- Soon the lives of all thy
little friends will be mine,
- Oww! Oww!

1020
01:17:09,814 --> 01:17:12,612
and I shall be young
and beautiful again forever.

1021
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:16,883
It doesn't matter how young or old
you are! You sold your soul!

1022
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:21,009
You're the ugliest thing that's
ever lived, and you know it!

1023
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:25,255
You die first.

1024
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:48,080
- No!
- Ahh! 'Tis ready!

1025
01:17:48,186 --> 01:17:50,087
- Pry open her mouth.
- Gladly.

1026
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:52,158
- Dani, don't drink it!
- Shut up, you!

1027
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,227
- Don't drink it, Dani!
- Come on, open your mouth.

1028
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:57,390
- Open up--
- Aah!
- Aah! She bit me!

1029
01:18:01,103 --> 01:18:02,161
She bit me, Winnie!

1030
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:03,939
Prepare to die!

1031
01:18:04,174 --> 01:18:05,972
- Again.
- You!

1032
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:09,170
- You have no powers here, you fool!
- Hollywood!

1033
01:18:09,313 --> 01:18:12,284
- Maybe not!
- Come here!
- But there's a power
greater than your magic,

1034
01:18:12,385 --> 01:18:14,775
- and that's knowledge!
- Hey, come on, man!

1035
01:18:14,877 --> 01:18:18,406
- And there's one thing that
I know that you don't!
- Ohh!

1036
01:18:18,516 --> 01:18:20,416
And what is that, dude?

1037
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,183
Daylight savings time.

1038
01:18:24,324 --> 01:18:26,758
'' Daylight savings time.''

1039
01:18:28,363 --> 01:18:31,422
- Winnie!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

1040
01:18:31,531 --> 01:18:34,023
The sun! No!

1041
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:37,605
- Max! Get me out of here!
- The sun!

1042
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:42,371
It hurts!

1043
01:18:44,882 --> 01:18:47,477
- Don't worry, Binx!
I've got you! I'm here!
- Aah! Hot! Hot cat! Hot cat!

1044
01:18:47,586 --> 01:18:50,215
Hey! Let me outta here!

1045
01:18:51,758 --> 01:18:55,889
Help! Help! Hey! Hollywood!
Help us out here.

1046
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:04,405
- Tubular.
- Aaah! Aaah!

1047
01:19:05,776 --> 01:19:08,405
- Yes!
- Let me outta here, man!

1048
01:19:08,546 --> 01:19:11,300
- Come on, Dani, let's go!
- Let me outta here, man!

1049
01:19:11,406 --> 01:19:14,571
Max! I wanna see her
turn to dust!

1050
01:19:17,882 --> 01:19:19,748
Pump it!

1051
01:19:22,053 --> 01:19:23,918
Allison!

1052
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,265
I am alive!

1053
01:19:39,409 --> 01:19:41,843
Damn that boy.
He's tricked us again.

1054
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:45,007
- Oh, you're right. You're always right.
I don't know how you do it--
- It's my curse!

1055
01:19:45,117 --> 01:19:50,021
- That, and you two. Get off me,
you thundering oafs!
- Ohh! Sorry.

1056
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:54,116
Look! The candle's almost out,
and my potion--

1057
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,457
My beautiful potion.

1058
01:19:56,598 --> 01:20:01,798
Look! There's just
enough left for one child.

1059
01:20:01,938 --> 01:20:03,463
Get the vial.

1060
01:20:05,132 --> 01:20:07,397
Come on! Move it!

1061
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,403
Oh, joy! What luck!

1062
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:12,373
This is perfect for that
little towheaded brat.

1063
01:20:12,476 --> 01:20:15,469
- We have a child.
- Him!
- Him!

1064
01:20:15,613 --> 01:20:20,312
And look, Winnie, more children
are arriving. Come on in.

1065
01:20:20,451 --> 01:20:25,823
Winnie. Winnie, we will make more potion
because, Winnie, we have the book!

1066
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:27,655
We haven't the time!

1067
01:20:27,795 --> 01:20:31,493
Besides, I want to get that little
rat-faced kid that called me--

1068
01:20:31,633 --> 01:20:34,602
- Oh! Oh, don't say it.
Don't even say it.
- Ugly?

1069
01:20:37,472 --> 01:20:40,807
- Oh, honey. I know.
- She really hurt my feelings.

1070
01:20:40,944 --> 01:20:44,243
- She's jealous.
- She doesn't even know me!
- I know. I know. And she said--

1071
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:48,512
- You know, I always wanted a child.

Well, say what you want.

1094
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:41,607
Billy! I killed you once!

1108
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:08,230
You little pest.
