1
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:59,802
BTSFilms - Always a Good Movie!

2
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:58,896
Katie!

3
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:01,065
Cora!

4
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:02,832
You love your sister?

5
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,601
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

6
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,582
Good morning, Estelle.

7
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:57,457
-How am I looking, Paul?
-That's better. That's better.

8
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:15,180
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

9
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:16,810
Some Danish?

10
00:03:17,017 --> 00:03:20,180
No, just two pieces of
dry toast, Hector. Thanks.

11
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:21,786
Leftover's fine.

12
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:24,183
Dry and cold, same as always.

13
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:25,415
Cold is better.

14
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,890
Especially on those long walks.

15
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:31,555
Am I right?

16
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,569
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

17
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,897
We're not supposed to
let you wander off.

18
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:46,074
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

19
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,207
Just walk.

20
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:50,305
I like to walk.

21
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:54,820
Try not to fall down, bust a hip.

22
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,854
I don't wanna be in no
damn search party.

23
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:12,061
You want this man in your life?
Explain the moral basis of that.

24
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,323
I've made mistakes.

25
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,468
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

26
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,730
You can't ask nothing.
I have six kids myself.

27
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,508
Why do we always watch this stuff?

28
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,744
It's interesting.

29
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:31,115
Interesting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

30
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:33,878
All they ever talk about is fucking.

31
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,776
Are you all right?

32
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:01,503
You look tired. You're not yourself.

33
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:04,377
No, I'm fine. I promise.

34
00:06:04,784 --> 00:06:08,481
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

35
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,622
Not that you asked me.

36
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:13,790
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

37
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:18,093
I had a few bad dreams. It happens.

38
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,959
I'll be fine.

39
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:31,102
If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

40
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,437
Neither do I.

41
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:35,271
Now, this here is worth a look.

42
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:39,017
I'm in heaven

43
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,157
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

44
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,560
And I seem to find

45
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:52,459
The happiness I seek

46
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,935
When we're out together

47
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:59,128
Dancing cheek to cheek

48
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,004
Heaven

49
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:05,043
I'm in heaven

50
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:08,573
And the cares that hung around me

51
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:11,580
Through the week

52
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:13,549
Seem to vanish

53
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:16,847
Like a gambler's lucky streak

54
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,160
Paul, what is it?

55
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:26,031
My God.

56
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,569
I've got to get out of here.

57
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:59,020
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

58
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:02,326
...whether you want it to or not.
It's silly.

59
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:06,068
Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?

60
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:11,744
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

61
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:13,344
Over 60 years.

62
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:16,344
Paul, I'm your friend.

63
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,651
I ever tell you that I was
a prison guard during the Depression?

64
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,723
You've mentioned it.

65
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:30,085
Did I mention I was
in charge of death row?

66
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,526
That I supervised all the executions?

67
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:41,631
Usually, death row is called
''The Last Mile.''

68
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:44,443
We called ours ''The Green Mile.''

69
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:48,171
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

70
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:51,676
We had the electric chair.

71
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:53,914
''Old Sparky,'' we called it.

72
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:59,155
I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

73
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,793
...but 1 935, that takes the prize.

74
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,894
That year, I had...

75
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:10,364
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

76
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,504
It was....

77
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,805
It was also the year of...

78
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,505
...John Coffey...

79
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,081
...and the two dead girls.

80
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:39,681
Put me through to E Block.

81
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:55,106
E Block.

82
00:10:57,343 --> 00:10:58,571
Right.

83
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:21,998
Paul? Prisoner.

84
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,793
Christ, give me a minute.

85
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,603
You all right?

86
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,215
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.

87
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,098
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

88
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,030
With the new arrival?
You know better.

89
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:59,127
Besides...

90
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,131
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

91
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,075
-Let's look alive, Dean.
-Yes, sir.

92
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:16,682
Damn.

93
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,981
They're riding on the axle.

94
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,035
What'd they do?

95
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,032
They bust the springs?

96
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:43,339
Dead man!

97
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:45,778
Dead man walking!

98
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:49,518
We got a dead man walking here!

99
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,847
Jesus please us,
what is he yelling about?

100
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,965
You might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

101
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,600
He's enormous.

102
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:04,770
Can't be bigger than you.

103
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:16,579
Dead man!

104
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,912
Dead man walking!

105
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,585
Dead man!

106
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,314
Dead man walking!

107
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,482
Dead man walking here!

108
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,056
Dead man!

109
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,528
We got a dead man walking here!

110
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:36,396
Dead man walking!

111
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:41,235
-We got a dead man walking here!
-Percy.

112
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:43,937
That's enough.

113
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,567
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

114
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,732
Can you talk?

115
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:25,310
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

116
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:34,724
Move your ass.

117
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:36,419
Let's go.

118
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,328
Come on.

119
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:44,568
Percy...

120
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,736
...they're moving house
in the infirmary.

121
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:52,243
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

122
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,640
They got all the men they need.

123
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:56,941
Why don't you just make sure?

124
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:03,482
I don't care where you go, as long as
it's not here at this moment.

125
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,057
All right.

126
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:24,304
God, you bust my finger.

127
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,910
I wiped that grin
off your face, didn't I?

128
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:29,445
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

129
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:43,521
Fuck you, Percy.

130
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:46,960
We'll get that looked at, Del.
In the meantime, stay quiet.

131
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,301
I let Harry take those chains off you...

132
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:58,138
...you gonna be nice?

133
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:16,818
Your name is John Coffey.

134
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:18,821
Yes, sir, boss.

135
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:22,523
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

136
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:24,335
You can spell, can you?

137
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:27,935
Just my name, boss.

138
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:31,040
J...O--

139
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,411
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

140
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:37,111
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

141
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,410
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

142
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,082
Questions?

143
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:47,224
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

144
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:53,421
Because I get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

145
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,694
...if it's a strange place.

146
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,567
It stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

147
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:08,372
We keep a few lights burning
in the corridor.

148
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:11,473
The corridor?

149
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:14,485
Right out there.

150
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:44,206
You can sit.

151
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,871
I couldn't help it, boss.

152
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:12,542
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

153
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:22,779
Take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

154
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:25,548
Of course they are.
I heard the bones crack.

155
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:28,556
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

156
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:30,729
How could I miss it?
The whole prison heard.

157
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:32,826
Goddamn Percy.

158
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:36,501
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

159
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,660
I'll chew that food when I have to.

160
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:44,341
Right now I wanna hear about this
new inmate. Aside from how big he is.

161
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:47,242
Monstrous big. Damn.

162
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:49,437
He seems meek enough.

163
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:51,411
Is he retarded, you figure?

164
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:54,518
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

165
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,019
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

166
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:03,619
Make your blood curdle.

167
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:31,583
-What?! For God's sake, what?
-The girls! The girls are gone!

168
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:35,259
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

169
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,395
Oh, my God.

170
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:50,666
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone.
You tell them we headed west.

171
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,970
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

172
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,614
Central! Are you on the line?

173
00:19:56,816 --> 00:20:00,980
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

174
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:14,125
IKatie!

175
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,658
Cora!

176
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,224
Jesus.

177
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:51,692
Jesus.

178
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:03,947
I'll kill you!

179
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,381
I'll kill you!

180
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:39,844
I couldn't help it.

181
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:44,481
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

182
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:51,290
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

183
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:54,856
I interrupt?

184
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:59,097
Well, I'm just about done.

185
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:12,373
How's your pretty gal?

186
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,550
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

187
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,449
Not so well at all.

188
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,724
More headaches?

189
00:22:22,328 --> 00:22:24,956
Got laid up with another one yesterday.

190
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:27,030
Worst one yet.

191
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:31,692
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

192
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:35,469
Head x-rays and who knows what else.

193
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:38,438
She is scared to death.

194
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:42,503
Truth to tell, so am I.

195
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:46,650
If it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

196
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:49,049
...maybe they can fix it.

197
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:51,317
Maybe.

198
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,522
This just came in.

199
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,096
DOE on Bitterbuck.

200
00:23:03,102 --> 00:23:05,593
You didn't come down here
to hand me a DOE.

201
00:23:06,672 --> 00:23:10,699
I had an angry call from the
state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

202
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:13,609
Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

203
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:15,109
It is.

204
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:19,542
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

205
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:23,552
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

206
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:25,621
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

207
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:27,758
Little Percy calls his aunt...

208
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,452
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

209
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:37,196
He mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

210
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:40,133
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

211
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:42,966
I didn't hear that.
I'm sure she didn't either.

212
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:45,075
He is mean, careless and stupid...

213
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:48,041
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

214
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:50,838
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

215
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,381
Stick with it, Paul.

216
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:54,343
It may not be much longer.

217
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:58,990
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

218
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:01,853
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

219
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,392
Administration job.

220
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:05,093
Better pay.

221
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:08,791
Then why is he still here?

222
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:13,000
He can get that application
pushed through.

223
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:18,505
With his connections, he could have
any state job he wants.

224
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,972
You know what I think?

225
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:26,574
I think he just wants to
see one cook up close.

226
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:33,515
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

227
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:38,556
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

228
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:40,531
...you'll keep the peace?

229
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,029
Of course.

230
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:44,663
Of course.

231
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:47,700
Thank you, Paul.

232
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:52,701
Hal...

233
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,272
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

234
00:24:56,782 --> 00:25:01,014
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

235
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:03,615
You bet.

236
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:36,052
The music too loud?

237
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:41,719
There's just this empty spot
in the bed where my husband sleeps.

238
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:47,924
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

239
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:53,564
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

240
00:25:54,273 --> 00:25:56,207
Is that what's got you up?

241
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:58,934
Yeah, that...

242
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,746
...and things.

243
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:04,271
Things.

244
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:11,885
We got a new inmate today.

245
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:14,526
Simple-minded fella.

246
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,054
Do I wanna know what he did?

247
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:20,187
No.

248
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,828
Things that happen in this world.

249
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:27,599
It's a wonder God allows it.

250
00:26:31,977 --> 00:26:33,877
Why don't you come to bed?

251
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:37,807
I think I have something
that'll help you sleep.

252
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:41,311
You can have all you want.

253
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:44,946
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

254
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:47,148
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

255
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,517
Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?

256
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,820
No.

257
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:55,228
He'll want me to take sulfa tablets...

258
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:57,902
...and I'll spend the week
puking in my office.

259
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:02,164
It will run its course by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

260
00:27:05,077 --> 00:27:06,544
Poor old guy.

261
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:38,705
The legislature loosened up the purse
strings enough to hire on a new guard.

262
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:48,680
Look again.

263
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,352
He's right...

264
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:51,781
...there.

265
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,866
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people.

266
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,968
-Maybe it's rabid.
-Oh, my Christ.

267
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:09,970
-It could be.
-Oh, the big mouse expert.

268
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,338
The Mouse Man.

269
00:28:13,078 --> 00:28:15,478
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

270
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,876
I don't see its mouth at all.

271
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:31,326
-Brutal, we'll be hip-deep in mice.
-I just wanna see what he'll do.

272
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,890
In the interest of science, like.

273
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:16,364
He's in the damn restraint room.

274
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:18,975
He's chewing the padding
out of the walls...

275
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:21,145
...making himself a nice little nest.

276
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:27,985
All right.

277
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:30,817
Let's go get the damn mouse.

278
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,565
Boss.

279
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:46,136
Saw me a mouse go by.

280
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:48,536
Can't put anything over on you.

281
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:23,704
You let him get past you.

282
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,343
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

283
00:30:26,545 --> 00:30:28,376
Then where the hell is he?

284
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,070
Well, I don't know.

285
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,416
Three grown men...

286
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:37,747
...outsmarted by a mouse.

287
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:45,093
Bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

288
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:50,599
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

289
00:31:41,753 --> 00:31:44,654
You little son of a bitch.

290
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:48,158
Well, I'll be damned.

291
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,224
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

292
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:56,133
That's a goddamn mouse.

293
00:31:57,202 --> 00:32:00,296
Brute said he was
in here last night...

294
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:02,097
...begging for food.

295
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:04,769
He come right on up to the desk.

296
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:07,137
Give him some room.

297
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,474
See what he does.

298
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:25,022
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

299
00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:54,992
Goddamn!

300
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,724
You little scurvy!

301
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:01,755
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

302
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,065
I'm gonna kill you!

303
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:07,832
I'm gonna take you out!

304
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,532
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

305
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:14,769
It's just a little mouse, dumb merde.

306
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,743
You ugly little piece of sh--

307
00:33:17,983 --> 00:33:19,610
-Are you listening to me?
-Fuck!

308
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:23,547
I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

309
00:33:23,755 --> 00:33:25,188
...you little piece of shit!

310
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:48,471
Percy met your mouse.

311
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:55,345
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

312
00:33:57,722 --> 00:34:00,156
Percy, we already tried that.

313
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:05,095
What'd you say?

314
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:06,786
I said that we--

315
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:13,764
Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

316
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:30,953
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

317
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:34,289
Don't that beat the mousy band?

318
00:34:40,198 --> 00:34:42,462
You wanna think about
what you were doing?

319
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:46,296
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

320
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:49,996
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

321
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,835
...not to mention the inmates.

322
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,407
So what?

323
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:57,138
They aren't in cradle school,
case you didn't notice.

324
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,774
Although you treat them that way.

325
00:34:59,984 --> 00:35:03,147
We don't scare them
any more than we have to.

326
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:04,946
They're under enough strain.

327
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,283
Men under strain can snap.

328
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:10,986
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

329
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:13,429
...talking...

330
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:15,655
...not yelling.

331
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:19,801
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

332
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:23,502
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

333
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:25,406
That's all.

334
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:28,471
Anybody doesn't like it?

335
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,910
You can kiss my ass.

336
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:33,980
You try it. Go on.

337
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:37,882
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

338
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:39,681
Okay, Brutal.

339
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,436
We all know who your connections are.

340
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:59,069
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

341
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:00,844
Job be damned.

342
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:04,881
You done?

343
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:12,150
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

344
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:35,506
Arlen...

345
00:36:35,914 --> 00:36:38,280
...your daughter and her family
are here.

346
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:48,749
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

347
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,264
Sitting down, sitting down!

348
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:56,160
Rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

349
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,301
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

350
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:02,102
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

351
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:05,606
-Is his head properly shaved?
-It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

352
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,277
I will take that as a yes.

353
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:08,843
Let's go, Arlen.

354
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:12,716
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

355
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:16,682
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

356
00:37:16,888 --> 00:37:18,788
...walking the Mile.

357
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,050
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

358
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,990
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

359
00:37:25,196 --> 00:37:29,656
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

360
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:32,336
And I hope they forgive me...

361
00:37:32,537 --> 00:37:35,301
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

362
00:37:36,374 --> 00:37:39,366
We're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

363
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:41,545
...hollering and shaking his dick.

364
00:37:41,746 --> 00:37:44,306
-Actually--
-Still praying, still praying.

365
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,642
-Getting right with Jesus.
-Do it quietly!

366
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,318
You old gink!

367
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:49,720
As I was saying...

368
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,583
...I don't believe they actually
shake their dicks.

369
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:56,282
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

370
00:37:56,494 --> 00:38:00,021
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked up.

371
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:03,098
On your feet, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

372
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:06,064
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

373
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:09,604
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

374
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:11,672
Walking the Mile.

375
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:13,605
Walking in the Mile.

376
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:16,544
Sitting down now.

377
00:38:17,248 --> 00:38:20,581
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

378
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:22,009
What do I do?

379
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:24,748
Watch and learn.

380
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:33,087
Getting strapped.

381
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:35,897
Getting clamped.

382
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,229
Getting wired.

383
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:42,402
All right.

384
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,706
Getting all electrode.

385
00:38:51,382 --> 00:38:52,440
Roll on one.

386
00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:56,376
''Roll on one'' means I turn
the generator up full.

387
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,782
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

388
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,719
Arlen Bitterbuck...

389
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:03,560
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

390
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:06,958
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

391
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:09,966
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

392
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:16,738
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

393
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:19,368
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face...

394
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:22,307
...because I'm one horny motherfucker.

395
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:27,975
You bastard.

396
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,583
That's a good one.

397
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:32,183
Quiet.

398
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:33,715
Quiet! Shut up!

399
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:36,416
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

400
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:40,791
One more remark like that, I'll
have Van Hay roll on two for real.

401
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:43,490
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

402
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:45,658
It was pretty funny.

403
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,430
I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

404
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:53,000
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

405
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:55,544
Ever try not to laugh in church...

406
00:39:55,747 --> 00:39:58,079
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

407
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:01,008
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

408
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:02,843
Let's keep going.

409
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,422
Soak the sponge.

410
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:15,688
Putting on the black hood.

411
00:40:18,636 --> 00:40:20,194
And putting on my cap.

412
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:22,430
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

413
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,609
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

414
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,805
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

415
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,581
Hush up there, Toot.

416
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,481
Getting screwed.

417
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,392
I'm getting the cap.

418
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:48,023
Arlen Bitterbuck...

419
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:51,599
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

420
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:54,066
...in accordance with state law.

421
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,871
God have mercy on your soul.

422
00:40:58,176 --> 00:40:59,609
Amen.

423
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:03,139
Roll on two.

424
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:08,709
And that's that.

425
00:41:11,656 --> 00:41:15,023
I'm frying! I'm frying!

426
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,855
I'm a done tom turkey!

427
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:24,433
This is a shocking experience!

428
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:28,197
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

429
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:37,943
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

430
00:41:38,149 --> 00:41:40,549
Get that idiot out of the chair.

431
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:45,275
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

432
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:49,809
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

433
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,184
...and live there forever?

434
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:56,617
Could that be what heaven's like?

435
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:00,623
I just about believe that very thing.

436
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:09,970
Had me a young wife when I was 1 8.

437
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:15,305
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

438
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,108
And she'd lie there after...

439
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:22,417
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

440
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:26,885
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

441
00:43:30,161 --> 00:43:32,425
That was my best time.

442
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,111
It'll be fine.

443
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:57,014
You'll do fine.

444
00:44:33,124 --> 00:44:36,855
Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

445
00:44:37,061 --> 00:44:41,122
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

446
00:44:41,332 --> 00:44:43,732
God have mercy on your soul.

447
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:04,648
Roll on two.

448
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:50,297
Again.

449
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:58,869
Adiós, chief.

450
00:45:59,243 --> 00:46:03,839
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

451
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,577
He's paid what he owed.

452
00:46:08,986 --> 00:46:11,284
He's square with the house again...

453
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,185
...so keep your goddamn hands off him!

454
00:46:34,345 --> 00:46:36,176
What's up his ass?

455
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,677
You.

456
00:46:38,682 --> 00:46:41,276
Always. You, Percy.

457
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:45,049
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

458
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:50,323
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

459
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:53,694
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

460
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:57,497
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

461
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:02,327
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

462
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:04,907
Yeah, you heard me.

463
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:08,104
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

464
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:15,952
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

465
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:18,587
I just wanna be out front, is all.

466
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,858
Come on. One time.

467
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,560
And then you know what?

468
00:47:24,762 --> 00:47:27,697
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

469
00:47:27,898 --> 00:47:29,729
And if I say no?

470
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:34,393
Well, I might just
stick around for good.

471
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:37,139
Make me a career of this...

472
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:39,773
...boss.

473
00:48:32,596 --> 00:48:33,927
You won't believe this.

474
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,706
Look.

475
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:49,802
I done tame me that mouse.

476
00:48:50,814 --> 00:48:52,213
We see that.

477
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:56,581
Watch this. Watch what he do.

478
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:06,262
Ain't he something now?

479
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:09,461
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

480
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:11,828
-Mr. Jingles?
-That his name.

481
00:49:12,236 --> 00:49:14,397
He whispered in my ear.

482
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:15,997
Hey, captain...

483
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:19,869
...could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

484
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:22,739
Your English gets better
when you want something.

485
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:24,881
Wanna see what else he can do?

486
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:27,851
Watch, watch.

487
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:31,078
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

488
00:49:31,455 --> 00:49:32,888
Wanna play fetch?

489
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:35,989
Play fetch. Watch, watch, watch.

490
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:58,111
He fetch it every time. Every time.

491
00:49:58,882 --> 00:50:03,581
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

492
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:08,952
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

493
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:11,184
When I get out,
he'll make me rich.

494
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,927
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

495
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:16,426
We play fetch again?

496
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:18,898
Well, well, well.

497
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,565
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

498
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:23,604
Don't hurt him.

499
00:50:26,243 --> 00:50:27,574
Is that the one I chased?

500
00:50:27,978 --> 00:50:29,639
Yeah, that's the one.

501
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:33,412
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

502
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:35,474
Is that so?

503
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:38,449
Del's been asking for a box.

504
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:40,985
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it.

505
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:43,052
Might keep it for a pet.

506
00:50:45,429 --> 00:50:46,726
What do you think?

507
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:51,799
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

508
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:56,899
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

509
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,271
That should do real nice.

510
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:14,123
Man said get a cigar box.

511
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,530
Hal, you wanted to see me?

512
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:35,702
Close the door.

513
00:51:42,986 --> 00:51:44,715
So you know...

514
00:51:46,223 --> 00:51:48,714
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

515
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:51,488
''William Wharton.''

516
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:53,890
He's what you call...

517
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:56,166
...a problem child.

518
00:51:57,034 --> 00:52:00,731
Got ''Billy the IKid'' tattooed
on his left arm.

519
00:52:00,938 --> 00:52:04,999
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

520
00:52:05,442 --> 00:52:07,637
...causing all kinds of trouble.

521
00:52:08,412 --> 00:52:10,346
Finally hit the big time.

522
00:52:11,749 --> 00:52:15,048
IKilled three people in a holdup.

523
00:52:15,252 --> 00:52:17,379
One of them a pregnant woman.

524
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,881
Bad news all around.

525
00:52:36,306 --> 00:52:37,568
It's a tumor, Paul.

526
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,972
A brain tumor.

527
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:43,873
They got...

528
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:46,808
...x-ray pictures of it.

529
00:52:48,218 --> 00:52:50,743
It's the size of a lemon, they said.

530
00:52:53,457 --> 00:52:54,719
And...

531
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:57,417
...way down...

532
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,458
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

533
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,161
I haven't told her.

534
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:08,905
I can't think how.

535
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:14,803
For the life of me, Paul...

536
00:53:16,313 --> 00:53:19,305
...I can't think how to
tell my wife...

537
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:24,754
...she's going to die.

538
00:54:49,406 --> 00:54:51,499
Oh, oh, God.

539
00:54:52,175 --> 00:54:53,733
Oh, God.

540
00:54:57,614 --> 00:54:59,013
I'm going.

541
00:54:59,216 --> 00:55:00,148
What?

542
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,217
To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

543
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:05,020
Today.

544
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:08,252
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

545
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,819
That bad?

546
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:11,960
Oh, yeah.

547
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:36,246
The boy's doped to the gills.

548
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:40,450
Hand me them clothes.

549
00:55:43,493 --> 00:55:45,393
William Wharton?

550
00:55:47,164 --> 00:55:49,029
You put on these clothes now.

551
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,266
We'll have to do this.

552
00:56:00,477 --> 00:56:02,104
Hellraiser, huh?

553
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:04,974
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

554
00:56:08,752 --> 00:56:12,552
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

555
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,985
You're gonna ride the lightning.

556
00:56:18,095 --> 00:56:19,722
Shut up, give us a hand.

557
00:56:20,597 --> 00:56:22,292
Hellraiser.

558
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:54,753
You don't look so good.

559
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:58,701
Look like you're running you a fever.

560
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:06,066
Boss Edgecomb?

561
00:57:07,577 --> 00:57:09,511
I needs to see you down here.

562
00:57:12,082 --> 00:57:14,380
I got things to tend to, John Coffey.

563
00:57:17,054 --> 00:57:20,421
You just stay still in your cell.

564
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:33,230
E Block.

565
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:10,963
Come on, let's go.

566
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:14,302
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

567
00:58:28,992 --> 00:58:30,220
Careful.

568
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,628
Careful.

569
00:58:34,831 --> 00:58:35,661
Step up.

570
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:36,898
Step up.

571
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:18,938
Ain't this a party now?

572
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:20,468
-Is it or what?
-Let him go.

573
00:59:20,677 --> 00:59:22,304
-Shoot him.
-See who you hit.

574
00:59:22,512 --> 00:59:23,979
Shoot the son of a bitch.

575
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:25,111
Shoot him!

576
00:59:25,348 --> 00:59:27,976
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it! Hit him.

577
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:29,652
Hit me, you limp noodle.

578
00:59:29,853 --> 00:59:30,751
Hit him, Percy!

579
00:59:30,954 --> 00:59:32,148
Goddamn it, hit him!

580
00:59:32,355 --> 00:59:33,652
Come on, Percy. Hit me.

581
00:59:34,457 --> 00:59:35,321
I'm warning you.

582
00:59:35,525 --> 00:59:36,924
You warning me?

583
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,358
I'm warning you!

584
00:59:38,562 --> 00:59:40,587
-You're warning me?!
-Shoot him!

585
00:59:40,797 --> 00:59:42,162
Well, come on--

586
00:59:48,738 --> 00:59:49,762
You're a big fucker.

587
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:52,440
Where'd you come from?

588
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:05,544
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

589
01:00:05,755 --> 01:00:07,313
All right. Let it breathe.

590
01:00:07,891 --> 01:00:09,984
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

591
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:13,590
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

592
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:16,799
-Didn't see it coming.
-Come on, boy, breathe.

593
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,025
Come on. Just breathe.

594
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:23,998
We thought he was doped.

595
01:00:25,275 --> 01:00:28,540
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

596
01:00:28,745 --> 01:00:30,474
You didn't ask?

597
01:00:31,781 --> 01:00:33,646
I guess that's not a mistake...

598
01:00:34,017 --> 01:00:37,248
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

599
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:54,930
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

600
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:58,899
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

601
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:01,669
Say the situation's under control.
It's not a story.

602
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:04,540
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

603
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,978
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

604
01:01:07,217 --> 01:01:10,550
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

605
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:13,289
Go on now. Go.

606
01:01:20,964 --> 01:01:24,092
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

607
01:01:49,693 --> 01:01:53,129
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

608
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:59,897
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

609
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:02,071
...not a good time at all.

610
01:02:02,272 --> 01:02:06,402
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

611
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:29,762
Closer.

612
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,359
You know you ain't
supposed to do that.

613
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:35,971
Mind your business, Del.

614
01:02:45,615 --> 01:02:47,640
What do you want, John Coffey?

615
01:02:48,718 --> 01:02:49,810
Just to help it.

616
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:54,923
Don't be afraid.

617
01:02:55,492 --> 01:02:56,516
Help!

618
01:02:57,327 --> 01:02:58,191
Help!

619
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:00,124
Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

620
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,820
Help!

621
01:03:02,031 --> 01:03:03,123
What are you doing?

622
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,702
Boss Howell! Help!

623
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:12,136
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

624
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:33,090
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

625
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:36,265
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

626
01:03:36,466 --> 01:03:39,094
Del, for chrissakes, shut up!

627
01:04:25,682 --> 01:04:27,912
What did you just do to me?

628
01:04:29,886 --> 01:04:31,581
I helped it.

629
01:04:32,655 --> 01:04:34,282
Didn't I help it?

630
01:04:35,391 --> 01:04:37,621
I just took it back, is all.

631
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:40,896
Awful tired now, boss.

632
01:04:41,431 --> 01:04:43,126
Dog-tired.

633
01:05:07,257 --> 01:05:10,283
Boss, what that man do to you?

634
01:06:12,755 --> 01:06:15,519
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

635
01:06:17,327 --> 01:06:20,091
Oh, not too bad.

636
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:23,094
What did the doctor say?

637
01:06:25,335 --> 01:06:27,064
You know doctors.

638
01:06:27,503 --> 01:06:29,403
Gobbledygook, mostly.

639
01:06:30,506 --> 01:06:31,871
Gobbledygook.

640
01:06:47,123 --> 01:06:48,715
Having stew tonight.

641
01:06:59,035 --> 01:07:00,730
What are you doing?

642
01:07:07,443 --> 01:07:09,308
What does it feel like?

643
01:07:10,179 --> 01:07:12,613
Well, I know what it feels like.

644
01:07:16,252 --> 01:07:18,152
It feels great.

645
01:07:54,924 --> 01:07:57,654
Not that I'm complaining...

646
01:07:58,795 --> 01:08:02,526
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 1 9.

647
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:05,131
Yeah, we did, at your mom's.

648
01:08:06,636 --> 01:08:08,627
Wanna tell me what's going on?

649
01:08:12,442 --> 01:08:13,466
Well...

650
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:17,102
...see, the thing is...

651
01:08:18,314 --> 01:08:21,875
...I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

652
01:08:25,054 --> 01:08:27,852
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

653
01:08:28,057 --> 01:08:32,494
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

654
01:08:33,563 --> 01:08:35,827
That's swell. Thanks.

655
01:08:36,032 --> 01:08:38,660
Yeah, I'm sure I'll feel better.

656
01:08:46,909 --> 01:08:48,877
You're sure you ought to do this?

657
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,710
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

658
01:09:09,532 --> 01:09:12,524
Burt, you got some company.

659
01:09:13,202 --> 01:09:14,794
Can I offer you a cold drink?

660
01:09:15,037 --> 01:09:18,131
Yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

661
01:09:18,474 --> 01:09:21,568
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

662
01:09:21,778 --> 01:09:23,439
Hope I'm not troubling you.

663
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:26,206
Well, that depends, Mr...?

664
01:09:26,415 --> 01:09:30,442
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

665
01:09:31,654 --> 01:09:33,019
The Green Mile.

666
01:09:33,222 --> 01:09:36,350
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

667
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:38,855
I'd like to ask you about one.

668
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:42,988
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

669
01:09:47,737 --> 01:09:48,704
Which client?

670
01:09:50,973 --> 01:09:53,771
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

671
01:09:53,976 --> 01:09:55,307
John Coffey.

672
01:09:56,512 --> 01:09:57,638
Coffey.

673
01:09:58,114 --> 01:09:59,308
Causing you problems?

674
01:09:59,782 --> 01:10:03,343
Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

675
01:10:03,553 --> 01:10:05,418
...but other than that....

676
01:10:05,588 --> 01:10:08,887
He cries, does he?
Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

677
01:10:09,091 --> 01:10:10,649
You know what he did.

678
01:10:11,327 --> 01:10:13,352
I read the court transcript.

679
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:15,093
Thank you, missus.

680
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:17,027
My pleasure.

681
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,730
IKids!

682
01:10:18,935 --> 01:10:21,199
Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

683
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:22,734
Coming, Mama!

684
01:10:22,939 --> 01:10:26,067
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

685
01:10:26,676 --> 01:10:29,008
I wonder if he did anything
like that before.

686
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:32,447
Why? Has he said anything?

687
01:10:32,648 --> 01:10:35,811
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

688
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:39,920
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

689
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:44,024
...that it might be easy enough to
follow his back trail. Find out.

690
01:10:44,794 --> 01:10:48,594
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

691
01:10:48,798 --> 01:10:51,790
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

692
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:54,128
Believe me, we tried.

693
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:57,166
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

694
01:10:57,974 --> 01:10:59,407
How can that be?

695
01:10:59,642 --> 01:11:03,840
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

696
01:11:04,046 --> 01:11:08,073
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

697
01:11:08,317 --> 01:11:11,445
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

698
01:11:12,221 --> 01:11:14,553
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

699
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:16,983
He is...

700
01:11:17,326 --> 01:11:19,385
...strange, I admit.

701
01:11:19,762 --> 01:11:24,062
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

702
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,934
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

703
01:11:27,169 --> 01:11:30,002
I deal with them day in and day out.

704
01:11:30,806 --> 01:11:33,468
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

705
01:11:33,676 --> 01:11:36,611
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

706
01:11:38,014 --> 01:11:38,912
Do you?

707
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:43,078
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

708
01:11:43,286 --> 01:11:45,345
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

709
01:11:45,554 --> 01:11:47,351
And yet you defended him.

710
01:11:48,357 --> 01:11:50,951
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

711
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,987
IKids! Lunch!

712
01:11:53,195 --> 01:11:54,492
Y'all listen to your mama!

713
01:11:59,135 --> 01:12:00,693
I'll tell you something.

714
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:05,366
You listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

715
01:12:05,574 --> 01:12:06,939
I'm listening.

716
01:12:08,377 --> 01:12:09,435
We had us a dog.

717
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:12,504
Just a sweet mongrel.

718
01:12:12,715 --> 01:12:14,205
You know the kind.

719
01:12:15,584 --> 01:12:19,020
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

720
01:12:19,889 --> 01:12:21,652
You get to know it.

721
01:12:21,857 --> 01:12:26,226
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

722
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:29,956
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

723
01:12:31,467 --> 01:12:35,597
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

724
01:12:36,672 --> 01:12:38,867
My wife and I were not so lucky.

725
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:42,367
Caleb, come here for a second.

726
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:44,973
Come here.

727
01:12:46,415 --> 01:12:47,677
Please, son.

728
01:12:49,285 --> 01:12:51,753
He still has the one good eye.

729
01:12:53,122 --> 01:12:55,386
I suppose he's lucky...

730
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:57,957
...not to be completely blind.

731
01:13:00,663 --> 01:13:04,429
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

732
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:06,500
Right, Caleb?

733
01:13:09,338 --> 01:13:10,270
Go on in, now.

734
01:13:13,709 --> 01:13:16,644
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

735
01:13:17,246 --> 01:13:19,441
Just got it in his mind one day.

736
01:13:20,216 --> 01:13:21,683
The same with John Coffey.

737
01:13:21,884 --> 01:13:26,116
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

738
01:13:26,789 --> 01:13:28,654
But those little girls...

739
01:13:28,858 --> 01:13:31,292
...stayed raped and murdered.

740
01:13:31,961 --> 01:13:33,952
Maybe he'd never done it before.

741
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:37,892
My dog never bit before.

742
01:13:39,635 --> 01:13:42,365
But I didn't concern myself with that.

743
01:13:43,372 --> 01:13:47,331
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

744
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:49,871
Is Coffey guilty?

745
01:13:52,815 --> 01:13:54,544
Yes, he is.

746
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:56,812
Don't you doubt it.

747
01:13:57,186 --> 01:13:59,654
And don't you turn your back on him.

748
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:04,653
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

749
01:14:05,494 --> 01:14:07,155
...but in the end...

750
01:14:09,165 --> 01:14:10,632
...you'll get bit.

751
01:14:23,212 --> 01:14:25,737
Oh, me! Oh, my!

752
01:14:32,588 --> 01:14:34,818
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

753
01:14:35,257 --> 01:14:37,157
It's from my missus.

754
01:14:40,863 --> 01:14:43,229
She wanted to thank you.

755
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,999
Thank me for what?

756
01:14:46,435 --> 01:14:47,697
Well, you know.

757
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:51,838
For helping me.

758
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:54,099
Helping you with what?

759
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:55,936
You know.

760
01:15:02,485 --> 01:15:04,453
Was your missus pleased?

761
01:15:06,288 --> 01:15:07,949
Several times.

762
01:15:23,472 --> 01:15:26,964
John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

763
01:15:29,845 --> 01:15:32,143
Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

764
01:15:32,748 --> 01:15:36,309
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

765
01:15:39,355 --> 01:15:42,847
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

766
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:47,255
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't I?

767
01:15:49,365 --> 01:15:52,493
It's yours, John. As you please.

768
01:15:53,102 --> 01:15:55,764
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

769
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:03,840
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

770
01:16:06,081 --> 01:16:08,879
John, that's so very fine of you.

771
01:16:09,852 --> 01:16:13,754
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.
My mama'd thank you too, but she dead.

772
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,721
Welcome.

773
01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:21,156
What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

774
01:16:25,234 --> 01:16:26,701
Here come the boss man.

775
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:30,038
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

776
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,475
You get that one for free.

777
01:16:44,486 --> 01:16:46,113
But that's the last one.

778
01:16:46,889 --> 01:16:49,824
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

779
01:16:50,392 --> 01:16:53,725
I guess I'm gonna have to
pay you out for the rest.

780
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:09,066
Good shot, weren't it?

781
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:13,474
The look on your face!

782
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,412
You believe this?

783
01:17:19,622 --> 01:17:21,886
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

784
01:17:22,591 --> 01:17:24,559
Did y'all like that?

785
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,058
I'm cooking up some turds
to go with it.

786
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:28,890
Nice soft ones.

787
01:17:29,999 --> 01:17:32,297
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

788
01:17:33,802 --> 01:17:37,602
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

789
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:42,199
Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

790
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,739
What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

791
01:17:46,949 --> 01:17:49,076
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

792
01:17:49,518 --> 01:17:52,885
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

793
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:08,834
You can come in here on your legs...

794
01:18:09,038 --> 01:18:11,404
...but you'll go out on your backs.

795
01:18:11,607 --> 01:18:14,872
Billy the IKid gonna
guarantee you that.

796
01:18:15,244 --> 01:18:16,211
Come on, fuck-stick.

797
01:18:16,578 --> 01:18:20,742
No sneaking up on me this time.
We'll go man-to-man.

798
01:18:24,219 --> 01:18:25,311
Piss on me?

799
01:18:51,914 --> 01:18:54,576
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

800
01:18:54,783 --> 01:18:59,152
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

801
01:18:59,355 --> 01:19:01,380
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

802
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:05,151
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

803
01:19:05,361 --> 01:19:07,295
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

804
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:11,832
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

805
01:19:13,936 --> 01:19:15,597
Thank you, Wild Bill.

806
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:25,078
Not in there.

807
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,542
I'll be good.

808
01:19:26,749 --> 01:19:29,343
Honest injun, I will. I will.

809
01:19:34,423 --> 01:19:35,822
He's pitching a fit.

810
01:19:36,024 --> 01:19:38,857
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

811
01:19:47,903 --> 01:19:48,870
Hey, fellers!

812
01:19:55,544 --> 01:19:58,672
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

813
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:01,475
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

814
01:20:09,358 --> 01:20:11,519
I learned my lesson.

815
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,318
I'll be good.

816
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,433
Hey, Toot.

817
01:20:29,611 --> 01:20:31,602
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

818
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:12,549
Little Black Sambo!

819
01:21:13,655 --> 01:21:17,455
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

820
01:21:18,827 --> 01:21:21,057
Hope your bags are packed.

821
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:23,421
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

822
01:21:23,632 --> 01:21:25,600
Where are we going? Let's go!

823
01:21:38,981 --> 01:21:41,347
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original.

824
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,108
Gotta give him that.

825
01:22:01,203 --> 01:22:04,866
Del, grab up your things. It's
a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

826
01:22:05,073 --> 01:22:06,438
What you talking about?

827
01:22:06,642 --> 01:22:10,339
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

828
01:22:10,546 --> 01:22:11,911
Not just prison guards.

829
01:22:12,114 --> 01:22:15,345
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

830
01:22:17,452 --> 01:22:18,919
You fellas coming?

831
01:22:19,121 --> 01:22:22,613
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

832
01:22:23,725 --> 01:22:26,159
But you knock them for a loop.

833
01:22:26,361 --> 01:22:28,158
You knock them for a loop.

834
01:22:28,564 --> 01:22:30,794
Just like Mr. Harry says.

835
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:44,843
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

836
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,008
All right, rehearsing now!

837
01:22:48,216 --> 01:22:50,707
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

838
01:22:51,086 --> 01:22:54,351
I been fixing the plumbing here
for 1 0 years.

839
01:22:54,556 --> 01:22:56,820
Ain't never had to wear no tie before.

840
01:22:57,025 --> 01:23:00,984
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

841
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,824
All right, everybody have a seat.

842
01:23:20,716 --> 01:23:22,343
This is great.

843
01:23:31,126 --> 01:23:35,722
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

844
01:23:35,931 --> 01:23:37,455
...until you are dead...

845
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:40,032
...in accordance with state law.

846
01:23:40,369 --> 01:23:42,894
God have mercy on your soul.

847
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,740
Roll on two.

848
01:23:56,952 --> 01:23:57,884
That's that.

849
01:24:01,423 --> 01:24:04,415
Very good. Very professional.

850
01:24:06,928 --> 01:24:08,555
Let's do it again.

851
01:24:09,097 --> 01:24:12,157
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

852
01:24:12,367 --> 01:24:13,197
Thank you.

853
01:24:13,402 --> 01:24:16,838
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

854
01:24:17,072 --> 01:24:20,132
You got that chin strap tight,
because his head will buck--

855
01:24:20,642 --> 01:24:22,405
All right, break it up.

856
01:24:26,515 --> 01:24:27,709
So?

857
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:30,747
They love Mr. Jingles.
They laugh over there.

858
01:24:30,952 --> 01:24:35,286
They cheer. They clap their hands.

859
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:37,424
Well, that's just aces.

860
01:24:38,226 --> 01:24:39,887
Isn't that something?

861
01:24:40,095 --> 01:24:42,256
You done good, old-timer.

862
01:24:42,464 --> 01:24:44,261
We're happy for you.

863
01:24:45,767 --> 01:24:47,598
Yeah, we are.

864
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:05,517
Percy, you shit.

865
01:25:08,356 --> 01:25:09,186
Come on.

866
01:25:09,391 --> 01:25:10,483
Del, get up.

867
01:25:10,692 --> 01:25:14,287
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

868
01:25:14,496 --> 01:25:17,329
I was just playing. Come on, now.

869
01:25:17,532 --> 01:25:18,999
I was just having--

870
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,262
Ain't you sweet?

871
01:25:24,306 --> 01:25:26,365
Soft like a girl.

872
01:25:26,608 --> 01:25:28,508
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

873
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:30,735
...than your sister's pussy, I think.

874
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:32,307
Wharton!

875
01:25:37,652 --> 01:25:41,611
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

876
01:25:41,823 --> 01:25:44,257
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty head.

877
01:25:44,993 --> 01:25:47,791
Your noodle ain't
limp at all, lover-boy.

878
01:25:47,996 --> 01:25:50,692
I think you sweet on
old Billy the IKid.

879
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:55,227
But smell you.

880
01:26:01,943 --> 01:26:03,376
Look.

881
01:26:03,645 --> 01:26:05,044
He done piss his pants.

882
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:09,046
Oh, my God.

883
01:26:10,519 --> 01:26:12,316
Look what the big man done.

884
01:26:12,521 --> 01:26:14,853
He bust other people with a stick.

885
01:26:18,026 --> 01:26:22,292
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

886
01:26:25,233 --> 01:26:26,598
Learn when to shut up.

887
01:26:27,803 --> 01:26:29,532
All right, now.

888
01:26:31,006 --> 01:26:32,633
Don't touch me.

889
01:26:48,857 --> 01:26:51,553
You talk about this to anyone...

890
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,155
...I'll get you all fired.

891
01:26:55,831 --> 01:26:57,492
I swear that to God.

892
01:26:59,134 --> 01:27:03,662
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

893
01:27:10,412 --> 01:27:14,314
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

894
01:27:14,783 --> 01:27:17,013
You just keep on laughing!

895
01:27:19,788 --> 01:27:22,416
Wetmore a good name for you!

896
01:27:24,693 --> 01:27:26,593
Percy Wetmore do a dance

897
01:27:26,795 --> 01:27:29,696
Listen to him squishing in his pant

898
01:27:41,042 --> 01:27:44,136
Well, what about Dean?
He's got a little boy.

899
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:46,940
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

900
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:52,384
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

901
01:27:52,787 --> 01:27:55,187
Maybe forget to feed him.

902
01:27:55,624 --> 01:27:59,355
How he keep up with his training?
He just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

903
01:28:09,404 --> 01:28:11,668
All right. I'll take him, then.

904
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,464
Me.

905
01:28:14,809 --> 01:28:17,300
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you kindly, but...

906
01:28:18,713 --> 01:28:21,011
...you live out in the woods.

907
01:28:21,516 --> 01:28:22,881
Mr. Jingle, he be...

908
01:28:23,551 --> 01:28:26,816
...he be scared to live
out in the big woods.

909
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:33,389
How about Mouseville?

910
01:28:34,596 --> 01:28:35,563
Mouseville?

911
01:28:35,764 --> 01:28:38,198
Tourist attraction down in Florida.

912
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:40,725
Tallahassee, I think.

913
01:28:41,102 --> 01:28:43,502
Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

914
01:28:43,705 --> 01:28:44,865
Tallahassee.

915
01:28:45,073 --> 01:28:48,668
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

916
01:28:51,012 --> 01:28:54,880
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

917
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:57,442
You think he's got the stuff?

918
01:28:57,652 --> 01:28:59,552
I mean, he is pretty smart.

919
01:29:00,922 --> 01:29:02,514
What is Mouseville?

920
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,759
Tourist attraction, I said.

921
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,755
They got this big tent.

922
01:29:06,962 --> 01:29:10,090
-You have to pay?
-Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

923
01:29:10,465 --> 01:29:11,397
Dime apiece.

924
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:14,097
-Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

925
01:29:14,302 --> 01:29:16,463
Inside the tent they got this...

926
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:18,571
...mouse city...

927
01:29:19,407 --> 01:29:20,931
...made out of...

928
01:29:21,142 --> 01:29:25,806
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

929
01:29:26,214 --> 01:29:30,583
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

930
01:29:31,786 --> 01:29:34,755
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

931
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:38,483
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

932
01:29:42,597 --> 01:29:43,621
Yeah, that's it.

933
01:29:45,433 --> 01:29:47,162
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

934
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,232
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

935
01:29:55,677 --> 01:29:59,579
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

936
01:30:03,084 --> 01:30:03,948
There he goes.

937
01:30:12,427 --> 01:30:14,486
Mr. Jingles!

938
01:30:24,105 --> 01:30:26,164
I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

939
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:29,275
It was just a matter of time, really.

940
01:30:29,477 --> 01:30:32,605
You fucking cruel bastard!

941
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:42,713
Give him to me.

942
01:30:43,358 --> 01:30:46,020
Give him to me. Might still be time.

943
01:30:58,673 --> 01:31:00,231
What are you doing?

944
01:31:03,812 --> 01:31:05,473
What the hell--?

945
01:31:05,747 --> 01:31:07,476
Please, John.

946
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:09,878
Help him.

947
01:31:11,252 --> 01:31:13,311
Please, Johnny, help him.

948
01:31:17,225 --> 01:31:19,785
Oh, dear Jesus.

949
01:31:19,994 --> 01:31:21,393
The tail.

950
01:31:22,097 --> 01:31:23,223
Look at the tail.

951
01:32:53,721 --> 01:32:54,813
What'd you do?

952
01:32:55,356 --> 01:32:58,120
I helped Del's mouse...

953
01:32:58,459 --> 01:32:59,858
...his circus mouse.

954
01:33:00,528 --> 01:33:02,758
Gonna live in a mouse city...

955
01:33:02,964 --> 01:33:04,454
...down in....

956
01:33:06,467 --> 01:33:07,695
Florida.

957
01:33:10,838 --> 01:33:12,738
Boss Percy bad.

958
01:33:13,007 --> 01:33:17,000
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

959
01:33:18,012 --> 01:33:19,843
I took it back, though.

960
01:33:27,155 --> 01:33:28,486
Brute...

961
01:33:29,224 --> 01:33:31,215
...you come along with me.

962
01:33:31,526 --> 01:33:34,723
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

963
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,154
Now, don't start in on me.

964
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:03,548
It was just a mouse.

965
01:34:03,758 --> 01:34:06,124
Never belonged here
in the first place.

966
01:34:06,327 --> 01:34:08,090
The mouse is fine.

967
01:34:09,197 --> 01:34:10,027
Just fine.

968
01:34:10,231 --> 01:34:12,825
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are...

969
01:34:13,268 --> 01:34:15,236
...at anything else around here.

970
01:34:17,405 --> 01:34:19,771
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?

971
01:34:21,576 --> 01:34:24,170
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

972
01:34:24,379 --> 01:34:26,711
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

973
01:34:27,782 --> 01:34:30,080
After all those talks we had about...

974
01:34:30,585 --> 01:34:32,416
...keeping the prisoners calm?

975
01:34:33,087 --> 01:34:36,022
-Aren't you relieved?
-What kind of game is this?

976
01:34:36,224 --> 01:34:37,691
It's no game.

977
01:34:38,026 --> 01:34:39,391
See for yourself.

978
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:43,758
Go on.

979
01:34:57,111 --> 01:35:00,046
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

980
01:35:04,118 --> 01:35:07,451
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

981
01:35:08,156 --> 01:35:12,422
I always keep a spare mouse in
my wallet for occasions such as this.

982
01:35:12,627 --> 01:35:15,323
Yeah, you playing with me.
Both of you.

983
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:17,930
Just who the hell you think you are?

984
01:35:20,835 --> 01:35:22,598
We're the people you work with.

985
01:35:23,137 --> 01:35:24,729
But not for long.

986
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:27,741
Percy, I want your word.

987
01:35:28,309 --> 01:35:29,173
My word?

988
01:35:29,844 --> 01:35:32,472
I put you out front for Del...

989
01:35:33,414 --> 01:35:36,645
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the next day.

990
01:35:39,087 --> 01:35:43,649
What if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

991
01:35:43,858 --> 01:35:46,088
-Bullying me.
-Go ahead.

992
01:35:46,994 --> 01:35:49,861
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

993
01:35:50,064 --> 01:35:51,326
Over a mouse?

994
01:35:51,532 --> 01:35:52,726
No.

995
01:35:53,468 --> 01:35:57,905
But four men will swear you stood by
while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean.

996
01:35:58,106 --> 01:36:02,065
About that, people will care.
Even your uncle the governor.

997
01:36:02,276 --> 01:36:04,801
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

998
01:36:05,313 --> 01:36:09,647
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

999
01:36:09,884 --> 01:36:11,749
I put you out front...

1000
01:36:12,053 --> 01:36:14,351
...you put in for that transfer.

1001
01:36:15,923 --> 01:36:17,288
That's the deal.

1002
01:36:21,596 --> 01:36:22,790
All right.

1003
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:35,031
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1004
01:37:37,338 --> 01:37:39,101
Hey, boys.

1005
01:37:40,374 --> 01:37:43,673
No, now, say hey, Mr Jingles.

1006
01:37:45,847 --> 01:37:48,441
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1007
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:04,327
Boss Edgecomb.

1008
01:38:04,966 --> 01:38:06,456
Yes, Del?

1009
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:09,295
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1010
01:38:10,838 --> 01:38:13,568
Here. You take him.

1011
01:38:22,316 --> 01:38:25,410
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1012
01:38:26,888 --> 01:38:27,855
...you know.

1013
01:38:30,024 --> 01:38:31,753
I'll take him, boss.

1014
01:38:32,426 --> 01:38:34,917
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1015
01:38:39,767 --> 01:38:44,170
You take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1016
01:39:05,259 --> 01:39:07,193
You gonna take him to Mouseville?

1017
01:39:08,095 --> 01:39:10,359
We'll do it together, most likely.

1018
01:39:11,532 --> 01:39:13,864
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1019
01:39:15,202 --> 01:39:17,966
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1020
01:39:18,372 --> 01:39:21,170
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1021
01:39:21,275 --> 01:39:22,105
That's right, Del.

1022
01:39:25,314 --> 01:39:26,941
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1023
01:39:30,552 --> 01:39:32,042
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1024
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:39,283
I sure wish I could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1025
01:40:18,533 --> 01:40:20,467
Hope he's good and scared.

1026
01:40:20,736 --> 01:40:25,503
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1027
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,547
Del, it's all right.

1028
01:41:19,328 --> 01:41:20,522
Roll on one.

1029
01:41:32,274 --> 01:41:35,107
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1030
01:41:36,511 --> 01:41:39,947
You be so quiet and so still.

1031
01:41:43,618 --> 01:41:45,085
Eduard Delacroix...

1032
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,853
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1033
01:41:49,091 --> 01:41:52,891
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1034
01:41:53,295 --> 01:41:56,196
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1035
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,765
I sorry for what I--

1036
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:16,213
I sorry for what I do.

1037
01:42:16,618 --> 01:42:18,984
I give anything to take it back.

1038
01:42:20,022 --> 01:42:21,683
But I can't.

1039
01:42:22,891 --> 01:42:25,052
God have mercy on me.

1040
01:42:25,761 --> 01:42:27,854
Ainsi soit-il. Amen.

1041
01:42:36,471 --> 01:42:38,166
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1042
01:42:43,311 --> 01:42:44,801
There's no such place.

1043
01:42:45,714 --> 01:42:49,411
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1044
01:42:51,953 --> 01:42:54,444
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1045
01:43:56,551 --> 01:43:57,677
Eduard Delacroix...

1046
01:43:58,587 --> 01:44:02,148
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1047
01:44:02,657 --> 01:44:04,887
...in accordance with state law.

1048
01:44:06,027 --> 01:44:08,587
God have mercy on your soul.

1049
01:44:47,802 --> 01:44:48,928
Roll on two!

1050
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:06,914
The sponge is dry.

1051
01:45:07,122 --> 01:45:07,952
What?

1052
01:45:14,563 --> 01:45:17,327
-The goddamn sponge is dry!
-Well, don't you stop him!

1053
01:45:17,532 --> 01:45:20,160
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1054
01:45:35,283 --> 01:45:36,807
Is this normal?

1055
01:45:37,018 --> 01:45:39,680
God, the smell.

1056
01:45:40,855 --> 01:45:43,449
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1057
01:45:43,892 --> 01:45:45,519
They're about done, I reckon!

1058
01:45:50,365 --> 01:45:52,856
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1059
01:45:57,872 --> 01:45:59,737
He's cooking now!

1060
01:45:59,975 --> 01:46:02,102
He's cooking now!

1061
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:04,642
We gonna have a hoedown!

1062
01:46:04,913 --> 01:46:07,882
'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1063
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:09,981
Give me some!

1064
01:46:10,218 --> 01:46:12,209
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling--

1065
01:46:13,555 --> 01:46:15,614
I said give me some!

1066
01:46:19,227 --> 01:46:21,161
I smell it!

1067
01:46:23,298 --> 01:46:24,162
Smell it!

1068
01:46:31,973 --> 01:46:33,065
Should I kill the juice?

1069
01:46:33,341 --> 01:46:34,831
No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1070
01:46:58,433 --> 01:46:59,866
He's frying now!

1071
01:47:00,068 --> 01:47:01,695
He's frying now!

1072
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:06,004
Why don't you shut it down?

1073
01:47:06,207 --> 01:47:09,608
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1074
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:18,614
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1075
01:47:19,954 --> 01:47:22,684
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1076
01:47:23,224 --> 01:47:26,091
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1077
01:47:32,033 --> 01:47:32,863
IKill it!

1078
01:47:40,008 --> 01:47:40,940
You do it!

1079
01:47:41,142 --> 01:47:43,133
You're running this show, ain't you?

1080
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:13,599
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1081
01:48:16,077 --> 01:48:17,169
Brutal!

1082
01:48:17,412 --> 01:48:18,401
Brutal, no!

1083
01:48:19,214 --> 01:48:20,340
What do you mean, no?

1084
01:48:20,548 --> 01:48:22,277
You saw what he did!

1085
01:48:22,484 --> 01:48:25,476
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1086
01:48:25,687 --> 01:48:28,155
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1087
01:48:36,664 --> 01:48:39,861
What in the blue fuck was that?

1088
01:48:40,869 --> 01:48:42,336
Jesus Christ.

1089
01:48:42,537 --> 01:48:45,404
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1090
01:48:45,607 --> 01:48:47,370
And the smell.

1091
01:48:48,042 --> 01:48:51,944
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for 5 years.

1092
01:48:52,147 --> 01:48:53,808
That's what I'm betting.

1093
01:48:54,716 --> 01:48:58,083
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1094
01:48:58,553 --> 01:48:59,986
You can hear him up there!

1095
01:49:00,555 --> 01:49:03,149
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1096
01:49:13,802 --> 01:49:16,066
Okay, boys, okay.

1097
01:49:16,571 --> 01:49:19,597
Now, what in the hell happened?

1098
01:49:19,808 --> 01:49:21,366
An execution.

1099
01:49:21,676 --> 01:49:22,768
A successful one.

1100
01:49:23,178 --> 01:49:27,308
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1101
01:49:28,116 --> 01:49:30,641
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1102
01:49:32,353 --> 01:49:33,183
Isn't he?

1103
01:49:40,295 --> 01:49:41,523
Something to say?

1104
01:49:45,533 --> 01:49:47,933
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1105
01:49:49,304 --> 01:49:51,932
How many years you spend
pissing on the toilet seat...

1106
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:54,301
...before someone told you
to put it up?

1107
01:49:54,509 --> 01:49:56,306
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1108
01:49:56,511 --> 01:49:58,103
Pure and simple.

1109
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:00,477
That's your official position?

1110
01:50:00,682 --> 01:50:02,650
Don't you think it should be?

1111
01:50:03,017 --> 01:50:07,078
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1112
01:50:07,288 --> 01:50:09,756
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1113
01:50:10,124 --> 01:50:11,523
Isn't that right, Percy?

1114
01:50:14,662 --> 01:50:16,357
Barbecue

1115
01:50:16,564 --> 01:50:20,000
Me and you
Stinky, pinky

1116
01:50:21,069 --> 01:50:24,129
Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1117
01:50:24,339 --> 01:50:27,308
It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix

1118
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:30,208
Barbecue

1119
01:50:30,979 --> 01:50:32,344
Me and you

1120
01:50:32,547 --> 01:50:34,105
Stinky, pinky

1121
01:50:36,084 --> 01:50:37,608
Weren't Billy, Jilly--

1122
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:42,813
You're 1 0 seconds away from spending the
rest of your life in the padded room.

1123
01:51:01,175 --> 01:51:02,301
Poor old Del.

1124
01:51:06,214 --> 01:51:07,875
Poor old Del.

1125
01:51:13,955 --> 01:51:15,286
You okay?

1126
01:51:16,558 --> 01:51:18,788
I could feel it from here.

1127
01:51:19,427 --> 01:51:20,860
What do you mean?

1128
01:51:21,796 --> 01:51:23,388
You could hear it.

1129
01:51:23,631 --> 01:51:25,861
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1130
01:51:26,134 --> 01:51:28,034
He out of it now, though.

1131
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:30,701
He the lucky one.

1132
01:51:31,272 --> 01:51:34,969
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1133
01:51:41,749 --> 01:51:43,376
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1134
01:51:44,485 --> 01:51:46,953
He run away under that door.

1135
01:51:48,556 --> 01:51:50,717
Don't think he'll be back.

1136
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:54,685
He felt it too, through me.

1137
01:51:56,397 --> 01:51:58,456
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1138
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,992
All that hurt just spill out.

1139
01:52:08,743 --> 01:52:11,075
Awful tired now, boss.

1140
01:52:12,914 --> 01:52:14,609
Dog-tired.

1141
01:52:20,455 --> 01:52:22,082
Me too, John.

1142
01:52:24,826 --> 01:52:26,020
Me too.

1143
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,581
I hate this.

1144
01:53:28,356 --> 01:53:29,687
I know.

1145
01:53:51,412 --> 01:53:53,073
I am so happy to see you.

1146
01:53:55,016 --> 01:53:56,847
Look at you.

1147
01:53:57,752 --> 01:53:59,777
We missed you at church.

1148
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:05,991
My hair--

1149
01:54:06,227 --> 01:54:09,060
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1150
01:54:14,435 --> 01:54:16,733
She's having one of her good days.

1151
01:54:17,305 --> 01:54:19,205
I thank God for that.

1152
01:54:21,743 --> 01:54:23,438
What's a bad day?

1153
01:54:26,848 --> 01:54:28,713
Sometimes she's...

1154
01:54:30,184 --> 01:54:31,549
...she's not herself anymore.

1155
01:54:32,253 --> 01:54:33,652
She swears.

1156
01:54:33,888 --> 01:54:35,355
She swears?

1157
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:37,182
It just pops out.

1158
01:54:37,825 --> 01:54:40,453
Most awful language you can imagine.

1159
01:54:40,661 --> 01:54:42,959
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1160
01:54:44,298 --> 01:54:47,199
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1161
01:54:47,401 --> 01:54:50,564
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice....

1162
01:54:54,776 --> 01:54:57,267
I'm glad she's having a good day.

1163
01:54:58,412 --> 01:55:00,812
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1164
01:55:16,931 --> 01:55:18,057
Honey...

1165
01:55:18,566 --> 01:55:21,228
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1166
01:55:21,803 --> 01:55:25,000
...I'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1167
01:55:33,948 --> 01:55:35,973
I'm thinking I love you.

1168
01:55:37,919 --> 01:55:41,377
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1169
01:55:47,695 --> 01:55:51,131
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1170
01:55:55,203 --> 01:55:57,637
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1171
01:55:58,005 --> 01:55:59,336
Well, thank you.

1172
01:55:59,607 --> 01:56:02,371
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1173
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:04,043
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1174
01:56:04,478 --> 01:56:06,742
Brutal, you gonna hog all them taters?

1175
01:56:06,948 --> 01:56:09,508
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1176
01:56:09,717 --> 01:56:10,775
Come on, now.

1177
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:14,883
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1178
01:56:15,089 --> 01:56:17,455
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1179
01:56:20,294 --> 01:56:22,660
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1180
01:56:22,897 --> 01:56:24,660
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1181
01:56:25,132 --> 01:56:26,963
He did the same thing to me.

1182
01:56:27,335 --> 01:56:29,394
He put his hands on me.

1183
01:56:30,171 --> 01:56:32,298
He took my bladder infection away.

1184
01:56:37,178 --> 01:56:38,167
It's true.

1185
01:56:38,379 --> 01:56:40,711
When he came home that day, he was...

1186
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,649
...all better.

1187
01:56:45,152 --> 01:56:48,087
Now, wait.
You're talking about...

1188
01:56:48,289 --> 01:56:49,950
...an authentic healing?

1189
01:56:51,325 --> 01:56:52,656
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1190
01:56:53,394 --> 01:56:54,622
I am.

1191
01:56:57,031 --> 01:57:00,194
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1192
01:57:01,168 --> 01:57:03,136
What's it got to do with us?

1193
01:57:03,504 --> 01:57:04,971
You're thinking about Melinda.

1194
01:57:05,172 --> 01:57:06,605
Melinda?

1195
01:57:07,208 --> 01:57:08,038
Melinda Moores?

1196
01:57:08,376 --> 01:57:12,107
So, Paul, you really think
you can help her?

1197
01:57:12,713 --> 01:57:16,945
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1198
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:20,819
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1199
01:57:21,022 --> 01:57:25,789
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1200
01:57:25,993 --> 01:57:28,223
No, Hal would never stand for that.

1201
01:57:28,462 --> 01:57:31,056
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything, even if it fell on him.

1202
01:57:31,299 --> 01:57:32,891
So you're talking about...

1203
01:57:33,534 --> 01:57:35,525
...taking John Coffey to her.

1204
01:57:40,541 --> 01:57:43,135
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1205
01:57:44,145 --> 01:57:45,612
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1206
01:57:45,813 --> 01:57:48,839
-Dang right it is.
-No, not for you, Dean.

1207
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:52,144
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1208
01:57:52,386 --> 01:57:54,047
That way, you can deny everything.

1209
01:57:54,822 --> 01:57:56,312
Why do I have to stay behind?

1210
01:57:58,426 --> 01:58:00,360
Our boy's grown up...

1211
01:58:00,561 --> 01:58:01,858
...gone off to school.

1212
01:58:02,063 --> 01:58:04,588
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1213
01:58:04,999 --> 01:58:06,261
Brutal's a single man.

1214
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:09,867
You're the only one here with
two children, another on the way.

1215
01:58:10,237 --> 01:58:13,297
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1216
01:58:15,576 --> 01:58:18,238
Brutal, help me out here.

1217
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:21,411
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1218
01:58:21,615 --> 01:58:23,139
The finest.

1219
01:58:23,351 --> 01:58:25,512
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1220
01:58:25,753 --> 01:58:28,221
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1221
01:58:28,422 --> 01:58:30,185
I have no doubt.

1222
01:58:31,492 --> 01:58:33,551
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1223
01:58:33,761 --> 01:58:36,889
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1224
01:58:37,999 --> 01:58:40,194
Now, what if he escapes?

1225
01:58:40,434 --> 01:58:43,597
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1226
01:58:43,804 --> 01:58:47,103
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1227
01:58:47,308 --> 01:58:49,105
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1228
01:58:50,778 --> 01:58:52,143
In fact...

1229
01:58:54,782 --> 01:58:56,613
...I don't think he did it at all.

1230
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:03,486
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1231
01:59:03,691 --> 01:59:05,784
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1232
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:10,463
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1233
01:59:12,233 --> 01:59:13,325
And plus...

1234
01:59:13,801 --> 01:59:15,632
...he's huge.

1235
01:59:16,037 --> 01:59:20,940
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1236
01:59:21,142 --> 01:59:25,135
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1237
01:59:25,513 --> 01:59:26,775
I'd insist on that.

1238
01:59:28,082 --> 01:59:30,846
If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1239
01:59:31,519 --> 01:59:33,384
...we'd have to take him down.

1240
01:59:34,021 --> 01:59:35,010
You understand?

1241
01:59:46,867 --> 01:59:48,198
So...

1242
01:59:48,936 --> 01:59:50,767
...tell us what you had in mind.

1243
01:59:58,012 --> 01:59:59,070
There it is.

1244
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:00,747
I see it.

1245
02:00:11,425 --> 02:00:13,416
You think this is enough?

1246
02:00:14,595 --> 02:00:16,187
I don't know.

1247
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,492
You fellas thirsty?

1248
02:00:54,902 --> 02:00:56,392
Fresh out of the icebox.

1249
02:00:56,604 --> 02:00:58,265
You bet. That's swell, Brutal.

1250
02:00:58,506 --> 02:01:00,269
-Thanks.
-Oh, yeah.

1251
02:01:00,474 --> 02:01:01,498
Hot in here.

1252
02:01:01,709 --> 02:01:02,698
Boy, howdy.

1253
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:06,141
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't I?

1254
02:01:06,347 --> 02:01:09,783
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1255
02:01:10,417 --> 02:01:12,510
Because I got a big pecker.

1256
02:01:12,753 --> 02:01:15,517
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1257
02:01:16,023 --> 02:01:18,617
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1258
02:01:18,959 --> 02:01:20,449
Don't be stingy hogs.

1259
02:01:23,664 --> 02:01:25,097
Come on.

1260
02:01:26,233 --> 02:01:28,258
Come on now, fellers.

1261
02:01:29,403 --> 02:01:30,631
Come on, boss.

1262
02:01:30,871 --> 02:01:32,702
I been good all day.

1263
02:01:35,943 --> 02:01:37,638
It's hot in here.

1264
02:01:37,878 --> 02:01:41,370
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1265
02:01:41,582 --> 02:01:43,482
Why don't you give me some?

1266
02:01:50,224 --> 02:01:51,521
Come on.

1267
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:58,359
You gonna stay behaved?

1268
02:01:58,799 --> 02:02:00,164
Come on, you clunk, give me that.

1269
02:02:00,401 --> 02:02:02,062
You promise me...

1270
02:02:02,469 --> 02:02:04,664
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1271
02:02:05,139 --> 02:02:07,607
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

1272
02:02:08,142 --> 02:02:09,632
I'll be good.

1273
02:02:34,535 --> 02:02:35,524
Cup.

1274
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,845
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1275
02:03:29,556 --> 02:03:31,353
After this, there's no turning back.

1276
02:03:32,893 --> 02:03:34,053
So?

1277
02:03:34,928 --> 02:03:36,122
We gonna do this?

1278
02:03:36,630 --> 02:03:39,622
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1279
02:03:39,833 --> 02:03:42,063
I'd like to take a ride.

1280
02:03:47,308 --> 02:03:49,333
Guess we're all in.

1281
02:04:00,421 --> 02:04:01,683
What is this?

1282
02:04:04,158 --> 02:04:05,125
Payback.

1283
02:04:05,326 --> 02:04:06,918
That's right.

1284
02:04:11,598 --> 02:04:14,465
-No, you let me go! Let go of me!
-Settle down.

1285
02:04:14,668 --> 02:04:15,635
-Let go!
-Settle down.

1286
02:04:15,836 --> 02:04:17,133
What are you doing?

1287
02:04:17,338 --> 02:04:18,270
Settle down.

1288
02:04:26,447 --> 02:04:28,278
''Miss Lotta Leadpipe.''

1289
02:04:29,383 --> 02:04:32,648
-What would your mother say?
-You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1290
02:04:32,853 --> 02:04:35,583
I know people. Big people!

1291
02:04:35,989 --> 02:04:39,083
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1292
02:04:39,293 --> 02:04:41,261
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1293
02:04:41,462 --> 02:04:44,124
You're dead wrong about that, you know.

1294
02:04:49,803 --> 02:04:52,067
You gonna put your arms up?

1295
02:04:52,906 --> 02:04:56,069
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1296
02:04:58,212 --> 02:04:59,873
There you go.

1297
02:05:08,088 --> 02:05:09,521
Please, Paul.

1298
02:05:09,723 --> 02:05:13,523
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1299
02:05:14,762 --> 02:05:16,696
You would think that.

1300
02:05:18,332 --> 02:05:20,800
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1301
02:05:21,001 --> 02:05:23,435
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1302
02:05:23,637 --> 02:05:26,037
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1303
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:29,368
We can and we are.

1304
02:05:36,116 --> 02:05:40,746
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1305
02:05:40,954 --> 02:05:44,617
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1306
02:05:53,534 --> 02:05:55,627
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1307
02:05:55,869 --> 02:05:58,030
What do you say if somebody stops by?

1308
02:05:59,807 --> 02:06:01,638
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1309
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:05,106
...so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1310
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:07,212
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1311
02:06:07,414 --> 02:06:08,403
What about me?

1312
02:06:08,615 --> 02:06:11,243
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1313
02:06:11,452 --> 02:06:14,580
...on account of how big a screw-up
the execution was.

1314
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:18,585
We going for the ride now?

1315
02:06:18,826 --> 02:06:21,454
That's right. We going for the ride.

1316
02:06:23,597 --> 02:06:24,996
What about us, Dean?

1317
02:06:25,232 --> 02:06:29,066
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1318
02:06:29,269 --> 02:06:31,897
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1319
02:06:35,242 --> 02:06:37,369
Where you think you going?

1320
02:06:43,951 --> 02:06:45,282
You a bad man.

1321
02:06:45,519 --> 02:06:47,885
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1322
02:06:55,662 --> 02:06:57,562
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1323
02:06:57,865 --> 02:06:59,298
What's wrong?

1324
02:07:23,223 --> 02:07:26,386
Whole room, whole room's spinning.

1325
02:07:26,593 --> 02:07:28,857
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1326
02:07:29,062 --> 02:07:31,462
Had me some shine or...

1327
02:07:32,165 --> 02:07:33,530
...or what?

1328
02:07:35,802 --> 02:07:38,532
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1329
02:07:38,739 --> 02:07:40,366
White man...

1330
02:07:40,574 --> 02:07:45,170
...ought not to sit in no nigger
electric chair. No, sir.

1331
02:07:52,319 --> 02:07:55,049
He a bad man.

1332
02:08:14,675 --> 02:08:15,801
Look, boss.

1333
02:08:20,347 --> 02:08:23,009
It's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1334
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:25,547
John, we have to be quiet now.

1335
02:08:26,086 --> 02:08:28,520
You see her? You see the lady?

1336
02:08:28,722 --> 02:08:30,781
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1337
02:08:42,202 --> 02:08:44,136
Let's go. Go, go!

1338
02:08:48,542 --> 02:08:49,702
Now!

1339
02:09:25,746 --> 02:09:27,771
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

1340
02:10:02,416 --> 02:10:03,849
Upsy-daisy.

1341
02:10:13,627 --> 02:10:15,788
Do you know where we're taking you?

1342
02:10:19,132 --> 02:10:20,326
Help a lady?

1343
02:10:22,302 --> 02:10:23,792
That's right.

1344
02:10:24,638 --> 02:10:25,798
How do you know?

1345
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:28,972
Don't know.

1346
02:10:30,877 --> 02:10:35,473
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1347
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:37,978
I never have.

1348
02:11:13,286 --> 02:11:15,277
We can still turn back.

1349
02:11:17,224 --> 02:11:18,316
Boss, look.

1350
02:11:18,725 --> 02:11:20,454
Someone's up.

1351
02:11:21,995 --> 02:11:23,826
This was a mistake.

1352
02:11:24,231 --> 02:11:26,028
Christ, what were we thinking?

1353
02:11:26,233 --> 02:11:29,498
It's too late now. John, you stay.

1354
02:11:33,974 --> 02:11:36,966
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1355
02:11:47,187 --> 02:11:49,883
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1356
02:11:50,090 --> 02:11:52,388
It's us. It's Paul and Brutal.

1357
02:11:52,592 --> 02:11:54,025
-It's us.
-Jesus.

1358
02:11:54,227 --> 02:11:56,388
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1359
02:11:56,596 --> 02:12:00,054
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1360
02:12:00,333 --> 02:12:01,357
Are you hostages?

1361
02:12:02,669 --> 02:12:04,034
Who's out there?

1362
02:12:04,437 --> 02:12:06,405
-Who's by that truck?
-Harry, the lights!

1363
02:12:10,844 --> 02:12:12,675
John Coffey.

1364
02:12:13,246 --> 02:12:14,235
Halt!

1365
02:12:14,447 --> 02:12:16,745
-Stay where you are!
-Take it easy, now.

1366
02:12:17,083 --> 02:12:18,983
-Don't you move!
-Wait!

1367
02:12:19,186 --> 02:12:20,483
I'm warning you.

1368
02:12:20,687 --> 02:12:22,211
Halt or I'll shoot!

1369
02:12:22,455 --> 02:12:24,446
-I said halt!
-Hal, put the gun down!

1370
02:12:30,096 --> 02:12:32,621
Who are you talking to down there?

1371
02:12:32,899 --> 02:12:33,888
Goddamn it!

1372
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:38,503
Now, nobody is hurt.
And we are here to help.

1373
02:12:38,705 --> 02:12:41,902
Help what? I don't understand.

1374
02:12:42,142 --> 02:12:44,975
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1375
02:13:01,561 --> 02:13:03,051
What do you want?

1376
02:13:05,665 --> 02:13:07,656
Make them go away!

1377
02:13:08,635 --> 02:13:12,435
I don't want no salesmen...

1378
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:14,402
...in the middle of the night.

1379
02:13:14,975 --> 02:13:18,706
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling....

1380
02:13:18,912 --> 02:13:20,311
Just to help.

1381
02:13:21,014 --> 02:13:23,847
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1382
02:13:24,451 --> 02:13:27,750
You can't. No one can.

1383
02:13:39,099 --> 02:13:41,533
-Stay out of here!
-Don't you go in there!

1384
02:13:41,768 --> 02:13:44,703
-Whoever you are, just stay out!
-Don't you do it!

1385
02:13:45,272 --> 02:13:47,934
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1386
02:13:49,609 --> 02:13:52,134
You stop now. You hear me?

1387
02:13:52,779 --> 02:13:55,509
-Paul, I don't want him up there.
-Boss...

1388
02:13:55,782 --> 02:13:57,943
...you just be quiet now.

1389
02:14:45,699 --> 02:14:48,099
It's all right, Hal. It's all right.

1390
02:14:48,335 --> 02:14:50,826
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1391
02:14:57,043 --> 02:14:59,603
Don't come near me, pig-fucker.

1392
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:15,758
Why do you have so many scars?

1393
02:15:18,631 --> 02:15:20,895
Who hurt you so badly?

1394
02:15:22,469 --> 02:15:24,801
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1395
02:15:27,307 --> 02:15:29,138
What's your name?

1396
02:15:29,709 --> 02:15:32,940
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1397
02:15:33,213 --> 02:15:35,579
...only not spelt the same.

1398
02:15:42,222 --> 02:15:43,314
Ma'am?

1399
02:15:51,331 --> 02:15:53,265
Yes, John Coffey?

1400
02:15:55,001 --> 02:15:56,559
I see it.

1401
02:15:57,237 --> 02:15:58,397
I see it.

1402
02:16:05,578 --> 02:16:08,240
What's happening?

1403
02:16:09,516 --> 02:16:13,748
You be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1404
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,874
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1405
02:17:43,209 --> 02:17:45,439
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1406
02:17:47,013 --> 02:17:50,779
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1407
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:56,614
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1408
02:18:10,370 --> 02:18:11,632
How did I get here?

1409
02:18:16,075 --> 02:18:19,135
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1410
02:18:19,412 --> 02:18:20,709
Remember?

1411
02:18:22,048 --> 02:18:23,310
Melly...

1412
02:18:23,816 --> 02:18:25,647
...it doesn't matter.

1413
02:18:26,386 --> 02:18:27,876
It doesn't matter anymore.

1414
02:18:28,087 --> 02:18:30,715
Did I have the x-ray?

1415
02:18:31,391 --> 02:18:32,881
Did I?

1416
02:18:35,595 --> 02:18:36,823
Yes.

1417
02:18:37,730 --> 02:18:41,723
Yes. It was clear.
There was no tumor.

1418
02:18:59,352 --> 02:19:00,683
Can you stand up?

1419
02:19:00,887 --> 02:19:02,946
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1420
02:19:15,435 --> 02:19:17,027
What's your name?

1421
02:19:18,304 --> 02:19:20,465
John Coffey, ma'am.

1422
02:19:21,941 --> 02:19:23,602
Like the drink.

1423
02:19:25,044 --> 02:19:27,137
Only not spelt the same.

1424
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:31,211
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1425
02:19:36,022 --> 02:19:37,455
No, you can't.

1426
02:20:02,148 --> 02:20:04,241
I dreamed of you.

1427
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:09,921
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1428
02:20:11,424 --> 02:20:13,324
And so was I.

1429
02:20:15,161 --> 02:20:17,322
And we found each other.

1430
02:20:18,264 --> 02:20:20,858
We found each other in the dark.

1431
02:20:40,420 --> 02:20:42,115
Take it, John. It's a present.

1432
02:20:42,522 --> 02:20:44,615
It's St. Christopher.

1433
02:20:45,858 --> 02:20:48,053
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1434
02:20:48,895 --> 02:20:51,386
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1435
02:20:51,798 --> 02:20:53,288
Please.

1436
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,361
Wear it for me.

1437
02:21:09,949 --> 02:21:11,746
Thank you, ma'am.

1438
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:15,651
Thank you, John.

1439
02:21:22,328 --> 02:21:27,163
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1440
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:31,166
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1441
02:21:46,853 --> 02:21:49,913
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1442
02:21:50,256 --> 02:21:52,417
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1443
02:21:53,259 --> 02:21:55,420
I give him a few days.

1444
02:21:55,695 --> 02:21:59,153
One of us will do a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1445
02:21:59,365 --> 02:22:02,061
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1446
02:22:02,268 --> 02:22:04,532
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1447
02:22:18,384 --> 02:22:20,944
Am I happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1448
02:22:21,154 --> 02:22:23,247
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1449
02:22:23,456 --> 02:22:24,480
What happened to him?

1450
02:22:24,891 --> 02:22:27,985
He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1451
02:22:31,431 --> 02:22:32,955
Okay, John.

1452
02:22:34,834 --> 02:22:38,463
We're gonna set you down
on your bed now. Here we go.

1453
02:22:56,489 --> 02:22:57,649
Well?

1454
02:22:59,492 --> 02:23:01,357
What about Mrs. Moores?

1455
02:23:03,429 --> 02:23:05,363
Was it like the mouse?

1456
02:23:06,666 --> 02:23:07,758
Was it...

1457
02:23:09,836 --> 02:23:12,771
...you know, a miracle?

1458
02:23:15,508 --> 02:23:17,669
Yes, it was.

1459
02:23:18,211 --> 02:23:19,337
Damn!

1460
02:23:35,094 --> 02:23:36,288
Now...

1461
02:23:36,863 --> 02:23:39,559
...I want to talk, not shout.

1462
02:23:39,799 --> 02:23:43,132
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1463
02:23:45,304 --> 02:23:48,467
My mama always said you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1464
02:23:52,245 --> 02:23:53,974
Guess she was wrong.

1465
02:23:57,216 --> 02:23:58,774
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1466
02:23:58,985 --> 02:24:00,316
-In a minute.
-Now!

1467
02:24:00,553 --> 02:24:02,282
Right now! I want out now!

1468
02:24:06,826 --> 02:24:08,817
Shut up and listen.

1469
02:24:09,562 --> 02:24:13,498
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1470
02:24:14,233 --> 02:24:16,724
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

1471
02:24:17,169 --> 02:24:21,663
We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

1472
02:24:21,874 --> 02:24:26,072
...and pissed yourself like a frightened
little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1473
02:24:27,246 --> 02:24:28,736
But, Percy...

1474
02:24:29,415 --> 02:24:31,406
...you mind me now.

1475
02:24:31,851 --> 02:24:35,912
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1476
02:24:37,423 --> 02:24:38,685
We know people too.

1477
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:42,456
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1478
02:24:45,031 --> 02:24:48,091
Let bygones be bygones.

1479
02:24:49,101 --> 02:24:51,763
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1480
02:24:52,204 --> 02:24:56,368
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1481
02:24:56,776 --> 02:25:00,268
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1482
02:25:01,314 --> 02:25:02,713
Always has.

1483
02:25:11,891 --> 02:25:14,382
May I be let out of this coat now?

1484
02:25:34,313 --> 02:25:35,473
My things?

1485
02:25:38,584 --> 02:25:40,643
Think it over, Percy.

1486
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:43,251
I intend to.

1487
02:25:44,156 --> 02:25:47,250
I intend to think it over very hard.

1488
02:25:48,995 --> 02:25:50,485
Starting right now.

1489
02:26:00,539 --> 02:26:03,872
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1490
02:26:18,290 --> 02:26:20,485
-Hey, let him go!
-John, let go!

1491
02:26:20,693 --> 02:26:21,717
Let go, John!

1492
02:26:21,961 --> 02:26:23,826
John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1493
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:24,894
Let go, John! No!

1494
02:26:26,832 --> 02:26:27,799
Back off!

1495
02:26:28,634 --> 02:26:30,192
John, stop it!

1496
02:26:30,936 --> 02:26:32,301
Let him go! Back off!

1497
02:26:32,505 --> 02:26:33,529
John, let him go!

1498
02:26:49,455 --> 02:26:51,116
Oh, my God!

1499
02:27:34,533 --> 02:27:37,263
Easy, now. Easy.

1500
02:27:38,537 --> 02:27:39,936
Easy.

1501
02:27:50,549 --> 02:27:51,982
Are you all right?

1502
02:28:24,750 --> 02:28:26,809
Boy, what you looking at?

1503
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:38,357
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1504
02:28:38,664 --> 02:28:42,862
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1505
02:29:04,256 --> 02:29:06,520
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1506
02:30:08,854 --> 02:30:11,414
I punished them bad men.

1507
02:30:11,957 --> 02:30:13,686
I punished them both.

1508
02:30:13,926 --> 02:30:15,188
Why?

1509
02:30:16,095 --> 02:30:17,357
Why Wild Bill?

1510
02:30:18,697 --> 02:30:22,997
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1511
02:30:23,936 --> 02:30:25,836
I saw what Wild Billy'd done.

1512
02:30:26,438 --> 02:30:28,838
Saw it plain as day.

1513
02:30:29,942 --> 02:30:32,809
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1514
02:30:33,112 --> 02:30:34,272
What?

1515
02:30:36,115 --> 02:30:37,275
You saw what?

1516
02:30:41,153 --> 02:30:43,280
Take my hand, boss.

1517
02:30:46,425 --> 02:30:48,188
You see for yourself.

1518
02:30:51,864 --> 02:30:52,956
No.

1519
02:30:57,002 --> 02:30:58,401
Please.

1520
02:31:06,812 --> 02:31:08,473
No, no.

1521
02:31:09,448 --> 02:31:10,278
Please.

1522
02:31:10,482 --> 02:31:15,146
I gots to, boss. I gots to
give you a little bit of myself.

1523
02:31:16,889 --> 02:31:18,322
A gift.

1524
02:31:19,658 --> 02:31:23,890
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1525
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:23,085
Suppertime!

1526
02:32:23,455 --> 02:32:25,320
Bring the girls!

1527
02:32:28,794 --> 02:32:31,729
Girls! You heard your mama!

1528
02:32:32,598 --> 02:32:35,328
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1529
02:32:53,685 --> 02:32:57,246
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1530
02:32:57,589 --> 02:32:59,318
Come get you some supper.

1531
02:33:02,261 --> 02:33:06,459
God is great, God is good,
and we thank You....

1532
02:33:30,856 --> 02:33:35,589
You love your sister? You make
any noise, you know what happens?

1533
02:33:35,794 --> 02:33:37,887
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1534
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:41,622
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1535
02:33:41,834 --> 02:33:43,461
You understand?

1536
02:34:01,987 --> 02:34:05,980
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1537
02:34:07,226 --> 02:34:09,558
Now you see how it is.

1538
02:34:10,863 --> 02:34:13,764
That's the way it is every day.

1539
02:34:13,999 --> 02:34:18,163
That's the way it is all over the world.

1540
02:34:28,413 --> 02:34:29,380
Percy.

1541
02:34:29,615 --> 02:34:30,912
Percy Wetmore.

1542
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:32,839
Son?

1543
02:34:35,888 --> 02:34:37,185
Son?

1544
02:34:37,856 --> 02:34:40,848
-Son, can you hear me?
-Speak up if you can hear us.

1545
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:44,920
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1546
02:34:46,698 --> 02:34:49,633
Percy, I got to ask you
a few questions.

1547
02:34:49,868 --> 02:34:53,133
One minute, he was fine,
and the next, blammo!

1548
02:34:53,372 --> 02:34:55,772
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1549
02:34:55,974 --> 02:34:58,204
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1550
02:34:59,545 --> 02:35:02,446
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1551
02:35:06,385 --> 02:35:09,718
I'll cover for you as much as I can...

1552
02:35:09,922 --> 02:35:12,220
...even if it means my job.

1553
02:35:12,891 --> 02:35:14,722
But I have to know...

1554
02:35:15,127 --> 02:35:18,324
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1555
02:35:21,233 --> 02:35:22,757
Does it, Paul?

1556
02:35:24,670 --> 02:35:25,932
No.

1557
02:36:53,358 --> 02:36:57,158
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1558
02:36:58,430 --> 02:37:00,159
Well, can he help?

1559
02:37:00,732 --> 02:37:03,530
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1560
02:37:03,735 --> 02:37:05,259
Stop the execution?

1561
02:37:05,504 --> 02:37:06,493
No.

1562
02:37:09,675 --> 02:37:11,165
Then don't tell him.

1563
02:37:11,843 --> 02:37:14,107
If it can't help, don't tell him.

1564
02:37:14,446 --> 02:37:15,708
Ever.

1565
02:37:18,050 --> 02:37:19,517
I won't.

1566
02:37:31,229 --> 02:37:33,595
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1567
02:37:35,067 --> 02:37:36,432
No.

1568
02:37:37,469 --> 02:37:40,029
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1569
02:37:40,238 --> 02:37:43,571
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways.

1570
02:37:45,977 --> 02:37:48,104
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1571
02:37:49,648 --> 02:37:54,483
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of...

1572
02:37:55,053 --> 02:37:59,922
...but this is the first time I've
ever felt real danger of hell.

1573
02:38:00,926 --> 02:38:02,291
Hell?

1574
02:38:08,166 --> 02:38:09,793
Talk to him.

1575
02:38:10,969 --> 02:38:12,800
Talk to John.

1576
02:38:14,573 --> 02:38:16,598
Find out what he wants.

1577
02:38:33,525 --> 02:38:34,753
Hello, boss.

1578
02:38:35,761 --> 02:38:37,092
Hello, John.

1579
02:38:38,530 --> 02:38:40,930
I guess you know we're
coming down to it now.

1580
02:38:41,700 --> 02:38:43,429
Another couple of days.

1581
02:38:56,982 --> 02:38:59,780
Is there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1582
02:39:00,185 --> 02:39:02,483
We can rustle you up most anything.

1583
02:39:12,798 --> 02:39:17,462
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1584
02:39:17,736 --> 02:39:19,135
Okra.

1585
02:39:20,238 --> 02:39:23,071
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1586
02:39:23,909 --> 02:39:25,968
...if she don't mind.

1587
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:29,679
Now...

1588
02:39:30,215 --> 02:39:35,118
...what about a preacher?
Somebody to say a little prayer with.

1589
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:37,481
Don't want no preacher.

1590
02:39:38,523 --> 02:39:41,048
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1591
02:39:41,693 --> 02:39:42,819
Me?

1592
02:39:45,831 --> 02:39:48,664
Suppose I could, if it came to that.

1593
02:39:56,875 --> 02:39:59,673
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1594
02:40:01,346 --> 02:40:03,541
I know what you gonna say.

1595
02:40:04,015 --> 02:40:05,505
You don't have to say it.

1596
02:40:05,851 --> 02:40:09,184
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1597
02:40:13,124 --> 02:40:15,456
Tell me what you want me to do.

1598
02:40:16,361 --> 02:40:18,352
You want me to take you out of here?

1599
02:40:19,598 --> 02:40:23,591
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1600
02:40:25,070 --> 02:40:27,766
Why would you do such a foolish thing?

1601
02:40:29,774 --> 02:40:31,901
On the day of my judgment...

1602
02:40:32,711 --> 02:40:34,906
...when I stand before God...

1603
02:40:35,113 --> 02:40:38,947
...and He asks me why did I...

1604
02:40:39,150 --> 02:40:41,778
...did I kill one of His true...

1605
02:40:42,654 --> 02:40:44,212
...miracles...

1606
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:47,551
...what am I going to say?

1607
02:40:48,493 --> 02:40:50,222
That it was my job?

1608
02:40:52,397 --> 02:40:54,388
It's my job.

1609
02:40:54,699 --> 02:40:59,329
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1610
02:41:02,474 --> 02:41:05,068
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1611
02:41:05,744 --> 02:41:09,407
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1612
02:41:10,582 --> 02:41:13,574
I want it to be over and done with.

1613
02:41:14,252 --> 02:41:15,742
I do.

1614
02:41:20,191 --> 02:41:22,182
I'm tired, boss.

1615
02:41:23,595 --> 02:41:27,964
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1616
02:41:29,167 --> 02:41:31,931
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1617
02:41:32,504 --> 02:41:37,100
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1618
02:41:37,943 --> 02:41:42,175
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1619
02:41:43,281 --> 02:41:47,240
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1620
02:41:47,452 --> 02:41:49,113
...every day.

1621
02:41:49,487 --> 02:41:51,455
There's too much of it.

1622
02:41:51,790 --> 02:41:55,624
It's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1623
02:41:55,827 --> 02:41:58,125
...all the time.

1624
02:41:59,631 --> 02:42:01,690
Can you understand?

1625
02:42:04,636 --> 02:42:07,605
Yes, John, I think I can.

1626
02:42:09,975 --> 02:42:13,376
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1627
02:42:15,547 --> 02:42:17,572
There must be something that you want.

1628
02:42:26,992 --> 02:42:31,486
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1629
02:42:31,997 --> 02:42:34,124
Heaven

1630
02:42:34,332 --> 02:42:36,493
I'm in heaven

1631
02:42:37,402 --> 02:42:42,237
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

1632
02:42:44,075 --> 02:42:48,910
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek

1633
02:42:50,515 --> 02:42:55,350
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1634
02:43:57,415 --> 02:43:59,849
Why, they's angels.

1635
02:44:00,752 --> 02:44:03,414
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1636
02:45:04,082 --> 02:45:06,073
I'll be all right, fellas.

1637
02:45:07,485 --> 02:45:09,749
This here's the hard part.

1638
02:45:11,055 --> 02:45:12,579
I'll be all right in a while.

1639
02:45:15,393 --> 02:45:18,260
I should have this just for now.

1640
02:45:22,267 --> 02:45:24,701
I'll give it back after.

1641
02:45:27,772 --> 02:45:32,368
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1642
02:45:33,578 --> 02:45:35,671
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1643
02:45:36,848 --> 02:45:38,076
Did you, John?

1644
02:45:38,850 --> 02:45:43,253
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1645
02:45:43,454 --> 02:45:45,752
That Mouseville place.

1646
02:45:46,024 --> 02:45:48,356
I dreamed there's kids.

1647
02:45:48,927 --> 02:45:52,363
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1648
02:45:54,866 --> 02:45:58,666
I dreamed that those two little
blonde-headed girls was there.

1649
02:45:58,870 --> 02:46:00,735
They's laughing too.

1650
02:46:00,939 --> 02:46:03,874
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1651
02:46:04,075 --> 02:46:08,136
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1652
02:46:08,379 --> 02:46:11,712
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1653
02:46:13,218 --> 02:46:16,654
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1654
02:46:34,906 --> 02:46:38,967
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1655
02:46:40,912 --> 02:46:42,971
I can feel it.

1656
02:46:43,181 --> 02:46:44,910
It's like bees stinging me.

1657
02:46:45,250 --> 02:46:47,616
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1658
02:46:48,920 --> 02:46:50,080
We don't hate you.

1659
02:46:51,522 --> 02:46:53,080
Can you feel that?

1660
02:46:55,326 --> 02:46:57,487
IKill him twice, you boys!

1661
02:46:58,263 --> 02:47:02,256
You go on and kill that raping
babykiller twice!

1662
02:47:02,467 --> 02:47:04,298
That'd be fine!

1663
02:47:20,985 --> 02:47:23,453
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1664
02:47:23,655 --> 02:47:24,952
Yes, sir.

1665
02:47:37,235 --> 02:47:38,293
Roll on one.

1666
02:47:46,311 --> 02:47:49,838
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1667
02:47:50,648 --> 02:47:52,912
I hope it hurts like hell.

1668
02:47:54,886 --> 02:47:57,446
John Coffey, you've been condemned
to die in the electric chair...

1669
02:47:57,655 --> 02:47:58,917
...by a jury of your peers.

1670
02:47:59,157 --> 02:48:02,558
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1671
02:48:03,027 --> 02:48:06,258
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1672
02:48:07,999 --> 02:48:10,524
I'm sorry for what I am.

1673
02:48:22,547 --> 02:48:24,276
Please, boss...

1674
02:48:25,683 --> 02:48:28,379
...don't put that thing over my face.

1675
02:48:29,587 --> 02:48:31,919
Don't put me in the dark.

1676
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:35,022
I's afraid of the dark.

1677
02:48:44,702 --> 02:48:46,363
All right, John.

1678
02:49:06,557 --> 02:49:09,583
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1679
02:49:09,794 --> 02:49:12,627
Heaven, heaven

1680
02:49:12,830 --> 02:49:14,661
I'm in heaven

1681
02:49:15,233 --> 02:49:17,827
Heaven, heaven

1682
02:49:18,069 --> 02:49:19,764
I'm in heaven

1683
02:49:40,691 --> 02:49:42,283
John Coffey...

1684
02:49:43,327 --> 02:49:46,455
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1685
02:49:46,664 --> 02:49:48,825
...in accordance with state law.

1686
02:49:51,202 --> 02:49:54,933
May God have mercy on your soul.

1687
02:50:33,644 --> 02:50:35,578
You have to say it.

1688
02:50:37,248 --> 02:50:39,546
You have to give the order.

1689
02:50:57,568 --> 02:50:59,866
He killed them with they love.

1690
02:51:00,071 --> 02:51:04,906
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1691
02:51:18,689 --> 02:51:20,122
Roll on two.

1692
02:53:04,795 --> 02:53:08,162
It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1693
02:53:08,466 --> 02:53:12,197
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1694
02:53:13,371 --> 02:53:18,070
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1695
02:53:18,309 --> 02:53:20,072
It was all right.

1696
02:53:20,711 --> 02:53:23,646
''Catch them young'' became my motto.

1697
02:53:26,884 --> 02:53:28,010
You don't believe me.

1698
02:53:28,886 --> 02:53:31,411
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1699
02:53:32,223 --> 02:53:34,384
-It's just that--
-It's quite a story.

1700
02:53:34,592 --> 02:53:36,822
It's quite a story.

1701
02:53:37,228 --> 02:53:39,594
One thing I don't understand.

1702
02:53:39,830 --> 02:53:41,593
You said you and Jan...

1703
02:53:41,832 --> 02:53:45,393
...had a grown son in 1 935.

1704
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:47,160
Is that right?

1705
02:53:47,538 --> 02:53:49,506
The math doesn't work, does it?

1706
02:53:55,179 --> 02:53:57,773
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1707
02:54:18,436 --> 02:54:19,869
Watch your step.

1708
02:54:20,371 --> 02:54:22,703
Now let your eyes adjust.

1709
02:54:34,552 --> 02:54:35,576
There.

1710
02:54:39,390 --> 02:54:41,119
Wake up, old fella.

1711
02:54:41,392 --> 02:54:42,654
Wake up.

1712
02:54:46,230 --> 02:54:50,098
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1713
02:54:54,305 --> 02:54:55,636
Come over here, boy.

1714
02:54:56,140 --> 02:54:58,506
Come on over here and see this lady.

1715
02:55:01,412 --> 02:55:04,438
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1716
02:55:27,104 --> 02:55:29,698
Go on, you can do it.

1717
02:55:36,781 --> 02:55:41,275
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1718
02:55:42,052 --> 02:55:46,011
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1719
02:55:52,463 --> 02:55:56,126
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1720
02:55:56,567 --> 02:56:01,436
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1721
02:56:01,639 --> 02:56:04,039
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1722
02:56:04,241 --> 02:56:07,642
And I think a part of...

1723
02:56:07,878 --> 02:56:10,540
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1724
02:56:10,815 --> 02:56:14,148
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1725
02:56:15,319 --> 02:56:17,310
As for me...

1726
02:56:18,489 --> 02:56:21,049
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1727
02:56:21,325 --> 02:56:23,486
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1728
02:56:23,828 --> 02:56:27,264
...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1729
02:56:29,667 --> 02:56:31,897
When John did that...

1730
02:56:33,337 --> 02:56:35,669
...when he took my hand...

1731
02:56:36,674 --> 02:56:40,576
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1732
02:56:41,512 --> 02:56:43,377
...spilled into me.

1733
02:56:43,747 --> 02:56:45,578
He...what?

1734
02:56:46,016 --> 02:56:49,543
He infected you with life?

1735
02:56:51,121 --> 02:56:53,453
It's as good a word as any.

1736
02:56:54,959 --> 02:56:57,860
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1737
02:56:58,062 --> 02:56:59,529
With life.

1738
02:57:03,601 --> 02:57:06,695
I'm 1 08 years old, Elaine.

1739
02:57:06,937 --> 02:57:11,306
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1740
02:57:14,211 --> 02:57:17,977
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1741
02:57:18,215 --> 02:57:22,777
He was just a force of nature.

1742
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:27,418
I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1743
02:57:28,459 --> 02:57:31,428
Another century come to pass.

1744
02:57:34,164 --> 02:57:38,624
But I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1745
02:57:39,003 --> 02:57:41,062
Hal and Melinda...

1746
02:57:41,505 --> 02:57:42,938
...Brutus Howell...

1747
02:57:43,140 --> 02:57:45,802
...my wife, my boy.

1748
02:57:48,746 --> 02:57:50,611
And you, Elaine.

1749
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:53,412
You'll die too.

1750
02:57:54,919 --> 02:57:59,322
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1751
02:58:00,758 --> 02:58:03,192
It's my atonement, you see.

1752
02:58:03,761 --> 02:58:05,490
It's my punishment...

1753
02:58:05,696 --> 02:58:08,324
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1754
02:58:10,034 --> 02:58:12,798
For killing a miracle of God.

1755
02:58:14,338 --> 02:58:17,102
Almighty, everlasting God...

1756
02:58:17,408 --> 02:58:19,808
...the source of all being and life.

1757
02:58:20,010 --> 02:58:24,344
You'll be gone like all the others.
I'll have to stay.

1758
02:58:26,350 --> 02:58:30,548
I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1759
02:58:31,288 --> 02:58:35,281
I have no illusions of immortality.

1760
02:58:35,659 --> 02:58:38,150
But I will have wished for death...

1761
02:58:38,862 --> 02:58:41,057
...long before death finds me.

1762
02:58:42,166 --> 02:58:46,000
In truth, I wish for it already.

1763
02:58:58,082 --> 02:59:00,073
Mr. Jingles?

1764
02:59:09,059 --> 02:59:11,220
Where you been?

1765
02:59:11,662 --> 02:59:14,927
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1766
02:59:15,766 --> 02:59:18,200
Let's see if we can find you
something to eat.

1767
02:59:19,336 --> 02:59:23,067
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1768
02:59:24,508 --> 02:59:25,839
Look at you.

1769
02:59:27,544 --> 02:59:31,446
I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1770
02:59:31,649 --> 02:59:33,674
And I wait.

1771
02:59:34,585 --> 02:59:37,315
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1772
02:59:37,521 --> 02:59:39,682
...now long gone.

1773
02:59:40,424 --> 02:59:42,858
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1774
02:59:43,060 --> 02:59:46,086
...how I lost her so many years ago.

1775
02:59:47,464 --> 02:59:52,094
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1776
02:59:52,302 --> 02:59:54,964
...each in our own time.

1777
02:59:56,040 --> 02:59:59,237
But one thought
more than any other...

1778
02:59:59,443 --> 03:00:02,071
...keeps me awake most nights:

1779
03:00:03,247 --> 03:00:07,206
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1780
03:00:07,718 --> 03:00:10,778
...how much longer do I have?

1781
03:00:14,091 --> 03:00:16,855
We each owe a death.

1782
03:00:17,061 --> 03:00:19,552
There are no exceptions.

1783
03:00:20,330 --> 03:00:22,321
But, oh, God...

1784
03:00:23,233 --> 03:00:25,030
...sometimes...

1785
03:00:25,636 --> 03:00:29,231
...the Green Mile seems so long.
