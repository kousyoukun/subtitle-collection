1
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:59,090
Katie!

2
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:01,259
Cora!

3
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,037
You love your sister?

4
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:05,806
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:53,787
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:57,684
- How am I looking, Paul?
- That's better. That's better.

7
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,408
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,038
Some Danish?

9
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:20,407
No, just two pieces of
dry toast, Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,014
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,343
Dry and cold, same as always.

12
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,618
Cold is better.

13
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,152
Especially on those long walks.

14
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,726
Am I right?

15
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,796
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

16
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:39,091
We're not supposed to
let you wander off.

17
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:46,302
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

18
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,400
Just walk.

19
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,510
I like to walk.

20
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,047
Try not to fall down, bust a hip.

21
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:58,082
I don't wanna be in no
damn search party.

22
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:12,289
You want this man in your life?
Explain the moral basis of that.

23
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,493
I've made mistakes.

24
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:16,696
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

25
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,935
You can't ask nothing.
I have six kids myself.

26
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,735
Why do we always watch this stuff?

27
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,972
It's interesting.

28
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:31,342
Interesting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

29
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:34,082
All they ever talk about is fucking.

30
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,003
Are you all right?

31
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,708
You look tired. You're not yourself.

32
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,605
No, I'm fine. I promise.

33
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,709
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

34
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:10,849
Not that you asked me.

35
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,983
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

36
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,321
I had a few bad dreams. It happens.

37
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,186
I'll be fine.

38
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,295
If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

39
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:32,631
Neither do I.

40
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,476
Now, this here is worth a look.

41
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,244
I'm in heaven

42
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:45,419
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

43
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:48,787
And I seem to find

44
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:52,687
The happiness I seek

45
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:56,163
When we're out together

46
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,333
Dancing cheek to cheek

47
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:02,232
Heaven

48
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:05,271
I'm in heaven

49
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:08,766
And the cares that hung around me

50
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,808
Through the week

51
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,776
Seem to vanish

52
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:17,041
Like a gambler's lucky streak

53
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,422
Paul, what is it?

54
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,259
My God.

55
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,797
I've got to get out of here.

56
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:59,225
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

57
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:02,520
...whether you want it to or not.
It's silly.

58
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:06,296
Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?

59
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:11,972
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

60
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,572
Over 60 years.

61
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:16,572
Paul, I'm your friend.

62
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:24,845
I ever tell you that I was
a prison guard during the Depression?

63
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,916
You've mentioned it.

64
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,290
Did I mention I was
in charge of death row?

65
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,753
That I supervised all the executions?

66
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,836
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

67
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,671
We called ours "The Green Mile."

68
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,376
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

69
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,869
We had the electric chair.

70
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,142
"Old Sparky," we called it.

71
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:59,382
I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

72
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,020
...but 1935, that takes the prize.

73
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,122
That year, I had...

74
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,592
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

75
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,732
It was...

76
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:17,032
It was also the year of...

77
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:19,699
...John Coffey...

78
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,309
...and the two dead girls.

79
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:39,886
Put me through to E Block.

80
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,334
E Block.

81
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,799
Right.

82
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:22,226
Paul? Prisoner.

83
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:23,987
Christ, give me a minute.

84
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:30,831
You all right?

85
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:37,443
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.

86
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,326
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

87
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:57,258
With the new arrival?
You know better.

88
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:59,332
Besides...

89
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:03,336
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

90
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:08,303
- Let's look alive, Dean.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:16,842
Damn.

92
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,185
They're riding on the axle.

93
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,263
What'd they do?

94
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,260
They bust the springs?

95
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,544
Dead man!

96
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:46,005
Dead man walking!

97
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:49,746
We got a dead man walking here!

98
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,052
Jesus please us,
what is he yelling about?

99
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,193
You might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

100
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:02,828
He's enormous.

101
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,998
Can't be bigger than you.

102
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,806
Dead man!

103
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,140
Dead man walking!

104
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:20,813
Dead man!

105
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,508
Dead man walking!

106
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,687
Dead man walking here!

107
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:28,249
Dead man!

108
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:33,756
We got a dead man walking here!

109
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,624
Dead man walking!

110
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:41,463
- We got a dead man walking here!
- Percy.

111
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,165
That's enough.

112
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,795
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

113
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:15,925
Can you talk?

114
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:25,504
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

115
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:34,986
Move your ass.

116
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,589
Let's go.

117
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,556
Come on.

118
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:44,796
Percy...

119
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,963
...they're moving house
in the infirmary.

120
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:52,471
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

121
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,833
They got all the men they need.

122
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,134
Why don't you just make sure?

123
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:03,676
I don't care where you go, as long as
it's not here at this moment.

124
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,284
All right.

125
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,531
God, you bust my finger.

126
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:27,138
I wiped that grin
off your face, didn't I?

127
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:29,673
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

128
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,680
Fuck you, Percy.

129
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:47,187
We'll get that looked at, Del.
In the meantime, stay quiet.

130
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:56,495
I let Harry take those chains off you...

131
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,366
...you gonna be nice?

132
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,057
Your name is John Coffey.

133
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:18,992
Yes, sir, boss.

134
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:22,728
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

135
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,563
You can spell, can you?

136
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:28,163
Just my name, boss.

137
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,268
J... O...

138
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,638
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

139
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:37,339
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

140
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,604
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

141
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,242
Questions?

142
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:47,451
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

143
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:53,626
Because I get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

144
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,887
...if it's a strange place.

145
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:05,772
It stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

146
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,565
We keep a few lights burning
in the corridor.

147
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,678
The corridor?

148
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:14,713
Right out there.

149
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,411
You can sit.

150
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,099
I couldn't help it, boss.

151
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:12,770
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

152
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,973
Take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

153
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,752
Of course they are.
I heard the bones crack.

154
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,783
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

155
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,955
How could I miss it?
The whole prison heard.

156
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,054
Goddamn Percy.

157
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,729
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

158
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,865
I'll chew that food when I have to.

159
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:44,568
Right now I wanna hear about this
new inmate. Aside from how big he is.

160
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,470
Monstrous big. Damn.

161
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:49,642
He seems meek enough.

162
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,639
Is he retarded, you figure?

163
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,746
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

164
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:58,247
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

165
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,824
Make your blood curdle.

166
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,776
- What?! For God's sake, what?
- The girls! The girls are gone!

167
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,487
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

168
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,623
Oh, my God.

169
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,871
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone.
You tell them we headed west.

170
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:54,164
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

171
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,842
Central! Are you on the line?

172
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,208
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

173
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,318
IKatie!

174
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:16,863
Cora!

175
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,429
Jesus.

176
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:51,897
Jesus.

177
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,175
I'll kill you!

178
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,574
I'll kill you!

179
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,037
I couldn't help it.

180
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:44,640
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

181
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:51,449
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

182
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,061
I interrupt?

183
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:59,291
Well, I'm just about done.

184
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,578
How's your pretty gal?

185
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,777
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

186
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:18,609
Not so well at all.

187
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:21,952
More headaches?

188
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:25,115
Got laid up with another one yesterday.

189
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:27,258
Worst one yet.

190
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:31,897
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

191
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:35,697
Head x-rays and who knows what else.

192
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,666
She is scared to death.

193
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,708
Truth to tell, so am I.

194
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,878
If it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

195
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:49,277
...maybe they can fix it.

196
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:51,477
Maybe.

197
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:57,681
This just came in.

198
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,324
DOE on Bitterbuck.

199
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:05,798
You didn't come down here
to hand me a DOE.

200
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,904
I had an angry call from the
state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

201
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,837
Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

202
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,336
It is.

203
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,747
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

204
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:23,745
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

205
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:25,815
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

206
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,984
Little Percy calls his aunt...

207
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,656
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

208
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:37,389
He mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

209
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:40,361
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

210
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,159
I didn't hear that.
I'm sure she didn't either.

211
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,302
He is mean, careless and stupid...

212
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:48,269
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

213
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:51,043
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

214
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,608
Stick with it, Paul.

215
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,537
It may not be much longer.

216
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:59,252
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

217
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,011
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

218
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,618
Administration job.

219
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:05,320
Better pay.

220
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,996
Then why is he still here?

221
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,227
He can get that application
pushed through.

222
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,733
With his connections, he could have
any state job he wants.

223
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,165
You know what I think?

224
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,779
I think he just wants to
see one cook up close.

225
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:33,687
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

226
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:38,715
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

227
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,759
...you'll keep the peace?

228
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:42,256
Of course.

229
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,857
Of course.

230
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:47,894
Thank you, Paul.

231
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:52,906
Hal...

232
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,466
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

233
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:01,242
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

234
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,776
You bet.

235
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:36,280
The music too loud?

236
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:41,878
There's just this empty spot
in the bed where my husband sleeps.

237
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,117
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

238
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,758
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

239
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,434
Is that what's got you up?

240
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,139
Yeah, that...

241
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:01,974
...and things.

242
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:04,476
Things.

243
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,113
We got a new inmate today.

244
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:14,754
Simple-minded fella.

245
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:18,225
Do I wanna know what he did?

246
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,392
No.

247
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:24,022
Things that happen in this world.

248
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,793
It's a wonder God allows it.

249
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:34,104
Why don't you come to bed?

250
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:38,001
I think I have something
that'll help you sleep.

251
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,505
You can have all you want.

252
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:45,185
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

253
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:47,386
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

254
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:49,722
Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?

255
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:50,991
No.

256
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:55,421
He'll want me to take sulfa tablets...

257
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,130
...and I'll spend the week
puking in my office.

258
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:02,358
It will run its course by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

259
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,772
Poor old guy.

260
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:38,932
The legislature loosened up the purse
strings enough to hire on a new guard.

261
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:48,840
Look again.

262
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,579
He's right...

263
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:51,952
...there.

264
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:04,093
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people.

265
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:07,196
- Maybe it's rabid.
- Oh, my Christ.

266
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:10,198
- It could be.
- Oh, the big mouse expert.

267
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:12,532
The Mouse Man.

268
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:15,706
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

269
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,070
I don't see its mouth at all.

270
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,554
- Brutal, we'll be hip-deep in mice.
- I just wanna see what he'll do.

271
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:34,084
In the interest of science, like.

272
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:16,569
He's in the damn restraint room.

273
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,203
He's chewing the padding
out of the walls...

274
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:21,373
...making himself a nice little nest.

275
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:28,213
All right.

276
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,010
Let's go get the damn mouse.

277
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:43,793
Boss.

278
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:46,363
Saw me a mouse go by.

279
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,764
Can't put anything over on you.

280
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,932
You let him get past you.

281
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:26,571
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

282
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,604
Then where the hell is he?

283
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:30,275
Well, I don't know.

284
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,644
Three grown men...

285
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:37,951
...outsmarted by a mouse.

286
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:45,321
Bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

287
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:50,826
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

288
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:44,882
You little son of a bitch.

289
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,385
Well, I'll be damned.

290
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:53,417
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

291
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,361
That's a goddamn mouse.

292
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,490
Brute said he was
in here last night...

293
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:02,291
...begging for food.

294
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,963
He come right on up to the desk.

295
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:07,331
Give him some room.

296
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:09,667
See what he does.

297
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,181
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

298
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:55,219
Goddamn!

299
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:57,952
You little scurvy!

300
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,960
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

301
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:04,293
I'm gonna kill you!

302
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,026
I'm gonna take you out!

303
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:12,737
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

304
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,974
It's just a little mouse, dumb merde.

305
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:16,971
You ugly little piece of sh...

306
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,803
- Are you listening to me?
- Fuck!

307
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:23,740
I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

308
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:25,382
...you little piece of shit!

309
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,665
Percy met your mouse.

310
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:55,539
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

311
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,384
Percy, we already tried that.

312
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,323
What'd you say?

313
00:34:05,592 --> 00:34:06,991
I said that we...

314
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:13,958
IKnock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

315
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,181
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

316
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:34,481
Don't that beat the mousy band?

317
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,689
You wanna think about
what you were doing?

318
00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:46,490
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

319
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,201
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

320
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,028
...not to mention the inmates.

321
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:53,634
So what?

322
00:34:53,907 --> 00:34:57,343
They aren't in cradle school,
case you didn't notice.

323
00:34:58,045 --> 00:34:59,979
Although you treat them that way.

324
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,306
We don't scare them
any more than we have to.

325
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,140
They're under enough strain.

326
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:07,443
Men under strain can snap.

327
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:11,157
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

328
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,657
...talking...

329
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:15,860
...not yelling.

330
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,029
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

331
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:23,695
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

332
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:25,633
That's all.

333
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,665
Anybody doesn't like it?

334
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:31,137
You can kiss my ass.

335
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:34,208
You try it. Go on.

336
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:38,076
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

337
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:39,875
Okay, Brutal.

338
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:54,664
We all know who your connections are.

339
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:59,262
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

340
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:01,072
Job be damned.

341
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,109
You done?

342
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:12,309
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

343
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:35,700
Arlen...

344
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,508
...your daughter and her family
are here.

345
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:48,920
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

346
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,492
Sitting down, sitting down!

347
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:56,353
Rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

348
00:36:56,663 --> 00:36:58,528
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

349
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,330
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

350
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:05,834
- Is his head properly shaved?
- It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

351
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:07,505
I will take that as a yes.

352
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:09,071
Let's go, Arlen.

353
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,944
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

354
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:16,876
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

355
00:37:17,217 --> 00:37:19,014
...walking the Mile.

356
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:22,254
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

357
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,184
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

358
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:29,861
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

359
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,564
And I hope they forgive me...

360
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,495
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

361
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,571
We're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

362
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:41,773
...hollering and shaking his dick.

363
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,510
- Actually...
- Still praying, still praying.

364
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:46,836
- Getting right with Jesus.
- Do it quietly!

365
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:48,546
You old gink!

366
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:49,947
As I was saying...

367
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,742
...I don't believe they actually
shake their dicks.

368
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:56,486
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

369
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,191
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked up.

370
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:03,325
On your feet, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

371
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,258
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

372
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:09,832
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

373
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:11,900
Walking the Mile.

374
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:13,799
Walking in the Mile.

375
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:16,772
Sitting down now.

376
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:20,809
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

377
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:22,213
What do I do?

378
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:24,941
Watch and learn.

379
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:33,258
Getting strapped.

380
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:36,125
Getting clamped.

381
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,422
Getting wired.

382
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:42,629
All right.

383
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,934
Getting all electrode.

384
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:52,645
Roll on one.

385
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,547
"Roll on one" means I turn
the generator up full.

386
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:58,976
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

387
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:00,877
Arlen Bitterbuck...

388
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:03,787
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

389
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:07,151
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

390
00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:10,194
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

391
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:16,966
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

392
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:19,562
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face...

393
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:22,501
...because I'm one horny motherfucker.

394
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:28,179
You bastard.

395
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,743
That's a good one.

396
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,377
Quiet.

397
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:33,886
Quiet! Shut up!

398
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,620
- Shut up!
- Sorry, boss.

399
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:40,984
One more remark like that, I'll
have Van Hay roll on two for real.

400
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,695
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

401
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:45,863
It was pretty funny.

402
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,634
I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

403
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:53,205
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

404
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,771
Ever try not to laugh in church...

405
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,307
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

406
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:01,213
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

407
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:03,038
Let's keep going.

408
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:10,582
Soak the sponge.

409
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,893
Putting on the black hood.

410
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:20,399
And putting on my cap.

411
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,635
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

412
00:40:22,936 --> 00:40:25,837
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

413
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,999
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

414
00:40:33,046 --> 00:40:34,809
Hush up there, Toot.

415
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:39,652
Getting screwed.

416
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,619
I'm getting the cap.

417
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,194
Arlen Bitterbuck...

418
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:51,827
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

419
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:54,259
...in accordance with state law.

420
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:57,099
God have mercy on your soul.

421
00:40:58,472 --> 00:40:59,837
Amen.

422
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:03,333
Roll on two.

423
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:08,914
And that's that.

424
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:15,251
I'm frying! I'm frying!

425
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:20,015
I'm a done tom turkey!

426
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:24,661
This is a shocking experience!

427
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,391
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

428
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:38,137
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

429
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:40,777
Get that idiot out of the chair.

430
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:45,469
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

431
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:50,014
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

432
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:52,378
...and live there forever?

433
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:56,822
Could that be what heaven's like?

434
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,793
I just about believe that very thing.

435
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:10,198
Had me a young wife when I was 18.

436
00:43:10,937 --> 00:43:15,499
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

437
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:19,302
And she'd lie there after...

438
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,645
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

439
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,044
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

440
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:32,618
That was my best time.

441
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:54,304
It'll be fine.

442
00:43:55,649 --> 00:43:57,207
You'll do fine.

443
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:37,014
Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

444
00:44:37,357 --> 00:44:41,293
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

445
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:43,960
God have mercy on your soul.

446
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,808
Roll on two.

447
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:50,525
Again.

448
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,062
Adios, chief.

449
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:04,033
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

450
00:46:06,746 --> 00:46:08,771
He's paid what he owed.

451
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:11,512
He's square with the house again...

452
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:14,345
...so keep your goddamn hands off him!

453
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,404
What's up his ass?

454
00:46:36,676 --> 00:46:37,904
You.

455
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:41,469
Always. You, Percy.

456
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:45,208
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

457
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,551
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

458
00:46:51,157 --> 00:46:53,921
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

459
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:57,725
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

460
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:02,532
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

461
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,135
Yeah, you heard me.

462
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:08,297
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

463
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:16,179
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

464
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:18,815
I just wanna be out front, is all.

465
00:47:20,186 --> 00:47:22,086
Come on. One time.

466
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:24,788
And then you know what?

467
00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:27,925
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

468
00:47:28,194 --> 00:47:29,957
And if I say no?

469
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:34,598
Well, I might just
stick around for good.

470
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,366
Make me a career of this...

471
00:47:38,738 --> 00:47:40,000
...boss.

472
00:48:32,892 --> 00:48:34,154
You won't believe this.

473
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,933
Look.

474
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:50,007
I done tame me that mouse.

475
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:52,441
We see that.

476
00:48:54,113 --> 00:48:56,775
Watch this. Watch what he do.

477
00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:06,489
Ain't he something now?

478
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,654
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

479
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:12,022
- Mr. Jingles?
- That his name.

480
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,591
He whispered in my ear.

481
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:16,202
Hey, captain...

482
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:20,063
...could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

483
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:22,933
Your English gets better
when you want something.

484
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:25,108
Wanna see what else he can do?

485
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,078
Watch, watch.

486
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:31,249
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

487
00:49:31,784 --> 00:49:33,081
Wanna play fetch?

488
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,181
Play fetch. Watch, watch, watch.

489
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:58,339
He fetch it every time. Every time.

490
00:49:59,178 --> 00:50:03,774
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

491
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,111
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

492
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:11,389
When I get out,
he'll make me rich.

493
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:14,155
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

494
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:16,620
We play fetch again?

495
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:19,126
Well, well, well.

496
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,759
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

497
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:23,832
Don't hurt him.

498
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:27,801
Is that the one I chased?

499
00:50:28,274 --> 00:50:29,832
Yeah, that's the one.

500
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:33,606
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

501
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,679
Is that so?

502
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,642
Del's been asking for a box.

503
00:50:39,552 --> 00:50:41,144
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it.

504
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:43,211
Might keep it for a pet.

505
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:46,953
What do you think?

506
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:52,027
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

507
00:50:52,565 --> 00:50:57,093
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

508
00:51:00,406 --> 00:51:02,465
That should do real nice.

509
00:51:11,951 --> 00:51:14,351
Man said get a cigar box.

510
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:31,735
Hal, you wanted to see me?

511
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,907
Close the door.

512
00:51:43,249 --> 00:51:44,910
So you know...

513
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:48,919
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

514
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:51,646
"William Wharton."

515
00:51:52,525 --> 00:51:54,083
He's what you call...

516
00:51:54,494 --> 00:51:56,394
...a problem child.

517
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,925
Got "Billy the IKid" tattooed
on his left arm.

518
00:52:01,234 --> 00:52:05,193
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

519
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:07,831
...causing all kinds of trouble.

520
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,573
Finally hit the big time.

521
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:15,242
IKilled three people in a holdup.

522
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:17,573
One of them a pregnant woman.

523
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:22,119
Bad news all around.

524
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:37,762
It's a tumor, Paul.

525
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:41,166
A brain tumor.

526
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:44,067
They got...

527
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:47,002
...x- ray pictures of it.

528
00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:50,948
It's the size of a lemon, they said.

529
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:54,879
And...

530
00:52:56,222 --> 00:52:57,621
...way down...

531
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:01,652
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

532
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:05,354
I haven't told her.

533
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:09,133
I can't think how.

534
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:14,997
For the life of me, Paul...

535
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:19,510
...I can't think how to
tell my wife...

536
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,982
...she's going to die.

537
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:51,693
Oh, oh, God.

538
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:53,938
Oh, God.

539
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,241
I'm going.

540
00:54:59,512 --> 00:55:00,376
What?

541
00:55:00,646 --> 00:55:03,410
To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

542
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:05,248
Today.

543
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:08,412
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

544
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:09,979
That bad?

545
00:55:10,823 --> 00:55:12,188
Oh, yeah.

546
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:36,440
The boy's doped to the gills.

547
00:55:39,518 --> 00:55:40,610
Hand me them clothes.

548
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:45,620
William Wharton?

549
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,257
You put on these clothes now.

550
00:55:57,436 --> 00:55:58,460
We'll have to do this.

551
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:02,297
Hellraiser, huh?

552
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:05,168
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

553
00:56:09,048 --> 00:56:12,745
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

554
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:15,144
You're gonna ride the lightning.

555
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:19,881
Shut up, give us a hand.

556
00:56:20,893 --> 00:56:22,485
Hellraiser.

557
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:54,958
You don't look so good.

558
00:56:57,029 --> 00:56:58,929
Look like you're running you a fever.

559
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,260
Boss Edgecomb?

560
00:57:07,873 --> 00:57:09,738
I needs to see you down here.

561
00:57:12,378 --> 00:57:14,573
I got things to tend to, John Coffey.

562
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,615
You just stay still in your cell.

563
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:33,424
E Block.

564
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:11,168
Come on, let's go.

565
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:14,496
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

566
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:30,380
Careful.

567
00:58:34,026 --> 00:58:34,856
Careful.

568
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:35,855
Step up.

569
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,126
Step up.

570
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:19,165
Ain't this a party now?

571
00:59:19,672 --> 00:59:20,661
- Is it or what?
- Let him go.

572
00:59:20,973 --> 00:59:22,497
- Shoot him.
- See who you hit.

573
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:24,207
Shoot the son of a bitch.

574
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:25,305
Shoot him!

575
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:28,169
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it! Hit him.

576
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,846
Hit me, you limp noodle.

577
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:30,945
Hit him, Percy!

578
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,342
Goddamn it, hit him!

579
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:33,811
Come on, Percy. Hit me.

580
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:35,515
I'm warning you.

581
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:37,152
You warning me?

582
00:59:37,756 --> 00:59:38,586
I'm warning you!

583
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:40,792
- You're warning me?!
- Shoot him!

584
00:59:41,093 --> 00:59:42,390
Well, come on...

585
00:59:49,034 --> 00:59:49,966
You're a big fucker.

586
00:59:51,303 --> 00:59:52,668
Where'd you come from?

587
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,715
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

588
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:07,508
All right. Let it breathe.

589
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,155
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

590
01:00:12,157 --> 01:00:13,784
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

591
01:00:14,126 --> 01:00:17,027
- Didn't see it coming.
- Come on, boy, breathe.

592
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:19,230
Come on. Just breathe.

593
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:24,192
We thought he was doped.

594
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:28,734
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

595
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:30,668
You didn't ask?

596
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:33,874
I guess that's not a mistake...

597
01:00:34,313 --> 01:00:37,441
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

598
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:55,124
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

599
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:59,104
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

600
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,873
Say the situation's under control.
It's not a story.

601
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:04,734
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

602
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:07,171
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

603
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:10,778
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

604
01:01:11,617 --> 01:01:13,551
Go on now. Go.

605
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,286
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

606
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:53,356
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

607
01:01:56,962 --> 01:02:00,090
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

608
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:02,299
...not a good time at all.

609
01:02:02,568 --> 01:02:06,595
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

610
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:29,989
Closer.

611
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:32,564
You know you ain't
supposed to do that.

612
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:36,199
Mind your business, Del.

613
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:47,845
What do you want, John Coffey?

614
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:49,970
Just to help it.

615
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:55,150
Don't be afraid.

616
01:02:55,821 --> 01:02:56,719
Help!

617
01:02:57,623 --> 01:02:58,385
Help!

618
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,318
Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

619
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:02,025
Help!

620
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:03,316
What are you doing?

621
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:09,930
Boss Howell! Help!

622
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,330
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

623
01:03:31,156 --> 01:03:33,249
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

624
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:36,493
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

625
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:39,287
Del, for chrissakes, shut up!

626
01:04:25,978 --> 01:04:28,105
What did you just do to me?

627
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:31,776
I helped it.

628
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,441
Didn't I help it?

629
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:37,780
I just took it back, is all.

630
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:41,124
Awful tired now, boss.

631
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,319
Dog-tired.

632
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:10,488
Boss, what that man do to you?

633
01:06:13,051 --> 01:06:15,679
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

634
01:06:17,623 --> 01:06:20,285
Oh, not too bad.

635
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:23,288
What did the doctor say?

636
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:27,258
You know doctors.

637
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:29,630
Gobbledygook, mostly.

638
01:06:30,802 --> 01:06:32,099
Gobbledygook.

639
01:06:47,419 --> 01:06:48,909
Having stew tonight.

640
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:00,923
What are you doing?

641
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:09,502
What does it feel like?

642
01:07:10,475 --> 01:07:12,841
Well, I know what it feels like.

643
01:07:16,548 --> 01:07:18,345
It feels great.

644
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,814
Not that I'm complaining...

645
01:07:59,091 --> 01:08:02,720
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

646
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:05,325
Yeah, we did, at your mom's.

647
01:08:06,932 --> 01:08:08,832
Wanna tell me what's going on?

648
01:08:12,738 --> 01:08:13,670
Well...

649
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:17,307
...see, the thing is...

650
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:22,068
...I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

651
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:28,047
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

652
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:32,722
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

653
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,020
That's swell. Thanks.

654
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:38,853
Yeah, I'm sure I'll feel better.

655
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:49,105
You're sure you ought to do this?

656
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:52,903
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

657
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:12,729
Burt, you got some company.

658
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:14,988
Can I offer you a cold drink?

659
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:18,325
Yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

660
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:21,762
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

661
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,632
Hope I'm not troubling you.

662
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:26,400
Well, that depends, Mr?

663
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:30,647
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

664
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,247
The Green Mile.

665
01:09:33,518 --> 01:09:36,510
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

666
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:39,014
I'd like to ask you about one.

667
01:09:41,293 --> 01:09:43,193
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

668
01:09:48,033 --> 01:09:48,931
Which client?

669
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:53,965
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

670
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:55,500
John Coffey.

671
01:09:56,808 --> 01:09:57,832
Coffey.

672
01:09:58,410 --> 01:09:59,502
Causing you problems?

673
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:03,514
Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

674
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:05,578
...but other than that...

675
01:10:05,884 --> 01:10:09,047
He cries, does he?
Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

676
01:10:09,387 --> 01:10:10,820
You know what he did.

677
01:10:11,623 --> 01:10:13,557
I read the court transcript.

678
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:15,287
Thank you, missus.

679
01:10:15,594 --> 01:10:17,221
My pleasure.

680
01:10:18,196 --> 01:10:18,924
IKids!

681
01:10:19,231 --> 01:10:21,392
Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

682
01:10:21,733 --> 01:10:22,927
Coming, Mama!

683
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:26,261
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

684
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:29,236
I wonder if he did anything
like that before.

685
01:10:30,775 --> 01:10:32,675
Why? Has he said anything?

686
01:10:32,944 --> 01:10:36,004
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

687
01:10:36,314 --> 01:10:40,148
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

688
01:10:40,418 --> 01:10:44,252
...that it might be easy enough to
follow his back trail. Find out.

689
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:48,787
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

690
01:10:49,094 --> 01:10:51,995
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

691
01:10:52,297 --> 01:10:54,322
Believe me, we tried.

692
01:10:55,267 --> 01:10:57,360
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

693
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,635
How can that be?

694
01:10:59,938 --> 01:11:04,034
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

695
01:11:04,342 --> 01:11:08,278
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

696
01:11:08,613 --> 01:11:11,605
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

697
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:14,714
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

698
01:11:15,687 --> 01:11:17,154
He is...

699
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:19,556
...strange, I admit.

700
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:24,256
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

701
01:11:24,796 --> 01:11:27,162
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

702
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:30,229
I deal with them day in and day out.

703
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:33,662
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

704
01:11:33,972 --> 01:11:36,839
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

705
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,140
Do you?

706
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,272
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

707
01:11:43,548 --> 01:11:45,516
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

708
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:47,512
And yet you defended him.

709
01:11:48,653 --> 01:11:51,121
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

710
01:11:51,656 --> 01:11:53,146
IKids! Lunch!

711
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:54,685
Y'all listen to your mama!

712
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:00,898
I'll tell you something.

713
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:05,559
You listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

714
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,132
I'm listening.

715
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:09,640
We had us a dog.

716
01:12:10,775 --> 01:12:12,709
Just a sweet mongrel.

717
01:12:13,011 --> 01:12:14,410
You know the kind.

718
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,247
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

719
01:12:20,218 --> 01:12:21,810
You get to know it.

720
01:12:22,153 --> 01:12:26,453
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

721
01:12:26,725 --> 01:12:30,126
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

722
01:12:31,763 --> 01:12:35,790
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

723
01:12:36,968 --> 01:12:39,061
My wife and I were not so lucky.

724
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:42,572
Caleb, come here for a second.

725
01:12:44,075 --> 01:12:45,167
Come here.

726
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:47,871
Please, son.

727
01:12:49,547 --> 01:12:51,981
He still has the one good eye.

728
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:55,544
I suppose he's lucky...

729
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:58,185
...not to be completely blind.

730
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,622
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

731
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:06,728
Right, Caleb?

732
01:13:09,634 --> 01:13:10,498
Go on in, now.

733
01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:16,872
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

734
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:19,635
Just got it in his mind one day.

735
01:13:20,512 --> 01:13:21,911
The same with John Coffey.

736
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,310
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

737
01:13:27,085 --> 01:13:28,814
But those little girls...

738
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:31,520
...stayed raped and murdered.

739
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:34,157
Maybe he'd never done it before.

740
01:13:36,027 --> 01:13:38,086
My dog never bit before.

741
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:42,559
But I didn't concern myself with that.

742
01:13:43,668 --> 01:13:47,536
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

743
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,065
Is Coffey guilty?

744
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:54,738
Yes, he is.

745
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:57,005
Don't you doubt it.

746
01:13:57,482 --> 01:13:59,848
And don't you turn your back on him.

747
01:14:00,785 --> 01:14:04,812
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

748
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,314
...but in the end...

749
01:14:09,461 --> 01:14:10,860
...you'll get bit.

750
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:25,942
Oh, me! Oh, my!

751
01:14:32,851 --> 01:14:34,978
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

752
01:14:35,587 --> 01:14:37,384
It's from my missus.

753
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:43,423
She wanted to thank you.

754
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:46,227
Thank me for what?

755
01:14:46,731 --> 01:14:47,891
Well, you know.

756
01:14:50,735 --> 01:14:52,066
For helping me.

757
01:14:52,837 --> 01:14:54,304
Helping you with what?

758
01:14:55,106 --> 01:14:56,130
You know.

759
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:04,647
Was your missus pleased?

760
01:15:06,584 --> 01:15:08,108
Several times.

761
01:15:23,768 --> 01:15:27,169
John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

762
01:15:30,141 --> 01:15:32,336
Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

763
01:15:33,044 --> 01:15:36,502
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

764
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:43,051
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

765
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:47,415
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't I?

766
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:52,687
It's yours, John. As you please.

767
01:15:53,398 --> 01:15:55,958
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

768
01:16:01,906 --> 01:16:04,033
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

769
01:16:06,377 --> 01:16:09,073
John, that's so very fine of you.

770
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:13,811
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.
My mama'd thank you too, but she dead.

771
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,879
Welcome.

772
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:21,315
What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

773
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:26,929
Here come the boss man.

774
01:16:27,866 --> 01:16:30,266
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

775
01:16:41,746 --> 01:16:43,680
You get that one for free.

776
01:16:44,749 --> 01:16:46,307
But that's the last one.

777
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:50,052
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

778
01:16:50,722 --> 01:16:53,919
I guess I'm gonna have to
pay you out for the rest.

779
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,271
Good shot, weren't it?

780
01:17:11,643 --> 01:17:13,668
The look on your face!

781
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:19,606
You believe this?

782
01:17:19,884 --> 01:17:22,045
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

783
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:24,787
Did y'all like that?

784
01:17:25,056 --> 01:17:27,251
I'm cooking up some turds
to go with it.

785
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,049
Nice soft ones.

786
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:32,490
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

787
01:17:34,098 --> 01:17:37,795
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

788
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:42,404
Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

789
01:17:43,975 --> 01:17:46,944
What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

790
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:49,270
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

791
01:17:49,814 --> 01:17:53,045
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

792
01:18:06,764 --> 01:18:09,028
You can come in here on your legs...

793
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:11,632
...but you'll go out on your backs.

794
01:18:11,903 --> 01:18:15,066
Billy the IKid gonna
guarantee you that.

795
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,438
Come on, fuck-stick.

796
01:18:16,874 --> 01:18:20,935
No sneaking up on me this time.
We'll go man-to-man.

797
01:18:24,515 --> 01:18:25,504
Piss on me?

798
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,770
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

799
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:59,345
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

800
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,619
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

801
01:19:01,886 --> 01:19:05,322
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

802
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:07,522
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

803
01:19:08,226 --> 01:19:12,060
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

804
01:19:14,232 --> 01:19:15,790
Thank you, Wild Bill.

805
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:25,306
Not in there.

806
01:19:25,576 --> 01:19:26,736
I'll be good.

807
01:19:27,045 --> 01:19:29,536
Honest injun, I will. I will.

808
01:19:34,752 --> 01:19:36,014
He's pitching a fit.

809
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,016
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

810
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:49,097
Hey, fellers!

811
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,866
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

812
01:19:59,177 --> 01:20:01,668
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

813
01:20:09,654 --> 01:20:11,679
I learned my lesson.

814
01:20:12,056 --> 01:20:13,489
I'll be good.

815
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:27,638
Hey, Toot.

816
01:20:29,907 --> 01:20:31,807
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

817
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,742
Little Black Sambo!

818
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:17,614
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

819
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:21,250
Hope your bags are packed.

820
01:21:21,726 --> 01:21:23,626
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

821
01:21:23,928 --> 01:21:25,828
Where are we going? Let's go!

822
01:21:39,277 --> 01:21:41,541
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original.

823
01:21:41,846 --> 01:21:43,313
Gotta give him that.

824
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:05,060
Del, grab up your things. It's
a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

825
01:22:05,369 --> 01:22:06,631
What you talking about?

826
01:22:06,938 --> 01:22:10,533
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

827
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,139
Not just prison guards.

828
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:15,538
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

829
01:22:17,748 --> 01:22:19,113
You fellas coming?

830
01:22:19,383 --> 01:22:22,819
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

831
01:22:24,055 --> 01:22:26,353
But you knock them for a loop.

832
01:22:26,657 --> 01:22:28,352
You knock them for a loop.

833
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,987
Just like Mr. Harry says.

834
01:22:42,807 --> 01:22:45,037
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

835
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:48,201
All right, rehearsing now!

836
01:22:48,512 --> 01:22:50,912
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

837
01:22:51,349 --> 01:22:54,512
I been fixing the plumbing here
for 10 years.

838
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,013
Ain't never had to wear no tie before.

839
01:22:57,321 --> 01:23:01,189
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

840
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:05,018
All right, everybody have a seat.

841
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:22,536
This is great.

842
01:23:31,422 --> 01:23:35,882
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

843
01:23:36,227 --> 01:23:37,660
...until you are dead...

844
01:23:37,962 --> 01:23:40,260
...in accordance with state law.

845
01:23:40,665 --> 01:23:43,099
God have mercy on your soul.

846
01:23:51,876 --> 01:23:52,934
Roll on two.

847
01:23:57,214 --> 01:23:58,112
That's that.

848
01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:04,620
Very good. Very professional.

849
01:24:07,224 --> 01:24:08,714
Let's do it again.

850
01:24:09,393 --> 01:24:12,362
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

851
01:24:12,663 --> 01:24:13,391
Thank you.

852
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:17,065
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

853
01:24:17,368 --> 01:24:20,337
You got that chin strap tight,
because his head will buck...

854
01:24:20,938 --> 01:24:22,599
All right, break it up.

855
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:27,903
So?

856
01:24:28,212 --> 01:24:30,942
They love Mr. Jingles.
They laugh over there.

857
01:24:31,215 --> 01:24:35,447
They cheer. They clap their hands.

858
01:24:35,786 --> 01:24:37,651
Well, that's just aces.

859
01:24:38,522 --> 01:24:40,046
Isn't that something?

860
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:42,416
You done good, old-timer.

861
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,455
We're happy for you.

862
01:24:46,063 --> 01:24:47,792
Yeah, we are.

863
01:25:04,448 --> 01:25:05,710
Percy, you shit.

864
01:25:08,652 --> 01:25:09,346
Come on.

865
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:10,654
Del, get up.

866
01:25:10,988 --> 01:25:14,446
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

867
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:17,522
I was just playing. Come on, now.

868
01:25:17,828 --> 01:25:19,227
I was just having...

869
01:25:21,966 --> 01:25:23,456
Ain't you sweet?

870
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:26,570
Soft like a girl.

871
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:28,735
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

872
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:30,940
...than your sister's pussy, I think.

873
01:25:31,409 --> 01:25:32,501
Wharton!

874
01:25:37,948 --> 01:25:41,782
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

875
01:25:42,153 --> 01:25:44,485
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty head.

876
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:47,985
Your noodle ain't
limp at all, lover-boy.

877
01:25:48,292 --> 01:25:50,886
I think you sweet on
old Billy the IKid.

878
01:25:53,464 --> 01:25:55,432
But smell you.

879
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:03,570
Look.

880
01:26:03,941 --> 01:26:05,272
He done piss his pants.

881
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:09,240
Oh, my God.

882
01:26:10,815 --> 01:26:12,476
Look what the big man done.

883
01:26:12,783 --> 01:26:15,047
He bust other people with a stick.

884
01:26:18,322 --> 01:26:22,486
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

885
01:26:25,529 --> 01:26:26,791
Learn when to shut up.

886
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:29,726
All right, now.

887
01:26:31,302 --> 01:26:32,826
Don't touch me.

888
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:51,711
You talk about this to anyone...

889
01:26:52,256 --> 01:26:54,315
...I'll get you all fired.

890
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,685
I swear that to God.

891
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:03,867
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

892
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:14,542
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

893
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:17,206
You just keep on laughing!

894
01:27:20,084 --> 01:27:22,575
Wetmore a good name for you!

895
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:26,820
Percy Wetmore do a dance

896
01:27:27,091 --> 01:27:29,924
Listen to him squishing in his pant

897
01:27:41,338 --> 01:27:44,330
Well, what about Dean?
He's got a little boy.

898
01:27:44,642 --> 01:27:47,133
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

899
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:52,543
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

900
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,381
Maybe forget to feed him.

901
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,515
How he keep up with his training?
He just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

902
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,861
All right. I'll take him, then.

903
01:28:12,736 --> 01:28:13,668
Me.

904
01:28:15,105 --> 01:28:17,505
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you kindly, but...

905
01:28:19,009 --> 01:28:21,204
...you live out in the woods.

906
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:23,074
Mr. Jingle, he be...

907
01:28:23,847 --> 01:28:27,010
...he be scared to live
out in the big woods.

908
01:28:31,956 --> 01:28:33,548
How about Mouseville?

909
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:35,790
Mouseville?

910
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,426
Tourist attraction down in Florida.

911
01:28:39,463 --> 01:28:40,930
Tallahassee, I think.

912
01:28:41,398 --> 01:28:43,696
Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

913
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:45,059
Tallahassee.

914
01:28:45,369 --> 01:28:48,861
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

915
01:28:51,308 --> 01:28:55,074
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

916
01:28:56,146 --> 01:28:57,613
You think he's got the stuff?

917
01:28:57,948 --> 01:28:59,711
I mean, he is pretty smart.

918
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:02,685
What is Mouseville?

919
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:04,987
Tourist attraction, I said.

920
01:29:05,356 --> 01:29:06,914
They got this big tent.

921
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:10,250
- You have to pay?
- Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

922
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:11,591
Dime apiece.

923
01:29:12,129 --> 01:29:14,290
- Two cents for the kids.
- For the kids.

924
01:29:14,598 --> 01:29:16,657
Inside the tent they got this...

925
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:18,765
...mouse city...

926
01:29:19,703 --> 01:29:21,136
...made out of...

927
01:29:21,438 --> 01:29:26,000
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

928
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:30,742
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

929
01:29:32,082 --> 01:29:34,949
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

930
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:38,653
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

931
01:29:42,893 --> 01:29:43,825
Yeah, that's it.

932
01:29:45,729 --> 01:29:47,356
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

933
01:29:52,536 --> 01:29:55,437
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

934
01:29:56,114 --> 01:29:59,948
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

935
01:30:03,521 --> 01:30:04,283
There he goes.

936
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,798
Mr. Jingles!

937
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:26,510
I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

938
01:30:27,312 --> 01:30:29,610
It was just a matter of time, really.

939
01:30:29,914 --> 01:30:32,940
You fucking cruel bastard!

940
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:43,058
Give him to me.

941
01:30:43,795 --> 01:30:46,320
Give him to me. Might still be time.

942
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:00,577
What are you doing?

943
01:31:04,249 --> 01:31:05,807
What the hell...?

944
01:31:06,184 --> 01:31:07,811
Please, John.

945
01:31:09,087 --> 01:31:10,213
Help him.

946
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:13,657
Please, Johnny, help him.

947
01:31:17,662 --> 01:31:20,096
Oh, dear Jesus.

948
01:31:20,431 --> 01:31:21,728
The tail.

949
01:31:22,534 --> 01:31:23,523
Look at the tail.

950
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:55,114
What'd you do?

951
01:32:55,827 --> 01:32:58,421
I helped Del's mouse...

952
01:32:58,896 --> 01:33:00,193
...his circus mouse.

953
01:33:00,965 --> 01:33:03,092
Gonna live in a mouse city...

954
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:04,800
...down in...

955
01:33:06,904 --> 01:33:08,030
Florida.

956
01:33:11,275 --> 01:33:13,072
Boss Percy bad.

957
01:33:13,444 --> 01:33:17,346
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

958
01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:20,178
I took it back, though.

959
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:28,819
Brute...

960
01:33:29,661 --> 01:33:31,561
...you come along with me.

961
01:33:31,963 --> 01:33:35,023
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

962
01:33:59,123 --> 01:34:01,489
Now, don't start in on me.

963
01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:03,894
It was just a mouse.

964
01:34:04,195 --> 01:34:06,459
Never belonged here
in the first place.

965
01:34:06,764 --> 01:34:08,425
The mouse is fine.

966
01:34:09,634 --> 01:34:10,362
Just fine.

967
01:34:10,668 --> 01:34:13,159
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are...

968
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:15,605
...at anything else around here.

969
01:34:17,842 --> 01:34:20,106
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?

970
01:34:22,013 --> 01:34:24,504
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

971
01:34:24,816 --> 01:34:27,046
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

972
01:34:28,219 --> 01:34:30,414
After all those talks we had about...

973
01:34:30,988 --> 01:34:32,751
...keeping the prisoners calm?

974
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:36,391
- Aren't you relieved?
- What kind of game is this?

975
01:34:36,661 --> 01:34:38,060
It's no game.

976
01:34:38,463 --> 01:34:39,725
See for yourself.

977
01:34:42,967 --> 01:34:44,093
Go on.

978
01:34:57,548 --> 01:35:00,415
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

979
01:35:04,555 --> 01:35:07,786
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

980
01:35:08,593 --> 01:35:12,723
I always keep a spare mouse in
my wallet for occasions such as this.

981
01:35:13,064 --> 01:35:15,658
Yeah, you playing with me.
Both of you.

982
01:35:15,967 --> 01:35:18,265
Just who the hell you think you are?

983
01:35:21,272 --> 01:35:22,933
We're the people you work with.

984
01:35:23,574 --> 01:35:25,064
But not for long.

985
01:35:26,244 --> 01:35:28,109
Percy, I want your word.

986
01:35:28,746 --> 01:35:29,508
My word?

987
01:35:30,281 --> 01:35:32,806
I put you out front for Del...

988
01:35:33,851 --> 01:35:36,979
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the next day.

989
01:35:39,524 --> 01:35:43,984
What if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

990
01:35:44,295 --> 01:35:46,388
- Bullying me.
- Go ahead.

991
01:35:47,431 --> 01:35:50,195
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

992
01:35:50,501 --> 01:35:51,661
Over a mouse?

993
01:35:51,969 --> 01:35:53,061
No.

994
01:35:53,905 --> 01:35:58,274
But four men will swear you stood by
while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean.

995
01:35:58,543 --> 01:36:02,411
About that, people will care.
Even your uncle the governor.

996
01:36:02,713 --> 01:36:05,147
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

997
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:09,982
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

998
01:36:10,321 --> 01:36:12,050
I put you out front...

999
01:36:12,456 --> 01:36:14,651
...you put in for that transfer.

1000
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,588
That's the deal.

1001
01:36:22,033 --> 01:36:23,125
All right.

1002
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:35,377
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1003
01:37:37,775 --> 01:37:39,436
Hey, boys.

1004
01:37:40,811 --> 01:37:44,008
No, now, say hey, Mr Jingles.

1005
01:37:46,284 --> 01:37:48,775
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1006
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:04,661
Boss Edgecomb.

1007
01:38:05,403 --> 01:38:06,802
Yes, Del?

1008
01:38:07,104 --> 01:38:09,629
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1009
01:38:11,275 --> 01:38:13,903
Here. You take him.

1010
01:38:22,753 --> 01:38:25,745
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1011
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:28,189
...you know.

1012
01:38:30,461 --> 01:38:32,053
I'll take him, boss.

1013
01:38:32,863 --> 01:38:35,263
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1014
01:38:40,204 --> 01:38:44,504
You take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1015
01:39:05,696 --> 01:39:07,527
You gonna take him to Mouseville?

1016
01:39:08,532 --> 01:39:10,693
We'll do it together, most likely.

1017
01:39:11,969 --> 01:39:14,199
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1018
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:18,301
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1019
01:39:18,809 --> 01:39:21,505
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1020
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:22,440
That's right, Del.

1021
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,274
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1022
01:39:30,988 --> 01:39:32,353
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1023
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:39,628
I sure wish I could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1024
01:40:18,969 --> 01:40:20,834
Hope he's good and scared.

1025
01:40:21,172 --> 01:40:25,836
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1026
01:40:35,186 --> 01:40:36,881
Del, it's all right.

1027
01:41:19,763 --> 01:41:20,821
Roll on one.

1028
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:35,440
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1029
01:41:36,947 --> 01:41:40,314
You be so quiet and so still.

1030
01:41:44,054 --> 01:41:45,419
Eduard Delacroix...

1031
01:41:45,956 --> 01:41:49,187
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1032
01:41:49,527 --> 01:41:53,190
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1033
01:41:53,731 --> 01:41:56,564
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1034
01:42:05,176 --> 01:42:07,110
I sorry for what l...

1035
01:42:14,385 --> 01:42:16,512
I sorry for what I do.

1036
01:42:17,054 --> 01:42:19,318
I give anything to take it back.

1037
01:42:20,424 --> 01:42:21,982
But I can't.

1038
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,351
God have mercy on me.

1039
01:42:26,197 --> 01:42:28,165
Ainsi soit-il. Amen.

1040
01:42:36,907 --> 01:42:38,499
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1041
01:42:43,747 --> 01:42:45,146
There's no such place.

1042
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:49,745
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1043
01:42:52,389 --> 01:42:54,755
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1044
01:43:56,987 --> 01:43:58,011
Eduard Delacroix...

1045
01:43:59,023 --> 01:44:02,481
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1046
01:44:03,093 --> 01:44:05,186
...in accordance with state law.

1047
01:44:06,463 --> 01:44:08,897
God have mercy on your soul.

1048
01:44:48,108 --> 01:44:49,132
Roll on two!

1049
01:45:06,026 --> 01:45:07,118
The sponge is dry.

1050
01:45:07,428 --> 01:45:08,156
What?

1051
01:45:14,868 --> 01:45:17,530
- The goddamn sponge is dry!
- Well, don't you stop him!

1052
01:45:17,838 --> 01:45:20,363
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1053
01:45:35,589 --> 01:45:37,022
Is this normal?

1054
01:45:37,324 --> 01:45:39,884
God, the smell.

1055
01:45:41,161 --> 01:45:43,652
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1056
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:45,722
They're about done, I reckon!

1057
01:45:50,671 --> 01:45:53,071
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1058
01:45:58,178 --> 01:45:59,941
He's cooking now!

1059
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:02,305
He's cooking now!

1060
01:46:02,616 --> 01:46:04,846
We gonna have a hoedown!

1061
01:46:05,219 --> 01:46:08,120
'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1062
01:46:08,989 --> 01:46:10,183
Give me some!

1063
01:46:10,524 --> 01:46:12,424
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling...

1064
01:46:13,861 --> 01:46:15,829
I said give me some!

1065
01:46:19,533 --> 01:46:21,398
I smell it!

1066
01:46:23,604 --> 01:46:24,366
Smell it!

1067
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:33,268
Should I kill the juice?

1068
01:46:33,647 --> 01:46:35,046
No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1069
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:00,104
He's frying now!

1070
01:47:00,374 --> 01:47:01,898
He's frying now!

1071
01:47:04,945 --> 01:47:06,207
Why don't you shut it down?

1072
01:47:06,513 --> 01:47:09,812
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1073
01:47:16,156 --> 01:47:18,818
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1074
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,888
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1075
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:26,294
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1076
01:47:32,339 --> 01:47:33,067
IKill it!

1077
01:47:40,314 --> 01:47:41,178
You do it!

1078
01:47:41,448 --> 01:47:43,348
You're running this show, ain't you?

1079
01:48:11,345 --> 01:48:13,813
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1080
01:48:16,416 --> 01:48:17,383
Brutal!

1081
01:48:17,751 --> 01:48:18,615
Brutal, no!

1082
01:48:19,519 --> 01:48:20,508
What do you mean, no?

1083
01:48:20,888 --> 01:48:22,446
You saw what he did!

1084
01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:25,690
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1085
01:48:25,993 --> 01:48:28,393
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1086
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:40,064
What in the blue fuck was that?

1087
01:48:41,174 --> 01:48:42,573
Jesus Christ.

1088
01:48:42,843 --> 01:48:45,607
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1089
01:48:45,913 --> 01:48:47,574
And the smell.

1090
01:48:48,348 --> 01:48:52,114
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for 5 years.

1091
01:48:52,452 --> 01:48:54,010
That's what I'm betting.

1092
01:48:55,055 --> 01:48:58,286
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1093
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:00,224
You can hear him up there!

1094
01:49:00,861 --> 01:49:03,352
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1095
01:49:14,107 --> 01:49:16,268
Okay, boys, okay.

1096
01:49:16,877 --> 01:49:19,812
Now, what in the hell happened?

1097
01:49:20,113 --> 01:49:21,580
An execution.

1098
01:49:21,982 --> 01:49:22,971
A successful one.

1099
01:49:23,517 --> 01:49:27,476
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1100
01:49:28,422 --> 01:49:30,856
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1101
01:49:32,659 --> 01:49:33,387
Isn't he?

1102
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,726
Something to say?

1103
01:49:45,839 --> 01:49:48,137
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1104
01:49:49,609 --> 01:49:52,134
How many years you spend
pissing on the toilet seat...

1105
01:49:52,446 --> 01:49:54,505
...before someone told you
to put it up?

1106
01:49:54,815 --> 01:49:56,510
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1107
01:49:56,817 --> 01:49:58,284
Pure and simple.

1108
01:49:59,019 --> 01:50:00,646
That's your official position?

1109
01:50:01,021 --> 01:50:02,886
Don't you think it should be?

1110
01:50:03,323 --> 01:50:07,259
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1111
01:50:07,594 --> 01:50:09,994
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1112
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:11,727
Isn't that right, Percy?

1113
01:50:14,968 --> 01:50:16,560
Barbecue

1114
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:20,237
Me and you
Stinky, pinky

1115
01:50:21,375 --> 01:50:24,344
Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1116
01:50:24,644 --> 01:50:27,545
It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix

1117
01:50:29,616 --> 01:50:30,412
Barbecue

1118
01:50:31,284 --> 01:50:32,512
Me and you

1119
01:50:32,886 --> 01:50:34,285
Stinky, pinky

1120
01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:37,823
Weren't Billy, Jilly...

1121
01:50:39,126 --> 01:50:43,028
You're 10 seconds away from spending the
rest of your life in the padded room.

1122
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:02,505
Poor old Del.

1123
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,078
Poor old Del.

1124
01:51:14,261 --> 01:51:15,489
You okay?

1125
01:51:16,863 --> 01:51:18,990
I could feel it from here.

1126
01:51:19,733 --> 01:51:21,098
What do you mean?

1127
01:51:22,102 --> 01:51:23,592
You could hear it.

1128
01:51:23,937 --> 01:51:26,064
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1129
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,271
He out of it now, though.

1130
01:51:29,176 --> 01:51:30,905
He the lucky one.

1131
01:51:31,578 --> 01:51:35,173
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1132
01:51:42,089 --> 01:51:43,556
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1133
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:47,191
He run away under that door.

1134
01:51:48,862 --> 01:51:50,921
Don't think he'll be back.

1135
01:51:52,466 --> 01:51:54,900
He felt it too, through me.

1136
01:51:56,703 --> 01:51:58,671
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1137
01:51:59,306 --> 01:52:02,207
All that hurt just spill out.

1138
01:52:09,049 --> 01:52:11,279
Awful tired now, boss.

1139
01:52:13,253 --> 01:52:14,777
Dog-tired.

1140
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,284
Me too, John.

1141
01:52:25,132 --> 01:52:26,224
Me too.

1142
01:53:26,226 --> 01:53:27,784
I hate this.

1143
01:53:28,662 --> 01:53:29,890
I know.

1144
01:53:51,718 --> 01:53:53,276
I am so happy to see you.

1145
01:53:55,355 --> 01:53:57,050
Look at you.

1146
01:53:58,058 --> 01:53:59,992
We missed you at church.

1147
01:54:03,897 --> 01:54:06,195
My hair...

1148
01:54:06,533 --> 01:54:09,263
- You look fine.
- I'm just a mess.

1149
01:54:14,741 --> 01:54:16,936
She's having one of her good days.

1150
01:54:17,611 --> 01:54:19,408
I thank God for that.

1151
01:54:22,048 --> 01:54:23,640
What's a bad day?

1152
01:54:27,187 --> 01:54:28,916
Sometimes she's...

1153
01:54:30,490 --> 01:54:31,752
...she's not herself anymore.

1154
01:54:32,559 --> 01:54:33,856
She swears.

1155
01:54:34,194 --> 01:54:35,593
She swears?

1156
01:54:35,895 --> 01:54:37,385
It just pops out.

1157
01:54:38,131 --> 01:54:40,656
Most awful language you can imagine.

1158
01:54:40,967 --> 01:54:43,162
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1159
01:54:44,604 --> 01:54:47,402
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1160
01:54:47,707 --> 01:54:50,767
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice...

1161
01:54:55,081 --> 01:54:57,481
I'm glad she's having a good day.

1162
01:54:58,718 --> 01:55:01,016
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1163
01:55:17,237 --> 01:55:18,261
Honey...

1164
01:55:18,872 --> 01:55:21,432
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1165
01:55:22,108 --> 01:55:25,202
...I'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1166
01:55:34,287 --> 01:55:36,187
I'm thinking I love you.

1167
01:55:38,224 --> 01:55:41,591
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1168
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:51,368
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1169
01:55:55,508 --> 01:55:57,874
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1170
01:55:58,311 --> 01:55:59,539
Well, thank you.

1171
01:55:59,913 --> 01:56:02,541
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1172
01:56:02,949 --> 01:56:04,280
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1173
01:56:04,784 --> 01:56:06,911
Brutal, you gonna hog all them taters?

1174
01:56:07,287 --> 01:56:09,687
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1175
01:56:10,023 --> 01:56:10,955
Come on, now.

1176
01:56:12,425 --> 01:56:15,087
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1177
01:56:15,395 --> 01:56:17,659
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1178
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,864
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1179
01:56:23,203 --> 01:56:24,864
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1180
01:56:25,438 --> 01:56:27,167
He did the same thing to me.

1181
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:29,608
He put his hands on me.

1182
01:56:30,477 --> 01:56:32,502
He took my bladder infection away.

1183
01:56:37,517 --> 01:56:38,381
It's true.

1184
01:56:38,685 --> 01:56:40,880
When he came home that day, he was...

1185
01:56:42,589 --> 01:56:43,851
...all better.

1186
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,291
Now, wait.
You're talking about...

1187
01:56:48,595 --> 01:56:50,153
...an authentic healing?

1188
01:56:51,631 --> 01:56:52,859
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1189
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:54,826
I am.

1190
01:56:57,337 --> 01:57:00,397
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1191
01:57:01,474 --> 01:57:03,374
What's it got to do with us?

1192
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:05,209
You're thinking about Melinda.

1193
01:57:05,478 --> 01:57:06,809
Melinda?

1194
01:57:07,514 --> 01:57:08,242
Melinda Moores?

1195
01:57:08,681 --> 01:57:12,310
So, Paul, you really think
you can help her?

1196
01:57:13,019 --> 01:57:17,149
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1197
01:57:18,258 --> 01:57:21,022
...but there might be a chance.
- Hold on now.

1198
01:57:21,327 --> 01:57:25,991
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1199
01:57:26,299 --> 01:57:28,426
No, Hal would never stand for that.

1200
01:57:28,768 --> 01:57:31,259
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything, even if it fell on him.

1201
01:57:31,604 --> 01:57:33,094
So you're talking about...

1202
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,740
...taking John Coffey to her.

1203
01:57:40,847 --> 01:57:43,338
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1204
01:57:44,484 --> 01:57:45,849
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1205
01:57:46,152 --> 01:57:49,053
- Dang right it is.
- No, not for you, Dean.

1206
01:57:49,355 --> 01:57:52,324
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1207
01:57:52,692 --> 01:57:54,250
That way, you can deny everything.

1208
01:57:55,128 --> 01:57:56,527
Why do I have to stay behind?

1209
01:57:58,731 --> 01:58:00,596
Our boy's grown up...

1210
01:58:00,867 --> 01:58:02,061
...gone off to school.

1211
01:58:02,368 --> 01:58:04,802
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1212
01:58:05,305 --> 01:58:06,465
Brutal's a single man.

1213
01:58:06,806 --> 01:58:10,071
You're the only one here with
two children, another on the way.

1214
01:58:10,543 --> 01:58:13,512
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1215
01:58:15,882 --> 01:58:18,442
Brutal, help me out here.

1216
01:58:19,886 --> 01:58:21,615
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1217
01:58:21,921 --> 01:58:23,354
The finest.

1218
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:25,681
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1219
01:58:26,059 --> 01:58:28,459
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1220
01:58:28,728 --> 01:58:30,389
I have no doubt.

1221
01:58:31,798 --> 01:58:33,766
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1222
01:58:34,067 --> 01:58:37,093
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1223
01:58:38,304 --> 01:58:40,397
Now, what if he escapes?

1224
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:43,800
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1225
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:47,307
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1226
01:58:47,614 --> 01:58:49,309
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1227
01:58:51,117 --> 01:58:52,345
In fact...

1228
01:58:55,088 --> 01:58:56,817
...I don't think he did it at all.

1229
01:59:00,026 --> 01:59:03,689
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1230
01:59:03,997 --> 01:59:05,988
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1231
01:59:06,366 --> 01:59:10,700
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1232
01:59:12,539 --> 01:59:13,528
And plus...

1233
01:59:14,107 --> 01:59:15,836
...he's huge.

1234
01:59:16,342 --> 01:59:21,177
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1235
01:59:21,447 --> 01:59:25,383
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1236
01:59:25,818 --> 01:59:26,944
I'd insist on that.

1237
01:59:28,388 --> 01:59:31,050
If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1238
01:59:31,824 --> 01:59:33,587
...we'd have to take him down.

1239
01:59:34,327 --> 01:59:35,225
You understand?

1240
01:59:47,173 --> 01:59:48,401
So...

1241
01:59:49,242 --> 01:59:50,971
...tell us what you had in mind.

1242
01:59:58,351 --> 01:59:59,283
There it is.

1243
01:59:59,619 --> 02:00:00,984
I see it.

1244
02:00:11,731 --> 02:00:13,631
You think this is enough?

1245
02:00:14,901 --> 02:00:16,391
I don't know.

1246
02:00:53,206 --> 02:00:54,696
You fellas thirsty?

1247
02:00:55,208 --> 02:00:56,607
Fresh out of the icebox.

1248
02:00:56,909 --> 02:00:58,467
You bet. That's swell, Brutal.

1249
02:00:58,811 --> 02:01:00,472
- Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.

1250
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:01,712
Hot in here.

1251
02:01:02,015 --> 02:01:02,879
Boy, howdy.

1252
02:01:03,216 --> 02:01:06,344
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't I?

1253
02:01:06,686 --> 02:01:10,019
- My ass, you get some too.
- What makes you think you deserve any?

1254
02:01:10,723 --> 02:01:12,691
Because I got a big pecker.

1255
02:01:13,059 --> 02:01:15,721
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1256
02:01:16,329 --> 02:01:18,820
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1257
02:01:19,265 --> 02:01:20,664
Don't be stingy hogs.

1258
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:25,301
Come on.

1259
02:01:26,539 --> 02:01:28,473
Come on now, fellers.

1260
02:01:29,709 --> 02:01:30,835
Come on, boss.

1261
02:01:31,177 --> 02:01:32,906
I been good all day.

1262
02:01:36,249 --> 02:01:37,841
It's hot in here.

1263
02:01:38,184 --> 02:01:41,620
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1264
02:01:41,921 --> 02:01:43,684
Why don't you give me some?

1265
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:51,724
Come on.

1266
02:01:56,936 --> 02:01:58,563
You gonna stay behaved?

1267
02:01:59,105 --> 02:02:00,367
Come on, you clunk, give me that.

1268
02:02:00,707 --> 02:02:02,265
You promise me...

1269
02:02:02,775 --> 02:02:04,868
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1270
02:02:05,445 --> 02:02:07,845
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

1271
02:02:08,448 --> 02:02:09,847
I'll be good.

1272
02:02:34,841 --> 02:02:35,739
Cup.

1273
02:03:26,626 --> 02:03:29,060
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1274
02:03:29,862 --> 02:03:31,557
After this, there's no turning back.

1275
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:34,257
So?

1276
02:03:35,234 --> 02:03:36,326
We gonna do this?

1277
02:03:36,936 --> 02:03:39,837
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1278
02:03:40,139 --> 02:03:42,266
I'd like to take a ride.

1279
02:03:47,613 --> 02:03:49,513
Guess we're all in.

1280
02:04:00,726 --> 02:04:01,886
What is this?

1281
02:04:04,463 --> 02:04:05,361
Payback.

1282
02:04:05,631 --> 02:04:07,121
That's right.

1283
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:14,668
- No, you let me go! Let go of me!
- Settle down.

1284
02:04:14,974 --> 02:04:15,872
- Let go!
- Settle down.

1285
02:04:16,142 --> 02:04:17,336
What are you doing?

1286
02:04:17,643 --> 02:04:18,473
Settle down.

1287
02:04:26,786 --> 02:04:28,447
"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."

1288
02:04:29,689 --> 02:04:32,852
- What would your mother say?
- You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1289
02:04:33,159 --> 02:04:35,787
I know people. Big people!

1290
02:04:36,295 --> 02:04:39,287
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1291
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:41,499
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1292
02:04:41,767 --> 02:04:44,327
You're dead wrong about that, you know.

1293
02:04:50,109 --> 02:04:52,270
You gonna put your arms up?

1294
02:04:53,212 --> 02:04:56,272
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1295
02:04:58,551 --> 02:05:00,075
There you go.

1296
02:05:08,394 --> 02:05:09,725
Please, Paul.

1297
02:05:10,029 --> 02:05:13,726
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1298
02:05:15,067 --> 02:05:16,932
You would think that.

1299
02:05:18,638 --> 02:05:21,038
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1300
02:05:21,307 --> 02:05:23,639
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1301
02:05:23,943 --> 02:05:26,241
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1302
02:05:26,545 --> 02:05:29,571
We can and we are.

1303
02:05:36,422 --> 02:05:40,950
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1304
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:44,821
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1305
02:05:53,839 --> 02:05:55,830
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1306
02:05:56,175 --> 02:05:58,234
What do you say if somebody stops by?

1307
02:06:00,112 --> 02:06:01,841
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1308
02:06:02,181 --> 02:06:05,275
...so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1309
02:06:05,651 --> 02:06:07,380
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1310
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:08,618
What about me?

1311
02:06:08,955 --> 02:06:11,423
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1312
02:06:11,757 --> 02:06:14,783
...on account of how big a screw-up
the execution was.

1313
02:06:17,196 --> 02:06:18,788
We going for the ride now?

1314
02:06:19,131 --> 02:06:21,656
That's right. We going for the ride.

1315
02:06:23,903 --> 02:06:25,200
What about us, Dean?

1316
02:06:25,538 --> 02:06:29,269
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1317
02:06:29,575 --> 02:06:32,100
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1318
02:06:35,548 --> 02:06:37,573
Where you think you going?

1319
02:06:44,256 --> 02:06:45,484
You a bad man.

1320
02:06:45,825 --> 02:06:48,089
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1321
02:06:55,968 --> 02:06:57,765
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1322
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:59,501
What's wrong?

1323
02:07:23,529 --> 02:07:26,589
Whole room, whole room's spinning.

1324
02:07:26,899 --> 02:07:29,060
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1325
02:07:29,335 --> 02:07:31,667
Had me some shine or...

1326
02:07:32,471 --> 02:07:33,733
...or what?

1327
02:07:36,108 --> 02:07:38,736
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1328
02:07:39,045 --> 02:07:40,569
White man...

1329
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:45,340
...ought not to sit in no nigger
electric chair. No, sir.

1330
02:07:52,625 --> 02:07:55,253
He a bad man.

1331
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:16,004
Look, boss.

1332
02:08:20,653 --> 02:08:23,213
It's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1333
02:08:24,056 --> 02:08:25,751
John, we have to be quiet now.

1334
02:08:26,392 --> 02:08:28,724
You see her? You see the lady?

1335
02:08:29,028 --> 02:08:30,996
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1336
02:08:42,508 --> 02:08:44,339
Let's go. Go, go!

1337
02:08:48,848 --> 02:08:49,906
Now!

1338
02:09:26,085 --> 02:09:28,019
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

1339
02:10:02,721 --> 02:10:04,052
Upsy-daisy.

1340
02:10:13,933 --> 02:10:15,992
Do you know where we're taking you?

1341
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:20,530
Help a lady?

1342
02:10:22,608 --> 02:10:24,007
That's right.

1343
02:10:24,944 --> 02:10:26,002
How do you know?

1344
02:10:27,947 --> 02:10:29,175
Don't know.

1345
02:10:31,217 --> 02:10:35,654
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1346
02:10:37,056 --> 02:10:38,148
I never have.

1347
02:11:13,559 --> 02:11:15,493
We can still turn back.

1348
02:11:17,529 --> 02:11:18,518
Boss, look.

1349
02:11:19,031 --> 02:11:20,658
Someone's up.

1350
02:11:22,301 --> 02:11:24,030
This was a mistake.

1351
02:11:24,536 --> 02:11:26,231
Christ, what were we thinking?

1352
02:11:26,538 --> 02:11:29,701
It's too late now. John, you stay.

1353
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:37,181
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1354
02:11:47,493 --> 02:11:50,087
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1355
02:11:50,396 --> 02:11:52,591
It's us. It's Paul and Brutal.

1356
02:11:52,898 --> 02:11:54,229
- It's us.
- Jesus.

1357
02:11:54,533 --> 02:11:56,592
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1358
02:11:56,902 --> 02:12:00,269
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1359
02:12:00,606 --> 02:12:01,573
Are you hostages?

1360
02:12:02,975 --> 02:12:04,237
Who's out there?

1361
02:12:04,743 --> 02:12:06,608
- Who's by that truck?
- Harry, the lights!

1362
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:12,845
John Coffey.

1363
02:12:13,552 --> 02:12:14,484
Halt!

1364
02:12:14,753 --> 02:12:16,948
- Stay where you are!
- Take it easy, now.

1365
02:12:17,356 --> 02:12:19,187
- Don't you move!
- Wait!

1366
02:12:19,491 --> 02:12:20,685
I'm warning you.

1367
02:12:20,993 --> 02:12:22,426
Halt or I'll shoot!

1368
02:12:22,761 --> 02:12:24,661
- I said halt!
- Hal, put the gun down!

1369
02:12:30,369 --> 02:12:32,837
Who are you talking to down there?

1370
02:12:33,205 --> 02:12:34,103
Goddamn it!

1371
02:12:34,373 --> 02:12:38,707
Now, nobody is hurt.
And we are here to help.

1372
02:12:39,011 --> 02:12:42,105
Help what? I don't understand.

1373
02:12:42,448 --> 02:12:45,178
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1374
02:13:01,867 --> 02:13:03,266
What do you want?

1375
02:13:05,971 --> 02:13:07,871
Make them go away!

1376
02:13:08,941 --> 02:13:12,638
I don't want no salesmen...

1377
02:13:12,945 --> 02:13:14,606
...in the middle of the night.

1378
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:18,875
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling...

1379
02:13:19,251 --> 02:13:20,513
Just to help.

1380
02:13:21,353 --> 02:13:24,049
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1381
02:13:24,757 --> 02:13:27,954
You can't. No one can.

1382
02:13:39,405 --> 02:13:41,737
- Stay out of here!
- Don't you go in there!

1383
02:13:42,074 --> 02:13:44,907
- Whoever you are, just stay out!
- Don't you do it!

1384
02:13:45,577 --> 02:13:48,137
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1385
02:13:49,915 --> 02:13:52,383
You stop now. You hear me?

1386
02:13:53,118 --> 02:13:55,678
- Paul, I don't want him up there.
- Boss...

1387
02:13:56,088 --> 02:13:58,113
...you just be quiet now.

1388
02:14:46,004 --> 02:14:48,302
It's all right, Hal. It's all right.

1389
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:51,040
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1390
02:14:57,349 --> 02:14:59,783
Don't come near me, pig-fucker.

1391
02:15:13,765 --> 02:15:15,960
Why do you have so many scars?

1392
02:15:18,937 --> 02:15:21,098
Who hurt you so badly?

1393
02:15:22,774 --> 02:15:25,004
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1394
02:15:27,613 --> 02:15:29,342
What's your name?

1395
02:15:30,015 --> 02:15:33,109
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1396
02:15:33,552 --> 02:15:35,747
...only not spelt the same.

1397
02:15:42,528 --> 02:15:43,517
Ma'am?

1398
02:15:51,637 --> 02:15:53,468
Yes, John Coffey?

1399
02:15:55,307 --> 02:15:56,774
I see it.

1400
02:15:57,543 --> 02:15:58,601
I see it.

1401
02:16:05,851 --> 02:16:08,445
What's happening?

1402
02:16:09,821 --> 02:16:13,951
You be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1403
02:17:40,746 --> 02:17:43,078
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1404
02:17:43,482 --> 02:17:45,643
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1405
02:17:47,319 --> 02:17:50,982
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1406
02:17:54,326 --> 02:17:56,817
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1407
02:18:10,676 --> 02:18:11,836
How did I get here?

1408
02:18:16,348 --> 02:18:19,340
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1409
02:18:19,751 --> 02:18:20,877
Remember?

1410
02:18:22,354 --> 02:18:23,480
Melly...

1411
02:18:24,122 --> 02:18:25,851
...it doesn't matter.

1412
02:18:26,692 --> 02:18:28,091
It doesn't matter anymore.

1413
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:30,920
Did I have the x-ray?

1414
02:18:31,697 --> 02:18:33,096
Did I?

1415
02:18:35,901 --> 02:18:37,027
Yes.

1416
02:18:38,003 --> 02:18:41,939
Yes. It was clear.
There was no tumor.

1417
02:18:59,658 --> 02:19:00,886
Can you stand up?

1418
02:19:01,193 --> 02:19:03,161
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1419
02:19:15,741 --> 02:19:17,231
What's your name?

1420
02:19:18,577 --> 02:19:20,670
John Coffey, ma'am.

1421
02:19:22,247 --> 02:19:23,805
Like the drink.

1422
02:19:25,383 --> 02:19:27,317
Only not spelt the same.

1423
02:19:27,819 --> 02:19:31,380
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1424
02:19:36,328 --> 02:19:37,659
No, you can't.

1425
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:04,411
I dreamed of you.

1426
02:20:07,325 --> 02:20:10,123
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1427
02:20:11,730 --> 02:20:13,527
And so was I.

1428
02:20:15,433 --> 02:20:17,526
And we found each other.

1429
02:20:18,537 --> 02:20:21,062
We found each other in the dark.

1430
02:20:40,725 --> 02:20:42,317
Take it, John. It's a present.

1431
02:20:42,828 --> 02:20:44,819
It's St. Christopher.

1432
02:20:46,131 --> 02:20:48,258
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1433
02:20:49,201 --> 02:20:51,601
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1434
02:20:52,103 --> 02:20:53,502
Please.

1435
02:20:54,005 --> 02:20:55,563
Wear it for me.

1436
02:21:10,255 --> 02:21:11,950
Thank you, ma'am.

1437
02:21:14,125 --> 02:21:15,854
Thank you, John.

1438
02:21:22,601 --> 02:21:27,368
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1439
02:21:27,706 --> 02:21:31,369
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1440
02:21:47,158 --> 02:21:50,127
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1441
02:21:50,528 --> 02:21:52,621
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1442
02:21:53,531 --> 02:21:55,624
I give him a few days.

1443
02:21:56,001 --> 02:21:59,368
One of us will do a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1444
02:21:59,638 --> 02:22:02,266
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1445
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:04,735
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1446
02:22:18,657 --> 02:22:21,125
Am I happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1447
02:22:21,426 --> 02:22:23,451
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1448
02:22:23,762 --> 02:22:24,694
What happened to him?

1449
02:22:25,196 --> 02:22:28,188
He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1450
02:22:31,736 --> 02:22:33,169
Okay, John.

1451
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:38,667
We're gonna set you down
on your bed now. Here we go.

1452
02:22:56,795 --> 02:22:57,853
Well?

1453
02:22:59,798 --> 02:23:01,561
What about Mrs. Moores?

1454
02:23:03,702 --> 02:23:05,567
Was it like the mouse?

1455
02:23:06,972 --> 02:23:07,961
Was it...

1456
02:23:10,141 --> 02:23:12,974
...you know, a miracle?

1457
02:23:15,814 --> 02:23:17,873
Yes, it was.

1458
02:23:18,483 --> 02:23:19,507
Damn!

1459
02:23:35,367 --> 02:23:36,493
Now...

1460
02:23:37,168 --> 02:23:39,762
...I want to talk, not shout.

1461
02:23:40,105 --> 02:23:43,336
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1462
02:23:45,577 --> 02:23:48,671
My mama always said you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1463
02:23:52,517 --> 02:23:54,178
Guess she was wrong.

1464
02:23:57,489 --> 02:23:58,956
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1465
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:00,518
- In a minute.
- Now!

1466
02:24:00,859 --> 02:24:02,486
Right now! I want out now!

1467
02:24:07,132 --> 02:24:09,032
Shut up and listen.

1468
02:24:09,868 --> 02:24:13,702
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1469
02:24:14,506 --> 02:24:16,940
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

1470
02:24:17,442 --> 02:24:21,879
We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

1471
02:24:22,147 --> 02:24:26,243
...and pissed yourself like a frightened
little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1472
02:24:27,519 --> 02:24:28,986
But, Percy...

1473
02:24:29,687 --> 02:24:31,621
...you mind me now.

1474
02:24:32,157 --> 02:24:36,093
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1475
02:24:37,695 --> 02:24:38,889
We know people too.

1476
02:24:40,465 --> 02:24:42,660
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1477
02:24:45,336 --> 02:24:48,305
Let bygones be bygones.

1478
02:24:49,374 --> 02:24:51,968
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1479
02:24:52,477 --> 02:24:56,573
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1480
02:24:57,082 --> 02:25:00,483
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1481
02:25:01,586 --> 02:25:02,917
Always has.

1482
02:25:12,197 --> 02:25:14,597
May I be let out of this coat now?

1483
02:25:34,586 --> 02:25:35,644
My things?

1484
02:25:38,857 --> 02:25:40,825
Think it over, Percy.

1485
02:25:41,693 --> 02:25:43,456
I intend to.

1486
02:25:44,429 --> 02:25:47,455
I intend to think it over very hard.

1487
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:50,699
Starting right now.

1488
02:26:00,812 --> 02:26:04,077
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1489
02:26:18,563 --> 02:26:20,690
- Hey, let him go!
- John, let go!

1490
02:26:20,999 --> 02:26:21,931
Let go, John!

1491
02:26:22,267 --> 02:26:24,030
John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1492
02:26:24,335 --> 02:26:25,097
Let go, John! No!

1493
02:26:27,105 --> 02:26:28,003
Back off!

1494
02:26:28,907 --> 02:26:30,397
John, stop it!

1495
02:26:31,209 --> 02:26:32,506
Let him go! Back off!

1496
02:26:32,810 --> 02:26:33,742
John, let him go!

1497
02:26:49,727 --> 02:26:51,319
Oh, my God!

1498
02:27:34,806 --> 02:27:37,468
Easy, now. Easy.

1499
02:27:38,810 --> 02:27:40,141
Easy.

1500
02:27:50,822 --> 02:27:52,187
Are you all right?

1501
02:28:25,023 --> 02:28:26,991
Boy, what you looking at?

1502
02:28:34,932 --> 02:28:38,561
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1503
02:28:38,936 --> 02:28:43,066
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1504
02:29:04,529 --> 02:29:06,724
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1505
02:30:09,127 --> 02:30:11,618
I punished them bad men.

1506
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:13,891
I punished them both.

1507
02:30:14,232 --> 02:30:15,392
Why?

1508
02:30:16,367 --> 02:30:17,561
Why Wild Bill?

1509
02:30:18,970 --> 02:30:23,202
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1510
02:30:24,242 --> 02:30:26,039
I saw what Wild Billy'd done.

1511
02:30:26,711 --> 02:30:29,043
Saw it plain as day.

1512
02:30:30,248 --> 02:30:32,978
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1513
02:30:33,418 --> 02:30:34,476
What?

1514
02:30:36,387 --> 02:30:37,445
You saw what?

1515
02:30:41,426 --> 02:30:43,485
Take my hand, boss.

1516
02:30:46,697 --> 02:30:48,392
You see for yourself.

1517
02:30:52,136 --> 02:30:53,160
No.

1518
02:30:57,275 --> 02:30:58,606
Please.

1519
02:31:07,084 --> 02:31:08,642
No, no.

1520
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:10,448
Please.

1521
02:31:10,755 --> 02:31:15,351
I gots to, boss. I gots to
give you a little bit of myself.

1522
02:31:17,161 --> 02:31:18,526
A gift.

1523
02:31:19,931 --> 02:31:24,095
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1524
02:32:21,993 --> 02:32:23,290
Suppertime!

1525
02:32:23,728 --> 02:32:25,525
Bring the girls!

1526
02:32:29,066 --> 02:32:31,933
Girls! You heard your mama!

1527
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:35,532
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1528
02:32:53,958 --> 02:32:57,450
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1529
02:32:57,862 --> 02:32:59,523
Come get you some supper.

1530
02:33:02,533 --> 02:33:06,663
God is great, God is good,
and we thank You...

1531
02:33:31,128 --> 02:33:35,792
You love your sister? You make
any noise, you know what happens?

1532
02:33:36,067 --> 02:33:38,092
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1533
02:33:38,402 --> 02:33:41,838
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1534
02:33:42,106 --> 02:33:43,664
You understand?

1535
02:34:02,259 --> 02:34:06,195
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1536
02:34:07,498 --> 02:34:09,762
Now you see how it is.

1537
02:34:11,135 --> 02:34:13,968
That's the way it is every day.

1538
02:34:14,271 --> 02:34:18,367
That's the way it is all over the world.

1539
02:34:28,719 --> 02:34:29,583
Percy.

1540
02:34:29,887 --> 02:34:31,081
Percy Wetmore.

1541
02:34:32,123 --> 02:34:33,055
Son?

1542
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,388
Son?

1543
02:34:38,129 --> 02:34:41,064
- Son, can you hear me?
- Speak up if you can hear us.

1544
02:34:42,133 --> 02:34:45,125
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1545
02:34:46,971 --> 02:34:49,838
Percy, I got to ask you
a few questions.

1546
02:34:50,141 --> 02:34:53,338
One minute, he was fine,
and the next, blammo!

1547
02:34:53,644 --> 02:34:55,976
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1548
02:34:56,247 --> 02:34:58,408
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1549
02:34:59,850 --> 02:35:02,683
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1550
02:35:06,657 --> 02:35:09,922
I'll cover for you as much as I can...

1551
02:35:10,194 --> 02:35:12,424
...even if it means my job.

1552
02:35:13,164 --> 02:35:14,927
But I have to know...

1553
02:35:15,399 --> 02:35:18,527
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1554
02:35:21,505 --> 02:35:22,972
Does it, Paul?

1555
02:35:24,942 --> 02:35:26,136
No.

1556
02:36:53,631 --> 02:36:57,362
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1557
02:36:58,702 --> 02:37:00,363
Well, can he help?

1558
02:37:01,005 --> 02:37:03,735
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1559
02:37:04,008 --> 02:37:05,475
Stop the execution?

1560
02:37:05,776 --> 02:37:06,708
No.

1561
02:37:09,947 --> 02:37:11,380
Then don't tell him.

1562
02:37:12,116 --> 02:37:14,277
If it can't help, don't tell him.

1563
02:37:14,752 --> 02:37:15,912
Ever.

1564
02:37:18,322 --> 02:37:19,721
I won't.

1565
02:37:31,502 --> 02:37:33,800
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1566
02:37:35,339 --> 02:37:36,636
No.

1567
02:37:37,741 --> 02:37:40,232
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1568
02:37:40,511 --> 02:37:43,776
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways.

1569
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:48,275
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1570
02:37:49,954 --> 02:37:54,687
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of...

1571
02:37:55,326 --> 02:38:00,127
...but this is the first time I've
ever felt real danger of hell.

1572
02:38:01,198 --> 02:38:02,495
Hell?

1573
02:38:08,439 --> 02:38:09,997
Talk to him.

1574
02:38:11,242 --> 02:38:13,005
Talk to John.

1575
02:38:14,845 --> 02:38:16,813
Find out what he wants.

1576
02:38:33,797 --> 02:38:34,957
Hello, boss.

1577
02:38:36,033 --> 02:38:37,295
Hello, John.

1578
02:38:38,802 --> 02:38:41,134
I guess you know we're
coming down to it now.

1579
02:38:41,972 --> 02:38:43,633
Another couple of days.

1580
02:38:57,254 --> 02:38:59,984
Is there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1581
02:39:00,457 --> 02:39:02,687
We can rustle you up most anything.

1582
02:39:13,070 --> 02:39:17,666
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1583
02:39:18,008 --> 02:39:19,339
Okra.

1584
02:39:20,511 --> 02:39:23,241
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1585
02:39:24,181 --> 02:39:26,149
...if she don't mind.

1586
02:39:28,552 --> 02:39:29,883
Now...

1587
02:39:30,487 --> 02:39:35,322
...what about a preacher?
Somebody to say a little prayer with.

1588
02:39:35,592 --> 02:39:37,685
Don't want no preacher.

1589
02:39:38,796 --> 02:39:41,264
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1590
02:39:41,966 --> 02:39:43,024
Me?

1591
02:39:46,103 --> 02:39:48,867
Suppose I could, if it came to that.

1592
02:39:57,147 --> 02:39:59,877
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1593
02:40:01,618 --> 02:40:03,711
I know what you gonna say.

1594
02:40:04,288 --> 02:40:05,721
You don't have to say it.

1595
02:40:06,123 --> 02:40:09,388
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1596
02:40:13,397 --> 02:40:15,661
Tell me what you want me to do.

1597
02:40:16,633 --> 02:40:18,567
You want me to take you out of here?

1598
02:40:19,870 --> 02:40:23,806
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1599
02:40:25,342 --> 02:40:27,970
Why would you do such a foolish thing?

1600
02:40:30,047 --> 02:40:32,106
On the day of my judgment...

1601
02:40:33,017 --> 02:40:35,110
...when I stand before God...

1602
02:40:35,386 --> 02:40:39,152
...and He asks me why did I...

1603
02:40:39,423 --> 02:40:41,983
...did I kill one of His true...

1604
02:40:42,926 --> 02:40:44,416
...miracles...

1605
02:40:45,662 --> 02:40:47,755
...what am I going to say?

1606
02:40:48,766 --> 02:40:50,427
That it was my job?

1607
02:40:52,669 --> 02:40:54,603
It's my job.

1608
02:40:54,972 --> 02:40:59,534
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1609
02:41:02,746 --> 02:41:05,237
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1610
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:09,577
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1611
02:41:10,854 --> 02:41:13,789
I want it to be over and done with.

1612
02:41:14,525 --> 02:41:15,958
I do.

1613
02:41:20,464 --> 02:41:22,398
I'm tired, boss.

1614
02:41:23,867 --> 02:41:28,167
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1615
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:32,136
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1616
02:41:32,776 --> 02:41:37,270
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1617
02:41:38,215 --> 02:41:42,345
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1618
02:41:43,554 --> 02:41:47,456
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1619
02:41:47,724 --> 02:41:49,316
...every day.

1620
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:51,660
There's too much of it.

1621
02:41:52,062 --> 02:41:55,828
It's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1622
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:58,330
...all the time.

1623
02:41:59,903 --> 02:42:01,894
Can you understand?

1624
02:42:04,908 --> 02:42:07,809
Yes, John, I think I can.

1625
02:42:10,247 --> 02:42:13,546
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1626
02:42:15,819 --> 02:42:17,753
There must be something that you want.

1627
02:42:27,264 --> 02:42:31,701
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1628
02:42:32,269 --> 02:42:34,328
Heaven

1629
02:42:34,605 --> 02:42:36,698
I'm in heaven

1630
02:42:37,674 --> 02:42:42,441
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

1631
02:42:44,348 --> 02:42:49,115
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek

1632
02:42:50,787 --> 02:42:55,554
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1633
02:43:57,688 --> 02:44:00,054
Why, they's angels.

1634
02:44:01,024 --> 02:44:03,618
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1635
02:45:04,354 --> 02:45:06,288
I'll be all right, fellas.

1636
02:45:07,758 --> 02:45:09,953
This here's the hard part.

1637
02:45:11,328 --> 02:45:12,795
I'll be all right in a while.

1638
02:45:15,666 --> 02:45:18,464
I should have this just for now.

1639
02:45:22,539 --> 02:45:24,905
I'll give it back after.

1640
02:45:28,045 --> 02:45:32,539
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1641
02:45:33,850 --> 02:45:35,841
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1642
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:38,246
Did you, John?

1643
02:45:39,122 --> 02:45:43,456
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1644
02:45:43,727 --> 02:45:45,957
That Mouseville place.

1645
02:45:46,296 --> 02:45:48,560
I dreamed there's kids.

1646
02:45:49,199 --> 02:45:52,566
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1647
02:45:55,138 --> 02:45:58,869
I dreamed that those two little
blonde-headed girls was there.

1648
02:45:59,142 --> 02:46:00,939
They's laughing too.

1649
02:46:01,211 --> 02:46:04,078
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1650
02:46:04,348 --> 02:46:08,341
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1651
02:46:08,652 --> 02:46:11,917
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1652
02:46:13,490 --> 02:46:16,857
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1653
02:46:35,178 --> 02:46:39,171
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1654
02:46:41,184 --> 02:46:43,152
I can feel it.

1655
02:46:43,487 --> 02:46:45,079
It's like bees stinging me.

1656
02:46:45,522 --> 02:46:47,820
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1657
02:46:49,192 --> 02:46:50,284
We don't hate you.

1658
02:46:51,795 --> 02:46:53,285
Can you feel that?

1659
02:46:55,599 --> 02:46:57,692
IKill him twice, you boys!

1660
02:46:58,535 --> 02:47:02,471
You go on and kill that raping
babykiller twice!

1661
02:47:02,739 --> 02:47:04,502
That'd be fine!

1662
02:47:21,258 --> 02:47:23,658
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1663
02:47:23,927 --> 02:47:25,155
Yes, sir.

1664
02:47:37,507 --> 02:47:38,496
Roll on one.

1665
02:47:46,583 --> 02:47:50,019
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1666
02:47:50,921 --> 02:47:53,116
I hope it hurts like hell.

1667
02:47:55,158 --> 02:47:57,626
John Coffey, you've been condemned
to die in the electric chair...

1668
02:47:57,928 --> 02:47:59,122
...by a jury of your peers.

1669
02:47:59,429 --> 02:48:02,762
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1670
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:06,463
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1671
02:48:08,271 --> 02:48:10,739
I'm sorry for what I am.

1672
02:48:22,819 --> 02:48:24,446
Please, boss...

1673
02:48:25,956 --> 02:48:28,584
...don't put that thing over my face.

1674
02:48:29,860 --> 02:48:32,124
Don't put me in the dark.

1675
02:48:32,963 --> 02:48:35,227
I's afraid of the dark.

1676
02:48:44,975 --> 02:48:46,567
All right, John.

1677
02:49:06,830 --> 02:49:09,799
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1678
02:49:10,066 --> 02:49:12,830
Heaven, heaven

1679
02:49:13,103 --> 02:49:14,866
I'm in heaven

1680
02:49:15,505 --> 02:49:18,030
Heaven, heaven

1681
02:49:18,341 --> 02:49:19,968
I'm in heaven

1682
02:49:40,964 --> 02:49:42,488
John Coffey...

1683
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:46,660
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1684
02:49:46,937 --> 02:49:49,030
...in accordance with state law.

1685
02:49:51,474 --> 02:49:55,137
May God have mercy on your soul.

1686
02:50:33,917 --> 02:50:35,817
You have to say it.

1687
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:39,750
You have to give the order.

1688
02:50:57,841 --> 02:51:00,071
He killed them with they love.

1689
02:51:00,343 --> 02:51:05,076
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1690
02:51:18,962 --> 02:51:20,327
Roll on two.

1691
02:53:05,068 --> 02:53:08,367
It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1692
02:53:08,738 --> 02:53:12,401
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1693
02:53:13,643 --> 02:53:18,239
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1694
02:53:18,581 --> 02:53:20,242
It was all right.

1695
02:53:21,017 --> 02:53:23,884
"Catch them young" became my motto.

1696
02:53:27,157 --> 02:53:28,181
You don't believe me.

1697
02:53:29,159 --> 02:53:31,593
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1698
02:53:32,495 --> 02:53:34,588
- It's just that...
- It's quite a story.

1699
02:53:34,864 --> 02:53:37,025
It's quite a story.

1700
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,798
One thing I don't understand.

1701
02:53:40,103 --> 02:53:41,798
You said you and Jan...

1702
02:53:42,105 --> 02:53:45,597
...had a grown son in 1935.

1703
02:53:45,942 --> 02:53:47,375
Is that right?

1704
02:53:47,811 --> 02:53:49,711
The math doesn't work, does it?

1705
02:53:55,451 --> 02:53:57,976
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1706
02:54:18,708 --> 02:54:20,073
Watch your step.

1707
02:54:20,643 --> 02:54:22,907
Now let your eyes adjust.

1708
02:54:34,824 --> 02:54:35,756
There.

1709
02:54:39,662 --> 02:54:41,323
Wake up, old fella.

1710
02:54:41,664 --> 02:54:42,858
Wake up.

1711
02:54:46,502 --> 02:54:50,302
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1712
02:54:54,577 --> 02:54:55,839
Come over here, boy.

1713
02:54:56,412 --> 02:54:58,710
Come on over here and see this lady.

1714
02:55:01,684 --> 02:55:04,619
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1715
02:55:27,377 --> 02:55:29,902
Go on, you can do it.

1716
02:55:37,086 --> 02:55:41,455
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1717
02:55:42,325 --> 02:55:46,227
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1718
02:55:52,735 --> 02:55:56,330
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1719
02:55:56,839 --> 02:56:01,640
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1720
02:56:01,911 --> 02:56:04,209
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1721
02:56:04,514 --> 02:56:07,847
And I think a part of...

1722
02:56:08,184 --> 02:56:10,709
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1723
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:14,351
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1724
02:56:15,591 --> 02:56:17,525
As for me...

1725
02:56:18,761 --> 02:56:21,252
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1726
02:56:21,597 --> 02:56:23,690
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1727
02:56:24,100 --> 02:56:27,467
...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1728
02:56:29,939 --> 02:56:32,100
When John did that...

1729
02:56:33,609 --> 02:56:35,873
...when he took my hand...

1730
02:56:36,946 --> 02:56:40,780
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1731
02:56:41,784 --> 02:56:43,547
...spilled into me.

1732
02:56:44,020 --> 02:56:45,783
He... what?

1733
02:56:46,289 --> 02:56:49,725
He infected you with life?

1734
02:56:51,394 --> 02:56:53,658
It's as good a word as any.

1735
02:56:55,231 --> 02:56:58,064
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1736
02:56:58,334 --> 02:56:59,733
With life.

1737
02:57:03,873 --> 02:57:06,899
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

1738
02:57:07,210 --> 02:57:11,476
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1739
02:57:14,484 --> 02:57:18,147
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1740
02:57:18,488 --> 02:57:22,948
He was just a force of nature.

1741
02:57:23,493 --> 02:57:27,623
I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1742
02:57:28,731 --> 02:57:31,632
Another century come to pass.

1743
02:57:34,437 --> 02:57:38,840
But I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1744
02:57:39,275 --> 02:57:41,266
Hal and Melinda...

1745
02:57:41,778 --> 02:57:43,143
...Brutus Howell...

1746
02:57:43,379 --> 02:57:46,007
...my wife, my boy.

1747
02:57:49,052 --> 02:57:50,815
And you, Elaine.

1748
02:57:51,888 --> 02:57:53,617
You'll die too.

1749
02:57:55,191 --> 02:57:59,525
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1750
02:58:01,030 --> 02:58:03,396
It's my atonement, you see.

1751
02:58:04,033 --> 02:58:05,694
It's my punishment...

1752
02:58:05,968 --> 02:58:08,528
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1753
02:58:10,306 --> 02:58:13,002
For killing a miracle of God.

1754
02:58:14,610 --> 02:58:17,272
Almighty, everlasting God...

1755
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:20,012
...the source of all being and life.

1756
02:58:20,316 --> 02:58:24,514
You'll be gone like all the others.
I'll have to stay.

1757
02:58:26,622 --> 02:58:30,752
I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1758
02:58:31,561 --> 02:58:35,497
I have no illusions of immortality.

1759
02:58:35,932 --> 02:58:38,366
But I will have wished for death...

1760
02:58:39,135 --> 02:58:41,262
...long before death finds me.

1761
02:58:42,438 --> 02:58:46,204
In truth, I wish for it already.

1762
02:58:58,354 --> 02:59:00,288
Mr. Jingles?

1763
02:59:09,332 --> 02:59:11,425
Where you been?

1764
02:59:11,934 --> 02:59:15,131
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1765
02:59:16,038 --> 02:59:18,404
Let's see if we can find you
something to eat.

1766
02:59:19,609 --> 02:59:23,272
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1767
02:59:24,780 --> 02:59:26,042
Look at you.

1768
02:59:27,817 --> 02:59:31,651
I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1769
02:59:31,921 --> 02:59:33,855
And I wait.

1770
02:59:34,857 --> 02:59:37,519
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1771
02:59:37,793 --> 02:59:39,886
...now long gone.

1772
02:59:40,696 --> 02:59:43,062
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1773
02:59:43,332 --> 02:59:46,301
...how I lost her so many years ago.

1774
02:59:47,737 --> 02:59:52,299
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1775
02:59:52,575 --> 02:59:55,169
...each in our own time.

1776
02:59:56,312 --> 02:59:59,406
But one thought
more than any other...

1777
02:59:59,682 --> 03:00:02,276
...keeps me awake most nights:

1778
03:00:03,519 --> 03:00:07,421
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1779
03:00:07,990 --> 03:00:10,982
...how much longer do I have?

1780
03:00:14,363 --> 03:00:17,059
We each owe a death.

1781
03:00:17,333 --> 03:00:19,767
There are no exceptions.

1782
03:00:20,603 --> 03:00:22,537
But, oh, God...

1783
03:00:23,506 --> 03:00:25,235
...sometimes...

1784
03:00:25,908 --> 03:00:29,400
...the Green Mile seems so long.
