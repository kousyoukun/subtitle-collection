00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,833
They figured out
we're not aid workers.

00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,458
<i>Three klicks from the ridge.
Two cars in pursuit. Possible RPG.</i>

3
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,541
Don't let them line up a shot!

4
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,166
Moving into position now.

5
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,458
In position.

6
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,041
I have visual. Spider?
I have a shot.

7
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,583
Let her rip. We are ready to boogie.

8
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,333
What was that?
It's a trap! Shooters on the ridge!

9
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,500
Hit the other driver!
They're lining up the shot!

10
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Shoot the truck!

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,041
Let's go
before the others come.

12
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,541
The truck is empty.

13
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,541
Driver's dead.
Other guy is gone.

14
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,541
Grab the gun.
I'll look around.

15
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,500
Come on, work!

16

17
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,708

19
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,708
<i>Parker, we are approaching the vehicle.
What's your status?</i>

20
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,666
I'm sorry, Nick.

21
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,416
- I volunteered to tell the family.
- I'll come with.

22
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,333
No, I got it.

23
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,958
- Adam, no!

24
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,875
Parker!

25
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,583
What are you doing?!

26
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,916
Hey! Stop it!

27
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,500
Enough! Parker!

28
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
It's over! It's over!

29
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,708
<i>Unbelievable.

You can't solve
every problem with a knife.

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,291
Should I just have let him
murder assets?

32
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,583
How does he think
we're going to get information from them

33
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,750
if he keeps killing them all? Hmm?

34
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,291
I don't think the boy thinks.

<i>♪ Pull it out push it in... ♪</i>

36

Adam requested that you be

37
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,625

40
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,500

- I'm not gonna get caught.

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,916

42
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,375
I deleted the request.

43
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,916
"Thank you, Spider!"
"You're so welcome, Parker."

44
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,333
Hmm. That's how that should've gone.

45
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,250
You read my emails?

- No, I do not read your emails.
- Mm-hmm.

But that's only because you need to learn

- Now, you have too much spam, girl.

49
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,833
You got more spam
than a Hawaiian middle school in there.

00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,833
Yo, what's that?

52
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,541

Hey, Parker. How you doing?

54
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,833
Hey, um, it's not really a great time.

55
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,125
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

56
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,875
So...

57
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,875
Listen, there was a cave-in
at the mine last night.

58
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,666
And your dad got caught underneath it.

59
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,500
And by the time we found him,
it was too late.

60
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,666
{\an8}Hi.

61
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,583
{\an8}Hi.

62
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,125
I'm just, uh...

63
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,458
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around all of this.

64
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,958
I've been thinking that maybe there's

65
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,208
some kind of poetry or something

66
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:17,083
in the fact that he was swallowed up
in his favorite place.

67
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,791
He loved that damn cave.

68
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,125
What's that?

69
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,625
Found it on his desk
in the bedroom.

70
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,125
Well, it's a letter. Why is it evidence?

71
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,250
Well, I'm wondering if it, uh...

72
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,000
if it could have been on purpose.

73
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,875
The cave-in, I mean.

74
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,750
You think this is a suicide note?

75
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,000
This is... It's just a letter.

76
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,916
I mean, we would write
each other sometimes. It's not a--

77
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,500
It's not evidence for anything.
It's just a letter.

78
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,708
All right. Uh... How did he sound
the last time you two spoke?

79
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,916
Lonely? I don't know.

80
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,458
He missed me.

81
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,875
We... We missed each other.
We always miss each other.

82
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,250
He's not that guy.

83
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,375
I mean, it was an old mine,
a really old mine,

84
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,000
and old mines have cave-ins all the time.

85
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,291
Right. No. You... You...
You're right. I'm sorry.

86
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,750
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,583
Hands are sweating. I... I don't know.

88
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,250
It's fine. It's...

89
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,458
Um...

90
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,916
Can I give you a ride home?

91
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
- Yeah, I... I need a ride.
- Yeah, I'm gonna give you a ride home. Um...

92
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,958
Let me grab my keys.

re-election campaign going?

96
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,250
Uh, uh, it's going.

97
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,958
Think one of your dad's rich donor friends

98
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,000
would be interested in buying Maria's?

99
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,000
Seriously?

100
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,250
Yeah.

101
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,333
But Harry built Maria's for you.

102
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,250
You don't want to stay and run the bar?

103
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't stay.
I'm gonna leave after the funeral.

104
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,958
It just doesn't feel like home
without Pops here.

105
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,208
You want me to help you
take these upstairs?

106
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,250
Oh, no, it's... it's fine. I'm okay.

107
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,000
All right.

108
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,166
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I'll, uh...

109
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll let you get settled in, then.

110
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,333
Okay.

111
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,250
You need me, just holler. Okay?

112
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,458
Thanks.

113
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,041
Cheers, Pops.

114
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,625
Oh jeez! I'm here to feed the lizard!
Please don't kill me!

115
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,166
Mikey?

116
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,666
Parker?

117
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,083
Ugh.

118
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,583
Jesus.

119
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,500
You all right?

120
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,958
No! No, I almost shit myself.

121
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,166
Sorry about that.

122
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,541
No, it's good to see you.

123
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,416
Now, uh, where's that lizard?

124
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,083
Uh, Andy, come on out, buddy.
It's dinnertime.

125
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,666
Does he usually come
when you call?

126
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,000
No.

127
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,041
Hmm.

128
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,916
Uh, Harry was really proud of you.

129
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,958
He always talked about it.

130
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,750
How you... were killing terrorists,
doing spy shit.

131
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,666
I don't know, whatever you're doing.

132
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,916
Do you know where they found him?

133
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,375
I found him, actually.

134
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh man. Mikey, I'm sorry.

135
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,833
Will you show me?

136
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,625
Is that a camera?

137
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,791
Yeah, yeah.
Harry, uh, stepped up security lately.

138
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,833
He actually got real cameras this time.
Not like the fake ones in the bar.

139
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,125
So I saw a lot of dust
coming out of the mine.

140
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,791
Uh...

141
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:47,041
It was crazy. It was so thick that I could
barely see my hand in front of my face.

142
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,000
Couldn't find him anywhere.

143
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,791
I was, uh... I was worried,
really worried something happened to him.

144
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,666
He'd just been spending
so much more time down here.

145
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,583
Why?

146
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,416
I don't know.

147
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,041
<i>This knife
protected your</i> abuelo<i>.</i>

148
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,458
It got me through Vietnam.
It's part of our legacy.

149
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,791
Look at how tall you've gotten.

150
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,000
It's done.

151
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,958
I need you to sharpen this
when we go back.

152
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,625
Never carry a knife without...

153
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,500
Without sharpening it.

154
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,500
Hey.

155
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,958
- Parker.
Huh?

156
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,958
It's over here.

157
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,541
It took me like an hour
to feel my way over here.

158
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,500
At first, I... I was worried
he was trapped on the other side.

159
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,916
So I was... I was yelling for him,
and then, uh--

160
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,125
And then I saw the... the blood.

161
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,791
I didn't know rocks
could come down like that. Scary shit.

162
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,791
You okay?

163
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,666
Yeah, it's just...

164
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,833
What is that?

165
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,166
Did Pops mention

166
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,875
opening the tunnel more?

167
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't... I don't know.

168
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,916
Why?

169
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,125
Huh.

170
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,208
Look at these pockmarks.

171
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,083
Uh, yeah, what about it?

172
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,791
Think you can, uh, do something
about the power?

173
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,000
Uh, yeah, let me see what I can do.

174
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,375
Okay.

175
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,291
<i>This place is incredible.</i>

176
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,916
Imagine people come in,
getting some of our family's recipes.

177
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,750
Sitting with your neighbors,
enjoying each other.

178
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,416
- What name should we give it?
- We should name it after Grandma.

179
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:57,708
Maria's.

180
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,166
All right, boss.

181
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,500
Maria's it is.

182
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,416
So, uh, guess you're
my new boss now, right?

183
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,375
- Till I sell the place, yeah.
- Oh.

184
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,958
Figured you were taking it over.
You know, he always talked about it.

185
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,291
Nah. I gotta get back to work.

186
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,708
Well, if you're interested in keeping it,
you know I could always run it for you.

187
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,958
We could turn a profit.

188
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,750
- Not a big one, but--
- Cover your ears!

189
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,666
- Why? Is that the grenade?

190
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,000
Parker...
...what the hell was that about?

191
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,375
- I have a question, Mike.
Yeah.

192
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:51,041
I believe that that mine collapse happened
because of one of these grenades.

193
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,583
- Okay.
- See the pockmarks in the rocks? The same.

194
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,083
But my father was a Green Beret,

195
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,958
and he knew how to handle explosives.

196
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,541
So what happened?

197
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,916
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe he forgot he pulled the pin.

198
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,666
That's not possible.

199
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,000
It... It might be.

200
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,125
Okay? He was, uh...
he was getting forgetful.

201
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,208
What do you mean forgetful?

202
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,458
Like, you know,
he was... he was getting old.

203
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,541
He was just forgetting shit.

204
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,333
Pops never mentioned it.

205
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,541
Well, he's probably
just trying not to worry you.

206
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,166
Plus, we all take care of each other here.

207
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,208
Like, when this place was hit,

208
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,666
people were here
in like 30 minutes boarding it up.

209
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,791
Well, I'm gonna get another.

210
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:41,750
Do you want one?

211
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,333
Yeah. Here, twist my arm.

212
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,666
Okay.

213
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh.

214
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,291

215
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,416
Hey, Parker.

216
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,458
I'm getting a refill.

217
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,291
- Help yourself.
Thank you.

218
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,458
Yo, Mo.

219
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,375
Yo!
- Can we get another round over here?

220
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,125
Yes, sir, just give me one second.

No girl was ever good enough

- Mm-hmm.

248
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:13,916
Such a flirt.

249
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:27,958
Hold up.

250
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,833
What? It's a busted up car.

251
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,125
Jesse ever arrest the people
that knocked over this place?

252
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,458
No difference. Some assholes
robbed Frank's trailer last week.

253
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,208
Gas station got hit a month ago.

Hmm.

255
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,375
Got people staring at us.

256
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,291
People can suck it.

257
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,916
- How do you like that? That was...

258
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,708
- That was pretty. Yeah.
- That was smooth as hell.

259
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,208
- Oh man.
Mike, let's sit for a sec.

260
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,666
I just want to keep an eye on that truck.

261
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,041
It's... stolen.

262
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,083
Truck you were looking in?
Mm-hmm.

263
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:11,166
Okay, well, if it's stolen, you want me
to call Jesse? He'll take care of it.

264
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,375
Not yet.

265
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,541
- Start the car.

266

268
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,291
Leave one car distance
between us and them, okay?

269
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,750
Fuck, okay, it feels weird.

270
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,250
You know, what if they just drive
a busted-up car?

271
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,750
And now we're... we're being Karens,
we're following them.

272
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,458
We are not being Karens.

273
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,458
They had a machine gun
in the back of their car.

274
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,625
A machine gun?
Where would you even get a machine gun?

275
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,375
It's not easy.

276
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,791
Holy shit.
Yup.

277
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,541
Now, my friend, you can call Jesse.

278
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:04,250
Okay, I'm going to call--
Where are you going? Parker!

279
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,291
What the hell are you doing?! Shit.

280
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,125
Any other cash in here?

281
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,875
You got a safe? Huh?

282
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:38,166
Hey, yo, yo, see if there's a safe.

283
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,375
Come on! Let's go.

284
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,250
They held me at gunpoint
and took it right off my wrist.

285
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:43,125
You know, my dad gave me this watch
when I graduated high school.

286
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,916
I can't believe you found it.

287
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,125
And you remembered
it was mine after all these years?

288
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,041
Yeah.

289
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:58,291
I'm sorry about Harry,
but I'm glad you're home, kid.

290
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,041
Huh.

291
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,125
Maybe this'll work.

292
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,625
Whoa!

293
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,208

Ah. Load me up.

297
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,458

298
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:00,833
- All right. Three, two, one! Fire!
- This is the one.

299
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,708

Whoa!

300
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,333

302
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,666
Are they just giving out
military weapons now?

303
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,833

- Hey. Is this a bad time?

304
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,541
<i>Nah, for you, never.
No, I'm just walking to the car.</i>

305
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,916

307
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,875
You know, home.

309
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,375
Small-time cloud storage

310

<i>Think you can break into it?</i>

311
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:11,125
Who are you talking to?
Of course I can break into it. Why?

312
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,416
<i>I found a link to it
with some of my dad's stuff.</i>

314
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,958
Uh-huh. Should we, uh,
I don't know, take a look-see?

315
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:23,333
- Yes, please.
- You know <i>the deal. Shoot me that link.</i>

316
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,500
<i>I already did.</i>

00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,291
<i>All right. I am in.</i>

318
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:32,666

319
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:36,000

00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,416
Yeah, now I see where you get
all your chaotic storage vibes from.

322
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:46,250
I mean, it's a lot of footage here, P,
but no organizational system.

323
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,833
<i>Can you go to the day he died?</i>

324
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,500
<i>- It's two Thursdays ago.</i>
- I mean, that's gonna be a minute.

325
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,458
It's a lot of footage, and I gotta go
file by file, check every single one.

326
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:56,458
Let me see if I can get an intern
to write a program for you. Hold up. Okay.

327
00:28:56,458 --> 00:29:00,291
I see, uh, some footage of a monster truck
with some flames on the side.

328
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,458
<i>- Any idea who that could be?</i>
- Is it black?

329
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,041
<i>- That's the one.</i>
- Yeah.

330
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:08,333
Elvis Swann, two n's.

331
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,083
<i>He's a total dipshit.</i>

332
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,750
<i>His dad is a senator.</i>

333
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,791
<i>I actually caught him messing around
with an RPG on my property earlier.</i>

334
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:19,208
- Any idea why he'd be in the mine?
<i>- Pops had it set up like a living room.</i>

335
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,541
<i>He had a stash there.</i>

336
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,083
<i>Booze, old records, movies.</i>

337
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,958
Oh shit. Your pops
had an actual man cave in a real cave?

338
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah.

339
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,458
<i>- </i>  Mmm.
<i>- Oh, other hobbies.</i>

340
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:34,083
<i>Your boy Elvis watches a lot of porn.</i>

341
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,708
Uh, looks like
he's on the dark web a lot too.

342
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,125
<i>Really? Doing what?</i>

343
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:42,250
It looks like selling some M16s,
Sig Sauers, MK13s.

344
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,833
All this stuff's still active service.

345
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:48,041
I mean, they've got to be stolen.
Any mention of grenades?

346
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,458
Don't see any grenades.
It's probably a hard sell these days.

347
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:54,375
I swear, if he had anything
to do with that cave-in, I will kill him.

348
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,000
Hey, P, get proof first.

349
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,916
<i>Trail him a bit. Track him.
I'll call you when I have something.</i>

350
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,750
<i>You good otherwise?</i>

351
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,375
<i>I'm always good.</i>

352
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,916
Shit.

353
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,875
Hey.
- Oh, what's up, fool?

354
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,208
Parker?

355
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, what a treat!
Hey.

356
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,291
Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

357
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,500
Don't mind the hands.
I'm getting a bird ready.

358
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,833
- No worries.
- Do you want a beer?

359
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,166
- Of course I do.
- All I've got's light.

360
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,541
Yeah, I'll take a beer too, please.

361
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,250
Sorry, you're out.

362
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,333
Mom, you didn't get beer?

363
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,500
So, Georgia, since you
kind of have your ear to the ground,

364
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,541
what have you heard
about Elvis other than,

365
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:33,541
you know, being a piece of shit?

366
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,083
He's the same old entitled you-know-what,

367
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:41,333
selling drugs to Allen's kids,
riding around Quinnie's lot drunk.

368
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:44,666
Still hanging with, uh, Beck and Mickey?

369
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,625
Mm-hmm.

370
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:49,458
Wow, those guys haven't been arrested yet.

371
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,791
Well, who's gonna arrest him, Parker?
Jesse? I mean, come on.

372
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:53,791
Touché.

373
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,666
Elvis got them jobs at the Army depot.

374
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,125
I can't imagine
what they're doing there though.

375
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,125
Not making this town any safer.

376
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,000
You hear anything
about Elvis and guns, Mikey?

377
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,541
Uh, I don't know.

378
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,458
Um...

379
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:12,291
Matter of fact, yeah. He tried to sell
an AK, uh, to my buddy Trench.

380
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,500
- Tried to trade him for his dirt bike.
- No.

381
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,625
- Yeah.
- Where'd he get an AK from?

382
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,166
- Uh... Walmart.
Mmm.

383
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,916
- Think they're having a sale.
- Funny.

384
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
'Sup, hot stuff?

385
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:36,541
<i>Your boy Elvis has an exchange
set for this afternoon at his place.</i>

386
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,333
- Really?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

387
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,625
<i>And I assume you've snuck into
a window or two in your youth.</i>

388
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,416
Your assumptions are correct.

389
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:47,250
<i>I wonder what you think
about that, Senator Swann.</i>

390
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,458
<i>I've never felt
more unsafe in my own country.</i>

391
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:53,458
<i>In an effort to be progressive,
Washington has stopped protecting us.</i>

392
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:57,416
<i>When I'm re-elected,
I will continue to fight for our values.</i>

393
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,958
<i>Freedom, family, and faith.</i>

394
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,666
<i>I am Creation through and through.</i>

395
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:06,250
<i>Swann residence.</i>
We're here to see Elvis.

396
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,333
<i>Come on in, boys.</i>

397
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,500
<i>I couldn't agree more,
Senator Swann.</i>

398
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,125
<i>Thank you, and God bless.</i>

399
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,750
<i>God bless America.</i>

400
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,375
A little more party, huh?

401
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,541
A little more party.

402
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,208
Okay, boys.

403
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,833
I got this one right here.

404
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,833
Since day one, baby!

405
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,166
Yeah, I'll take all of these.

406
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,750
Great, great.

407
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,666
Rumor has it you might have access
to something a little bigger.

408
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,958
How much bigger
are we talking about?

409
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,958
I'm looking for RPGs.

410
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:58,166
Ah... I'll have to talk
to my connect about that.

411
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,375
See what I can, uh... See what I can do.

412
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,750
You get me five RPGs,
and I'll have half a mil

413
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,041
in your bank account
by the end of next week.

414
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,416
Yeah, I think we can figure something out.

415
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,666
Anybody can defend America
against foreign threats.

416
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,291
Oh really?
Mm-hmm.

417
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,583
But how many people can defend
Quinnie's new herd from meth heads?

418
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,833
- I think you should quit.

419
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:28,250
Move back home, come on as my deputy.

420
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,666
I think you just miss me.

421
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:33,416
You think?
Yeah.

422
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:35,083
- Hey, Parker.

423
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,083
Hey, Dad.

424
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,250
Senator.

425
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,750
I see you two old lovebirds.

426
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,291
How is being back?

427
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,625
Um...

428
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,291
- Good.
- Yeah?

429
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,500
I see your campaign is, uh, going well.

430
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,583
You're on all the billboards,
and I hear your ads on the radio.

431
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:06,375
Mm-hmm.
- Very passionate.

432
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,166
Nah, that's some bullshit.
Power over policy, right?

433
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,333
That's what people want, Parker.

434
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,625
We have got to have her over the house
one of these nights, huh?

435
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,125
Catch up, right?

436
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,541
I mean, I would get
drips and drabs from my son here.

437
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:30,000
Sure.

438
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,416
Yeah?

439
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,916
Well, how about this weekend?

440
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,041
You'll come too, Jesse.

441
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,708
Anyway, I gotta get back to the office.

442
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,916
It's good to see you.

443
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:44,833
Have fun.

444
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:54,916
God, I feel like
I've been shot back to high school,

445
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,083
like I should be
worried about sneaking off

446
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,250
before Harry's done with last call.

447
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,916
Remember that time
I tried sneaking out the window,

448
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,166
and he was in the parking lot
with his friends?

449
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,041
And he said, "Jesse, what've you been
doing these days, other than my daughter?"

450
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:19,750
Yeah.

451
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,708
I thought I was dead,

452
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,041
till he started laughing.

453
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,208
He liked you.

454
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,166
He liked messing with me.

455
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,458
Same thing.

456
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,208
He didn't kill himself, Jesse.

457
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,500
You know that, right?

458
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,375
Well, he hadn't been himself lately.

459
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:53,500
You know, he was...
getting more and more confused.

460
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,833
It's not like any of us were worried
about him being home alone or anything.

461
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,750
It was just that sometimes he would...

462
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,583
...you know.

463
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,333
I know. Mike told me.

464
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:13,583
So you think he killed himself
because he was forgetful?

465
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,208
That's not a thing.

466
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,708
When are you gonna release the body?

467
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,291
Uh, tomorrow.

468
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:32,833
I told them to prepare him for cremation
so you can have the funeral.

469
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:36,583
And we're ruling it an accident.

470
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,958
Good, because it was.

471
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,666
It was an accident.

472
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:45,083
Is there anything I can do?

473
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:48,916
I wanna help.

474
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,083
That's very generous of you.

475
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:45,750
It's Roberto.

476
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:15,541
He's gonna make me go
back to AA, I guess.

477
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,791
Better than getting a divorce.

478
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,875
Ugh.

479
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:59,208
Everyone in town knows
I'm not racist.

480
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,125
Hmm.

481
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,583
In fact, my great-grandfather

482
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,291
was a Native American.

483
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:07,666
Oh really?

484
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,625
Yeah.
- What tribe?

485
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,875
Yeah, I don't know.

486
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,625
But it's where I get
my lactose intolerance from.

487
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:17,458
You're funny.

488
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,083
You know, people see a white guy

489
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:24,125
spouting conservative talking points
in this climate and they shut down.

490
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,000
Never mind that most Latinos
are conservative.

491
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,625
You know, people like you
around here, Parker.

492
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,250
They like Harry, or liked him.

493
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,375
- If I could get an endorsement from you--
Oh, hey, careful, Dad.

494
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,666
You blow her ego up too much,
she's gonna end up running against you.

495
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:50,041
Now there's a question
I wanted to ask you. Uh...

496
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,416
How am I supposed to say that, that, uh...
that "Latinx"?

497
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,250
How do I say it? Is it Latinx or...

498
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,166
It's great.
The way you're saying it, it's great.

499
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,666
- Oh, is that right?
Mm-hmm.

500
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:07,125
Well, can I be honest with you?

501
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,208
Please.

502
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:09,958
I don't understand it at all.

503
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:12,166
Latinx.

504
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,041
- I gotta go.
You can't stay for a minute?

505
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:27,208
No, no. It's a... It's a work emergency.

506
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,083
Let's do this again.

507
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:56,666
That's a shitload of rocks.
Going to be clearing them all night.

508
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:01,000
The Swanns need to pay us
for this shit.

509
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,291
How long before she's back?

510
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:51,041
Wow, I guess this spic
really loved Chuck Norris.

511
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:53,416
We should take those back with us.

512
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,500
This is my favorite part.

513
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,000
Come on, Elvis, get up.
This is your mess.

514
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:03,083
Mm-hmm.

515
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,375
Get out of his chair!

516
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,958
- Oh shit!

517
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,833
- You did it, didn't you? Didn't you?
- What?

518
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,583
- Help!
Elvis?

519
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,291
Shit!

520
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,541
Walk. Now!

521
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,000
Do what she says. Go!

522
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:37,333
Go on, go! Come on, get to it!

523
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,041
- Shit. No! Oh.

524
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,166
Hey, hey.

525
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,125
- I didn't kill Harry, okay?
- I don't want to hear it!

526
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:02,750
What do you think's gonna happen?
My brother's gonna come and arrest me? Ah!

527
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,500
Ow, don't do that!

528
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:09,791
What makes you think
he doesn't already know I'm here?

529
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,125
Huh?

530
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,500
Oh God, Maria's!

531
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,041
No! Stop!

532
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:24,833
Please, stop!

533
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,416
Fucking bitch!

534
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,333
Mickey, stop!

535
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:38,750
Come back here!

536
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,500
Come out here, bitch!

537
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:29,750
Come on, Elvis, get in.

538
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,875
Get it goin'! Come on!

539
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:50,708
Elvis!

540
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,250
Oh shit!

541
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:55,791
Let's go. Come on!

542
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:58,166
The tires are flat.

543
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,583
What the fuck?

544
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,000
You killed Pops.

545
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,458
- You killed him, didn't you?
- Hey, get off him.

546
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:11,208
You smuggled guns through the tunnels,
and he caught you.

547
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,791
I said get the hell off him!

548
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:18,541
Parker, stop it!
Get off him! You're gonna kill him!

549
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,125
Admit it! Admit it, Elvis!

550
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,583
Calm down,
or I'm gonna have to arrest you.

551
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,375
He murdered Pops!

552
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,416
I'm gonna kill him!

553
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,708
You told me you stopped.

554
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,125
Right. Oh...

555
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:55,958
You don't know how much they were offering
for just a couple of these missiles, so...

556
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:57,875
Who are these people?

557
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:01,750
I don't know. They're...
They're people from the fucking Internet.

558
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,375
Fucking motherfucker!
- Boys! Come on, quit it. Quit it!

559
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,083
You're the worst thing
that's happened to this place.

560
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:11,416
You know that?

561
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,583
Selling goddamn stolen guns
on the dark web,

562
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,916
drawing every type
of nasty person to our town!

563
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,708
All this crime is a win.

564
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,458
It's a win!

565
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:26,583
You're the sheriff of the town.
You get to play hero.

566
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,958
Dad looks generous.

567
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:32,791
It's saving his fucking career, man.
I mean, you guys should be thanking me.

568
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:34,583
Goddamn it.

569
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,666
If you'd just kept her at the dinner,
none of this shit would've happened.

570
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:42,791
Everything would've been fine. She would
be having a nice meal, enjoying herself

571
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:45,250
while we cleared out the cave
and got the fucking missiles!

572
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,500
You could've at least told me
what the goddamn plan was.

573
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,666
- Supposed to tell you everything?
- You're supposed to--

574
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,416
Enough!

575
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,666
Enough!

576
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,125
How much does Parker know about this?

577
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:03,458
Too much.

578
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:07,708
You gotta clean this up.

579
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:38,958
I got good news for you.

580
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,833
My dad found a buyer
for the five acres around Maria's.

581
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:49,166
They're willing to give you
three million for it, as is.

582
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:53,916
Five million.

583
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,333
Just take the money
and go back to your life.

584
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:01,625
How... involved are you?

585
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:08,708
Was our whole thing
supposed to be... a distraction?

586
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,083
No. No.

587
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,125
You let me think he killed himself.

588
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,416
What are you doing?

589
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,833
There's footage of their bullshit.

590
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:25,375
The best thing you can do
is turn yourself and them in.

591
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,208
The cameras in the bar are fake.

592
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,791
He put real ones outside.

593
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,333
I'll need to see them, then.

594
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,250
Oh really?

595
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,375
Not before my lawyer does.

596
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,583
Thanks for coming out all this way.

597
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:54,916
Anything for Spider.

598
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,166
- Luis Torres.
- Parker.

599
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:59,208
- Pleasure to meet you, Parker.
- You too.

600
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:02,708
Can you, uh, excuse us?

601
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah, I'll be in my office.

602
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,666
You're being held
for assaulting Elvis,

603
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,458
but they also found a body at Maria's.

604
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:15,291
Sheriff.

605
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,916
Wonder if I could ask a few questions.

606
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:21,875
- Yeah, sure. Sit.
Thank you.

607
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:28,458
Sheriff, the men Parker caught
robbing the feed store last week,

608
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,083
they're still in the hospital, yes?

609
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:32,875
Mm-hmm. Are they relevant to all this?

610
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,041
No, just doing my due diligence.

611
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,416
Your brother, Elvis,

612
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:40,208
he's employed by your father, yes?

613
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,875
- In a limited capacity.
- Which is what?

614
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,250
I stay out of it.

615
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,083
All right.

616
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:53,541
Well, that's all I got for right now.
Thank you for your hospitality.

617
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:52,416
Sheriff?

618
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,541
Oh, don't you want to be
done with this, Parker?

619
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,666
Come on.

620
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,125
Just give us the security tapes.

621
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:15,166
You know, if you, uh... if you

622
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,166
pivot on that back foot,

623
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:21,375
you won't punch like such a little bitch.

624
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,875
Maybe she's full of shit.

625
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,708
There is no security footage.

626
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:32,000
Harry had no fucking idea
what he was talking about half the time.

627
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,250
Fucking--

628
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,666
Parker, please.

629
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,291
You can make this stop.

630
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,500
So could you.

631
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:48,166
Why don't you
just tell us what's on the tape,

632
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:51,375
and then we'll give you
a little water and some food,

633
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:54,458
and you know,
take those little cuffs off for a while.

634
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:58,250
- No, I'm good. I'm good. I like it here.
Yeah?

635
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,750
You wanna know
what really happened to Harry?

636
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,083
Dad.

637
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,750
Look, I'm working with the hand I got.

638
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,250
Let's make a trade.

639
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,291
Okay.

640
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,500
It's with a friend of mine.

641
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,208
I need to call
and tell him where to send it.

642
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,916
Come on.

643
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:28,416
What?

644
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:32,500
If you tell her too much now,
it fucks everything.

645
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,291
Well, we can keep busting her ass.

646
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:37,000
- I mean, either way it's on her.
You've gotta call this off.

647
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,166
The fuck?
Who are these people?

648
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:53,958
If you try anything...

649
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,041
you understand
what's gonna happen to you, yes?

650
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:00,291
What's his number?

651
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,125
202...

652
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,500
555-1227.

653
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,208
Tell him it's Parker,
and call back on this number.

654
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:13,916
Good girl.

655
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,958
<i>Hey.</i>

656
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:27,875
Hey, Spider.

657
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:31,041
I'm gonna need
another favor from you, my friend.

658
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:34,125
I'm, uh, here with Senator Swann

659
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:36,875
and, uh, his sons.

660
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:37,833
They're torturing me.

661
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,250
Shoot her, Jesse!
Shoot her!

662
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,875
- Gun down. Down.

663
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:58,916
Do what she says, boys.

664
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,291
Get in the cell.

665
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,125
- She's not gonna kill you.
- No, Parker!

666
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:08,208
In the cell, now.

667
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:18,833
Get on the ground!

668
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,666
- Shit.
- Now!

669
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:27,500
Okay.

670
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:34,875
Stay down!

671
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,791
<i>Calling all cars.
Calling all cars.</i>

672
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:32,083
<i>Be on the lookout
for a Swann County Sheriff's patrol SUV.</i>

673
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,583
<i>Driver is a woman, Hispanic, 30s.</i>
