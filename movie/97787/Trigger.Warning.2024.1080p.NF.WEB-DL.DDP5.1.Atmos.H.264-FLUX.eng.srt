00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,830
They figured out
we're not aid workers.

00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,450
<i>Three klicks from the ridge.
Two cars in pursuit. Possible RPG.</i>

3
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,540
Don't let them line up a shot!

4
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,160
Moving into position now.

5
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,450
In position.

6
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,040
I have visual. Spider?
I have a shot.

7
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,580
Let her rip. We are ready to boogie.

8
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,330
What was that?
It's a trap! Shooters on the ridge!

9
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,500
Hit the other driver!
They're lining up the shot!

10
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Shoot the truck!

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,040
Let's go
before the others come.

12
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,540
The truck is empty.

13
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,540
Driver's dead.
Other guy is gone.

14
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,540
Grab the gun.
I'll look around.

15
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,500
Come on, work!

16
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,500

17
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500

18
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,700

19
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,700
<i>Parker, we are approaching the vehicle.
What's your status?</i>

20
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,660
I'm sorry, Nick.

21
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,410
- I volunteered to tell the family.
- I'll come with.

22
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,330
No, I got it.

23
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,950
- Adam, no!

24
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,870
Parker!

25
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,580
What are you doing?!

26
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,910
Hey! Stop it!

27
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,500
Enough! Parker!

28
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,160
It's over! It's over!

29
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,700
<i>Unbelievable.

You can't solve
every problem with a knife.

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,290
Should I just have let him
murder assets?

32
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,580
How does he think
we're going to get information from them

33
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,750
if he keeps killing them all? Hmm?

34
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,290
I don't think the boy thinks.

<i>♪ Pull it out push it in... ♪</i>

36
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,830
Adam requested that you be

37
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,620

- I did not.

40
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,500
- You're gonna get caught.
- I'm not gonna get caught.

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,910
You are gonna get caught.

42
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,370
I deleted the request.

43
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,910
"Thank you, Spider!"
"You're so welcome, Parker."

44
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,330
Hmm. That's how that should've gone.

45
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,250
You read my emails?

46

- No, I do not read your emails.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,910
But that's only because you need to learn
to unsubscribe from some shit.

- Now, you have too much spam, girl.

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,830
You got more spam
than a Hawaiian middle school in there.

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,830
Yo, what's that?

51
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,790

52
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,540

Hey, Parker. How you doing?

54
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,830
Hey, um, it's not really a great time.

55
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,120
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

56
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,870
So...

57
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,870
Listen, there was a cave-in
at the mine last night.

58
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,660
And your dad got caught underneath it.

59
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,500
And by the time we found him,
it was too late.

60
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
{\an8}Hi.

61
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,580
{\an8}Hi.

62
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,120
I'm just, uh...

63
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,450
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around all of this.

64
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,950
I've been thinking that maybe there's

65
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,200
some kind of poetry or something

66
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,080
in the fact that he was swallowed up
in his favorite place.

67
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,790
He loved that damn cave.

68
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,120
What's that?

69
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,620
Found it on his desk
in the bedroom.

70
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,120
Well, it's a letter. Why is it evidence?

71
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,250
Well, I'm wondering if it, uh...

72
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,000
if it could have been on purpose.

73
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,870
The cave-in, I mean.

74
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,750
You think this is a suicide note?

75
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,000
This is... It's just a letter.

76
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,910
I mean, we would write
each other sometimes. It's not a--

77
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,500
It's not evidence for anything.
It's just a letter.

78
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,700
All right. Uh... How did he sound
the last time you two spoke?

79
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,910
Lonely? I don't know.

80
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,450
He missed me.

81
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,870
We... We missed each other.
We always miss each other.

82
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,250
He's not that guy.

83
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,370
I mean, it was an old mine,
a really old mine,

84
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,000
and old mines have cave-ins all the time.

85
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,290
Right. No. You... You...
You're right. I'm sorry.

86
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,750
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,580
Hands are sweating. I... I don't know.

88
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,250
It's fine. It's...

89
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,450
Um...

90
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,910
Can I give you a ride home?

91
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
- Yeah, I... I need a ride.
- Yeah, I'm gonna give you a ride home. Um...

92
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,950
Let me grab my keys.

95
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,450

re-election campaign going?

96
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,250
Uh, uh, it's going.

97
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,950
Think one of your dad's rich donor friends

98
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,000
would be interested in buying Maria's?

99
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,000
Seriously?

100
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,250
Yeah.

101
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,330
But Harry built Maria's for you.

102
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,250
You don't want to stay and run the bar?

103
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't stay.
I'm gonna leave after the funeral.

104
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,950
It just doesn't feel like home
without Pops here.

105
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,200
You want me to help you
take these upstairs?

106
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,250
Oh, no, it's... it's fine. I'm okay.

107
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
All right.

108
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,160
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I'll, uh...

109
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll let you get settled in, then.

110
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,330
Okay.

111
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,250
You need me, just holler. Okay?

112
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,450
Thanks.

113
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
Cheers, Pops.

114
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Oh jeez! I'm here to feed the lizard!
Please don't kill me!

115
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,160
Mikey?

116
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,660
Parker?

117
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,080
Ugh.

118
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,580
Jesus.

119
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,500
You all right?

120
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,950
No! No, I almost shit myself.

121
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,160
Sorry about that.

122
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,540
No, it's good to see you.

123
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,410
Now, uh, where's that lizard?

124
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,080
Uh, Andy, come on out, buddy.
It's dinnertime.

125
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,660
Does he usually come
when you call?

126
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,000
No.

127
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
Hmm.

128
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,910
Uh, Harry was really proud of you.

129
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,950
He always talked about it.

130
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,750
How you... were killing terrorists,
doing spy shit.

131
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,660
I don't know, whatever you're doing.

132
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,910
Do you know where they found him?

133
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,370
I found him, actually.

134
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh man. Mikey, I'm sorry.

135
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,830
Will you show me?

136
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,620
Is that a camera?

137
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,790
Yeah, yeah.
Harry, uh, stepped up security lately.

138
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,830
He actually got real cameras this time.
Not like the fake ones in the bar.

139
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,120
So I saw a lot of dust
coming out of the mine.

140
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,790
Uh...

141
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,040
It was crazy. It was so thick that I could
barely see my hand in front of my face.

142
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,000
Couldn't find him anywhere.

143
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,790
I was, uh... I was worried,
really worried something happened to him.

144
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,660
He'd just been spending
so much more time down here.

145
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,580
Why?

146
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,410
I don't know.

147
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,040
<i>This knife
protected your</i> abuelo<i>.</i>

148
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,450
It got me through Vietnam.
It's part of our legacy.

149
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,790
Look at how tall you've gotten.

150
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,000
It's done.

151
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,950
I need you to sharpen this
when we go back.

152
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,620
Never carry a knife without...

153
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,500
Without sharpening it.

154
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
Hey.

155
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,950
- Parker.
Huh?

156
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,950
It's over here.

157
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,540
It took me like an hour
to feel my way over here.

158
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,500
At first, I... I was worried
he was trapped on the other side.

159
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,910
So I was... I was yelling for him,
and then, uh--

160
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,120
And then I saw the... the blood.

161
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,790
I didn't know rocks
could come down like that. Scary shit.

162
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,790
You okay?

163
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,660
Yeah, it's just...

164
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,830
What is that?

165
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,160
Did Pops mention

166
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,870
opening the tunnel more?

167
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't... I don't know.

168
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,910
Why?

169
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,120
Huh.

170
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,200
Look at these pockmarks.

171
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,080
Uh, yeah, what about it?

172
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,790
Think you can, uh, do something
about the power?

173
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,000
Uh, yeah, let me see what I can do.

174
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,370
Okay.

175
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,290
<i>This place is incredible.</i>

176
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,910
Imagine people come in,
getting some of our family's recipes.

177
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,750
Sitting with your neighbors,
enjoying each other.

178
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,410
- What name should we give it?
- We should name it after Grandma.

179
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,700
Maria's.

180
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,160
All right, boss.

181
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,500
Maria's it is.

182
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,410
So, uh, guess you're
my new boss now, right?

183
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,370
- Till I sell the place, yeah.
- Oh.

184
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,950
Figured you were taking it over.
You know, he always talked about it.

185
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,290
Nah. I gotta get back to work.

186
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Well, if you're interested in keeping it,
you know I could always run it for you.

187
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,950
We could turn a profit.

188
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,750
- Not a big one, but--
- Cover your ears!

189
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,660
- Why? Is that the grenade?

190
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,000
Parker...
...what the hell was that about?

191
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,370
- I have a question, Mike.
Yeah.

192
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,040
I believe that that mine collapse happened
because of one of these grenades.

193
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,580
- Okay.
- See the pockmarks in the rocks? The same.

194
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
But my father was a Green Beret,

195
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,950
and he knew how to handle explosives.

196
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
So what happened?

197
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,910
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe he forgot he pulled the pin.

198
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,660
That's not possible.

199
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,000
It... It might be.

200
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,120
Okay? He was, uh...
he was getting forgetful.

201
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,200
What do you mean forgetful?

202
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,450
Like, you know,
he was... he was getting old.

203
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,540
He was just forgetting shit.

204
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,330
Pops never mentioned it.

205
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,540
Well, he's probably
just trying not to worry you.

206
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,160
Plus, we all take care of each other here.

207
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,200
Like, when this place was hit,

208
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,660
people were here
in like 30 minutes boarding it up.

209
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,790
Well, I'm gonna get another.

210
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,750
Do you want one?

211
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,330
Yeah. Here, twist my arm.

212
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,660
Okay.

213
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh.

214

00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,450
I'm getting a refill.

217
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,290
- Help yourself.
Thank you.

218
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,450
Yo, Mo.

219
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,370
Yo!
- Can we get another round over here?

220
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,120
Yes, sir, just give me one second.

No girl was ever good enough

I do think you guys would have

- Mm-hmm.

248
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,910
Such a flirt.

249
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,950
Hold up.

250
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,830
What? It's a busted up car.

251
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,120
Jesse ever arrest the people
that knocked over this place?

252
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,450
No difference. Some assholes
robbed Frank's trailer last week.

253
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,200
Gas station got hit a month ago.

Hmm.

255
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,370
Got people staring at us.

256
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,290

257
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,910
- How do you like that? That was...

258
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,700
- That was pretty. Yeah.
- That was smooth as hell.

259
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,200
- Oh man.
Mike, let's sit for a sec.

260
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,660
I just want to keep an eye on that truck.

261
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,040
It's... stolen.

262

Truck you were looking in?
Mm-hmm.

263
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,160
Okay, well, if it's stolen, you want me
to call Jesse? He'll take care of it.

264
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,370
Not yet.

265
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,540
- Start the car.

266

Leave one car distance
between us and them, okay?

269
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,750
Fuck, okay, it feels weird.

270
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,250
You know, what if they just drive
a busted-up car?

271
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,750
And now we're... we're being Karens,
we're following them.

272
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,450
We are not being Karens.

273
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,450
They had a machine gun
in the back of their car.

274
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,620
A machine gun?
Where would you even get a machine gun?

275
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,370
It's not easy.

276
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,790
Holy shit.
Yup.

277
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,540
Now, my friend, you can call Jesse.

278
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,250
Okay, I'm going to call--
Where are you going? Parker!

279
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,290
What the hell are you doing?! Shit.

280
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,120
Any other cash in here?

281
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,870
You got a safe? Huh?

282
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,160
Hey, yo, yo, see if there's a safe.

283
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,370
Come on! Let's go.

284
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,250
They held me at gunpoint
and took it right off my wrist.

285
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,120
You know, my dad gave me this watch
when I graduated high school.

286
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,910
I can't believe you found it.

287
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,120
And you remembered
it was mine after all these years?

288
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,040
Yeah.

289
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,290
I'm sorry about Harry,
but I'm glad you're home, kid.

290
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,040
Huh.

291
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,120

292
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,620

293
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,200

Ah. Load me up.

297
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,450

298
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,830

- This is the one.

299
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,700

Whoa!

300
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,330

302
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,660
Are they just giving out
military weapons now?

303
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,830

- Hey. Is this a bad time?

304
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,540
<i>Nah, for you, never.
No, I'm just walking to the car.</i>

305
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,910

307
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,870
You know, home.

309
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,370
Small-time cloud storage

310

<i>Think you can break into it?</i>

311
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,120
Who are you talking to?
Of course I can break into it. Why?

312
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,410

314
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,950

I don't know, take a look-see?

315
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,330
- Yes, please.
- You know <i>the deal. Shoot me that link.</i>

316
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,500
<i>I already did.</i>

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,290
<i>All right. I am in.</i>

318
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,660

319
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,000

00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,410
Yeah, now I see where you get
all your chaotic storage vibes from.

322
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,250
I mean, it's a lot of footage here, P,
but no organizational system.

323
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,830
<i>Can you go to the day he died?</i>

324
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,500
<i>- It's two Thursdays ago.</i>
- I mean, that's gonna be a minute.

325
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,450
It's a lot of footage, and I gotta go
file by file, check every single one.

326
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,450
Let me see if I can get an intern
to write a program for you. Hold up. Okay.

327
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,290
I see, uh, some footage of a monster truck
with some flames on the side.

328
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,450
<i>- Any idea who that could be?</i>
- Is it black?

329
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,040
<i>- That's the one.</i>
- Yeah.

330
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,330
Elvis Swann, two n's.

331
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,080
<i>He's a total dipshit.</i>

332
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,750
<i>His dad is a senator.</i>

333
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,790
<i>I actually caught him messing around
with an RPG on my property earlier.</i>

334
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,200
- Any idea why he'd be in the mine?
<i>- Pops had it set up like a living room.</i>

335
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,540
<i>He had a stash there.</i>

336
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,080
<i>Booze, old records, movies.</i>

337
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,950
Oh shit. Your pops
had an actual man cave in a real cave?

338
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah.

339
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,450
<i>- </i>  Mmm.
<i>- Oh, other hobbies.</i>

340
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,080
<i>Your boy Elvis watches a lot of porn.</i>

341
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,700
Uh, looks like
he's on the dark web a lot too.

342
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,120
<i>Really? Doing what?</i>

343
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,250
It looks like selling some M16s,
Sig Sauers, MK13s.

344
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,830
All this stuff's still active service.

345
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,040
I mean, they've got to be stolen.
Any mention of grenades?

346
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,450
Don't see any grenades.
It's probably a hard sell these days.

347
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,370
I swear, if he had anything
to do with that cave-in, I will kill him.

348
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,000
Hey, P, get proof first.

349
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,910
<i>Trail him a bit. Track him.
I'll call you when I have something.</i>

350
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,750
<i>You good otherwise?</i>

351
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,370
<i>I'm always good.</i>

352
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,910
Shit.

353
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,870
Hey.
- Oh, what's up, fool?

354
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,200
Parker?

355
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, what a treat!
Hey.

356
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,290
Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

357
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,500
Don't mind the hands.
I'm getting a bird ready.

358
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,830
- No worries.
- Do you want a beer?

359
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,160
- Of course I do.
- All I've got's light.

360
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,540
Yeah, I'll take a beer too, please.

361
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,250
Sorry, you're out.

362
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,330
Mom, you didn't get beer?

363
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,500
So, Georgia, since you
kind of have your ear to the ground,

364
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,540
what have you heard
about Elvis other than,

365
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,540
you know, being a piece of shit?

366
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,080
He's the same old entitled you-know-what,

367
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,330
selling drugs to Allen's kids,
riding around Quinnie's lot drunk.

368
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,660
Still hanging with, uh, Beck and Mickey?

369
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,620
Mm-hmm.

370
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,450
Wow, those guys haven't been arrested yet.

371
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,790
Well, who's gonna arrest him, Parker?
Jesse? I mean, come on.

372
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,790
Touché.

373
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,660
Elvis got them jobs at the Army depot.

374
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,120
I can't imagine
what they're doing there though.

375
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Not making this town any safer.

376
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,000
You hear anything
about Elvis and guns, Mikey?

377
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,540
Uh, I don't know.

378
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,450
Um...

379
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,290
Matter of fact, yeah. He tried to sell
an AK, uh, to my buddy Trench.

380
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,500
- Tried to trade him for his dirt bike.
- No.

381
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,620
- Yeah.
- Where'd he get an AK from?

382
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,160
- Uh... Walmart.
Mmm.

383
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,910
- Think they're having a sale.
- Funny.

384
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
'Sup, hot stuff?

385
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,540
<i>Your boy Elvis has an exchange
set for this afternoon at his place.</i>

386
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,330
- Really?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

387
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,620
<i>And I assume you've snuck into
a window or two in your youth.</i>

388
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,410
Your assumptions are correct.

389
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,250
<i>I wonder what you think
about that, Senator Swann.</i>

390
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,450
<i>I've never felt
more unsafe in my own country.</i>

391
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,450
<i>In an effort to be progressive,
Washington has stopped protecting us.</i>

392
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,410
<i>When I'm re-elected,
I will continue to fight for our values.</i>

393
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,950
<i>Freedom, family, and faith.</i>

394
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,660
<i>I am Creation through and through.</i>

395
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,250
<i>Swann residence.</i>
We're here to see Elvis.

396
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,330
<i>Come on in, boys.</i>

397
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,500
<i>I couldn't agree more,
Senator Swann.</i>

398
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,120
<i>Thank you, and God bless.</i>

399
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,750
<i>God bless America.</i>

400
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,370
A little more party, huh?

401
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,540
A little more party.

402
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,200
Okay, boys.

403
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,830
I got this one right here.

404
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,830
Since day one, baby!

405
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,160
Yeah, I'll take all of these.

406
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,750
Great, great.

407
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,660
Rumor has it you might have access
to something a little bigger.

408
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,950
How much bigger
are we talking about?

409
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,950
I'm looking for RPGs.

410
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,160
Ah... I'll have to talk
to my connect about that.

411
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,370
See what I can, uh... See what I can do.

412
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,750
You get me five RPGs,
and I'll have half a mil

413
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,040
in your bank account
by the end of next week.

414
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,410
Yeah, I think we can figure something out.

415
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,660
Anybody can defend America
against foreign threats.

416
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,290
Oh really?
Mm-hmm.

417
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:22,580
But how many people can defend
Quinnie's new herd from meth heads?

418
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,830
- I think you should quit.

419
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,250
Move back home, come on as my deputy.

420
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,660
I think you just miss me.

421
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,410
You think?
Yeah.

422
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,080
- Hey, Parker.

423
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,080
Hey, Dad.

424
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,250
Senator.

425
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,750
I see you two old lovebirds.

426
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,290
How is being back?

427
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,620
Um...

428
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,290
- Good.
- Yeah?

429
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,500
I see your campaign is, uh, going well.

430
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,580
You're on all the billboards,
and I hear your ads on the radio.

431
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,370
Mm-hmm.
- Very passionate.

432
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,160
Nah, that's some bullshit.
Power over policy, right?

433
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,330
That's what people want, Parker.

434
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,620
We have got to have her over the house
one of these nights, huh?

435
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,120
Catch up, right?

436
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,540
I mean, I would get
drips and drabs from my son here.

437
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,000
Sure.

438
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,410
Yeah?

439
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,910
Well, how about this weekend?

440
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,040
You'll come too, Jesse.

441
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,700
Anyway, I gotta get back to the office.

442
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,910
It's good to see you.

443
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,830
Have fun.

444
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,910
God, I feel like
I've been shot back to high school,

445
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,080
like I should be
worried about sneaking off

446
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,250
before Harry's done with last call.

447
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,910
Remember that time
I tried sneaking out the window,

448
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,160
and he was in the parking lot
with his friends?

449
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,040
And he said, "Jesse, what've you been
doing these days, other than my daughter?"

450
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,750
Yeah.

451
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,700
I thought I was dead,

452
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,040
till he started laughing.

453
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,200
He liked you.

454
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,160
He liked messing with me.

455
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,450
Same thing.

456
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,200
He didn't kill himself, Jesse.

457
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,500
You know that, right?

458
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,370
Well, he hadn't been himself lately.

459
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,500
You know, he was...
getting more and more confused.

460
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,830
It's not like any of us were worried
about him being home alone or anything.

461
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,750
It was just that sometimes he would...

462
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,580
...you know.

463
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,330
I know. Mike told me.

464
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,580
So you think he killed himself
because he was forgetful?

465
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,200
That's not a thing.

466
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,700
When are you gonna release the body?

467
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,290
Uh, tomorrow.

468
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,830
I told them to prepare him for cremation
so you can have the funeral.

469
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,580
And we're ruling it an accident.

470
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,950
Good, because it was.

471
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,660
It was an accident.

472
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,080
Is there anything I can do?

473
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,910
I wanna help.

474
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,080
That's very generous of you.

475
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,750
It's Roberto.

476
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,540
He's gonna make me go
back to AA, I guess.

477
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,790
Better than getting a divorce.

478
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,870
Ugh.

479
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,200
Everyone in town knows
I'm not racist.

480
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,120
Hmm.

481
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,580
In fact, my great-grandfather

482
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,290
was a Native American.

483
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,660
Oh really?

484
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,620
Yeah.
- What tribe?

485
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,870
Yeah, I don't know.

486
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,620
But it's where I get
my lactose intolerance from.

487
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,450
You're funny.

488
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,080
You know, people see a white guy

489
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,120
spouting conservative talking points
in this climate and they shut down.

490
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,000
Never mind that most Latinos
are conservative.

491
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,620
You know, people like you
around here, Parker.

492
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,250
They like Harry, or liked him.

493
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,370
- If I could get an endorsement from you--
Oh, hey, careful, Dad.

494
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,660
You blow her ego up too much,
she's gonna end up running against you.

495
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,040
Now there's a question
I wanted to ask you. Uh...

496
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,410
How am I supposed to say that, that, uh...
that "Latinx"?

497
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,250
How do I say it? Is it Latinx or...

498
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,160
It's great.
The way you're saying it, it's great.

499
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,660
- Oh, is that right?
Mm-hmm.

500
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,120
Well, can I be honest with you?

501
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,200
Please.

502
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,950
I don't understand it at all.

503
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,160
Latinx.

504
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,040
- I gotta go.
You can't stay for a minute?

505
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,200
No, no. It's a... It's a work emergency.

506
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,080
Let's do this again.

507
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,660
That's a shitload of rocks.
Going to be clearing them all night.

508
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,000
The Swanns need to pay us
for this shit.

509
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,290
How long before she's back?

510
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,040
Wow, I guess this spic
really loved Chuck Norris.

511
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,410
We should take those back with us.

512
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,500
This is my favorite part.

513
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,000
Come on, Elvis, get up.
This is your mess.

514
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,080
Mm-hmm.

515
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,370
Get out of his chair!

516
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,950
- Oh shit!

517
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,830
- You did it, didn't you? Didn't you?
- What?

518
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,580
- Help!
Elvis?

519
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,290
Shit!

520
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,540
Walk. Now!

521
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,000
Do what she says. Go!

522
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,330
Go on, go! Come on, get to it!

523
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,040
- Shit. No! Oh.

524
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,160
Hey, hey.

525
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,120
- I didn't kill Harry, okay?
- I don't want to hear it!

526
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,750
What do you think's gonna happen?
My brother's gonna come and arrest me? Ah!

527
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,500
Ow, don't do that!

528
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,790
What makes you think
he doesn't already know I'm here?

529
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,120
Huh?

530
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,500
Oh God, Maria's!

531
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,040
No! Stop!

532
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,830
Please, stop!

533
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:26,410
Fucking bitch!

534
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,330
Mickey, stop!

535
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,750
Come back here!

536
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,500
Come out here, bitch!

537
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,750
Come on, Elvis, get in.

538
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,870
Get it goin'! Come on!

539
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:50,700
Elvis!

540
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,250
Oh shit!

541
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,790
Let's go. Come on!

542
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,160
The tires are flat.

543
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,580
What the fuck?

544
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,000
You killed Pops.

545
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,450
- You killed him, didn't you?
- Hey, get off him.

546
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:11,200
You smuggled guns through the tunnels,
and he caught you.

547
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,790
I said get the hell off him!

548
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,540
Parker, stop it!
Get off him! You're gonna kill him!

549
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,120
Admit it! Admit it, Elvis!

550
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,580
Calm down,
or I'm gonna have to arrest you.

551
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,370
He murdered Pops!

552
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,410
I'm gonna kill him!

553
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,700
You told me you stopped.

554
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,120
Right. Oh...

555
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,950
You don't know how much they were offering
for just a couple of these missiles, so...

556
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,870
Who are these people?

557
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,750
I don't know. They're...
They're people from the fucking Internet.

558
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,370
Fucking motherfucker!
- Boys! Come on, quit it. Quit it!

559
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,080
You're the worst thing
that's happened to this place.

560
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,410
You know that?

561
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,580
Selling goddamn stolen guns
on the dark web,

562
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,910
drawing every type
of nasty person to our town!

563
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,700
All this crime is a win.

564
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,450
It's a win!

565
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,580
You're the sheriff of the town.
You get to play hero.

566
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,950
Dad looks generous.

567
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,790
It's saving his fucking career, man.
I mean, you guys should be thanking me.

568
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,580
Goddamn it.

569
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,660
If you'd just kept her at the dinner,
none of this shit would've happened.

570
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,790
Everything would've been fine. She would
be having a nice meal, enjoying herself

571
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,250
while we cleared out the cave
and got the fucking missiles!

572
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,500
You could've at least told me
what the goddamn plan was.

573
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,660
- Supposed to tell you everything?
- You're supposed to--

574
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,410
Enough!

575
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,660
Enough!

576
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,120
How much does Parker know about this?

577
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,450
Too much.

578
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,700
You gotta clean this up.

579
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,950
I got good news for you.

580
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,830
My dad found a buyer
for the five acres around Maria's.

581
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,160
They're willing to give you
three million for it, as is.

582
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,910
Five million.

583
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,330
Just take the money
and go back to your life.

584
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,620
How... involved are you?

585
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,700
Was our whole thing
supposed to be... a distraction?

586
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,080
No. No.

587
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,120
You let me think he killed himself.

588
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,410
What are you doing?

589
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,830
There's footage of their bullshit.

590
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,370
The best thing you can do
is turn yourself and them in.

591
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,200
The cameras in the bar are fake.

592
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,790
He put real ones outside.

593
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,330
I'll need to see them, then.

594
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,250
Oh really?

595
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,370
Not before my lawyer does.

596
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,580
Thanks for coming out all this way.

597
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,910
Anything for Spider.

598
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,160
- Luis Torres.
- Parker.

599
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,200
- Pleasure to meet you, Parker.
- You too.

600
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,700
Can you, uh, excuse us?

601
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah, I'll be in my office.

602
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,660
You're being held
for assaulting Elvis,

603
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,450
but they also found a body at Maria's.

604
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:15,290
Sheriff.

605
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,910
Wonder if I could ask a few questions.

606
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,870
- Yeah, sure. Sit.
Thank you.

607
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,450
Sheriff, the men Parker caught
robbing the feed store last week,

608
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,080
they're still in the hospital, yes?

609
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,870
Mm-hmm. Are they relevant to all this?

610
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,040
No, just doing my due diligence.

611
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,410
Your brother, Elvis,

612
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:40,200
he's employed by your father, yes?

613
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,870
- In a limited capacity.
- Which is what?

614
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,250
I stay out of it.

615
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,080
All right.

616
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:53,540
Well, that's all I got for right now.
Thank you for your hospitality.

617
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,410
Sheriff?

618
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,540
Oh, don't you want to be
done with this, Parker?

619
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:06,660
Come on.

620
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,120
Just give us the security tapes.

621
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:15,160
You know, if you, uh... if you

622
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,160
pivot on that back foot,

623
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,370
you won't punch like such a little bitch.

624
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,870
Maybe she's full of shit.

625
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,700
There is no security footage.

626
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,000
Harry had no fucking idea
what he was talking about half the time.

627
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,250
Fucking--

628
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,660
Parker, please.

629
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,290
You can make this stop.

630
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,500
So could you.

631
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,160
Why don't you
just tell us what's on the tape,

632
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,370
and then we'll give you
a little water and some food,

633
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:54,450
and you know,
take those little cuffs off for a while.

634
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:58,250
- No, I'm good. I'm good. I like it here.
Yeah?

635
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,750
You wanna know
what really happened to Harry?

636
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,080
Dad.

637
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,750
Look, I'm working with the hand I got.

638
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,250
Let's make a trade.

639
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,290
Okay.

640
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,500
It's with a friend of mine.

641
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,200
I need to call
and tell him where to send it.

642
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:23,910
Come on.

643
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,410
What?

644
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,500
If you tell her too much now,
it fucks everything.

645
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,290
Well, we can keep busting her ass.

646
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,000
- I mean, either way it's on her.
You've gotta call this off.

647
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,160
The fuck?
Who are these people?

648
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:53,950
If you try anything...

649
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,040
you understand
what's gonna happen to you, yes?

650
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,290
What's his number?

651
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,120
202...

652
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,500
555-1227.

653
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,200
Tell him it's Parker,
and call back on this number.

654
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:13,910
Good girl.

655
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,950
<i>Hey.</i>

656
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,870
Hey, Spider.

657
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:31,040
I'm gonna need
another favor from you, my friend.

658
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,120
I'm, uh, here with Senator Swann

659
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,870
and, uh, his sons.

660
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,830
They're torturing me.

661
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,250
Shoot her, Jesse!
Shoot her!

662
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,870
- Gun down. Down.

663
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:58,910
Do what she says, boys.

664
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,290
Get in the cell.

665
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,120
- She's not gonna kill you.
- No, Parker!

666
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,200
In the cell, now.

667
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,830
Get on the ground!

668
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,660
- Shit.
- Now!

669
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,500
Okay.

670
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,870
Stay down!

671
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,790
<i>Calling all cars.
Calling all cars.</i>

672
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:32,080
<i>Be on the lookout
for a Swann County Sheriff's patrol SUV.</i>

673
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,580
<i>Driver is a woman, Hispanic, 30s.</i>

674
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,080
<i>Should be considered armed and dangerous.</i>

675
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,410
Maybe you should
stop the car.

676
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:49,700
No, I'm fine.

677
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,830
<i>Yo, if you get this, call me.
I'm coming out there.</i>

678
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,120
<i>You better be okay.</i>

679
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,040
Shit.

680
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,330
Uh...

681
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,500
What was his name?

682
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,580
- Where is she?
- Jesus, Beck!

683
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,450
- Jesus Christ, Elvis!
Get up! Come on.

684
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,080
Just tell me where she's at.

685
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,450
Mike, come on. Where is she, huh?

686
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:59,370
Who?! Who the--
- Come on, you know who I'm talking about.

687
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,200
- Come on.

688
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,950
- What the hell are you doing?
Shit!

689
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:04,660
Pull the trigger.
See what happens.

690
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,910
Mom, put... Mom, put the gun--
Huh?

691
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,410
- I will blow his brains out.
No! Fuck.

692
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:13,500
Hey. Look what we got here.
There's blood on the carpet.

693
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,700
Hey, take the shotgun.

694
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:18,250
What?

695
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:21,370
Come on out, Parker. I'll shoot
both of them. I promise you that.

696
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,370
- No one's in the basement, Elvis.
- Shut up.

697
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,410
Get your ass down there.

698
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,830
- Go on.
- You guys are stupid.

699
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,200
I told you there's nobody down here.

700
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,410
What's this shit?
- It's weed, Elvis.

701
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,950
- You see Parker, you call me. Okay?
- Yeah.

702
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:45,790
If not, I'm coming back here and I'm gonna
burn this goddamn house down.

703
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:46,700
Okay.

704
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,290
I'm taking this shit.

705
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,540
You better call me if you see her.
Now, let's get the hell out of here.

706
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,410
Elvis has left the building.

707
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,370
- God.

708
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,450
Oh shit, man.

709
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,000
Shit.

710
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:39,370
Oh, someone's waking up.

711
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,000
How we doing?

712
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:44,700
How'd I get here?

713
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,330
That would be Roberto.
You went off the road near his tractor.

714
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:51,000
He pulled you out of the wreck
and brought you here.

715
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:55,200
Dude, the hell
you getting into with Elvis?

716
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:02,250
Elvis...

717
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,700
Elvis is using Pops's mine.

718
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,620
He's using Pops's mine to take...

719
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,200
weapons from the military depot.

720
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,040
Shit.

721
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,200
Elvis...

722
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,790
Elvis is the reason why Pops

723
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,370
is dead.

724
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,660
Shh. Shh.

725
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:36,370
- I'm gonna get him.
No.

726
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:39,410
You're not going anywhere right now
except getting rid of this fever.

727
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,120
- All right? Just sleep.

728
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:43,910
Shh.

729
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:57,830
I did some research
into the guy you've been selling to.

730
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,540
I don't want to talk
about that shit right now.

731
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,910
He's on the domestic terrorist watch list.

732
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,580
He's the guy that blew up
server farms a few years ago,

733
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,660
killed 37 people.

734
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,500
This is some
Timothy McVeigh-level shit, man.

735
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,830
You got to call this off.

736
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,580
No.

737
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,410
They've been expecting
those weapons for two days now.

738
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,620
What do you think happens
if we don't deliver, huh?

739
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,540
Ouch.

740
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,040
Yo.

741
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,450
Mikey.

742
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,200
What the f--?

743
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,000
How long have I been down here?

744
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,330
Uh, better part of three days.

745
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,250
Sure you should be getting up?

746
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:39,910
Unless you want me
to piss on your floor.

747
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,410
Okay, well, let me help you.

748
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,040
- No, I'm... I'm good. I'm...
- I know. I know.

749
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,950
Oh yeah.

750
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,660
What's that?

751
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,000
Oh.

752
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:51,620
What's that?

753
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,450
This is the crop.

754
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,660
A lot of growers in the area

755
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,580
were using pesticides
and a bunch of garbage, so...

756
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,000
Took it upon myself to produce this.

757
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,040
It's impressive.
- Thank you.

758
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,040
- All right, I gotta pee.
- Oh yeah.

759
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,580
- Oh! Not so fast.
- Sorry.

760
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:18,040
How's it look?

761
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,500
Hang on.

762
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,830
Yeah, we're good.

763
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,080
I'm through.

764
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,660
Hey.

765
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,250
Yeah.

766
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,790
<i>Captain Mulberry's office.
How can I help you?</i>

767
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:02,950
This is Parker Calvo.
I need to speak to the captain.

768
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:05,120
Mass destruction.

769
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,580
No, I'm on leave.

770
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:12,160
But I uncovered criminal activity
at the Army depot in my hometown.

771
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:17,290
No, it's not an active investigation,
but the captain needs to know.

772
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:21,200
I don't know who's involved over there,
so I need to speak to the captain.

773
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,830
<i>He's not available.</i>

774
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:24,450
Just get him on the phone.

775
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:31,580
You're a dick!

776
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:39,040
So okay, so we can recover these missiles
after they've been sold, right?

777
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:39,950
I don't know.

778
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:44,120
FBI's been hunting that guy for years,
and he knows how to hide, so...

779
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,750
Uh, how can all these weapons go missing
and the government not notice?

780
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,910
That's ridiculous.

781
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,750
I mean, it's just a matter
of shuffling inventory around

782
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:54,120
and, you know,
screwing with government software.

783
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,250
It's actually not that hard.
I've done it myself.

784
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,410
Because you're a spy.

785
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,910
No. I'm not a spy. No.

786
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:02,750
Okay. Just what a spy would say.

787
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:07,040
Georgia, do you have any more
of those, like, magical pain pills?

788
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,750
So what do you do for the government?

789
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:11,620
Shenanigans.

790
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,500
- Shenanigans?
Mmm.

791
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,660
Thank you.

792
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:22,200
You wouldn't, by any chance, have a bunch
of guns lying around somewhere, do you?

793
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,120
No.

794
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,410
But I know who does.

795
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,080
Whoa.

796
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,250
Mo, you sexy bitch.

797
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,000
Mm-hmm. I've got the perfect one.

798
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,080
For the record, I think this is a mistake.

799
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,370
That'll work.

800
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:55,040
- Ammo, please.
- Right here.

801
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,330
Thank you, my friend.

802
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:58,660
<i>Te amo.</i>

803
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,250
<i>Cuídateme.</i>

804
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,290
Whoa!

805
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,040
- Huh!

806
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,200
You can pull up
a lot of shit with this, Frank.

807
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,370
Yeah. Yeah.

808
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,410
You know, Parker, I...

809
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:21,450
I feel like I'm doing wrong by Harry
by... by letting you go off like this.

810
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:31,660
Unfortunately, Frank, my friend,
you don't get a say in what I do.

811
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,580
Yeah, I... I know.

812
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,450
- But you know what you can do?
- What's that?

813
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,580
Make sure I go in prepared.

814
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,950
I will. Okay.

815
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,660
- Thanks.
You're welcome.

816
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,330
Wow.

817
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,080
That's not a gift. It's a loan.

818
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,790
I like it.

819
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,830
You're a businessman, right?

820
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,330
You understand delays happen.

821
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:43,000
Your son and I had a deal,
Mr. Swann.

822
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,200
- Important opportunities were missed.

823
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,870
Well, and I apologize for that.

824
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:50,410
Yeah?
That's not good enough.

825
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:52,750
It can't take days.

826
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,370
I'll tell you what.
Give me back all the money I paid you.

827
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,330
When you get everything together,
we'll renegotiate.

828
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,660
You'll have your supplies tomorrow.

829
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,000
Why don't you be a gentleman about this?

830
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,540
Elvis said it'll be a few days.

831
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,660
Having some access issues.

832
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,410
We'll throw something extra in for you.

833
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,120
I mean, uh, you boys like drones?

834
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:27,000
We'll get you a little drone at cost.
What do you think?

835
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,500
- I can't get you your money!

836
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,200
We spent it.
- On what?

837
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:39,910
My campaign.

838
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,620
Then show me where my weapons are.

839
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,410
How's it look?
- Elvis's truck is in there.

840
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,620
I'm gonna have to go in.

841
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,000
Well, you should be careful.

842
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,750
Yeah, well...

843
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,700
If it goes sideways, you drive.

844
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,120
All right? Don't try to be cute.

845
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,200
- You understand?
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

846
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,250
Shit, man.

847
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:21,660
Elvis?!

848
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,200
Jesse?!

849
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,580
- Why'd you do that? Huh?

850
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,450
Where's Jesse and Elvis?

851
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,370
I don't know!

852
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:34,040
Some mine.

853
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,370
What really happened to my pops?

854
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,540
I was just trying to make you talk.

855
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,790
We had nothing to do with him dying.

856
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,370
I was just bluffing.

857
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:22,290
Why are politicians such liars?

858
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,750
Now tell me the truth.

859
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,160
Did you kill him?

860
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,830
Parker?

861
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:03,160
I got him to talk.

862
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,330
Uh...

863
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:13,620
What did he say?

864
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,160
Pops discovered
what they were using the tunnel for.

865
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,910
And he went to blow it up.

866
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:33,290
Jesse shot him in the back.

867
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:42,410
While he was dying, he must have pulled
the pin from the grenade.

868
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:47,540
Tunnel went down.
That's why you found him under the rubble.

869
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,910
Shit.

870
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,870
Thanks for your help today.

871
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,620
What are you doing?

872
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,290
I can't let them leave with those weapons.

873
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,790
Parker! God-- Goddamn it.

874
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:19,370
That's a lot of guys.

875
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:22,790
The... The Swann mansion's one thing,
but... but these people are...

876
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:26,000
- I know those tunnels better than anyone.
So?

877
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:28,750
This isn't an option.

878
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,160
- What if I at least caused a diversion?
- No.

879
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:36,580
Don't go near the mine.

880
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:41,620
God, you scare the shit out of me.

881
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,410
Evening, fellas.

882
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:03,200
Looking for Parker.

883
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,620
Shit.
You've got the wrong place.

884
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,120
Yeah, seems like I do.

885
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,950
Sorry about that.

886
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,950
Oh, wait, wait. What name did you say?

887
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,200
- Was it Parker?
- Yeah, that's right.

888
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,750
Oh yeah, he's inside.

889
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,830
Come on.

890
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,410
- He's inside?
Sitting in there hanging out.

891
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,580
Yeah, you know,
I think I'll come back later.

892
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,540
Uh-uh.

893
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,040
Go ahead and throw it.

894
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,870
Man, if you step on my shoes...

895
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:46,000
Who the hell are you?

896
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:18,790
Right fucking now!
I want to know what's going on.

897
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:22,450
Why is one of my delivery trucks
on fucking fire right now?!

898
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:25,540
You find this amusing?

899
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,910
I'm gonna execute
your brother in front of you

900
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:30,200
if you don't start talking right now.

901
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:35,370
What's going on, Elvis?
I thought we had a deal. Huh?

902
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:42,700
How are you gonna replace those?
We had half a truck filled.

903
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,660
I didn't blow up
your goddamn truck.

904
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,000
All right?

905
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,500
Fuck! Ah...

906
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:58,160
Fuck.

907
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,620
Get back in that depot
and replace those crates.

908
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,040
That's not how this works.

909
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:07,450
We take any stuff that's not on that list,
they're gonna know it's missing.

910
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:11,040
If they don't do it,
shoot 'em and take it yourselves.

911
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,250
Get 'em the fuck out of here.

912
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,250
How much longer until my truck gets here?

913
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,080
- Fifteen minutes.
- Okay.

914
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,660
That's enough time for you
to find that prick on the ridge.

915
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:22,660
Get it out of him.

916
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:51,580
Hello, ladies.

917
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,080
How many are with you?
None.

918
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:06,450
- They know what we're doing in the depot?
Probably.

919
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:09,910
They're the US government, and y'all are
a bunch of dumbass hicks.

920
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,000
'Sup, damsel in distress?

921
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:31,500
- You good?
- Yeah.

922
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,830
- Thank you. The hell you got me into?

923
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:36,620
Just a little domestic terrorism.

924
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,200
We gotta blow this shit up.

925
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,120
We need to get the hell up out of here.

926
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,450
After we blow it up.

927
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,080
Here.

928
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,040
Parker! Fire in the hole!

929
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,370
Spider!

930
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,450
Spider!

931
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,120
Spider.

932
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:13,620
Spider!

933
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,160
Spic bitch.

934
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:33,580
Parker!

935
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,330
Mo! What are you... What are you doing here?

936
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:38,120
You okay?

937
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,410
Spider. I lost Spider.

938
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:44,910
- Lots of spiders in here, kid.
- Spider's her friend, Frank.

939
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,250
Spider!

940
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:59,000
Spider!

941
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,330
I... I got it.
Yeah, thanks.

942
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,250
Get the other guy.

943
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:07,200
Yeah. I got you.

944
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,540
Hey, hey, hey. Who's that?

945
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,250
- Hey. Hey.

946
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,200
You owe me a new suit.

947
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,540
Get the beam off his leg.

948
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,790
- No, stop. I don't want him to bleed out.

949
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,700
It's Jesse.

950
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,290
Go. Finish the job.

951
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,910
- Girl, get out of here. Go.
- I'll stay. Go on.

952
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:41,620
I got it.

953
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,620
- Oh.

954
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,790
Watch out.

955
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:03,700
I saw Jesse go up this way.

956
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,200
Okay, we're clear.

957
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,000
How's the arm, Parker?

958
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,330
- I'll live.
- What's on the other side of the door?

959
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,580
- Mo.
- Yeah?

960
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,620
- Grab the door.
- Okay.

961
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:32,250
Ugh.

962
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,450
Oh shit.

963
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,160
We're at the depot.

964
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,660
Put your guns away.

965
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,830
Let's go.

966
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,870
Shit.

967
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,370
Oh man. What are you doing?

968
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:04,120
All right.

969
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:07,000
Get everyone out of the mines. Okay?

970
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,160
I'll get Jesse. Go.

971
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,080
Wait.
- Help!

972
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,290
No. Parker!

973
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,540
Help! I've been shot!

974
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,500
- Hey, where are you coming from?
I've lost so much blood. Oh.

975
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,750
- Hey, get the CO.
My arm. I've lost so much blood.

976
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:28,830
- We'll get you to medical.
Please! I need a doctor.

977
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,910
- I'm feeling faint.
Okay, go grab the medic.

978
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,410
Yes, sir!
- Who shot you?

979
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:38,700
I don't know.

980
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:42,660
It was in the tunnels
at my property next door,

981
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,330
and the sheriff went after him.
I... I didn't see him. Did you?

982
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:47,910
- The sheriff? No.

983
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:50,620
- Any other civilians?
No, ma'am.

984
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:53,700
Oh God! Oh no.

985
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:56,000
Oh! Please...

986
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,000
Please go get a medic now.

987
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:01,290
- Please. I'm gonna bleed to death.
Don't move.

988
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,410
Sergeant!
You've got to see this.

989
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,200
There's a passage back here.

990
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:14,540
Fuck.

991
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,450
Come on, come on.

992
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:19,000
Get the fuck outta here.

993
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:24,330
How could you do it?!

994
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:29,370
Get away from me!

995
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,290
God!

996
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,250
God!

997
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,700
Oh fuck.

998
01:33:57,450 --> 01:34:00,370
He was better to you than your own father!

999
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,540
I'm calling the shots now.

1000
01:34:11,330 --> 01:34:12,750
You dumb piece of shit!

1001
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,750
Where do you think this goes?
How does it end?

1002
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,450
Everyone in town knows what you've done.

1003
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:23,370
I'm getting out of here.
- With that?

1004
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,000
How?

1005
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,120
You're smarter than this.

1006
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,750
- Give it to me.
- No.

1007
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,830
I won't hurt you.

1008
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:38,200
Bullshit.

1009
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:50,870
I'm gonna put my hand on your arm, okay?

1010
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,700
And I'm gonna slide it down.

1011
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,910
Okay?

1012
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:00,950
Just keep your hand
on the lever until I get a grip on it.

1013
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:03,830
Why are you helping me?

1014
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:07,370
Just-- Just breathe.

1015
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:12,250
Just breathe. Just breathe, okay?

1016
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:14,370
Harry caught us.

1017
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:18,660
I offered to cut him in.
He should've just listened to us.

1018
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:20,870
Stop. Stop it.

1019
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,040
I should've left this town, like you.

1020
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:26,160
This place is a black hole
that fucking eats you up.

1021
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,250
Stop. No!

1022
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:35,870
No!

1023
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,290
<i>A security threat
has been reported on base.</i>

1024
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:24,540
<i>All personnel must immediately evacuate
to the nearest safe area</i>

1025
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,620
<i>and follow emergency protocols.</i>

1026
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:42,250
<i>It's been four weeks
since the death</i>

1027
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:44,160
<i>of the now-disgraced Swann family.</i>

1028
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,790
<i>But change is already in the air,</i>

1029
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:48,410
<i>with a new ballot initiative
to rename the county.</i>

1030
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:50,500
<i>Has Creation changed for the better?</i>

1031
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,160
<i>Many are looking forward
to a new perspective in Creation.</i>

1032
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:56,120
<i>But who are the candidates
vying for Senator Swann's seat,</i>

1033
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,410
<i>and what kind of changes
are they promising?</i>

1034
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:01,330
I got it. Grab my laptop.

1035
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:05,040
All right, tough guy.
A cave fell on you. Will you just let me--

1036
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,750
Oh, you underestimate the month
of bed rest and Mike's medicinal weed.

1037
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:11,700
You see Cirrus Cloud? Hit that.

1038
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:15,080
- You ready?
Yep.

1039
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,410
All right. One, two...

1040
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,700
- Three, four.
Okay, you got it?

1041
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:22,450
Yeah, I remember.

1042
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:25,160
- I can't believe you didn't change it.

1043
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,000
My intern found
that footage from the night...

1044
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:40,700
of your pops being killed.

1045
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,200
I don't want to see it.

1046
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:46,330
See that folder to the bottom right?

1047
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:47,250
Yeah.

1048
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:50,500
Check that out.

1049
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:54,660
Looks like he was learning
to back up his files.

1050
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,370
Oh my God.

1051
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,080
Yo, the pink hair,
my favorite.

1052
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,040
'Cause you was obviously
going through something.

1053
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,660
You are one to talk.
- What?

1054
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:05,160
With that lumberjack vibe you're sporting.

1055
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:11,080
- All right, all right, all right.

1056
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:13,910
Hey, Mikey.

1057
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:14,870
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

1058
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:17,120
<i>I got two paint swatches here for you.</i>

1059
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:22,000
<i>One is, um, Dead Salmon,
and the other is Grandmother's Chin.</i>

1060
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,290
<i>No, that's not right.
It's Grandmother's China</i>

1061
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:29,290
<i>Um, which one do you want
to, uh, put up behind the bar?</i>

1062
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:31,750
I feel like you should make
these decisions

1063
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:34,290
because you're the one
that's gonna be looking at it.

1064
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:37,830
<i>I was thinking Dead Salmon
would go the best with the light.</i>

1065
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:39,040
Okay.

1066
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:42,330
<i>Also, a bunch of soldiers
are asking around town about you.</i>

1067
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,410
<i>What should I tell 'em?</i>

1068
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:47,330
Tell 'em if they wanna talk to Parker,
follow protocol. Call the CIA.

1069
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:48,290
Tell them that.

1070
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:51,410
<i>- I knew it. You were spies the whole time.</i>
No, we're not.

1071
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:54,000
<i>Sure. Sure. Yeah.
Just what a spy would say.</i>

1072
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,040
<i>So listen, Not-A Spy,</i>

1073
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,290
<i>I'm thinking about throwing
a grand opening during the holidays.</i>

1074
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:01,830
<i>Can you make it back to Creation for that?</i>

1075
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:04,290
Um... Yeah.

1076
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,450
Yeah, I'll try.

1077
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:08,700
<i>Do or do not, fool.</i>

1078
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,000
Catch you later, kiddo. Gotta go.

1079
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,370
<i>- </i> [Mike] <i>See ya.</i>
- Bye.

1080
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:20,370
You good?

1081
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:23,450
Yeah.

1082
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:25,370
I'm always good.

1083
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:29,620
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
