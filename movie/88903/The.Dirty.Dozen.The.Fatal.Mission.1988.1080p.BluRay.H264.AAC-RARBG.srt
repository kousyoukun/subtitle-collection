1
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,063
他有点晚了
He's a little late.

2
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,361
我们早一点着陆  长官
We landed a bit early, sir.

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,659
你信任这个家伙  少校
You trust this guy, major?

4
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:16,451
我从未见过他
I've never seen him.

5
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:19,742
美国情报机构称他是冠军
U.S. Intelligence says he's a champion.

6
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,750
你可以称之为  好德国人
What you might call a "good German."

7
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:38,847
全靠他的寂寞
All by his lonesome.

8
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,263
美丽的
Beautiful.

9
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:00,329
看…
Look...

10
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:02,574
我们不能让他们活着
we can't let them take him alive.

11
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,995
走吧
Let's go.

12
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:55,049
20420
Twenty-four twenty.

13
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,713
20420什么  上尉
Twenty-four twenty what, captain?

14
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,391
他想告诉你一些事情
He was trying to tell you something.

15
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:16,947
你一定认识到路德维希船长
You do realize that Captain Ludwig

16
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:19,868
是卡纳里斯上将的私人工作人员
was on the personal staff of Admiral Canaris

17
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:22,277
管道进入德国海军情报局
and the pipeline into German naval intelligence?

18
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:25,621
他也是我父亲在战争前的亲密私人朋友
He was also a close personal friend of my father's before the war.

19
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,911
哦  也许你们两个应该把他留在海军上将的队伍里
Oh, maybe you two should have left him on the admiral's staff.

20
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:30,580
不  我们不能那样做
No, we couldn't do that.

21
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:34,289
他的信息太重要了  我们得设法把他救出来
His information was too important. We had to try to get him out.

22
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,969
二十
Twenty?

23
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,214
对你有什么意义  克拉克  不
Mean anything to you, Clark? No.

24
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,177
但我已经把它传递给了英国和自由的法国情报机构
But I've passed it on to British and Free French intelligence.

25
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,431
当我们到达伦敦时  他们可能会给我们一些东西
They may have something for us when we get to London.

26
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:02,066
轻松  女孩  你不能离开没有矮子
Easy, girl, you can't leave without Shorty.

27
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,558
中尉  你认为你能支持我们吗
Lieutenant, do you think you could back up and get us out of this?

28
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:13,077
现在  抓住它  我们的家伙有一个很棒的左手
Now, hold it. Our guy's got a great left hand.

29
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:21,178
有人做某事
Somebody do something!

30
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:35,396
让我走  典型的士兵的行为
Let me go. Typical enlisted men's behaviour.

31
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,858
在酒吧打架自杀
Getting themselves killed in a bar fight

32
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,521
对一些妓女的偏爱
over the questionable favours of some street whore.

33
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,692
我不能同意你更多的意见  先生
I couldn't agree with you more, sir.

34
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,410
少校  我听到你说的对吗
Do I hear you right, major?

35
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,785
你  失败者的冠军
You, the champion of the underdog?

36
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:51,036
嗯  你知道  一个流浪汉和一个穿着制服的醉汉仍然是个流浪汉和醉鬼  先生
Well, you know, a bum and a drunk in uniform is still a bum and a drunk, sir.

37
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:55,786
肖蒂  你还好吗
Shorty? You okay?

38
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,421
-你们在干什么  冠军  帮我一把
- What are you guys doing? - Champ, give me a hand.

39
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,264
把它放在那儿
Hold it there.

40
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,223
坚持住  伙计们
Hold it there, men.

41
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,717
打破它  我马上就回来
Break it up. I'll be back in a minute.

42
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,721
我要逮捕那些人
I want those men arrested.

43
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,225
你想逮捕他们
You want them arrested?

44
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,063
是啊  我敢打赌一个月的工资  他们今天早上在警卫室里
Yeah. I'll bet a month's salary that they were in the guardhouse this morning.

45
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:18,393
我只是想确保他们今晚回到警卫室
I just want to make sure they're back in the guardhouse tonight.

46
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:19,816
你看见那个大家伙了吗
You see that big guy?

47
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,442
也得到了一个地狱般的权利
Got a hell of a right too.

48
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,359
我们下一个任务很方便
Come in very handy on our next mission.

49
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:29,703
原谅我  将军  但是我认为少校的任务太多了
Forgive me, general, but I think the major's gone on one mission too many.

50
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,752
不  上校  还没有
No, colonel, not yet.

51
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,248
不仅如此
Not just yet.

52
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,835
从德国最高司令部的观点来看
In the viewpoint of the German High Command,

53
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:46,428
日本未能在珍珠港取得胜利
the Japanese failed to follow up their victory at Pearl Harbour

54
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,516
而且现在不被认为是值得信赖的盟友
and are not now considered to be trustworthy allies.

55
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:53,932
他们也意识到盟军战争的努力现在是完全专注的
They are also aware that the Allied war effort is now totally dedicated

56
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:56,858
粉碎德国  然后转向日本
to crushing Germany before turning to the Japanese.

57
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:59,731
最高指挥官认为战争可能会持续几年
The High Command feels the war might go on for years

58
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:03,070
德国仍有可能输掉这场战争
and that Germany could still conceivably lose the war.

59
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,692
现在  那些将军们并不急于和他们分享这一切
Now, those generals were in no rush to share all this with the f黨rer.

60
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:09,027
保持自己的活力
Keeping themselves alive, sort of.

61
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:10,615
对
Yes.

62
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:14,451
最终  他们吞下了他们的容貌骄傲
Ultimately, they swallowed their Junker pride,

63
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:17,581
他们就把这句话传给这个人：
and they took the word to this man:

64
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:23,128
Kurt Richter将军
SS General Kurt Richter,

65
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:26,469
一个希特勒暗暗信任的人
a man whom Hitler has come to trust implicitly.

66
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,723
他们使李希特相信这是他的职责
They convinced Richter that it was his duty

67
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:32,098
把真相告诉被告
to inform the f黨rer about the truth.

68
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:33,931
他这样做了
He did so.

69
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:38,054
但他也对F的下一个问题提出了答案：
But he also worked out an answer to the f黨rer's next question:

70
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:40,440
德国如何确保最后胜利
"How does Germany ensure a final victory?"

71
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,814
确切地  用瓦尔基里行动
Exactly. With Operation Valkyrie.

72
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,278
第四帝国  先生们
The Fourth Reich, gentlemen.

73
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,818
李希特想出了一个清单
Richter had come up with a list

74
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:52,577
十几个男人  所有德国顶级天才
of a dozen men, all top German geniuses

75
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:57,291
在政府  科学  军事  警察  教育方面
in government, science, the military, police, education.

76
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:00,248
他们都在35岁以下
All of them under 35

77
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,830
他们都是忠诚的纳粹分子
and all of them loyal Nazis.

78
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:06,544
新影子政府的存在
The existence of this new shadow government

79
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
由我们在德国海军情报局的联络员证实
was confirmed by our contacts in the German naval intelligence.

80
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,296
在过去的几个月里
In the past few months

81
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:14,013
包围斯大林格勒的德军投降了
the German army surrounding Stalingrad has surrendered

82
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:16,642
美国海军在太平洋上仍然是不可战胜的
and the U.S. Navy remains unbeatable in the Pacific.

83
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:20,183
F R已经做出了决定
The f黨rer has made the decision.

84
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:23,017
这12个人
These 12 men

85
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:26,778
站在旁边  被召唤到德国的慕尼黑  一时间通知
are standing by to be summoned to Munich, Germany at a moment's notice.

86
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,531
从那里  他们将继续乘火车
From there, they will go on by train

87
00:07:29,702 --> 00:07:33,652
沿着现在悬挂的东方快车的路线
along the route of the now suspended Orient Express.

88
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:40,125
威尼斯  的里雅斯特  贝尔格莱德  索非亚…
Venice, Trieste, Belgrade, Sofia...

89
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:43,047
最后  伊斯坦布尔
and finally, Istanbul.

90
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:45,124
在那里  他们将建立
And there, they will establish

91
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:50,543
超过10年  20  一个世纪  如果必要的话
over 10 years, 20, a century, if necessary

92
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:53,214
整个中东…
all over the Middle East...

93
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:56,348
新的第四帝国
the new Fourth Reich.

94
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:01,098
你将招收12名普通犯人
You will tak e 12 general prisoners

95
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:04,229
判处死刑  或者长期监禁
convicted and sentenced to death or to long terms of imprisonment.

96
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,526
你将训练和鉴定囚犯
You will train and qualify the prisoners

97
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,615
然后秘密地把他们送来
and deliver them secretly behind the lines.

98
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:12,950
你会攻击并摧毁你指定的目标

99
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,579
任何违反安全的行为

100
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,823
任何纪律的失败

101
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:19,572
囚犯们马上回到他们来的地方
and the prisoners go right back where they came from

102
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:22,421
对句子的简易执行
for summary execution of sentence.

103
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,926
我想单独和Stern谈谈
I want to speak to Private Stern alone.

104
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,396
这是命令
That's an order.

105
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,101
你在找另一个肮脏的人吗  少校
You looking for another Dirty Dozen, major?

106
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,947
不  不  不  我只是在等待时间  直到我成为将军
No, no, no. I'm just biding my time until I become general

107
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,439
让战争结束  现在发生了什么事
and get the war over. Now, what happened?

108
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:53,481
和酒吧里的一个军官打架

111
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:00,124
哦  那太精明了  他说了什么让你不高兴
Oh, that's very shrewd. Now, what did he say to upset you?

112
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,044
我们开始讨论种族问题
We got into a discussion about race.

113
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,503
我告诉他他属于另一边
I told him he belonged on the other side.

114
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:09,216
我懂了  所以你又回到了一个军事监狱
I see. So you wind up in a military prison again

115
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:12,469
你面临另一个军事法庭  现在  看
and you're facing another court-martial. Now, look.

116
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:14,132
你知道的
You know...

117
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,928
我会给你一个机会打败这一切  回到战争中去
I'll give you a chance to beat this thing and get back to the war.

118
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,761
您说什么  你想要还是不想要
What do you say? Do you want it or not?

119
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:21,012
我不知道  少校
I don't know, major.

120
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:23,979
你会杀了很多人
You get a lot of men killed.

121
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,525
你杀了很多好人
You kill a lot of good people.

122
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:30,276
我再也不知道这对你来说是好事还是坏事
And I don't know anymore whether it's good versus evil with you.

123
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,825
也许这只是邪恶与邪恶
Maybe it's just evil versus evil.

124
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,068
我去找你的管理员
I'll find your keeper.

125
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:41,574
走吧
Let's go!

126
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,173
少校  跟我一起散步
Take a walk with me, major.

127
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,300
我有一些重要的信息要告诉你
I've got some important information for you.

128
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,012
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:00,601
早上好  中尉
Nice morning, lieutenant.

130
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,228
对  是的  是的
Yes. Yes, it is.

131
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:05,393
你为将军工作  是吗  这是正确的
You work for the general, huh? That's right.

132
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,686
你以前和莱特少校在一起吗
You've been with Major Wright before?

133
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,268
这是正确的  我又回来了
That's right. And I made it back.

134
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,527
战争结束了  中尉
War's over for me, lieutenant.

135
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,461
嗯  我不会说战争已经结束了  嗯
Well, I wouldn't say that the war is altogether over for you, hmm.

136
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:31,666
不是战争地狱吗  中尉
Ain't war hell, lieutenant?

137
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,214
当德国人在1918投降的时候
And when the Germans surrendered in 1918,

138
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,713
法国人把他们带到一辆火车车厢里
the French brought them down to a railroad car

139
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,384
在密西西比的森林里
in the forest of Compi間ne.

140
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:42,263
恐怕我还没来得及
Little bit before my time, I'm afraid.

141
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:44,761
当法国人在1940投降的时候
And when the French surrendered in 1940,

142
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:48,687
希特勒从老东方快车上订购了同一辆铁路车
Hitler ordered that same railroad car from the old Orient Express

143
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:50,733
回到同样的地点
brought back to the exact same spot.

144
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,228
哦  法国人这次能感觉到刺刀了吗
Oh, so that the French could feel the bayonet this time?

145
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:57,735
确切地  那辆车是2419号
Exactly. Now, that car was number 2419

146
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,737
现在在柏林
and it's in Berlin right now.

147
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,070
现在  我们的想法是
Now, the thinking is

148
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:04,573
那些德国人会炸掉那该死的东西
that those Germans will blow up that damn thing

149
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,743
在他们再次投降之前
before they'd ever surrender in it again.

150
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,378
但是怎么办呢
But how does?

151
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:11,749
2419后2420
After 2419 comes 2420.

152
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:17,418
新第四帝国的开国元勋
The founding fathers of the new Fourth Reich

153
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:22,223
将在伊斯坦布尔2420号车到达
will arrive in Istanbul in car number 2420.

154
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:24,931
现在我们知道这辆车在哪里了吗  坎贝尔上尉来了
Now we know where this car is now? Lt. Campbell's come up

155
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,262
一些新的空气侦察照片表明
with some new air recon photos that indicates

156
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,765
他们可能藏在慕尼黑的一个火车场里
they may be hidden in a train yard in Munich.

157
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:33,192
坎贝尔中尉显然是一位非常聪明的年轻女士
Lieutenant Campbell apparently is a very bright young lady.

158
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:34,441
为什么  她很聪明
Why, she's brilliant.

159
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:37,229
你知道  她是在这个德国贵族长大的
You know, she grew up in this German aristocracy

160
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:41,275
因为她的父亲是一名外交服务人员30年
because her father was a Foreign Service officer for 30 years.

161
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:44,242
该死  Marshal Rommel过去常在膝盖上弹她
Hell, Marshal Rommel used to bounce her on his knee.

162
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,740
在她18岁之前还是之后
Before or after she turned 18?

163
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,246
现在  现在
Now, now.

164
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:54,630

回到正轨
Get back in line.

179
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:52,102
少校说还会有一个
The major said there would be one more.

180
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:54,350
嗯  也许少校错了
Well, maybe the major was wrong.

181
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,484
那么我们就没有一打了
We don't have a dozen, then.

182
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,697
嘿  Joey  嘿  Stern
- Hey, Joey. - Hey, Stern.

183

你真倒霉  不是吗  乔
Pushing your luck, aren't you, Joe?

184
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:08,279
好的
All right.

185
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,121
叶的信仰如此渺小

You started off as a train engineer back home, Demchuk.

189
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:44,155
你知道  这种天赋可能会再次派上用场
You know, that talent may come in handy again.

190

我是个好工程师  先生

191
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,485
嗯
Uh-huh.

192
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,581
是的  但是在你结束这趟火车之前
Yeah, but before you handed the train in at the end of the day,

193
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:52,409
你开始抢劫乘客
you started robbing passengers.

194
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:55,420
我也是个火车强盗  长官
I was good train robber too, sir.

195
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:59,881
你要抢火车吗  少校  哦  不  不  不
You want to rob a train, major? Oh, no, no, no.

196
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,135

我敢打赌  Dravko  我敢打赌你有
I bet you have, Dravko. I just bet you have.

199
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,480
好的  Holt
All right, Holt.

200
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:31,032
到底是怎么回事  中士
What the hell is going on, sergeant?

201
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:35,667
我不知道  先生  我们通常只有在悬挂的时候才能得到这个
I don't know, sir. We usually only get this when there's a hanging.

202
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:05,147
汉弥尔顿有枪  对吧  这是正确的
Hamilton's got a gun, right? That's right.

203
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,482
打倒了议员们  守着它  把我们钉了下来
Knocked out the MPs guarding it and pinned us down.

204
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,325
我们可能不得不杀了那个男孩  哦  这可能需要一些帮助
We may have to kill that boy. Oh, that may take some doing.

205
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:13,454
他杀死了一个白人妇女
He killed a white woman.

206
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,410
他哪儿也找不到
He's not getting anywhere.

207
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:19,333
现在我们拿到了那辆装甲卡车  如果他想下来  我们会把他炸开的
Now we got that armoured truck back there. We'll blow him apart if he tries to get down.

208
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:22,422
你打算怎么办  炸毁监狱杀死囚犯
What are you gonna do? Blow up a prison to kill a prisoner?

209
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:24,880
谁在跟他说话  跟他说话
Who's been talking to him? Talking to him?

210
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:27,092
没错  跟他说话
That's right, talking to him.

211
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:29,885
现在你看  我要去那里做个交易
Now you look, I'm gonna go up there and make a deal.

212
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,975
我也要许下诺言
And I'm also gonna make a promise.

213
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:34,384
一定不要弄坏它  你明白吗
Make sure you don't break it. Do you understand?

214
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,975
你明白了
You got it.

215
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:41,191
汉弥尔顿
Hamilton?

216
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,068
汉密尔顿或哈密尔顿  这是Major Wright
Hamilton, this is Major Wright.

217
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:46,523
你知道我是谁  我知道你是谁
You know who I am and I know who you are.

218
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:00,621
汉弥尔顿
Hamilton?

219
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,077
我想和你谈谈
I wanna talk to you.

220
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,414
我最好现在就死
I'm better off dying right here and now.

221
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,553
我会有很多陪伴的
I'll have a lot of company.

222
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,047
现在  你急死了什么
Now, what's your rush in dying?

223
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:14,466
说话不能失去任何东西
You can't lose anything by talking.

224
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:25,684
可以
Okay.

225
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:27,523
那就来吧
Come ahead, then.

226
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:32,571
好吧  我要跟你打电话  汉弥尔顿
All right, I'm gonna lay it on the line with you, Hamilton.

227
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:37,039
我仍然可以使用一个可以突破安全单元的人
I can still use a man who can break out of a maximum-security cell,

228
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,666
站起来
get up there,

229
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:41,076
拿一把机关枪
and grab a machine gun.

230
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:44,248
几乎一路领先
Almost made it all the way.

231
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:47,665
据我所知  你还没有杀死一个MP
As far as I know, you haven't killed an MP

232
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:50,465
你无论如何都要绞死
and you're gonna hang anyway

233
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:52,429
不仅仅是
for a lot more than just

234
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:54,591
企图逃跑
an attempted escape.

235
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,843
你到底想从我这里得到什么
So, what the hell do you want from me?

236
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,394
你为什么杀了你的妻子
Why did you kill your wife?

237
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,847
管好你自己的事
Just mind your own business.

238
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:11,568
我在巴黎见过她
I met her in Paris.

239
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,909
战争爆发了
Then the war came.

240
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,787
我们到达伦敦
We made it to London.

241
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,790
于是我回到美国参军
So I went back to the U.S. To join the Army.

242
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:25,505
伙计  我打破了我的屁股回到这里
Man, I broke my butt to get back over here.

243
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:29,258
然后我去了她的公寓
Then I went to her apartment.

244
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,548
她和一位皇家空军船长住在一起
She was living with an RAF captain.

245
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,685
他拔出枪说：  黑鬼在英国不受欢迎
He pulled a gun and said, "Niggers ain't welcome in Britain."

246
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:43,932
然后她笑了
And then she laughed.

247
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,984
她笑了
She laughed.

248
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:50,644
你为什么不放下枪呢  投降  我向你保证…
Why don't you put down your gun. Surrender and I promise you...

249
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,992
早上你会和那些人一起训练
you'll be training with the men in the morning.

250
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,784
军队不会让你遵守诺言的
Army ain't gonna let you keep that promise.

251
00:17:56,954 --> 00:18:00,619
哦  是的  他们会的  他们需要我  我有消息告诉你：
Oh, yes, they will. They need me, and I got news for you:

252
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,665
他们也需要你
They need you too.

253
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,919
还有像你一样的11个邋遢鬼
Along with 11 other slobs just like you.

254
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:13,130
可以
Okay.

255
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:14,882
好吧  你想怎么做
Okay, how you wanna work it?

256
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:17,802
你指出  30口径的下限…
You point that.30 calibre downrange...

257
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,345
你跟着我回家
and you follow me home.

258
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:50,585
好的
All right.

259
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:52,881
大家排好队  数一数
Everybody line up and count off.

260
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:54,250

00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:02,472
好的
All right.

267
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,480
现在  通过你的出现  你已经表现出强烈的愿望
Now, by your presence, you've indicated a strong desire

268
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:08,684
自愿参加这个任务  这给了你三条路
to volunteer for this mission, which leaves you three ways to go.

269
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,110
训练时你会犯规
You can foul up during training,

270
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:14,564
在这种情况下  你将被送回监狱执行死刑
in which case you'll be sent back to prison for execution of sentence.

271
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,239
二  我的意思是  你可以在行动中犯规…
Two, I mean, you can foul up in action...

272
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,246
在这种情况下  我会亲自炸掉你的脑袋
in which case I will personally blow your brains out.

273
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,038
或者你可以做你被告知的事
Or you can do what you're told,

274
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,043
在这种情况下  你可以通过
in which case, you may just get by.

275
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,168
现在  如果你们中的任何人试图逃跑…
Now, if any one of you tries to escape...

276
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:32,542
你们将被送回执行死刑
you'll all be sent back for execution of sentence.

277
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:35,386
因此  你们都是互相依赖的
Therefore, you're all dependent on one another.

278
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,592
如果有人试图变得聪明
And if anybody tries to get smart,

279
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:39,756
你都会头脑清醒的  对吧
you'll all get it right in the head, right?

280
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:41,260
正确的
Right.

281
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:45,138
现在  由于这次任务的偶然性
Now, due to the contingency nature of this mission

282
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:49,606
汉弥尔顿私人关系的恶化
and the deteriorating relations between Private Hamilton

283
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:54,152
以及福布斯路监狱的工作人员和下院议员…
and the staff and the MPs of Forbes Road Prison...

284
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:56,897
你被派到这里去了
you've been sent out here into the field

285
00:19:57,074 --> 00:20:00,942
训练的性质也在加强
and the nature of your training has been intensified.

286
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,366
埃克维拉里亚
"Ekkevarria."

287
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:05,408
埃切瓦里  先生
Echevarria, sir.

288
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,787
拿起我的手跟着我
Pick up my grips and follow me.

289
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,457
好的  把他们送回兵营
All right. Have them sent back to the barracks.

290
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:15,459
是的  先生  好吧
Yes, sir. All right!

291
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,551
每个人都进入兵营
Everybody into the barracks.

292
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,344
如果你有什么可抱怨的
If you have something to complain about,

293
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:23,013
牧师的时间在4到5之间  走吧
the chaplain's hours are between 4 and 5. Let's go.

294
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:24,927
击中它
Hit it!

295
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:28,269
埃切瓦里  你对我来说是个谜  我查过你的档案了
Echevarria, you're a mystery to me. I went through your files.

296
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,159
你已经经历了一些相当沉重的事情
You've been through some pretty heavy stuff.

297
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:34,354
抢劫  一个黑帮绑架  用致命武器袭击
Robbery, a gangland kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon.

298
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,272
我的童年很糟糕  先生
I had a very bad childhood, sir.

299
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:37,989
嗯  我想出了类似的方法
Well, I figured something like that.

300
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:40,717
但直到那天晚上你从英格兰银行撤出
But until you made that night withdrawal from the Bank of England

301
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:43,151
用A.45和一点炸药…
with a.45 and a little dynamite...

302
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,820
你没有做过什么艰苦的事  是吗
you haven't done any heavy time, have you?

303
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:47,576
我总是表示真诚的悔恨  先生
I always express sincere remorse, sir.

304
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,781
当然可以
Sure you do.

305
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:52,660
我是说  假释官  法官…
I mean, parole officers, judges...

306
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:55,163
连警察都想让你休息一下
even cops wanted to give you a break.

307
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,380
嗯  伙计…我是说  少校
Well, man... I mean, major.

308
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:00,422
我总是想  当你去做的时候  全力以赴
I always figure, when you're going for it, go all out.

309
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,963
当你走在大街上时  你要发疯
When you're in the streets, raise hell.

310
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,225
但当他们得到你  他们得到了你
But when they get you, they got you.

311
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,097
好一点
Be nice.

312
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:12,015
就这些了吗  少校  就这样
Will that be all, major? That will be all.

313
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:13,644
我们不会在这里呆那么久
We won't be here that long.

314
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:16,273
很高兴为您效劳  先生
Well, glad to be of service, sir.

315
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,272
埃切瓦里…
Echevarria...

316
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:20,945
我的挖沟刀
my trench knife.

317
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,461
我是说  你要去哪里  第二次  他们绞死你
I mean, where you going? Second time around, they hang you.

318
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:46,549
今晚不能改变  少校
Can't change overnight, major.

319
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:50,518
我也不能
Neither can I.

320
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:54,356
起飞
Take off.

321
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:57,394
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

322
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:06,865
刀子  恢复
Knife! Recover!

323
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:10,406
刀子  恢复

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,751
坚持下去  孩子
Stick them, boy!

326
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:21,707
打死德国佬
Hit the kraut!

327
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:23,261

00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:29,266
撞上德国佬  宝贝

330
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:31,143
-是的  恢复

331
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:38,015

左边  恢复
Left! Recover!

334
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:46,027
把它们粘起来  肖蒂  -就是这样
- Stick them, Shorty! - That's it.

335
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:48,408
少校  他们从哪儿弄到你的守卫帽的
Where did they get your garrison cap, major?

336
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,536
我不知道  Stern
I don't know, Stern.

337
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,033
邪恶与邪恶  我猜
Evil versus evil, I guess.

338
00:22:57,421 --> 00:23:00,457
恢复  刀子
Recover! Knife!

339
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,376
坚持他  肖蒂
Stick him, Shorty!

340
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:07,467
再来一次  快点  肖蒂
Stick that kraut again! Come on, Shorty!

341
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,650
他的名字叫莱特少校
His name is Major Wright.

342
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:23,778
这是我们仅有的一部电影
This is the only film we have.

343
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:27,364
它是在一个濒死的新闻摄影师旁边找到的
It was found next to a dying newsreel cameraman.

344
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:30,950
这部电影是在袭击阿格里真托村时拍摄的
The film was made during an attack on the village of Agrigento

345
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:35,867
其中的目标被认为是本尼托·墨索里尼
in which the target is believed to have been Benito Mussolini.

346
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:41,586
我们的新联系人说  即使现在  这个军官正在训练另一个小组
Our new contact says that even now, this officer is training another group

347
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:44,628
被判死刑的美国囚犯
drawn from American prisoners sentenced to death

348
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,593
或长期监禁
or long terms of imprisonment.

349
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:53,219
整个故事看起来有点不可思议  将军
The whole story seems a little incredible, general.

350
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:56,644
你确定你不是在浪费钱吗  呃  这个线人
Are you sure you're not wasting money on this, uh, this informant?

351
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:59,601
这是我们在爱尔兰的高级代理商的意见
It is the opinion of our senior agent in Ireland

352
00:23:59,775 --> 00:24:01,768
这个故事是千真万确的
that the story is absolutely true.

353
00:24:01,944 --> 00:24:04,102
嗯  也许你是对的
Well, maybe you're right.

354
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,064
整个国家崇拜歹徒和歹徒
The whole country worships outlaws and gangsters.

355
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:11,359
我想他们现在已经把他们征召入伍了
Now they've drafted them into the Army, I suppose.

356
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:15,582
我已经安排好从这个告密者那里收到更多的报告
I've made arrangements to receive further reports from this informant.

357
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,205
我们将提供所有必要的技术设备
And we will supply all necessary technical equipment

358
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:20,204
未来需要传输
needed for transmission in the future.

359
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:26,212
请稍等片刻
One moment, please.

360
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,674
帝国总理  将军
The Reich's chancellery, general.

361
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:32,216
李希特将军
General Richter.

362
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:36,516
是的  我很喜欢
Yes, mein F躧rer.

363
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:39,181
不  我不会有问题的
No, mein F躧rer, it will not be a problem.

364
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:42,227
我们将于九月三日在伊斯坦布尔
We shall be in Istanbul on September the 3rd.

365
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:46,070
是的  我很喜欢
Yes, mein F躧rer.

366
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:47,732
谢谢您
Thank you.

367
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:50,550
如果没有更多的事情  先生们…
If there is nothing further, gentlemen...

368
00:24:50,618 --> 00:24:53,287
你真的相信这个人可以接受
And you honestly believe that this man can take

369
00:24:53,454 --> 00:24:57,119
一群不称职的杀人犯…
a bunch of misfits, murderers...

370
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,326
和普通小偷
and common thieves

371
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:02,871
把他们变成一个有凝聚力的战斗机器
and turn them into a cohesive fighting machine?

372
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:08,003
哦  这不是一个完全原创的概念  先生们：
Oh, it is not an entirely original concept, gentlemen:

373
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:11,174
该死的军团
A "legion of the damned."

374
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:19,179
通常  我是第一个出去的人
Ordinarily, I'd be the first man out,

375
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:22,272
但这是我们的处女航
but since this is our maiden voyage,

376
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:25,015
Holt中士将履行这些荣誉
Sergeant Holt will do the honours.

377
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:27,154
怎么了  穆兹  你看起来有点紧张
What's the matter, Mu馿z? You seem a little tense.

378
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,197
我签约杀死德国人  而不是跳出飞机
I signed up to kill Germans, not jump out of planes.

379
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:31,611
错了
Wrong.

380
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:33,942
你本来是该下去的
You were due to go down one way or another.

381
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,738
在绳子的末端有六英尺  或者离飞机有6000英尺
Either six foot at the end of a rope, or 6000 feet from an airplane.

382
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:40,916
瞧  你自己赚了不少钱
Look, you got yourself a good deal.

383
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,118
我拿到好价钱后会告诉你的  少校
I'll let you know when I got a good deal, major.

384
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,005
现在  一般来说  你有好几天的准备时间
Now, ordinarily, you'd have several days for preparation

385
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:52,964
你的第一次跳伞是在白天进行的
and your first jump would have been in the daytime.

386
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:55,760
但是没有时间  你的下一跳现在
But there is no time. Your next jump now

387
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:59,178
将在夜间进入南斯拉夫
will be at night and into Yugoslavia.

388
00:26:01,147 --> 00:26:02,392
连接你的电缆
Attach your cables.

389
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,522
祝你好运
Good luck.

390
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:14,778
去吧
Go!

391
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,286
达哥斯蒂诺
D'Agostino?

392
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,997
你到底怎么了  达哥斯蒂诺
What the hell's wrong with you, D'Agostino?

393
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:26,416
我不会跳  少校
I can't jump, major.

394
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,498
我从来就不擅长高处  我做不到
I never been any good at heights. I can't do it.

395
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,832
告诉某人  这是个地狱  士兵
It's a hell of a time to tell somebody, soldier!

396
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,417
站起来跳  不  少校
Get up there and jump! No, major.

397
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,220
我不能  我会被杀的  我知道
I can't. I'll get killed, I know it.

398
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:39,850
你想让每个人都知道热门的辛迪加袭击了人…
You want everybody to know that the hotshot syndicate hit man...

399
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:41,976
有一英里长的黄色条纹吗
has a yellow streak a mile long?

400
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:43,770
我不能跳  少校
I can't jump, major!

401
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:45,731
你太酷了
You're so cool.

402
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,351
你甚至给了他们最后一根烟
You even offered them a last drag from your own cigarette

403
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:51,568
就在你开动脑筋之前
just before you blew their brains out.

404
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:53,281
你想要香烟吗  跳  你这个流浪汉
You want a cigarette? Jump, you bum.

405
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:56,201
我得走了  我会冻住我的腿  加油  我们走吧
I got to go. I'll freeze my leg. Come on! Let's get going!

406
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:57,946
-移动或挤奶  -来吧
- Move it or milk it. - Come on.

407
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,611
-来吧  移动它  这里已经结冰了
- Come on, move it. - It's freezing up here.

408
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:10,546
来吧  我们走吧  杰罗尼莫
Come on, let's move! Geronimo!

409
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:22,425
要再看看欧洲  对吧  霍夫曼
Gotta be a nicer way to see Europe again, right, Hoffman?

410
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:25,639
嗨  少校  我是一个全美国男孩
Hey, major, I'm an all-American boy.

411
00:27:25,815 --> 00:27:28,650
我的父母只是四处游逛
My parents just travelled around a lot.

412
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:41,985
哦  天哪
Oh, my God!

413
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,584
昨晚…
Last night...

414
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,580
霍夫曼反弹后
after Hoffman bounced

415
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:52,922
我把他的尸体带回来了  还有他的降落伞
I had his body brought back here, along with his parachute.

416
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:55,630
你认为这不仅仅是一次常规的训练事故  少校
You think this was more than a routine training accident, major?

417
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:58,590
我现在知道了  中尉  这不是意外
I know now, lieutenant, that it was no accident.

418
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:01,089
霍夫曼降落伞上的降落伞线被切断了
The chute line on Hoffman's parachute was cut.

419
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:04,849
他跳伞时跳得很好
He jumped out of that plane with the jump ring in perfect position

420
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,598
溜槽仍然没有打开
and the chute still didn't open.

421
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:09,016
我以为那些人装了自己的滑道
I thought the men packed their own chutes.

422
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:11,599
不  你说的是伞兵  中尉
No, you're talking about paratroopers, lieutenant.

423
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,569
我的人是小偷和杀人犯
My men are thieves and murderers.

424
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:16,988
这些是预先折叠  并由跳转教练在飞机上
These are prefolded and put on an airplane by jump instructors.

425
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:19,399
任何人都可以得到霍夫曼的降落伞
Anybody could have got to Hoffman's parachute,

426
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:21,285
甚至帮了他一把
even helped him on with it.

427
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:24,241
你自己说的  少校  你有小偷和杀人犯
You said it yourself, major. You've got thieves and murderers.

428
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,216
所以他们中的一个找到了另一个杀人的理由
So one of them found a reason to kill another.

429
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,891
这就是我半夜把我弄出来的原因吗
Is that a reason for getting me out here in the middle of the night?

430
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,126
不  我的理由是霍夫曼是我的一个男人
No. My reason is Hoffman was one of my men.

431
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:32,839
他非常重要
And he was very important.

432
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:34,287
他讲德语
He spoke German.

433
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:37,586
他在欧洲旅行多年  熟悉南斯拉夫
He travelled in Europe for years and he was familiar with Yugoslavia,

434
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,671
这对我有很大帮助
which would have been a great help to me.

435
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:42,053
那么你是说你需要时间去寻找替代品
So you're saying you need time to find a replacement?

436
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:45,427
没有时间了  上校  纳粹会转移那些人
There is no time, colonel. The Nazis are gonna move those people.

437
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:48,515
少校  你说霍夫曼在欧洲呆了几年
Major, you say that Hoffman spent years in Europe,

438
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:50,895
拿起语言  他知道巴尔干半岛
picking up languages, he knew the Balkans.

439
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:53,818
我在欧洲长大  我会说很多欧洲语言
I grew up in Europe. I speak many European languages

440
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:56,607
我在Balkans和南斯拉夫度过了六个夏天
and I spent six summers in the Balkans and Yugoslavia.

441
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,780
显然  不管出于什么原因  中尉  你想继续执行这个任务
Apparently, for whatever reason, lieutenant, you want to go on this mission.

442
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:02,950
让我给你指出点什么
Let me point something out to you.

443
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,204
现在  剩下的训练和敌后
Now, for the rest of the training and behind enemy lines,

444
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:09,825
你的生活将完全取决于在书中犯下一切罪行的人
your life will totally depend on men who've committed every crime in the book,

445
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:12,707
包括强奸和谋杀  现在  你还想去吗
including rape and murder. Now, do you still want to go?

446
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:25,994
嘿  萨奇  今晚有谁在看电影
Hey, sarge, who's in the movies tonight?

447

449
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:31,433
来吧  让我们摆脱寒冷
Come on, let's get out of the cold.

450
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:34,524
在霍夫曼弹跳后  少校为什么要起飞
How come the major took off with Hoffman's chute after he bounced?

451
00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:36,520
我与专业相处的方式
The way I get along with the major

452
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:39,068
每当我有一个大的  肥胖的问题给他…

453
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,279
我完全忘记了这件事
I forget all about it.

454
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:43,236
嘿  看  这儿有个女的

先生  要不要让它继续  是啊
Shall I let it continue, sir? Yeah...

507
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:24,645
不妨看看另一半的生活

He's got a.45 carbine, lots of ammo.

然后我们在营房找到警卫  我们得到他的酒吧
Then we get the guard at the barracks and we get his BAR.

We grab a boat, we get to Ireland, we pull a few jobs, get a stake.

Hey, that's a great idea. Are you crazy?

518
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:07,564
你说得对  这是个馊主意
You're right. It's a lousy idea.

519
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,354
谁主修专业
Who sticks the major?

520
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:13,158
我以为你会这么做的  达哥斯蒂诺
I thought you'd do that, D'Agostino.

521
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:15,660

把刀子给我

523
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,086

Are you nuts? You'll get all three of us killed

524
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:26,747
然后把其他十字架钉死  那么你来这里干什么
and then crucify the others too. What did you come out here for, then?

525
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:28,171
因为你问过我们
Because you asked us.

526
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:30,632
我们想看看有多少人疯了
And we wanted to see how many other men were crazy.

527
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:32,846
是的  没错  我们没那么疯狂
Yeah, that's right. We ain't that crazy.

00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:22,185
是的  我没事
Yeah, I'm all right.

532
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:25,227
嘿  这些家伙不好
Hey, these guys ain't nice.

533
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:27,773
嘿  现在  回到你的床铺…
Hey. Now, go on back to your bunks...

534
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,650
不要再有任何聪明的想法
and don't get any more bright ideas.

535
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:36,823
晚安  少校
Good night, major.

536
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,041
走的路  冠军
Way to go, champ.

537
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:44,961
走吧  伙计  好的
Way to go, buddy. All right.

538
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,516
现在  只要记住  如果这是真的
Now, just remember, if this was the real thing

539
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:04,522
你移动得太快了  你会被工程师发现的…
and you move too soon, you'd be spotted by the engineers...

540
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:07,349
或者德国乘客在车内
or the German passengers inside the cars.

541
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,433
他们会把火车停下来  把我们铲起来
They'd stop the train and just scoop us up

542
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:13,732
我们永远也不会接近任何我们想要接近的人
and we'd never get near anybody we want to get on it.

543
00:35:18,787 --> 00:35:20,661
采取立场
Take positions.

544
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:53,353
根据数字  一个…
By the numbers. One...

545
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:56,742
二  三  四…
two, three, four...

546
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,236
五  六…
five, six...

547
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:01,908
七…
seven...

548
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:08,451
八  九  10, 11, 12
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

549
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:43,662
-好的  搬回去
- All right. - Moving back.

550
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,200
这里谁负责  好吧  掉下来
Who's in charge here? All right, fall out.

551
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:51,960
卡车在哪里
Where the hell's the truck?

552
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:56,041
看  少校来了
Look, here comes the major.

553
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:09,145
好吧  你干得不错
All right, you did a good job.

554
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,646
我对你的工作相当满意
And I'm reasonably happy with your work.

555
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:14,771
这辆卡车在这里  一半是酒
This truck here, it's half full of booze.

556
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:17,314
掉下来
Fall out.

557
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,574
好的  Collins  埃切瓦里…
All right. Collins, Echevarria...

558
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:22,819
放下后门
drop the tailgate.

559
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:25,782
小心货物
And careful with the cargo.

560
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:34,835
嘿  就这样  宝贝
Hey, that's it, baby.

561
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:37,130
我想你可以处理所有这些
I assume you can handle all of that.

562
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:40,922
现在  姑娘们  你们的首相期待着
Now, girls, your prime minister is looking forward

563
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:43,176
来装饰你们每一个人
to decorating each and every one of you individually.

564
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:44,973
好的  快点吧
Okay, so hurry it up.

565
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:49,348
好看  很好
Good-looking. Good.

566
00:37:49,522 --> 00:37:51,182
给我一个  -你走吧
- Give me one. - Here you go.

567
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:57,354
我叫Lonnie
My name's Lonnie.

568
00:37:58,113 --> 00:37:59,773
我知道该带你去哪儿  小心
I know where to take you. Be careful.

569
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,194
嘿  看着它
Hey, watch it.

570
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:03,195
你把袜子带来尼龙
You brought stockings in nylon?

571
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:05,824
- Baby  这是另外一个
- Baby. - Here's another one.

572
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:09,450
弗雷迪
Freddie!

573
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:13,912
我找到了你  亲爱的  你看起来很棒
I've found you, love. You look great.

574
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:15,333
给我们一个吻
Give us a kiss.

575
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:20,216
那么你像我们的突击队员吗
Are you something like our commandos, then?

576
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:23,055
早上告诉我  宝贝  好吗
Tell me about it in the morning, baby, okay?

577
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:34,806
宝贝  我从晚上开始就没跳舞了  来吧
Baby, I haven't danced since grad night. Come on.

578
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,905
是的  就是这样  我简直不敢相信
- Yeah, that's it. - I can't believe it!

579
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,620
我们还没有正式介绍
We haven't been formally introduced yet.

580
00:38:55,796 --> 00:38:57,872
胭脂红
Carmine D'Agostino.

581
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:27,986
好了  中尉  少校似乎有
Well, lieutenant, the major appears to have

582
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:30,700
某种不同寻常的夜间演习正在进行中
some kind of unusual night manoeuvre in progress.

583
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:33,162
是的  先生  我相信他把它称为
Yes, sir. I believe he referred to it as

584
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,291
改善与盟国的关系
"improving relations with our allies."

585
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:36,955
的确
Indeed.

586
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:47,173
上校  好吧  我没想到会在野外看到你
Colonel. Well, I didn't expect to see you out in the field, so to speak.

587
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:50,135
我看得出来  不用了  谢谢
I can see that. No, thank you.

588
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:53,429
你意识到这个小小的狂欢会让你受到法庭审判
You realize this little orgy could get you court-martialled.

589
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:56,142
这些被判犯有死刑罪的囚犯
These are sentenced prisoners convicted of capital crimes.

590
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:59,814
他们也准备战斗了  上校  来吧  让他们休息一下
They're also ready for battle, colonel. Come on, give them a break.

591
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:02,144
少校  如果你能忍耐撕裂自己
Major, if you could bear to tear yourself away,

592
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:04,479
将军正在路上等你
the general is waiting for you down the road.

593
00:40:04,657 --> 00:40:06,115
哦  他想参加聚会吗
Oh, did he want to join the party?

594
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:07,908
Collins
Collins.

595
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:10,200
运气好  士兵
Get lucky, soldier.

596
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,823
你要见我  少校  我有个问题  先生
You wanted to see me, major? I've got a problem, sir.

597
00:40:17,002 --> 00:40:19,458
我们有好几个  我们有两份报告
We have several. We have two reports.

598
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,172
一个来自南斯拉夫内部
One from inside Yugoslavia

599
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,543
表明在所有主要城市突然增加了安全性
indicating suddenly increased security in all the major cities.

600
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:27,638
嗯  你选择南斯拉夫是因为它在主要东方快车路线上
Well, you picked Yugoslavia because it's on the main Orient Express route.

601
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:29,844
这是正确的  游击队在等你
That's right. And the partisans are expecting you.

602
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:31,344
但第二次报道
But the second report

603
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:35,562
是纳粹开始了解你自己以及你的所作所为
is that the Nazis are beginning to learn about you personally and what you do.

604
00:40:35,729 --> 00:40:37,521
嗯  我并不感到惊讶
Well, I'm not surprised.

605
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,232
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

606
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,725
将军  我在这里问过你  因为我相信我们组有叛徒
General, I asked you here because I believe there's a traitor in our group.

607
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:43,942
你知道他是谁吗  不  还没有
Do you know who he is? No, not yet.

608
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:46,070
但他得到了霍夫曼的降落伞
But he got to Hoffman's parachute

609
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,612
他在南斯拉夫对我来说是无价之宝
and he would have been invaluable to me in Yugoslavia.

610
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:50,029
我浏览了文件夹
I went through the folders.

611
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:52,693
霍夫曼根本不可能遇到这些人
And there's no way that Hoffman could've met any of these men

612
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:54,532
在来到军事监狱之前
before coming to the military prison.

613
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:56,952
不  德国人下令杀戮
No, the Germans ordered the killing.

614
00:40:57,126 --> 00:41:00,246
但是纳粹怎么可能知道你要挑选谁来完成这项任务呢
But how could the Nazis possibly have known who you were going to pick for the mission?

615
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:03,291
他们不能  很明显  我们的Somebody先生
They couldn't. Obviously, our Mr. Somebody,

616
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:06,716
我派他去执行任务后  他和德国人取得了联系
he got in touch with the Germans after I assigned him to the mission.

617
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:09,507
你知道有一部蓝色电影偷偷进入营地吗
You know there was a blue film smuggled into the camp?

618
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,471
如果你能在……走私一部蓝色电影
And if you can smuggle a blue film in...

619
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:14,298
你当然可以把信息偷运出去
you certainly can smuggle a message out.

620
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:16,137
然后我们必须中止任务
Then we have to abort the mission.

621
00:41:16,312 --> 00:41:17,889
我们该怎么做  克拉克
How do we do that, Clark?

622
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:21,064
第三帝国的继承人今晚离开慕尼黑
The heirs apparent to the Third Reich leave Munich tonight.

623
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:24,651
他们将在三天内到达伊斯坦布尔
They'll arrive in Istanbul in three days.

624
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:30,241
那是一个聚会
That's some party.

625
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:32,237
你为什么不加入我们呢
Why don't you join us?

626
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:35,994
如果我参加那个聚会  恐怕我会失去我的酒吧
If I joined that party, I'm afraid I'd lose my bars.

627
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:41,288
Lieutenant Campbell  你当军官多久了
How long have you been an officer, Lieutenant Campbell?

628
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:43,086
五个月
Five months.

629
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:44,797
我得到了直接的佣金
I was given a direct commission

630
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:47,291
因为我有一定的技能和教育…
because I have certain skills and education...

631
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:49,875
在上面和上面需要什么
over and above what's needed there.

632
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:52,255
你就像其他肮脏的人一样
You're just like the rest of the Dirty Dozen.

633
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:54,091
是啊  我们都有一定的技能
Yeah. We all got certain skills

634
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:55,547
还有教育
and education too.

635
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:57,683
你知道什么是讽刺吗
You know what's ironic?

636
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:01,929
那些人犯了罪  他们被关进监狱…
Those men committed crimes, they were put in prison...

637
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:04,480
他们完成了这个任务
and they got this mission.

638
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:08,941
我会愿意付出我所拥有的一切
I would've been willing to give everything I have.

639
00:42:09,114 --> 00:42:10,525
也许是我的生活
Maybe my life.

640
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:14,613
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

641
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,615
不  不要停下来
No. Don't stop now.

642
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,838
爸爸是一名外国服务人员
By dad is a Foreign Service officer.

643
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,800
他在奥斯陆驻扎时娶了一位挪威妇女
He married a Norwegian woman when he was stationed in Oslo.

644
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,464
纳粹袭击挪威的时候
When the Nazis hit Norway,

645
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:35,841
我母亲回家把家人带出去了
my mother had gone home to get her family out.

646
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:39,223
她在第一次轰炸中丧生
She died in the first bombing raid.

647
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:42,224
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

648
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:52,440
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

649
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:55,696
现在  我们可以尝试在空旷的火车上进行空袭
Now, we can try an air strike at the train in open country,

650
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,993
但我们不能肯定他们会得到12个
but we can't be sure they'd get all 12.

651
00:42:58,164 --> 00:43:01,497
然后  我们可以把它交给亚历山大市的英国情报部门
And then, we could give this to British intelligence at Alexandria.

652
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:04,158
嘿  等一下  我的人呢
Hey, wait a minute. How about my men?

653
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:07,171
我的意思是  他们一直在努力工作  他们准备出发了
I mean, they've been working damn hard and they're ready to go!

654
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:11,586
我的工作人员是对的  你真的成了他们中的一员
My staff is right. You really do become one of them.

655
00:43:14,513 --> 00:43:17,348
他们必须回到监狱  现在等一下  将军
They'd have to go back to prison. Now wait a minute, general.

656
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:20,138
如果你把这些人送回去死
If you send these men back to do time and die,

657
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:21,971
你的手上会发生骚乱
you're gonna have a riot on your hands.

658
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,347
也许你是对的  我可能会站在他们一边
And you may be right. I might be fighting on their side.

659
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,320
你到底要什么  少校  你有一个叛徒在你的小组  你不知道是谁
What the hell do you want, major? You've got a traitor in your group and you don't know who it is.

660
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,486
我不知道是谁  但在某个地方
I don't know who it is, but somewhere down the line

661
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:32,314
我会查出是谁  然后除掉他
I'll find out who it is and get rid of him.

662
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,775
除了炸毁纳粹或死亡尝试
Besides blowing up the Nazis or die trying.

663
00:43:36,035 --> 00:43:39,867
这是游戏的名称  当谈到肮脏的打
And that's the name of the game when it comes to the Dirty Dozen.

664
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:47,496
除了喝酒和嫖妓…
Besides drinking and whoring...

665
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:49,711
摔倒了
and falling down.

666
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:52,420
其中一个是叛徒
And one of them is a traitor.

667
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:20,367
我们正在接近跳跃区  少校
We're approaching the jump area, major.

668
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:23,242
我们随时都会打开准备好的灯
We'll be turning on the ready light at any moment.

669
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:25,244
让我们看看
Let's see.

670
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,955
坐标4135-1792  对吗
Coordinates 4135-2794, is that right?

671
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:30,038
当然可以  先生  有什么问题吗
Well, of course, sir. Any problem?

672
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:33,250
不  不  不  没问题  除非我们不跳
No, no, no. No problem. Except we're not gonna jump there.

673
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:36,926
是的  我想让你改变斯科普里南部5度
Yes, I want you to change course 5 degrees south of Skopje

674
00:44:37,096 --> 00:44:40,714
绕过跳跃区域约20英里  你明白了吗
and bypass the jump area by some 20 miles. Have you got that?

675
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,551
先生  这一切都很不规则  你在破坏计划
This is all very irregular, sir. You're breaking the plan.

676
00:44:42,726 --> 00:44:46,392
嗯  我的整个团队都是不规则的  先生们  这是他们工作的一部分
Well, my whole group is irregular, gentlemen. That's part of their job.

677
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,224
我们必须向我们的C.O报告
We'll have to report it to our C.O.

678
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:50,605
我不在乎你做了多少报告  上尉
I don't care how many reports you make, captain,

679
00:44:50,776 --> 00:44:57,111
只要新的坐标是4131-2595  你明白了吗
just as long as the new coordinates are 4131-2795. Have you got that?

680
00:45:02,997 --> 00:45:04,954
嘿  这到底是怎么回事
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

681
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:06,618
我们正在改变方向
We're changing directions.

682
00:45:11,297 --> 00:45:14,251
少校  如果我们不跳到我们计划的地方
Major, if we don't jump where we planned,

683
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,299
我们将如何与抵抗联系起来
how will we link up with the Resistance?

684
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:17,749
你让我担心
You let me worry about that.

685
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:20,254
我在斯科普里有一个地址
I've got an address in Skopje.

686
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,969
你和我会找到它的  Demchuk
You and I will find it, Demchuk.

687
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:29,606
Vasco  他们要迟到了
They are running late, Vasco.

688
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:31,932
他们会来的  我姐姐收到…
They'll be here. My sister received...

689
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:10,016
出了问题  我得回斯科普里了
Something's gone wrong. I have to get back to Skopje.

690
00:46:10,189 --> 00:46:12,347
无论如何我们都得离开这里
We have to get out of here in any case.

691
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,273
无论发生什么事  我都需要一个囚犯来审讯
Whatever happens, I need one prisoner for interrogation.

692
00:46:19,615 --> 00:46:21,109
我们要那六个
We'll take those six.

693
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,530
你们这些人  投降
You men, surrender!

694
00:46:50,563 --> 00:46:53,232
我有你的囚犯审问  上尉
I have your prisoner for interrogation, captain.

695
00:46:53,774 --> 00:46:55,352
让他活着
Keep him alive.

696
00:47:53,626 --> 00:47:54,954
先生  请不要往下看
Don't look down, sir.

697
00:47:55,127 --> 00:47:56,787
看着他们就好像你恨他们一样
Look at them as if you hate them

698
00:47:56,962 --> 00:47:58,872
他们肯定你是南斯拉夫人
and they will be sure you are Yugoslav.

699
00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:28,993
对  阿瑞斯是战争之神
Yes? Ares is the god of war.

700
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:32,743
我们都是他的孩子
And we are all his children.

701
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:34,160
进来
Come in.

702
00:48:37,962 --> 00:48:39,753
站住  拿起他们的枪
Stand still. Take their guns.

703
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:41,297
这到底是什么
Now, what the hell is this?

704
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,026
保持安静  彼得  检查一下弹药
Keep quiet. Peter, check the ammunition.

705
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:46,712
美国陆军  标准问题
U.S. Army, standard issue,

706
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:49,461
45口径弹药  全新的
.45-calibre ammunition, brand-new.

707
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,676
你在找谁  我已经给过你密码了
Who are you looking for? I already gave you the password.

708
00:48:52,852 --> 00:48:56,386
密码可能已经被那些被撕掉舌头的人折磨掉了
The password could have been tortured out of men who then had their tongues torn out.

709
00:48:56,564 --> 00:48:59,019
你在找谁  党派领袖
Who are you looking for? A partisan leader.

710
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:01,861
缩写Y.V.
Initials Y.V.

711
00:49:03,696 --> 00:49:06,021
我是Yelena Vascovic
I am Yelena Vascovic.

712
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,491
没有人知道你只有我的姓名首字母
No one else knew that you had only my initials.

713
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,700
昨晚发生了什么事
What happened last night?

714
00:49:11,871 --> 00:49:15,037
嘿  看  我可以说得好些  没有那个炮指着我的头
Hey, look, I can talk a lot better without that cannon pointing at my head.

715
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,450
对不起  对不起
Please, I'm sorry.

716
00:49:18,627 --> 00:49:20,537
我理解
I understand.

717
00:49:20,713 --> 00:49:23,251
我命令着陆区上空飞行
I ordered an overflight over the landing area.

718
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:26,105
我只是预感到德国人在那里等着我们
I just had a hunch that maybe the Germans were there waiting for us.

719
00:49:26,218 --> 00:49:28,045
没有党派会把你交给德国人
No partisan would give you to the Germans.

720
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,047
嘿  我没那么说
Hey, I didn't say that.

721
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:33,971
好吧  我们接到命令  不管什么原因  我们没有联系
Okay, we had orders that, for whatever reason we didn't make any contact,

722
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:36,219
我们是来这里的  我们到了
we were to come here. So here we are.

723
00:49:36,395 --> 00:49:38,886
那些想见你的人没有回来
The men that were supposed to meet you did not come back.

724
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:41,022
我们整晚都没听到他们说的话
We have heard no word all night from them.

725
00:49:41,192 --> 00:49:43,647
最好假设他们被带走了
It's best to assume they were taken.

726
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:45,563
其中一个是我弟弟
One of them was my brother.

727
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:50,864
如果他们幸运的话  他们就有机会战斗了
If they were lucky, they had a chance to fight.

728
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:54,282
看  我们能给海岸附近的英国潜艇发个口信吗
Look, can we get a message to the British submarine off the coast?

729
00:49:54,455 --> 00:49:56,531
是的  当然  告诉他们我们成功了
Yes, of course. Tell them we made it.

730
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,842
鹰四狮一  鹰四狮一
Eagle Four to Lion One. Eagle Four to Lion One.

731
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,290
你能读懂我吗
Can you read me?

732
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:13,005
是的  这是狮子一号  请往前走
- Yes, this is Lion One. - Go ahead, please.

733
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:18,310
这是老鹰四号  718-9.
This is Eagle Four. 7-187-9.

734
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:18,979
192724
192724.

735
00:50:24,276 --> 00:50:26,233
来访者已经到了
The visitors have arrived.

736
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:29,108
很好  我有一个来自伦敦霸王的信息
Very good. I have a message from Overlord in London.

737
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:31,274
你能马上离开SK Opje吗
Can you get out of Sk opje at once?

738
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,115
他们必须对你决定着陆地点的反应做出反应
They must be reacting to your decision to overfly the landing site.

739
00:50:35,287 --> 00:50:36,782
告诉我出了什么事
Tell me what's wrong.

740
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:39,707
没什么不对的  我们正在路上
Nothing's wrong. We're on our way.

741
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:41,913
肯定的
Affirmative.

742
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:44,956
很好  再见
Very good. Cheerio.

743
00:50:47,299 --> 00:50:51,131
对不起  昨晚你弟弟来接我们
Look, I'm sorry your brother came to meet us last night.

744
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:55,135
我的哥哥  上帝愿意  已经死了
My brother, God willing, is dead.

745
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:13,027
他又失去知觉了
He's lost consciousness again.

746
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,240
是的  我能看到
Yes, I can see that.

747
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:18,365
我让你查明Major Wright要袭击火车
I asked you to find out where Major Wright will attack the train

748
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:21,291
经过数小时的审讯  你没有结果
and after hours of interrogation, you have no results.

749
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:24,139
将军  请原谅我  但最好还是把火车挂起来
Forgive me, general. But would it not be better to hold up the train

750
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,415
还是走另一条路
or take another route?

751
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:28,339
我应该给F解释什么
What explanation am I supposed to give the f黨rer?

752
00:51:28,507 --> 00:51:30,796
我不能把他的部下从叛徒专业中解救出来
That I cannot save his men from a renegade major

753
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:32,759
还有12个普通罪犯
and 12 common criminals?

754
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:47,316
你想去那列火车吗
Where do you want to hit that train?

755
00:51:47,485 --> 00:51:50,688
这是我们穿越空旷国家的计划…
This is the plan We go through open country...

756
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:53,694
我们在附近的火车上相遇
and we meet the train here, near Nish.

757
00:51:53,866 --> 00:51:57,116
在保加利亚边境以北20英里处有一个立交桥
There's an overpass about 20 miles north of the Bulgarian border,

758
00:51:57,286 --> 00:51:58,531
在Pirot附近
near Pirot.

759
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:01,277
火车因等级下降而减慢速度
The train slows down there because of a grade.

760
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:03,117
我训练了我的男人
And I've trained my men

761
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,700
从立交桥上跳上这些移动的汽车
to jump on these moving cars from the overpass

762
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:07,787
把这些纳粹分子赶走
to take out these Nazi hotshots.

763
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:11,213
然后我会向我的人解释  如果他们有什么问题  我会告诉你的
Then I'll explain it to my men. If they have any problems, I'll let you know.

764
00:52:18,474 --> 00:52:20,550
Stern  我能为你做点什么
Well, what can I do for you, Stern?

765
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:22,719
少校  有点糊涂了
The men are a little confused, major.

766
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:24,519
哦  也许有点害怕吧
Oh, a little scared, maybe?

767
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:27,061
嗯  很多事情都没有发生
Well, a lot of things have been happening that don't quite add up.

768
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:29,233
首先  霍夫曼从那架飞机上跳了出来
First, Hoffman jumps out of that plane and bounces.

769
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,685
霍夫曼在一次训练事故中丧生
Hoffman was killed in a training accident.

770
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:34,899
只有你抓住了尸体和溜槽  才把他救出来
Only you grabbed the body and the chute and got him out of there.

771
00:52:35,074 --> 00:52:36,734
是的  那么我们不应该跳到我们应该去的地方
Yeah, then we don't jump where we're supposed to,

772
00:52:36,909 --> 00:52:39,151
我们不进入斯科普里  我们在山上蜿蜒
we don't go into Skopje, we wind up in the hills.

773
00:52:39,328 --> 00:52:42,448
如果你想和德国人一起跳下去在斯科普里散步
If you wanted to jump down with the Germans and walk in Skopje,

774
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,868
你是我的客人  乔
you be my guest, Joe.

775
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,500
怎么回事  少校
What the hell's going on, major?

776
00:52:47,336 --> 00:52:50,954
好的  你有权知道
All right. You're entitled to know.

777
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:53,338
这次肮脏的打电话响了
There's a ringer in the Dirty Dozen this time.

778
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,379
是的  腐烂了
That's right, something rotten.

779
00:52:57,555 --> 00:53:00,758
一个把我们都卖掉的犹大
A Judas who's selling us all out.

780
00:53:03,936 --> 00:53:05,456
难道它不是南斯拉夫人吗
Couldn't it be one of the Yugoslavians?

781
00:53:05,604 --> 00:53:09,472
不  南斯拉夫人没有切开霍夫曼的斜线
No, the Yugoslavs didn't slice Hoffman's chute line.

782
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:13,604
这是我们的一个  离家乡很近
It's one of us, closer to home.

783
00:53:19,994 --> 00:53:21,618
对
Yes?

784
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:24,615
贝尔格莱德  将军
Belgrade, general.

785
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:28,743
李希特将军
General Richter.

786
00:53:30,462 --> 00:53:32,585
给我坐标
Give me the coordinates.

787
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:35,923
立即通知柏林奥伯曼曼多
Notify Oberkommando Berlin immediately.

788
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:39,213
不  没关系  我自己打电话
No, never mind, I will make the call myself.

789
00:53:57,865 --> 00:54:00,154
他们不到一小时前就在这里进攻了
They attacked here less than an hour ago.

790
00:54:00,326 --> 00:54:03,825
但是  先生  我们的信息是  他们将继续使用
But, sir, our information was that they would go on to Nish.

791
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:05,746
这是正确的
That's right.

792
00:54:06,248 --> 00:54:09,664
少校莱特没有降落伞  我们预期他
Major Wright did not parachute in where we expected him.

793
00:54:09,835 --> 00:54:12,326
他没有攻击我们所期望的他
He didn't attack where we expected him.

794
00:54:12,505 --> 00:54:16,585
我怀疑他是否会攻击我们所期望的火车
I doubt very much if he'll attack the train where we expect him.

795
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,927
让飞机15分钟后起飞
Get a plane ready to leave in 15 minutes.

796
00:54:21,514 --> 00:54:23,672
为Sofia提供航班信息
File flight information for Sofia.

797
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:37,351
他死了  长官  是的  我能看见  上尉
He's dead, sir. Yes, I can see that, captain.

798
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:16,351
我以为我们要穿越空旷的国家
I thought we were going through open country.

799
00:55:16,527 --> 00:55:18,603
我猜少校一直在改变主意
The major keeps changing his mind, I guess.

800
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:21,317
你知道我在想什么吗  我不知道
You know what I been thinking? I got no idea.

801
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,399
我以前从未有过中尉
I never had a lieutenant before.

802
00:55:41,844 --> 00:55:44,845
你今天要把尸体带到Pirot埋葬和归还吗
You're taking the body to Pirot for burial and returning today?

803
00:55:45,431 --> 00:55:47,507
是死者的遗愿
Was last wish of deceased.

804
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,852
你的试卷看起来很整齐  等一下
Your papers seem to be in order. Wait a minute.

805
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:57,685
你来自哪个村庄
What village are you from?

806
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,936
库马诺沃  先生  离这儿只有几英里远
Kumanovo, sir. Just few miles from here.

807
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:02,437
我知道那个该死的村庄在哪里
I know where the damn village is.

808
00:56:04,658 --> 00:56:08,608
有多少游击队员藏匿在那里  等待杀害德国士兵
How many partisans are hiding there, waiting to murder German soldiers?

809
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:11,745
没有  长官  我知道
None, sir, that I know of.

810
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:13,493
说谎
Lying.

811
00:56:14,668 --> 00:56:16,460
该死的马其顿人
Damned Macedonians.

812
00:56:18,964 --> 00:56:21,716
在哀悼中  你呢
In mourning, are you?

813
00:56:21,884 --> 00:56:26,131
亲爱的死去的灵魂  是的
For a dear departed soul, yes.

814
00:56:34,396 --> 00:56:37,563
你几乎可以是德国人了
You could almost be German.

815
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:41,312
北欧  嗯  纯的
Nordic, hm? Pure.

816
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:49,109
纯在这个国家的猪
Pure in this country of swine.

817
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:53,742
打开棺材
Open the coffin.

818
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:57,036
我想看看你是否在边境走私任何东西…
I want to see if you're smuggling anything across the border...

819
00:56:57,211 --> 00:56:58,491
除了死者
besides the dead.

820
00:56:58,671 --> 00:57:01,078
长官  神圣服务结束了
Sir, it was closed after holy service.

821
00:57:01,257 --> 00:57:03,664
在这一生中  有…然后我会打开它
In this life, there is... Then I will open it.

822
00:57:03,843 --> 00:57:05,123
是啊
Yeah?

823
00:57:34,874 --> 00:57:37,447
好吧  里面一定有电话
All right, there must be a phone in there.

824
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:20,585
贝尔格莱德正试图回击  他们一定过去了
Belgrade is trying to call back. They must have got through.

825
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:22,911
好的  五分钟后我们就离开这里
All right, we'll be out of here in five minutes.

826
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:24,915
半小时后天就黑了
And it'll be dark in a half-hour.

827
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:28,818
正规军一路  对吗  中士
Regular Army all the way, right, sergeant?

828
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,608
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

829
00:59:30,781 --> 00:59:33,153
看  我得到了穆兹的狗标签
Look, I got Mu馿z's dog tags.

830
00:59:33,325 --> 00:59:35,365
如果有什么事情发生在我身上…
If anything should happen to me...

831
00:59:35,536 --> 00:59:37,410
我希望你能把这些标签拿回来  如果可以的话
I want you to get those tags back, if you can.

832
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,611
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

833
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:40,912
现在  我们应该袭击边境上的火车
Now, we're supposed to attack the train on the border.

834
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:45,994
真正的目标  Sofia以东
The real target? East of Sofia.

835
00:59:54,513 --> 00:59:56,470
所以我在学校的最后一年
So my last year in school,

836
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,508
我要么结婚  要么尝试外国服务
I was either gonna get married or try for the Foreign Service.

837
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:03,184
一定是一个艰难的决定
Must have been a hell of a tough decision.

838
01:00:04,857 --> 01:00:08,641
不要笑  我可能是个很好的妻子…
Don't laugh. I might have been a very good wife...

839
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:11,606
安德鲁是一位相当聪明的外国服务官员
andlor a reasonably bright Foreign Service officer.

840
01:00:12,114 --> 01:00:14,522
可能是  你还不能吗
Might have been? Can't you still be?

841
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:18,695
我认为未来不远  乔
I don't think that far ahead in the future, Joe.

842
01:00:18,871 --> 01:00:20,780
不再了
Not anymore.

843
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:25,661
你呢  没有战后的计划
What about you? No postwar plans?

844
01:00:27,713 --> 01:00:30,382
我在战争中已经很久了
I've been in the war a long time.

845
01:00:30,883 --> 01:00:32,377
没有别的路可走吗
No other way to go?

846
01:00:32,551 --> 01:00:33,962
不
No.

847
01:00:34,136 --> 01:00:36,461
反正我也不知道
I don't know of one, anyway.

848
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:39,509
嗯  这不是完全正确的
Well, that's not altogether true.

849
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:43,681
只是有时候…
It's just that sometimes...

850
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,563
我想给全世界每一个犹太人一个自动武器  并说：
I want to give every Jew in the world an automatic weapon and say:

851
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:52,312
抓住这一点  在这个世纪  你需要它来活下去
"Hold onto this, you're gonna need it just to stay alive in this century."

852
01:00:53,405 --> 01:00:56,572
有时候我想    天哪  肯定有时间……
And other times I think, " My God, there must be some time..."

853
01:00:57,243 --> 01:01:02,533
当我不需要为了活着而杀戮
when I don't have to kill just to stay alive."

854
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:22,092
-早上好  先生们  -早上好
- Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning.

855
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:23,810
上校  最近有什么事
What's the latest, colonel?

856
01:01:23,978 --> 01:01:26,136
我们有一份来自贝尔格莱德的地下报告
We have an underground report from Belgrade.

857
01:01:26,313 --> 01:01:28,721
昨晚火车上没有发生任何袭击
There was no attack on the train last night

858
01:01:28,899 --> 01:01:31,355
一小时前  他们跨进了保加利亚
and they crossed into Bulgaria roughly an hour ago.

859
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:34,047
亚得里亚海的英国潜艇部队呢
What about the English Submarine Force out here in the Adriatic?

860
01:01:34,113 --> 01:01:36,568
自从上一次斯科普里通讯以来  没有任何消息
No word since the last communication from Skopje.

861
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,066
假设德国人占领了公寓
The assumption is the Germans have seized the apartment

862
01:01:39,243 --> 01:01:41,236
摧毁了通信设备
and destroyed the communications equipment.

863
01:01:41,412 --> 01:01:46,952
嗯  也许他只是害怕使用它  直到他发现谁站在他一边
Well, maybe he's just afraid to use it until he finds out who's on his side.

864
01:01:47,126 --> 01:01:51,788
将军  火车是从土耳其边境出发的半天路程
General, that train is one half day's journey from the Turkish border.

865
01:01:51,964 --> 01:01:53,506
穿越边境的那一刻
The moment it crosses the border

866
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:56,295
对它的任何攻击都是对土耳其的战争行为
any attack upon it is an act of war on Turkey.

867
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,919
你到底想从我这里得到什么  克拉克
What the hell do you want from me, Clark?

868
01:01:59,096 --> 01:02:00,425
我相信莱特会进攻的
I'm sure Wright will attack

869
01:02:00,598 --> 01:02:02,756
当他看到有机会成功的时候
when he sees there's some chance to succeed.

870
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:05,260
将军  我已经自由了
General, I've taken the liberty

871
01:02:05,436 --> 01:02:08,141
警告亚历山大市的第十二战斗机司令部
of alerting the 12th Fighter Command at Alexandria.

872
01:02:08,314 --> 01:02:10,390
但我想我们排除了飞机
But I thought we ruled out planes

873
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:12,144
因为我们不能确定
because we couldn't be sure

874
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,651
从空中撞到一辆车厢里的12个人
of hitting 12 men in one railroad car from the air.

875
01:02:17,907 --> 01:02:19,698
你有估计吗
You have an estimate?

876
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:22,654
他们可以在今天的1200个小时里抢火车
They could scramble and attack the train at 1200 hours today

877
01:02:22,828 --> 01:02:24,572
当它还在保加利亚的时候
whilst it's still in Bulgaria,

878
01:02:24,747 --> 01:02:26,989
有很好的成功机会
with a very good chance of complete success.

879
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,993
如果第十二战斗机群攻击
And if the 12th Fighter group attacks

880
01:02:29,168 --> 01:02:31,457
同时  少校和他的人民也一样
the same time that the major and his people do,

881
01:02:31,629 --> 01:02:35,377
我们不必担心德国人杀死所有肮脏的人
we won't have to worry about the Germans killing off all the Dirty Dozen.

882
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:38,254
我们会自己炸掉的
We'll blow them up ourselves.

883
01:02:39,136 --> 01:02:44,890
如果这种情况发生  那就是战争  这是无济于事的
If that happens, it's war and it can't be helped.

884
01:02:46,936 --> 01:02:50,352
你知道  克拉克  你是个很好的军官…
You know, Clark, you're a hell of a good officer...

885
01:02:51,232 --> 01:02:53,308
但你是个私生子
but you are a bastard.

886
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:58,984
现在  他们能从亚历山大市进入的最后时刻是什么
Now, what's the last moment they can go in from Alexandria?

887
01:02:59,365 --> 01:03:02,650
0900小时  先生  我们等一下
0900 hours, sir. We'll wait.

888
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:06,662
将军  现在有任何延误…我说  我们等一下
General, any delay now... I said, we'll wait.

889
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,749
在0900小时  如果我们没有收到他的信…
At 0900 hours, if we haven't heard from him...

890
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,999
莱特少校和他的指挥官将被视为行动失败
Major Wright and his command will be considered lost in action.

891
01:03:18,384 --> 01:03:21,385
我们将采取另一种解决方案
And we'll go to an alternative solution.

892
01:03:25,057 --> 01:03:29,007
霍尔特中士对你再次改变计划感到惊讶
Sergeant Holt seemed surprised that you changed the plans again.

893
01:03:29,186 --> 01:03:33,729
是的  有些不同于男人的期望  对吧
Yes, something different from what the men expected, right?

894
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:36,022
从你第一次来到我的公寓
From the first moment you came to my apartment,

895
01:03:36,193 --> 01:03:38,565
我知道出了什么事
I knew that something was wrong.

896
01:03:38,737 --> 01:03:41,110
我的人也要死了
My men are dying too.

897
01:03:41,282 --> 01:03:43,570
你不是时候告诉我更多了吗
Isn't it time that you tell me more?

898
01:03:43,742 --> 01:03:48,570
我该告诉你我给我的人的所有信息了
It's time I told you that all the information I give to my men

899
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:50,574
被传给德国人
is transmitted right to the Germans,

900
01:03:50,749 --> 01:03:53,287
可能是由一个大功率微型发射器
probably by a high-powered mini-transmitter.

901
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,034
那么  你必须找到叛徒然后杀了他
Well, then you have to find the traitor and kill him.

902
01:03:56,213 --> 01:03:58,253
不  我必须非常小心
No, I gotta be very careful.

903
01:03:58,424 --> 01:04:03,584
如果我现在太多地动摇这些人  他们可能会盲目地互相攻击
If I shake up the men too much now, they could turn on each other blindly.

904
01:04:03,762 --> 01:04:06,598
不  他会走错路  我会把他钉死的
No, he'll make a wrong move and I'll nail him.

905
01:04:12,938 --> 01:04:14,267
上帝帮助我们
God help us.

906
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:31,781
你的论文
Your papers?

907
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:28,969
你以前从没见过桥  是吧
You've never seen a bridge before, huh?

908
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,923
哦  对不起  先生  他几乎从不离开农场
Oh, sorry, sir. He almost never leaves the farm.

909
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:37,438
你有证件吗  笨蛋
You have any papers, dummy?

910
01:06:05,426 --> 01:06:06,706
他给你带来不好的时间
He was giving you a bad time?

911
01:06:06,886 --> 01:06:08,925
好吧  你可以这么说
Well, you could say that.

912
01:06:18,314 --> 01:06:19,808
移动它
Move it!

913
01:07:18,082 --> 01:07:19,624
早上好  先生们
Good morning, gentlemen.

914
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,413
正如你所知  我们在土耳其边境的几个小时之内
As you know, we are within a few hours of the Turkish border

915
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:26,204
在我们尊敬的轴心国  保加利亚
and within the confines of our esteemed Axis ally, Bulgaria.

916
01:07:26,382 --> 01:07:28,920
将军  你愿意和我们一起去旅行吗
Will you be joining us for the rest of the trip, general?

917
01:07:29,093 --> 01:07:31,335
我很遗憾我还有最后一个任务要处理
I regret I have one last mission to attend to.

918
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:34,217
但是今晚我会在伊斯坦布尔见到你们
But I shall see you all in Istanbul tonight.

919
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:37,759
让我给你留下继续安全的需要
Let me impress upon you the need for continued security.

920
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:39,346
但我向你保证
But I assure you,

921
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,513
f r r的命令将得到满足
the f黨rer's commands will be fulfilled.

922
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:44,440
说到F·R的命令  李希特将军
Speaking of the f黨rer's commands, General Richter,

923
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:48,273
我这儿有一封在慕尼黑寄来的信
I have here a letter delivered to me in Munich,

924
01:07:48,445 --> 01:07:52,028
阿道夫·希特勒三天前在柏林签下的
signed by Adolf Hitler in Berlin three days ago.

925
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,192
我之前没有提到过的原因
The reason I have not mentioned it before

926
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:57,155
是因为我觉得我们仍然处于严重的危险之中
is because I felt we were still in grave danger.

927
01:07:57,329 --> 01:07:59,820
安全是必不可少的
Security is essential.

928
01:08:00,624 --> 01:08:02,000
先生们
Gentlemen,

929
01:08:02,168 --> 01:08:05,122
千年帝国在我们手中……
the Thousand-Year Reich is in our hands...

930
01:08:05,629 --> 01:08:07,752
在火车车厢2420
in train car 2420.

931
01:08:15,097 --> 01:08:17,422
我向所有参与的人表达我衷心的祝愿
"I send my heartfelt good wishes to all those involved"

932
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,269
在这个伟大而需要的企业中
in this great and needed enterprise.

933
01:08:20,436 --> 01:08:23,603
我向那些传播大德种子的人致敬
I salute those who will spread the seeds of greater Germany

934
01:08:23,772 --> 01:08:26,180
遍及全世界
throughout the world.

935
01:08:26,358 --> 01:08:28,398
无论发生在我身上
Whatever happens to me,

936
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:32,317
我们最后的胜利仍然是不可避免的
our final victory remains inevitable.

937
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:35,397
因此  我现在指定为我的继任者
Accordingly, I now designate as my successor

938
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:38,530
作为第四帝国的领袖…
and as the leader of the Fourth Reich...

939
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,535
德国空军少将
Major General of the Waffen S. S...

940
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:45,707
卡尔·李希特
"Karl Richter."

941
01:08:46,504 --> 01:08:47,998
签署
Signed...

942
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:50,414
阿道夫·希特勒
Adolf Hitler.

943
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:25,096
到底发生了什么事
What the hell is going on?

944
01:12:19,175 --> 01:12:21,333
彼得
Peter!

945
01:12:57,463 --> 01:12:59,171
警官  我们来了
We're coming through, sergeant.

946
01:13:07,097 --> 01:13:09,505
我们遇到了敌人  长官
We have met the enemy, sir.

947
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,559
他们走了
They are gone.

948
01:13:11,727 --> 01:13:13,352
干得好
Good job.

949
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:14,766
该死的好工作
Damn good job.

950
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:17,346
好吧  让我们看看我们得到了什么
All right, let's see what we got.

951
01:13:28,786 --> 01:13:30,613
那里肯定有十来个
Must be almost a full dozen of them there.

952
01:13:30,788 --> 01:13:32,282
你怎么认为
What do you think?

953
01:13:32,456 --> 01:13:34,781
你知道任务
You know the mission.

954
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:38,450
别开枪  我们投降
Don't shoot! We surrender.

955
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:42,415
抓住它  我们在俘虏
Hold it. We're taking prisoners.

956
01:13:43,592 --> 01:13:45,300
我们可能以后需要它们
We may need them later.

957
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:47,592
是那些杂种开始了这一切
Those are the bastards who started all this.

958
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:55,141
这是命令  Stern
That's an order, Stern.

959
01:14:08,242 --> 01:14:09,653
扔掉你的武器
Throw out your weapons.

960
01:14:31,015 --> 01:14:32,260
你能行  少校
You can do it, major.

961
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:34,177
别让我们失望
Don't let us down.

962
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:49,904
大多数炙手可热的纳粹分子都在那里  Dravko
Most of the hotshot high-ranking Nazis are back there, Dravko.

963
01:14:50,075 --> 01:14:51,618
可能是我们回家的机票
Could be our ticket home.

964
01:14:51,785 --> 01:14:54,905
我不明白  我们可以去哪里
I don't understand. Where can we go?

965
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,868
坎贝尔中尉和我  我们在地图上发现了一条支线
Lieutenant Campbell and I, we found a spur line on the map

966
01:14:58,042 --> 01:15:01,375
就到爱琴海  穿过希腊的尖端
right down to the Aegean. Cutting through the tip of Greece.

967
01:15:01,545 --> 01:15:04,119
Yelena将联系英国在该地区的子公司
Yelena will contact the British sub in the area.

968
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:09,174
谁知道呢  前面一百英里  我们可能赶上
Who knows? A hundred miles ahead, and we might make it.

969
01:16:10,531 --> 01:16:12,607
嘿  Demchuk
Hey, Demchuk.

970
01:16:13,284 --> 01:16:15,739
少校在哪里  他正在检查那辆车
Where's the major? He's checking out that car.

971
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:19,578
我最好掩护他
I better cover him.

972
01:16:49,236 --> 01:16:51,727
决定去另一边好吗  达哥斯蒂诺
Decide to go to the other side for good, D'Agostino?

973
01:17:01,457 --> 01:17:04,992
我能说什么  少校  你是怎么猜到的
What can I say, major? How did you guess?

974
01:17:05,169 --> 01:17:07,327
无话可说  无事可做
Nothing to say and nothing to do.

975
01:17:07,505 --> 01:17:09,165
但我很好奇
But I'm curious.

976
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,665
当Wilson决定逃跑时
When Wilson decided to escape

977
01:17:11,842 --> 01:17:13,835
你假装站在他旁边  为什么
you pretended to side with him. Why?

978
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:20,634
他在谈论爱尔兰
He was talking about Ireland.

979
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,265
我已经和德国领事馆谈过了
I was already talking to the German consulate there.

980
01:17:23,437 --> 01:17:26,011
所以你会杀了他们三个  把他们的头给我
So you would've killed the three of them, brought me their heads.

981
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:27,814
如果必须的话
If it got to be necessary.

982
01:17:27,983 --> 01:17:30,190
我不得不交付整个团队
I had to deliver the whole group.

983
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:33,030
只有Collins救了我的麻烦
Only Collins saved me the trouble.

984
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:48,545
所以你害怕从飞机上跳出来的戏剧性事件
So the high drama about you being afraid to jump out of the airplane,

985
01:17:48,712 --> 01:17:52,378
只是为了掩盖你切开霍夫曼的斜道的事实  对吧
it was just to cover up the fact that you sliced Hoffman's chute, right?

986
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:57,888
少校  我从小在一个15层楼的窗子里长大
Major, I grew up hanging out the window of a 15-floor tenement.

987
01:17:58,055 --> 01:18:01,506
别告诉我你是土生土长的法西斯主义者  卡迈恩
Now, don't tell me you're a native-born fascist, Carmine.

988
01:18:01,684 --> 01:18:03,178
你这么做是为了钱  对吧
You did it for the money, right?

989
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:04,846
嗨  少校
Hey, major.

990
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,265
钱
Money.

991
01:18:06,438 --> 01:18:09,190
很多钱
Lots of money.

992
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:12,193
这就是世界运转的原因
That's what makes the world go round.

993
01:18:17,116 --> 01:18:19,239
见鬼去吧
See you in hell.

994
01:18:36,177 --> 01:18:38,253
见鬼去吧
See you in hell.

995
01:18:38,971 --> 01:18:40,631
正确的
Right.

996
01:18:52,776 --> 01:18:54,603
-来吧  把你的背放进去
- Come on. - Get your back into it!

997
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:57,437
移动它
Move it!

998
01:18:57,615 --> 01:18:59,406
加油
Come on!

999
01:18:59,575 --> 01:19:01,817
这是正确的
That's right.

1000
01:19:01,994 --> 01:19:04,152
住手  坚持住  把它举起来
Stop! Hold on, hold it up.

1001
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:06,785
举起手来
Hold it up!

1002
01:19:06,957 --> 01:19:09,744
把它拿回来  我们可能需要那一罐汽油
Bring it back. We might need that tankful of gas.

1003
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:11,627
你是说  把它放在我们面前
You mean, leave it in front of us?

1004
01:19:11,795 --> 01:19:15,627
把它连接起来  我们会把它一路推到希腊
Couple it on and we'll push it all the way to Greece.

1005
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,174
好的  好吧
All right. All right!

1006
01:19:18,344 --> 01:19:21,629
走吧  来吧  移动它
Let's go! Come on, move it!

1007
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:41,867
当火车向南行驶时  立即开始飞越
Begin immediate overflights of the train as it moves south.

1008
01:19:42,034 --> 01:19:44,594
但他们肯定不能乘火车到土耳其边境  长官
But surely they cannot take the train to the Turkish border, sir.

1009
01:19:44,662 --> 01:19:46,286
我们先去找火车  上尉
Let's find the train first, captain.

1010
01:19:46,455 --> 01:19:48,495
然后我们将确切地确定它的去向
Then we shall decide exactly where it's going.

1011
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:51,501
请确保此刻飞机上没有一架飞机着火
Make sure that none of the planes fire on the train at this moment.

1012
01:19:51,669 --> 01:19:52,914
但是他们还能阻止他们吗
But how else can they stop them?

1013
01:19:54,046 --> 01:19:56,003
我会阻止他们的
I'll stop them.

1014
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:58,498
我们不知道我们有多少人还活着
We don't know how many of our people are still alive.

1015
01:19:58,676 --> 01:20:02,009
作为人质  他们对这个少校莱特有巨大的价值
They have tremendous value to this Major Wright, as hostages.

1016
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:03,971
他会意识到这一点的
He will be aware of that.

1017
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,886
鹰四狮一  请进来
Eagle Four to Lion One. Come in, please.

1018
01:20:56,108 --> 01:20:59,560
鹰四狮一  请进来
Eagle Four to Lion One. Come in, please.

1019
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:05,067
我们可能离得太远了  我不知道他们能否再接我们
We may be too far away. I don't know if they can pick us up anymore.

1020
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:08,157
鹰四狮一  请进来
Eagle Four to Lion One. Come in, please.

1021
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:10,654
狮子一号到鹰四号  -你在吗
- Lion One to Eagle Four. - Are you there?

1022
01:21:10,831 --> 01:21:14,746
是的  我们在这里  718-9.
Yes, we are here. 7-187-9.

1023
01:21:14,919 --> 01:21:18,868
192724
192724.

1024
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:21,087
首先给他们这些坐标
Give them these coordinates first.

1025
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,594
告诉他们我想在1030的第二组坐标上集合
Tell them I want a rendezvous on the second set of coordinates at 1030.

1026
01:21:25,763 --> 01:21:32,097
我们正在南部通过4123-2179
We are proceeding south passing at 4123-2179.

1027
01:21:32,269 --> 01:21:36,563
你能安排在4128到2185与我们会合吗
Can you arrange a rendezvous with us at 4128-2185?

1028
01:21:36,732 --> 01:21:40,397
这会让我们做些什么  但是我们会试着在那里找到一个潜艇
It will tak e some doing, but we'll try to have one of our subs there.

1029
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,277
你的ETA是多少
What is your ETA?

1030
01:21:43,447 --> 01:21:44,906
1030小时
1030 hours.

1031
01:21:45,074 --> 01:21:46,948
很好  再见
Very good. Cheerio.

1032
01:21:47,117 --> 01:21:48,861
干得好  Yelena
Good job, Yelena.

1033
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:52,076
你知道  如果运气好的话  下星期我可以在伦敦给你买一杯饮料
You know, with any luck, I'll be able to buy you a drink in London next week.

1034
01:21:52,164 --> 01:21:54,536
在伦敦喝一杯真是太好了
It would be nice to have a drink in London.

1035
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:56,831
自从蜜月以来我就没去过那儿
I haven't been there since my honeymoon.

1036
01:21:57,002 --> 01:21:59,920
好像是一千年前的事了  那是多久以前的事了
Seems like a thousand years ago. How long ago was it?

1037
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:02,128
七年  你丈夫呢
Seven years. And your husband?

1038
01:22:02,758 --> 01:22:05,712
在战争的第一周被德国人杀害
Killed by the Germans in the first week of the war.

1039
01:22:06,762 --> 01:22:08,671
那么  你家里其他人呢
Well, how about the rest of your family?

1040
01:22:08,848 --> 01:22:10,390
他们中的一些人死了
Some of them are dead.

1041
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:13,559
有些我不知道他们是死是活
Some I don't know if they're living or dead.

1042
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:16,018
我哥哥  嗯…
My brother, well...

1043
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:19,308
你知道我弟弟一定发生了什么事
You know what must have happened to my brother.

1044
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:25,148
是的  我知道
Yes, I know.

1045
01:22:26,782 --> 01:22:28,775
好吧  你为什么不跟我们一起去呢
Well, look, why don't you come with us.

1046
01:22:28,951 --> 01:22:32,154
我的意思是  他们在伦敦流放了一个南斯拉夫政府
I mean, they got a Yugoslav government-in-exile in London.

1047
01:22:32,329 --> 01:22:34,322
你知道  他们会让你工作的
You know, they'll put you to work.

1048
01:22:34,498 --> 01:22:36,372
然后你可以在战后回来这里
And then you can come back here after the war.

1049
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:41,494
当你这么说的时候  少校  我相信你最好相信它
When you say it, major, I believe lt. You better believe it.

1050
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:52,840
嘿  少校  这些家伙大部分的英语说得比我好
Hey, major, most of these guys speak better English than I do.

1051
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:56,765
是啊  别担心  看看他们发生了什么事
Yeah? Don't worry. Look what happened to them.

1052
01:23:07,907 --> 01:23:10,279
埃切瓦里  少校
Echevarria? Major.

1053
01:23:11,994 --> 01:23:13,785
你怎么样了  乔
