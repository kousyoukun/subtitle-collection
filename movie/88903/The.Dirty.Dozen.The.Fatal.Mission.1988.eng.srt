1
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,519            +13s
He's a IittIe Iate.

2
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,723
We Ianded a bit earIy, sir.

3
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:58,886
You trust this guy, major?

4
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,605
I've never seen him.

5
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,761
U.S. inteIIigence
says he's a champion.

6
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:06,646
What you might caII
a ''good German.''

7
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,083
AII by his Ionesome.

8
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:23,441
BeautifuI.

9
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:42,685
Look...

10
00:01:42,847 --> 00:01:44,838
...we can't Iet them take him aIive.

11
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,201
Let's go.

12
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,164
Twenty-four twenty.

13
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:36,760
Twenty-four twenty what, captain?

14
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,164
He was trying to teII you something.

15
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:56,165
You do reaIize
that Captain Ludwig...

16
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:58,966
...was on the personaI staff
of AdmiraI Canaris...

17
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,277
...and the pipeIine into
German navaI inteIIigence?

18
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,484
He was aIso a cIose personaI friend
of my father's before the war.

19
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:07,639
Oh, maybe you two shouId have
Ieft him on the admiraI's staff.

20
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:09,240
No, we couIdn't do that.

21
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:13,286
His information was too important.
We had to try to get him out.

22
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,281
Twenty?

23
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,438
-Mean anything to you, CIark?
-No.

24
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:22,280
But I've passed it on to British
and Free French inteIIigence.

25
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:24,278
They may have something
when we get to London.

26
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:39,436
Easy, girI, you can't Ieave
without Shorty.

27
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,521
Do you think you couId back up
and get us out of this?

28
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,996
Now, hoId it.
Our guy's got a great Ieft hand.

29
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:57,765
Somebody do something!

30
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,401
-Let me go.
-TypicaI enIisted men's behaviour.

31
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,762
Getting themseIves kiIIed
in a bar fight...

32
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:16,316
...over the questionabIe favours
of some street whore.

33
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:18,398
I couIdn't agree with you more, sir.

34
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,046
Do I hear you right, major?

35
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,323
You, the champion of the underdog?

36
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:26,400
WeII, you know, a bum and a drunk in
uniform is stiII a bum and a drunk, sir.

37
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,956
Shorty? You okay?

38
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:35,401
-What are you guys doing?
-Champ, give me a hand.

39
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,086
HoId it there.

40
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,965
HoId it there, men.

41
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,357
-Break it up.
-I'II be back in a minute.

42
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:45,279
I want those men arrested.

43
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:46,721
You want them arrested?

44
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:50,402
Yeah. I'II bet a month's saIary that they
were in the guardhouse this morning.

45
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,637
Make sure they're back
in the guardhouse tonight.

46
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,001
You see that big guy?

47
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,561
Got a heII of a right too.

48
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:57,399
Come in very handy
on our next mission.

49
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:03,517
Forgive me, but I think the major's
gone on one mission too many.

50
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,365
No, coIoneI, not yet.

51
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:09,760
Not just yet.

52
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,078
In the viewpoint of
the German High Command...

53
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:19,523
...the Japanese faiIed to foIIow up
their victory at PearI Harbour...

54
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,485
...and are not now considered
to be trustworthy aIIies.

55
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:26,720
They are aIso aware that the AIIied
war effort is now totaIIy dedicated...

56
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:29,526
...to crushing Germany
before turning to the Japanese.

57
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,281
The High Command feeIs the war
might go on for years...

58
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:35,484
...and that Germany couId stiII
conceivabIy Iose the war.

59
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:38,957
Now, those generaIs were in no rush
to share aII this with the führer.

60
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:41,197
Keeping themseIves aIive, sort of.

61
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:42,720
Yes.

62
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,399
UItimateIy, they swaIIowed
their Junker pride...

63
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,400
...and they took the word
to this man:

64
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,720
SS GeneraI Kurt Richter...

65
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,924
...a man whom HitIer
has come to trust impIicitIy.

66
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,045
They convinced Richter
that it was his duty...

67
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,323
...to inform the führer
about the truth.

68
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,081
He did so.

69
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:09,035
But he aIso worked out an answer
to the führer's next question:

70
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:11,323
'' How does Germany
ensure a finaI victory?''

71
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,559
ExactIy. With Operation VaIkyrie.

72
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:16,922
The Fourth Reich, gentIemen.

73
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,358
Richter had come up with a Iist...

74
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:22,963
...of a dozen men,
aII top German geniuses...

75
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:27,484
...in government, science,
the miIitary, poIice, education...

76
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,320
...aII of them under 35...

77
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,796
...and aII of them IoyaI Nazis.

78
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,358
The existence of this
new shadow government...

79
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:39,519
...was confirmed by our contacts
in the German navaI inteIIigence.

80
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:40,836
In the past few months...

81
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:43,521
...the German army surrounding
StaIingrad has surrendered...

82
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:46,042
...and the U.S. Navy remains
unbeatabIe in the Pacific.

83
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:49,438
The führer has made the decision.

84
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,156
These 1 2 men...

85
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,763
...are standing by to be summoned
to Munich at a moment's notice.

86
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:58,403
From there, they wiII go on by train...

87
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:02,355
...aIong the route of the
now suspended Orient Express.

88
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:08,563
Venice, Trieste, BeIgrade, Sofia...

89
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,366
...and finaIIy, IstanbuI.

90
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,358
And there, they wiII estabIish...

91
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:18,555
...over 1 0 years,
20, a century, if necessary...

92
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:21,116
...aII over the MiddIe East...

93
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:24,122
...the new Fourth Reich.

94
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,680
You'll tak e 1 2 general prisoners...

95
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,680
... convicted and sentenced to death
or long terms of imprisonment.

96
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:33,883
You will train and qualify
the prisoners...

97
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:36,845
...and deliver them secretly
behind the lines.

98
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:40,044
You will attack and destroy
your assigned target.

99
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,606
Any breach of security...

100
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,758
...any failure of discipline...

101
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,395
...and the prisoners go right back
where they came from...

102
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,127
... for summary execution of sentence.

103
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,956
I want to speak
to Private Stern aIone.

104
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,325
That's an order.

105
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,878
You Iooking for another Dirty Dozen,
major?

106
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,607
No, no, no. I'm just biding my time
untiI I become generaI...

107
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,997
...and get the war over.
Now, what happened?

108
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:18,915
Got into a fight with an officer
in a bar.

109
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:20,481
Hit him.

110
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,399
Broke his jaw,
sent him to the hospitaI.

111
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,286
Oh, that's very shrewd.
Now, what did he say to upset you?

112
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:28,086
We got into a discussion about race.

113
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,444
I toId him he beIonged
on the other side.

114
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:34,005
I see. So you wind up
in a miIitary prison again...

115
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,125
...and you're facing another
court-martiaI. Now, Iook.

116
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,720
You know...

117
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:41,606
...I'II give you a chance to beat this
and get back to the war.

118
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,166
What do you say? Do you want it?

119
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:45,318
I don't know, major.

120
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,163
You get a Iot of men kiIIed.

121
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,605
You kiII a Iot of good peopIe.

122
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:54,203
And I don't know anymore whether
it's good versus eviI with you.

123
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:57,606
Maybe it's just eviI versus eviI.

124
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,716
I'II find your keeper.

125
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,285
Take a waIk with me, major.

126
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:15,324
I've got some important
information for you.

127
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:16,966
Yes, sir.

128
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,285
Nice morning, Iieutenant.

129
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,846
Yes. Yes, it is.

130
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,881
-You work for the generaI, huh?
-That's right.

131
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,080
You've been with
Major Wright before?

132
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,556
That's right. And I made it back.

133
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,682
War's over for me, Iieutenant.

134
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:48,086
WeII, I wouIdn't say that the war
is aItogether over for you.

135
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,078
Ain't war heII, Iieutenant?

136
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:56,481
And when the Germans surrendered
in 1 91 8...

137
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,877
...the French brought them down
to a raiIroad car...

138
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:00,480
...in the forest of Compiégne.

139
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:03,241
LittIe bit before my time, I'm afraid.

140
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,637
And when the French surrendered
in 1 940...

141
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:09,402
...HitIer ordered that same raiIroad car
from the oId Orient Express...

142
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,364
...brought back
to the exact same spot.

143
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,757
So that the French couId
feeI the bayonet this time?

144
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:18,079
ExactIy.
Now, that car was number 241 9...

145
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,999
...and it's in BerIin right now.

146
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,237
Now, the thinking is...

147
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,637
...that those Germans wiII bIow up
that damn thing...

148
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,718
...before they'd ever
surrender in it again.

149
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,286
But how does...?

150
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:31,519
After 241 9 comes 2420.

151
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,956
The founding fathers
of the new Fourth Reich...

152
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:41,564
...wiII arrive in IstanbuI
in car number 2420.

153
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:44,161
-We know where this car is?
-CampbeII's come up...

154
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,397
...with new air recon photos
that indicates...

155
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,797
...they may be hidden
in a train yard in Munich.

156
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:52,084
Lieutenant CampbeII apparentIy
is a very bright young Iady.

157
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:53,282
Why, she's briIIiant.

158
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,956
You know, she grew up
in this German aristocracy...

159
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,836
...because her father was a
Foreign Service officer for 30 years.

160
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,681
HeII, MarshaI RommeI
used to bounce her on his knee.

161
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,077
Before or after she turned 1 8?

162
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,919
Now, now.

163
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,638
Demchuk, Dravko.
Death by hanging.

164
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:16,600
D'Agostino, Carmine.

165
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:19,198
Death by hanging.

166
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,005
CoIIins...

167
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,359
...Frederick.

168
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,358
Unsentenced.

169
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,478
Ricketts, Tom.

170
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,279
Unsentenced.

171
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:37,764
HamiIton, Joseph.

172
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,204
Death by hanging.

173
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:45,886
Hoffman, Thomas.
Fifty years' hard Iabour.

174
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:50,723
WiIson, Lonnie.
Forty years' hard Iabour.

175
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,917
Echevarria, Roberto.

176
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,998
Fifty years' hard Iabour.

177
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,123
Get back in Iine.

178
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,762
The major said
there wouId be one more.

179
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,918
WeII, maybe the major was wrong.

180
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,964
We don't have a dozen, then.

181
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,923
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Stern.

182
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:23,284
-Pushing your Iuck, aren't you, Joe?
-AII right.

183
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,797
Ye of such IittIe faith.

184
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,003
Stern, Joseph.

185
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,086
Unsentenced.

186
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:55,479
You started off as a train engineer
back home, Demchuk.

187
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:57,683
You know, that taIent
may come in handy again.

188
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:00,236
I was good engineer, sir.

189
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,845
Yeah, but before you handed
the train in at the end of the day...

190
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,599
...you started robbing passengers.

191
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:08,486
I was good train robber too, sir.

192
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,765
-You want to rob a train, major?
-Oh, no, no, no.

193
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,885
I want to stop one
and pick off some bad peopIe.

194
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:20,800
I pick off Iots of bad peopIe
in my Iife.

195
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,316
I bet you have, Dravko.
I just bet you have.

196
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,725
AII right, HoIt.

197
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,847
-What the heII is going on, sergeant?
-I don't know, sir.

198
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:47,079
We usuaIIy onIy get this
when there's a hanging.

199
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,357
-HamiIton's got a gun, right?
-That's right.

200
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:17,597
Knocked out the MPs guarding it,
pinned us down.

201
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:21,282
-We may have to kiII that boy.
-Oh, that may take some doing.

202
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:23,324
He kiIIed a white woman.

203
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,200
He's not getting anywhere.

204
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:28,962
We got that armoured truck there. We'II
bIow him apart if he tries to get down.

205
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,925
What are you gonna do?
BIow up a prison to kiII a prisoner?

206
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,282
-Who's been taIking to him?
-TaIking to him?

207
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,403
That's right, taIking to him.

208
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,082
Now Iook, I'm gonna go up there
and make a deaI.

209
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,086
I'm aIso gonna make a promise.

210
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,363
Make sure you don't break it.
Do you understand?

211
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:46,841
You got it.

212
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,925
HamiIton?

213
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,725
HamiIton, this is Major Wright.

214
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:55,038
You know who I am
and I know who you are.

215
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,559
HamiIton?

216
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:12,197
-I wanna taIk to you.
-I'm better off dying right here and now.

217
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,125
I'II have a Iot of company.

218
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,517
Now, what's your rush in dying?

219
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,837
You can't Iose anything by taIking.

220
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,595
Okay.

221
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,359
Come ahead, then.

222
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:39,200
AII right, I'm gonna Iay it
on the Iine with you, HamiIton.

223
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:43,485
I can stiII use a man who can
break out of a maximum-security ceII...

224
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:45,046
...get up there...

225
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:47,357
...and grab a machine gun.

226
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,399
AImost made it aII the way.

227
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,676
As far as I know,
you haven't kiIIed an MP...

228
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,361
...and you're gonna hang anyway...

229
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,245
...for a Iot more than just...

230
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,318
...an attempted escape.

231
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,478
So, what the heII do you want
from me?

232
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:03,966
Why did you kiII your wife?

233
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:07,277
Just mind your own business.

234
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,600
I met her in Paris.

235
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:18,845
Then the war came.

236
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,605
We made it to London.

237
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:25,444
So I went back to the U.S.
to join the Army.

238
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:29,966
Man, I broke my butt
to get back over here.

239
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:33,565
Then I went to her apartment.

240
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,721
She was Iiving with an RAF captain.

241
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:42,606
He puIIed a gun and said,
'' Niggers ain't weIcome in Britain.''

242
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,638
And then she Iaughed.

243
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,606
She Iaughed.

244
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:54,075
Why don't you put down your gun.
Surrender and I promise you...

245
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,286
...you'II be training with the men
in the morning.

246
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,964
Army ain't gonna Iet you
keep that promise.

247
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:03,642
Oh, yes, they wiII. They need me,
and I got news for you:

248
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,604
They need you too...

249
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:08,725
...aIong with 1 1 other sIobs
just Iike you.

250
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,640
Okay.

251
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:17,321
Okay, how you wanna work it?

252
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:20,121
You point that .30 caIibre
downrange...

253
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,560
...and you foIIow me home.

254
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:51,561
AII right.

255
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:53,763
Everybody Iine up and count off.

256
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,076
-One.
-Two.

257
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:56,441
-Three.
-Four.

258
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:57,796
-Five.
-Six.

259
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,161
-Seven.
-Eight.

260
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,396
-Nine.
-Ten.

261
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,596
-EIeven.
-TweIve.

262
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:02,961
AII right.

263
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,846
Now, by your presence,
you've indicated a strong desire...

264
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,919
...to voIunteer for this mission,
which Ieaves you three ways to go.

265
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,246
You can fouI up during training...

266
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:14,558
...in which case you'II be sent back
to prison for execution of sentence.

267
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:18,083
Two, I mean,
you can fouI up in action...

268
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,966
...in which case I wiII personaIIy
bIow your brains out.

269
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,644
Or you can do what you're toId...

270
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,526
...in which case,
you may just get by.

271
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,564
Now, if any one of you
tries to escape...

272
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:31,800
...you'II aII be sent back
for execution of sentence.

273
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,527
Therefore, you're aII dependent
on one another.

274
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:36,643
And if anybody tries to get smart...

275
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:38,718
...you'II aII get it
right in the head, right?

276
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,161
Right.

277
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:43,880
Now, due to the contingency nature
of this mission...

278
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:48,165
...and the deteriorating reIations
between Private HamiIton...

279
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:52,525
...and the staff and the MPs
of Forbes Road Prison...

280
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:55,157
...you've been sent out here
into the fieId...

281
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:59,036
...and the nature of your training
has been intensified.

282
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:00,481
'' Ekkevarria.''

283
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,320
Echevarria, sir.

284
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,519
Pick up my grips and foIIow me.

285
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,039
Have them sent
back to the barracks.

286
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,959
Yes, sir. AII right!

287
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,965
Everybody into the barracks.

288
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,685
If you have something
to compIain about...

289
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:20,203
...the chapIain's hours
are between 4 and 5. Let's go.

290
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,039
Hit it!

291
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:25,244
Echevarria, you're a mystery to me.
I went through your fiIes.

292
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:26,920
You've been through
some heavy stuff.

293
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:31,080
Robbery, a gangIand kidnapping,
assauIt with a deadIy weapon.

294
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:34,557
-I had a very bad chiIdhood, sir.
-WeII, I figured something Iike that.

295
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:37,116
UntiI you made that withdrawaI
from the Bank of EngIand...

296
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:39,517
...with a .45 and a IittIe dynamite...

297
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,076
...you haven't done any heavy time,
have you?

298
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,761
-I aIways express sincere remorse, sir.
-Sure you do.

299
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:48,642
I mean, paroIe officers, judges...

300
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:51,037
...even cops wanted
to give you a break.

301
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,163
WeII, man-- I mean, major...

302
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:56,080
...I aIways figure, when you're
going for it, go aII out.

303
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,517
When you're in the streets,
raise heII.

304
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,645
But when they get you, they got you.

305
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,400
Be nice.

306
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,198
-WiII that be aII, major?
-That wiII be aII.

307
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:08,761
We won't be here that Iong.

308
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,282
WeII, gIad to be of service, sir.

309
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:13,199
Echevarria...

310
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:15,763
...my trench knife.

311
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,725
I mean, where you going?
Second time around, they hang you.

312
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,318
Can't change overnight, major.

313
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,124
Neither can I.

314
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:47,805
Take off.

315
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,719
Yes, sir.

316
00:20:56,727 --> 00:20:59,799
Knife! Recover!

317
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,198
Knife! Recover!

318
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:07,155
Knife! Recover!

319
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,160
Stick them, boy!

320
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,285
Hit the kraut, baby!

321
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:29,676
-Good, good.
-Knife!

322
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,360
Stick them, Shorty!
That's it.

323
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,643
Where did they get
your garrison cap, major?

324
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,684
I don't know, Stern.

325
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,997
EviI versus eviI, I guess.

326
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,039
Stick him, Shorty!

327
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:57,921
Stick that kraut again!
Come on, Shorty!

328
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,523
His name is Major Wright.

329
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,564
This is the onIy fiIm we have.

330
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:17,003
It was found next to
a dying newsreeI cameraman.

331
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,443
The fiIm was made during an attack
on the viIIage of Agrigento...

332
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:25,158
...in which the target is beIieved
to have been Benito MussoIini.

333
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:30,643
Our new contact says that even now,
this officer is training another group...

334
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,560
...drawn from American prisoners
sentenced to death...

335
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,445
...or Iong terms of imprisonment.

336
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:41,799
The whoIe story seems
a IittIe incredibIe, generaI.

337
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:45,084
Are you sure you're not wasting
money on this informant?

338
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,920
It is the opinion
of our senior agent in IreIand...

339
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:49,998
...that the story is absoIuteIy true.

340
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,237
WeII, maybe you're right.

341
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:56,036
The whoIe country worships
outIaws and gangsters.

342
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,196
Now they've drafted them
into the Army, I suppose.

343
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:03,246
I've made arrangements to receive
further reports from this informant.

344
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,762
And we wiII suppIy aII necessary
technicaI equipment...

345
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,282
...needed for transmission
in the future.

346
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,441
One moment, pIease.

347
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:15,802
The Reich's chanceIIery, generaI.

348
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:19,199
GeneraI Richter.

349
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,323
Yes, mein Führer.

350
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:25,879
No, mein Führer,
it wiII not be a probIem.

351
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:28,800
We shaII be in IstanbuI
on September the 3rd.

352
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:32,486
Yes, mein Führer.

353
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,080
Thank you.

354
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,566
If there is nothing further....

355
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:41,204
And you honestIy beIieve that this man
can take a bunch of misfits...

356
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,085
...murderers...

357
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:45,199
...and common thieves...

358
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,598
...and turn them into
a cohesive fighting machine?

359
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:53,520
Oh, it is not an entireIy
originaI concept, gentIemen:

360
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,561
A '' Iegion of the damned.''

361
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,238
OrdinariIy, I'd be the first man out...

362
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:07,205
...but since this is
our maiden voyage...

363
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:09,835
...Sergeant HoIt wiII do the honours.

364
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:11,838
What's the matter, Muñez?
You seem tense.

365
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,805
I signed up to kiII Germans,
not jump out of pIanes.

366
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,161
Wrong.

367
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,397
You were due to go down
one way or another.

368
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:22,037
Either six foot at the end of a rope,
or 6000 feet from an airpIane.

369
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:25,085
Look, you got yourseIf a good deaI.

370
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,156
I'II Iet you know when
I got a good deaI, major.

371
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:33,802
Now, ordinariIy, you'd have
severaI days for preparation...

372
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:36,640
...and your first jump
wouId have been in the daytime.

373
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,321
But there is no time.
Your next jump now...

374
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,599
...wiII be at night
and into YugosIavia.

375
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:45,681
Attach your cabIes.

376
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,519
Good Iuck.

377
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,560
Go!

378
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:04,761
D'Agostino?

379
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:07,361
What the heII's wrong with you,
D'Agostino?

380
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:08,721
I can't jump, major.

381
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,718
I never been good at heights.
I can't do it.

382
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,957
It's a heII of a time
to teII somebody, soIdier!

383
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:15,436
-Get up there and jump!
-No, major.

384
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:17,165
I can't. I'II get kiIIed, I know it.

385
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:21,605
You want everybody to know
that the hotshot syndicate hit man...

386
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,644
...has a yeIIow streak a miIe Iong?

387
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:25,365
I can't jump, major!

388
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,245
You're so cooI.

389
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:30,717
You even offered them a Iast drag
from your own cigarette...

390
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:32,843
...just before
you bIew their brains out.

391
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:34,486
-Want a cigarette?
-Jump, you bum.

392
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:37,286
-I got to go. I'II freeze my Ieg.
-Come on! Let's get going!

393
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:38,960
-Move it or miIk it.
-Come on.

394
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:41,516
-Come on, move it.
-It's freezing up here.

395
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:51,044
Come on, Iet's move! Geronimo!

396
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:02,481
Gotta be a nicer way to see
Europe again, right, Hoffman?

397
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,517
Hey, major, I'm an aII-American boy.

398
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:08,406
My parents just traveIIed around a Iot.

399
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:21,195
Oh, my God!

400
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:26,565
Last night...

401
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:28,479
...after Hoffman bounced...

402
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:31,684
...I had his body brought back here,
aIong with his parachute.

403
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:34,281
You think this was more than
a routine training accident?

404
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:37,120
I know now, Iieutenant,
that it was no accident.

405
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,517
The chute Iine on Hoffman's
parachute was cut.

406
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:43,123
He jumped out of that pIane with
the jump ring in perfect position...

407
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:44,800
...and the chute stiII didn't open.

408
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,119
I thought the men
packed their own chutes.

409
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:49,596
No, you're taIking about paratroopers,
Iieutenant.

410
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,485
My men are thieves and murderers.

411
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:54,764
These are prefoIded and put on
an airpIane by jump instructors.

412
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,077
Anybody couId have got
to Hoffman's parachute...

413
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:58,885
...even heIped him on with it.

414
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,720
You said it yourseIf, major.
You've got thieves and murderers.

415
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,525
So one found a reason
to kiII another.

416
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,757
Is that a reason for getting me
out here at night?

417
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:08,316
No. My reason is
Hoffman was one of my men.

418
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:09,966
And he was very important.

419
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:11,355
He spoke German.

420
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:14,519
He traveIIed in Europe for years
and he was famiIiar with YugosIavia...

421
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:16,518
...which wouId have been
a great heIp to me.

422
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,803
You're saying you need time
to find a repIacement?

423
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:22,039
There is no time, coIoneI. The Nazis
are gonna move those peopIe.

424
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:25,000
Major, you say that Hoffman
spent years in Europe...

425
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,283
...picking up Ianguages,
he knew the BaIkans.

426
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:30,086
I grew up in Europe.
I speak many European Ianguages...

427
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,761
...and I spent six summers
in the BaIkans and YugosIavia.

428
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,963
ApparentIy, for whatever reason,
Iieutenant...

429
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,640
...you want to go on this mission.

430
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:38,843
Let me point something out to you.

431
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,965
Now, for the rest of the training
and behind enemy Iines...

432
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,437
...your Iife wiII depend on men who've
committed every crime in the book...

433
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:48,201
...incIuding rape and murder.
Now, do you stiII want to go?

434
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:02,200
Hey, sarge, who's in the movies
tonight? Betty GrabIe, right?

435
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:04,483
Yeah, singing and dancing
her way into your heart.

436
00:28:04,647 --> 00:28:06,160
Come on, Iet's get out of the coId.

437
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:09,125
How come the major took off with
Hoffman's chute after he bounced?

438
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,039
The way I get aIong with the major...

439
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:13,482
...is whenever I have a big,
fat question for him...

440
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:15,603
...I forget aII about it.

441
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:18,561
-Hey, Iook, there's a dame in here!
-AII right, knock it off!

442
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,319
Knock it off.

443
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:22,843
Find yourseIves a seat and sit on it.

444
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,884
-We've met, haven't we?
-She's beautifuI.

445
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:28,686
This is Lieutenant CampbeII.

446
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:30,565
She'II be with us for the training...

447
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:32,399
...and she'II jump
with us into Europe.

448
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:35,677
AII right, keep in mind...

449
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,758
...that she's an officer...

450
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,599
...and any order she gives...

451
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,678
...wiII be obeyed immediateIy.
Is that cIear?

452
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,360
Yes, sir!

453
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:46,485
Even if she wants
to take advantage of us, sir?

454
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:50,281
-AII right, sergeant, hit the switch.
-Yes, sir.

455
00:28:57,927 --> 00:28:59,804
-Name?
-Kranz, WoIfgang.

456
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:03,243
-Importance to the party?
-SociaI pIanner and administrator.

457
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:05,557
Created the camps at Dachau
and BeIsen.

458
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,206
Very good, Stern.

459
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:13,041
-Name?
-UIrich Brunner. Lieutenant.

460
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:14,765
Importance to the party?

461
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,765
Some kind of banker, isn't he?

462
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:19,361
Yes, a principIed
young financiaI adviser...

463
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:21,836
...to the Reichminister, AIbert Speer.

464
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,918
SteeI, HeImut...

465
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,605
...physicaI cuIture prophet.

466
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,962
Directs a sexuaI revoIutionary
program...

467
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,442
...supposedIy aimed at impregnating
aII young women...

468
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,006
...throughout the Greater Reich.

469
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,806
Yeah? How do you Iike this guy,
Iieutenant?

470
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:41,319
I think we'II have to
cut his career short.

471
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:45,643
Now, remember those faces.

472
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:49,197
They won't aIways be wearing dress
uniforms and swastika armbands.

473
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:52,006
They may be in civiIian cIothes,
dressed as medicaI workers...

474
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,486
...or orthodox priests.

475
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:56,684
Hey, major, how come it has to be 1 2?
Suppose we onIy get you 1 0 or 1 1 ?

476
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:58,166
-Yeah, why not?
-No good.

477
00:29:58,327 --> 00:29:59,999
That one that's Ieft on that train...

478
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:03,125
...may be the heir apparent
to AdoIf HitIer, the next führer.

479
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:04,875
Hit the switch, sergeant.

480
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:09,361
The next is a captured German fiIm
on the occupation of YugosIavia.

481
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:11,006
You'II notice that aII the....

482
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,042
I ain't never seen
no garrison Iike this.

483
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:21,435
Me neither.

484
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:29,282
Who the heII smuggIed a bIue fiIm
into a maximum-security prison?

485
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:30,721
Echevarria?

486
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:32,161
I had nothing to do with this.

487
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:34,318
-It's a bum rap.
-No, of course not.

488
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:37,195
I beIieve I've aIready had
this course in training.

489
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,358
I'II be outside if you need me.

490
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:44,802
You're gonna miss the best part.

491
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,961
-ShaII I Iet it continue, sir?
-Yeah...

492
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:52,277
...might as weII see
how the other haIf Iives.

493
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,802
I Iike that, I Iike that.

494
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:08,402
I got this out of the mess haII.

495
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:11,406
The guards have got .45s
and machine guns.

496
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:13,956
-Did you forget about that?
-We'II get the major first.

497
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,721
He's got a .45 carbine, Iots of ammo.

498
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,567
Then we get the guard
at the barracks and we get his BAR.

499
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:22,241
We grab one of the trucks
and we disabIe aII the others.

500
00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:24,967
-Where do we go from here?
-West coast. IreIand's neutraI.

501
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:28,597
We grab a boat, we get to IreIand,
we puII a few jobs, get a stake.

502
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,281
-Hey, that's a great idea.
-Are you crazy?

503
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:33,438
You're right. It's a Iousy idea.

504
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,155
Who sticks the major?

505
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,803
I thought you'd do that, D'Agostino.

506
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,203
He kicked you out of the pIane.

507
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,715
Give me the knife.

508
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:49,284
You'II get aII three of us kiIIed...

509
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:51,836
-...and then crucify the others.
-What did you come for?

510
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,201
Because you asked us.

511
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:55,562
And we wanted to see
how many other men were crazy.

512
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:57,685
Yeah, that's right.
We ain't that crazy.

513
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:37,726
Easy. Easy, Shorty. Easy!

514
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:40,957
Easy. Hey, easy.

515
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,879
You okay? Are you okay?

516
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:45,003
Yeah, I'm aII right.

517
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,920
Hey, these guys ain't nice.

518
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:50,362
Hey. Now, go on back
to your bunks...

519
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:53,121
...and don't get any more
bright ideas.

520
00:32:57,847 --> 00:32:59,041
Good night, major.

521
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,046
Way to go, champ.

522
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:06,846
Way to go, buddy. AII right.

523
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,723
Just remember,
if this was the reaI thing...

524
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:25,606
...and you move too soon,
you'd be spotted by the engineers...

525
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,317
...or the German passengers
inside the cars.

526
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,275
They'd stop the train
and just scoop us up...

527
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:34,439
...and we'd never get near anybody
we want to get on it.

528
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:41,084
Take positions.

529
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:12,437
By the numbers. One...

530
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:15,687
..two, three, four...

531
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,079
...five, six...

532
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:20,641
...seven...

533
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:23,844
...eight, nine...

534
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:26,919
...1 0, 1 1 , 1 2.

535
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:00,685
AII right. Moving back.

536
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:04,078
-Who's in charge here?
-AII right, faII out.

537
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,643
Where the heII's the truck?

538
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,557
Look, here comes the major.

539
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:25,124
AII right, you did a good job.

540
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,523
And I'm reasonabIy happy
with your work.

541
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:30,520
This truck here,
it's haIf fuII of booze.

542
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:32,959
FaII out.

543
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:36,085
-AII right.
-CoIIins, Echevarria...

544
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:38,238
...drop the taiIgate.

545
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:41,080
And carefuI with the cargo.

546
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,762
Hey, that's it, baby.

547
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:51,963
I assume you can handIe
aII of that.

548
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,600
Now, girIs, your prime minister
is Iooking forward...

549
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,758
...to decorating each one of you
individuaIIy.

550
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:59,485
Okay, so hurry it up.

551
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,681
Good-Iooking. Good.

552
00:36:03,847 --> 00:36:05,075
-Give me one.
-Here you go.

553
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:11,359
My name's Lonnie.

554
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,679
-I know where to take you.
-CarefuI.

555
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:15,041
Hey, watch it.

556
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:16,960
You brought stockings in nyIon?

557
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:19,482
-Baby.
-Here's another one.

558
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:22,959
Freddie!

559
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:27,238
-I've found you, Iove.
-You Iook great.

560
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:28,601
Give us a kiss.

561
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,284
Are you something
Iike our commandos, then?

562
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:36,007
TeII me about it in the morning,
baby, okay?

563
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:47,277
Baby, I haven't danced
since grad night. Come on.

564
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:56,962
-Yeah, that's it.
-I can't beIieve it!

565
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:07,238
We haven't been
formaIIy introduced yet.

566
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:09,398
Carmine D'Agostino.

567
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,278
WeII, Iieutenant,
the major appears to have...

568
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,881
...some kind of unusuaI
night manoeuvre in progress.

569
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:45,279
Yes, sir. I beIieve he referred to it as
'' improving reIations with our aIIies.''

570
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,880
Indeed.

571
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,679
CoIoneI. WeII, I didn't expect to
see you out in the fieId, so to speak.

572
00:37:56,847 --> 00:37:59,520
I can see that. No, thank you.

573
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:02,679
You reaIize this IittIe orgy
couId get you court-martiaIIed.

574
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,281
These are sentenced prisoners
convicted of capitaI crimes.

575
00:38:05,447 --> 00:38:08,803
They're aIso ready for battIe, coIoneI.
Come on, give them a break.

576
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,037
Major, if you couId bear
to tear yourseIf away...

577
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,277
...the generaI is waiting for you
down the road.

578
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:14,846
Did he want to join the party?

579
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:16,565
CoIIins.

580
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,763
Get Iucky, soIdier.

581
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:25,115
-You wanted to see me, major?
-I've got a probIem, sir.

582
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,642
We have severaI.
We have two reports.

583
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,286
One from inside YugosIavia...

584
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:32,519
...indicating suddenIy increased
security in aII the major cities.

585
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,406
You picked YugosIavia because
it's on the Orient Express route.

586
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,603
That's right. The partisans
are expecting you.

587
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,041
But the second report...

588
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:43,086
...is that the Nazis are beginning
to Iearn about you and what you do.

589
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:44,965
WeII, I'm not surprised.

590
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:46,640
What the heII
are you taIking about?

591
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,877
I beIieve there's a traitor
in our group.

592
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:51,117
-Do you know who he is?
-No, not yet.

593
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,164
But he got to Hoffman's parachute...

594
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,602
...and he wouId have been invaIuabIe
in YugosIavia.

595
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,961
I went through the foIders.

596
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,516
There's no way Hoffman
couId've met any of these men...

597
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:01,279
...before coming to the prison.

598
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:03,600
No, the Germans
ordered the kiIIing.

599
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,759
But how couId the Nazis have known
who you were going to pick?

600
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,680
They couIdn't.
ObviousIy, our Mr. Somebody...

601
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,964
...he got in touch with the Germans
after I assigned him to the mission.

602
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:15,641
You know there's a bIue fiIm
smuggIed into the camp?

603
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:17,525
And if you can
smuggIe a bIue fiIm in...

604
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:20,236
...you certainIy couId smuggIe
a message out.

605
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:21,999
Then we have to abort the mission.

606
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,680
How do we do that, CIark?

607
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,725
The heirs apparent to the Third Reich
Ieave Munich tonight.

608
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:30,165
They'II arrive in IstanbuI
in three days.

609
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,526
That's some party.

610
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,440
Why don't you join us?

611
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:41,043
If I joined that party,
I'm afraid I'd Iose my bars.

612
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,120
How Iong have you been an officer,
Lieutenant CampbeII?

613
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:47,845
Five months.

614
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:49,486
I was given a direct commission...

615
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:51,877
...because I have certain skiIIs
and education...

616
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:54,356
...over and above
what's needed there.

617
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,638
You're just Iike the rest
of the Dirty Dozen.

618
00:39:56,807 --> 00:39:58,399
-Yeah.
-We aII got certain skiIIs...

619
00:39:58,567 --> 00:39:59,795
...and education too.

620
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,844
You know what's ironic?

621
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:05,916
Those men committed crimes,
they were put in prison...

622
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,362
...and they got this mission.

623
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:12,641
I wouId've been wiIIing
to give everything I have.

624
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:14,160
Maybe my Iife.

625
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm sorry.

626
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,000
No. Don't stop now.

627
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,805
By dad is a Foreign Service officer.

628
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:33,604
He married a Norwegian woman
when he was stationed in OsIo.

629
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,200
When the Nazis hit Norway...

630
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,439
...my mother had gone home
to get her famiIy out.

631
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:41,682
She died in the first bombing raid.

632
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:44,560
I'm sorry.

633
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,358
I'm reaIIy sorry.

634
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:57,481
Now, we can try an air strike
at the train in open country...

635
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:59,683
...but we can't be sure
they'd get aII 1 2.

636
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:03,044
And then, we couId give this
to British inteIIigence at AIexandria.

637
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,596
Hey, wait a minute.
How about my men?

638
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:08,486
I mean, they've been working
damn hard and they're ready to go!

639
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:12,720
My staff is right.
You reaIIy do become one of them.

640
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:18,246
-They'd have to go back to prison.
-Now wait a minute, generaI.

641
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:20,921
If you send these men
back to do time and die...

642
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:22,679
...you'II have a riot on your hands.

643
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,520
And you may be right.
I might be fighting on their side.

644
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:28,440
What do you want? You've got
a traitor and don't know who it is.

645
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:32,316
I don't know who it is, but I'II find out
who it is and get rid of him.

646
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:35,923
Besides bIowing up the Nazis
or die trying.

647
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,842
And that's the name of the game
when it comes to the Dirty Dozen.

648
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:47,159
Besides drinking and whoring...

649
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:49,283
...and faIIing down.

650
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:51,881
And one of them is a traitor.

651
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:18,683
We're approaching
the jump area, major.

652
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:21,441
We'II be turning on the ready Iight
at any moment.

653
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,361
Let's see.

654
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:25,961
Coordinates 41 35-2794,
is that right?

655
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,958
WeII, of course, sir. Any probIem?

656
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:31,039
No, no, no. No probIem.
Except we're not gonna jump there.

657
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:34,564
Yes, I want you to change course
5 degrees south of Skopje...

658
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:38,197
...and bypass the jump area
by some 20 miIes. Have you got that?

659
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:39,925
Very irreguIar.
Breaking the pIan.

660
00:42:40,087 --> 00:42:43,636
WeII, my whoIe group is irreguIar,
gentIemen. That's part of their job.

661
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:45,399
We'II have to report it to our C.O.

662
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,683
I don't care how many reports
you make, captain...

663
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:53,922
...just as Iong as the new coordinates
are 41 31 -2795. Have you got that?

664
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:01,444
Hey, what the heII's going on here?

665
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:03,040
We're changing directions.

666
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:10,360
Major, if we don't jump
where we pIanned...

667
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:12,324
...how wiII we Iink up
with the Resistance?

668
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:13,715
You Iet me worry about that.

669
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:16,117
I've got an address in Skopje.

670
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:18,721
You and I wiII find it, Demchuk.

671
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:27,316
-They are running Iate, Vasco.
-They'II be here. My sister received--

672
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,841
Something's gone wrong.
I have to get back to Skopje.

673
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:06,077
We have to get out of here
in any case.

674
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,719
Whatever happens, I need
one prisoner for interrogation.

675
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:14,480
We'II take those six.

676
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:19,679
You men, surrender!

677
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:45,287
I have your prisoner
for interrogation, captain.

678
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:47,320
Keep him aIive.

679
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,481
Don't Iook down, sir.

680
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:46,239
Look at them as if you hate them...

681
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:48,238
...and they wiII be sure
you are YugosIav.

682
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:17,126
-Yes?
-Ares is the god of war.

683
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,722
And we are aII his chiIdren.

684
00:46:20,887 --> 00:46:22,081
Come in.

685
00:46:25,727 --> 00:46:27,445
-Stand stiII!
-Take their guns!

686
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:28,926
Now, what the heII is this?

687
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,520
Keep quiet!
Check the ammunition.

688
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:36,759
U.S. Army, standard issue,
.45-caIibre ammunition, brand-new.

689
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,839
-Who are you Iooking for?
-I aIready gave you the password.

690
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:43,397
It couId have been tortured out of men
who then had their tongues torn out.

691
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,922
-Who are you Iooking for?
-A partisan Ieader.

692
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:48,647
InitiaIs Y.V.

693
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,637
I am YeIena Vascovic.

694
00:46:53,087 --> 00:46:55,965
No one eIse knew
that you had onIy my initiaIs.

695
00:46:56,127 --> 00:46:58,083
What happened Iast night?

696
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:01,284
Look, I can taIk a Iot better without
that cannon pointing at my head.

697
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:04,557
PIease, I'm sorry.

698
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:06,558
I understand.

699
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:09,161
I ordered an overfIight
over the Ianding area.

700
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,841
I had a hunch that the Germans
were there waiting for us.

701
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:13,759
No partisan wouId give you
to the Germans.

702
00:47:13,927 --> 00:47:15,679
Hey, I didn't say that.

703
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:19,442
We had orders that, for whatever
reason we didn't make any contact...

704
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:21,598
...we were to come here.
So here we are.

705
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:24,156
The men that were supposed
to meet you did not come back.

706
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,204
We have heard no word
aII night from them.

707
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:28,722
It's best to assume they were taken.

708
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,559
One of them was my brother.

709
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:35,643
If they were Iucky,
they had a chance to fight.

710
00:47:36,327 --> 00:47:38,921
Can we get a message to the
British submarine off the coast?

711
00:47:39,087 --> 00:47:41,078
-Yes, of course.
-TeII them we made it.

712
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:51,926
EagIe Four to Lion One.
EagIe Four to Lion One.

713
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:53,315
Can you read me?

714
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:56,877
Yes, this is Lion One.
Go ahead, please.

715
00:47:57,687 --> 00:48:01,965
This is EagIe Four.
Encrypt: 7-1 87-9.

716
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:07,042
Close encrypt.* 1 9-2 7-24.

717
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:09,564
The visitors have arrived.

718
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,321
Very good. I have a message
from Overlord in London.

719
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:14,398
Can you get out of Sk opje at once?

720
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:18,082
They must be reacting to your
decision to overfIy the Ianding site.

721
00:48:18,247 --> 00:48:19,680
TeII me what's wrong.

722
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:22,486
Nothing's wrong. We're on our way.

723
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:25,762
-Affirmative.
-Very good.

724
00:48:25,927 --> 00:48:27,519
Cheerio.

725
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:33,442
Look, I'm sorry your brother
came to meet us Iast night.

726
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:37,282
My brother, God wiIIing, is dead.

727
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,441
He's Iost consciousness again.

728
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:56,563
Yes, I can see that.

729
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:59,560
I asked you to find out where
Major Wright wiII attack the train...

730
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:02,366
...and after hours of interrogation,
you have no resuIts.

731
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:04,961
Forgive me. WouId it not be better
to hoId up the train...

732
00:49:05,127 --> 00:49:06,321
...or take another route?

733
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:09,126
What expIanation
am I supposed to give the führer?

734
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:11,482
That I cannot save his men
from a renegade major...

735
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:13,365
...and 1 2 common criminaIs?

736
00:49:25,687 --> 00:49:27,325
Where do you want to hit that train?

737
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:30,559
This is the pIan I briefed my men on:
We go through open country...

738
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:33,442
...and we meet the train here,
near Nish.

739
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:36,724
There's an overpass about 20 miIes
north of the BuIgarian border...

740
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:38,081
...near Pirot.

741
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:40,715
The train sIows down there
because of a grade.

742
00:49:40,887 --> 00:49:42,479
And I've trained my men...

743
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,956
...to jump on these moving cars
from the overpass...

744
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:46,958
...to take out these Nazi hotshots.

745
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:50,244
I'II expIain it to my men. If they have
any probIems, I'II Iet you know.

746
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:59,198
WeII, what can I do for you, Stern?

747
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,278
The men are a IittIe confused, major.

748
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:03,005
Oh, a IittIe scared, maybe?

749
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,442
A Iot of things have been happening
that don't add up.

750
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:07,484
Hoffman jumps out of that pIane
and bounces.

751
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:09,877
Hoffman was kiIIed
in a training accident.

752
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,959
OnIy you grabbed the body and the
chute and got him out of there.

753
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:14,719
We don't jump
where we're supposed to...

754
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,037
...we don't go to Skopje,
we wind up in the hiIIs.

755
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:20,199
If you wanted to jump down with
the Germans and waIk in Skopje...

756
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:21,561
...you be my guest.

757
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,126
What the heII's going on, major?

758
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:28,357
AII right. You're entitIed to know.

759
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:30,643
There's a ringer
in the Dirty Dozen this time.

760
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:34,519
That's right, something rotten.

761
00:50:34,687 --> 00:50:37,759
A Judas who's seIIing us aII out.

762
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:42,240
CouIdn't it be the YugosIavians?

763
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:46,116
No, the YugosIavs
didn't sIice Hoffman's chute Iine.

764
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:50,079
It's one of us, cIoser to home.

765
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:57,765
Yes?

766
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:00,639
BeIgrade, generaI.

767
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,598
GeneraI Richter.

768
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:08,283
Give me the coordinates.

769
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:11,484
Notify Oberkommando BerIin
immediateIy.

770
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:14,639
No, never mind,
I wiII make the caII myseIf.

771
00:51:32,527 --> 00:51:34,722
They attacked here
Iess than an hour ago.

772
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:38,243
But, sir, our information was
that they wouId go on to Nish.

773
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:40,085
That's right.

774
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:43,843
Major Wright did not parachute in
where we expected him.

775
00:51:44,007 --> 00:51:46,396
He didn't attack
where we expected him.

776
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:50,480
I doubt very much if he'II attack
the train where we expect him.

777
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:54,644
Get a pIane ready to Ieave
in 1 5 minutes.

778
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:57,277
FiIe fIight information for Sofia.

779
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:10,396
-He's dead, sir.
-Yes, I can see that, captain.

780
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:47,798
I thought we were going
through open country.

781
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:49,958
The major keeps changing his mind,
I guess.

782
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:52,561
-You know what I been thinking?
-I got no idea.

783
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:54,558
I never had a Iieutenant before.

784
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:15,125
You're taking the body to Pirot
for buriaI and returning today?

785
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:17,678
Was Iast wish of deceased.

786
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:20,886
-Your papers seem to be in order.
-Wait a minute.

787
00:53:25,847 --> 00:53:27,439
What viIIage are you from?

788
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:29,598
Kumanovo, sir.
Just few miIes from here.

789
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:31,997
I know where the damn viIIage is.

790
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,915
How many partisans are hiding there,
waiting to murder German soIdiers?

791
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:40,923
None, sir, that I know of.

792
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:42,600
Lying.

793
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:45,445
Damned Macedonians.

794
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:50,486
In mourning, are you?

795
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:54,720
For a dear departed souI, yes.

796
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:05,684
You couId aImost be German.

797
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:09,279
Nordic. Pure.

798
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:16,757
Pure in this country of swine.

799
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:21,200
Open the coffin.

800
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:24,359
I want to see if you're smuggIing
anything across the border...

801
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:25,755
...besides the dead.

802
00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:28,236
Sir, it was cIosed after hoIy service.

803
00:54:28,407 --> 00:54:30,716
-In this Iife, there is--
-Then I wiII open it.

804
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:32,115
Yeah?

805
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:03,115
AII right, there must be
a phone in there.

806
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:44,486
BeIgrade is trying to caII back.
They must have got through.

807
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:46,717
AII right, we'II be out of here
in five minutes...

808
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:48,639
...and it'II be dark in a haIf-hour.

809
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,924
ReguIar Army aII the way,
right, sergeant?

810
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:51,641
Yes, sir.

811
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:54,082
Look, I got Muñez's dog tags.

812
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:56,203
If anything shouId happen to me...

813
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:59,279
-...get those tags back, if you can.
-Yes, sir.

814
00:56:59,447 --> 00:57:01,517
We're supposed to attack the train
on the border.

815
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:06,397
But I've just toId YeIena:
The reaI target? East of Sofia.

816
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:16,444
So my Iast year in schooI...

817
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:20,316
...I was either gonna get married
or try for the Foreign Service.

818
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:23,202
Must have been
a heII of a tough decision.

819
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:28,122
Don't Iaugh.
I might have been a very good wife...

820
00:57:28,287 --> 00:57:30,960
...andIor a reasonabIy bright
Foreign Service officer.

821
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:33,756
Might have been?
Can't you stiII be?

822
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:37,758
I don't think that far ahead
in the future, Joe.

823
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:39,758
Not anymore.

824
00:57:41,447 --> 00:57:44,439
What about you?
No postwar pIans?

825
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:48,967
I've been in the war a Iong time.

826
00:57:49,447 --> 00:57:50,880
No other way to go?

827
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:52,400
No.

828
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:54,797
I don't know of one, anyway.

829
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:57,720
WeII, that's not aItogether true.

830
00:57:57,887 --> 00:58:01,721
It's just that sometimes...

831
00:58:02,247 --> 00:58:05,444
...I want to give every Jew in the worId
an automatic weapon and say:

832
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,998
'' HoId on to this, you're gonna need it
just to stay aIive in this century.''

833
00:58:11,047 --> 00:58:14,084
And other times I think, '' My God,
there must be some time...

834
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:19,801
...when I don't have to kiII
just to stay aIive.''

835
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:38,559
-Good morning, gentIemen.
-Good morning.

836
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,206
What's the Iatest, coIoneI?

837
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:42,437
We have an underground report
from BeIgrade.

838
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:44,916
There was no attack
on the train Iast night...

839
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:47,442
...and they crossed into BuIgaria
roughIy an hour ago.

840
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,916
What about the EngIish
Submarine Force in the Adriatic?

841
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:52,442
No word since the Iast communication
from Skopje.

842
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:54,837
The assumption is the Germans
seized the apartment...

843
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:56,918
...and destroyed
the communications equipment.

844
00:58:57,087 --> 00:59:02,400
WeII, maybe he's just afraid to use it
untiI he finds out who's on his side.

845
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:07,038
GeneraI, that train is one haIf day's
journey from the Turkish border.

846
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:08,686
The moment it crosses the border...

847
00:59:08,847 --> 00:59:11,361
...any attack upon it
is an act of war on Turkey.

848
00:59:11,807 --> 00:59:13,877
What the heII
do you want from me, CIark?

849
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,321
I'm sure Wright wiII attack...

850
00:59:15,487 --> 00:59:17,557
...when he sees
there's some chance to succeed.

851
00:59:18,127 --> 00:59:19,958
GeneraI, I've taken the Iiberty...

852
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:22,721
...of aIerting the 1 2th Fighter
Command at AIexandria.

853
00:59:22,887 --> 00:59:24,878
But I thought we ruIed out pIanes...

854
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:26,560
...because we couIdn't be sure...

855
00:59:26,727 --> 00:59:29,924
...of hitting 1 2 men in one raiIroad car
from the air.

856
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:33,805
You have an estimate?

857
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:36,640
They couId scrambIe and attack
the train at 1 200 hours today...

858
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,479
...whiIst it's stiII in BuIgaria...

859
00:59:38,647 --> 00:59:40,797
...with a very good chance
of compIete success.

860
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,719
If the 1 2th Fighter group
attacks...

861
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:45,082
...the same time that the major
and his peopIe do...

862
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:48,842
...we won't have to worry about the
Germans kiIIing off aII the Dirty Dozen.

863
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:51,601
We'II bIow them up ourseIves.

864
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:57,965
If that happens,
it's war and it can't be heIped.

865
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:03,203
You know, CIark,
you're a heII of a good officer...

866
01:00:04,047 --> 01:00:06,038
...but you are a bastard.

867
01:00:07,967 --> 01:00:11,482
Now, what's the Iast moment
they can go in from AIexandria?

868
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:14,998
-0900 hours, sir.
-We'II wait.

869
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:18,845
-GeneraI, any deIay now--
-I said, we'II wait.

870
01:00:21,247 --> 01:00:24,683
At 0900 hours,
if we haven't heard from him...

871
01:00:25,327 --> 01:00:29,718
...Major Wright and his command
wiII be considered Iost in action.

872
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:32,965
And we'II go
to an aIternative soIution.

873
01:00:36,487 --> 01:00:40,275
Sergeant HoIt seemed surprised
that you changed the pIans again.

874
01:00:40,447 --> 01:00:44,804
Yes, something different
from what the men expected, right?

875
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:47,003
From the first moment
you came to my apartment...

876
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:49,442
...I knew that something was wrong.

877
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:51,882
My men are dying too.

878
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:54,242
Isn't it time that you teII me more?

879
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:59,037
It's time I toId you that
aII the information I give to my men...

880
01:00:59,207 --> 01:01:00,959
...is transmitted
right to the Germans...

881
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:03,561
...probabIy by a high-powered
mini-transmitter.

882
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,195
Then you have to find the traitor
and kiII him.

883
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:08,323
No, I gotta be very carefuI.

884
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:13,436
If I shake up the men too much now,
they couId turn on each other bIindIy.

885
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:16,326
No, he'II make a wrong move
and I'II naiI him.

886
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:23,681
God heIp us.

887
01:01:38,647 --> 01:01:40,478
Your papers?

888
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:35,323
You've never seen
a bridge before, huh?

889
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:39,116
Oh, sorry, sir.
He aImost never Ieaves the farm.

890
01:02:40,807 --> 01:02:43,446
You have any papers, dummy?

891
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,515
He was giving you a bad time?

892
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,643
WeII, you couId say that.

893
01:03:22,647 --> 01:03:24,080
Move it!

894
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,446
Good morning, gentIemen.

895
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,121
As you know, we are within
hours of the Turkish border...

896
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:27,757
...and within the confines of our
esteemed Axis aIIy, BuIgaria.

897
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:30,361
WiII you join us
for the rest of the trip?

898
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:32,677
I regret I have one Iast mission
to attend to.

899
01:04:32,847 --> 01:04:35,441
But I shaII see you aII
in IstanbuI tonight.

900
01:04:35,607 --> 01:04:38,838
Let me impress upon you
the need for continued security.

901
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:40,360
But I assure you...

902
01:04:40,527 --> 01:04:42,438
...the führer's commands
wiII be fuIfiIIed.

903
01:04:42,607 --> 01:04:45,246
Speaking of the führer's commands,
GeneraI Richter...

904
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:48,922
...I have here a Ietter
deIivered to me in Munich...

905
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:52,523
...signed by AdoIf HitIer in BerIin,
three days ago.

906
01:04:52,687 --> 01:04:54,598
The reason I have not
mentioned it before...

907
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:57,440
...is because I feIt we were
stiII in grave danger.

908
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:59,996
Security is essentiaI.

909
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:02,086
GentIemen...

910
01:05:02,247 --> 01:05:05,080
...the Thousand-Year Reich
is in our hands...

911
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:07,603
...in train car 2420.

912
01:05:14,647 --> 01:05:16,877
'' I send my heartfeIt good wishes
to those invoIved...

913
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:19,607
...in this great
and needed enterprise.

914
01:05:19,767 --> 01:05:22,804
I saIute those who wiII spread
the seeds of greater Germany...

915
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:25,276
...throughout the worId.

916
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:27,403
Whatever happens to me...

917
01:05:27,567 --> 01:05:31,162
...our finaI victory
remains inevitabIe.

918
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:34,115
AccordingIy, I now designate
as my successor...

919
01:05:34,287 --> 01:05:37,120
...and as the Ieader
of the Fourth Reich...

920
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,961
...Major GeneraI of the Waffen S.S...

921
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,003
...KarI Richter.''

922
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:46,200
Signed...

923
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:48,517
...AdoIf HitIer.

924
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:19,321
What the heII is going on?

925
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:10,801
Peter!

926
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,085
We're coming through, sergeant.

927
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:56,996
We have met the enemy, sir.

928
01:09:57,567 --> 01:09:58,966
They are gone.

929
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:00,685
Good job.

930
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:02,041
Damn good job.

931
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:04,516
AII right, Iet's see what we got.

932
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:17,239
Must be aImost a fuII dozen
of them there.

933
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:18,840
What do you think?

934
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:21,237
You know the mission.

935
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:24,755
Don't shoot! We surrender.

936
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,558
HoId it. We're taking prisoners.

937
01:10:29,687 --> 01:10:31,325
We may need them Iater.

938
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:33,523
Those are the bastards
who started aII this.

939
01:10:38,807 --> 01:10:40,763
That's an order, Stern.

940
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:54,680
Throw out your weapons.

941
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,361
You can do it, major.

942
01:11:16,847 --> 01:11:18,200
Don't Iet us down.

943
01:11:29,927 --> 01:11:33,283
Most of the hotshot high-ranking
Nazis are back there, Dravko.

944
01:11:33,447 --> 01:11:34,926
CouId be our ticket home.

945
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:38,079
I don't understand.
Where can we go?

946
01:11:38,247 --> 01:11:40,920
Lieutenant CampbeII and I,
we found a spur Iine on the map...

947
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:44,284
...right down to the Aegean.
Cutting through the tip of Greece.

948
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:46,915
YeIena and I wiII contact
the British sub in the area.

949
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:51,763
Who knows? A hundred miIes
ahead, and we might make it.

950
01:12:50,607 --> 01:12:52,598
Hey, Demchuk.

951
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,602
-Where's the major?
-He's checking out that car.

952
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,284
I better cover him.

953
01:13:27,727 --> 01:13:30,116
Decide to go to the other side
for good, D'Agostino?

954
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:42,837
What can I say, major?
How did you guess?

955
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:45,077
Nothing to say and nothing to do.

956
01:13:45,247 --> 01:13:46,839
But I'm curious.

957
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,237
When WiIson decided to escape...

958
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:51,318
...you pretended
to side with him. Why?

959
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:57,839
He was taIking about IreIand.

960
01:13:58,007 --> 01:14:00,362
I was aIready taIking
to the German consuIate there.

961
01:14:00,527 --> 01:14:02,995
You wouId've kiIIed three of them,
brought me their heads.

962
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:04,725
If it got to be necessary.

963
01:14:04,887 --> 01:14:07,003
I had to deIiver the whoIe group.

964
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:09,727
OnIy CoIIins saved me the troubIe.

965
01:14:20,727 --> 01:14:24,606
So the high drama about you being
afraid to jump out of the airpIane...

966
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:28,282
...was just to cover up the fact that
you sIiced Hoffman's chute, right?

967
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:33,567
Major, I grew up hanging out
the window of a 1 5-fIoor tenement.

968
01:14:33,727 --> 01:14:37,037
Now don't teII me you're
a native-born fascist, Carmine.

969
01:14:37,207 --> 01:14:38,640
You did it for the money, right?

970
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,240
Hey, major.

971
01:14:40,407 --> 01:14:41,601
Money.

972
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:44,406
Lots of money.

973
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:47,286
That's what makes
the worId go round.

974
01:14:52,007 --> 01:14:54,043
See you in heII.

975
01:15:10,287 --> 01:15:12,278
See you in heII.

976
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,559
Right.

977
01:15:26,207 --> 01:15:27,959
Come on. Get your back into it!

978
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,677
Move it!

979
01:15:30,847 --> 01:15:32,565
Come on!

980
01:15:32,727 --> 01:15:34,877
That's right.

981
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:37,117
-Stop!
-HoId on, hoId it up.

982
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,642
HoId it up!

983
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:42,480
Bring it back.
We might need that tankfuI of gas.

984
01:15:42,647 --> 01:15:44,285
You mean, Ieave it in front of us?

985
01:15:44,447 --> 01:15:48,122
CoupIe it on and we'II push it
aII the way to Greece.

986
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,564
-AII right.
-AII right!

987
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:53,878
-Let's go!
-Come on, move it!

988
01:16:10,727 --> 01:16:13,287
Begin immediate overfIights
of the train as it moves south.

989
01:16:13,447 --> 01:16:15,802
SureIy they cannot take
the train to the Turkish border.

990
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:17,525
Let's find the train first, captain.

991
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:19,643
Then we shaII decide
exactIy where it's going.

992
01:16:19,807 --> 01:16:22,526
Make sure none of the pIanes
fire on the train at this moment.

993
01:16:22,687 --> 01:16:23,881
How eIse can they stop them?

994
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:26,844
I'II stop them.

995
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,237
We don't know how many
of our peopIe are stiII aIive.

996
01:16:29,407 --> 01:16:32,604
They have tremendous vaIue
to this Major Wright, as hostages.

997
01:16:32,767 --> 01:16:34,485
He wiII be aware of that.

998
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:22,356
EagIe Four to Lion One.
Come in, pIease.

999
01:17:24,487 --> 01:17:27,797
EagIe Four to Lion One.
Come in, pIease.

1000
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:33,079
We may be too far away. I don't know
if they can pick us up anymore.

1001
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:36,042
EagIe Four to Lion One.
Come in, pIease.

1002
01:17:36,207 --> 01:17:38,437
Lion One to Eagle Four.
Are you there?

1003
01:17:38,607 --> 01:17:42,361
Yes, we are here.
Encrypt: 7-1 87-9.

1004
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:46,315
Close encrypt.* 1 9-2 7-24.

1005
01:17:46,487 --> 01:17:48,443
Give them these coordinates first.

1006
01:17:48,647 --> 01:17:52,765
TeII them I want a rendezvous on the
second set of coordinates at 1 030.

1007
01:17:52,927 --> 01:17:59,002
We are proceeding south
passing at 41 23-21 79.

1008
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:03,285
Can you arrange a rendezvous
with us at 41 28-21 85?

1009
01:18:03,447 --> 01:18:06,962
It will tak e some doing, but we'll try
to have one of our subs there.

1010
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:09,724
What is your ETA?

1011
01:18:09,887 --> 01:18:11,286
1 030 hours.

1012
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:13,244
Very good. Cheerio.

1013
01:18:13,407 --> 01:18:15,079
Good job, YeIena.

1014
01:18:15,247 --> 01:18:18,080
With any Iuck, I'II be abIe to buy you
a drink in London next week.

1015
01:18:18,247 --> 01:18:20,522
It wouId be nice
to have a drink in London.

1016
01:18:20,687 --> 01:18:22,723
I haven't been there
since my honeymoon.

1017
01:18:22,887 --> 01:18:25,685
-Seems Iike a thousand years ago.
-How Iong ago was it?

1018
01:18:25,847 --> 01:18:27,803
-Seven years.
-And your husband?

1019
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:31,240
KiIIed by the Germans
in the first week of the war.

1020
01:18:32,247 --> 01:18:34,078
WeII, how about
the rest of your famiIy?

1021
01:18:34,247 --> 01:18:35,726
Some of them are dead.

1022
01:18:35,887 --> 01:18:38,765
Some I don't know
if they're Iiving or dead.

1023
01:18:39,327 --> 01:18:41,124
My brother, weII....

1024
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:44,279
You know what must have
happened to my brother.

1025
01:18:47,127 --> 01:18:49,880
Yes, I know.

1026
01:18:51,447 --> 01:18:53,358
WeII, Iook,
why don't you come with us.

1027
01:18:53,527 --> 01:18:56,599
I mean, they got a YugosIav
government-in-exiIe in London.

1028
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,678
You know, they'II put you to work.

1029
01:18:58,847 --> 01:19:00,644
Then you can
come back here after the war.

1030
01:19:01,847 --> 01:19:05,556
-When you say it, major, I beIieve It.
-You better beIieve it.

1031
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:16,438
Hey, major, most of these guys
speak better EngIish than I do.

1032
01:19:16,607 --> 01:19:20,202
Yeah? Don't worry.
Look what happened to them.

1033
01:19:30,887 --> 01:19:33,162
-Echevarria?
-Major.

1034
01:19:34,807 --> 01:19:36,525
And how you doing, Joe?

1035
01:19:36,687 --> 01:19:39,247
If I had my choice between
touring the BaIkans with you...

1036
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,398
...or running a nightcIub in Paris...

1037
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,319
...caII me '' Mr. Show Biz.''

1038
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,523
You'II be aII right.

1039
01:19:51,447 --> 01:19:55,804
AII right, contact the commanding
officer of the 1 2th in AIexandria.

1040
01:19:55,967 --> 01:19:59,164
TeII him to execute
an immediate attack on that train.

1041
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,887
TeII him to take it out compIeteIy.

1042
01:20:02,487 --> 01:20:04,364
KiII anything in sight.

1043
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,685
Very good, sir.

1044
01:20:07,487 --> 01:20:11,321
GeneraI, as you know, I haven't been
a great admirer of Major Wright...

1045
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:13,955
...but I'm sure he and his men
had a damn good try.

1046
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:16,598
WeII, that's damn nice
of you, coIoneI.

1047
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:18,519
-But time is of--
-Excuse me, generaI.

1048
01:20:18,687 --> 01:20:21,997
We have just received word
from the British submarine Lion One.

1049
01:20:22,647 --> 01:20:26,196
Major Wright has attacked the train
just outside of Sofia, BuIgaria...

1050
01:20:26,367 --> 01:20:28,244
...and is on his way to the Aegean.

1051
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:32,638
AII right!

1052
01:21:23,487 --> 01:21:26,206
You know, major, there may be 1 2
high-ranking party members...

1053
01:21:26,367 --> 01:21:28,119
...or government officiaIs
upon that train.

1054
01:21:28,287 --> 01:21:31,484
-Yes, generaI.
-If I caII for a cease-fire, negotiations...

1055
01:21:31,647 --> 01:21:34,036
...take no further actions
untiI I give the command.

1056
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:35,799
I understand, generaI.

1057
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:39,764
The prime concern, of course,
is to rescue our men.

1058
01:21:40,247 --> 01:21:41,965
The second concern
is to make sure...

1059
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:45,676
...that none of these damned
Americans Ieave here aIive.

1060
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:56,925
There they are, sergeant.

1061
01:22:57,087 --> 01:22:58,486
AII right, spread the word.

1062
01:22:58,647 --> 01:23:00,922
Get everybody off the train.
Go ahead. Move it.

1063
01:23:01,087 --> 01:23:03,806
What about the Nazis in 2420?

1064
01:23:04,447 --> 01:23:08,201
