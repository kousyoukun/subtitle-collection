1
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:39,090
Long ago, when l was a young man,...

2
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:43,595
..my father said to me
''Norman, you like to write stories. ''

3
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:46,598
And l said ''Yes, l do. ''

4
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:50,143
Then he said
''Someday, when you're ready,...

5
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:52,938
..you might tell our family story. ''

6
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:56,524
''Only then will you understand
what happened...

7
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:57,901
..and why. ''

8
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:00,904
? <melancholy violin>

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,507
ln our family, there was no clear line
between religion and fly-fishing.

10
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:31,768
We lived at the junction of
great trout rivers in Missoula, Montana,...

11
00:01:31,977 --> 00:01:34,479
..where lndians still appeared
out of the wilderness...

12
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:37,232
..to walk the honky-tonks
and brothels of Front Street.

13
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:18,625
My father was a Presbyterian minister
and a fly-fisherman.

14
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,670
(Reverend) There is one yonder...

15
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,675
And though it is true that one day a week
was given over wholly to religion,...

16
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:31,179
..even then he told us about
Christ's disciples being fishermen.

17
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:35,267
And we were left to assume,
as my younger brother Paul and l did,...

18
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:39,646
..that all first-class fishermen
on the Sea of Galilee were fly-fishermen...

19
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:43,191
..and that John, the favourite,
was a dry fly-fisherman.

20
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:49,072
The poor without Christ
are of all men the most miserable.

21
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,741
But the poor with Christ...

22
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:56,079
..are princes and kings of the earth.

23
00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:01,293
ln the afternoon, we would walk with him
while he unwound between services.

24
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:05,130
He almost always chose a path
along the Big Blackfoot,...

25
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:07,799
..which we considered our family river.

26
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:12,262
And it was there he felt his soul restored
and his imagination stirred.

27
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:16,891
Long ago, rain fell on mud
and became rock.

28
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,145
Half a billion years ago.

29
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:24,316
But even before that, beneath the rocks,...

30
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:29,362
..are the words of God. Listen.

31
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,948
( running water)

32
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:40,540
And if Paul and l listened very carefully
all our lives,...

33
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,585
..we might hear those words.

34
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:53,720
Even so, Paul and l probably received
as many hours' instruction in fly-fishing...

35
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:57,474
..as we did on all other spiritual matters.

36
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:03,813
As a Presbyterian, my father believed
that man by nature was a damned mess,...

37
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:08,360
..and only by picking up God's rhythms
could we regain power and beauty.

38
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,654
Ten...

39
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,408
To him, all good things, trout as well as
eternal salv ation, come by grace.

40
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:20,121
And grace comes by art,
and art does not come easy.

41
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,123
Norman?

42
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,924
So my brother and l learned to cast
Presbyterian style,...

43
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,009
..on a metronome.

44
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,136
( metronome ticks )

45
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:39,307
He began each session
with the same instruction.

46
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:41,017
Casting is an art...

47
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:45,146
..that is performed on a four-count rhythm
between ten o'clock and two o'clock.

48
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:48,858
(ducks quack)

49
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,529
lf he had had his way, nobody
who did not know how to catch a fish...

50
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:56,283
..would be allowed to disgrace a fish
by catching it.

51
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:06,960
So it was
with my formal education as well.

52
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,714
Each weekday, while my father
worked on his Sunday sermon,...

53
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,218
..l attended the school
of the Reverend Maclean.

54
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:17,721
He taught nothing
but reading and writing...

55
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:22,517
..and, being a Scot, believed
that the art of writing lay in thrift.

56
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,071
Half as long.

57
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:38,950
( sighs )

58
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:46,082
So while my friends spent their days
at Missoula Elementary, l stayed home...

59
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:49,711
..and learned to write
the American language.

60
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,097
Again,...

61
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:03,016
..half as long.

62
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:32,879
Good. Now throw it away.

63
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:50,063
(Mother) Norman!

64
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:52,399
Norman!

65
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,526
Wait for your brother!

66
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:05,203
However, there was a balance
to my father's system.

67
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,084
Every afternoon, l was set free,
untutored and untouched till supper,...

68
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:15,297
..to learn on my own
the natural side of God's order.

69
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,186
And there could be no better place
to learn than the Montana of my youth.

70
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:34,274
lt was a world with dew still on it,...

71
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:40,238
..more touched by wonder and possibility
than any l have since known.

72
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:10,477
( men whistle and shout)

73
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,729
(horses whinny)

74
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:17,525
Goddamn it! Open up the door!

75
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,528
- (boys laugh )
- Hey! What the hell is going on?

76
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,658
- Hey, where are you guys going?
- Chicken!

77
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,826
? <jazz>

78
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,123
( women laugh )

79
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,626
Go on, move over.

80
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,184
( women whoop and cheer)

81
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:01,987
(punches thud, man grunts )

82
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,449
But it was a tough world, too.

83
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,952
Even as children we understood that,
and admired it.

84
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,662
( men grunt)

85
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,914
(train whistles )

86
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,959
And of course, we had to test it.

87
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,463
l knew l was tough,
because l'd been bloodied in battle.

88
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,382
Get him! Get him!

89
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,509
You sissy!

90
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:25,802
Come on!

91
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:31,141
Come on! Let's see some blood here!
Go on! Lots of blood!

92
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,809
Go on!

93
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:37,981
Paul was different. His toughness
came from some secret place inside him.

94
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:40,442
He simply knew
he was tougher than anyone alive.

95
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,488
(Reverend) Grace will not be said
until that bowl is clean.

96
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,664
( china crashes )

97
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:04,382
Man has been eating God's oats
for a thousand years.

98
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:09,012
lt's not the place of an eight-year-old boy
to change that tradition.

99
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:22,609
( clock ticks )

100
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,970
( clock strikes )

101
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:52,264
( clears throat)

102
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:13,326
Grace.

103
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,170
Oh, God,...

104
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:28,425
..who art rich in forgiveness,
grant that we may hold fast...

105
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,844
..the good things we receive from Thee.

106
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:32,429
And as often as we fall into sin,...

107
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:34,931
..be lifted by repentence
through Thy grace.

108
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:36,933
Amen.

109
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,731
(Paul) Norm, what do you wanna be
when you grow up?

110
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:45,775
Minister, l guess.

111
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:49,654
Or a professional boxer.

112
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:52,407
You think you could beat Jack Johnson?

113
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,451
l dunno.

114
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:59,581
l think you could. l'd lay a bet on it.

115
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:02,125
What are you gonna be?

116
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:05,170
Professional fly-fisherman.

117
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,881
There's no such thing.

118
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,383
- There isn't?
- No.

119
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:14,429
Hm.

120
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,685
l guess... a boxer.

121
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,854
Not a minister?

122
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,566
(laughs )

123
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:30,528
(both laugh )

124
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:37,452
ln 1 91 7, World War One
came to Missoula,...

125
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:41,498
..taking with it
every able-bodied lumberjack,...

126
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:44,251
..leaving the woods to old men and boys.

127
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:48,880
So at 1 6, l did my duty,...

128
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,549
..and started working
for the US Forest Service.

129
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,097
lt was a life of timber and toil,...

130
00:13:57,597 --> 00:14:00,725
..with the men as tough
as their axe handles...

131
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:06,064
..and more mountains in all directions
than l would ever see again.

132
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:13,321
Too young to join me, Paul took a job as
lifeguard at the municipal swimming pool.

133
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:16,074
During the day,
he could look over the girls,...

134
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:19,369
..and in the evenings he could pursue
his other purpose in life,...

135
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:20,662
..fishing.

136
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,915
( all) ? Be Thou my vision

137
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:27,794
? Oh, Lord of my heart

138
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:35,051
? Nought be all else to me
save that Thou art

139
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:43,059
? Thou my best thought by day or by night

140
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:51,401
? Waking or sleeping
Thy presence my light ?

141
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:59,200
( men whoop and laugh )

142
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:07,918
( whistles )

143
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:29,439
- Preacher, come on! (laughs )
- Please be quiet!

144
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:31,942
- (laughs )
- Shh!

145
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,862
Look at that baby! Preacher!

146
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,615
- Come on!
- Shut up!

147
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:42,827
(they laugh )

148
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,207
(they whoop, yell and laugh )

149
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:50,377
( man whistles tune)

150
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:57,342
Did l tell you what a forest fire sounds like
coming down a mountain at 60mph?

151
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:58,718
Shut up!

152
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:01,554
Damn it, the forest fires!

153
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:05,100
l've got a great idea.
l know how we can go down in history.

154
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:06,268
How's that?

155
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:10,272
We borrow old man Seifert's rowboat
and we shoot the Chutes.

156
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,441
- You can't shoot the Chutes, Pauley.
- You can try.

157
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:14,651
You can die trying.

158
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,279
They'd bury you with full honours.
Tell them, Norm.

159
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:22,450
- Well, we would be the kings of Missoula.
- Yeah, kings! And famous!

160
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,954
And all of you would get
your photographs in the paper.

161
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:27,080
l'm doing it.

162
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,292
- l am.
- You'll die.

163
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,751
No.

164
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,754
(laughs ) Let's do it.

165
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:37,257
- Come on!
- l'm with you!

166
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:40,719
- Let's go!
- (they laugh and whoop)

167
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:43,138
Yeah!

168
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:45,181
All right!

169
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:48,768
? Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream ?

170
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,604
Let's go! Whoo!

171
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,023
- (they laugh )
- Oh!

172
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:54,858
Steady!

173
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:56,693
l'll get the oars.

174
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:01,489
Whose idea was this, anyway?

175
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:04,492
- Come on! This way!
- ( all cheer and shout)

176
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,246
(laughter)

177
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:11,291
? Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream ?

178
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,335
l need a woman!

179
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:15,545
( water rumbles )

180
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,313
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

181
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:39,778
(Paul) OK, we'll put it upstream.

182
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,077
Aagh! OK.

183
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,956
Flip it!

184
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:57,587
OK, hop in.

185
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:04,970
Come on! We can all fit.

186
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:07,305
- l don't think so.
- No, l uh...

187
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,102
Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!

188
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,895
Cluck!

189
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,691
All right. Just me, Norm and Chub.

190
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:20,860
Jeez, Pauley...

191
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:22,571
OK.

192
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,700
Then l guess it's just the Macleans.

193
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:53,727
Be careful!

194
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,487
( whooping )

195
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:09,200
They'll come ashore.

196
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,453
You got it! ( whoops )

197
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,622
Let me tell you something.

198
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:17,334
( whooping )

199
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:29,471
See you later, boys!

200
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:32,057
(laughs )

201
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,437
On the right!

202
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:47,405
On your right! Watch right!

203
00:19:48,156 --> 00:19:50,033
( crash )

204
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,834
(laughs ) Aagh!

205
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,047
Look out!

206
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:18,478
Right!

207
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,732
Watch it! On the right, on the right!

208
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:32,325
Right! Right!

209
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:39,916
Hang on!

210
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:03,106
Oh, jeez.

211
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:09,571
Macleans!

212
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:16,077
Macleans!

213
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:25,837
Pauley!

214
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:27,380
Hey, Chub!

215
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:42,854
Macleans!

216
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:44,564
( shrieks )

217
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,526
What the hell...?

218
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:50,528
Oh!

219
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:52,280
(Paul) Ha, ha!

220
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:57,577
(laughter)

221
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:59,371
Son of a...

222
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,707
Jesus Christ!

223
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:03,750
(laughs )

224
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,127
Crazy son of a bitch!

225
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:11,383
- You guys OK?
- Where's...?

226
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:17,430
Preach, you OK?

227
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:20,141
Sure.

228
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,653
(door creaks open )

229
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:43,790
You will go to church this day
and pray for forgiveness.

230
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:51,798
Your mother spent the night sick with
worry. Did you think of her feelings?

231
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:54,259
(Mother) Mrs Campbell called.

232
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:58,847
Who gave you the boat?

233
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:01,474
- We, um...
- We borrowed it.

234
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,769
Borrowed?

235
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:10,191
Boys, what have you done?

236
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:19,910
Well, you will work off
every cent of its value.

237
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:22,913
Yes, sir.

238
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,415
l'll work it off, Father. lt was my idea.

239
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:39,054
(Paul whistles )

240
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,722
Whoo!

241
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:44,226
What you making?

242
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:45,977
Know what you need on that?

243
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:50,232
- Ham, cheese, sardines. Delicious.
- l hate sardines.

244
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:53,485
l'll show you.
Can you believe those guys?

245
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:57,113
They'll be telling everyone
the class of '1 9 did it.

246
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,199
l should write an article.

247
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:02,160
- ''Macleans Conquer Chutes.''
- l don't like sardines.

248
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:04,746
You could get it in the school paper, l bet.

249
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:09,376
- Chub! (laughs )
- Jeez, Pauley.

250
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:13,380
- What a skeezix!
- l don't want any goddamn sardines!

251
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:22,639
( crockery crashes )

252
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:24,474
(grunting )

253
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:40,907
No! Stop it!

254
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:45,453
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

255
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:50,709
- You hit her, you son of a bitch!
- You knocked her down, you bastard!

256
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:54,421
- Son of a bitch!
- Please, l slipped, l slipped, l slipped!

257
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:06,349
l just slipped, that's all.

258
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,288
That was the only time we ever fought.

259
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:32,000
Perhaps we wondered afterwards
which one of us was tougher.

260
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,837
But if boyhood questions aren't answered
before a certain point,...

261
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:38,131
..they can't be raised again.

262
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:40,967
So we returned
to being gracious to one another,...

263
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:42,677
..as the church wall suggested.

264
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,426
l then saw something remarkable.

265
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:28,974
For the first time, Paul broke free
of our father's instruction...

266
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:31,768
..into a rhythm all his own.

267
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:45,907
OK.

268
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:57,919
OK.

269
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,303
They're both marvellous.

270
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:08,054
(laughs )

271
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:17,564
l'd say the Lord has blessed us all today.

272
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:23,737
(Reverend clears throat)

273
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:30,410
lt's just that he's been
particularly good to me.

274
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:34,247
(laughs )

275
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:36,291
Ah.

276
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:40,879
- (train whistles )
- North Coast! Stops in Helena, Bozeman...

277
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:44,257
The year ended with my acceptance
into Dartmouth College.

278
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:46,176
Sometime before, Father had told me...

279
00:27:46,343 --> 00:27:48,929
..l could attend
any college in the world l could get into.

280
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:51,932
l knew he earned
no more than $1,800 a year,...

281
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:55,810
..so his offer meant more to me
than anything in my life.

282
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:58,313
Well, do your best.

283
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,940
l will.

284
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:02,150
- ( coughs )
- ( conductor) All aboard!

285
00:28:02,317 --> 00:28:05,111
(train creaks into motion )

286
00:28:14,246 --> 00:28:16,206
Hey, Norman! Norm!

287
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:40,480
So, in the autumn of 1 91 9,...

288
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:44,442
..l boarded the Northern Pacific
for a 3,000-mile trip east...

289
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:46,528
..to the unknown.

290
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:54,411
To the son of a Montana minister,
Dartmouth was more than an education.

291
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:58,873
lt was a revelation, exposing me
to a world l'd only guessed at.

292
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:07,299
As part of my degree,...

293
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:11,761
..l had to enlighten incoming freshmen
on the wonders of the Romantic poets.

294
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:16,933
And although l was unaware of it then,
teaching fit me.

295
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:21,062
But most of the time, l sat
in the card room of my fraternity house,...

296
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:24,858
..giving my blue-nosed brothers
a lesson in Front Street poker.

297
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:29,571
ln all, l spent six years at Dartmouth,...

298
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,032
..away from home nearly all that time.

299
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:37,454
On the other hand,
Paul stayed home for college,...

300
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:40,624
..unwilling to leave the fish
he had not yet caught.

301
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:49,883
After graduation, he took a job
as a reporter for a Helena newspaper,...

302
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,135
..and moved to that town,...

303
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:57,015
..his connection with the family
growing as slight as my own.

304
00:29:59,684 --> 00:30:01,561
(train whistles )

305
00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:07,901
lt was not until the spring of 1 9 26...

306
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,695
..that l finally did come home.

307
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,076
Dinner is in half an hour,
so you have time for a bath.

308
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:02,122
Do l look thin, Mother?

309
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,877
Do l look old, Norman?

310
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:12,716
No, you look, uh...

311
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:17,929
l wish Paul could have been here tonight.
He's working late.

312
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,643
Norman?

313
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,936
Won't you come in?

314
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:30,066
( clock strikes )

315
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:34,613
l'm sorry Paul won't be here.

316
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:37,198
The life of a newspaperman.

317
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:41,244
(laughs )
Well, you know how Paul likes to...

318
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:43,079
l do.

319
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:44,956
Sit.

320
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,381
l also hear that he...

321
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,636
Well, l hear everything, don't l?

322
00:31:57,802 --> 00:31:59,846
The Lord forbid
my flock keep me in ignorance.

323
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:01,514
(laughs )

324
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:06,228
Yes.

325
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:10,482
You can bet that everyone from here to
Helena knows all about your education.

326
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,319
lt is an achievement.

327
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:17,072
To what use
shall you put this achievement?

328
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:19,741
( clears throat)

329
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:24,246
Uh... Well, l've been considering
the Forest Service.

330
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:26,706
As a career?

331
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:28,500
No...

332
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:32,921
No, for the summer.

333
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:34,756
Ah!

334
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:36,675
As a break.

335
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:38,927
Well, that's a good idea.

336
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,806
- The body fuels the mind.
- That's what l was thinking.

337
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:45,392
And after?

338
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,269
l'm not absolutely sure yet.

339
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:52,482
Well, you've had six years
to become sure, Norman.

340
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:05,495
Have you considered
an advanced degree?

341
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:10,125
- The law? Medicine?
- No.

342
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,877
The ministry?

343
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,424
l've applied for several teaching positions.

344
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:21,011
- Have you?
- College level, but l haven't heard yet.

345
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:23,305
No, no, it's early, but...

346
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,309
Now, you have taught classes already,
haven't you?

347
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:29,269
Yes.

348
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:32,314
And did you find that experience
rewarding?

349
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,316
That is to say,...

350
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:37,277
..do you feel this could be your calling?

351
00:33:37,444 --> 00:33:39,613
My calling?

352
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,742
(Mother) Dinner, gentlemen!

353
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:59,174
(background chatter)

354
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,009
(laughter) Pee in their pants?

355
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:04,304
lf it's so funny, how come l'm not
laughing? Yes, pee in their pants.

356
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:06,389
(Harry) l got a better story.

357
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:08,308
- Paul Maclean?
- ln there.

358
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:11,603
The rules at Anaconda mines say
''No breaks, not even for the john.''

359
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:14,105
So the poor bastards pee in their pants.

360
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:16,733
- What about the late, uh...
- George Masterson!

361
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,945
- Oh, l'll take that.
- She's 23 and built like a brick shithouse.

362
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,530
- No, no!
- You take the Anaconda thing...

363
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:26,326
- l'll interview the grieving widow.
- But l'm the boss, Maclean!

364
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,954
Fine by me, Boss!

365
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,330
Brother!

366
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,626
Look at you!

367
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:39,673
Boys, this is my big brother,
the professor.

368
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:41,675
- Gentlemen.
- Hiya!

369
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,593
Come on!

370
00:34:44,928 --> 00:34:46,888
Sit.

371
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:49,599
Thanks for coming to see me last night(!)

372
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:52,561
l am sorry about that. l wanted to be there.

373
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:57,148
l wanted to hear the old man say
''Norman, come into my study, please.''

374
00:34:57,357 --> 00:34:59,693
(Norman laughs )

375
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,158
Jeez, the professor!

376
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,372
We should celebrate!

377
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:20,297
Yeah!

378
00:35:22,048 --> 00:35:23,967
A little early for me.

379
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:27,512
Oh! The east is making you soft.

380
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:31,766
ls that right?

381
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,735
( coughs )

382
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:49,910
Do much fishing out east?

383
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:52,787
None.

384
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:54,706
None?

385
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:57,626
Well, what do you say? The Big Blackfoot.

386
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,769
(birdsong )

387
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:26,947
- You set?
- Yeah.

388
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:37,791
- Why don't you take this hole? lt's good.
- No, it's all right.

389
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,043
No, it's a good hole.

390
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:49,052
( reel squeaks )

391
00:37:01,147 --> 00:37:03,650
Too tight. Try a roll-cast.

392
00:37:15,912 --> 00:37:16,955
Ah!

393
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,503
The fish are out further.

394
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:26,548
Just a little... further.

395
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,218
Cast your line into the current.

396
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:33,138
lt'll give you better base,
add some distance.

397
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:36,766
You're just rusty, that's all.

398
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:37,345
He called it shadow-casting,...

399
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:41,558
..keeping his line above water
long enough, and low enough,...

400
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:44,394
..to make a rainbow rise.

401
00:39:45,562 --> 00:39:48,273
And l realised
that in the time l was away,...

402
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,151
..my brother had become an artist.

403
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:57,699
And one day my coach says ''Mac,
how'd you like to meet John L Sullivan?''

404
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:59,492
( all) John L Sullivan?

405
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:02,954
Yes, the John L Sullivan, the last
bare-knuckle champion of the world!

406
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:05,874
lt was then l knew l was home.

407
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:09,502
Standing on the steps
of the Missoula library once again,...

408
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,713
..late at night,...

409
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,468
..telling stories to the same boys who had
sat there and listened 1 00 times before.

410
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:18,637
- lrish or Scot?
- Scot.

411
00:40:18,803 --> 00:40:21,139
And who had, in my absence,
become men.

412
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:24,768
lt just goes to show
the world is full of bastards,...

413
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:29,397
( all) ..the number increasing the further
one gets from Missoula, Montana!

414
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:30,815
- Amen!
- (they whoop)

415
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:33,985
See, Professor, that's why you need
to stick around here from now on.

416
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,904
Hey, where's the gargle?

417
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:38,865
- Yes, pass this way!
- ( whooping )

418
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:41,534
l'll take you to the Fourth of July dance.

419
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:44,996
Every girl you need to know will be there...
without Momma!

420
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:46,915
( all) Ooh!

421
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:49,417
Find you a little Sheba.

422
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:50,752
(laughter)

423
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:52,754
Gentlemen, it's been swell,...

424
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:54,381
..but l have to rush.

425
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:55,548
Where are you going?

426
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:58,468
- Heavy date, Paul?
- Where you going, Pauley?

427
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:01,513
- With the poker table!
- They got new signs on the way down.

428
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,432
''Does your husband misbehave?''

429
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,268
''Grunt 'n' grumble, rant and rave?''

430
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:09,437
''Well, shoot that brute
some Burma-Shave!''

431
00:41:09,604 --> 00:41:12,274
(laughter)

432
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,192
The road to where?

433
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:17,237
- Lolo.
- Lolo Hot Springs.

434
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:19,447
(laughter)

435
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:31,126
Being back in my father's church
seemed to complete my return.

436
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,794
More than anything else,...

437
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:36,506
..l realised it was my father's words
that made me feel most at home.

438
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:39,009
And in the glow of awakened memories,...

439
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:42,637
..with the deepest feelings
of the heart all a-stir,...

440
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:47,225
..we are reminded of the poet who sings.

441
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:52,397
''Backward, turn backward
O time in your flight

442
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:54,566
Make me a child again

443
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:57,235
Just for tonight.''

444
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,280

00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:12,709

- Well, uh...
- Oh, you were gone too long, son!

450
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:49,788
Who's that?

451
00:42:49,955 --> 00:42:51,957
Who?

452
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:53,708
There.

453
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:56,211
( whooping )

454
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:58,004
Oh, yeah?

455
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:03,051
- ( Chub) A little, uh, infatuation?
- (girls laugh )

456
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:05,178
Chub, who is that?

457
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:07,514
Jessie Burns.

458
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:11,560
From Wolf Creek.
She got a brother went to Hollywood.

459
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:14,104
Jessie Burns.

460
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:24,406
Excuse me. Would you like to dance?

461
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:27,701
Would you be a doll and get us a drink?

462
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:30,161
(friend) Jessie, who's that?

463
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:52,267
(band stops playing, applause)

464
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:53,727
Here you are.

465
00:43:53,894 --> 00:43:55,854
(band starts playing )

466
00:43:58,356 --> 00:44:02,777
- Here you go.
- Oh, great. Life-saver!

467
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:06,239
Oops! How ladylike(!)

468
00:44:06,406 --> 00:44:08,366
(giggles )

469
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:12,662
l'll have to be careful.
l'll wipe off all the powder.

470
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:16,124
Phantom Of The Opera! (laughs )

471
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,585

472
00:44:21,379 --> 00:44:23,798

473
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:26,885
? Pack up all my cares and woe

474
00:44:27,052 --> 00:44:29,054

476
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:37,854
You know, l heard, uh, Louis Armstrong
sing, this, uh, song once...

477
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:40,273
..in a little speak
in Greenwich Village, New York.

478
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,275
Really?

479
00:44:42,817 --> 00:44:45,403
Best jazz in the world.
Coloured jazz, you know?

480
00:44:45,612 --> 00:44:47,572
The real McCoy, not like, uh,...

481
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:50,825
..Paul Whiteman
of the Cliquot Club Eskimos.

482
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:54,079
My mother loves
the Cliquot Club Eskimos.

483
00:44:56,831 --> 00:44:58,792
Does she?

484
00:44:59,626 --> 00:45:04,297

487
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:25,318
Yowsa, yowsa, yowsa!

488
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:27,153
Let the fireworks begin!

489
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,114
(booming )

490
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:30,699

( all shout in delight)

494
00:45:39,082 --> 00:45:41,876
(fireworks whistle and boom,
people cheer)

495
00:45:45,422 --> 00:45:47,757
l have a wonderful idea.

496
00:45:47,883 --> 00:45:51,761
What better lesson for those girls
than a trip to the reservation?

497
00:45:51,928 --> 00:45:56,433
To learn a real Christian lesson in giving.
Hm? Don't you think?

498
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,685
l'll organise it. Don't lift a finger.

499
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:03,732
Ah, thank you, Eva. This is the most
charitable idea l've heard in years.

500
00:46:05,275 --> 00:46:08,278
Do you know those lndian children
don't even have shoes, Norman?

501
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:10,530
- Mm?

502
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,617

503
00:46:13,783 --> 00:46:18,538
- OK. lf you need to use it...

504
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:20,540

512
00:46:55,242 --> 00:46:57,077
Thank you.

513
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:01,998

514
00:47:02,415 --> 00:47:04,459
ls Jessie there?

515
00:47:05,418 --> 00:47:09,756
Oh, this is Norman Maclean,
but l don't think she...

516
00:47:12,217 --> 00:47:14,010
Hello.

517
00:47:17,055 --> 00:47:20,267
No, l'm the one who brought you the drink.

518
00:47:21,518 --> 00:47:23,103
Mm-hm.

519
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:28,108
No, we didn't get a chance.
The fireworks started and...

520
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:30,151
Well...

521
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:32,487
We talked about music.

522
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:39,452
And l said l heard
Louis Armstrong sing the...

523
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:43,748
Yeah, that's me.

524
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:46,918
Yeah, l was just a little nervous. Mm?

525
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:48,878
Well, because...

526
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:52,757
..you're so je ne sais quoi.

527
00:47:57,971 --> 00:47:59,723
l thought maybe l could come over...

528
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,893
..and listen to the Cliquot Club Eskimos
with your mother.

529
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:06,688
(laughs ) Yes.

530
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:09,774
Uh-huh.

531
00:48:10,442 --> 00:48:13,820

Mm-hm.

00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:20,660
Well, um, how about Saturday?

00:48:22,287 --> 00:48:24,205
Uh... eight?

535
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:27,792
OK!

536
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:29,753

537
00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:32,130
OK.

538
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:35,300
Then l'll see you then.

539
00:48:36,218 --> 00:48:37,719
Bye.

540
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:50,523
(door opens )

541
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,442
(drunken singing )

542
00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:54,069

543
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,614
(Paul) Hey, here they are!

Shall we?

550
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,474

How are you, Murph?

554
00:49:29,938 --> 00:49:31,815
Long time, long time.

555
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:33,650
Good to see you.

556
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:38,238
Uh, you know the house rules
as good as l do, Paul.

557
00:49:39,406 --> 00:49:41,992
No lnjuns. Period.

558
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,328
l just flat don't like the house rules,
Murph.

559
00:49:45,537 --> 00:49:47,289
Me neither.

560
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:53,837
(laughs ) Well, what are you gonna
make me do here, Pauley?

561
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:57,007
Just get us a table, for four.

562
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:09,686
- Last time, Paul.
- Hello, Judge.

563
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:11,146
(Judge) Paul.

564
00:50:11,313 --> 00:50:15,108
Oh, you can get him back.
Get drunk and dance naked on his tables.

565
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:17,903
And beat hell out of the son of a bitch!

566
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:19,362

567

- My darling!
- Hi, Paul.

568
00:50:30,624 --> 00:50:34,336
They got some swell hooch here.
They even wash the glasses.

569
00:50:48,934 --> 00:50:50,352
(Molly) Drink?

570
00:50:50,518 --> 00:50:52,938
What'll it be, Je... Jessie?

571
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:56,107
Uh, l'll have a martini, Paul. lt is Paul?

572
00:50:56,274 --> 00:50:58,068
(laughs )

573
00:50:58,235 --> 00:51:00,987
Righty-ho! The usual for Norm,...

574
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:02,697
..a gin and prune juice.

575
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:05,116
- Make that a double!
- (Jessie laughs )

576
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:06,993
(Mabel) Excuse me!

577
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,246
l'd like to order a drink, too.

578
00:51:09,454 --> 00:51:11,456
Whisky... double.

579
00:51:17,587 --> 00:51:20,799
So, uh... what are you doing now, Mabel?

580
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:23,969
l sell bait.

581
00:51:27,514 --> 00:51:30,183
You know, you have
the most beautiful hair l've ever seen.

582
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:37,482
- You think l should get it bobbed?
- No, no, not in a million years.

583
00:51:41,736 --> 00:51:43,029
Ah!

584
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:46,741
- Well...
- The candle burns at both ends.

585
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,785
lt will not last the night.

586
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:53,540
But, ah, my foes, and oh, my friends,
it gives a lovely light.

587
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:58,253
That's... nice.

588
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:06,928
( chatter, jazz trumpet)

589
00:52:12,475 --> 00:52:16,271
How about ''To my editor, the old fa...
the old curmudgeon.'' Excuse me.

590
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:18,690
You know,
he took me off the Anaconda story.

591
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:20,775
l'm a reporter at the Bee.

592
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,527
- l know.
- How do you know?

593
00:52:22,694 --> 00:52:24,279
Oh, l'm famous.

594
00:52:24,446 --> 00:52:26,072
The Fishing Newspaperman.

595
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,825
- You know he fishes, too?
- l thought everybody knew.

596
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:31,202
Brother, you've been away a long time.

597
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:33,121
l'd say so.

598
00:52:33,288 --> 00:52:35,957
- Anyway, it seems my editor...
- The old curmudgeon!

599
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:40,629
Yes, exactly. Has been getting calls.
No names, just threats.

600
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:42,464
Real threats?

601
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:46,176
Well, it's nice to know
you're touching a nerve, but...

602
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:49,304
- Well, what did they say?
- Mm?

603
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,723
- What did they say?
- Mm?

604
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,976
- What did they say?
- You'll have to cut it out of him.

605
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:56,811
The usual.

606
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:59,940
( as gangster) ''The boys are gonna have
to come down and pay me a little visit.''

607
00:53:00,106 --> 00:53:02,943
Ah! ''Fit you with a pair of
concrete galoshes, see?''

608
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:04,945
(Paul) Exactly.

609
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:08,573

What did he do?

646
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:05,602
He hit a guy
and a guy is missing a couple of teeth.

647
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:06,728
Why did he hit him?

648
00:57:06,937 --> 00:57:08,605
(door opens )

649
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:10,941
lt says here a remark was passed...

650
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:13,944
..concerning
the lndian woman he was with.

651
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,071
Well, the guy deserved it.

652
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:20,158
You're picking your brother up too much
lately.

653
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:25,455
ls that right?

654
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:28,333
Besides, he's behind
in the big stud poker game at Lolo.

655
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,711
lt's not healthy to get behind
in that big game at Lolo.

656
00:57:34,923 --> 00:57:38,051
- ls he hurt?
- He's not hurt, he's just sick.

657
00:57:38,218 --> 00:57:40,470
He drinks too much.

658
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:43,807
Down at Lolo, they don't drink too much.

659
00:57:49,938 --> 00:57:52,649
You better go in and get your brother.

660
00:58:04,244 --> 00:58:06,204
(gate slams )

661
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:11,751
(faint drunken singing )

662
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:15,422
(guard coughs )

663
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,973
(drunken singing continues )

664
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:30,854
? l'm tired and l wanna go to jail

665
00:58:31,938 --> 00:58:35,567
? l just had a drink about an hour ago

666
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:38,820
? lt went right through my head

667
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:42,157
? No matter where l go...

668
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:43,283
(gate slams )

669
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:45,994
? On land, or sea, or foam

670
00:58:46,161 --> 00:58:50,415
? You can always hear me
singing this song

671
00:58:51,249 --> 00:58:54,252
? Show me the way to go home ?

672
00:58:59,049 --> 00:59:01,134
(drunken man coughs )

673
00:59:21,488 --> 00:59:23,573
( she moans softly)

674
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:55,230
lf you need any money, Paul,
or anything else,...

675
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,359
- ..l want you to know that...
- She lives past the slaughterhouse.

676
01:00:01,486 --> 01:00:02,988
( sighs )

677
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,032
l can help.

678
01:00:09,494 --> 01:00:11,454
(Paul) Turn here.

679
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,969
? <fiddle and banjo play jaunty tune>

680
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,183
(gunshot)

681
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,686
(laughter)

682
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:41,151
(girl) Come here, Queenie, come here!

683
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:46,406
l got it! Whoo, whoo, whoo!

684
01:01:06,843 --> 01:01:08,720
( Al) Look at that! Ha!

685
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:13,058
Well, the chickens haven't
come home to roost yet, Al.

686
01:01:17,812 --> 01:01:19,356
( men cheer)

687
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:21,066
Not bad.

688
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:26,321
- Are you all right, Norman?
- Clara.

689
01:01:26,488 --> 01:01:29,282
- Was that your jelly?
- Yes, it was, Ethel.

690
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:30,367
- lt's wonderful.
- Thank you so much.

691
01:01:30,575 --> 01:01:32,744
- And is this Norman?
- Yes, it is.

692
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:34,996
Yes, we're very proud of him.

693
01:01:35,163 --> 01:01:37,582
- Nice to have you back.
- Thank you.

694
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:40,544
Her daughter has turned
into quite a beauty.

695
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:43,588
And there she is over there.
Twenty only a week ago.

696
01:01:43,755 --> 01:01:45,590
She's bright as a light, Norman.

697
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:47,801
Mother...

698
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:50,679
Mr Murchison! How are you?

699
01:01:52,305 --> 01:01:54,182
(loudly) How are you?

700
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:57,352
- How are you?
- Oh, quite well, thank you.

701
01:01:57,519 --> 01:01:59,312
Good, good.

702
01:01:59,479 --> 01:02:01,565
And this is Paul?

703
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,525
No, this is Norman.

704
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:06,987
- ( shouts ) Norman.
- Oh, Norman!

705
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:10,907
- You're looking good.
- Yes, hasn't he grown up?

706
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:15,412
- You're looking so good.
- Oh, Paul's here. Come on!

707
01:02:16,121 --> 01:02:19,499
l'm sorry, Mother. l have to meet
Jessie Burns' family at the station.

708
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,084
Her brother Neal's coming from California.

709
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:23,169
Oh, well now.

710
01:02:23,336 --> 01:02:26,631
- So l'm late.
- Should we have this girl over to dinner?

711
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,009
Perhaps, Mother.

712
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,442
- Hello!
- Howdy!

713
01:02:45,609 --> 01:02:46,610
Mother!

714
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:49,070
( she squeals )

715
01:02:49,237 --> 01:02:51,197
( she laughs )

716
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:54,200
( she giggles )

717
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:56,328
- Paul!
- Well, well...

718
01:02:56,494 --> 01:02:57,996
Hey, Maclean!

719
01:02:58,163 --> 01:02:59,205
- Paul.
- Maclean.

720
01:02:59,414 --> 01:03:02,209
- Let me borrow those a moment.
- Sure, why not?

721
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:03,254
Hello, Father.

722
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:07,007
- (dogs bark)
- ( woman ) Come here, come here!

723
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,680
(bagpipes play, men cheer)

724
01:03:21,313 --> 01:03:23,566
( chatter)

725
01:03:23,774 --> 01:03:25,860
- ( woman ) Yes, you are!
- ( man ) No!

726
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:29,989
The Burns family ran a general store
in a one-store town...

727
01:03:30,156 --> 01:03:32,867
..and still managed to do badly.

728
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,703
This is Norman.

729
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:37,163
They were Methodists,...

730
01:03:37,371 --> 01:03:41,500
..a denomination my father always
referred to as ''Baptists who could read''.

731
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:45,129
- Glad to know you. lt's a pleasure.
- (Jessie) This is my mother.

732
01:03:45,296 --> 01:03:48,215
lt's a pleasure to meet you, Norman.
Jessie tells me you're a poet.

733
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:50,217
Are you related
to the Fishing Newspaperman?

734
01:03:50,384 --> 01:03:51,761
That's my brother.

735
01:03:51,927 --> 01:03:54,513
- Jessie says you just got your degree.
- Yes.

736
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,016
Jessie was at the university.
She was majoring in...

737
01:03:57,224 --> 01:03:58,142
Flapperism.

738
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:01,353
- (they laugh )
- Wasn't it?

739
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,607
- She dropped out.
- (Jessie) Aunt Sally!

740
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,859
She can learn from you. Stick-to-activity.

741
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:09,695
Oh, now, just let the young man breathe.

742
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:11,947
He's not used to all this.
He's a Presbyterian.

743
01:04:12,156 --> 01:04:13,741
( all laugh )

744
01:04:13,908 --> 01:04:14,950
(train whistles )

745
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:18,245
Ooh, he's here! He's here!

746
01:04:18,412 --> 01:04:21,082
( chatter)

747
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,877
(brakes squeal)

748
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:33,260
(laughs )

749
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:37,223
Jessie's brother Neal
stepped off the train...

750
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:40,017
..trying to remember what
a Davis Cup tennis player looked like.

751
01:04:40,184 --> 01:04:43,813
- You look so good!
- He looks a little thin!

752
01:04:43,979 --> 01:04:47,274
You look great! You look great!

753
01:04:47,441 --> 01:04:50,277
Neal, this is Norman.
Norman, my brother Neal.

754
01:04:50,444 --> 01:04:52,863
Hello, boy.

755
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:55,366
What, did you sit up all night
on that thing?

756
01:04:55,574 --> 01:04:57,743
Did you get my card from Yellowstone?

757
01:04:57,952 --> 01:04:59,829
- l did. l got that.
- What do you think about this tie?

758
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:02,790
Come on, guys. Let him breathe.
He just got here.

759
01:05:02,957 --> 01:05:05,042
- Let's go eat.
- That's a good idea!

760
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:07,253
l got some chicken salad sandwiches
in the car,....

761
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,922
..and l've got some baking chickens
at home.

762
01:05:10,131 --> 01:05:13,259
Mrs Miller has given us some cherries
so l can make your favourite pie.

763
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:16,345
(Neal) Mrs Miller's still alive?

764
01:05:17,138 --> 01:05:18,055
( whooping )

765
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:20,141
Not the home-made beer!

766
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:22,393
lt was a good year!

767
01:05:22,893 --> 01:05:27,648
Over the lips, past the gums,
look out stomach, here she comes!

768
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,150
(glasses chink)

769
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,318
So what's the first station out there now?

770
01:05:31,485 --> 01:05:35,364
When l travelled that way,
San Berdoo was there.

771
01:05:35,573 --> 01:05:39,118
San Berdoo and a lot of sand,
and a lot of desert,...

772
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:40,995
..a hell of a lot of desert.

773
01:05:41,162 --> 01:05:43,497
We came back to Salt Lake City,...

774
01:05:43,664 --> 01:05:46,667
..and had to change at Salt Lake City.

775
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:49,545
There was a little hotel there
that used to...

776
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:53,007
- (Neal) Serve oysters.
- (Mr Burns ) ..serve oysters.

777
01:05:53,174 --> 01:05:57,053
- Norman, do you drink? Does he drink?
- Oh, a little bit.

778
01:05:57,261 --> 01:06:00,056
Well, here's to the old fam-damn-ily!

779
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,141
(Jessie) Fam-damn-ily!

780
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:04,560
- (Mr Burns ) Hear, hear!
- ( all) Fam-damn-ily.

781
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:06,854
( all murmur and chatter)

782
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:10,191
(Jessie) He's just tired. lt's a long trip.

783
01:06:10,357 --> 01:06:13,360
(Mrs Burns )
At least he still has his appetite!

784
01:06:14,653 --> 01:06:16,280
(Jessie laughs )

785
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,037
So how long you planning to stay, Neal?

786
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,832
Sport! Sport, come here!

787
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:28,459
(dog pants )

788
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:32,004
(laughs ) l don't know. l miss the ocean.

789
01:06:32,213 --> 01:06:34,006
What's it like?

790
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:37,218
Oh, it's big and it's blue.
People ride on the waves.

791
01:06:37,385 --> 01:06:40,596
l tell you, l was getting pretty good at it!
Ow!

792
01:06:40,805 --> 01:06:43,224
Down, man! Bad dog, bad!

793
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:47,645
- Jeez, Ma!
- Well, you get him so excited!

794
01:06:47,853 --> 01:06:49,146
Sport!

795
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:52,316
Anyhoo, what was l...
What was l talking about?

796
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:53,776
- The water.
- The ocean.

797
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,736
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

798
01:06:55,903 --> 01:06:57,947
So we'd ride those waves all day long,
all the boys,...

799
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,533
..Ramon, me, Ronnie Coleman.

800
01:07:00,741 --> 01:07:02,284
Ronald Coleman?!

801
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:05,746
- Ronald Coleman?
- l love Ronald Coleman.

802
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:09,500
You know, people have told me
l look like Ronald Coleman.

803
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:14,380
- Yeah.
- l can't picture him riding on waves.

804
01:07:14,547 --> 01:07:18,509
( all laugh )

805
01:07:20,594 --> 01:07:22,763
Some Kodak, huh?

806
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:26,475
Well, Ma,...

807
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:28,436
..it's been a long trip.

808
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,273
( men talk in background)

809
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,651
Maybe you could go fishing
with Norman sometime?

810
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,488
- Hm?
- (Jessie) Yeah, that's a good idea.

811
01:07:43,284 --> 01:07:44,326
Yeah.

812
01:07:44,535 --> 01:07:46,787
Wonderful. Wouldn't it be?

813
01:07:46,954 --> 01:07:48,164
Fishing?

814
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,999
Well, you do fish?

815
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,377
(ladies ) Course he does!
He has a pole and everything.

816
01:07:53,544 --> 01:07:54,754
Oh, yes, everybody does.

817
01:07:54,962 --> 01:07:56,630
You betcha!

818
01:07:56,797 --> 01:08:00,593
- When's a good time for you, Norman?
- Oh, uh, Friday?

819
01:08:00,801 --> 01:08:01,844
Friday's good.

820
01:08:02,053 --> 01:08:04,555
- ( Aunt Sally) Friday's good.
- What time?

821
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,058
Six?

822
01:08:07,224 --> 01:08:08,642
AM?

823
01:08:08,809 --> 01:08:11,896
(they laugh )

824
01:08:12,063 --> 01:08:15,608
Oh, yes. He'll be there. Won't you, honey?

825
01:08:15,775 --> 01:08:18,569
Thank you, Norman,
that's very kind of you.

826
01:08:18,736 --> 01:08:19,653
Oh, my pleasure.

827
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,655
And... and maybe Paul could come, too?

828
01:08:21,822 --> 01:08:24,241
(Mrs Burns ) Oh, that would be nice.

829
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:27,328
l'm sure Paul would love
to go fishing with us.

830
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:31,665
- Can l come?
- Oh, no, not this time, honey.

831
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:37,046
- Let's get these things outside.
- ( chatter)

832
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:47,431
- Why don't you go with Neal, Norman?
- Hm?

833
01:08:47,598 --> 01:08:49,266
So you can make your plans.

834
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:52,311
Oh,... yeah.

835
01:08:52,478 --> 01:08:54,355
( clears throat)

836
01:08:54,522 --> 01:08:56,774
(ladies laugh in background)

837
01:08:56,982 --> 01:09:00,861
The only plan Neal had in mind
was a trip to Black Jack's Bar,...

838
01:09:01,028 --> 01:09:03,823
..which was simply an old freight car
set in the woods,...

839
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:06,242
..where any honest policeman
would be unlikely to find it.

840
01:09:07,868 --> 01:09:10,871
So, it was this otter and her pups.

841
01:09:11,038 --> 01:09:15,376
Now, l had a hell of a time tracking 'em,
because they turn white in the winter.

842
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:19,547
After a few shots of the especially vile
whisky brewed by Black Jack himself,...

843
01:09:19,714 --> 01:09:21,799
..Neal began to hold forth.

844
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:26,595
He'd chosen Montana subjects to spin
his lies about shooting, hiking, trapping,...

845
01:09:26,804 --> 01:09:29,932
..probably, l figure, to impress
the only other client at the bar,...

846
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:32,643
..a ploy that was beginning to pay off.

847
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:37,398
Anyhoo, she tried to lose me
again and again,...

848
01:09:37,565 --> 01:09:39,984
She went by the name of Old Rawhide.

849
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:44,238
About ten years before, she'd been
elected beauty queen of Wolf Creek.

850
01:09:44,405 --> 01:09:48,909
She had ridden bareback standing up
through the 1 00 inhabitants, mostly male.

851
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:53,622
Her skirts flew high,
and she won the contest.

852
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:57,960
l couldn't feel my hands! l'm thinking
about my dog, Sport, that's with me.

853
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,171
l'm thinking ''lf it gets any colder,...

854
01:10:00,337 --> 01:10:03,966
.. l just may have to slit him open and stick
my hands in to keep 'em from freezing.''

855
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,177
lt would have been a tough thing to do.

856
01:10:06,343 --> 01:10:09,889
But l... Well, l did it before,
up at the Yukon.

857
01:10:10,056 --> 01:10:12,224
God knows, l love that damn dog.

858
01:10:12,433 --> 01:10:15,227
She still wore the divided skirts
of a horsewoman,...

859
01:10:15,394 --> 01:10:17,980
..although they must have been
a hardship in her new profession.

860
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,733
And there, on a branch,...

861
01:10:20,941 --> 01:10:22,902
..waiting to jump on the first deer,...

862
01:10:23,069 --> 01:10:26,697
..is the goddamn otter! (laughs )

863
01:10:26,906 --> 01:10:28,949
Hey, buster,...

864
01:10:29,116 --> 01:10:32,745
..what's an otter doing
on the top of Rogers Pass?

865
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:35,873
l thought they swam down in the cricks.

866
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:41,420
Jack, why don't you bring this lady
a whisky?

867
01:10:41,587 --> 01:10:43,631
Well, l gotta shove off.

868
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:47,927
Don't forget, old boy. Friday, fishing.

869
01:10:49,303 --> 01:10:50,596
What?

870
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,570
( chatter)

871
01:11:18,999 --> 01:11:20,376
(Paul) What say?

872
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:22,545
They said l'd find you at your other office.

873
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:25,798
Yeah. Deadline. l can't work there.

874
01:11:25,965 --> 01:11:27,842
Hm.

875
01:11:29,176 --> 01:11:30,553
You come for a drink?

876
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,432
Um,... a favour.

877
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,435
Uh-oh.

878
01:11:40,813 --> 01:11:42,773
Go fishing with me?

879
01:11:44,775 --> 01:11:48,237
(laughs ) Sure.

880
01:11:49,655 --> 01:11:55,202
Well, that's marvy, because Jessie's got
a brother in from California, and, um...

881
01:11:55,369 --> 01:11:56,245
Oh.

882
01:11:56,454 --> 01:11:59,331
l'm not gonna lie to you:
he's a world champion peckerwood.

883
01:11:59,498 --> 01:12:02,084
- Bait fisherman?
- He didn't say.

884
01:12:02,293 --> 01:12:04,628
Good Lord! George!

885
01:12:04,837 --> 01:12:07,715
He's going to show up
with a coffee can full of worms.

886
01:12:07,882 --> 01:12:10,468
Red can. Hills Brothers. l'd lay a bet on it.

887
01:12:12,178 --> 01:12:14,430
( sighs ) l promised Jessie.

888
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,061
Are you getting serious?

889
01:12:20,227 --> 01:12:21,353
What?

890
01:12:21,562 --> 01:12:25,733
You son of a bitch, you're getting
serious. You and Jessie. Huh?

891
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,405
- Well?
- l don't know.

892
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,575
(laughs )

893
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:37,870
Then l guess we ought to do it.

894
01:12:52,676 --> 01:12:55,012
( car horn and engine)

895
01:13:04,855 --> 01:13:07,900
- ( car horn )
- Whoa! Whoa!

896
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:10,861
Hi.

897
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:16,242
(Paul) As l live and breathe.

898
01:13:16,409 --> 01:13:18,494
Buster here wants to fish.

899
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,713
You're late, Neal.

900
01:13:30,464 --> 01:13:33,050
Yeah, l, uh, didn't get in till late.

901
01:13:33,217 --> 01:13:36,345
Well, l didn't get in at all, but l was here.

902
01:13:36,554 --> 01:13:38,514
(Norman ) Neal, Paul. Paul, Neal.

903
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,976
Neal, in Montana there are three things
we're never late for:

904
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,687
..church, work, and fishing.

905
01:13:44,895 --> 01:13:46,188
Righty-ho.

906
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:49,150
Anyhoo, this is...

907
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,110
(both ) We've met.

908
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:57,199
Don't go away.

909
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,870
(thud)

910
01:14:08,002 --> 01:14:11,380
Watch the first step - it's a lulu.

911
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:24,018
- So...
- You ready to... Neal?

912
01:14:26,187 --> 01:14:28,230
- Neal!
- What?

913
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,232
Fishing.

914
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:39,366
Buster wants to fish.

915
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,666
Oh, Neal? What about the bait?

916
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,796
( sighs ) Dumb Dora!

917
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:08,020
We're not gonna catch anything, anyway.
lt's too damn hot.

918
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:10,564
( mutters ) May he get three doses of clap.

919
01:15:11,065 --> 01:15:13,651
Sure glad l didn't go home
and get some sleep!

920
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:16,237
(Paul groans )

921
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,699
Where is he?

922
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,287
God!

923
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:31,252
We'll catch up.

924
01:15:31,419 --> 01:15:33,045
Yeah.

925
01:16:03,409 --> 01:16:05,327
l know, you've got twenty.

926
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,048
Couldn't you find him?

927
01:16:17,214 --> 01:16:21,719
- To hell with him.
- l thought we were supposed to help him.

928
01:16:21,886 --> 01:16:24,472
How the hell do you help
that son of a bitch?

929
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:29,060
By taking him fishing.

930
01:16:29,226 --> 01:16:32,063
( scoffs ) He doesn't like fishing.

931
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:34,732
He doesn't like Montana,
and he sure as hell doesn't like me!

932
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:36,776
(laughs )

933
01:16:36,942 --> 01:16:41,947
Well, maybe what he likes
is somebody trying to help him.

934
01:16:57,797 --> 01:16:59,799
You... You sank the beer, yeah?

935
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:01,926
You bet your life.

936
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,679
(laughs ) Yeah.

937
01:17:05,846 --> 01:17:07,932
OK, let's go!

938
01:17:15,272 --> 01:17:17,608
(Paul) Oh, jeez! l can taste it!

939
01:17:21,278 --> 01:17:23,239
(flies buzz )

940
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:26,242
Shall we kill him?

941
01:17:32,373 --> 01:17:34,709
- Damn it!
- (glass clunks )

942
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:37,086
Holy Christ!

943
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,685
(Norman ) This is not good.

944
01:17:52,852 --> 01:17:56,147
(laughs ) Well, she's got a tattoo.

945
01:17:56,313 --> 01:17:58,357
Well.

946
01:17:58,524 --> 01:18:00,943
- lnitials?
- No.

947
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,028
Love.

948
01:18:03,195 --> 01:18:06,824
(both laugh )

949
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:10,411
(Neal groans )

950
01:18:10,578 --> 01:18:12,663
(Rawhide) l can get in myself.

951
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:14,749
(Neal grunts )

952
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,252
( winces ) Ah!

953
01:18:18,419 --> 01:18:21,547
Hey, you got anything to drink, buster?

954
01:18:21,714 --> 01:18:23,966
Uh, Buster's the one with the red ass.

955
01:18:33,017 --> 01:18:35,603
- (Neal grunts )
- (door clunks )

956
01:18:36,437 --> 01:18:38,397
l'm in deep trouble.

957
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:41,567
Yeah. You want me
to come over and protect you?

958
01:18:41,734 --> 01:18:43,986
l'm sure Mrs Burns
would love to meet the girlfriend.

959
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:46,238
l ain't burned!

960
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:48,616
The sun don't bother me!

961
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,411
Yeah.

962
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:56,791
What do you think about me spending
the night with you and the folks?

963
01:18:56,999 --> 01:19:00,127
We'll come back here tomorrow,
wipe this day off the books.

964
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:02,129
lt's a deal.

965
01:19:02,296 --> 01:19:06,092
Come on, buster! l'm as dry as dirt.

966
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,219
Hark, fair Juliet speaks.

967
01:19:12,098 --> 01:19:14,767
- Good luck!
- ( car engine starts )

968
01:19:29,657 --> 01:19:31,617
(Neal winces )

969
01:19:31,784 --> 01:19:33,411
Ow!

970
01:19:33,577 --> 01:19:35,496
(Neal) Ow! Aagh!

971
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:41,335
Sweet Jesus!

972
01:19:41,502 --> 01:19:43,921
What have you done to my boy?

973
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:46,716
Don't... Aagh!

974
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,385
- What...?
- He fell asleep in the sun.

975
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:51,470
( clears throat)

976
01:19:52,805 --> 01:19:54,014
(Neal winces )

977
01:19:54,181 --> 01:19:57,643
Oh, my Lord in heaven! lt's all right.

978
01:19:57,852 --> 01:19:59,812
lt's all right, we'll fix it.

979
01:19:59,979 --> 01:20:01,981
- We'll fix it.
- ( winces )

980
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:10,072
You left him alone, Norman?

981
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,408
He was... He brought someone,...

982
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,410
..and, uh...

983
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:16,620
l think you better go home.

984
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,500
(dog barks )

985
01:20:25,588 --> 01:20:27,840
( cock crows )

986
01:20:32,053 --> 01:20:33,179
( raps on door)

987
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,724
l need a ride home.

988
01:21:04,543 --> 01:21:06,879
- (gears crunch )
- You better hang on!

989
01:21:07,046 --> 01:21:08,422
What are you do...?

990
01:21:14,178 --> 01:21:16,263
(gears crunch )

991
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,826
l don't think you, uh...

992
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:41,205
They send trains down here all the time,
you know, without a schedule.

993
01:21:42,581 --> 01:21:44,834
You're not, uh...

994
01:21:47,253 --> 01:21:49,213
( echoing ) l don't think
they can see us in here.

995
01:22:57,656 --> 01:22:59,325
( sighs )

996
01:22:59,617 --> 01:23:02,119
Well, thanks for the flight.

997
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:08,042
You know, you're funny.

998
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:10,628
Oh? How am l funny?

999
01:23:12,046 --> 01:23:15,341
You, uh...
You don't like my brother, do you?

1000
01:23:20,221 --> 01:23:22,640
No, l do not like your brother.

1001
01:23:26,477 --> 01:23:28,813
Look, l don't know any card tricks, Jess,...

1002
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:30,940
..but l like you.

1003
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:33,526
And l wanna see you again.

1004
01:23:41,409 --> 01:23:43,744
- ( car horn )
- Hey!

1005
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:47,498
- Hello, Jess.
- Hey, Paul.

1006
01:23:47,707 --> 01:23:51,585
- How's your brother?
- You, uh... You both left him alone.

1007
01:23:51,752 --> 01:23:54,171
Well, l'm sorry about that.
That was my fault.

1008
01:23:54,338 --> 01:23:56,674
Well, you're not forgiven.

1009
01:23:57,216 --> 01:23:59,385
Was Norman forgiven?

1010
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:02,054
Norman's not funny.

1011
01:24:05,224 --> 01:24:08,018
(laughs ) Whoo!

1012
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,816
(laughs )

1013
01:24:17,278 --> 01:24:19,780
And l hung fresh towels
on the washstand for you.

1014
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:22,324
Won't you remember
to powder my toothbrush, Mother?

1015
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:23,993
Oh!

1016
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,912
Now let Paul tell his latest story.

1017
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:30,207
Oh, yes, which one?
The murder, the wreck or the fire?

1018
01:24:30,374 --> 01:24:33,127
l think they should put you
on church beat.

1019
01:24:33,294 --> 01:24:35,087
l agree, l agree.

1020
01:24:35,254 --> 01:24:39,300
Quote: ''The Reverend Maclean had quite
a nice roast while dining with his family.''

1021
01:24:39,467 --> 01:24:42,511
''All except for the poor elder son...

1022
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,680
..enjoyed it immensely.''

1023
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:48,100
- Norman, what's the matter?
- He's not funny.

1024
01:24:48,309 --> 01:24:50,811
- Pardon me?
- ( whispers ) He's not funny.

1025
01:24:50,978 --> 01:24:52,730
(laughs )

1026
01:24:52,897 --> 01:24:56,609
Uh, well, there are more important
accomplishments, Norman.

1027
01:24:56,817 --> 01:24:58,486
Mm-hm. lt's all right if you're dull, Norman.

1028
01:24:58,652 --> 01:25:00,821
(Mother) No!

1029
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:02,865
We're very proud of you.

1030
01:25:03,991 --> 01:25:06,577
- (laughs quietly)
- Well, l do have one story.

1031
01:25:06,786 --> 01:25:07,995
No murder, no mayhem.

1032
01:25:08,162 --> 01:25:11,290
l interviewed the President.

1033
01:25:13,918 --> 01:25:15,961
- Calvin Coolidge?
- (Mother) The President?

1034
01:25:16,128 --> 01:25:18,631
- Mr Coolidge?
- Uh-huh.

1035
01:25:18,839 --> 01:25:19,965
- When?
- A few days ago.

1036
01:25:20,174 --> 01:25:21,884
He was in Dakota,... fly-fishing.

1037
01:25:22,051 --> 01:25:23,886
Fly-fishing!

1038
01:25:24,053 --> 01:25:27,098
Fly-fishing in a suit and tie,
white gloves and patent leather shoes.

1039
01:25:27,264 --> 01:25:30,643
- (laughs )
- So l asked him. l went right up to him.

1040
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:34,438
l said ''Excuse me, sir,
can you tell me what they're biting on?''

1041
01:25:34,605 --> 01:25:37,316
He turns around, looks at me,
and says ''The end of my line.''

1042
01:25:37,483 --> 01:25:40,069
- (Mother) What?
- The end of my line.

1043
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:42,405
( men laugh )

1044
01:25:42,613 --> 01:25:45,032
Then a bunch of the locals
came running over,...

1045
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,952
..tied on some new-fangled fly
the size of a chicken.

1046
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:50,204
Old Cal, he heaves it out there.

1047
01:25:50,413 --> 01:25:53,874
Figured if he can't catch a trout,
by God, he's gonna scare one to death.

1048
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:56,127
( all laugh )

1049
01:25:57,712 --> 01:25:59,255
Did you get a picture?

1050
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:01,465
Oh, yeah. lt'll be in the Sunday paper.

1051
01:26:01,632 --> 01:26:03,884
''Closed Mouth Cal
Communes With The Croppies.''

1052
01:26:04,051 --> 01:26:05,511
(laughs )

1053
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,348
Ugh!

1054
01:26:09,515 --> 01:26:10,933
( sucks in breath )

1055
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,935
( sighs contentedly)

1056
01:26:13,102 --> 01:26:15,062
Mother, that was amazing.

1057
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:17,732
Yeah, he usually only eats
what he can hit on the road.

1058
01:26:17,898 --> 01:26:19,984
That was funny.

1059
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:24,321
- You know, l do worry about you, Paul.
- l think l'm gonna run over and... Hm?

1060
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:27,825
- What?
- What?

1061
01:26:29,744 --> 01:26:33,039
Oh, l was just gonna say,...

1062
01:26:33,247 --> 01:26:37,418
..l thought l'd go out and meet some
of the old pals, being in town and all.

1063
01:26:41,297 --> 01:26:45,468
Don't you wait up. l'm planning on eating
the rest of this when nobody's looking.

1064
01:26:52,892 --> 01:26:54,685
(door closes )

1065
01:27:16,707 --> 01:27:20,961
l understand he's changed
the spelling of our name.

1066
01:27:22,213 --> 01:27:24,715
''MacLean'', with a capital L.

1067
01:27:25,716 --> 01:27:29,512
(tuts ) Now everyone will think
we're Lowland Scots.

1068
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,113
Howdy, Norman.

1069
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,450
Hi, there, Mr Sweeney.

1070
01:27:51,617 --> 01:27:55,246
Who do you know
at the University of Chicago?

1071
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,960
Chicken in the car. The car won't go.

1072
01:28:01,127 --> 01:28:04,088
That's how you spell ''Chi-ca-go''!
(laughs )

1073
01:28:16,559 --> 01:28:22,356
(Reverend Maclean ) ''Hath elsewhere
it's setting, and cometh from afar:

1074
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:26,902
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness,

1075
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:31,824
But trailing clouds of glory do we come

1076
01:28:31,991 --> 01:28:33,200
From God, who is our home.''

1077
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:36,454
(joins in ) Nothing can bring back
the hour of splendour in the grass

1078
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:39,623
Of glory in the flower;
We will grieve not

1079
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:43,919
Rather find strength
in what remains behind;

1080
01:28:44,086 --> 01:28:47,631
ln the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be;

1081
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,885
ln the soothing thoughts
that spring out of human suffering;

1082
01:28:51,052 --> 01:28:53,763
ln the faith that looks through death

1083
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:57,475
Thanks to the human heart
by which we live

1084
01:28:57,683 --> 01:29:01,145
Thanks to its tenderness,
its joys, its fears.

1085
01:29:02,605 --> 01:29:05,983
To me, the meanest flower that blows

1086
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:11,530
(both ) Can give thoughts
that do often lie too deep for tears.

1087
01:29:16,702 --> 01:29:19,372
Good luck, Son. We'll be rooting for you.

1088
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:20,456
There's sandwiches in here for you.

1089
01:29:20,664 --> 01:29:24,293
lt was one week ex actly
before l spoke to Jessie again.

1090
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:27,463
She called to tell me
that Neal was going back to California,...

1091
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:30,049
..and that he would appreciate me
seeing him off.

1092
01:29:30,216 --> 01:29:32,301
We love you, we love you. Good luck.

1093
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,265
Though l was surprised by the invitation,
l asked only one question of Jessie.

1094
01:29:38,474 --> 01:29:41,477
Did she want me to come?
And she answered yes.

1095
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:44,397
l love you. Don't forget to write!

1096
01:30:24,812 --> 01:30:28,190
(Jessie) lf he came back next summer,
would you try and help him?

1097
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:30,735
lf he wanted me to, l would try.

1098
01:30:31,235 --> 01:30:35,364
- Well, he's not coming back.
- At least he's got friends out there.

1099
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:38,242
Who, Ronald Coleman?

1100
01:30:43,581 --> 01:30:45,249
( she sighs )

1101
01:30:47,918 --> 01:30:51,881
Why is it
the people who need the most help...

1102
01:30:52,089 --> 01:30:53,549
..won't take it?

1103
01:30:55,843 --> 01:30:57,887
l don't know, Jess.

1104
01:31:03,392 --> 01:31:05,436
( sighs ) God.

1105
01:31:05,603 --> 01:31:07,271
l don't...

1106
01:31:07,438 --> 01:31:09,523
l don't cry, Norman.

1107
01:31:15,905 --> 01:31:17,698
( sniffs )

1108
01:31:25,331 --> 01:31:27,124
Can l show you something?

1109
01:31:28,334 --> 01:31:30,836
Only if it's something good. (laughs )

1110
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,339
( sighs )

1111
01:31:33,506 --> 01:31:35,758
(paper rustles )

1112
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:37,593
Read.

1113
01:31:47,728 --> 01:31:52,900
- So, what do you think?
- What do l think? l think it's the berries!

1114
01:31:53,109 --> 01:31:56,654
- You do?
- Yeah. To get away... Chicago...

1115
01:31:56,862 --> 01:31:57,697
God, it's heaven!

1116
01:31:57,905 --> 01:32:00,783
- Have you ever been?
- No, not anywhere.

1117
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:03,202
Helena! (laughs )

Fellas? Got a chair for me?

Nothing.

1185

What are you talking about?
You can't go back in there!

Maybe we can go tomorrow.
We could get Dad to come along.

1213

You'd be right in the middle of things.

1281
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:36,172
(Norman ) There!

1282
01:49:52,897 --> 01:49:55,149
( reel creaks )

1283
01:51:03,592 --> 01:51:05,302
(Paul whoops )

1284
01:51:06,345 --> 01:51:08,222
(Reverend) Oh me, oh my!

1285
01:51:08,389 --> 01:51:10,641
(Norman ) Look at that fish!

1286
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:15,146
(Paul whoops )

1287
01:51:15,354 --> 01:51:17,314
Unbelievable.

1288
01:51:18,607 --> 01:51:22,319
At that moment, l knew,
surely and clearly,...

1289
01:51:22,486 --> 01:51:24,363
..that l was witnessing perfection.

1290
01:51:26,907 --> 01:51:30,536
You... You are a fine fisherman.

1291
01:51:30,703 --> 01:51:33,998
Only need three more years
before l can think like a fish.

1292
01:51:34,165 --> 01:51:37,543
You're already thinking
like a dead stonefly. Picture.

1293
01:51:37,752 --> 01:51:39,128
Mother's pictures.

1294
01:51:39,295 --> 01:51:40,504
- (Paul) Hurry up.
- One.

1295
01:51:40,713 --> 01:51:42,882
(laughs )

1296
01:51:43,049 --> 01:51:44,550
Two.

1297
01:51:44,717 --> 01:51:48,012
My brother stood before us,
not on a bank of the Big Blackfoot River,...

1298
01:51:48,179 --> 01:51:50,431
..but suspended above the earth,...

1299
01:51:50,598 --> 01:51:54,226
..free from all its laws, like a work of art.

1300
01:51:54,393 --> 01:51:56,645
Three!

1301
01:52:00,441 --> 01:52:02,401
(inaudible speech )

1302
01:52:10,242 --> 01:52:13,245
And l knew just as surely
and just as clearly...

1303
01:52:13,412 --> 01:52:15,498
..that life is not a work of art,...

1304
01:52:16,374 --> 01:52:19,251
..and that the moment could not last.

1305
01:52:34,558 --> 01:52:36,977
And so when the police sergeant
awakened me one morning,...

1306
01:52:37,186 --> 01:52:39,105
..just before Jessie and l
left for Chicago,...

1307
01:52:39,271 --> 01:52:41,524
..l rose and asked no questions.

1308
01:53:12,263 --> 01:53:15,891
He drove me back home,
down the length of the river,...

1309
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:18,269
..so that l could tell
my father and mother...

1310
01:53:18,477 --> 01:53:20,730
..that Paul had been beaten to death
by the butt of a revolver,...

1311
01:53:20,938 --> 01:53:23,357
..and his body dumped in an alley.

1312
01:54:01,812 --> 01:54:03,773
(door closes )

1313
01:54:06,192 --> 01:54:09,070
ls there anything else you can tell me?

1314
01:54:13,908 --> 01:54:17,036
Nearly all the bones in his hand
were broken.

1315
01:54:36,097 --> 01:54:38,099
Which hand?

1316
01:54:40,684 --> 01:54:42,687
His right hand.

1317
01:55:11,966 --> 01:55:13,634
( sighs )

1318
01:55:17,346 --> 01:55:20,474
As time passed, my father struggled
for more to hold on to,...

1319
01:55:20,683 --> 01:55:24,645
..asking me again and again,
had l told him everything?

1320
01:55:24,812 --> 01:55:27,148
And finally, l said to him...

1321
01:55:27,356 --> 01:55:29,859
.. ''Maybe all l really know about Paul...

1322
01:55:30,026 --> 01:55:32,278
..is that he was a fine fisherman. ''

1323
01:55:32,486 --> 01:55:35,865
''You know more than that, ''
my father said.

1324
01:55:36,073 --> 01:55:37,658
''He was beautiful. ''

1325
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:43,372
And that was the last time
we ever spoke of my brother's death.

1326
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:57,261
lndirectly, though, Paul was always
present in my father's thoughts.

1327
01:55:57,470 --> 01:56:02,475
l remember the last sermon l heard him
give, not long before his own death.

1328
01:56:03,392 --> 01:56:05,269
Each one of us here today...

1329
01:56:05,436 --> 01:56:08,314
..will at one time in our lives...

1330
01:56:08,481 --> 01:56:13,152
..look upon a loved one in need
and ask the same question.

1331
01:56:14,111 --> 01:56:18,699
''We are willing to help, Lord,
but what, if anything, is needed?''

1332
01:56:20,826 --> 01:56:24,121
For it is true
we can seldom help those closest to us.

1333
01:56:24,288 --> 01:56:27,583
Either we don't know
what part of ourselves to give,...

1334
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:31,879
..or, more often than not,
the part we have to give...

1335
01:56:32,046 --> 01:56:34,215
..is not wanted.

1336
01:56:34,965 --> 01:56:38,010
And so it is those we live with
and should know...

1337
01:56:38,177 --> 01:56:40,262
..who elude us.

1338
01:56:42,431 --> 01:56:44,683
But we can still love them.

1339
01:56:45,267 --> 01:56:47,520
We can love completely...

1340
01:56:47,728 --> 01:56:50,940
..without complete understanding.

1341
01:57:29,854 --> 01:57:34,942
Now, nearly all those l loved and did not
understand in my youth are dead,...

1342
01:57:35,109 --> 01:57:37,069
..even Jessie.

1343
01:57:37,236 --> 01:57:39,321
But l still reach out to them.

1344
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,128
Of course, now l'm too old
to be much of a fisherman.

1345
01:57:54,628 --> 01:57:57,631
And now l usually fish
the big waters alone,...

1346
01:57:57,798 --> 01:58:00,301
..although some friends think l shouldn't.

1347
01:58:08,309 --> 01:58:12,021
But when l am alone
in the half-light of the canyon,...

1348
01:58:12,229 --> 01:58:16,567
..all existence seems to fade
to a being with my soul and memories,...

1349
01:58:17,234 --> 01:58:21,655
..and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot
River and a four-count rhythm...

1350
01:58:21,822 --> 01:58:24,325
..and the hope that a fish will rise.

1351
01:58:37,546 --> 01:58:40,758
Eventually, all things merge into one...

1352
01:58:43,928 --> 01:58:46,514
..and a river runs through it.

1353
01:58:52,561 --> 01:58:55,564
The river was cut
by the world's great flood...

1354
01:58:55,731 --> 01:58:59,276
..and runs over rocks
from the basement of time.

1355
01:58:59,985 --> 01:59:03,531
And some of the rocks
are timeless raindrops.

1356
01:59:04,198 --> 01:59:06,450
Under the rocks are the words,...

1357
01:59:07,368 --> 01:59:09,870
..and some of the words are theirs.

1358
01:59:19,547 --> 01:59:21,716
l am haunted by waters.

1359
01:59:34,603 --> 01:59:37,982
