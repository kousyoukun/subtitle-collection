1
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,232
<i>Case number, 99-RO-6752.</i>

2
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,276
<i>Name, Kim Ki-beom.</i>

3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,152
Accused of murder.

4
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,613
For murder charges 1 through 6,

5
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,408
circumstantial evidence is acknowledged,

6
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,619
but due to insufficient evidence,
the defendant is found not guilty.

7
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,664
For the last charge, number 7,
the murder of Jung Yoon-jung,

8
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:25,127
there is ample circumstantial evidence
and testimony from the informant.

9
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,878
The court finds the defendant guilty

10
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:31,466
and sentences him to 15 years in prison.

11
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,595
How can you end the cases like this?

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,347
-15 years?
-That's not enough.

13
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,600
Bring my son back!

14
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,394
That bastard killed my sister!

15
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,319
You call this justice?

16
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,197
Sons of bitches!

17
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,368
You killed the Chief too, son of a bitch.

18
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,412
When you get out,

19
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:05,125
I'll put you on the stand again,
mother fucker!

20
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,419
Life isn't as easy as you think.

21
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:08,962
You mother...

22
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,589
Let go!

23
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,424
Let go!

24
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:30,460
THREE MONTHS EARLIER

25
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,795
Hi, detective Ban. It's me.

26
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,004
Did you arrive alright?

27
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,384
I'll be there as soon as I make
breakfast for Hee-joo.

28
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,970
Watch closely until he shows up.

29
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,307
<i>He's dangerous, so don't act alone.</i>

30
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,146
Thank you.

31
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,880
Hee-joo!

32
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,057
Hee-joo...

33
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,787
Hee... Hee-joo.

34
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,920
Hee-joo...

35
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,099
Did your mom's surgery go well?

36
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,434
Yes.

37
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,313
It's hard to work again
after taking a few days of rest.

38
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,440
Taking care of your mom is not rest.

39
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,526
By the way...

40
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,822
our Chief lives in the basement here?

41
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,324
I'll say this one more time.

42
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,118
Don't you say anything in front of him.

43
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,247
It's because his wife ran off,
leaving him gambling debt.

44
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,414
What?

45
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,001
So unfortunate!

46
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,259
Go and check if he's there!

47
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,469
OK.

48
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,849
What's up with the cake?

49
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,600
Didn't you know?

50
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,436
It's the Chief's birthday.

51
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,939
-Jeez!
-What?

52
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,277
He looks like a bear.

53
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,195
But he is tender inside.

54
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,412
Hee-joo!

55
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,252
Hee-joo.

56
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,967
Are you waiting for someone?

57
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,864
15 YEARS LATER

58
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,076
It must've been so hard!

59
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,120
Don't come back here ever again.

60
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,163
You have to eat this.

61
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,456
Do you remember me?

62
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,335
Eat this, so you don't come back.

63
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,546
I missed you.

64
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,715
Let's go and eat.

65
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,850
You look good.

66
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,186
Happy to see me?

67
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,273
If you are, share a cigarette.

68
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,945
While you were in prison,
cigarette prices went up four times.

69
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,739
Get your own.

70
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,451
Do you still think I killed all of them?

71
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,244
Yes.

72
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:57,996
Crazy.

73
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,166
You...

74
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,210
need more prison time.

75
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,212
Why?

76
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,715
Because you paid for only one murder.

77
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,468
You must pay for six more.

78
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,553
That's what you think.

79
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,096
Look forward to it.

80
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,558
No matter what it takes,

81
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,351
I will put you back in there.

82
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,108
If you feel remorse, even just for a bit,

83
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,777
call me, OK?

84
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,982
<i>Without music,</i>
<i>life would be a mistake.</i>

85
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,155
<i>Nietzsche.</i>

86
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,243
Liberal arts class done!

LETTER OF APPOINTMENT FOR STUDENT SCOUT
NAM HEE-JOO

89
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,353
Hello!

90
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,605
-Hi, Gun-wook!
-Hi!

91
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,148
What's this?

92
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,858
It's a ribbon.

93
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,761
Mom!

94
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,652
Oh no!

95
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,659
Oh yeah!

96
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,454
50,000 won bill is here.

97
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,790
50,000 won bill--

98
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,001
-I told you to be nice to a woman.
-Jeez!

99
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,711
You again!

100
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,087
You!

101
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,216
Why do you appear out of the blue
once in a while?

102
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,051
You will die soon.

103
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,511
What?

104
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,389
What a crazy bitch!

105
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,225
She is happily crazy!

106
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,103
Crazy bitch! Damn it.

107
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,274
Good morning.

108
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,569
Our loyal girl came!

109
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,115
What day is today?

110
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,285
Today is Breast Cancer Awareness Day.

111
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,540
-Take care.
-Bye.

112
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,583
Thank you!

113
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,019
Welcome, rookie.

114
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,270
Yes, sir!

115
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,856
-Take this.
-OK.

116
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,276
Put it on.

117
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,533
Hurry and put it on!

118
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,912
May I put it on my pants?

119
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,497
No!

120
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,500
Put it up there.

121
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,627
It'll make a hole on my jacket.

122
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,462
I have one too.

123
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,674
Why? Are you embarrassed?

124
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,760
No, this leather jacket is new...

125
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,429
Why do I need to put this on?

126
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,973
-Want to know?
-Yes.

127
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,266
You don't need to know.

128
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,769
-Detective Yoon!
-Yes, Chief.

129
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,104
We're missing one.

130
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,732
That's weird. I collected from everyone.

131
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,610
Someone didn't pay...

132
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,487
And here he is.

133
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,365
You got paid, right?

134
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,910
Wait a moment. Hold on.

135
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,870
Report to the Chief.

136
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,753
Reporting to you, sir.

137
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,341
I'm new detective Cha Dae-sup--

138
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,094
Enough. Pay 10,000 won.

139
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,595
Excuse me?

140
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,556
-Did you get paid?
-Yes.

141
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,433
Pay 10,000 won, now.

142
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,103
What are you doing?

143
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,354
Oh, yes.

144
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:41,941
10,000 won.

145
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,278
Go now.

146
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,195
Yes, sir.

147
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,244
Dae-young!

148
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,497
Did you know that bastard got out?

149
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes. I saw him this morning.

150
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,627
You sleep here every night.

151
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,838
When did you have time to go there?

152
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,673
Hey.

153
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:10,178
Don't confront him recklessly
like you did before.

154
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,513
Now we do scientific investigations.

155
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,515
-We work in the frame--
-Hee-joo!

156
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,725
Uncle!

157
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,187
Who's here? It's Hee-joo!

158
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,315
Today's your payday, right?

159
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,027
This is a special bonus from me.

160
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,279
Thank you.

161
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,365
It's for not being lost
and coming here safely.

162
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,492
This is your paycheck.

163
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,203
Thank you.

164
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,748
-Dae-young--
-Shall we get something to eat?

165
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,791
-OK.
-Let's go.

166
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,126
Dae-young!

167
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,046
-Bye!
-Yeah, yeah!

168

Oh...

170
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,083
The sweetie is asleep.

171
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,629
She must be cold.

00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,101
Follow this bastard.

173
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,269
Oh, Chief!

174
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,605
-This sucker is...
-Yes, it's him.

175
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,608
-Watch him your entire shift.
-Yes!

176
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,236
By the way...

177
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,363
he's not a suspect.

178
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,574
The Justice Department
will take care of him.

179
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,866
Do you want to be the Chief?

180
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,160
No.

181
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,330
So, according to the Chief,

182
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,084
Kim Ki-beom is responsible for
all the murders.

183
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,003
How did he get caught?

184
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,798
As it happened a long time ago,
I don't know it well, either.

185
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,467
After Chief Nam was killed,

186
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,596
everyone in the department got furious.

187
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:22,310
Then Kim Ki-beom killed
his cheating girlfriend and got caught

188
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,353
with the help of an informant.

189
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,563
Informant...

190
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,859
The Supreme Court's
decision could have been right.

191
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,695
Of course it could be. But...

192
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:37,408
he was found on all CCTVs

193
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,410
where the victims were killed.

194
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,954
-There were CCTVs...
-Yes.

195
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,124
How did he kill them?

196
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,668
That...

197
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,755
He pulled their arms back
to break them,

198
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,842
and suffocated the victims
with a bag over their faces.

199
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,512
Sometimes he hung the victims
with dog collars,

200
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,265
and cut their body parts.

201
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,438
Aren't you scared?

202
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,107
-I am.
-Yeah.

203
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,319
Honey! Do you want a massage, too?

204
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,031
No.

205
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,449
Do you want to shower together?

206
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,242
Take everything off except your panties.

207
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,578
What the...

208
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,206
You are a pervert.

209
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,917
At least you are honest.

210
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Are you really a pervert?

211
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,132
I am.

212
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,885
Hey hey!

213
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,638
No, hold on!

214
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,307
Oh my.

215
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,518
Why do you have all your clothes on?

216
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,145
If I had my clothes on,
I wouldn't have been caught.

217
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,563
Caught for what?

218
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,859
You don't want to know.

219
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,513
<i>Yoon-jung...</i>

220
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,725
<i>I will send Min-soo to you too.</i>

221
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,047
RAMADA MOTEL

222
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,426
Damn son of a bitch!
He almost killed me.

223
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,473
Screw your wife like that, asshole!

224
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,018
God damned mother fucker!

225
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,192
Damn, it hurts!

226
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,194
Pervert ass.

227
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,156
Why? Did he try to renovate your thing?

228
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,282
Stop.

229
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,577
I gotta quit this shit.

230
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,413
I'm going to go pee.

231
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,166
Should I get some ointment?

232
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,710
Let me see. Is it OK?

233
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,086
Quit it! Cut it out!

234
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,564
I'm sure it's around here.

235
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,316
Ramada, there.

236
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,235
Yes, that's it.

237
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,702
-Rookie.
-Yes.

238
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,621
Go get some snacks.

239
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,333
I'll go find out
what room Kim Ki-beom is in.

240
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,624
What the fuck!

241
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,170
You son of a bitch!

242
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,672
You want to die?

243
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,549
Me?

244
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,385
You mother fucker!

245
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,993
Why are you riding in the back?

246
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,662
We have to go to Prince Hotel.
Let's go.

247
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,583
Damn, it hurts!

248
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,047
He must be watching
pervert things all the time.

249
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,728
Who is he?

250
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,441
Who is...

251
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,611
doing my homework?

252
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,825
Things are getting
as complicated as philosophy.

253
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,272
Excuse me.

254
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,733
Chief!

255
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,030
What happened?

256
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,658
We found them while changing shifts.

257
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,161
What were you doing all night?

258
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,123
What about that bastard?

259
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,458
We got him just in case.

260
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,669
But I don't think he is the one.

261
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:04,712
What?

262
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,464
The front desk clerk said

263
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,550
he stayed in the room

264
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,343
except to go out
for morning exercise.

265
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,596
What about motel CCTVs?

266
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,473
I checked.

267
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,308
But there's no recording.

268
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,020
What about TV program listing?

269
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,438
Excuse me?

270
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,691
Find out every program
that aired last night!

271
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,817
Got it?

272
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,901
Yes, sir!

273
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,697
Why did you kill them?

274
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,162
You know you got the wrong guy.

275
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,416
No I don't. You are everywhere.

276
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,753
I didn't go out all night,

277
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,005
so I wasn't on CCTVs.

278
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,050
I just watched TV in the room.

279
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,261
I can write a report
on the programs aired.

280
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,098
And most importantly,

281
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm more curious and dumbfounded
than you are.

282
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,237
Haste makes waste.

283
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,535
If you make a hasty move,
I'll be found not guilty again.

284
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,461
Jeez. I got out after 15 years.

285
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,213
The world has no compassion now.

286
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,758
You brought me here
for sleeping with a woman.

287
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:35,928
Go.

288
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,679
Who's the bastard?

289
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,639
Who?

290
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,934
Tell me who that bastard is.

291
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,269
You are going crazy again.

292
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,898
I tell you about the informant
so you can go and kill him?

293
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,116
I don't just go around and kill people.

294
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,539
What's in your mind?

295
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,048
Superiority?

296
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,096
Let him go.

297
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,015
Get up.

298
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,190
What the hell!

299
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,337
NAM HEE-JOO

300
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,098
Detective Yoo?

301
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,058
Yes, sir?

302
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,519
About the informant on Kim Ki-beom
15 years ago...

303
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,437
Yes.

304
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,524
Find out who he is.
I have a weird feeling about this.

305
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,776
BLEACH

306
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,827
Did you make the credit card?

307
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,132
Are you crazy?

308
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,092
I am. So what?

309
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,263
What the... Hey!

310
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,810
That bitch is just asking to get beaten.
Come here!

311
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,442
How many times did I tell you?

312
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:19,943
What a bitch!

313
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,406
Just do as I say!

314
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,877
I have to beat you up to make you listen.

315
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,296
She just had to make a card.

316
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:44,468
People will think I am a wife beater,
damn bitch!

317
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,054
I warned you death is near.

318
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,430
It's you again?

319
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,640
Damn! This is crazy.

320
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,643
What a fucking annoying day!
Everybody is getting on my nerves!

321
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:58,523
Hey crazy, I'm not in a good mood.
Get lost.

322
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,525
What?

323
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,527
-You get lost.
-What?

324
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,029
I finally need you.

325
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,614
You bitch...

326
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,506
In Saudi Arabia,

327
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:26,093
assault and theft carry
the death penalty.

328
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,970
The law is supposed to be

329
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,349
fair and equal to all citizens.

330
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,608
Nice picture.

331
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,614
Shouldn't you eat breakfast
before a nap?

332
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,033
How will you catch criminals like this?

333
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,869
Come back in 30 minutes,

334
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,205
or you'll be considered to have killed
someone.

335
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,416
Jeez.

336
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,961
I told you I don't just go
around killing people.

337
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,796
Close the door, son of a bitch.

338
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,256
It's cold.

339
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,869
Call the police.

340
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,556
It's scary.

341
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,641
It's not safe here.

342
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,974
PE class done!

343
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,198
<i>Just wait.</i>

344
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,537
<i>You will be punished for the rest.</i>

345
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,845
The victim's wife is Hee-joo's mom.

346
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,389
What about Hee-joo?

347
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,891
Did you tell her?

348
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,518
Not yet.

349
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,896
The murder pattern is just like
the one 15 years ago.

350
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,900
Three people died within
two days after his release.

351
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,779
Why are you not granting
an arrest warrant?

352
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,781
He wasn't caught on site.

353
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,660
We need evidence to ask for the warrant.

354
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,746
Since when did we follow
the process so well?

355
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,041
-We acted on hunch to send them to prison.
-Hey!

356
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,001
Are we in the Reformation Age?

357
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,461
If you are that smart,

358
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,755
what did you do all night,
watching over him?

359
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,299
-Sir!
-What? What?

360
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,259
Am I wrong?

361
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,356
How long are you going to be
obsessed with him?

362
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,653
Calm down.

363
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,488
There will be another chance.

364
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,991
If not...

365
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,912
maybe you can carry out a sting operation.

366
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,449
I guess

367
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,703
handling this without facing him...

368
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,123
will be difficult.

369
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,782
Hey serial killer, are you sleeping?

370
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,798
You shouldn't invade my privacy.

371
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,634
It's a welfare check, not an invasion.

372
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,972
You didn't come out all day,
so I am checking if you're still alive.

373
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,646
You committed too many crimes

374
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,357
to sleep comfortably everywhere.

375
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,658
I have a guest.

376
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,873
Is there someone behind me?

377
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,294
Look behind, if you're curious.

378
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,367
You left without saying a word again...

379
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,454
Mom.

380
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,654
How can you eat ramen now?

381
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,243
You need to add chili powder like this,

382
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,870
to make it delicious.

383
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,540
What are you doing?

384
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,086
You like to slice...

385
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,049
food...

386
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,470
and people.

387
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,431
Don't make things up.

388
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,477
Because of that fucking belief,

389
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,689
you're still alive.

390
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,286
Three more have been killed.

391
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,997
If you include the immediate family,

392
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,124
three times four is 12.

393
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,086
You ruined lives of

394
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,255
12 more people.

395
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,756
When I was in prison,

396
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,217
you came and freaked out every year

397
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,303
on the date of Chief Nam's death.

398
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:42,930
Was that guilt?

399
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,185
It was a duty.

400
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,103
Then...

401
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,523
why did you ask
someone else to do your job?

402
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,901
Even if you had a personal reason,

403
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,695
he died because he covered for you.

404
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,864
You must feel sorry.

405
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,284
Do you want to die?

406
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,912
You speak so easy.

407
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,248
Life is not as easy as you think.

408
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,709
You speak so annoyingly.

409
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,671
-Don't you?
-Maybe I'm superior at something.

410
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,384
No Chief, stop!

411
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,845
-Let go.
-No!

412
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:09,600
Is that a smile?

413
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,852
You think this is fun?

414
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,272
Since I didn't have to pay for my food,

415
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,357
I will give you a hint.

416
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,653
I know you killed them all!

417
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,497
Five more.

418
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,126
It is a total of 12 people.

419
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:36,919
What?

420
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,463
When the bodies are buried deep,
you can't find them.

421
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,383
You son of a bitch!

422
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,435
Before I killed Chief Nam,

423
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,229
he was on my nerves like you.

424
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,816
I'm only telling you.

425
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,319
You know I can't be indicted again.

426
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,115
You mother fucker!

427
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,620
Say that again, son of a bitch!

428
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,623
-Chief!
-Mother fucker!

429
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:19,211
Let go! Let go of me.

430
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,048
One who likes to stab.

431
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,842
One who likes to cut.

432
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,643
There were two!

433
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,275
<i>give all loyalty...</i>

434
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:47,990
<i>With this spirit</i>

435
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,535
<i>and this mind,</i>

436
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:58,209
<i>give all loyalty...</i>

437
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,381
Min-soo.

438
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,724
Ki-beom, how long will you date Yoon-jung?

439
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,144
What do you mean, asshole?

440
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,106
Until the mark on her nose goes away.

441
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,778
Do you like her?

442
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,197
Of course not!

443
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,993
But I will look better with her!

444
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,038
You bastard!

445
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,332
Idiot!

446
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,383
Chief?

447
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,052
This is Kim's phone record.

448
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,931
Where did he call so much in prison?

449
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,016
So I investigated.

450
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,186
He called a man named Jung Min-soo.

451
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,481
I think he is looking for this guy.

452
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,733
Find out who he is.

453
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,152
Yes, sir.

454
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,658
-Detective Yoo?
-Yes, sir.

455
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,452
How did it go?

456
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:16,829
How did what go?

457
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,206
Did you find the informant on Kim?

458
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,791
Oh, that!

459
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,503
I told Hee-joo to put it on your desk.

460
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,800
It must be around there.

461
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,640
JUNG MIN-SOO

462
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,726
Jung Min-Soo.

463
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,986
The informant 15 years ago...

464
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:54,617
WAS THE SAME AGE AS KIM
AND WAS FROM THE SAME ORPHANAGE.

465
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,828
Then, they are friends.

466
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,969
The last victim 15 years ago...

467
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,015
Kim killed his cheating girlfriend.

468
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,686
He was arrested on a tip from his friend

469
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,692
Kim doesn't know who informed on him.

470
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,111
After getting out of prison,

471
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,948
he's looking all over for Jung.

472
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,327
Then...

473
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:57,471
Hello!

474
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,390
Do you have a leash?

475
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,350
How big is your dog?

476
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,561
-As big as me.
-Wow.

477
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,938
You must have a big dog.

478
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,651
No, I'm about to catch one now.

479
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,194
Excuse me?

480
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,240
Can you get one quickly?
I am little busy.

481
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,324
Of course.

482
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,372
Will this work?

483
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,588
<i>Who executes a murderer?</i>

484
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:32,715
Cops?

485
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,510
Or judges and prosecutors
who only follow precedents

486
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,637
like monkeys?

487
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,264
Bullshit.

488
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,392
It's the evidence.

489
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,603
Follow Jung Min-soo.

490
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,439
Follow Kim too.

491
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,525
Wait until they meet

492
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,277
and arrest him on the spot.

493
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,655
Jung has to be unharmed.

494
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,742
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

495
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,542
RAMADA MOTEL

496
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,800
Where did they go?

497
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,353
Where are you hiding?

498
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:31,649
<i>Hello?</i>

499
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:36,487
<i>Hello?</i>

500
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,263
INFORMANT INFORMATION

501
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,688
Chief is doing my work.

502
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:35,671
Thank you.

503
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,506
Thank you.

504
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,843
Just leave my stuff here.

505
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,302
OK.

506
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,910
Why did you do that?

507
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:11,331
Do what?

508
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,089
I would've given her to you
if you'd asked.

509
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,926
Why did you steal her
and squeal to the police?

510
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,637
I didn't steal her.

511
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,558
She just didn't love you anymore.

512
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,478
So your love is pure?

513
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,568
Min-soo,

514
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,655
you can't beat me
because of all those emotions.

515
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,241
That's what you think.

516
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,790
When we killed those people,

517
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,710
what would have they thought about?

518
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,801
They couldn't think
because it hurt too much.

519
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,059
That's why they just gasp.

520
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,983
You know I don't joke around.

521
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,573
You won't sleep at night anymore.

522
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,118
The next time we meet,

523
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:36,291
I'll rip you up into pieces
through the veins while you are alive.

524
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,795
Watch out.

525
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,593
Son of a bitch.

526
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,431
So scared already. That's no fun.

527
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,688
Smoke this.

528
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:49,990
Who are you?

529
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,328
You didn't fall down.

530
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,207
Hold on.

531
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,785
You confused me.

532
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,471
Calluses on your thumb.

533
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,977
The one who likes to cut.

534
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,814
You must've been his helper.

535
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:09,361
You are lucky to be used as bait
without feeling the misery.

536
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,582
Bear the pain, too.

537
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,640
I stabbed the knife into your third rib.

538
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,975
It'll be hard to move.

539
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,438
-Who are you?
-Me?

540
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,026
A woman who thought of you
since a very young age.

541
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,654
Bitch, just kill me.

542
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,741
Then, the truth will be buried, too.

543
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,504
Now you will be caught in the act.

544
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,178
If you don't kill me now,

545
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,723
you won't beat me.

546
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,851
I am a cop in name.

547
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,437
I can't kill you to become a target.

548
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,748
You know what?

549
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,170
The accident is momentary,

550
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,632
but the tragedy lasts a long time.

551
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,682
You should feel the tragedy
before you die.

552
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,769
This is Jung Min-soo.

553
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,359
He's still in the building.

554
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,735
Search everywhere.

555
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,530
-Police!
-Police!

556
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,437
Wake up.

557
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,190
Don't lose it. Wake up!

558
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:58,984
Can you hear me?

559
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,944
What's your name?

560
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,438
Son of a bitch!

561
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,355
Your name?

562
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,027
Age?

563
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,556
Ms. Victim?

564
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,352
Do you know the difference
between a witness and a victim?

565
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,105
It's whether they can talk or not.

566
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,232
P... please save me.

567
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,736
Silence is assuring more than anything.

568
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,883
You!

569
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,719
You should thank me.

570
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,306
If you saw my eyes,
you'd be dead too.

571
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:59,270
You idiots! Morons!

572
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:02,732
This is how I got kicked
in the headquarters.

573
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:04,692
What's this?

574
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,320
Stupid!

575
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,365
-You!
-Yes, sir.

576
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:14,786
-You have the suspect, no?
-I do.

577
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,871
Where is he, then?

578
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,794
People are getting killed.

579
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,921
The suspect is nowhere to be found.

580
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,006
Are you kidding me?

581
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,177
Put a reward on him.

582
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,222
Use the media and everything. Understood?

583
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,223
Yes, sir!

584
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,017
This is hard, right?

585
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,603
Should I let you go?

586
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,689
Don't you get it?

587
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,732
Get him no matter what!

588
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,277
Even those who look look like him!

589
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,445
Yes, sir.

590
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,822
-What are you doing?
-Let's go!

591
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,657
Move quickly.

592
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,049
LONDON SYMPHONY PERFORMANCE

593
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,856
PURCHASE COMPLETED

594
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,276
By the performance day,

595
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,403
he will be caught.

596
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,161
That bitch!

597
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,166
How dare you touch my game?

598
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,668
About catching Kim,

599
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,379
we are searching for him

600
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,048
throughout our district,
Seoul and Gyeonggi.

601
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,050
Chief?

602
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,013
We cannot rule out the possibility

603
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,391
that Kim didn't kill Jung.

604
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,893
Here are the profiling
and crime scene reports.

605
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,608
Given Kim's injury,

606
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:36,070
he seems unrelated to the death of Jung.

607
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:45,830
WANTED KIM KI-BEOM
REWARD 50 MILLION WON

608
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,567
Hey detectives!

609
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,321
The timestamps don't align.

610
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,909
We were together
when the people were killed.

611
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,036
How could I be the killer?

612
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,587
Hello? Kyungmin Newspaper?

613
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,925
May I speak to crime reporter Park?

614
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,565
KYUNGMIN NEWSPAPER

615
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:45,199
MURDER SUSPECT CALLED PERSONALLY
TO CLAIM INNOCENCE

616
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,080
Guest number 337!

617
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,877
Guest number 337!

618
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:58,963
Here.

619
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,134
Damn it.

620
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,679
Let's all quit together.

621
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,686
-You!
-Yes, sir.

622
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:17,398
You were the one who watched him
while people were being killed.

623
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:18,608
Correct.

624
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,610
Then, how can he be the murderer?

625
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,069
Did you kill them?

626
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,696
Or were you just slacking?

627
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,365
I didn't.

628
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:30,161
-But he is the murderer for sure.
-Based on what?

629
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,580
There aren't his fingerprints.

630
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,791
How can you tell he is the killer?

631
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,835
It looks like we are just making
things up.

632
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,421
If he strongly denies it like before,

633
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:41,547
what will you do?

634
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,597
-Captain Ban.
-Yes, sir!

635
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,182
Wrap it up this week.

636
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,102
Yes, sir.

637
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:06,614
Uncle!

638
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,825
-Hee-joo!
-Here.

639
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:10,743
What's this?

640
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,664
Why didn't you eat?

641
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:17,875
Wow.

642
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,087
You got these because I didn't eat?

643
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,258
You didn't eat either?

644
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,718
I did eat.

645
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,263
And you're eating again?

646
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:34,225
Since you didn't eat,
I thought we could eat together.

647
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,898
You are the only one who cares about me.

648
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:44,443
Let's eat.

649
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,031
-Uncle.
-Hmm?

650
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:54,620
I thought a lot about
being courageous for justice.

651
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,080
Yes?

652
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:02,003
There's only one way for the evil to win.

653
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:03,588
What's that?

654
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,592
When innocent people do nothing.

655
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:15,766
I'll be courageous, so you should be too,

656
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,351
for justice!

657
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,857
You're right. Fight on!

658
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,277
Let's eat.

659
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:32,325
SHINYANG SENIOR CENTER

660
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,370
Min-soo and I killed 12 people,
15 years ago.

661
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,916
And six people have been killed this time.

662
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,793
Now the murders that only I know are...

663
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,216
two in front of the motel,

664
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,179
and two in the ambulance.

665
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,681
And one of these was

666
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:57,600
Min-soo.

667
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,065
The walking path...

668
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:13,032
What is this awkward one?

669
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,703
I stabbed the knife into your third rib.

670
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,915
A woman in her 20s.

671
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:25,044
A woman who thought of you
since a very young age.

672
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,463
She knows me.

673
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,011
What's their relationship?

674
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,063
If I die,

675
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,901
the bitch will be the suspect.

676
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,669
You must be starving.

677
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,588
I am OK.
I had three bottles of strawberry milk.

678
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,632
-Hee-joo, eat.
-OK.

679
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,511
-Dad!
-Yes?

680
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,556
How come your food tastes so good?

681
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,643
Is it not good?

682
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,062
No, it's really good.

683
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:29,233
How can it taste
just like food in restaurants?

684
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,902
-Stop teasing me.
-I'm not.

685
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:35,990
I'll marry a good cook like you.

686
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,367
-Really?
-Yes!

687
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,620
You are the best!

688
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:46,834
By the way, did you finish your homework?

689
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,798
PUBLIC SERVANT ID

690
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:53,716
Dad!

691
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,678
My final homework is a bit difficult.

692
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,812
But I'm OK.

693
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,816
I'm the best daughter.

694
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,505
What the heck... Damn it.

695
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,924
Hey, hey.

696
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,510
This is non-smoking area.

697
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,345
Please move to another seat.

698
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,262
No.

699
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,266
There are people here.

700
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,102
This is non-smoking area--

701
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,269
I said fucking no.

702
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,899
But there are students here.

703
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,276
So please...

704
01:16:58,531 --> 01:16:59,490
Then...

705
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,994
-smoke just a little.
-Get lost.

706
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,056
Thank you.

707
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:29,937
Sir, we're getting close,

708
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,439
but not close enough.

709
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:36,652
Hello!

710
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,199
We're at the intersection now.

711

PSYCHOPATH LEAVES THE BODY TO SHOW OFF

712
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,889
THE WIFE WHO LOST BOTH HUSBANDS HAS DIED.

713
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,600
Chief Nam who died 15 years ago

714
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,311
and the victim this time had

715
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,563
the same wife?

716
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:24,825
POLICE CHIEF FOUND DEAD
NEXT TO YOUNG DAUGHTER

A woman in her 20s.

718
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:28,787
The bitch who knows me.

719
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,538
-I will be back. Stand by.
-Yes, sir.

720
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:28,681
What are you doing?

721
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:30,349
I'm standing by.

722
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:34,228
You must block here in case he runs away!

723
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,604
Ah, OK.

724
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,690
Yes, sir.

725
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,277
Take care.

726
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,573
-Bye!
-Thank you.

727
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:47,741
Hello!

728
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,163
-I'm the Police.
-Yes.

729
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,208
He's over there.

732
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:32,953
Don't be scared.

733
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:38,751
Please stand at this wall side.

734
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:53,242
I don't want to work all night either.

735
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,433
Track my car now.

736
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,726
Just do it!

737
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,570
Don't die.
That will complicate the situation.

738
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:43,292
What's the vehicle?

739
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:08,984
We must track the vehicle.

740
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,737
-Upon finding it, send everyone out.
-Yes, sir.

741
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:15,282
-Ask Traffic Control to help.
-Yes, sir.

742
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:19,661
Don't just answer. Use your brain!

743
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,914
Trace his location using his phone.

744
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:26,960
Send the plate number to Traffic Control
so that it goes out to the media.

745
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,422
Tell all the drivers and delivery people.

746
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,382
Damn it. Do whatever you can.

747
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:33,509
Yes, sir.

748
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,262
Where the hell did he go?

749
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,895
-May I help you?
-I'm good. Don't get up.

750
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,024
-Working late!
-I'm fine.

751
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,902
I'm Detective Cha.
I need do a search on someone.

752
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:17,988
OK. What's the resident's number?

753
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,657
You know Chief Nam who died on duty?

754
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,785
Well, I've been on dispatch for a while.

755
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,829
It happened 15 years ago,

756
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,082
so you might not know.

757
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,670
Are you talking about the Loyalty's dad?

758
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:35,881
Loyalty?

759
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:38,508
That's what we call her
as she comes to work everyday.

760
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,093
She isn't even a policewoman.

761
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:44,473
Her name is Hee-joo
and she's the late Chief's daughter.

762
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:51,688
NAM HEE-JOO

763
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,607
Nam Hee-joo.

764
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,319
Yes, she is the one. Where is she now?

765
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,321
She must have gone home.

766
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,658
This is urgent.

767
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,868
Can you search her address?

768
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:08,246
I will try to search
the late Chief's record.

769
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,543
-Please hurry.
-Yes, sir.

770
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,131
By the way...

771
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:23,720
don't you know Loyalty, I mean Hee-joo?

772
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,477
I used to work at Seocho Station.

773
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,523
I just transferred here.

774
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,442
Oh, I see.

775
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:39,611
Just a second. I will look for it.

776
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:45,867
Hello!

777
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,412
You're back!

778
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:50,372
Yes.

779
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,082
What do you need this time?

780
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,750
A dog leash.

781
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,545
You just bought one.

782
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,463
I have another dog.

783
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:09,808
We're both lucky today.

784
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,477
You must live so that I can be excused.

785
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,312
Or self-defense?

786
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,079
I'm going to go find the real killer.

787
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:57,063
Damn it. Does this make any sense?

788
01:27:57,147 --> 01:28:00,400
The car we've been searching for was
parked at the police station!

789
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:03,862
How's Detective Cha?

790
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,739
We'll have to wait and see.

791
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:12,454
Where is that mother fucker Kim?

792
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,291
Why didn't anyone stop him?

793
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,543
They use a different radio signal.

794
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,796
The gate guards just...

795
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,819
<i>Those who fight against a monster</i>

796
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,613
<i>should be careful</i>

797
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:32,576
<i>not to become one during the battle.</i>

798
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,917
Nietzsche, you said,

799
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:43,211
"God is dead."

800
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,965
So why did you say not to become one?

801
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:49,968
Because God is dead,

802
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,056
we need a monster.

803
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,075
She still lives in this town.

804
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:25,170
HONOR AWARD

805
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:47,442
443-60.

806
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,553
So this is how it feels.

807
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,805
I warned you.

808
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:00,640
You can't beat me.

809
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,351
The one who likes to stab.

810
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,273
You killed my dad, didn't you?

811
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,442
Good deduction!

812
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,568
Of course!

813
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,821
I've been waiting for you for 15 years.

814
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,874
If something happens to her,
you are a dead man.

815
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,833
You should pay for your crime, bitch!

816
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:53,711
What about you? Did you pay for yours?

817
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,421
Only you have to pay.

818
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:10,395
HEE-JOO

819
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,063
Hee-joo, where are you?

820
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:13,523
What?

821
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:41,259
Come here, bitch!

822
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:00,653
Stop making this difficult!

823
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:20,632
Stupid idiots!
Turn the sirens and lights off!

824
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:26,239
What are you doing?

825
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:30,535
Come down.

826
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:34,747
No.

827
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:53,266
Can you...

828
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:56,978
give that to my Chief uncle?

829
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:03,026
What the hell...

830
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:10,074
This? What's this?

831
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:15,246
You are trampling again
without thinking...

832
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:17,707
as you wish.

833
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:28,843
It's time for us...

834
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,221
to get punished.

835
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:36,768
You and me.

836
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:39,354
Because we killed people.

837
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:41,898
Hey.

838
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:45,193
I'm about to change my mind.

839
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:48,905
Then, you die.

840
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,002
It's because of you.

841
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,129
What?

842
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:07,632
Look what I have become.

843
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:10,259
It's all because of you.

844
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:23,356
Homework done!

845
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:28,486
You killed everyone.
