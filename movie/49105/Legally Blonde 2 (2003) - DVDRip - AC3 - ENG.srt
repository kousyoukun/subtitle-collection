1
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:42,093
Look, her first high-end retail
shopping experience.

2
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:43,888
Her nanny tried
to take her to Baby Gap...

3
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,030
but she'd just cry and cry.

4
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,492
She was a professional shopper
at age three.

5
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:49,777
Oh, wow!

6
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:51,854
Remember when she was on
the cover of "Seventeen"?

7
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,349
She had so much potential
back then.

8
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:57,423
Look at her. She could have been
a Playmate by now.

9
00:00:57,496 --> 00:00:59,950
Hello! She's a lawyer.

10
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:02,413
- That's way better.
- Why?

11
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:03,798
There she is!

12
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,254
You always said she has
the perfect shaped head...

13
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,079
for a tiara!

14
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:12,015
Look at that slime dog!

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,636
It was so nice of you to make
this for Elle's wedding shower.

16
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:18,042
I can't scrapbook worth a damn.

17
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:20,444
I took a class on it
at community college.

18
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,167
- She got a "B."
- Plus!

19
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:26,332
The day she passed her LSAT!

20
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:28,635
I swallowed
some of that Silly String.

21
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:29,978
It wouldn't be the first time.

22
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:33,428
Look at that.
Her first day at Harvard.

23
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:35,325
Unbelievable. Awesome.

24
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:38,622
The Bend and Snap!

25
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:41,307
I love that.
I did it last night naked.

26
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:44,760
- You did not.
- Yes. I busted a window.

27
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:48,379
Oh, my God, there's
Bruiser's first highlights.

28
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:50,872
Is this the key to
her first office at the firm?

29
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:55,203
Remember that Caribbean decor?
It was genius.

30
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:59,676
Look, there she is
with Congresswoman Rudd...

31
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,532
when they started the Harvard
alumni women's event.

32
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:05,085
- Yeah.
- That's two kick-ass women.

33
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,125
I like them. I really like them.

34
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:12,644
The first day they met!
Emmett loves her already.

35
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,719
You can see it in his eyes.

36
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:15,872
Emmett and Elle.

37
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:19,838
They're truly Romeo and Juliet
without the dying.

38
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:21,156
Paulette?

39
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,329
Oh, my God!
Girls, I think it's her.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,734
- Quick! Lights out!
- OK!

41
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,044
Paulette?

42
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:34,411
I thought we were supposed
to be at the movies by 9:00.

43
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:37,324
Surprise!

44
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,323
We got her!

45
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:47,628
Oh, my God! Margot, Serena,
I cannot believe...

46
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:49,288
you guys flew
all the way here!

47
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:51,661
- No biggie.
- On the contrary.

48
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:53,581
It's a huge biggie.
Thank you.

49
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,338
You guys are the best.

50
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:59,370
Speaking of biggies,
can we see your ring again?

51
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:02,638
Not your Delta Nu ring, Elle.

52
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:05,260
You mean, this one?

53
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,575
Clarity between F.L. And V.V.S.
Nice girdle diameter.

54
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,978
Cut impeccable.
It's a keeper.

55
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:15,182
Thanks!

56
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:18,003
Oh, my gosh, it's from Emmett!

57
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,137
That's me and Emmett
on Fenway baseball field.

58
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:22,799
It's his favorite place
in the whole world.

59
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,870
I love snow globes.

60
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:29,171
I can hear the ocean.

61
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,055
Listen, honey,
you're a full-time bride now...

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,845
so you'll need
a whole new wardrobe.

63
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,012
I'm not quitting my job,
you guys.

64
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:39,056
Do you guys remember
that feeling we used to get...

65
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,168
during a really intense
Spinning class?

66
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,268
That we feel so truly amazing
about ourselves?

67
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,925
That's how I feel
being a lawyer. I love it.

68
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,866
I have this huge
annual review coming up...

69
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,047
so keep 'em crossed, girls.

70
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,579
Crossed!

71
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,613
Congratulations, you did it.

72
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:02,482
With three wrong answers,
you've managed to undermine...

73
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:06,652
the entire foundation upon which
our legal system's built.

74
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:09,949
And by the way...

75
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,436
it only took me
two wrong answers.

76
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:24,155
Sweetie, you customized my ring?
Again?

77
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:26,879
Emmett, you are never
going to believe my news!

78
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,987
- What?
- Fenway Park!

79
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:31,929
You, me, two rings, and
one recently ordained umpire...

80
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,183
right on the entry field!

81
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,195
Infield.
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,474
It turns out the starting
pitcher for the Red Sox...

83
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,582
has an unfortunate
unibrow problem.

84
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,630
He goes to Nadia, my waxer...

85
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:43,458
so the team pulled some strings
with the site manager...

86
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:45,119
and we're getting married
at Fenway!

87
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,580
Are you serious?

88
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,754
Are you sure
this is what you want to do?

89
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,340
I can married anywhere
and it wouldn't matter.

90
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,167
That's a lie.

91
00:04:56,235 --> 00:05:00,742
I'm getting married
under the Green Monster!

92
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:02,720
Yes!

93
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:04,682
And in just
three months and four days!

94
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:06,918
Emmett, we have so much
to talk about.

95
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,837
I want everybody
who matters to us to be there.

96
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:14,344
Oh, my God! I almost forgot!

97
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:16,908
You want me to what?

98
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:18,186
You want me to what?

99
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,710
A biological
birth parent search.

100
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:22,572
For your dog.

101
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,869
For my Chihuahua-American
Bruiser Woods.

102
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:29,385
I found him abandoned years ago.

103
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:33,033
Miss, I'm the highest-paid,
most sought after...

104
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:36,040
private investigator
in the greater Boston area.

105
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:37,674
That's precisely why
we came to you, Detective.

106
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:41,293
It is absolutely vital that
we find Bruiser's mother pronto.

107
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:45,456
His father might be
more difficult. You know dogs.

108
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:46,834
May I ask why?

109
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,756
Of course.
"Martha Stewart Weddings"...

110
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,571
recommends a 4 to 6-week
window for RSVPs...

111
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:54,060
and I can't send the invitation
without an address.

112
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:57,364
And the sooner I get started on
the calligraphy the better.

113
00:05:57,431 --> 00:06:00,246
You want to send an invitation
to your wedding...

114
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,767
to your dog's mother.
And you're serious?

115
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,117
Detective,
if I have to make room...

116
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,038
for my second cousin's
vegan diet coach...

117
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:07,762
you better believe
I'll make room for the mother...

118
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:10,419
of the one loving creature
who's always been there for me.

119
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,490
In fact, I can't believe
I haven't done this sooner!

120
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:16,213
I'm thinking the same thing.

121
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,889
- Elle!
- Hi, Mr. Blaine.

122
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,127
- The client is thrilled.
- Good!

123
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:29,498
How you seamlessly
negotiated that deal?

124
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:32,861
- It was simply magnifique.
- Thank you.

125
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,104
Big staff meeting today, kiddo.

126
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:37,589
All right.
I got my fingers crossed.

127
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:39,997
Milton, two shots, extra foam.

128
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:42,616
- Wow. Thanks, E.W.
- No problem!

129
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,858
- Go get 'em today.
- Thanks.

130
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,817
Soy for you, honey. No dairy.

131
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,638
That's right. Thank you.
Your call list is endless.

132
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,595
- It is?
- We better get right on it.

133
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,454
Kevin, you shouldn't have!

134
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,898
I'm not sure they're giving me
the promotion today.

135
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:58,818
It's just a widespread
yet credible rumor.

136
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:01,305
It's from me and the girls.

137
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,005
Oh, right!

138
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,522
Now do me.

139
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,937
I feel like the luckiest girl
in the world.

140
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:13,665
- Me, too!
- You do?

141
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:15,708
I had no idea
I could be this happy...

142
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:18,532
without accruing
credit card debt.

143
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,289
Already?

144
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:23,591
Well, Miss Woods,
even the weird ones get cracked.

145
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:26,307
- You ready?
- Yes!

146
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:31,009
Bruiser Woods...

147
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,504
meet your mom.

148
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,262
Bruiser... your cheekbones.

149
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,499
And it's all in there.

150
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:41,931
Good luck finding whatever
it is you're looking for.

151
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,914
Oh, my God!
She's a Bostonian!

152
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:52,453
Bruiser, we're here!

153
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:54,282
As your adoptive mother,
I'm sure you're nervous...

154
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:55,726
about meeting
your birth mother...

155
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:00,168
but hear her out, OK?
I'm sure she had her reasons.

156
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,542
Bruiser,
your mother lives at...

157
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,268
the top secret
Versace think-tank!

158
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:06,312
I told you they had one!

159
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,466
No, ma'am.

160
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,677
Unless you have a pass,
you cannot go up there.

161
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:11,603
Lucky I always keep it on me.

162
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:14,929
Hold on. It's right here.

163
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,589
There you go.

164
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,635
What is it?

165
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,267
It's my double platinum
V.V.I.P. Versace...

166
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,315
Preferred Customer
identification card.

167
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:25,488
Available only to those that've
shopped on five continents.

168
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,315
If that fails to satisfy you,
you can also contact...

169
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,838
Billy Dailey,
head of customer relations.

170
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,187
You got the wrong VERSACE, lady.

171
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:33,327
Really? Donatella's not here?

172
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:34,642
Bruiser, where are you going?

173
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,719
Bruiser!

174
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,036
Ma'am!

175
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:41,906
Bruiser?

176
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:44,345
Get back here!

177
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,383
Where are you going?

178
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:52,081
Bruiser, I didn't know
you were so athletic.

179
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,190
What is it?

180
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:06,362
Oh, my God!

181
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:13,085
You, come here!

182
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:16,121
Come on!
Open this door immediately!

183
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:17,339
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,916
You have my dog's mom,
and I need her right now!

185
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,927
Absolutely not.
I'm not authorized to release...

186
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,890
any subjects
from their containment units.

187
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:28,737
I'm not even allowed
to have a key.

188
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:30,745
Swallow the thing one time,
and all of a sudden...

189
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:33,604
you're the weird key swallower
who can't be trusted.

190
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:37,499
I don't think
you're understanding me.

191
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:38,979
I'm willing to pay for her.

192
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:40,570
These animals
aren't for sale, ma'am.

193
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:42,304
They're the legal property
of this facility.

194
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,538
What kind of facility is this?

195
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,467
Mr. Livermore, I'm so sorry!

196
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:53,798
Elle, this VERSACE
is a cosmetic testing facility.

197
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:56,898
- Oh, no!
- Bruiser's mom's a test subject.

198
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:58,726
I want her out of there
immediately.

199
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:00,737
Animal test subjects
can only be surrendered...

200
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,048
on a voluntary basis,
and they're not volunteering.

201
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:05,537
After I get through with them,
they'll be begging.

202
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:06,985
And I'm not just taking
Bruiser's mom.

203
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,898
I'll bust all those dogs
out of that doggie dungeon.

204
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:12,199
"Research Science
and Critter Exploitation"?

205
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:15,302
This VERSACE's owned by the
C'est Magnifique Corporation!

206
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,934
That's fantastic!

207
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,306
Our law firm
represents C'est Magnifique.

208
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:20,933
We can tell them to fix this.

209
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,428
I can't wait to take this
to the partners.

210
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:26,470
But how are you
going to convince them?

211
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,431
Presenting...

212
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:35,369
Abandoned at birth, I was
on my own at an early age...

213
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,110
fighting for survival on
the streets of Beverly Hills...

214
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:43,441
making his way down
the boulevard of broken dreams,

215
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:46,704
turning tricks
at Hollywood and Vine...

216
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,009
yet even when
I found a loving mother...

217
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:52,338
I couldn't shake this
nagging emptiness in my heart.

218
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,926
It was like a void.
When I looked in the mirror...

219
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,906
who was it
that was looking back at me?

220
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:59,370
This is Bruiser's question.

221
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:03,309
And in a way,
aren't we all Bruisers?

222
00:11:03,384 --> 00:11:06,515
I think yes. Thank you.

223
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:11,443
Ms. Woods,
this is a law firm...

224
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:14,196
not an animal rights
advocacy group.

225
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:16,599
We're lawyers.
We have to fight for justice.

226
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,521
And this is definitely unjust.

227
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:22,198
In this case, the cost of beauty
is way too high.

228
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,537
I can't believe I said that,
but it's true.

229
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,578
What we fight for...

230
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,855
is our clients
and their best interests.

231
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:32,470
But isn't doing the right thing
in everybody's best interest?

232
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,411
I think you're confusing
the right thing and the law.

233
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:38,998
You didn't think
they were the same, did you?

234
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:42,006
Why don't
we get back to business...

235
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,469
and discuss
your very bright future?

236
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:46,454
Pardon me,
I don't mean to interrupt...

237
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,791
but I just--
What you're saying is...

238
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,379
if C'est Magnifique
follows the letter of the law...

239
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:55,745
even if it ends up
hurting living beings...

240
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:59,837
we're just doing our job?

241
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:03,485
I'm sorry, Mr. Blaine...

242
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:06,753
I don't think I can work
with people who believe that.

243
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,674
You know what? You're right.

244
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:14,913
Thank you, Mr. Blaine.

245
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:17,088
You shouldn't have to work
with people who believe that.

246
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,135
Absolutely.
I knew you would understand.

247
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,378
You're fired, Elle.

248
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,876
What?

249
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,563
We only have room
for serious lawyers here.

250
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:30,342
Take the rest of the day
to clear out your things.

251
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:34,240
But the secretarial pool
already gave me a balloon.

252
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,704
Keep the balloon, if you wish.

253
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:49,228
Please, Emmett, just go away.

254
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:51,497
Why don't you come on out,
sweetie?

255
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:53,573
I know Bruiser
doesn't blame you.

256
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:56,396
But I'm all he has to speak
for him in this world...

257
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,870
and I have
completely failed him.

258
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:01,766
You know what I thought
the first time I saw you?

259
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:05,104
"God, that woman
wears a lot of pink"?

260
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,196
No. I thought...

261
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,754
"That woman is really special."

262
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:15,983
"She believes she can make
a difference and she will."

263
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,688
So... come on out
and let's talk about it.

264
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:22,697
No.

265
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:26,416
We could go over
some wedding details.

266
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,508
How about that? It revolves.

267
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:32,819
And it illuminates.

268
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:35,124
It's even
got the Red Sox colors.

269
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,494
That's fantastic, honey!

270
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,634
Speaking of red socks...

271
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:41,492
you're not getting
cold feet, are you?

272
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,739
About what?

273
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,329
How's it going to look?
A Harvard law professor...

274
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,768
married to a lawyer who
got fired from her first job.

275
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:49,743
Fired for something
she believes in.

276
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,312
It's going to look like...

277
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:56,309
"There goes the luckiest guy
in the whole world."

278
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,314
Thanks.

279
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,653
Holy crap!

280
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:13,620
It's gorgeous!

281
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,637
The material
keeps falling apart.

282
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,173
No!

283
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,352
Amy, is something wrong?

284
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,895
You can't do a scallop trim
on the outer hoop skirt.

285
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:26,685
The material's too delicate.
It'll just fall apart.

286
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:28,892
But in two out of three
home tests it held.

287
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,872
I am so sorry, Elle.

288
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,561
No biggie.
I guess I don't need...

289
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:40,386
a scallop trim
on the outer hoop skirt.

290
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:42,460
I'll be fine.

291
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:44,388
What is it that you said
back when I couldn't...

292
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:48,131
fit into my white spandex
pantsuit for my wedding?

293
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,660
If the fabric
doesn't work with you...

294
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,394
don't work with it.

295
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:52,575
It's one of
my favorite mantras.

296
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:55,911
That is so true, and I know
the most perfect organza!

297
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,791
Or something
really classy like...

298
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,279
like white leather!

299
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:04,387
I'll call the guy
that did my car seats.

300
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:07,719
Wait... that's it.

301
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:12,009
Don't fight the fabric.
Change it.

302
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:14,793
OK, but white leather?

303
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,497
If the law is what's keeping
Bruiser's mother locked up...

304
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:21,769
I shouldn't be fighting it,
I should be changing it.

305
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,620
Everybody, I'm going to make...

306
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,924
animal testing
for cosmetics illegal!

307
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,602
I know that making a dog wear
mascara and blush is wrong...

308
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,460
This isn't just about
Bruiser's mom anymore...

309
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:34,022
this is about the fact
that every day...

310
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,300
that I put on my Gold Goddess
luminescent blush...

311
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,436
some poor little innocent animal
might be suffering for it.

312
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,546
You don't realize
how horrible something is...

313
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:43,178
until it happens to you
personally.

314
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,972
Like breastfeeding.

315
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,659
And if I want to give
a voice to Bruiser...

316
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,967
I have to go to the place
that gave a voice to the people!

317
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:54,738
Oh, my God! The headquarters
of "Cosmopolitan" magazine!

318
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:58,864
Better! Ladies...

319
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,908
I'm going to Washington!

320
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,341
D.C., here I come!

321
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,782
If anybody can handle this,
it's you, honey.

322
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:09,230
I got a call from the Delta Nu
24-hour housing hotline.

323
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,613
Your apartment's all set.

324
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,917
- Great!
- Elle!

325
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:19,250
Oh, my God! You look like
the Fourth of July!

326
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:22,617
Makes me want a hot dog
real bad.

327
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,978
Yeah, OK.
You got to get going, honey.

328
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,156
OK.

329
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:30,490
- Elle, look at this.
- What's that?

330
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,443
According to
"Animal Fair" magazine...

331
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:35,258
your new boss is the best
groomed woman in Washington.

332
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:37,626
Her beagle's name
is Dolly Madison...

333
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,989
which is my grandma's
stripper name.

334
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:42,747
Isn't that a good sign?

335
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:44,440
Oh, my gosh. A job with
a brilliant congresswoman...

336
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,788
who's also
a fellow Harvard alum.

337
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:48,890
You'll do great, Elle.
It's destiny.

338
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,000
But isn't planning
the wedding of the century...

339
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:54,040
and changing the law
kind of hard?

340
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,600
Paulette, I taught Bruiser
how to shop online.

341
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:59,522
I think I can handle Congress.

342
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,887
See ya.

343
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,680
Home sweet home. You ready?

344
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,088
OK.

345
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,528
Welcome to
the Wellington, ma'am.

346
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,570
It's a thrill to be here!

347
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:05,797
Time to legislate!

348
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,328
No.

349
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,951
Too Nancy.

350
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,196
Too Hillary.

351
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:19,949
Too Monica.

352
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:22,670
Too perfect for words!

353
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,001
Hi!

354
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,720
Good morning,
fellow public servants.

355
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,480
It's my first day.

356
00:18:38,838 --> 00:18:39,952
Nice briefcase.

357
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:42,446
Huh? Thank you.

358
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,449
Hi!

359
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:54,931
Last item on
our agenda--Elle Woods.

360
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,944
Personal Rudd hire,
taking up a bill...

361
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:59,637
on animal testing
in the cosmetic industry.

362
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,367
I'm sorry,
Rudd's backing that?

363
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:02,865
Matter of conscience,
whatever.

364
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,559
Who knows? Maybe it'll boost
our female demographic.

365
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,451
The point is
we're animal lovers now.

366
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:11,196
If this is so important to Rudd,
shouldn't I be handling it?

367
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:13,980
No, Timothy,
not when we have a woman...

368
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,902
who according to Rudd,
is one of the shrewdest...

369
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,073
legal and political minds
of our time.

370
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,324
Hello, patriots!

371
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:24,800
I don't think
I've been this excited...

372
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,970
since Gucci became
a publicly traded company.

373
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,456
Oh, my God,
it's Capitol Barbie.

374
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:32,570
She's so shiny.

375
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,465
So where should I start?

376
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,935
Excuse me, sweetie?

377
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:39,451
Intern orientation
is down the hall in Room 216.

378
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:43,102
That's before 217 and after 215.

379
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:45,377
Oh, my God!
That is so sweet of you!

380
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,168
You think I'm an intern?

381
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:50,053
That anti-wrinkle
all-salmon diet really works.

382
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,263
Who are you?

383
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:55,711
- I'm sorry--
- Elle Woods, welcome!

384
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:58,239
I haven't seen you
since the alumni meeting!

385
00:19:58,312 --> 00:20:01,412
- I know! How are you?
- Good!

386
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:03,391
This is Elle Woods, everyone.

387
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:06,596
Basically me
when I first came to D. C...

388
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,630
so make her feel at home.

389
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,199
You ready to hit
the ground running?

390
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:13,217
Are these not
my comfortable heels?

391
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:17,187
- Cute shoes.
- Thank you. They are comfy.

392
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:20,866
Here's Bruiser. Welcome.

393
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:25,350
Oh, you little sugar!

394
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,079
Back her up, people.

395
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:29,900
This is the most collaborative
bunch on the Hill...

396
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,528
So gather them together...

397
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,486
talk strategy as soon as
you get settled in.

398
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:35,044
- And, Elle?
- Yes?

399
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:38,021
- Welcome to Washington.
- Thank you!

400
00:20:38,094 --> 00:20:40,909
Okey-dokey.

401
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:43,758
I missed the part about
where my office is.

402
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:46,542
The desk. Right here.

403
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,978
All righty. Then I'm going
to need a glue gun...

404
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:56,971
some pinking shears, and
five yards of grosgrain ribbon.

405
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,953
Yeah, that'll do it.

406
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,178
Well, look at you.

407
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:06,156
You can run your wedding
coordinator business...

408
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,987
during all that
legislative downtime.

409
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,484
Don't be silly, Grace.

410
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,697
This is to plan
my own wedding to Emmett.

411
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,319
See, this is us.
He had this made for me.

412
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,426
That's him,
and that's me smiling.

413
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:18,806
Maybe he'll make one
of you and me.

414
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:20,564
You'll be talking
and I'll be throwing up.

415
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:23,001
Speaking of nuptials,
wait till I tell...

416
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,659
the congresswoman
that I was invited...

417
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,586
to John McCain's
nephew's wedding.

418
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,439
He's really quite a sweet kid.

419
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:30,032
Tell me something, Timothy...

420
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,561
is it difficult for you
to breathe with...

421
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:34,708
your mouth flat
against your employer's butt?

422
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,301
I don't know, Grace.
Is it difficult to see...

423
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:39,346
with your head in
the Minority Whip's lap?

424
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,560
It was the distinguished
gentlemen from Iowa.

425
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:44,182
His wife had recently left him
and we just talked.

426
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:47,100
Right. Because if
you did "visit" his district...

427
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,502
you should've gotten
some legislation out of it.

428
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:50,647
How would you even know...

429
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:53,087
when you're busy chasing
interns on a skateboard?

430
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:55,900
Excuse me? Who wants
to talk animal testing?

431
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,237
Write a bill, Britney.
I don't have a car!

432
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,312
Snap Cup time

433
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:07,583
Gather ye round

434
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,335
Friends and foes together

435
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,738
United and bound

436
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:15,041
Pass it to your neighbor

437
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,148
Instead of blowing up

438
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,360
And we'll find
harmony and love

439
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,601
In the Snap Cup!

440
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:25,381
Don't tell me you don't know
what a Snap Cup is?

441
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,061
OK, I'll explain it.

442
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:32,226
You are going to write down
an anonymous praise note...

443
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:34,150
on a little warm fuzzy.

444
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:35,329
Warm fuzzy?

445
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,774
Yes. Compliments
about your co-workers.

446
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,052
Just something nice.

447
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:41,351
Then you deposit them
in the sacred vessel.

448
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:44,735
The Snap Cup is essential to
any bipartisan environment.

449
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:46,600
Consider 1998 Spring Carnival.

450
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,569
The Delta Nus partnered
with the Kappa Kappa Gammas...

451
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:52,393
on Project Kissing Booth.
Big problems.

452
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,605
Go ahead, write.

453
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,816
So, a whole heated
debate transpired...

454
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:57,860
over the whole
tongue-no tongue policy.

455
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,690
I think you know what side
the Kappas were on.

456
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:02,573
Anyway, it really helped us
move past the conflict...

457
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:04,068
and I think
it can help us today.

458
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:07,372
Let's just try this, OK?

459
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:09,676
Thank you, Reena. Thank you.

460
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:10,889
Thanks for that.

461
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,967
Thank you, Timothy.

462
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:20,304
So now, the Snap Cup
mistress--me--recites.

463
00:23:21,297 --> 00:23:23,022
Good, I got mine.

464
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:27,471
"Grace always has the confidence
to speak her mind.

465
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,476
"Plus, she looks terrific
in charcoal."

466
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,850
And, voilà, snaps for Grace!

467
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:35,765
You see? Our first Snap Cup!

468
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,573
This is so exciting!
I wonder what'll happen next?

469
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:42,486
All right, this is...

470
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:46,829
"What do Elle Woods and
the Snap Cup have in common?"

471
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:49,042
A riddle. That's so cool.

472
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:50,574
I love riddles.

473
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,367
"They're both..."

474
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:58,449
"stupid."

475
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,179
Enough already.

476
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:02,934
Maybe we can do something
actually worthwhile...

477
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:04,378
like attend the hearing
of the committee...

478
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,615
you need to crack.
I'll take you myself.

479
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:10,482
Thank you, Grace.
That's very generous of you.

480
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:13,788
See, I think
the Snap Cup really works.

481
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:17,911
Wow.

482
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:20,154
Good morning.

483
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:23,191
This is just like on C-SPAN
except I'm not bored.

484
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:24,541
You're in the wrong room,
sweetheart.

485
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:26,428
Intern orientation
is in room...

486
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:29,563
216? Yes, I've heard.
Thank you.

487
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:36,957
Hi, I'm Elle Woods.
I'm not an intern.

488
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:38,457
Rob Cole. Me, neither.

489
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:40,953
I'm the new legislative aide
to Congresswoman Rudd.

490
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:42,968
I'm an old congressman
from Delaware.

491
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:46,393
I've been to Delaware!
No sales tax. Good one, sir.

492
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:49,698
Committee is called to order.

493
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,356
Welcome to
the special meeting of the...

494
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:56,838
Excuse me. Sorry.

495
00:24:56,903 --> 00:24:59,454
Committee
of Energy and Commerce.

496
00:24:59,525 --> 00:25:03,204
Before we turn
to our official agenda...

497
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,279
are there
any introductory remarks?

498
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:06,946
Madam chairwoman...

499
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:08,773
Grace Rossiter,
chief of staff...

500
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,565
Representative Rudd,
Massachusetts.

501
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,326
As our newest
legislative assistant...

502
00:25:12,395 --> 00:25:15,906
will be spearheading a campaign
under your committee...

503
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:17,637
I'm sure she'd love the floor.

504
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:21,799
Thus I yield to my colleague,
the lady in hot pink.

505
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,357
You have the floor,
lady in hot pink.

506
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,836
Me?

507
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,612
Would you care to more
specifically identify yourself?

508
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,204
Oh, sure!

509
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:34,343
My name is Elle Woods,
Boston by way of Bel Air.

510
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:36,104
And as my surname
would suggest...

511
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:38,694
I am a passionate advocate
for everything in nature...

512
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:39,880
and a contented citizen...

513
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,406
until my shorthaired
Chihuahua, Bruiser...

514
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:45,548
brought me face-to-face with
the animal testing issue.

515
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,958
You're out of order,
Miss Woods.

516
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,163
This is
a fuel efficiency hearing.

517
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,786
I don't see anything in
the agenda about animal testing.

518
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:52,938
Will you yield the floor?

519
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,472
Absolutely. I'm almost done.

520
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,970
So, in conclusion,
I just want to say...

521
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:58,320
that I am so excited
about the day...

522
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,430
that I get to march up
those grand Capitol steps...

523
00:26:00,502 --> 00:26:04,012
and drop
that very bill in the...

524
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,644
What's it called?

525
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:08,564
It's like a shiny,
mahogany box thing?

526
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:09,709
The hopper.

527
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:12,532
Exactly! The hopper!
How could I forget?

528
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,868
It's like a bunny.
Perfect for animal testing.

529
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:16,757
And I want
to let everybody know...

530
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:19,060
that I'm having
a post-hopper tapas party.

531
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:22,063
I'm making sangria.
It's really yummy.

532
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:25,137
My, my, how very interesting
that all sounds.

533
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,282
It'll be fun.

534
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,013
However, the next time
you consider...

535
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:33,655
attending a hearing
over which I preside... don't!

536
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:38,612
Committee is called to order.

537
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:39,893
OK.

538
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:41,971
Welcome to the special meeting
of the Committee...

539
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:44,697
of Energy and Commerce.
For the record...

540
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:46,522
would the secretary
please make note that...

541
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:49,973
Welcome to the Wellington,
ma'am.

542
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,203
Seventeen-B?

543
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,657
You have a package.

544
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,704
Inside that box are the most
perfect wedding shoes ever.

545
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:09,339
Both visually stunning
and cleated.

546
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,620
And I won't be able
to wear them...

547
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,381
since I obviously
won't make the date...

548
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,945
for Emmett's fantasy
baseball wedding...

549
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:15,361
given that I don't have
a chance of getting...

550
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,665
those important congresspeople
to co-sponsor my bill...

551
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:20,833
which I need to get a hearing
to stop animal testing...

552
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:22,363
in order to reunite Bruiser
with his mother...

553
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:23,997
in order to have them
at my wedding...

554
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:25,180
in which
I was going to wear...

555
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:27,742
the most perfect
wedding shoes ever...

556
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,181
right inside that box.

557
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:34,109
They never covered this
in the handbook.

558
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:42,053
They're something, all right.

559
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,062
You think?

560
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,811
Oh, I'm sorry.

561
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,095
Elle Woods,
legislative aide...

562
00:27:53,164 --> 00:27:55,585
to Congresswoman Rudd,
Massachusetts.

563
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,529
Sid Post. Doorman.

564
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:01,387
That door.

565
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:04,453
All day I've felt like white,
open-toed shoes after Labor Day.

566
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,599
I hate that feeling.

567
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,454
Whatever that means.

568
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,928
I better get going.
If I'm going to pass a law...

569
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,074
I have to work up
some plan of attack...

570
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:20,422
with the Committee
of En and Ron or whatever.

571
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:22,472
Bye, Sid.

572
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:26,027
- Comm.
- What'd you say?

573
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:29,711
It's called the Committee
of Energy and Commerce.

574
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,641
Oh, yeah. Right. Thanks.

575
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,402
This is really
important to me, Grace.

576
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:46,194
They wouldn't cover
my nana's anti-itch cream...

577
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:48,849
which means she only has
one free hand for bingo.

578
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,636
- Lf I could get a hearing--
- Where's your bill, Reena?

579
00:28:51,703 --> 00:28:53,843
The staff lawyers couldn't
draft it for six weeks...

580
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:55,702
but if you could talk to
the congressman's aide...

581
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,461
I could get on the agenda.

582
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,668
We pushed
prescription drugs last term.

583
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:02,640
I have a lot of issues
that come first.

584
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:06,707
Reena, if Grace finds herself
otherwise prioritized...

585
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,754
maybe you could talk
to this aide yourself.

586
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:11,315
Or better yet,
directly to the congressman.

587
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:15,284
Don't you have something
to alphabetize?

588
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:18,586
In fact,
now that I think about it...

589
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:20,890
with Reena's clear passion
for the project...

590
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:22,550
who better to
write this bill than Reena?

591
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:23,931
Me?

592
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,308
It's like I always say--

593
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,961
Why let someone else do for you
what you can do for yourself?

594
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:29,756
Except in the case
of eyebrow maintenance.

595
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:31,800
We always say follow protocol.

596
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,215
It's worked
for the past 200 years...

597
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,168
OK, Miss Snap Cup?

598
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:39,325
Stick it out with the lawyers.
They'll get to you eventually.

599
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:42,208
This is the new
congressmember roster.

600
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:49,087
Just a dollar.

601
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:50,879
Don't you believe
in helping a guy out?

602
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:52,159
What I do believe in, sir...

603
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:54,235
is an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay.

604
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:55,770
Not rewards for idleness.

605
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:57,371
- 50 cents?
- Leave me!

606
00:29:57,444 --> 00:29:59,387
- Just a quarter.
- Go bother someone else!

607
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:06,339
People here
have no common courtesy.

608
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:08,796
Want to get a hearing
for your bill?

609
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:11,773
Get Congresswoman Hauser.
She needs a political makeover.

610
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:14,182
Sidney?

611
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,485
Who needs a what?

612
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:20,483
Hauser.
Tough redhead on En and Comm.

613
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:23,685
If she can put her name
on something warm and fuzzy...

614
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:28,775
something like puppies,
that could do the trick.

615
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,714
Really? What if I showed
Hauser the photos...

616
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,284
of what they're doing
to these animals?

617
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:38,216
That'd work...
with someone with a heart.

618
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:41,516
Hauser responds to facts,
figures, and demographics.

619
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,525
You gotta do your homework.

620
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,771
How did you learn all this?

621
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,564
I have been stationed
on the forefront...

622
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:50,122
of all major political
and social scandals...

623
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:52,169
for the past 30 years.

624
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:54,216
You worked in the White House?

625
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,040
No, at the Wellington.

626
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,375
After Hauser,
you'll need Stanford Marks...

627
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,680
Alabama Republican.
A real hard-ass.

628
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:03,056
Sidney, you are,
without a doubt...

629
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:05,971
the most useful person
I've met in Washington.

630
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:44,436
Hauser's margin
in the last election?

631
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:45,752
Four points. 52-48.

632
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,899
Hauser's chief?

633
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,592
Hall, Ted.
34, moderate, tough.

634
00:31:49,662 --> 00:31:52,412
- Marks' aide?
- Murphy. Conservative, tougher.

635
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,414
- I think you're ready.
- Thank you, Sid.

636
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:59,453
For shizzle... my ezzle.

637
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,719
I borrowed this.

638
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:15,233
Excuse me!

639
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:16,826
Given the historical
tendencies...

640
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:18,209
of the congresswoman's
voting pool...

641
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:21,026
animal testing is the very issue
your platform needs.

642
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,100
Which brings me to my
demographic breakdown target.

643
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:26,108
Which brings us to the end
of our time, but good stuff.

644
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:27,358
I'll bat it around
with my colleagues.

645
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:29,054
I'm not done
with my presentation.

646
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,533
- Is Friday good?
- Absolutely.

647
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,373
The second one in November,
and the line starts down there.

648
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:37,190
But wait!
I won't be here in November.

649
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:38,630
I'm getting married.

650
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:41,474
If you insist Congressman Marks
is unavailable...

651
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:42,624
perhaps you could look at...

652
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,967
my alternative testing
economics incentive chart.

653
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:48,639
But it's pop-up.

654
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:53,415
I will read this homeowners
legislation this weekend.

655
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:55,687
Five more minutes and
I'm due in committee. Reena.

656
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:56,867
Well--

657
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:59,078
Reena's prescription drugs
for the elderly amendment--

658
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:00,576
rejected during mark-up session.

659
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:01,896
Sorry, Nana.

660
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:05,227
- Where are we with the animals?
- Still not on the calendar.

661
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:07,660
So we're nowhere.
Grace, help Elle with this.

662
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:10,826
Let's get going.
I'll see you all later.

663
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:13,196
Grace...

664
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:15,631
I think I can get a meeting
with Hauser's aide.

665
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:17,802
Please.
You could have 100 meetings...

666
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,246
and it still wouldn't matter.

667
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:20,970
This is Washington politics...

668
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,310
not warm fuzzies
and kissing booths.

669
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,613
It takes savvy
and street smarts.

670
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:28,779
I've seen thousands of
polite, idealistic girls...

671
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:31,599
just like you traipse
up and down this Hill...

672
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:35,377
and go home empty-handed
with blisters on their feet.

673
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:38,706
Thank you, Grace.

674
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:41,971
You actually reminded me
of something really important.

675
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:44,404
I came here
to give my dog a voice...

676
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:46,706
and I'd forgotten about my own.

677
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:49,740
So you can do it
the Washington way.

678
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:54,191
But I'm going to do it
the Elle Woods way.

679
00:33:54,263 --> 00:33:54,359
Time to get serious.

680
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,734
Time to get serious.

681
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,321
Subject--Congresswoman
Libby Hauser.

682
00:33:58,393 --> 00:33:59,734
Came of age in Post-War boom...

683
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,063
typified by 1951
Charles Jourdan stiletto heel.

684
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,748
Moving up to the Texan's head,
which is red...

685
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:08,537
suspect chemical assistance.
Must pursue.

686
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,098
Hit me, Post.

687
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:12,626
118 salons within
a 10-mile radius...

688
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,771
broken down
by color expertise...

689
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:19,995
and philosophical approach
to hair maintenance and style.

690
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:22,909
I didn't know you could have
a philosophy of hair.

691
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:24,219
Oh, yeah.

692
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:26,491
Maybe that's where I went wrong.

693
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,145
Go for Woods.

694
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:30,906
It's just as you suspected.

695
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:33,015
She's at a moderate
conservative salon...

696
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,422
founded on
the principles of Vidal.

697
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:38,359
In fact, it was one
of our case studies...

698
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,506
last year at Hair University.

699
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,716
That was right
before they flunked me.

700
00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:44,989
Paulette, they weren't ready
for your vision.

701
00:34:45,057 --> 00:34:47,578
I know you'll make
your mark hair-wise.

702
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:50,113
Sorry.

703
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:52,449
- You got a pen?
- Yes.

704
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:54,621
It's at Constitution and 12th.

705
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,150
The Salon Bontempo.

706
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,463
Don't you just love a salon day?

707
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:08,670
Yes, so peaceful and quiet.

708
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:10,946
Makes it so much easier
to talk that way.

709
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:12,511
They have rules about that here.

710
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:15,105
I know. That's why
I called to make sure...

711
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:16,964
they used PETA-approved
hair care products.

712
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,105
When you think about what
they do to those animals--

713
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:21,151
Which is why
I don't think about it.

714
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:22,785
Does the trick.

715
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:27,880
Excellent bobby pin handling.

716
00:35:27,946 --> 00:35:30,819
Thank you, Frederic.
Looks great.

717
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,888
Isn't it
so comforting to see...

718
00:35:34,957 --> 00:35:36,867
they use eco-friendly
foil technology here?

719
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,429
Every planet needs a friend,
that's what I always say.

720
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:42,219
If I wanted to talk about
the emotional life of a rock...

721
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:45,005
you'd know it by now.

722
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:47,406
Until this day,
I'd held the highest opinion...

723
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:50,057
of redheads as a fellow
hair minority group.

724
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,202
I heard quite enough
of your politics...

725
00:35:52,273 --> 00:35:54,312
at the committee meeting,
thank you very much.

726
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:14,442
When was the last time you wore
the yellow tea rose?

727
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:23,794
I'm sorry?
What did you just--

728
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:26,198
When was the last time
you wore your yellow tea rose?

729
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,404
On the night of my initiation.

730
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:30,578
Wasn't the passing of the secret
scented eternal flame...

731
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,137
of the goddess Delta Nu
not the most moving experience?

732
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:35,151
Especially the part
where we sipped...

733
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:37,778
from the secret
pink chalice of sisterhood!

734
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:39,507
Yes!

735
00:36:43,707 --> 00:36:45,781
Delta who?

736
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,925
Delta Nu!

737
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,097
Delta-Delta boo-gah-loo

738
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,685
Nu Nu Delta

739
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,035
Theta, Beta

740
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:56,445
Lambda, Mu

741
00:36:56,511 --> 00:36:59,958
Ooh-aah, Delta Nu!

742
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,472
Libby Hauser, Texas.
Planning a wedding?

743
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,327
That "I do" updo
looks like heaven on you.

744
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,504
Thank you.

745
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,998
Who is he?
Zeta Lambda Nu, I hope.

746
00:37:11,073 --> 00:37:13,081
Actually, I'm marrying
outside the Greek system...

747
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:14,811
but he's totally letter-worthy.

748
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:19,139
But how is D.C. Elle-worthy?

749
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,625
I'm here to speak for those
who can't speak for themselves.

750
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,589
How interesting.

751
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:25,855
It's more than interesting.
It's practical.

752
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:28,194
Strictly a numbers game
as far as you're concerned.

753
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:33,630
125,468--Number of people in
your district with dog licenses.

754
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:37,477
12,762--The number of
unemployed scientists...

755
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:40,358
with the skills to develop
alternatives to animal testing.

756
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:44,897
And finally, 6285--the ID number
of my dog's captive mother.

757
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:47,968
I'm not sure
I followed all that...

758
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,470
but you got my attention.

759
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:51,072
If there's one thing
I know how to do...

760
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:53,151
it's rinse and repeat.
Shall we?

761
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:56,164
Excuse me,
do you happen to have a--

762
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,143
- Get lost!
- Excuse me, sir!

763
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:01,417
- Do you have a--
- No, I'm busy.

764
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:03,339
Sir, could I use a section
of your newspaper?

765
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:05,379
We're late for
your doggie spa appointment.

766
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:12,259
- Here you go.
- Thank you, young lady.

767
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,309
No problem. What kind
of world would this be...

768
00:38:14,382 --> 00:38:16,750
if we didn't help each other out
every once in a while?

769
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:19,182
Have a good day.

770
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:20,841
What do you want, Bruiser?

771
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:27,758
Bruiser, honey, come on.

772
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:37,260
We have to go. We're late.

773
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,100
We have to get to
the doggie spa, remember?

774
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:44,469
Will it be Swedish
or shiatsu massage today?

775
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:46,422
Come on.

776
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:52,394
Come on. We gotta get you
to the puppy pretty parlor.

777
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:56,396
Redhead, down.

778
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,446
Up next is Stanford Marks...

779
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,006
Southern conservative,
NRA spokesman.

780
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:03,055
How about tulips?

781
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:06,741
No, no, the calla lily
is this year's tulip.

782
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:09,560
- For weddings?
- It's all about the calla.

783
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:11,569
What would I do without you?

784
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:13,912
I couldn't do anything
without you, Sid.

785
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:16,597
You're going to get
this bill through, Elle.

786
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:20,597
An honest voice
is louder than a crowd's.

787
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:22,644
Just trust your voice.

788
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:31,034
Bruiser? Oh, my God.
I'll be right back.

789
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:31,232
Pilates for Poodles?
That's Tuesday at 2:30.

790
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:33,980
Pilates for Poodles?
That's Tuesday at 2:30.

791
00:39:35,743 --> 00:39:37,206
- The page said it was urgent!
- They said it was urgent.

792
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,068
- Please tell me he's OK.
- What's wrong with Leslie?

793
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:40,860
We have it under control now...

794
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:42,815
but your Rottweiler
has been humping...

795
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,500
your little dog,
and vice versa.

796
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,124
Your Chihuahua's quite
the little leaper, young lady.

797
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:50,081
Takes a running start.

798
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:53,377
Hell, what can I say?
My Rottweiler's a stallion.

799
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:56,477
In our household, we fully
support a healthy curiosity.

800
00:39:56,548 --> 00:40:01,121
Testosterone is natural.
Wait. Did you say stallion?

801
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:03,099
Wait a minute. Your dog...

802
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:05,182
the one wearing that ridiculous
pink skirt in the park?

803
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:07,262
Why would she have testosterone?

804
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:08,959
That wasn't a skirt,
it was a skort.

805
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,753
- Men wear skorts.
- Uh-huh.

806
00:40:10,821 --> 00:40:12,448
What the heck is a skort?

807
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,375
And what does a man wearing one
got to do with it?

808
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,802
All right! Leslie is a Les.
The Rottweiler is a guy...

809
00:40:20,872 --> 00:40:26,090
and Bruiser is a male dog
who enjoys wearing pastel.

810
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:29,155
The canines are both male.

811
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,610
Your dogs are gay.

812
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:50,539
All the signs were there.
I just didn't see them.

813
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,747
Most dogs
like to chew your shoes...

814
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:56,076
and Bruiser liked to wear mine.

815
00:40:56,142 --> 00:40:59,244
I just thought
he liked the height.

816
00:40:59,314 --> 00:41:00,492
You just want
what's best for them.

817
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:01,937
Doesn't matter
if they're the smartest...

818
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,685
or the strongest
or the best diggers.

819
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,690
As long as they're happy.

820
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:10,511
Why me? Why my dog?

821
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:13,230
I told Doris not
to buy it in Dupont Circle.

822
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:17,262
That damn homosexual
puppy boutique.

823
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:20,181
Stanford Marks, by the way.
You can call me Stan.

824
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,969
Elle Woods.
Very nice to meet you.

825
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:24,308
You're the girl with
the perfumed poo baggies.

826
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,341
I'm the woman with
the scented waste receptacles.

827
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:30,831
Wait!
Congressman Stanford Marks?

828
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:32,178
As in the Southern
conservative...

829
00:41:32,246 --> 00:41:34,549
NRA spokesman Alabama
Republican Stanford Marks?

830
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:35,861
One and the same.

831
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,139
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

832
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,211
No, Congressman,
the pleasure is all mine.

833
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:42,737
- Well...
- Believe me.

834
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,626
Here's to getting things
done the Washington way.

835
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:47,928
Your chief of staff
has just gotten herself...

836
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:51,127
a meeting with--wait for it--
Chairman Stan Marks...

837
00:41:51,196 --> 00:41:53,106
in just four short weeks.

838
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:55,931
- Congratulations, Grace.
- Yes!

839
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,077
Oh, yes.
OK, who wants to bet...

840
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:02,906
over-under
on Ms. Woods departure?

841
00:42:02,974 --> 00:42:04,468
Right now it's at six days.

842
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:05,182
- Reena?
- No, thanks.

843
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:06,427
- Reena?
- No, thanks.

844
00:42:06,495 --> 00:42:08,055
Come on. Anybody?

845
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:09,371
Who wants to take
over six days?

846
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,001
I'll take it, Grace.

847
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:13,179
I've been so busy.
I'm sorry I'm late.

848
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,158
Reena, could you be a pal
and just tell me...

849
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,142
what I'm doing
a week from tomorrow?

850
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:19,324
By the way, that outfit
looks fantastic on you.

851
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:21,151
It really brings out
the color in your eyes.

852
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,075
Thanks.

853
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,659
It's on my "I brake for
sample sales" bookmark.

854
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:30,938
9:00--sample custom color
wedding cake frosting.

855
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:33,051
10:00--
rehearse hearing speech.

856
00:42:33,123 --> 00:42:34,751
11:00--
Commerce committee hearing.

857
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:36,961
12:00--
exfoliating treatment--

858
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,682
Go back to that one at 11:00.

859
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:43,067
11:00--
Commerce committee hearing.

860
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,485
That's what it says.

861
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:46,111
I'm going to be appearing
before ranking member...

862
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:47,709
Libby Hauser,
Chairman Stanford Marks...

863
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:49,344
and the entire Committee
of En and Comm.

864
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:52,036
A hop, skip, and a jump
away from a floor vote.

865
00:42:52,106 --> 00:42:53,633
Nice try, but you
have to get a bill...

866
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,047
before you have a hearing.

867
00:42:55,113 --> 00:42:56,675
Like this one?

868
00:42:56,747 --> 00:42:58,689
It's like I was saying
to the congresswoman...

869
00:42:58,763 --> 00:43:00,485
the other day over
caramel macchiatos.

870
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:02,726
"Is bill writing
super fun or what?"

871
00:43:02,794 --> 00:43:04,517
I think so.

872
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:07,656
Where is that Elle Woods?

873
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:10,573
Oh, my God.

874
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:13,485
- Libby just told me the news.
- She did?

875
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,826
Never underestimate a woman...

876
00:43:14,894 --> 00:43:16,682
with a French manicure
and a Harvard law degree.

877
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,638
Thank you, Victoria.
That's very sweet of you...

878
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:21,515
but I couldn't have done it
without your inspiration.

879
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,265
I'm honored.
This girl is special.

880
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,988
Actually, I didn't do it alone.

881
00:43:27,057 --> 00:43:30,220
The entire team helped me.
It was really a group effort.

882
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:32,711
Good work, guys.
Really good work.

883
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:34,793
- You.
- Thanks.

884
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:38,281
Thank you, Reena.
You're a sweetheart.

885
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:41,488
And I guess I will see you
at the hopper.

886
00:44:15,675 --> 00:44:17,529
Ask not what your best friend
can do for man...

887
00:44:17,595 --> 00:44:20,213
but what you can do
for man's best friend.

888
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:26,584
The Committee
on Energy and Commerce...

889
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:28,311
will now come to order.

890
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:32,124
HR 2562,
aka Bruiser's Bill--

891
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:34,491
Representative
Victoria Rudd, sponsor...

892
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,413
proposing a ban
on animal testing...

893
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:38,487
in the cosmetics industry.

894
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:39,934
I'd like to welcome
you all today as we begin...

895
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,040
consideration of
this very important issue.

896
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,795
This week, you will hear
testimony from both sides...

897
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:49,088
and I ask that you keep
your ears and your minds open.

898
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,041
This is my first
congressional hearing.

899
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,765
Can you believe it?

900
00:44:52,835 --> 00:44:54,144
And so I come to you today
as a citizen...

901
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,448
and a scientist with
the National Institute of Health

902
00:44:56,515 --> 00:44:58,904
for 25 years,
during which time...

903
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:01,346
it's become increasingly clear
that these supposed alternatives

904
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:04,512
to animal testing
aren't alternatives at all.

905
00:45:04,581 --> 00:45:08,356
I took this office to represent
my two-legged constituents.

906
00:45:08,421 --> 00:45:12,196
Recently, I saw an item in
a pet store with the label...

907
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:14,847
"This product
is tested on humans."

908
00:45:14,918 --> 00:45:16,742
That's a problem
worth discussing.

909
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,342
All the bleeding hearts...

910
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:24,003
will try to distract us
from the facts...

911
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:27,009
with their saccharine talk
of wagging tails...

912
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:30,530
cold noses, and other
sentimental mumbo jumbo.

913
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,503
Consider this--where we see
softness of heart...

914
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:36,101
we often see softness of mind.

915
00:45:36,172 --> 00:45:38,822
And so to move on such a bill
at this juncture in time...

916
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:41,128
would wreak havoc
on already unstable...

917
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,946
local economies
across the country.

918
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:46,500
Now, that's a problem
worth discussing.

919
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:50,182
You know
I'd do anything for you...

920
00:45:50,253 --> 00:45:52,111
but I got to tell you,
that is one tough room.

921
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:54,250
- Better be prepared tomorrow.
- All right.

922
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,655
Excuse me, ladies.
Good evening.

923
00:45:56,721 --> 00:46:00,070
I know you've had
a bad day in court before.

924
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:01,323
It's the same thing.

925
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:03,368
They make their case,
we make ours.

926
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:04,815
Yes, but that was bad.

927
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,143
They're mostly posturing for
their constituents back home.

928
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:09,934
I think we have the votes
in committee...

929
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:11,661
even without your testimony.

930
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:15,344
But they have scientists
and economists and facts.

931
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:18,446
So do we.
Elle, listen to me.

932
00:46:18,516 --> 00:46:21,711
Go home.
Have an early evening.

933
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,723
Sorry.

934
00:46:23,796 --> 00:46:26,581
Victoria Rudd. Yes.

935
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:29,330
Hang on one minute, will you?

936
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,116
Go home. Try to relax.

937
00:46:32,183 --> 00:46:35,893
And don't think like them.
Think like you.

938
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,228
OK. Thanks.

939
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,303
- Good night.
- Good night.

940
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:43,984
Bob, how are you?

941
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,385
I'm leaving the Capitol
right now.

942
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:53,273
- Thanks. Nice work.
- Oh.

943
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:58,868
Sid?

944
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,257
I'm sorry about that.
This happens all the time.

945
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,861
My break is almost up...

946
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,382
but I wanted to get you this
before tomorrow.

947
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:08,949
Great. Let's walk.

948
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:12,253
Sidney, this is brilliant.

949
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,296
How did you know all this?

950
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:17,785
Hundreds of dogs walked and
thousands of plastic baggies.

951
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:20,575
This is perfect.
This is exactly what I need.

952
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,218
Well, of course
I appreciate your support.

953
00:47:25,282 --> 00:47:26,622
Why wouldn't it continue?

954
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:29,691
I'm already on record
on that issue.

955
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:36,667
All right.

956
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,496
I'll do what I can.

957
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,898
Don't push me, Bob.

958
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:42,754
I'll do what I can.

959
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:45,059
All right. Good night.

960
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:52,966
- I need to call in my favor.
- I'm listening.

961
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:56,327
I've changed my position
on Bruiser's Bill.

962
00:47:56,392 --> 00:47:59,360
A man who controls
a political machine...

963
00:47:59,432 --> 00:48:02,598
Boy, he's good.
He is really good.

964
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,324
I'm really glad
we're watching this.

965
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:05,988
This is good for you.

966
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:07,204
He promised to break me in two.

967
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:08,584
I'm starting
to worry about...

968
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:10,342
getting all
this wedding planning done.

969
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:13,673
Elle, I want you to follow
my lead in Washington.

970
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,674
And always make sure
Bruiser wears a sweater.

971
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:19,915
- Is that Sean Connery?
- No, it's not.

972
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:21,411
Powerful enough
to control congressmen...

973
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:23,908
Seriously, honey, don't worry
about the wedding research.

974
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:26,219
Just give 'em hell tomorrow.

975
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:44,880
The chair now recognizes
legislative aide Elle Woods.

976
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:53,389
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

977
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:55,054
There she is!

978
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:57,460
Guys, she really did it.

979
00:48:58,678 --> 00:48:59,889
Miss Woods?

980
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:01,617
Well, I'll be damned.

981
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:04,175
Representative Kroft...

982
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:06,637
that lip gloss looks absolutely
sensational on you.

983
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:09,069
I'm sorry, what?

984
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:11,479
It's Raspberry Macaroon
number 156.

985
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:13,455
Company shall remain nameless,
is that correct?

986
00:49:13,529 --> 00:49:17,839
Well, yes. But how did you--

987
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,539
What if I told you,
Representative Kroft...

988
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:21,585
that you owe that
special bounce in your step...

989
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:24,276
that only comes from finding
the perfect lipstick...

990
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:28,177
to the pain and suffering
of innocent animals?

991
00:49:28,252 --> 00:49:29,626
What if I was to tell you...

992
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:31,635
Congresswoman
Madeline Melanie Kroft...

993
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,947
that you owe
your Raspberry Macaroon...

994
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,254
to him?

995
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,822
My best friend.

996
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:46,843
Bruiser.

997
00:49:46,912 --> 00:49:49,815
How many times
has he acted on my behalf?

998
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:52,059
Countless.

999
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:57,247
But today, I get the opportunity
to speak for him.

1000
00:49:57,314 --> 00:50:00,130
Who do you speak for?

1001
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,074
Congressman Fuchs...

1002
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:10,685
the next time you reach for your
overnight moisturizing gloves--

1003
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:12,349
By the way, it's nothing
to be ashamed about.

1004
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,462
More men should use them.

1005
00:50:14,534 --> 00:50:18,463
Consider asking yourself what
you're willing to sacrifice...

1006
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:21,057
in the name of
beauty and soft cuticles.

1007
00:50:21,129 --> 00:50:24,576
Are you willing to sacrifice
animal welfare?

1008
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:27,201
Or how about
the welfare of one animal?

1009
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:29,825
Like Jelly,
your childhood pal...

1010
00:50:29,897 --> 00:50:32,932
that striking
retriever-black lab mix.

1011
00:50:35,018 --> 00:50:38,532
You know about Jelly?

1012
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,602
When all the other children
refused to play Lone Ranger...

1013
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:43,813
who was it that was
always your Tonto?

1014
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:46,306
Jelly Belly.

1015
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:59,790
Mr. Chairman...

1016
00:50:59,855 --> 00:51:01,863
when you look in those
snap-worthy almond eyes...

1017
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,114
of your Rottweiler Leslie...

1018
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:05,834
does it not make your heart
glow with warmth?

1019
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:08,874
With due respect, Ms. Woods,
I wouldn't go that far.

1020
00:51:08,945 --> 00:51:10,406
But when he learned
to differentiate...

1021
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:12,204
between seven different
kinds of pipes...

1022
00:51:12,273 --> 00:51:14,510
and fetch each one on command,
did you not swear...

1023
00:51:14,577 --> 00:51:16,617
to protect him
with every shotgun...

1024
00:51:16,689 --> 00:51:20,653
in your charming little
ammunitions case?

1025
00:51:20,724 --> 00:51:22,001
It wouldn't come to that.

1026
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:25,202
This is a dog
we're talking about.

1027
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,374
But if you could speak
for Leslie...

1028
00:51:27,445 --> 00:51:29,452
what would you say?

1029
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:38,864
What would Leslie want you
to say for him, Mr. Chairman?

1030
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,055
Stan.

1031
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:54,868
To hell with it.

1032
00:51:56,189 --> 00:51:59,504
My Rottweiler Les is
of the homosexual orientation.

1033
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:03,192
I've said it. I'm out.

1034
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:05,595
My name is Stan Marks,
I'm a conservative Republican...

1035
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:07,635
NRA spokesman,
and my dog is gay.

1036
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,883
And guess what?

1037
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:12,919
I couldn't be prouder
of the little flamer!

1038
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:15,195
I don't care
how good my hair looks...

1039
00:52:15,263 --> 00:52:17,368
slicked back with
some high-dollar pomade.

1040
00:52:17,439 --> 00:52:21,116
Just one long stare into
that sweet sissy dog's eyes...

1041
00:52:21,184 --> 00:52:26,042
and I know no cosmetic
could ever be worth it!

1042
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:30,370
Bruiser's Bill.

1043
00:52:30,434 --> 00:52:32,091
Bruiser's Bill!

1044
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:36,612
We did it! Bill passing!

1045
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:39,197
Bruiser's Bill!

1046
00:52:39,268 --> 00:52:41,213
Important legislation
for our time.

1047
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:53,731
Bruiser, good work, little guy.

1048
00:52:58,793 --> 00:53:00,451
I would like
to conclude this hearing...

1049
00:53:00,521 --> 00:53:02,277
by thanking you all
for your testimony--

1050
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,654
Mr. Chairman, sir...

1051
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,832
The chair recognizes...

1052
00:53:04,904 --> 00:53:06,465
the gentlewoman
from Massachusetts.

1053
00:53:06,537 --> 00:53:08,710
Mr. Chairman,
committee members...

1054
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:12,163
I would like to thank you for
your consideration of this bill.

1055
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:14,921
However,
after further reflection...

1056
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:17,989
on the budgetary realities
of this fiscal year...

1057
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:21,377
I feel I must withdraw
my support for Bruiser's Bill.

1058
00:53:21,452 --> 00:53:24,006
- What?
- I concur!

1059
00:53:35,823 --> 00:53:37,711
Everybody, calm down.

1060
00:53:46,611 --> 00:53:48,368
I'm sorry, Bruiser.

1061
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:52,303
I'm sorry, too, Elle.

1062
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:54,543
I know you think
I've let you down.

1063
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:56,979
Believe me, I thought
about your reaction...

1064
00:53:57,044 --> 00:53:58,987
maybe more than I should have.

1065
00:54:00,694 --> 00:54:03,279
You were outmaneuvered...

1066
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:05,139
by Grace.

1067
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:06,899
Grace?

1068
00:54:06,968 --> 00:54:09,302
For the last two sessions
she's been pushing...

1069
00:54:09,367 --> 00:54:11,407
this homeowners incentives bill.

1070
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,521
This morning she struck a deal.

1071
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:17,302
I withdraw my support
for Bruiser's Bill.

1072
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:20,849
Homeowners incentives
comes to a vote.

1073
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:22,832
That was the price
and I paid it.

1074
00:54:22,905 --> 00:54:26,835
That's all just deals
and trades and secrets.

1075
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,298
That's not what people want.

1076
00:54:41,342 --> 00:54:44,888
Elle... I'm sorry.

1077
00:54:53,313 --> 00:54:55,169
Government of the people...

1078
00:54:55,234 --> 00:54:58,462
by the people, for the people.

1079
00:55:22,437 --> 00:55:25,188
So what's your story?

1080
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,645
Were you even honest?

1081
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:30,856
I guess you were.

1082
00:55:34,345 --> 00:55:35,522
If you didn't play games...

1083
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:38,758
then you were probably
the only one.

1084
00:55:41,323 --> 00:55:43,942
I just don't know how
you did it.

1085
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:46,248
I don't even mean
wearing that silly hat...

1086
00:55:46,315 --> 00:55:48,171
because that was really brave.

1087
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:50,276
But...

1088
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:53,163
Just trusting your country.

1089
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:55,685
Trusting this system...

1090
00:55:58,736 --> 00:56:00,907
Trusting yourself.

1091
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:03,048
I did.

1092
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:20,299
Go on.
It's full of warm fuzzies.

1093
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,054
With extra fuzz.

1094
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:37,838
"Elle Woods has amazing
lateral delts."

1095
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:40,692
That was my target
muscle group of the month.

1096
00:56:40,758 --> 00:56:43,509
Snaps for Elle's lateral delts.

1097
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:00,855
"Elle Woods inspires us."

1098
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:04,729
We even put little hearts
over the "Is".

1099
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:07,665
- I see that.
- It was my idea.

1100
00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:09,781
Thank you, Timothy.

1101
00:57:09,852 --> 00:57:12,220
Thank you, everybody.
This is really nice.

1102
00:57:12,285 --> 00:57:15,800
But I just don't think
I'm cut out for this.

1103
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:16,950
Elle, we have a plan.

1104
00:57:17,022 --> 00:57:19,544
Two words for you--
Discharge petition.

1105
00:57:19,617 --> 00:57:21,341
With a couple hundred
signatures...

1106
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:23,262
we can spring Bruiser's Bill
from committee...

1107
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:25,467
straight to the House floor
for a vote.

1108
00:57:25,537 --> 00:57:28,766
I don't know.
That sounds really complicated.

1109
00:57:28,832 --> 00:57:30,207
You've come
farther than any of us...

1110
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:32,315
while maintaining
your bounce and sparkle.

1111
00:57:32,387 --> 00:57:33,980
We never sparkle.

1112
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:37,020
None of us thought one person
could make a difference...

1113
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:39,163
until you came along.

1114
00:57:40,515 --> 00:57:44,062
If I remember correctly,
isn't that 218 signatures?

1115
00:57:44,133 --> 00:57:46,435
It's not that hard.

1116
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,869
Yeah.

1117
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:51,231
Yeah.

1118
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,464
I guess I know women
with more shoes than that.

1119
00:57:54,535 --> 00:57:57,600
Wait, that's me.

1120
00:57:57,671 --> 00:57:59,492
Elle...

1121
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:02,112
it's time to finish
what you started.

1122
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:07,526
OK, people,
a lot on the agenda today.

1123
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:10,409
Reenie, I'm still waiting on
those one-minute floor speeches.

1124
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:14,304
Timothy, I need recon on that
campaign finance reform hearing.

1125
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,965
Grace, status meeting
in my office right away.

1126
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:23,618
I said now.

1127
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:28,582
Where's my staff?

1128
00:58:28,654 --> 00:58:31,654
They quit, without notice.

1129
00:58:31,726 --> 00:58:33,702
Why?

1130
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,934
Marks and Hauser
just filed a petition...

1131
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:39,342
to discharge Bruiser's Bill.

1132
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:41,582
I'm pretty sure
that's where your staff is...

1133
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,235
led by their commander
Sorority Sue.

1134
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:52,499
Petition to discharge HR 2652,
aka Bruiser's Bill...

1135
00:58:52,564 --> 00:58:54,451
carried with no objections.

1136
00:58:54,515 --> 00:58:58,314
The petition is filed
and available for signature.

1137
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:01,677
Actually, we are strictly...

1138
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:05,011
"bring your own"
on the discharge petition.

1139
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:15,055
But it's pink... and scented.

1140
00:59:15,128 --> 00:59:18,390
Gives it something extra,
don't you think?

1141
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:20,845
We've both signed it,
as you can see.

1142
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,213
I believe we're being dismissed.
Thank you.

1143
00:59:24,282 --> 00:59:26,387
There will be others
to come and sign.

1144
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:28,466
- Don't you like pink?
- Come on!

1145
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,693
Up on your feet, people.

1146
00:59:45,757 --> 00:59:48,408
Discharge petition time.

1147
00:59:48,477 --> 00:59:49,820
Upsy-daisy.

1148
00:59:52,158 --> 00:59:54,811
We have our work
cut out for us. Let's go.

1149
00:59:57,121 --> 01:00:00,416
OK, we have two signatures.
216 to go.

1150
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:01,912
I'll break up the country
into color codes.

1151
01:00:01,986 --> 01:00:03,842
Timothy, you're teal.

1152
01:00:03,907 --> 01:00:06,012
Reena, you're magenta.

1153
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,254
And Elle is marigold.

1154
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:09,753
And I've got
the Wellington covered.

1155
01:00:09,828 --> 01:00:11,552
37 signatures in residence.

1156
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,204
Sid Post, 37.

1157
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:17,146
Congress adjourns in 3 weeks.
We can't do this alone.

1158
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,075
That's why I'm calling in
reinforcements.

1159
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,351
I hope we're talking...

1160
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:22,658
the brightest political
minds in the country.

1161
01:00:24,965 --> 01:00:26,592
We're here!

1162
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:33,472
Oh, my God!

1163
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,087
Oh, gosh, we can't wait
to see the Mall.

1164
01:00:38,154 --> 01:00:39,616
And the Statue of Liberty.

1165
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,992
Everybody, these are
my Delta Nu sisters.

1166
01:00:42,058 --> 01:00:43,584
This is Margot and Serena.

1167
01:00:43,657 --> 01:00:47,073
Josh made the cruise boat
pull over in Puerto Vallarta.

1168
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:48,423
I left L.A.
Right after landing...

1169
01:00:48,491 --> 01:00:51,012
a lateral split in
the third quarter dance break.

1170
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,702
It was awesome.
I went "Yah!" and "Haah!"

1171
01:00:53,772 --> 01:00:56,163
- That's so great.
- Yeah, thanks.

1172
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:58,658
So, is it time?

1173
01:00:58,733 --> 01:01:00,838
Oh, no, it's not time yet.

1174
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:07,721
Hello? You're here?

1175
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,662
We'll meet you in the lobby.
Let's go.

1176
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,912
Everybody, this is
the final member of our team...

1177
01:01:15,985 --> 01:01:17,065
Paulette Parcelle.

1178
01:01:17,137 --> 01:01:19,986
Who's ready to discharge?

1179
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:24,523
And proposition a bill
and... whatever.

1180
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:26,635
Let's hit the Hill.

1181
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:30,249
If I could have
a moment of your time--

1182
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:33,107
You could consider something--

1183
01:01:33,173 --> 01:01:35,856
Quadrant 4, corridor 6,
have lost one.

1184
01:01:37,685 --> 01:01:40,555
Sorry. How are you?

1185
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:41,808
If I could have a minute
of your time?

1186
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:43,733
Reena, how are you?

1187
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,227
Has anybody told you
about Bruiser's Bill?

1188
01:01:45,303 --> 01:01:46,897
Is it trivial,
Congressman Hannenfeld?

1189
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:48,879
Animals don't have
the same reactions...

1190
01:01:48,953 --> 01:01:50,032
to drugs that humans do.

1191
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:51,185
It's like the time...

1192
01:01:51,257 --> 01:01:52,719
my trainer's sister's
cousin's girlfriend...

1193
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,255
gave her overweight Yorkie
some phen-fen...

1194
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,857
because she was
a little bit fat...

1195
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,272
and it gained three pounds.

1196
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,673
Desired result?
I don't think so.

1197
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:01,777
You know?

1198
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:05,972
Oh, my dear, gifted woman...

1199
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:07,253
you tell that Bruiser Woods...

1200
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,877
he can count on
the Sunshine State.

1201
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:12,021
Thank you, Ohio.

1202
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:23,514
Thank you, Atlanta!

1203
01:02:23,584 --> 01:02:25,308
Who's next?

1204
01:02:25,377 --> 01:02:26,807
You're next!

1205
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,583
We're gonna do it.

1206
01:02:37,538 --> 01:02:38,945
Serena...

1207
01:02:39,011 --> 01:02:42,143
why do they keep
sending us to Room 216?

1208
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:45,059
"Intern Orientation."

1209
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:48,444
Margot, you're a genius.

1210
01:02:48,517 --> 01:02:49,923
If this doesn't get
more signatures...

1211
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:51,102
I don't know what will.

1212
01:02:53,446 --> 01:02:56,227
Intern class of 2003 on deck!

1213
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:04,357
Remember, flexibility counts.

1214
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:10,338
Ready? OK!

1215
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:13,472
Dogs of the world unite!

1216
01:03:38,352 --> 01:03:39,945
2... 4... 6... 8!

1217
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,221
Sign the petition, win a date!

1218
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:45,071
Go Bruiser's Bill, go!

1219
01:03:47,571 --> 01:03:49,030
Well, I'm signing.

1220
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,736
Yes, Bob,
I know what you're reading.

1221
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:56,494
Are you kidding?

1222
01:03:56,562 --> 01:03:59,411
Your support has been
invaluable to me.

1223
01:03:59,476 --> 01:04:02,095
If it weren't for you,
I'd be painting my own posters.

1224
01:04:02,164 --> 01:04:05,295
I don't care
if she has two weeks left.

1225
01:04:05,364 --> 01:04:06,990
She could have two years left.

1226
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:08,555
She won't pull this off.

1227
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:13,847
I will not be outmaneuvered
by this silly little blonde.

1228
01:04:15,544 --> 01:04:17,965
Don't worry, Bob.
I'll get her...

1229
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:20,144
and her little dog, too.

1230
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:23,283
Even with
the entire Wellington...

1231
01:04:23,353 --> 01:04:25,873
and 68 life-changing haircuts
under Paulette's belt...

1232
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,025
we're still not even close.

1233
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,756
We got a problem here.

1234
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:31,860
The bad news is...

1235
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,818
Reena.

1236
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:46,390
Wow. You look amazing.

1237
01:04:46,461 --> 01:04:49,277
It's just layers
and highlights...

1238
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:50,836
and a cellulose
finishing rinse.

1239
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,700
I did it.

1240
01:04:52,766 --> 01:04:54,709
Cool.

1241
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,375
What is the bad news?

1242
01:04:56,446 --> 01:04:59,296
We lost Hannenfeld.
We were planning on him...

1243
01:04:59,361 --> 01:05:01,664
to bring Felsen, Parks,
and Janowitz on board.

1244
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,737
What are you talking about?
I talked to Hannenfeld myself.

1245
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,177
I confirmed with his aide
this morning over breakfast.

1246
01:05:06,242 --> 01:05:09,242
I don't know. Somebody must've
got to him at lunch.

1247
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:11,617
It's Grace.

1248
01:05:11,683 --> 01:05:14,170
- Please make sure.
- I will. Two weeks?

1249
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:15,934
I'm looking for Grace Rossiter.

1250
01:05:16,003 --> 01:05:18,655
I just want to know
if she's coming back soon.

1251
01:05:18,724 --> 01:05:20,763
Elle. Hi.

1252
01:05:20,836 --> 01:05:22,014
Oh, hi.

1253
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,157
I was going to call you.

1254
01:05:24,229 --> 01:05:26,816
I was looking for Grace.

1255
01:05:26,886 --> 01:05:28,414
The discharge petition.

1256
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:30,145
We lost Hannenfeld...

1257
01:05:30,215 --> 01:05:32,157
and I was wondering
if Grace knew anything about it.

1258
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:34,272
None of that
is important anymore.

1259
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:36,645
Could I speak with you
for a moment?

1260
01:05:36,712 --> 01:05:38,469
Sure.

1261
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:47,654
You did it, Elle. You won.

1262
01:05:47,722 --> 01:05:50,407
You can collect Bruiser's mom
anytime you like.

1263
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:51,783
What?

1264
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,535
If you promise not to be
disappointed in me again...

1265
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:57,833
I'll tell you.
I pulled a few strings.

1266
01:05:57,899 --> 01:06:02,157
C'est Magnifique is releasing
all of their test animals.

1267
01:06:02,222 --> 01:06:03,651
All of them?

1268
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,450
All of them.
And what's more...

1269
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:06,796
they have been so impressed...

1270
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:09,066
with how you've handled
yourself down here...

1271
01:06:09,134 --> 01:06:12,911
they want you on board as
head of their legal department.

1272
01:06:12,976 --> 01:06:14,350
It's a very generous offer.

1273
01:06:14,415 --> 01:06:16,587
I don't know.

1274
01:06:16,656 --> 01:06:18,063
You did it.

1275
01:06:18,129 --> 01:06:20,585
You did what
you came here to do.

1276
01:06:20,658 --> 01:06:23,408
Yeah, but what about
the discharge petition?

1277
01:06:23,474 --> 01:06:25,481
This isn't
about just one animal...

1278
01:06:25,554 --> 01:06:26,634
it's all of the animals.

1279
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:29,260
I agree, but you've got
a great team in place.

1280
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:30,793
They can carry on without you.

1281
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:33,421
C'est Magnifique wants you
up there by Monday.

1282
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:36,623
You can go home.

1283
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:39,182
Congratulations, Elle.

1284
01:06:39,254 --> 01:06:41,326
Wow. Thank you.
Thanks for doing that.

1285
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:43,187
Well, sure.

1286
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:49,430
We have to stick together,
us Washington blondes.

1287
01:06:49,496 --> 01:06:52,146
Do you know who
Representative Hannenfeld...

1288
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:54,737
had lunch with today
in the members dining room?

1289
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,840
I skipped lunch today.
Had a facial.

1290
01:06:58,906 --> 01:07:01,274
OK. Thanks.

1291
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:03,313
I'll call you about that.

1292
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,815
Yeah.

1293
01:07:15,486 --> 01:07:18,039
Emmett, I know you're probably
in Case Law class right now...

1294
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,020
but call me back
when you get this.

1295
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:22,332
I think I'm coming home.

1296
01:07:22,399 --> 01:07:24,186
But it's a good thing.

1297
01:07:24,255 --> 01:07:27,290
Maybe. Call me back.

1298
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:40,896
Will you leave us alone now?

1299
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:42,489
Excuse me?

1300
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:44,472
I know you've been
working against us...

1301
01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:45,757
and I know
somehow it's personal.

1302
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:48,163
- You don't like me.
- Clearly.

1303
01:07:48,228 --> 01:07:51,710
If I leave Washington,
will you call off the fight...

1304
01:07:51,782 --> 01:07:53,190
and let Bruiser's Bill
have a fair shot?

1305
01:07:53,255 --> 01:07:56,568
Your bill is trivial to me.
I have my own agenda.

1306
01:07:56,644 --> 01:07:59,909
Like the homeowners bill you
pushed through at our expense?

1307
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,535
That's all I'm asking, Grace--

1308
01:08:01,606 --> 01:08:04,324
Homeowners incentives?
I wouldn't touch that bill.

1309
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:06,725
It's a tax break
for the wealthy.

1310
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:11,868
Haven't you been pushing it
for the last two sessions?

1311
01:08:11,944 --> 01:08:14,694
Victoria has a live interview
with Connie Chung in an hour.

1312
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,933
I don't have time for this.

1313
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:19,337
That's the interview
she's preparing for?

1314
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:21,771
She's in makeup right now.

1315
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:23,722
She's in makeup?

1316
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,705
Mike test, 1-2-3.

1317
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,144
Is Miss Chung available?

1318
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:28,706
I'd like to go over
some ground rules

1319
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,597
before we go on live,
for goodness sakes.

1320
01:08:31,662 --> 01:08:33,931
Yes, OK. Thanks.

1321
01:08:35,822 --> 01:08:37,546
Doesn't she have
a beautiful complexion?

1322
01:08:37,615 --> 01:08:40,366
She's like a PSA for SPF.

1323
01:08:40,432 --> 01:08:42,734
Thank you, Elle.
I thought you were gone.

1324
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,586
Home? No, no, no.
I'm not ready yet--

1325
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:46,063
Epidermally speaking,
that is.

1326
01:08:46,127 --> 01:08:48,104
I'm actually feeling
a little bit muddy.

1327
01:08:48,177 --> 01:08:49,770
I need a light exfoliation...

1328
01:08:49,841 --> 01:08:51,051
followed by
super rich hydration...

1329
01:08:51,121 --> 01:08:53,872
and I thought, Victoria will
have a good recommendation.

1330
01:08:53,938 --> 01:08:56,043
Sweetie, this really
isn't the best time.

1331
01:08:56,114 --> 01:08:57,456
I know you're very busy...

1332
01:08:57,522 --> 01:08:59,377
so I already called
your facialist.

1333
01:08:59,442 --> 01:09:02,257
The thing is she said
you didn't come in today.

1334
01:09:02,322 --> 01:09:05,009
Oh, no, no.
I went someplace else.

1335
01:09:05,077 --> 01:09:06,507
Someplace new. Is that all?

1336
01:09:06,582 --> 01:09:07,661
No, that's not all.

1337
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:10,255
Every woman knows
that a good facial...

1338
01:09:10,327 --> 01:09:12,562
can be a painful experience
if done properly...

1339
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,925
resulting in red blotchy areas
all over your skin...

1340
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:18,576
swelling, tenderness
in your T-zone area.

1341
01:09:18,646 --> 01:09:21,265
Even more so if your facialist
is Eastern European...

1342
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:22,797
as so many of the best are.

1343
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:24,912
Payback for the fall
of Communism, I like to say.

1344
01:09:24,985 --> 01:09:27,373
What on earth
are you talking about?

1345
01:09:27,448 --> 01:09:28,910
Isn't it
the first rule of facials...

1346
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:30,676
that there's a 24-hour window
between a facial...

1347
01:09:30,746 --> 01:09:33,495
and any major occasion
such as a date or a dance...

1348
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:36,312
or maybe an interview
with Mrs. Maury Povich?

1349
01:09:36,378 --> 01:09:38,201
I don't think that's a rule...

1350
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:40,472
the most well-groomed woman
in Washington would forget.

1351
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,777
This is ridiculous.
Could we clear this room?

1352
01:09:42,844 --> 01:09:44,186
You lied to me
about your lunch hour.

1353
01:09:44,252 --> 01:09:47,123
Why? Because you were having
lunch with Hannenfeld?

1354
01:09:47,197 --> 01:09:50,263
You've been lobbying
against us all this time.

1355
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:55,386
For God's sakes, enough.
Thank you. Out, out, out.

1356
01:09:55,455 --> 01:09:58,205
Thank you.
I'll be with you in a moment.

1357
01:10:01,152 --> 01:10:05,374
Yes. I lied to you.
I killed Bruiser's Bill.

1358
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:06,585
But you're an animal lover.

1359
01:10:06,656 --> 01:10:08,381
What about Dolly Madison,
your beagle?

1360
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,425
Not mine. I borrowed it.

1361
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:13,216
And it reeked.
Looked good on the sofa.

1362
01:10:13,283 --> 01:10:16,097
We've been through
all of this before.

1363
01:10:16,162 --> 01:10:18,553
I traded your bill
for the homeowners bill...

1364
01:10:18,628 --> 01:10:20,189
that Grace had committed me to.

1365
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:22,846
That's a lie.
Grace never wanted that.

1366
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:26,081
You blocked this bill
and I want to know why.

1367
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:27,579
- Why?
- Yes, why?

1368
01:10:27,655 --> 01:10:30,786
Why does anything happen
in Washington? Survival.

1369
01:10:30,854 --> 01:10:33,789
You have no idea what it takes
to get here and stay here.

1370
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:35,326
The money it takes.

1371
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,748
It just so happens that
my chief financial contributor

1372
01:10:38,824 --> 01:10:42,053
purchased half share
in a major cosmetics company...

1373
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:45,633
and they want to continue
testing on animals...

1374
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,198
so much so
that they're willing...

1375
01:10:47,272 --> 01:10:49,346
to bankroll my opponent
in next year's elections...

1376
01:10:49,418 --> 01:10:52,549
if I did not kill your bill.

1377
01:10:52,618 --> 01:10:54,561
I trusted you.

1378
01:10:54,635 --> 01:10:56,676
I looked up to you.

1379
01:10:56,748 --> 01:11:00,808
I can't do anyone any good
if I'm no longer here.

1380
01:11:00,877 --> 01:11:03,017
But you're not doing
anybody any good.

1381
01:11:03,086 --> 01:11:06,948
Nobody in your district,
not even yourself.

1382
01:11:07,023 --> 01:11:10,437
And I'm sorry,
but I can't let that happen.

1383
01:11:14,254 --> 01:11:16,589
You can't prove
why I changed my vote...

1384
01:11:16,655 --> 01:11:17,900
or how I blocked your bill.

1385
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:19,976
It's your word against mine...

1386
01:11:20,048 --> 01:11:22,439
and I've spent 20 years
building up my credibility...

1387
01:11:22,513 --> 01:11:24,237
in this town and back home.

1388
01:11:24,306 --> 01:11:26,094
I'm not going to the press.

1389
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,977
I don't believe in blackmail.

1390
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:31,017
But I do believe
in the people...

1391
01:11:31,089 --> 01:11:33,361
and I'm going to take
Bruiser's Bill to them.

1392
01:11:33,428 --> 01:11:35,598
The people believe
what we tell them to believe.

1393
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,043
It'll never work, Elle.

1394
01:11:37,108 --> 01:11:39,760
You can't get
the people to care.

1395
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,690
Watch me.

1396
01:12:02,201 --> 01:12:04,372
Ladies...

1397
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,870
it's time.

1398
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:09,492
You mean...

1399
01:12:09,563 --> 01:12:11,058
Are you sure?

1400
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:14,710
As sure as I am that nobody
looks good in paisley.

1401
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,984
Are you with me?

1402
01:12:17,052 --> 01:12:20,729
I think so. Serena?

1403
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:26,552
Yeah. Yes.
We're with you, Elle.

1404
01:12:27,616 --> 01:12:28,991
Go for it.

1405
01:12:43,043 --> 01:12:44,451
Oh, my God!

1406
01:12:49,507 --> 01:12:51,809
Delta Nu president,
Chapter 2-6...

1407
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:55,937
I.D. Number 097435.
Third from the top.

1408
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:58,656
6234978,
fifth from the top...

1409
01:12:58,725 --> 01:13:01,214
calling to activate
phone tree number 255.

1410
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:03,674
Call to activate
phone tree 255!

1411
01:13:03,749 --> 01:13:05,124
This is not a fire drill.

1412
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:07,524
I repeat, this is not a drill!

1413
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:14,370
Sisters mobilized.
E.T.A. 0800 hours.

1414
01:13:20,137 --> 01:13:21,895
- Hi, Heather, it's Buffy.
- Hi, Kiki, it's Tiffani.

1415
01:13:21,962 --> 01:13:23,937
- Hi, Amber, it's Becky.
- Hi, Audrey, it's Melanie.

1416
01:13:24,011 --> 01:13:25,799
- Hi, Jos, it's Breena.
- Hi, Courtney, it's Veronica.

1417
01:13:25,867 --> 01:13:27,624
- Hi, Christy, it's Nat.
- Hi, Binky, it's Nicki.

1418
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:30,507
- Hi, Jill, it's Jojo.
- Hi, Allison, it's Cookie.

1419
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,882
You will never believe
what happened.

1420
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,161
Elle just called
and she needs our help...

1421
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:34,950
Suzy, we're taking it
to Defcon One.

1422
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:36,133
There's a crisis right now.

1423
01:13:36,205 --> 01:13:37,831
Where the president is.
Exactly.

1424
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:40,005
There's an emergency
in Washington.

1425
01:13:40,077 --> 01:13:41,866
Road trip?

1426
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,623
OK, see you in Washington.

1427
01:14:20,341 --> 01:14:23,375
Save Bruiser's mom!

1428
01:14:23,446 --> 01:14:25,006
Save Bruiser's mom!

1429
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:26,573
Help me out, tell a friend.

1430
01:14:26,646 --> 01:14:29,996
Save Bruiser's mom!

1431
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:31,414
I like your necklace.

1432
01:14:45,499 --> 01:14:48,567
Gay Dogs of America
support Bruiser's Bill!

1433
01:14:48,637 --> 01:14:50,011
We're gonna tee it
around 12:00--

1434
01:14:50,077 --> 01:14:52,182
Miss, save me a good one.

1435
01:14:52,253 --> 01:14:54,359
Full-color big picture
of Bruiser.

1436
01:14:54,429 --> 01:14:56,819
Emmett!
What are you doing here?

1437
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,717
Wedding research.

1438
01:14:58,783 --> 01:14:59,960
What?

1439
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,610
Elle, your work is here now
and it's important.

1440
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,655
So I'm bringing
the wedding to you.

1441
01:15:05,728 --> 01:15:08,576
First step,
get groom to Washington.

1442
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:11,547
But what about Fenway Park?

1443
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,129
Look, I don't care
where I marry you...

1444
01:15:15,202 --> 01:15:16,860
just as long as I do.

1445
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:20,314
I do. I do. Feels good.

1446
01:15:21,348 --> 01:15:23,071
So what's Step Two?

1447
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:30,465
That's Step Two.

1448
01:15:30,533 --> 01:15:33,882
Save Bruiser's mom!

1449
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:37,603
Save Bruiser's mom!

1450
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:41,184
Save Bruiser's mom!

1451
01:15:41,254 --> 01:15:43,393
Save Bruiser's mom!

1452
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:04,709
Colorado. Photo ops after.

1453
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:06,920
Grace, are you all right?

1454
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:10,819
Save Bruiser's mom!

1455
01:16:10,893 --> 01:16:14,473
Save Bruiser's mom!

1456
01:16:14,542 --> 01:16:16,647
Save Bruiser's mom!

1457
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:37,865
Rutherford. Check.

1458
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:39,368
Porter. Check.

1459
01:16:39,443 --> 01:16:41,004
Hutchins. Check.

1460
01:16:42,835 --> 01:16:44,747
Uh-oh. That's it.

1461
01:16:44,821 --> 01:16:46,731
It's not enough.

1462
01:16:46,806 --> 01:16:47,917
Tomorrow's a wash.

1463
01:16:47,989 --> 01:16:49,516
It's National Education Day.

1464
01:16:51,094 --> 01:16:53,461
Got a meeting of both Houses,
ceremonial speeches--

1465
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:56,145
there's no time for politicking.

1466
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:58,255
Sorry, Elle, we tried.

1467
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:00,216
We have to keep trying.

1468
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,459
Hello?

1469
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,311
You want those
last fifteen signatures?

1470
01:17:04,377 --> 01:17:05,489
Grace?

1471
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:07,450
It'll take
something extraordinary.

1472
01:17:07,514 --> 01:17:08,942
You'll have to pull something...

1473
01:17:09,018 --> 01:17:11,123
no regular citizen
would ever dream of.

1474
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,876
Fine, but how am I
going to do that?

1475
01:17:13,945 --> 01:17:15,539
You're going to address
the entire Congress...

1476
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:17,401
and I know just the person
to make it happen.

1477
01:17:17,468 --> 01:17:20,087
Who? Is that even possible?

1478
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:23,933
Look, Elle,
you may be above blackmail...

1479
01:17:23,998 --> 01:17:25,403
but I'm not.

1480
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,064
Grace, why are you helping me?

1481
01:17:35,136 --> 01:17:38,005
Because once upon a time
I loved politics...

1482
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,968
and I want to do some good.

1483
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:43,449
What has that got to do with me?

1484
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:46,718
Look, those silly girls
that I told you about...

1485
01:17:46,785 --> 01:17:49,154
with the blisters on their feet?

1486
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:52,537
I was one of them.

1487
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:57,182
We have celebrated today
elementary education...

1488
01:17:57,252 --> 01:18:00,448
secondary
and higher education...

1489
01:18:00,516 --> 01:18:04,544
and now...

1490
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,556
Don't even think about it.

1491
01:18:06,632 --> 01:18:10,755
And now...

1492
01:18:10,823 --> 01:18:14,173
This is
a little unconventional.

1493
01:18:14,248 --> 01:18:16,550
With the Speaker's...

1494
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:19,879
and the president
of the Senate's permission...

1495
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:23,461
please indulge me
as I share the floor...

1496
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:25,505
with my constituent...

1497
01:18:25,578 --> 01:18:27,301
who in the spirit
of education...

1498
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:31,331
would like to educate us all
on a vital issue...

1499
01:18:31,402 --> 01:18:33,192
facing us today.

1500
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,456
Ladies and gentlemen
of both Houses...

1501
01:18:36,524 --> 01:18:41,032
I give you Ms. Elle Woods.

1502
01:19:13,269 --> 01:19:15,090
It's all yours.

1503
01:19:19,349 --> 01:19:21,237
Thank you, Congresswoman.

1504
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:25,107
Hello, everyone,
my name is Elle Woods...

1505
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:27,860
and I'm here
to speak to you today...

1506
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:31,473
about a piece of legislation
called Bruiser's Bill.

1507
01:19:41,562 --> 01:19:44,019
But you know...

1508
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:47,190
today is supposed to be
about education.

1509
01:19:47,259 --> 01:19:51,514
So instead, I want to tell you
about the education...

1510
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,620
you all have given me
over the past three months.

1511
01:19:53,693 --> 01:19:55,514
What about Bruiser's Bill?
We still need 15 signatures.

1512
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,759
She's blowing it.

1513
01:19:56,829 --> 01:19:59,699
I came to Washington
to help my dog Bruiser...

1514
01:19:59,774 --> 01:20:01,149
and somewhere
along the way...

1515
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:04,957
I learned
a really unexpected lesson.

1516
01:20:06,207 --> 01:20:09,339
I know what you're thinking--
Who is this girl?

1517
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:12,540
And what could this simple,
small-town girl from Bel Air...

1518
01:20:12,609 --> 01:20:15,609
have to say to all of us?
I'll tell you.

1519
01:20:15,681 --> 01:20:19,772
It's about something
that's bigger than me...

1520
01:20:19,841 --> 01:20:22,810
or any single act
of legislation.

1521
01:20:22,882 --> 01:20:25,817
This is about a matter
that should be at...

1522
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:29,438
the highest importance
to every American--

1523
01:20:30,531 --> 01:20:32,834
My hair.

1524
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:36,612
There's this salon
in Beverly Hills.

1525
01:20:36,677 --> 01:20:40,322
It's really fancy and beautiful.

1526
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:42,246
It's impossible
to get an appointment.

1527
01:20:42,311 --> 01:20:44,548
Unless you're Julia Roberts
or from "Friends"...

1528
01:20:44,615 --> 01:20:46,208
you can just forget it.

1529
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:49,924
But one day, they called me.
They had an opening.

1530
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:52,164
So I was going to finally
get the chance...

1531
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:54,273
to sit in one of
those sacred beauty chairs.

1532
01:20:54,345 --> 01:20:56,255
I was so excited.

1533
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:59,330
Then the colorist...

1534
01:20:59,402 --> 01:21:02,566
gave me Brassy Brigitte
instead of Harlow Honey.

1535
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:06,597
The shampoo girl washed my hair
with spiral perm solution...

1536
01:21:06,668 --> 01:21:09,537
instead of color-intensive
moisturizing shampoo.

1537
01:21:09,612 --> 01:21:12,679
Finally, the stylist...

1538
01:21:12,749 --> 01:21:16,774
gave me a bob... with bangs.

1539
01:21:17,774 --> 01:21:21,156
Suffice to say,
it was just wrong.

1540
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:25,640
All wrong. For me, you know?

1541
01:21:25,712 --> 01:21:27,021
First I was angry.

1542
01:21:27,088 --> 01:21:30,406
And then I realized my anger
was completely misdirected.

1543
01:21:30,482 --> 01:21:32,455
This wasn't the salon's fault.

1544
01:21:32,528 --> 01:21:35,115
I had sat there and
witnessed this injustice...

1545
01:21:35,186 --> 01:21:36,811
and had let it happen.

1546
01:21:36,881 --> 01:21:41,455
I didn't get involved
in the process.

1547
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:45,101
I forgot to use my voice.

1548
01:21:45,171 --> 01:21:49,100
I forgot to believe in myself.

1549
01:21:49,172 --> 01:21:51,344
But now I know better.

1550
01:21:51,413 --> 01:21:57,231
I know that one honest voice
can be louder than a crowd.

1551
01:21:57,303 --> 01:22:01,941
I know that
if we lose our voice...

1552
01:22:02,008 --> 01:22:05,586
or if we let those
who speak on our behalf...

1553
01:22:05,656 --> 01:22:08,177
compromise our voice...

1554
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:12,245
then, this country...

1555
01:22:12,315 --> 01:22:14,965
this country is in
for a really bad haircut.

1556
01:22:19,419 --> 01:22:21,655
So speak up, America.

1557
01:22:21,723 --> 01:22:23,218
Speak up!

1558
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:26,554
Speak up for the home
of the brave.

1559
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:30,102
Speak up for the land
of the free gift with purchase.

1560
01:22:30,174 --> 01:22:34,549
Speak up, America. Speak up!

1561
01:22:37,278 --> 01:22:39,134
And remember...

1562
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,207
you are beautiful.

1563
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:46,488
Thank you.

1564
01:22:59,747 --> 01:23:01,308
Thank you.

1565
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,834
Everyone, it's time I spoke up.

1566
01:23:03,907 --> 01:23:06,111
I think Timothy's smoking!

1567
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:13,308
I'm married.

1568
01:23:15,143 --> 01:23:16,389
Thank you.

1569
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:08,780
You didn't! Thank you!

1570
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,279
Thank you!

1571
01:24:13,203 --> 01:24:14,283
Thank you.

1572
01:24:14,355 --> 01:24:17,455
What is this? Oh, my God!

1573
01:24:18,677 --> 01:24:20,203
That's so perfect!

1574
01:24:45,177 --> 01:24:47,894
This week,
Congresswoman Libby Hauser...

1575
01:24:47,962 --> 01:24:50,231
finished decorating
her house...

1576
01:24:50,298 --> 01:24:52,154
sent her son off to college...

1577
01:24:52,219 --> 01:24:54,194
