1
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:09,511
Axxon N., the longest running radio play in history

2
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:14,100
tonight, continuing in the Baltic region.

3
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:18,146
A gray winter day in an old hotel.

4
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,573
The stairway is dark

5
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:38,585
I don't recognize this hallway.
Where are we?

6
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:41,839
At our room now

7
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:45,259
I don't have the key

8
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:48,013
No, you gave it to me. I have it

9
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,935
What's wrong with me?

10
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:09,495
This is the room? I don't recognize it

11
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,916
- Take off your clothes.
- Sure.

12
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,130
You know what whores do?

13
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:22,050
Yes

14
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,428
They fuck

15
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:34,356
- Do you want to fuck me?
- Take off your clothes

16
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:38,527
I'll tell you what I want

17
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,654
Fine

18
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,046
I'm afraid

19
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,302
I'm afraid

20
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:49,630
I am going to find out one day.

21
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,471
When will you tell him?

22
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:04,855
Who could have known?

23
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:12,573
What time is it

24
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:30,592
I have a secret.

25
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:42,147
There have been no calls today.

26
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,211
I hear someone.

27
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:16,184
I do not think it will be much longer now.

28
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:41,946
You are looking for something?

29
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:44,199
Yes

30
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:46,992
- Are you looking to go in?
- Yes

31
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,956
An opening?

32
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:55,586
- Look for an opening. Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand

33
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:59,423
- Do you understand I look for an opening?
- Yes. I understand completely.

34
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:03,094
Good. Good that you understand.

35
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,062
That's good!

36
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,605
You understand!

37
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,391
May I help you?

38
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,886
I am a new neighbor.

39
00:09:57,011 --> 00:10:00,641
I live just down the street.

40
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,644
Ma'm?

41
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,985
Hello!

42
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,325
I don't mean to intrude

43
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:19,452
I am your new neighbor.

44
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:26,086
I hope that it is not being incovenient for you?

45
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,297
No, no.

46
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:31,091
Please, sit down.

47
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:38,183
Such a lovely home!

48
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,685
Thank you.

49
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,562
We enjoy it very much

50
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:44,063
Please

51
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,739
Uh, would you like uh, coffee?

52
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:55,409
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

53
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:56,953
And for you, ma'm?

54
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,123
the same, Henry,
thank you.

55
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:09,300
I've, I've been going around
meeting new neighbors.

56
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,638
I think that it is important
know one's neighbors.

57
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,683
To say "hello" to them.

58
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:25,109
Yes, it's very rare these days
but that's very nice.

59
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:29,197
Which house are you living in?

60
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,460
Just down the way.

61
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:37,624
Tucked back in the
small woods.

62
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,503
The brick house.

63
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:45,549
I think I know the one.

64
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:51,097
It is difficult to see it from the road.

65
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,868
Thank you.

66
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,352
Milk and sugar?

67
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:43,321
OH, yes, very good.

68
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,407
Will that be all ma'm?

69
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,491
Yes. Yes, thank you.

70
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:51,872
I'll be just close by
if you need me.

71
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,625
Thank you, Henry.

72
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:05,012
So...

73
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,600
You have a new role
to play, I hear.

74
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:13,437
Up for a role

75
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:17,734
But, I'm afraid,
far from getting it.

76
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:21,821
No, no, I definitively heard
that you have it.

77
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,160
Oh?

78
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:28,579
It is an...

79
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,419
Is it an interesting role?

80
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,923
Oh yes, very

81
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:43,888
Is it about marriage?

82
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:50,020
Um... perhaps, in some ways...
but... um...

83
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:54,108
Your husband, he's involved?

84
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,236
No.

85
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:18,217
A little boy
went out to play.

86
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,699
When he opened his door...

87
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:24,642
...he saw...
the world.

88
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:29,063
As he passed through the doorway...

89
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:34,194
...he caused, a reflection.

90
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:37,907
Evil was born

91
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:45,330
Evil was born,
and followed the boy.

92
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:54,424
I'm sorry...
what is that?

93
00:14:57,302 --> 00:15:00,556
An old tale.

94
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:04,102
And a variation:

95
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:06,145
A little girl...

96
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:09,733
...went out to play.

97
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,531
...lost in the marketplace...

98
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:19,118
...as if half born.

99
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:30,171
Then, not through the marketplace,
you see that, don't you?

100
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:34,718
But through the alley
behind the marketplace.

101
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:40,267
This is the way
to the Palace.

102
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:48,526
But it isn't something you remember.

103
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:55,157
Forgetfulness, it happens to us all.

104
00:15:55,491 --> 00:16:00,831
And me?... why, I'm the worst one!

105
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:05,294
OH, where was I?

106
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:15,513
Yeah.. Is there is a murder
in your film?

107
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:24,064
Ah, no, it's not part of the story...

108
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,359
No!

109
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,571
I think you are wrong about that!

110
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,325
No.

111
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,328
Brutal fuckin' murder!

112
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,999
Ah... I don't like this kind of talk

113
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,754
The things you've been saying,
I think should go now.

114
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,174
Yes...

115
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:57,019
Me... I.. I can't seem to remember if it's
today, two days from now, or yesterday!

116
00:16:57,645 --> 00:17:02,942
I suppose that if it was 9:45...

117
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:06,488
I'd think it was after midnight!

118
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:13,369
For instance...

119
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,372
If today...

120
00:17:15,914 --> 00:17:18,548
...was tomorrow...

121
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:26,509
...you would'nt even remember
that you owed on an unpaid bill.

122
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,098
Actions...

123
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:34,935
...do have consequences.

124
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:41,443
And yet

125
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,654
...there is the magic.

126
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:50,076
If it was tomorrow...

127
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:57,085
...you would be sitting over there.

128
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:15,230
You see?

129
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,785
Excuse me, ma'm?

130
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:32,540
Excuse me, ma'm,
telephone.

131
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,836
It's for you.

132
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:39,925
It's your agent.

133
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,013
Greg!

134
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:50,353
Greg!

135
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,398
Oh my god! Oh my god!

136
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,414
My God

137
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:28,936
Nikki, it's we who are happy
and fortunate to have you on board

138
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:32,064
...on this film,
in this role.

139
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:36,111
I meant everything I said in
praising Devon.

140
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:40,283
And forgive me, I do love
making speeches.

141
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:42,702
I mean this too...

142
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:46,247
You have everything you need to soar
back to the top...

143
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,750
...and to stay perched there.

144
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:53,881
This film, you and Devon,
a great director.

145
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,844
Yes, do I hear?

146
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,139
The script is well, we're going to plunge into.

147
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:05,144
If all play our role,
do our best...

148
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:07,520
...if we work hard together

149
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,441
...well, this could be the one...

150
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,777
This is a starmaker, if ever I saw
one, you'll see

151
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:18,867
I think we have a chance
to pull it off...

152
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:21,161
what do you say?

153
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:24,332
Let's do it!

154
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:28,586
If you don't fuck it up Kingsley,
I'm sure we can!

155
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,966
I never felt better
in my life.

156
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:35,593
Champaign and caviar
is on its way.

157
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:43,811
Tonight, Nikki Grace
and Devon Berk.

158
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,856
Marsha, honey I know where you live,
do not pull my hair.

159
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,191
We're back in:

160
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:52,362
5,4,3,2,1.

161
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:56,408
Mamas, lock up you daughter's doors!

162
00:20:56,492 --> 00:21:02,748
Nikki, really, this news, this
shocking revelation by Devon...

163
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:06,628
...must send a shiver down your spine!

164
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,422
Are you going to be able to be true
to hubby with a wolf in the den?

165
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:12,885
do with a bad wolf round you

166
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:15,303
Now, Marilyn...

167
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:20,309
I'm sure we'll get on famously,
in a professional way

168
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:23,647
and that's how it will stay,
professional.

169
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:34,241
And, Devon, your naughty boy,
are you hiding a smile?

170
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:38,204
Is your devilish mind scheming?

171
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,670
If you're looking for shock value Marilyn,
I suggest that you look in the mirror.

172
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,301
What a bitting wit!

173
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,974
But I tell you this:
Marilyn Levins is going to be watching,

174
00:21:56,016 --> 00:22:00,353
and she will be reporting to you
everything she finds out!

175
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:07,821
There, and there, and there and beyond
around the world!

176
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:11,992
The Marilyn Levins Starlight Celebrity
show will be back next week

177
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:13,659
...from Hollywood, California.

178
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:16,247
Where stars make dreams...

179
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:20,460
...and dreams make stars.

180
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:25,423
How were you assholes thinking? That
was the biggest crock of shit I ever saw!

181
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:27,134
Show's popular!

182
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:28,259
Bullshit!

183
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:32,396
OH, you guys, how did it go?
Honey, you were great!

184
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:35,559
- You were amazing, how do you feel?
You were incredible. -Good...

185
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:39,105
You absolutely nailed it. Did you hear her?
Did you hear what Marilyn said?

186
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:40,899
She said you blowed! You were perfect!

187
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:44,527
So Devon, this one's off limits, right?

188
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,112
Don't even think about it...

189
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:49,825
...If I don't kill you, her husband will,
and he is THE most powerful guy around.

190
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:53,120
He knows everything. There is not a
thing he does'nt know.

191
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:55,706
I can tell you stories that
would color your hair.

192
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,417
So listen to me when I tell you.

193
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:02,173
Around Nikki, keep it in your pants.

194
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,301
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?

195
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,221
She's a nice girl, she's so far
from my style, it's not even funny.

196
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,559
Beautiful, Devon. Great.
We'll be able to sleep tonight

197
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:19,483
You gotta admit though...
She's got a nice ass.

198
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,283
It's good.
- Goodnight guys!

199
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:29,452
- Goodnight, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- OK.

200
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:32,914
- Bye!
- Let's go!

201
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,499
Good morning
Mrs. Grace.

202
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,935
Fantastic.

203
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,229
It all in the beans!

204
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:35,902
And I'm just full of beans!

205
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:39,656
Is that our set?

206
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,617
Yeah
It's not finished yet

207
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:47,163
There's Smithie's House.

208
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:49,250
Smithie's House.

209
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:10,648
I should have guessed you two professionals
would be here early and beavering away...

210
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,651
We're just laying about drinking capuccino.

211
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:16,445
Devon makes a great capuccino.

212
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:17,822
Care for one?

213
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:22,376
Thanks, but Prey and I just had a cup of tea.

214
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:26,665
Actually, it was a terrible cup of tea
at the commissary.

215
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:33,172
"Terrible" is an
adequate description of it.

216
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:54,822
Well, I thought since we're here
and Smithie site's been started...

217
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:57,575
We might go over some of the scenes
that take place there.

218
00:25:57,742 --> 00:26:00,870
Not the love scene, of course, but some of
the earlier scenes

219
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:03,914
that indicate so beautifully your character.

220
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:11,089
Lets take, for instance,
scene 35...

221
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:17,555
...the scene where Devon...
you arrive,

222
00:26:17,597 --> 00:26:24,979
...Billy, at Smithie's house to find Sue,
- Nikki- looking out the window.

223
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:26,981
I remember the scene

224
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,944
Well...

225
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:31,236
...we'll go through it...

226
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,949
...and then we'll maybe take it on
the set and plug it out as possible

227
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:36,952
I guess we should just jump right in?

228
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,328
- That would be jolly good.
- Ok

229
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:39,454
And, I'll start it off...

230
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:44,584
...on page 57.

231
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:49,464
Nikki, this is just a rough run-through
So don't be hard on yourself...

232
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:52,803
- I am expecting from you, an Academy Award
performance, right out of the gate, so...

233
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:55,180
Thanks, Devon.
Get going, please

234
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:05,024
I didn't think you'd be here...

235
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:10,405
No, of course you wouldn't

236
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,701
...that's because you...

237
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:16,078
what

238
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:19,081
what do you want?

239
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:24,295
I said some things last night
as you know.

240
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,382
Yeah.

241
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,387
And I want to apologize

242
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:35,266
- Apologize?
- Yeah.

243
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,232
The things you said weren't the truth?

244
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:45,027
I didn't say that

245
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:49,198
Were they the truth?

246
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,003
Are you crying?

247
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:04,423
Uh huh...

248
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,135
Yeah

249
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:13,934
Are you sorry about last night?

250
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,480
Are you?

251
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,276
Why are you crying?

252
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:25,906
I'm sorry, Billy.

253
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:28,616
I'm so sorry

254
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,911
what?

255
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,336
OH, shit.

256
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:45,093
Look in the other room.

257
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,721
What is that?

258
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,598
Freddy!

259
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,893
No, someone's there.

260
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:00,528
This stage is ours and ours alone.

261
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:06,993
Well, let's have a look.

262
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:19,573
Who was it?

263
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:24,036
Disappeared where it's
real hard to disappear.

264
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:34,047
Maybe we should talk,
maybe this is the time.

265
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:37,300
Let's be serious for a moment
about something other than this scene.

266
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:39,387
why?
- what is it?

267
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:40,930
Sit down, I'll tell you.

268
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:48,230
It was Freddy who
first heard about it

269
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:53,987
If you have an assistant who can hold his
liquor, then...

270
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,988
...Freddy can do that with the best of them.

271
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:59,701
Somebody's got to do it,
Gable's dead.

272
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:05,456
Now, Freddy is purposefully out and about
gathering what in this business...

273
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,626
...is the most valuable commodity...

274
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,628
...information.

275
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:14,842
Information is indispensable.
You probably know this from your own lives..

276
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:18,888
...we all have people who gather...
agents, friends, producers...

277
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:22,100
And sometimes they share,

278
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:26,313
...sometimes not.

279
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:30,693
Politics, ego,

280
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,987
...fear...

281
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:34,740
Kingsley?

282
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:38,202
sometimes I just isn't told the whole story.

283
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,207
Kingsley, get to the point.

284
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,303
"On High In Blue Tomorrows"
it is, in fact, a remake.

285
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:57,681
It's a remake?

286
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:01,227
I wouldn't do a remake.

287
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,147
No, no no, I know, of course,
But you didn't know

288
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:08,943
The original was a differrent name.
Started, but never finished.

289
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:13,532
Now, Freddy has found out
that our producers...

290
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:18,538
...Know the history of this film and have takenit upon
themselves not to pass on that information to us.

291
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,457
Purposefully

292
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:23,669
Not on me, and I assume not the two of you...

293
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:25,003
True?

294
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:27,840
No, absolutely

295
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:29,925
Nobody told me anything.

296
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:32,553
No. Me neither.

297
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:35,974
I thought this was
an original script.

298
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:38,352
Yeah, well...

299
00:32:42,022 --> 00:32:44,482
Anyway, the film
it was never finished...

300
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:48,154
Something happened before
the film was finished.

301
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:52,617
I don'tot understand.
why wasn't it finished?

302
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,208
Well, after the characters
had been filming for some time,

303
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:07,843
...they discovered something... something...
inside the history.

304
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:11,221
Please, Kingsley.

305
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:15,684
The two leads,
were murdered.

306
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:29,240
It was based on a Polish-gypsy folk tale.

307
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:32,453
The title in German was
"Fier Sieben".

308
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:33,746
"Four Seven".

309
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,542
And it was said to be cursed.

310
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:46,761
...so it turned out to be.

311
00:33:54,185 --> 00:33:55,019
What?

312
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:59,107
Did you understand what I said?

313
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:02,903
I don't understand.

314
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:04,988
Hmm, you don't speak Polish.

315
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:06,866
No.

316
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,868
Half of it...

317
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,000
I think she understands more
than she lets on...

318
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,543
But I don't speak it.

319
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:30,685
Take a seat.

320
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,946
What's this all about?

321
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:53,000
I've been hypnotized,
or something

322
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,671
Hypnotized?

323
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,301
And I'm...

324
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,141
I'm...

325
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:12,396
I'm going to kill someone.

326
00:35:13,063 --> 00:35:16,735
Oh, yeah?
Who you going to kill?

327
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:21,656
I don't know.

328
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:29,541
Who hypnotized you?

329
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:36,631
The saw him looking at me once when I...

330
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:41,262
...when I looked
around the bar, and...

331
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:45,434
He done moved his hands...

332
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:50,022
...and he said that I...

333
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,233
...which I would'nt know who I was.

334
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,987
How are you going to kill
this person?

335
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:01,158
With a screwdriver

336
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,363
Your wife...

337
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:42,454
I've been with her since
I was a little boy.

338
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,290
A little boy?

339
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:51,339
Nothin' little about you now...

340
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:56,219
As far as I heard, that is.

341
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,978
why are you doin this?

342
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:06,023
Doin what?

343
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:11,404
Don't play dumb with me, Billy.

344
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:14,157
I got husband.

345
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,285
You got a wife
and two kids.

346
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:23,334
why are you doin this?

347
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:27,004
'cause I never met you before.

348
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:29,382
what?

349
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:33,553
I didn't know you before

350
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:39,601
I never had this feeling.

351
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:43,939
You have it too...

352
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:49,195
Don't you?

353
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:56,995
I can't afford to, Billy.

354
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:03,878
All I see from this is blue tomorrows

355
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:11,178
OK, cuts.

356
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,685
That was brilliant
We're moving on...

357
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:20,145
Check the gate please.
Camera reload.

358
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:23,275
- Good, good.
- 27 for lunch.

359
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:26,862
- Did you feel good about
it? - Yeah, I felt great. - Ok

360
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:30,907
So we're going to leave this lovely weather?

361
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:36,123
- Freddy, did you have an ashtray..
- I had one...

362
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:54,225
Going well?

363
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,770
Very well, thank you, Freddy.

364
00:38:57,688 --> 00:38:59,356
Very enjoyable

365
00:39:01,316 --> 00:39:03,861
Enjoyable, yes,
thats is the word.

366
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:09,701
Are you enjoying yourself Freddy?

367
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:15,749
Well, there is a vast
network, right?

368
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,378
An ocean of possibilities

369
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,549
I like dogs.

370
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:27,387
It used to raise rabbits
I've always loved animals.

371
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:30,141
Their nature...

372
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,226
...how they think...

373
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:36,689
I saw dogs reason their way
out of problems.

374
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:41,779
watched them think through the
trickiest situation.

375
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,449
Do you have a couple of bucks I can borrow?

376
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:49,620
I've got this terrible landlord.

377
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:04,387
Thanks.

378
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,474
I got a lot of nerve, I know.

379
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:14,605
It seems like only yesterday
I was carrying my own weight.

380
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:57,820
is the 19 year old neice...

381
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:01,450
Ever since we went into pre-production,
she's been

382
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:02,909
...fascinated by Smithie.

383
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:05,121
Keeps going on and on about Smithie...

384
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:10,877
...asking in that ancient
foreign voice of hers

385
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,923
Who is playing Smithie?

386
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,494
Where did everyone go?

387
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:48,043
Sorry she taken
Mr. Berg upstairs

388
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:56,385
Alright.

389
00:42:19,953 --> 00:42:21,454
I listen to you, but...

390
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,875
...I don't hear him.

391
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,795
Excatly sure what your getting in?

392
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,549
I am going to put my arm around you

393
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:36,763
I want to hold you close. You don't mind that, do you?

394
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,685
What do you mean?

395
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:45,398
Sometimes people don't say exactly
what they mean

396
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:48,569
And you have been guilty of
this all evening.

397
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:56,368
Now, I'll tell you something.

398
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:58,121
And I will mean,

399
00:42:58,246 --> 00:43:01,666
...everything I say.

400
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:06,254
My wife is not a free agent.

401
00:43:06,463 --> 00:43:08,758
I don't allow her that.

402
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:11,886
The bonds of marriage
are real bonds.

403
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:14,304
The vows we take,

404
00:43:14,345 --> 00:43:18,350
...we honor and enforce them.

405
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:22,356
For our selves, by ourselves, or,

406
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:27,110
if necessary,
they are enforced for us.

407
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:29,946
Either way, she is...

408
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:31,699
...bound.

409
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,036
Do you understand this?

410
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,796
There are consequences to one's actions.

411
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:48,468
And there would, for certain, be consequences to...

412
00:43:48,717 --> 00:43:50,804
...wrong actions.

413
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,349
Dark, they would be, and...

414
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,436
...inescapable.

415
00:44:01,524 --> 00:44:04,235
why instigate a need to suffer?

416
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:34,685
Bucky J, are you there?

417
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,397
- Is he there?
- Yes, he is there.

418
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,735
I'd say we haven't still got the 2K quite in the right place

419
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,070
I think I'd say up about 2 feet, you'd know better than me.

420
00:44:44,697 --> 00:44:46,073
But it's still...

421
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,368
Boss, you want the 2K down?

422
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:51,288
Want it down?

423
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:56,293
Yeah, I'd say about 2 foot down Bucky.

424
00:44:56,918 --> 00:44:59,087
How much you want it to do down?

425
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:01,590
Yeah, a bit more...

426
00:45:01,673 --> 00:45:04,427
- Keep...
- How far?

427
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,387
Another foot Bucky.

428
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:08,973
I haven't even touched it yet.

429
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:14,104
Well then put it 2 foot from where it is...
no, a foot down from where it is Bucky.

430
00:45:14,938 --> 00:45:16,399
"... oss".

431
00:45:16,691 --> 00:45:17,733
What?

432
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,570
Got it, boss.

433
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,619
Bucky, I... Bucky just lower it 2 foot, would you?

434
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:27,751
From there.

435
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:29,872
No, Bucky.
It's going up.

436
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:32,957
I want it down, Bucky,
Two foot lower.

437
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:35,461
This goddamn time I had a cramp

438
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,129
Just a minute, I'm getting on it...

439
00:45:43,011 --> 00:45:44,221
Thank you Bucky.

440
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:46,515
Does we it in something else...
- go talk to him...

441
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:52,271
Just uh... relax for a minute.

442
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,117
Listen, get medics on the scene, and see what's behind this.

443
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:05,995
- Yes, but. who..

444
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:07,579
...Phil's on it.

445
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:10,834
- Phil's in... We got Phil up there now, Bucky J doin a deal.
- Ok

446
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,253
- Please guys, lets work on these lighting cues,
alright, we need to work together...

447
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:21,469
We're almost lit,
couple of minutets

448
00:46:21,594 --> 00:46:23,849
Alright, Tim and Sally, five minute warning,
five minute warning.

449
00:46:23,974 --> 00:46:29,271
Last looks on first team please,
five minute warning.

450
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:32,941
Lockups go to place please,
lockups to place.

451
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:41,451
I'm heading out, you need anything?

452
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:44,203
Quittin time already?

453
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:46,373
Passed.

454
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:54,506
Wanna stay for a drink?

455
00:46:54,798 --> 00:46:58,470
Naw, I'm late for gym.
- Gym?

456
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:03,475
Is that with a 'g' or a 'j'?

457
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:05,269
Oh, that's original.

458
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,689
'G'

459
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,026
what do you do...

460
00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:14,529
...at the gym?

461
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,947
I exercise!

462
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:20,160
why would you do that?

463
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:22,330
See ya

464
00:47:24,332 --> 00:47:27,126
Stay for one little drink?

465
00:47:28,294 --> 00:47:30,796
I'm so lonely...

466
00:47:31,506 --> 00:47:34,885
Oh, poor small infant child...

467
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,891
One?

468
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:47,190
Damn

469
00:47:57,618 --> 00:48:00,329
Will there be anything else?

470
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,210
- No, thank you, Jim.
- My pleasure.

471
00:48:24,189 --> 00:48:26,692
You want to stay for dinner?

472
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:29,946
Maybe

473
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,323
I think you should.

474
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:34,826
You do?

475
00:48:36,286 --> 00:48:37,704
I really do.

476
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,297
This is a nice drink.

477
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,384
Nice fire.

478
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,182
wife and children gone..

479
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,274
You talk too much.

480
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:09,447
So sorry, baby.

481
00:49:12,493 --> 00:49:15,705
Don't ruin this...

482
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:23,004
There's nothing to ruin Billy.

483
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:37,771
Done cut.

484
00:49:37,896 --> 00:49:41,066
We copy cut.
Check gate.

485
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:52,329
Yeah, I was right. Did anyone else read
the script?

486
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:56,792
The light should fade after Billy's line, do you see?

487
00:49:58,209 --> 00:49:59,168
Look.

488
00:49:59,252 --> 00:50:02,924
Alright alright, we go again please!
Back to 1 everybody!

489
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:13,227
A car...

490
00:50:13,436 --> 00:50:16,564
A click Al, it wasn't a car, it was a 'click'.

491
00:50:16,731 --> 00:50:18,691
Guys on lockup outside, can we work on that please?

492
00:50:18,774 --> 00:50:23,821
Really, I can't have cars going by without...
No, we had ITC...

493
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:27,243
I don't think it was... It's something in the wire...
Will you pick that up?

494
00:50:33,457 --> 00:50:37,045
Thanks. I've got a lot of nerve, I know...

495
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:41,508
...it seems that only yesterday Iwas carrying my own weight.

496
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:44,636
Thanks, Devon.

497
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,722
My pleasure...

498
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,853
That is exactly what we need.

499
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:01,405
- Camera department, you guys ready?
- Yeah

500
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,741
- OK.
- Where you gonna go sir?

501
00:51:03,783 --> 00:51:04,658
Can I have some coffee?

502
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,369
Yeah, coffee comming in..

503
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:14,461
After shooting, do you want to go get
something to eat with me?

504
00:51:21,552 --> 00:51:25,516
I bet you know a cute little Italian resaurant.

505
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:28,643
Tucked away

506
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:32,480
Private,
Great food.

507
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:37,486
I do!

508
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,032
How did you know that?

509
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:45,079
Did I say a night?

510
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:56,258
They're ready for you.

511
00:51:56,341 --> 00:51:59,261
Wait just a minute.

512
00:52:12,108 --> 00:52:15,529
I'll see you after the shoot.

513
00:52:22,536 --> 00:52:24,038
Good luck
and run...

514
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:26,790
And action!

515
00:53:10,297 --> 00:53:11,632
Billy.

516
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,108
Is it this what you want?

517
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:37,744
I won't fall in love with you.

518
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:03,816
And cut!

519
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,195
Are you two happy?

520
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:26,924
What?

521
00:54:29,009 --> 00:54:30,136
I don't know.

522
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:35,057
Tell me.

523
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:38,646
What?

524
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:42,692
Something's happened.

525
00:54:43,526 --> 00:54:46,028
I think my husband
knows about you.

526
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:48,406
About us

527
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,117
He'll kill you...
and me...

528
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:52,995
He'll...

529
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,166
Damn... it sounds like dialogue from our script!

530
00:55:00,419 --> 00:55:01,797
Cut. Cut it!

531
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:04,381
What's going on?

532
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,677
What?

533
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:12,600
What the bloody hell is going on?

534
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,536
And we just don't know the actual, real reasons.

535
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,955
...why this film wasn't finished.

536
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,710
Now, you know some stories,

537
00:55:36,794 --> 00:55:40,046
But stories are stories.
Hollywood is full of them.

538
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:41,257
Thank God.

539
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:43,716
In this case, the same thing.

540
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,721
Stories which grew out of imagination.

541
00:55:47,305 --> 00:55:51,101
And we're surrounded by these
old stories every day

542
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:55,897
And they shouldn't be taken as truth.
Or given creedence.

543
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:59,610
Or jeapordize Nikki's performance.

544
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:03,405
Unless the stories are true.

545
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,575
Devon...

546
00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:15,502
There is absolutely no proof that anyting
bad happened around this film.

547
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:50,416
Tie me on and I'll come.

548
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,799
Wait, stop, stop baby...

549
00:56:52,834 --> 00:56:54,754
OH, God! Oh yeah. Oh God Damn.

550
00:57:03,764 --> 00:57:05,314
Ok, our first time...

551
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:07,936
...fuck and it's good.
OH, please

552
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:09,687
Babe, you talk too fuckin' much.

553
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:14,692
- Are you gonna talk through this whole thing?.
- Oh yeah.

554
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,952
It's time.

555
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:43,934
Remember...

556
00:57:44,518 --> 00:57:46,310
Rembember that thing

557
00:57:46,394 --> 00:57:51,107
When I said that thing
about me...

558
00:57:51,525 --> 00:57:53,194
Remember that?

559
00:57:53,278 --> 00:57:55,488
Yeah...

560
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:03,830
Remember I told you, about this thing
this thing that happened.

561
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:11,005
It's a story that
happened yesterday.

562
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:13,925
But I know that it's tomorrow.

563
00:58:14,551 --> 00:58:16,094
That doesn't make sense

564
00:58:16,344 --> 00:58:17,304
It was that scene...

565
00:58:17,804 --> 00:58:19,390
...that we did yesterday.

566
00:58:19,557 --> 00:58:22,392
When I'm getting groceries for you
with your car

567
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:25,937
And I was in that alley, and I parked the
car, there's always parking there.

568
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:28,025
...So there I am...

569
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:31,694
What?
Sue, damn!

570
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:37,075
It's a scene we did yesterday.

571
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:39,078
You weren't in it.

572
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:44,584
That one where I'm in the alley, I'm going to get
groceries for you with your car.

573
00:58:44,918 --> 00:58:47,295
And I parked there 'cause there's always
parking.

574
00:58:47,712 --> 00:58:49,506
You know the one?

575
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:52,475
I see this writing on metal.

576
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:56,889
And I started remembering something...
I'm remembering...

577
00:58:56,972 --> 00:59:01,185
This whole thing starts floodin' in...
this whole memory.

578
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:07,317
I start to remember...
And I... I don't know...

579
00:59:07,526 --> 00:59:11,154
I do not know what it is...

580
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:16,494
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

581
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:18,789
That doesn't make any sense

582
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:21,917
What is this?

583
00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:28,091
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

584
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:31,719
Look at me, you fucker!

585
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,984
Please, please

586
00:59:45,276 --> 00:59:46,944
Please

587
00:59:47,445 --> 00:59:49,156
Forgive me.

588
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,619
Please

589
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,258
Look in the other room...

590
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,968
What the hell is that?

591
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:02,510
Freddy!

592
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,972
No, somebody's over there.

593
01:02:10,103 --> 01:02:13,231
The stage is supposed to be ours and ours alone.

594
01:02:18,154 --> 01:02:19,572
I'll go look

595
01:02:22,825 --> 01:02:24,911
- I'm sorry
- It's ok..

596
01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:27,856
Billy!

597
01:03:32,193 --> 01:03:33,027
Billy!

598
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,489
Billy!

599
01:04:10,235 --> 01:04:11,570
Billy!

600
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:18,036
Billy!

601
01:04:21,664 --> 01:04:23,251
Billy!

602
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:29,424
Billy!

603
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:21,872
Who the hell are you?

604
01:09:26,043 --> 01:09:27,628
Hey!

605
01:09:28,045 --> 01:09:31,591
Look at us and tell us
if you've known us before.

606
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,304
There was a man...

607
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,389
...I once knew

608
01:09:42,437 --> 01:09:46,399
Was it like this.. look around.

609
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:53,157
Did he do that thing... you know
that little shaking thing?

610
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:56,453
While he was...

611
01:09:56,494 --> 01:09:59,206
You know...

612
01:10:02,334 --> 01:10:04,336
Wasn't that great...

613
01:10:06,296 --> 01:10:07,756
Yeah

614
01:10:14,348 --> 01:10:15,806
I'd let him do...

615
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:19,770
...anything

616
01:10:44,672 --> 01:10:46,424
Strange...

617
01:10:46,633 --> 01:10:48,009
...what love does.

618
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:57,311
So strange.

619
01:11:03,652 --> 01:11:05,236
In the bedroom

620
01:11:07,824 --> 01:11:12,912
- You'll be dreaming...
- The kind of sleep...

621
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:17,835
When you open the eyes...

622
01:11:18,335 --> 01:11:22,298
someone familiar will be there.

623
01:12:08,097 --> 01:12:09,849
This is the street.

624
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:18,400
Do you want to see?

625
01:12:29,664 --> 01:12:32,833
Just down the way.

626
01:13:05,662 --> 01:13:07,746
It was...

627
01:13:07,788 --> 01:13:09,708
...to see...

628
01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:16,090
Very pretty...

629
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,050
I know...

630
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:24,308
Pick a cigarette.

631
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:28,061
Erase him in the white silk.

632
01:13:34,736 --> 01:13:36,821
Arrive closer

633
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:39,449
It approximate

634
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:45,289
And it look...

635
01:13:45,331 --> 01:13:48,500
...through
of the hole.

636
01:15:54,765 --> 01:15:56,643
Breakfast

637
01:18:08,996 --> 01:18:12,126
I didn't mean anything by that.
I just asked a question.

638
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:16,798
Why did you ask if it means nothing?
Whatever you want, is that it?

639
01:18:17,048 --> 01:18:18,966
No, whatever you want.

640
01:18:19,509 --> 01:18:22,136
Oh... Now it's me!

641
01:18:23,513 --> 01:18:25,266
Always you.

642
01:18:26,308 --> 01:18:30,479
Lie to me, but don't lie to yourself.
So sly...

643
01:18:32,272 --> 01:18:35,694
- Don't push me!
- I'll push you to hell!

644
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:36,944
Stop it!

645
01:18:38,071 --> 01:18:40,282
I can't give you children, I know that...

646
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,162
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm going out now.

647
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:51,420
I'm not who you think I am!
I'll never let you have her!

648
01:19:00,513 --> 01:19:01,888
Never!

649
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:07,477
Never!

650
01:19:29,377 --> 01:19:33,132
- Excuse me, do you know the time?
- 9:45.

651
01:19:33,466 --> 01:19:35,217
Thank you.

652
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:10,555
I don't really understand
what I'm doing here.

653
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:18,898
That's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

654
01:22:21,526 --> 01:22:25,781
So I was told you could help me.

655
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:40,089
I guess I'll just tell you the thing..

656
01:22:41,215 --> 01:22:44,760
I just know that am I.

657
01:23:03,615 --> 01:23:05,617
There was this man...

658
01:23:07,286 --> 01:23:11,206
...I once knew...

659
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:13,667
His name was...

660
01:23:15,002 --> 01:23:18,297
It doesn't matter what his name was...

661
01:23:20,843 --> 01:23:24,262
A lot of guys change.

662
01:23:24,721 --> 01:23:26,974
They don't change, but they reveal

663
01:23:29,393 --> 01:23:32,188
In time they reveal
what they really are.

664
01:23:32,647 --> 01:23:35,859
You know what I mean?

665
01:23:37,693 --> 01:23:41,281
It is an old story.

666
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:44,953
Well this guy...

667
01:23:45,828 --> 01:23:48,873
...he revealed something.

668
01:23:50,541 --> 01:23:52,543
Looking back on it...

669
01:23:55,254 --> 01:23:58,884
All along it was being revealed.

670
01:24:02,012 --> 01:24:05,267
He was planning something...

671
01:24:06,059 --> 01:24:09,729
...planning something with me
in mind.

672
01:24:21,826 --> 01:24:25,914
When I get mad,
I really get mad

673
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:32,797
I gouged a man's eye out when I
was 15 once, he was trying to rape me...

674
01:24:32,922 --> 01:24:35,925
I mean, the fucker had it out
pushing my legs apart.

675
01:24:38,011 --> 01:24:40,179
I got a finger on his eyes socket,

676
01:24:40,513 --> 01:24:44,268
pretty quick, rape was quite a long
way off his mind.

677
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:49,481
He was crying and screaming like a baby.

678
01:24:50,317 --> 01:24:53,236
"What a fuckin man you are," I said.

679
01:24:57,324 --> 01:24:58,825
There was goo...

680
01:24:59,785 --> 01:25:02,912
He still could still see
me with the one eye.

681
01:25:03,121 --> 01:25:07,918
See me comin' at him, grabbin' his nuts
and tearin' at 'em.

682
01:25:09,796 --> 01:25:12,381
He'd seen that alright, felt it too.

683
01:25:13,759 --> 01:25:17,012
He was screamin' and wailin' like a little baby.

684
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:22,101
He sat in the corner cryin'

685
01:25:22,393 --> 01:25:26,272
Alone and huggin' his nuts 'till the ambulance come

686
01:25:27,608 --> 01:25:30,526
the ambulance guys, they say:

687
01:25:30,652 --> 01:25:33,781
"What the fuck happened here?"

688
01:25:35,908 --> 01:25:37,034
I say:

689
01:25:37,242 --> 01:25:41,081
..."He come to a reapin' what he had been sowin', that's what. "

690
01:25:42,332 --> 01:25:43,667
They say:

691
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:48,296
"Fucker been sowing some kind of heavy shit... "

692
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,430
It's the shits...

693
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:40,104
I really thought you would last, you two.

694
01:26:42,189 --> 01:26:44,900
I saw it coming...

695
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:49,990
Sorry, I did!

696
01:26:51,575 --> 01:26:54,620
You're full of shit Dorry...

697
01:27:05,299 --> 01:27:07,009
Sucks... He was the one...

698
01:27:08,052 --> 01:27:11,473
I really thought he was,
you know?

699
01:27:16,269 --> 01:27:19,189
So what
He's gone

700
01:27:21,274 --> 01:27:23,278
Find someone else

701
01:27:26,697 --> 01:27:29,825
It is not easy
when you feel like shit...

702
01:27:32,162 --> 01:27:34,331
OH, baby...

703
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,631
Tonight we'll change that.

704
01:27:42,256 --> 01:27:44,841
Yeah. Tonight
it will be good.

705
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:49,013
There's always a chance
with tits like yours, Kerri.

706
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:51,642
Thanks

707
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,313
Tits

708
01:27:56,856 --> 01:27:58,607
Tits and ass.

709
01:28:10,746 --> 01:28:14,792
These are going to bring 'em
in like sin

710
01:28:16,961 --> 01:28:21,550
- Pretty.
- Let me see 'em

711
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:27,598
They are pretty baby,
Nice.

712
01:28:29,683 --> 01:28:31,060
Sweet.

713
01:28:31,145 --> 01:28:32,521
Thanks guys

714
01:29:24,327 --> 01:29:27,538
I started saving some money
- Oh

715
01:29:28,707 --> 01:29:31,628
So now we rich?

716
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:35,048
so I drink this piss called beer.

717
01:29:37,383 --> 01:29:39,844
What is the money for?

718
01:29:40,054 --> 01:29:44,141
If it won't bring something like hope?

719
01:30:01,952 --> 01:30:04,998
I'm pregnant.

720
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,879
Oh... Funny one!

721
01:30:13,631 --> 01:30:16,760
I am pregnant.

722
01:30:24,394 --> 01:30:26,479
What is this?

723
01:30:28,107 --> 01:30:30,526
You don't seem too happy about it!

724
01:30:38,994 --> 01:30:41,038
Your pregnant?

725
01:30:49,172 --> 01:30:52,133
What is it?

726
01:30:53,176 --> 01:30:55,429
What's wrong?

727
01:31:02,353 --> 01:31:04,731
It just that it come as a shock to me

728
01:32:29,282 --> 01:32:30,450
Hello?

729
01:32:33,037 --> 01:32:34,621
Hello?

730
01:33:05,489 --> 01:33:06,823
Billy?

731
01:33:32,603 --> 01:33:36,774
I seen a man come at me with
a crow bar once.

732
01:33:37,483 --> 01:33:41,697
Guess he figured I was two-timing him.

733
01:33:43,531 --> 01:33:45,324
I was coming home.

734
01:33:45,742 --> 01:33:49,078
We were shacked up at the time.

735
01:33:54,001 --> 01:33:57,505
He was waiting for me in the half-light.

736
01:34:01,259 --> 01:34:03,469
Waitin' for me to come home.

737
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:07,516
I guess he worked himself
into some kind of frenzy.

738
01:34:07,807 --> 01:34:11,186
I opened the fuckin' door.

739
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:15,649
And I seen his fuckin' shape burst out
of the chair...

740
01:34:16,986 --> 01:34:18,570
and a crow-bar goin up

741
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:23,033
I screamed and turned

742
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,996
Fuckin' crow bar comes down...

743
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:31,293
...smashin' into that fuckin' door

744
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:33,711
...cheap piece of shit...

745
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:36,840
...it just splinters into 1000 pieces

746
01:34:36,923 --> 01:34:40,345
...like it was glass, shit flyin' everywhere

747
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:44,140
I don't take this kind
of behavior.

748
01:34:49,228 --> 01:34:51,523
I seen what this fucko is up to

749
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,484
Bam!

750
01:34:55,486 --> 01:34:58,405
I kick him in the nuts so hard that
they go crawling into his brain

751
01:34:58,489 --> 01:35:00,199
...for refuge.

752
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:03,411
He goes down like a $2 whore.

753
01:35:03,703 --> 01:35:08,416
...cryin' and shit and tell me that he's
never done nothing but love me bullshit...

754
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,301
Were you in fact seeing another man?

755
01:35:19,053 --> 01:35:22,723
I was screwing a couple guys for drinks,
no big deal.

756
01:35:27,813 --> 01:35:30,650
This one guy, he was kinda cute

757
01:35:31,234 --> 01:35:36,531
Fucker had a dick like a rhinocerous.
He'd fuck the shit out of you, I'll tell you what...

758
01:35:42,955 --> 01:35:45,207
He'd buy me a couple of drinks after.

759
01:35:50,547 --> 01:35:52,132
We'd talk.

760
01:35:52,215 --> 01:35:55,552
He'd tell me about a town he grew up in.

761
01:35:55,845 --> 01:35:59,515
All the little girls he'd fuck

762
01:36:00,767 --> 01:36:03,894
There was a chemical factory in this town
and, uh...

763
01:36:05,772 --> 01:36:09,735
Telling us it was putting so much shit
in the air you couldn't think straight.

764
01:36:12,863 --> 01:36:15,241
I got to a lot of the people.

765
01:36:17,743 --> 01:36:21,204
there was a lot of crazy shit going on there.

766
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:25,793
People having weird dreams, and...

767
01:36:28,172 --> 01:36:31,090
...seeing things that wasn't there.

768
01:36:33,845 --> 01:36:37,265
So one time, this one little girl...

769
01:36:39,893 --> 01:36:42,145
...she was starin' off at somethin' one time...

770
01:36:42,562 --> 01:36:44,647
...starts screaming

771
01:36:45,483 --> 01:36:49,653
They.. the... people hanging around,
they come to her and

772
01:36:49,695 --> 01:36:53,616
...ask her what's wrong, and uh...

773
01:36:57,579 --> 01:37:00,332
She says she sees the end of the world.

774
01:37:03,001 --> 01:37:06,129
...on fire, and smoke
and blood rain".

775
01:37:06,672 --> 01:37:09,677
You know, like they say...

776
01:37:11,678 --> 01:37:15,390
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

777
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,145
Hey!

778
01:37:24,484 --> 01:37:25,944
Look at me!

779
01:37:26,903 --> 01:37:30,030
And I tell me if you've known me before.

780
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:37,832
Yes,
we will do that.

781
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:52,222
Where is the paper towels?

782
01:38:13,455 --> 01:38:16,624
They're behind you, on the table.

783
01:38:29,973 --> 01:38:35,103
It removes myself...
from this sinful dream...

784
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:41,235
...which invaded
my heart.

785
01:40:08,373 --> 01:40:09,041
Who is she?

786
01:40:16,842 --> 01:40:18,384
Who is she?

787
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:53,215
I almost didn't recognize you

788
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,679
You startled me

789
01:41:01,265 --> 01:41:04,727
Strange... to find you on the street

790
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,694
You seem upset.

791
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:16,073
Are you?

792
01:41:17,324 --> 01:41:19,118
Should I be?

793
01:41:21,788 --> 01:41:24,417
- No, but...
- So I shouldn't be?

794
01:41:27,544 --> 01:41:28,587
No

795
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,589
But still, you seem so

796
01:41:34,344 --> 01:41:36,053
I think you don't recognize me

797
01:41:40,225 --> 01:41:42,477
I think you don't recognize my manners

798
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:47,483
That's true

799
01:41:48,693 --> 01:41:51,946
- You seem different
- You too

800
01:41:58,078 --> 01:42:02,166
I'm used to seeing you in our home,
not on the street,

801
01:42:04,502 --> 01:42:06,128
at night

802
01:42:08,214 --> 01:42:10,300
Me too

803
01:42:19,144 --> 01:42:20,686
There was a murder

804
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:27,194
How awful!

805
01:42:28,737 --> 01:42:31,114
- Where?
- Just down the way

806
01:42:32,825 --> 01:42:34,285
I think...

807
01:42:35,327 --> 01:42:36,954
...you knew the victim

808
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:43,003
- Who was it?
- Don't know the name

809
01:42:45,756 --> 01:42:48,133
But I have seen you with this person

810
01:42:52,846 --> 01:42:54,599
- You have?
- Yes

811
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:59,271
I think I've seen the two of you together

812
01:43:09,532 --> 01:43:10,783
That's awful

813
01:43:40,066 --> 01:43:42,152
Who are those people?

814
01:43:42,485 --> 01:43:44,571
Hey, hello!

815
01:43:45,822 --> 01:43:46,865
Good to see you.

816
01:43:47,908 --> 01:43:49,367
Come in, come in.

817
01:43:49,409 --> 01:43:52,288
Get some hot-dog.

818
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:58,128
You said 3 o'clock.

819
01:43:58,961 --> 01:44:00,921
Yes, that's right.

820
01:44:01,883 --> 01:44:03,342
You're right on time.

821
01:44:06,512 --> 01:44:08,680
The situation is becoming dangerous

822
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:15,814
Give me my hammer.

823
01:44:15,939 --> 01:44:17,483
Give me that!

824
01:44:18,233 --> 01:44:20,069
Gives me now.

825
01:44:26,034 --> 01:44:29,162
Did you see?

826
01:44:44,303 --> 01:44:46,807
There is no paper.
For the toilet.

827
01:44:47,307 --> 01:44:48,767
There is no paper.

828
01:44:49,935 --> 01:44:54,189
It is under the sink,
in the cupboard.

829
01:45:07,121 --> 01:45:08,579
what?

830
01:45:13,168 --> 01:45:16,714
They are a group that performs in
travelling shows.

831
01:45:16,923 --> 01:45:19,717
In the Baltic region

832
01:45:22,471 --> 01:45:25,891
What's that got to do with you?

833
01:45:26,642 --> 01:45:29,854
I will care for the animals.

834
01:45:36,446 --> 01:45:40,282
It was said that I have a way with animals.

835
01:45:50,002 --> 01:45:53,421
Fucker went to some eastern
europe shithole

836
01:45:53,964 --> 01:45:57,050
...with the fuckin' circus.

837
01:46:00,013 --> 01:46:02,891
Can you fuckin believe that?

838
01:46:06,269 --> 01:46:08,021
That circus...

839
01:46:08,355 --> 01:46:13,444
...talk about carnies... Carnies, gypsies,
conmen, you name it.

840
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:17,406
A real fuckin' ball of shit.

841
01:46:24,706 --> 01:46:27,417
There was this guy they had working there.

842
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,006
He'd start talkin'.

843
01:46:33,049 --> 01:46:35,552
...you know, real regular.

844
01:46:36,803 --> 01:46:38,346
Talkin' up the crowd.

845
01:46:38,889 --> 01:46:40,891
They'd start listening...

846
01:46:41,182 --> 01:46:44,229
...Pushin' in closer.

847
01:46:45,355 --> 01:46:48,566
He did some sort of thing on people.

848
01:46:52,236 --> 01:46:55,241
They all called him the phantom.

849
01:46:59,662 --> 01:47:03,207
He got in a bar room fight one night...

850
01:47:03,833 --> 01:47:05,709
All the bar was arrested.

851
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:09,214
A lot of them fuckin' circus clowns.

852
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:15,720
So when they take 'em all down to the station,

853
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:18,099
Guess what?...

854
01:47:19,977 --> 01:47:22,186
...the Phantom's done gone and disappeared.

855
01:47:22,603 --> 01:47:25,690
This is the kind of
shit I'm talking about.

856
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:37,912
He was a marine from North Carolina.

857
01:47:41,876 --> 01:47:44,503
I had a sister with one leg.

858
01:47:44,587 --> 01:47:49,049
...she had a sort of carved stick for the other one.

859
01:47:53,263 --> 01:47:57,517
She killed three kids in the first grade.

860
01:47:57,642 --> 01:48:01,146
This is the kind of shit.

861
01:48:12,116 --> 01:48:13,786
Fuckin' funny.

862
01:48:17,874 --> 01:48:19,417
People.

863
01:48:20,793 --> 01:48:23,379
All got their own peculiarities.

864
01:48:24,339 --> 01:48:27,134
Their own way of livin'

865
01:50:50,626 --> 01:50:51,669
What about school?

866
01:50:52,627 --> 01:50:53,753
One more day.

867
01:50:55,423 --> 01:50:56,341
One more day?

868
01:50:57,383 --> 01:50:58,759
Maybe two.

869
01:51:08,353 --> 01:51:10,106
Susan?

870
01:51:11,482 --> 01:51:13,860
What are you doing here?

871
01:51:18,657 --> 01:51:19,199
What?

872
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:22,202
I thought you were gone.

873
01:51:33,798 --> 01:51:34,632
Billy.

874
01:51:38,052 --> 01:51:39,095
Billy.

875
01:51:41,724 --> 01:51:42,975
Something's wrong.

876
01:51:43,017 --> 01:51:45,270
Bad wrong.
Do you feel it?

877
01:51:52,151 --> 01:51:53,195
Sue?

878
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:55,490
Billy.

879
01:51:56,615 --> 01:51:57,783
Do you love me?

880
01:51:59,243 --> 01:52:00,578
what?

881
01:52:05,292 --> 01:52:06,209
Billy.

882
01:52:07,169 --> 01:52:08,295
Sue.

883
01:52:10,506 --> 01:52:14,343
Don't you remember anything?
How it was?

884
01:52:16,012 --> 01:52:19,057
I don't understand what you're talking about.

885
01:52:21,351 --> 01:52:22,685
Are you kidding?

886
01:52:23,645 --> 01:52:24,979
No.

887
01:52:27,817 --> 01:52:29,485
You go on, Sue.

888
01:52:29,986 --> 01:52:31,153
You go on now...

889
01:52:31,987 --> 01:52:33,864
Would you like me to call the police?

890
01:52:34,908 --> 01:52:36,784
No, we can handle this.

891
01:52:45,128 --> 01:52:45,926
Billy.

892
01:52:45,961 --> 01:52:47,295
Something is wrong

893
01:52:48,339 --> 01:52:50,341
I love you, Billy.

894
01:52:50,758 --> 01:52:54,388
I've had just enough.

895
01:52:56,682 --> 01:52:58,142
I love you

896
01:53:00,852 --> 01:53:02,730
Go away, Susan.

897
01:53:02,939 --> 01:53:04,524
I love you

898
01:53:06,484 --> 01:53:07,735
Sue!

899
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:11,197
I don't care

900
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:14,536
It's something more.

901
01:53:21,292 --> 01:53:24,963
I do not care
It's something more.

902
01:55:25,513 --> 01:55:26,848
Gordy

903
01:55:32,188 --> 01:55:33,646
What do you want?

904
01:55:37,568 --> 01:55:39,069
Where is he?

905
01:55:40,112 --> 01:55:43,450
What's the point?
Are you blind? He's gone!

906
01:55:47,413 --> 01:55:48,872
Everybody?

907
01:55:51,876 --> 01:55:54,796
Why answer your stupid question?

908
01:55:55,338 --> 01:55:57,840
You're nothing! You've done nothing!

909
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:06,267
Where did he go?

910
01:56:08,477 --> 01:56:12,815
No idea. He talked... mumbled
something about Inland Empire.

911
01:58:04,648 --> 01:58:08,610
I come about an unpaid bill that needs payin'

912
01:58:14,325 --> 01:58:16,202
All right

913
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:28,215
Do you know a man who lives here?

914
01:58:47,612 --> 01:58:48,947
Do you know him?

915
01:58:50,114 --> 01:58:53,243
Yes. What is it? What do you want?

916
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:56,788
Which you want?

917
01:59:00,542 --> 01:59:05,130
He has an unpaid bill that needs payin'

918
01:59:05,965 --> 01:59:10,012
You already said that.

919
01:59:15,017 --> 01:59:17,019
Do you know a man who lives next door?

920
01:59:17,936 --> 01:59:20,856
Crimp is the name...

921
01:59:29,616 --> 01:59:32,244
It was a funny name.

922
01:59:33,163 --> 01:59:37,042
They was called Crimp.

923
02:00:06,657 --> 02:00:07,992
Hey?

924
02:01:45,099 --> 02:01:47,435
There's someone there

925
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:51,023
I have to tell you

926
02:01:52,775 --> 02:01:54,485
There's someone

927
02:02:10,127 --> 02:02:11,587
Do you recognize her?

928
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:19,596
I don't see her

929
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:25,018
You understand she was sent for you?

930
02:02:26,396 --> 02:02:27,939
I don't know where I am

931
02:02:41,495 --> 02:02:44,206
- I hear her now
- Do you see her?

932
02:02:46,917 --> 02:02:48,086
No

933
02:02:50,381 --> 02:02:52,048
It was...

934
02:02:56,012 --> 02:02:57,262
...red

935
02:03:04,438 --> 02:03:06,230
You work for someone?

936
02:03:09,651 --> 02:03:11,111
Yes

937
02:03:13,531 --> 02:03:16,116
The one she spoke of

938
02:03:21,121 --> 02:03:23,209
Yes, I work for him

939
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:26,462
So you understand

940
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:33,010
The horse was taken...

941
02:03:34,679 --> 02:03:36,681
...to the well

942
02:03:53,242 --> 02:03:54,910
Take the pistol

943
02:03:58,373 --> 02:03:59,832
Let's go!

944
02:04:12,972 --> 02:04:15,473
Right away! It's past midnight!

945
02:05:28,972 --> 02:05:33,144
I am going to find out one day.

946
02:05:37,524 --> 02:05:39,399
It was red.

947
02:05:44,739 --> 02:05:46,283
Where was I?

948
02:05:52,541 --> 02:05:56,711
This isn't the way it was.

949
02:06:11,435 --> 02:06:15,065
It was the man in the green coat.

950
02:06:17,986 --> 02:06:22,907
It had something to do with
the telling of time.

951
02:07:37,239 --> 02:07:38,991
I am a whore.

952
02:07:44,539 --> 02:07:46,541
Where am I?

953
02:07:46,624 --> 02:07:49,002
I'm afraid

954
02:09:50,511 --> 02:09:54,559
Just a moment.

955
02:09:58,563 --> 02:10:01,565
I need to make a collect call.

956
02:11:24,573 --> 02:11:26,368
Look at me

957
02:11:28,037 --> 02:11:30,413
And tell me if you've known me before

958
02:12:13,295 --> 02:12:17,466
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

959
02:12:27,894 --> 02:12:29,854
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

960
02:12:29,979 --> 02:12:32,024
You gotta let me in. I know
a girl.

961
02:12:32,149 --> 02:12:34,944
Carolina.
I know Carolina.

962
02:14:50,718 --> 02:14:55,933
- I don't really understand what I'm doing.
- It's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

963
02:14:58,895 --> 02:15:01,146
There was this man...

964
02:15:02,189 --> 02:15:06,069
...I once knew

965
02:15:09,490 --> 02:15:13,160
I'm trying to tell you so you understand
how it went.

966
02:15:17,249 --> 02:15:19,834
The thing is, I don't know...

967
02:15:19,917 --> 02:15:23,588
...what was before or after.

968
02:15:28,803 --> 02:15:31,389
I don't know what's happened first...

969
02:15:31,931 --> 02:15:35,559
...and it's kinda layin' a mindfuck on me.

970
02:15:46,321 --> 02:15:47,030
My husband...

971
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:50,910
...he's fuckin' hidin' somethin'

972
02:15:51,953 --> 02:15:55,373
He was acting all fuckin' weird one
night before he left...

973
02:16:00,795 --> 02:16:04,550
He was talkin this foreign talk and...

974
02:16:06,136 --> 02:16:09,471
...tellin' loud fuckin' stories...

975
02:16:23,112 --> 02:16:25,616
I'm not who you think I am.

976
02:16:28,536 --> 02:16:29,912
Are you listening to me?

977
02:16:33,124 --> 02:16:35,334
I know it for a fact.

978
02:16:36,878 --> 02:16:40,965
I can't father children.

979
02:16:43,968 --> 02:16:49,808
Like this... his face all red...
his eyes buggin' out...

980
02:17:20,801 --> 02:17:23,388
I figured one day...

981
02:17:24,847 --> 02:17:26,934
...I'd just wake up and...

982
02:17:27,142 --> 02:17:31,312
...I find out what the hell yesterday
was all about.

983
02:17:35,693 --> 02:17:39,571
I'm not too keen on thinking about tomorrow.

984
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:44,159
And today's slippin' by.

985
02:18:03,765 --> 02:18:06,143
I guess after my son died,

986
02:18:07,729 --> 02:18:08,855
I went into a bad time.

987
02:18:11,984 --> 02:18:17,197
When I was watching everything go around me
while I was standing in the middle.

988
02:18:24,288 --> 02:18:28,667
Watchin it, like in a dark theater.

989
02:18:31,297 --> 02:18:33,673
before they bring lights up.

990
02:18:39,096 --> 02:18:40,890
...I'm sittin there,

991
02:18:42,642 --> 02:18:44,311
...wonderin...

992
02:18:46,812 --> 02:18:49,232
..."how can this be?"

993
02:19:32,613 --> 02:19:33,949
Hello?

994
02:19:34,366 --> 02:19:37,828
Yeah, she's still here.

995
02:19:40,956 --> 02:19:43,334
I don't think it will be too much longer now.

996
02:19:46,044 --> 02:19:47,714
Yeah, the horse to the well.

997
02:19:49,173 --> 02:19:51,260
Yeah.

998
02:19:54,388 --> 02:19:58,475
Yeah, he's around here someplace.

999
02:20:01,895 --> 02:20:05,650
Sure, I'm on it.

1000
02:20:58,124 --> 02:21:00,002
What have you been up to?

1001
02:21:00,419 --> 02:21:01,963
Where did you go?

1002
02:21:05,299 --> 02:21:06,884
Where 'you been?

1003
02:21:12,934 --> 02:21:14,685
Someone's there.

1004
02:21:17,939 --> 02:21:19,274
Look.

1005
02:21:43,676 --> 02:21:46,178
Hey, watch this move!

1006
02:24:57,974 --> 02:25:00,685
You' dyin lady.

1007
02:25:30,593 --> 02:25:33,847
what you say
about Pomona?

1008
02:25:34,889 --> 02:25:38,102
what you say
about Pomona?

1009
02:25:39,353 --> 02:25:43,232
You asked about the bus.

1010
02:25:43,733 --> 02:25:47,404
Can't get no bus to Pamona.

1011
02:25:49,156 --> 02:25:52,075
You can get the bus for Pamona here.

1012
02:25:53,035 --> 02:25:56,371
If you get on the subway first.

1013
02:25:58,750 --> 02:26:02,086
I never can get no bus.

1014
02:26:06,257 --> 02:26:10,137
You can go all around Hollywood.

1015
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:14,933
I was in Hollywood Irvine,

1016
02:26:15,142 --> 02:26:19,522
And you can get to Pomona
for 3,50.

1017
02:26:19,557 --> 02:26:23,903
From Hollywood, Irvine to Pamona

1018
02:26:25,862 --> 02:26:29,116
I never heard
of no bus there.

1019
02:26:30,993 --> 02:26:34,171
I ride on the bus
to Pomona...

1020
02:26:34,206 --> 02:26:38,022
.. last summer
to visit my friend...

1021
02:26:38,057 --> 02:26:41,838
.. who lives there.
Her name is Nico.

1022
02:26:41,873 --> 02:26:46,719
I stayed with her
two weeks.

1023
02:26:48,596 --> 02:26:51,641
My cousin comes from Pomona.

1024
02:26:53,393 --> 02:26:57,898
She has a place there, and said
I can stay there.

1025
02:27:00,693 --> 02:27:03,321
What time is it

1026
02:27:05,406 --> 02:27:07,576
I don' know.

1027
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:11,455
It's after midnight.

1028
02:27:12,289 --> 02:27:14,040
After midnight?

1029
02:27:15,291 --> 02:27:19,845
My friend Nico, who lives
in Pomona...

1030
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:25,846
...has a blonde wig.
she wears it at Paris.

1031
02:27:26,263 --> 02:27:32,103
but she's on hard drugs and turning tricks now.

1032
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:38,359
She looks very good
in her blonde wig...

1033
02:27:39,402 --> 02:27:41,279
just like a movie star.

1034
02:27:41,362 --> 02:27:44,616
Even girls fall in love with her.

1035
02:27:44,825 --> 02:27:49,204
When she's looking so good...

1036
02:27:50,039 --> 02:27:54,294
In her blonde star wig

1037
02:27:54,627 --> 02:27:59,090
She blows kisses and loves

1038
02:27:59,215 --> 02:28:05,557
But she has got a hole in her vagina wall

1039
02:28:07,434 --> 02:28:12,564
She has torn a hole

1040
02:28:13,481 --> 02:28:15,692
...into her intestine

1041
02:28:15,776 --> 02:28:18,195
...from her vagina.

1042
02:28:18,278 --> 02:28:19,113
Shit baby...

1043
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:23,075
you didn't tell us that shit...

1044
02:28:24,661 --> 02:28:27,163
She has a shitty doctor,

1045
02:28:27,246 --> 02:28:30,167
But it is too expensive.

1046
02:28:32,462 --> 02:28:37,467
And now she knows her time has
run out.

1047
02:28:39,969 --> 02:28:43,098
She scored a few more times,

1048
02:28:44,265 --> 02:28:48,068
And then, like that,

1049
02:28:48,103 --> 02:28:52,275
...she will stay at home, with her monkey.

1050
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:55,404
It has a pet monkey.

1051
02:28:55,445 --> 02:29:00,742
This monkey shits everywhere,
But she doesn't care

1052
02:29:01,243 --> 02:29:03,245
This monkey can scream.

1053
02:29:03,328 --> 02:29:07,833
It screams like it in a horror movie.

1054
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:19,513
But there are those who are
good with animals.

1055
02:29:21,181 --> 02:29:25,520
Who have a way with animals.

1056
02:30:27,797 --> 02:30:30,592
It's ok..
You dying is all

1057
02:31:02,544 --> 02:31:05,839
I'll show you the light now...

1058
02:31:10,262 --> 02:31:13,764
It burns bright, for heaven.

1059
02:31:18,602 --> 02:31:22,107
No more blue tomorrows.

1060
02:31:29,449 --> 02:31:32,661
You goin high now love.

1061
02:33:00,048 --> 02:33:01,174
And...

1062
02:33:03,094 --> 02:33:04,929
And.. Print it!

1063
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:10,893
It was fantastic.

1064
02:33:11,102 --> 02:33:15,692
Check the gate.
check the gate please!

1065
02:33:35,421 --> 02:33:38,550
Lets go right now
for Nikki Grace.

1066
02:33:39,051 --> 02:33:40,635
Nikki Grace, everybody.

1067
02:33:40,719 --> 02:33:41,970
Bravo!

1068
02:34:33,819 --> 02:34:35,570
What's a matter with Nikki.

1069
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:03,936
Nikki.

1070
02:35:05,187 --> 02:35:06,022
Nikki.

1071
02:35:14,698 --> 02:35:16,033
Nikki.

1072
02:35:16,450 --> 02:35:18,952
You were wonderful.

1073
02:37:12,286 --> 02:37:15,956
I guess after my son died,

1074
02:37:16,290 --> 02:37:20,628
, I went into a bad time.

1075
02:37:21,796 --> 02:37:27,343
When I was watching everything go around me
while I was standing in the middle.

1076
02:37:27,427 --> 02:37:32,309
Watching it, like in a dark theater.

1077
02:37:34,019 --> 02:37:38,065
before they bring the lights up.

1078
02:37:48,993 --> 02:37:49,826
Hello?

1079
02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:51,288
Yeah

1080
02:37:52,456 --> 02:37:54,415
She's still here

1081
02:37:56,085 --> 02:37:57,252
Yeah...

1082
02:37:59,338 --> 02:38:01,006
He's around here someplace.

1083
02:38:01,131 --> 02:38:02,759
That is right.

1084
02:49:30,310 --> 02:49:32,689
Heather?

1085
02:49:35,733 --> 02:49:37,402
Paul?

1086
02:53:27,532 --> 02:53:30,326
Sweet...
