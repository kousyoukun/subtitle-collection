Becky?

41
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,812
Hello, Otis.

42
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,652
Well, how are you?

43
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:28,903
Good.

44
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:29,820
It's good to see you.

45
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,656
Good to see you, too.

46
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,574
You got all your things?

47
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,867
Yeah.

48
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:40,164
You look terrible.

49
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,671
Okay, come on.
Let's go.

50
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,547
It's this way.

51
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,853
Before you got
married I told you

52
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,689
Leroy was no damn good.

53
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,524
That he was trash
and he'd always be trash

54
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,401
and you was going to catch it
and you did, didn't you?

55
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,027
I don't really want to
talk about him right now.

56
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,113
Okay by me, we don't
have to talk about it now.

57
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,906
We don't have to
talk about it ever.

58
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,075
How long are you
going to be up here?

59
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,201
It's hard to say.

60
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:18,160
What about Lurleen?

61
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,662
How long can you
leave her with Mama?

62
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:20,955
I don't know.

63
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,165
I'm going to get a job,
make some money.

64
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,459
Maybe bring her up here,
I don't know.

65
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,669
Where did you tell Leroy
you were going?

66
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,045
I don't want
to talk about him.

67
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,923
Okay, we don't have
to talk about him!

68
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,969
You hungry?

69
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,053
Yeah.

70
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,930
Good, I'm hungry, too.

71
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,225
You think Leroy's hungry?

72
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,647
Do you want some more coffee?

73
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:47,815
Yeah, thanks.

74
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,275
Here.

75
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,121
So what kind of work do you
planning on getting up here?

76
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,331
Anything like...

77
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,041
I haven't decided yet.

78
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,168
What else can you do
besides dance naked?

79
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,711
Don't start with me, Otis.

80
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,755
I can do lots of things,
mister.

81
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:11,922
Oh yeah? Like what?

82
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,382
Like waitressing

83
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,592
or a beautician.

84
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,760
Yeah.

85
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,804
After seeing you I might
just try brain surgery.

86
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:22,808
You're a card.

87
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,143
Yeah, I'm the queen.

88
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,187
Yeah, the queen of clubs.

89
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,486
Don't make me sorry
I came here, Otis.

90
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,204
Howdy.

91
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,497
Hey, Henry.

92
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,207
I brought you a present.

93
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,460
Where did you get that?

94
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,961
Picked it up.

95
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,049
Whew!

96
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:55,925
Pretty nice, huh?

97
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,010
Sure is a beauty.

98
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,856
Oh, uh...

99
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,526
Henry, this here
is my sister, Becky.

100
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,653
She's gonna be staying here
with us for a while,

101
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,862
like I said.

102
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,948
Becky, this here's Henry.

103
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,533
Hello, Henry.

104
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:21,450
Hello, Becky.

105
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,452
Good to meet you.

106
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:25,788
She don't look
nothing like you,

107
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:26,831
that's for sure.

108
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,457
Lucky for her.

109
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,793
Henry's on his way out west.

110
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:31,710
Oh, where?

111
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:32,920
California.

112
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,797
Oh.

113
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,424
She can sleep
on the couch.

114
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,092
No, no.

115
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,678
Listen, Becky, I want you
to take the spare room.

116
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,263
No, Henry,
thank you but no...

117
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,889
I insist.

118
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:45,391
Ain't that right, Otis?

119
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,684
Up to you.

120
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:48,978
Alright,

121
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,272
but if it gets to be
a bother, we'll change.

122
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,606
Fair enough.

123
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,607
Well, I got to get going.

124
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,192
I got some work to do today.

125
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,902
<i>I just stopped by
to clean up a little.</i>

126
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:57,862
Where you working?

127
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,115
<i>I'm helping Andy spray
some houses off La Grange.</i>

128
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,200
Oh, so that's working
out for you, huh?

129
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,493
<i>Yeah.</i>

130
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,162
Sounds like fun.

131
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:07,872
Coffee?

132
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,541
No thanks, I gotta go.

133
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,837
See ya.

134
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,505
Yeah.

135
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:41,989
<i>That's it till next week.</i>

136
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,033

a little more work.</i>

137
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,910
<i>So was I.</i>

138
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,331
You never know.

139
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,790
Sometimes I get a call.

140
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,000
You know,

141
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:57,379
these assholes want you to
be out there the next day.

142
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,297
You never know.

143
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,632
Yeah.

144
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,593
Here, take this.

145
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,470
We'll call it a retainer.

146
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,346
Thanks.

147
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,931
You don't here from me

148
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,807
give me a call.

149
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,727
Hold on.
Don't forget your sprayer.

150
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,437
Hang onto it.

151
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,774
Okay.

152
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,946
Come on, kid,
come on.

153
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,656
Throw it in there.

154
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,782
Good catch.

155
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,868
Put a spiral on it.

156
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,079
Nice catch.

157
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,416
Sorry about that.

00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,985
It's good.

161
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,701
And please check
the left rear tire.

162
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,713
It's good, too.

163
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,674
Thank you.

164
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,133
Yeah.

165
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,435
And what can
I do for you, sir?

166
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,813
You got any more of
what you had last week?

167
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,064
I might.

168
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,024
Well, do you
or don't you?

169
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,609
Yeah.

170
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:06,652
Well?

171
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,196
Well, I don't have
it on me, stupid.

172
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,657
Give me the money.

173
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:17,871
I'll bring it
around the field.

174
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,415
I don't want you
hanging around practice.

175
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,916
Give me my money back.

176
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,209
Up to you.

177
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,755
Be in the parking lot
at 6:30.

178
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:29,842
Sure thing.

179
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,427
6:30 tomorrow.

180
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,344
Tomorrow?

181
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,096
Take it or leave it.

182
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,055
Great.

183
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,557
See ya.

184
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,479
Fuckin' pervert.

185
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,159
Ugh, this is so gross.

186
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,619
I always did hate doing this.

187
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:58,662
I'll do it.

188
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,372
That's alright.

189
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,129
Where did you say
you met him?

190
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,547
Who?

191
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,341
You know who. Henry.

192
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,011
What do you want
to know for?

193
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,262
I don't know.

194
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,139
I'm just curious.

195
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,392
Vandalia.

196
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,519
Vandalia?

197
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,730
Sure, Vandalia.

198
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,148
Oh.

199
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,108
What was he in for?

200
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,110
You don't want to know.

201
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,029
What did he do,
kill his mama?

202
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,155
Uh-huh.

203
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,282
Come on,
what was he in for?

204
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,241
You don't want to know.

205
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,869
What did he do,
rob a bank or something?

206
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,497
You were right the first time.

207
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,500
- Huh?
- You were right
the first time.

208
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,085
He killed his mama.

209
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,379
Don't you ever
tell him I told you.

210
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,422
You're kidding me?

211
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,216
- No, I ain't.
- Yes, you are.

212
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,759
Alright, I'm kidding you.

213
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,136
Just don't ever
tell him I told you.

214
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,013
He killed his mama?

215
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,556
With a baseball bat.

216
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,934
Her and one of her
boyfriends.

217
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,519
I swear, if you ever
tell him I told you

218
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,145
I'll beat your ass right off.

219
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,396
How do you know all this?

220
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,106
He told me,
that's how I know.

221
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,233
How else would I know?

222
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,400
Were you cellmates
or something?

223
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,320
No, we were friends.

224
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,613
When did he get out?

225
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,615
A couple of years before me.

226
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,416
Hi.

227
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,293
<i>♪ I got my fingers on it</i>

228
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,455
I got some business
I got to take care of.

229
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:06,248
You going out?

230
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,624
Yeah, for a while,

231
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,710
I got to run
an errand for a fellow.

232
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,295
You want to
come along, Henry?

233
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,506
Uh... no.
No, you go ahead.

234
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,008
Okay.

235
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,885
See you later.

236
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,396
Want to play cards?

237
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:31,940
Mm-hmm.

238
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,914
What was your daddy like?

239
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,582
My daddy?

240
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,626
He used to drive a truck

241
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,045
before he got
his legs cut off.

242
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,924
I remember one time,

243
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:00,260
he brought me and my
little brother home bicycles.

244
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,678
He had delivered
some that day

245
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,222
and he had
a couple left over.

246
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,184
But, mine was
way too big for me,

247
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,854
and my brother,
he couldn't ride his anyway.

248
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,689
Daddy, he said
I'd grow into it,

249
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,983
but I never did.

250
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,944
Why not?

251
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,445
I never got the chance.

252
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,155
They sold it.

253
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,782
They sold them both.

254
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,244
So you have a brother?

255
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,749
My brother,
he had a bone disorder.

256
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:34,086
He was a little deformed.

257
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,837
What happened to him?

258
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,715
He died.

259
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:47,307
I can't ever remember
really liking my daddy.

260
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,018
I wanted to,
I really did.

261
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:56,024
One time he bought me,
when I was about five,

262
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,276
he bought me
an ice cream cone

263
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,278
and I dropped it.

264
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,030
And he slapped me

265
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,366
and made me
pick it up and eat it.

266
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,744
I never liked my daddy.

267
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,999
One time,

268
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,126
when my momma was at work,

269
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,378
and I was about 13,

270
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,462
he come into my room

271
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:21,049
and he told me
to take my shirt off

272
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,428
'cause he wanted to see
how I was developed.

273
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,595
And when I wouldn't

274
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,598
he got real mad
and he hit me.

275
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,350
And he told me he had a right

276
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,978
because he was my daddy
and I was his daughter

277
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,523
and he fed me
and let me live in his house

278
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,151
and he could do
whatever he wanted.

279
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,778
And he did.

280
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,534
Then he started coming into
my room a lot after that.

281
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,369
And I didn't fight him

282
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,663
because when I did
he just hit me.

283
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,917
I was afraid I was
going to have a baby

284
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,879
and that my baby
would be deformed,

285
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,465
but I never got pregnant.

286
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,553
I tried to tell Mama,

287
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,097
but she didn't
want to hear about it.

288
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,892
She pretended
not to believe me,

289
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,269
but I knew she did.

290
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,566
It sure is good to talk...

291
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,235
to talk to you, Henry,

292
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,571
because I know
you're not judgmental

293
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,907
or anything like that.

294
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,703
I never would have married
Leroy in the first place

295
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,748
if I hadn't wanted to get
away from Daddy so bad.

296
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,667
Didn't get along
with your daddy, huh?

297
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,927
Did you really
kill your mama?

298
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,261
What?

299
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,599
Did you really
kill your mama?

300
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,810
I guess I did.

301
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,230
How did it happen?

302
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,359
I stabbed her.

303
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,238
Otis said you hit her
with a baseball bat.

304
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,240
Otis said that?

305
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,658
Yeah.

306
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,993
Well, he's mistaken.

307
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,872
Well, don't tell him
I told you,

308
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,208
he made me promise.

309
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,254
She must have
treated you real bad.

310
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,678
She was a whore.

311
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,306
My mama was a whore.

312
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,435
But I don't
fault her for that.

313
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,689
It ain't what she done,
it's how she done it.

314
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,235
As long as I can remember

315
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:48,530
she'd be bringing men
up to the house.

316
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,031
My daddy was there too,

317
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,784
but it didn't matter
none to her.

318
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,539
She'd make me watch it.

319
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,625
That's creepy.

320
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,670
She beat me, too.
A lot.

321
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,175
She'd beat me when
I wouldn't watch it.

322
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,052
And sometimes she'd beat me,

323
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,680
make me wear a dress

324
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:16,683
and watch her doing it.

325
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,019
Then they'd laugh at me.

326
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,396
She made you wear a dress?

327
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,607
You think I'm lying?

328
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,155
I feel like I know you.

329
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:33,617
Like, I've known you
for a long time.

330
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,411
I feel like I've known you
for ever and ever.

331
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,048
Yeah...

332
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,550
I killed my mama.

333
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,470
One night,

334
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,973
It was my 14th birthday

335
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:01,811
and she was drunk
and we had an argument.

336
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,398
She hit me
with a whiskey bottle.

337
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,694
And I shot her.

338
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,821
I shot her dead.

339
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,450
I thought you said
you stabbed her?

340
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,707
Oh yeah.

341
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,211
That's right.

342
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,798
I stabbed her.

343
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,308
Hey.

344
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,608
Anything good on TV?

345
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,504
<i>I got a job today.</i>

346
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,839
<i>Oh yeah?
Doing what?</i>

347
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,549
<i>At a beauty parlor.</i>

348
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:55,425
<i>A beauty parlor?</i>

349
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,093
<i>I'm a shampoo girl.</i>

350
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,303
<i>What's that?</i>

351
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,846
<i>What's it sound like,
you dummy?</i>

352
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:00,764
<i>How the hell should I know?</i>

353
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,724
<i>You ever seen me
in a beauty parlor?</i>

354
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,184
<i>I give shampoos,</i>

355
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,518
<i>a woman gets her
hair shampooed</i>

356
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,730
<i>before she gets it cut
and I do it.</i>

357
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,523
<i>They pay you for that?</i>

358
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,983
<i>Of course they do.</i>

359
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,151
<i>Besides, I used to
do it some back home</i>

360
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,903
<i>after I met Leroy.</i>

361
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,405
Do you like it better
than dancing naked?

362
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,907
Don't start with me, Otis.

363
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:21,618
You used to dance naked?

364
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,411
Sure, all the time
around the house.

365
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:24,621
Otis.

366
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,247
Best little naked dancer
you ever saw.

367
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,624
You never.

368
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,836
Were you really a dancer?

369
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,714
I danced some,
in a club,

370
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,925
and I wasn't naked.

371
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,552
I wore a costume.

372
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,596
But I guess it
wasn't very much.

373
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,931
Oh.

374
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,141
When you gonna dance for us?

375
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,936
When the Pope
pees in his hat, Otis.

376
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,730
Ain't she got
a mouth on her?

377
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:51,815
I better have
something on me

378
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,817
to defend me
from a pig like you.

379
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,236
Otis.

380
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,324
Them pretty earrings
you got on, Becky.

381
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,159
Thank you, Henry.

382
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,579
At least there's one
gentleman at this table.

383
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,207
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Now don't get mad.

384
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,710
I was just having a little
fun with you, that's all.

385
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,421
Oh, wait,
I got something to show you.

386
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,172
- What?
- Wait.

387
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,094
Ta-da!

388
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,346
Nice.

389
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,764
Real nice.

390
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,015
Put it on.

391
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:26,933
Right now?

392
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,518
Uh-huh.

393
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,729
Okay,
but turn around first.

394
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,481
Turn around.

395
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,048
Okay, you can look.

396
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,760
What does it say on there?

397
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,554
I love Chicago.

398
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,515
Looks good,
don't it, Otis?

399
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,184
Uh-huh.

400
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,063
Oh hey, honey,

401
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,900
why don't you bring me a beer,
this one's empty.

402
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,402
I ain't your maid.
Get it yourself.

403
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,530
Aw, now come on, honey,
I ain't askin' you

404
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,574
to wash the windows
or nothing,

405
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,575
I just want a beer.

406
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:28,995
Come on, bring your poor
old brother a beer, will ya?

407
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,420
Don't do that, Otis,
she's your sister!

408
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,214
Okay, I was only
kidding around, Henry.

409
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,632
Tell her you're sorry.

410
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,717
Okay, I'm sorry.

411
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,802
Now, tell her you
won't do it again.

412
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:45,970
I won't,

413
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,431
I swear, Becky.
I swear, I won't.

414
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,225
Ow!

415
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:52,143
Shit, Henry!

416
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,814
Serves you right.

417
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:57,899
Thank you, Henry.

418
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,692
That's alright.

419
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,028
Listen, I'll do the dishes.

420
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,530
I don't mind.

421
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,240
I don't.

422
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:21,172
Listen, why don't you boys
go out and get a beer.

423
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,717
I'll do these.
I don't mind, honest.

424
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:35,103
Well, what do you say, Otis?

425
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:40,108
You want to go grab a beer?

426
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,535
Sure, I don't mind.

427
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,918
I'll just go spruce up.

428
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:07,635
That was a real
nice supper, Becky.

429
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,512
Thanks.

430
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,182
Have fun.

431
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,978

Susie!

453
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:02,417
Susie--Ah!

454
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:38,870
Otis!

455
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,081
Come here,
I'll drive.

456
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,186
Fuck.

457
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,104
What's gonna happen
when they find those bodies?

458
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,148
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?

459
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,317
Just what I said, Otis.
Nothing.

460
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,778
Nothing's gonna happen
cause nothing happened.

461
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,822
And I don't know nothing
about it, whatever it is.

462
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,492
Do you?

463
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,077
Hey, I don't know nothin'!

464
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,330
Good.

465
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,040
Oh, fuck.

466
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,681
Feelin' better?

467
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,476
Yeah.

468
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,403
You want some fries?

469
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:30,022
You telling me you never
killed anybody before?

470
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:32,149
I ain't saying that.

471
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,527
Then you've killed before,
right?

472
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,405
Well, maybe I didn't
have no choice.

473
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:40,867
You didn't have no
choice here neither.

474
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,702
Did you?

475
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,164
- Huh?
- Did you?

476
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,501
I don't know,

477
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,087
it ain't the same.

478
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,673
It's always the same

479
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,342
and it's always different.

480
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,678
What do you mean?

481
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:03,806
It's either you or them,
one way or the other.

482
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,893
Ain't that right?

483
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:09,812
I don't know.

484
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,106
Open your eyes, Otis.

485
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,233
Look at the world.

486
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:17,236
It's either you or them.

487
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,656
You know what I mean.

488
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,329
Yeah.

489
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,666
Good.

490
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,961
You want a beer?

491
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,212
Okay.

492
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:36,881
Okay.

493
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,405
There was only one left.

494
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:12,667
...He knows
nothing about this

495
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,085
but you can bet
a dollar to a doughnut

496
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,628
that when he finds out,

497
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,672
and he will find out
'cause I'll tell him,

498
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:18,965
there'll be hell to pay.

499
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:19,799
Really?

500
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,883
I'll never go
back there again,

501
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,301
I can tell you that.

502
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:24,595
Not when he's not there,
anyway.

503
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,723
First of all, there ain't two
of them that speaks English.

504
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,351
It's gone down so badly
with the way it's changed,

505
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,019
it breaks my heart.

506
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,938
It's like that all over.

507
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,731
People spit at you.

508
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,566
I wish I was lying.

509
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,944
Yeah, you can't have a regular
good time in the city no more...

510
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:43,572
<i>...Delicate sensibilities.</i>

511
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:45,950
<i>Now if you really love me,</i>

512
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:49,870
<i>you should find me
a beautiful well bred girl,</i>

513
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:51,789
<i>to give me a little polish.</i>

514
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:58,295
<i>Favor for favor.
Do you remember?</i>

515
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,602
Ah, shit!

516
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,151
Fuck.

517
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:24,572
What did you do that for?

518
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,243
I guess I got carried away.

519
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,872
Well, I guess you did, Otis.

520
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:36,167
Shit, I got to have a TV.

521
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:42,256
Well, let's go shopping.

522
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:32,098
So what can I
do for you gentlemen?

523
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:33,557
Oh, It's hot in here,
isn't it?

524
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,226
I've got a cold.

525
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,019
We want a TV.

526
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,939
How much you got to spend?

527
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:41,232
What do you got?

528
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:43,567
Fifty bucks.

529
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,570
I can let you have the set
over there for 50 bucks.

530
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,531
Well, turn it on.
We want to see if it works.

531
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:51,117
- What's the matter,
don't you trust me?
- Uh-uh.

532
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,496
Here, plug it in down there.

533
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:57,623
Here?

534
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,125
Yeah, down there,
real good.

535
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,043
I see you've had some college.

536
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,755
Like you can see,
it works real good.

537
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,423
Just takes a while
to warm up.

538
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,800
It's black and white!

539
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,510
Of course it's
black and white.

540
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,053
What do you expect
for fifty bucks?

541
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:12,721
Fuckin' 3-D, for Christ's sake?

542
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:14,431
Well, how much is color?

543
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:15,933
We want color.

544
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,102
You can't get color
for 50 dollars.

545
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,646
That's okay,
let's see what you got.

546
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,273
What have I got?

547
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,482
You want cable ready?

548
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,775
You want remote control?

549
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,360
You want UHF?

550
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:29,196
You want 13 inch?
You want 19 inch?

551
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,906
I bet you'd
like to have a 19 inch.

552
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,241
Oh yeah.

553
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,242
You want Sony?

554
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,076
You want Zenith?

555
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,078
Do you want a Gold Star?

556
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,247
What can we get for a $150?

557
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,541
I could let you have
this set for $150.

558
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,042
It's worth $300.

559
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,294
But here,
take a look at this.

560
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,963
For an extra $75,

561
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,757
you can take this $600 set.

562
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,594
What's this?

563
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:52,887
It's a camcorder.

564
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,679
What?

565
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:56,724
It's a videotape recorder
and camera rolled into one.

566
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,976
You just pop in a cassette
and you're ready to go.

567
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,519
You can make your
own movies with that?

568
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,354
What else would
you do with it?

569
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,898
How much you want for it?

570
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:06,400
It's worth a grand,
I'd take half.

571
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,484
Five hundred bucks?

572
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,070
Yeah,
half of a grand is $500.

573
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:12,781
That's a little more than
we were planning to spend.

574
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:14,992
I think we should
just take the TV.

575
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,453
Okay,
which one do you want?

576
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:20,706
The $50 one.

577
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:22,458
The $50 one.

578
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,500
You guys come in here,

579
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,003
I show this,
I show you that,

580
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,547
and you creeps got
a lousy $50 to spend.

581
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,507
You should have
stopped me a long time ago.

582
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:31,884
Take the $50 set

583
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,844
and get the hell out,
I'm a busy man.

584
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:37,056
Well, we were really
counting on a color set.

585
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,350
What's the matter,
you got shit in your ears?

586
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:42,311
The black and white is $50,
take it or leave it!

587
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:43,854
Sorry we wasted your time.

588
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:44,647
Come on, Otis.

589
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,942
Don't give me sorry,
you dumb ass!

590
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,068
Did I stutter?

591
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,986
Gimme the $50 and get out!

592
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,655
I'll give you $50!

593
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,541
God damnit!

594
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,211
Help! Help!

595
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,004
No!

596
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,727
Otis,

597
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,354
plug it in.

598
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,029
<i>♪ Oh baby</i>

599
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,324
<i>♪ You're driving me crazy</i>

600
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,203
<i>♪ I said baby...</i>

601
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,457
Oh, get out of here.
You're too ugly anyways.

602
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:46,917
Wait.

603
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,128
Lurleen, here's
your Uncle Otis.

604
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,547
Hi, Lurl--
Hi, Lurleen. Hi, honey,

605
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,008
Hi, it's Uncle Otis.

606
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:56,176
Get out of here.
Henry, come dance with me.

607
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,261
Come on,
come on, just dance.

608
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:58,387
- Go ahead. Dance
<i>- Who? Me?</i>

609
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,722
- Yeah!
- No, no, no.

610
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:01,682
Come on, Henry.

611
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:02,725
Come on.

612
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,476
Come on, do it, Henry.

613
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,103
Go ahead, do it.

614
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,354
That's it.

615
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:09,106
Go like this.

616
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,524
Get down.

617
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,693
"Boogie" as they say here.

618
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,153
Okay.

619
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:25,873
<i>More, more.</i>

620
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:28,167
<i>Come on, go for it.</i>

621
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,085
<i>- Come on Henry, that's it.</i>
- That's it.

622
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:31,920
<i>The hands.
Work them hands, Henry.</i>

623
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:33,839
<i>That's it, that's it.</i>

624
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:36,675
<i>Whoa!
Low and behold, what a guy.</i>

625
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:39,762
<i>Come on, come on.
See, look how good it is.</i>

626
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:42,431
<i>Right there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

627
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,766
<i>Oh, come on.
Come on.</i>

628
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,851
<i>- More, more!</i>
- No, I don't want to.

629
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,519
<i>- More!</i>
- No, I'm okay.

630
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:50,189
<i>- More damnit!</i>
- Go to bed, Otis.

631
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:53,525
- Come on, get your face in there.
- Get!

632
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,778
Turn it off!

633
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,654
Oh, come on.
Come on.

634
00:44:58,072 --> 00:45:00,199
<i>Ooh...</i>

635
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,662
Turn it off!

636
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:08,082
<i>- I want more,
just a little bit more.</i>
- All right.

637
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:09,500
<i>Come on. A little--
That's it, that's it.</i>

638
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,126
<i>This is for Lurleen.
Come on.</i>

639
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,837
<i>- All right, that's it.</i>
- Hi, Lurleen.

640
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,506
<i>Come on, Henry.
Say hi.</i>

641
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,049
- No.
<i>- Say hi, Henry.</i>

642
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,093
- No more, Otis.
<i>- Say hi, Henry.</i>

643
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,637
- No more, Otis!
- He doesn't want to.

644
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,472
<i>- Say hi, Becky.</i>
- I said hi.

645
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,891
<i>Come on. Come on.
Come on. More.</i>

646
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,523
Yeah?

647
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:36,068
Uh-huh.

648
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,987
Look, I'll do the best I can,
but I don't promise--

649
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:40,656
Fuck him.

650
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:42,908
Yeah, yeah, good-bye.

651
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,243
Crazy guy.

652
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,369
What?

653
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:48,163
Some jerk off hasn't
been out of jail six months,

654
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:49,957
gets drunk,
gets busted up in a fight.

655
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,291
So he goes home
and gets a gun,

656
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:53,293
comes back later
and shoots the guy.

657
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:56,046
They find the gun on him.
He claims he was framed.

658
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,714
What are you going to do?

659
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:00,384
So, everything going okay?

660
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,343
Yeah.

661
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:04,721
Okay. You still working
at Bob's Gas?

662
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:05,597
Yes, sir.

663
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,933
Good.
You working everyday?

664
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:09,601
Two, three days a week.

665
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:10,686
It's a little slow now.

666
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,688
Well, if it's less than
two days a week, let me know.

667
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:14,189
We'll see what
we can do for you.

668
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:16,150
You still living
at 1801 West North?

669
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,484
Yes, sir.

670
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:18,235
Alright, good.

671
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:19,987
I got to cut it
short today, Otis.

672
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,530
My kid's scheduled
for oral surgery.

673
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:22,656
I promised to take him over.

674
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:23,907
Sure.

675
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:25,576
Good.
I'll see you next month?

676
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:27,661
Take it easy.

677
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:29,997
Bye.

678
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:51,602
You got it?

679
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:53,187
Got what?

680
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,772
You know what.

681
00:46:58,025 --> 00:46:59,526
Here you go.

682
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:02,362
You wanna try it?

683
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,414
Oh!

684
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,918
God damn you,
you son of a bitch!

685
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,753
Fuckin'...!

686
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:21,632
Damn it!

687
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,011
Mother fucker.

688
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,430
Let me see that.

689
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,059
That little fuckin' bastard.
I ought to kill him.

690
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:33,810
I ought to cut his
fuckin' head off.

691
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:35,562
That'd be a mistake.

692
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:37,314
Look who's talking.

693
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:40,150
Watch your mouth, Otis.

694
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,487
I'm sorry, Henry.

695
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,905
You kill that high school boy,

696
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,658
they're going to slap your ass
right back in jail, Otis.

697
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:49,243
That's a promise.

698
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:52,079
I mean, people have
seen you together.

699
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,039
I'd still like
to kill him, though.

700
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:55,624
I bet you would.

701
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,126
I'd like to kill somebody.

702
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,962
Say that again.

703
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,756
I'd like to kill somebody.

704
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:05,300
Let's me and you
go for a ride, Otis.

705
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,976
Here, I want to
show you something.

706
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,104
Where'd you get this?

707
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:43,565
Careful, Otis,
it's loaded.

708
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:45,400
Where'd you get it?

709
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:47,319
Guns are easy to get.

710
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,613
I can make a phone call
and get a gun.

711
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,490
Anybody can get a gun, Otis.

712
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,367
What do you got
in mind, Henry?

713
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,202
What do you think?

714
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,247
I don't know.

715
00:50:00,624 --> 00:50:02,376
Put up the hood.

716
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:03,335
Why?

717
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,629
Just put up the hood, Otis.

718
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,842
You guys need any help?

719
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,428
Otis, do you need some help,

720
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:56,638
or can you do it yourself?

721
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,778
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

722
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,406
Alright.

723
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,296
<i>If you shoot somebody
in the head with a.45</i>

724
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:31,590
<i>every time you kill somebody</i>

725
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:34,134
<i>it becomes like
your fingerprint, see?</i>

726
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,261
<i>But if you strangle one
and stab another,</i>

727
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:39,222
<i>one you cut up,
one you don't,</i>

728
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:41,349
<i>then the police
don't know what to do.</i>

729
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,977
<i>They think you're
four different people.</i>

730
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,021
<i>What they really like,</i>

731
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,106
<i>what makes their job
so much easier,</i>

732
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,816
<i>is a pattern.</i>

733
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,277
What they call
a modus operandi.

734
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:54,905
That's Latin.

735
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:56,907
Bet you didn't know
any Latin, did ya?

736
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,700
Big fuckin' deal.

737
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:00,827
What?

738
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,621
Nothing.

739
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,541
<i>It's like a trail
of shit, Otis.</i>

740
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,753
<i>It's like a blood droppings
from a deer you've shot</i>

741
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:12,130
<i>and all they gotta do
is follow those droppings</i>

742
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:15,634
<i>and pretty soon they're
going to find their deer.</i>

743
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:28,355
Why do we use a gun?

744
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,025
You could use a gun.

745
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,693
I'm not saying
you can't use a gun.

746
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:36,613
Just don't use
the same gun twice.

747
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:42,244
<i>The most important thing
is to keep moving.</i>

748
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:45,914
<i>That way they might
never catch up to you.</i>

749
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,040
I'm gonna have to pack up

750
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:49,125
and be on the move too,
pretty soon.

751
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:50,919
Where are you going?

752
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,462
Nowhere.

753
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:54,798
You wanna come?

754
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,133
We could be back this way
in about a month.

755
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,011
I'm not supposed
to leave the state

756
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:01,012
without telling them.

757
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:01,972
So who's gonna know?

758
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:05,225
As long as you show up
when you're supposed to?

759
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:08,103
What if they check up
on me at work?

760
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:11,481
Well, no plan is perfect.

761
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:09,915
<i>- Bring her in.
- No!</i>

762
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:11,416
<i>Bring her in, Otis.</i>

763
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:12,834
<i>- No!
- Come on.</i>

764
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:14,544
<i>That's it.
Yeah, yeah.</i>

765
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:17,047
<i>Sit down.
Sit her down.</i>

766
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,298
<i>Oh, good, good,
good, good, good.</i>

767
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,674
<i>Get her blouse off.</i>

768
00:54:19,758 --> 00:54:21,426
<i>Take it off.
Take it off.</i>

769
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:24,179
<i>- Oh yeah, Otis. Good.
- No! No!</i>

770
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:26,181
<i>- Nice, nice. Yeah, yeah.
- No! No!</i>

771
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,849
<i>Skirt, skirt, skirt.</i>

772
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,684
<i>Do it, Otis!
You're a star!</i>

773
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:31,728
<i>Oh!</i>

774
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:39,653
<i>Shut up!</i>

775
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:41,446
<i>Shut up!</i>

776
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,492
<i>I'll do what the hell
I want to do, bitch!</i>

777
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:48,161
<i>- Huh? Huh?
- Leave me alone!</i>

778
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,663
<i>- Leave me alone!
- Do it, Otis.</i>

779
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:51,706
<i>Do it.</i>

780
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,416
<i>Henry, look.
Henry, look.</i>

781
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,085
<i>You got it.</i>

782
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:57,420
<i>- Go for it, boy.
- No! No!</i>

783
00:54:57,837 --> 00:55:00,548
<i>- No! No!
- Wave! Wave!</i>

784
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:03,009
<i>- Shut up!
- No! No! No!</i>

785
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:05,303
<i>Get the goddamn kid!</i>

786
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,997
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

787
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,623
<i>Henry, look!</i>

788
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,485
<i>Hey, Henry?</i>

789
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:03,862
<i>Henry?</i>

790
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:07,115
<i>What?</i>

791
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,909
<i>- Hi! Bye!
- Looky here, where you at.</i>

792
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,494
<i>Say hello, honey!</i>

793
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:12,746
<i>Say bye.</i>

794
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:14,205
<i>I have to wave to my buddy.</i>

795
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:15,373
<i>Henry, hi.</i>

796
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:17,083
<i>Henry, look at this, Henry.</i>

797
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,793
<i>Ain't it beautiful?</i>

798
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,463
<i>Otis!</i>

799
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:22,922
<i>No, Otis!</i>

800
00:56:23,006 --> 00:56:24,257
<i>Otis!</i>

801
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,092
<i>No!</i>

802
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,761
<i>Let's go!</i>

803
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:34,976
<i>I wanted to do that, Henry.</i>

804
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,028
What are you doing?

805
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:48,031
I want to see it again.

806
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,988
In jail?
Are you sure?

807
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,870
Is Lurleen there?
Does she know?

808
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,998
In the what?

809
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:40,917
In the army?

810
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,587
Go get her, will you?

811
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:52,053
Hi--
Hi.

812
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:55,098
Hi, hi.

813
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:58,059
Do you miss me?

814
00:57:58,143 --> 00:58:00,395
I miss you.

815
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:07,777
You did?
That's wonderful.

816
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:11,447
Are you being a good girl?

817
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:15,618
Uh...

818
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:17,912
I don't think so, honey.

819
00:58:17,996 --> 00:58:21,332
I know I promised,
but, uh...

820
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:24,377
a couple of things
have happened here.

821
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:30,216
I know,
he is a good soldier.

822
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:36,723
Soon.
Real soon, I promise.

823
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,896
I love you, too.

824
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:45,899
Yeah, put your
grandma back on, okay?

825
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:50,820
Hi.

826
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:56,701
I know.
I'll think about it.

827
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:01,623
I can't right now.

828
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,043
I will. Soon.

829
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,254
I can't talk anymore, okay?

830
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:09,714
I gotta go.

831
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:12,133
Okay.

832
00:59:12,217 --> 00:59:13,676
Bye.

833
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:21,476
<i>Great, great.</i>

834
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,770
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

835
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:26,898
<i>I got one,
I got one, here, look.</i>

836
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,650
<i>Oh, look, look,
look, look, look.</i>

837
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:29,943
<i>Oh, just look at this,
look at this.</i>

838
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:31,236
<i>Tight, huh.
There, huh.</i>

839
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:32,278
<i>Yeah, no, no.</i>

840
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:33,738
<i>No. Oh, no,
I like this one better.</i>

841
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,782
<i>Look, Henry.
Look, Henry. Henry, look.</i>

842
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:37,742
<i>Oh, yeah, I love it.
I love her.</i>

843
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:40,286
<i>Look it how she looks.
Isn't she pretty?</i>

844
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:41,704
<i>Oh God,
look at that dress.</i>

845
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:43,498
<i>Look at the way it moves.</i>

846
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,041
Oh yeah!

847
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:47,126
<i>Pull up next to her,
real slow.</i>

848
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,753
Oh!

849
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,547
Look what you did!

850
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:52,840
Oh God!

851
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:55,134
Oh Jesus!

852
00:59:56,886 --> 00:59:58,596
Look at it, it's ruined.

853
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,099
Damn, Henry, you ought to
look where you're drivin'.

854
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:02,600
Who the hell told you
to stick your head

855
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:03,810
out the window, anyway?

856
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:04,936
You could have killed me!

857
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,062
Oh, that's right.

858
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:07,855
Blame it on me.

859
01:00:08,523 --> 01:00:10,942
Oh, this fucking camera!

860
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:14,821
What did you do that for?

861
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:16,781
It wasn't any good anymore.

862
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,116
Could have fixed it.

863
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:20,326
Shit, the lens was
busted right off!

864
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,953
- Could have fixed it.
- How do you know,

865
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:23,997
you a camera repair man?

866
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:26,249
You should have
said something.

867
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:28,042
You didn't give me
a chance, Otis.

868
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:29,961
You threw the fucker
right out the window.

869
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,379
It ain't my fault it broke.

870
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:33,172
Oh right.

871
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,051
Go back and get it,
if you want.

872
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:38,720
Yeah.

873
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,353
Want to get a beer?

874
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:49,564
Not particularly.

875
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:50,857
I want a beer.

876
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,528
If you want
a beer so bad, Otis,

877
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,406
go ahead and get one.

878
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,366
All right, I will.

879
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:06,581
- See you later?
- Yeah.

880
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:14,547
I talked to Lurleen.

881
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,924
Yeah?

882
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,177
You'd like her.

883
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,055
God, I miss her.

884
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:24,932
I'm thinking...

885
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:27,435
I might be
heading on back home.

886
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,271
I quit.

887
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:31,564
You quit what?

888
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,318
My job.

889
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:36,694
What happened?

890
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:37,779
Nothing.

891
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,406
I just figured
it was time to go home.

892
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,286
You want to come with me?

893
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:49,248
I thought you wanted
to make some money?

894
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:52,085
Yeah, but,

895
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,294
I'm thinking,

896
01:01:53,378 --> 01:01:56,089
I don't want to bring
Lurleen up here after all.

897
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:58,049
You know,
that was my intention.

898
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:03,346
There's just too much
going on up here.

899
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,306
She'd get lost.

900
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:10,478
We're better off
living with Mama.

901
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:14,774
I can work back home.

902
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,527
I won't make as much money,
I'm sure, but

903
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,737
we won't need as much either.

904
01:02:19,821 --> 01:02:21,864
I like living with Mama.

905
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:26,244
You could stay there, too.

906
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:30,873
You figure it's
safe to go back?

907
01:02:30,957 --> 01:02:32,667
I hope so.

908
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:35,169
Leroy's in jail for murder

909
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:38,005
and his bond's
a million dollars.

910
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:40,466
So unless he wins the lottery,

911
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:43,803
Leroy won't be going anywhere
for quite a while.

912
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:46,889
Where's Otis?

913
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,227
He had a dinner date,
I think he said.

914
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,937
Really?

915
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,313
Well.

916
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:58,025
Come with me?

917
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,486
When are you leaving?

918
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,071
Tomorrow.

919
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:05,158
Hmm.

920
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,662
Better think fast, Henry.

921
01:03:12,123 --> 01:03:13,875
You got your ticket?

922
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,668
Not yet.

923
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:18,254
But my mind's made up.

924
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:20,506
Might as well just do it.

925
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,636
Might as well.

926
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:28,598
I'd rather ride with you.

927
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,352
Let me think about it.

928
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:38,649
I'll tell you what,

929
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:41,068
let's me and you
go get us a steak dinner,

930
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:42,653
I'm buying, huh?

931
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:45,781
I got a new Visa card
I want to try out.

932
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,409
- You've got a Visa card?
- Yeah.

933
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:50,828
Who you think you're
associating with, anyway?

934
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:54,123
- Great, let's go.
- Alright.

935
01:03:54,207 --> 01:03:55,583
Where are we going?

936
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,793
We'll find a place.

937
01:03:58,336 --> 01:04:01,214
Grab your jacket
and let's go.

938
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,190
<i>I gotta go to the bathroom.</i>

939
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:44,257
He's passed out.

940
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,564
I ain't interrupting nothing,
am I?

941
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,655
You guys want a beer?

942
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:53,743
You got any cigarettes?

943
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,078
Not since Superman died.

944
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:02,543
I gotta go out
and get some cigarettes,

945
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:03,961
- get some air.
- Henry?

946
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:05,296
I'll be right back,
I promise.

947
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:06,422
I just need some air.

948
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:07,798
Henry.

949
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:09,634
Do you want anything?

950
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:14,889
Otis?

951
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,891
Uh-uh.

952
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:27,610
How about getting your
poor ol' brother a beer?

953
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:19,995
Hi.

954
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,080
Two packs of Kools.

955
01:07:21,163 --> 01:07:22,248
What kind?

956
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:22,915
What?

957
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:26,001
What kind?
Milds, Regulars, 100s...

958
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:27,878
Regulars.

959
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:31,132
Two-sixty.

960
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:40,141
Hey, how about those Bears?

961
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:42,268
Fuck the Bears.

962
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,813
Okay.

963
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:00,661
Hi.

964
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,079
Hi.

965
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:03,914
That's a nice looking
dog you got there.

966
01:08:03,998 --> 01:08:05,249
Thank you.

967
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:07,209
What kind is it?

968
01:08:07,293 --> 01:08:09,670
- Heinz.
- What?

969
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,797
Fifty-seven varieties.

970
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:13,048
What?

971
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:14,425
It's a mutt.

972
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,093
Half Yorkshire, half Shitzu.

973
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:19,388
Oh. Shitzu? Huh.

974
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:20,681
Well, what's his name?

975
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:22,224
Delores.

976
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:23,058
What?

977
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,061
Her name is Delores.

978
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,897
That's a nice name.

979
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:30,441
Hear that, Delores?

980
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:32,234
Say, "Thank you."

981
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,696
We gotta go.

982
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,156
Bye now.

983
01:09:33,963 --> 01:09:36,715
<i>Turn over, Becky.</i>

984
01:09:39,552 --> 01:09:41,053
Come here.
Come here.

985
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:48,102
No!

986
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:50,646
You goddamn bitch.

987
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:03,450
- Otis!
- Oh!

988
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:15,004
You son of a--

989
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:18,090
Oh!

990
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,719
Adios, mother fucker!

991
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:47,870
Please don't!

992
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,460
Please!

993
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:34,041
Relax.
Take it easy.

994
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:35,042
No, no...

995
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:37,169
No, no, no, easy.

996
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:38,837
Why don't you
call the police?

997
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:40,631
- No, no, no.
- What about Otis?

998
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:43,342
- It's not a good idea.
- No.

999
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:46,887
- What are we going to do?!
- Shut up, let me think!

1000
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,472
Shut up!

1001
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:50,933
Let me think!

1002
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,270
Let me think!

1003
01:15:04,418 --> 01:15:06,712
You want to
listen to the radio?

1004
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:10,215
Henry,

1005
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,886
that was so awful.

1006
01:15:16,597 --> 01:15:18,557
I'm scared.

1007
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:23,812
What do we do now?

1008
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:28,400
We just got to keep moving,
that's for sure.

1009
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:34,656
My sister owns a ranch
outside San Bernardino.

1010
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,284
She raises horses there.

1011
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,953
She's got about
a half of dozen of them.

1012
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:41,038
Arabians.

1013
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:42,581
They're beautiful.

1014
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:46,251
We can stay there
as long as we want to.

1015
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:50,255
What about Lurleen?

1016
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:54,635
We'll send for her
as soon as we get there.

1017
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,598
You promise?

1018
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:02,601
I promise.

1019
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:12,819
I love you, Henry.

1020
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:18,200
I guess I love you too.

1021
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:27,584
Where are we
going to go now?

1022
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:30,963
We'll find a place.

1023
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:41,390
You want to listen
to the radio?

1024
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:48,814
Okay.

1025
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:51,942
<i>He's not going to let me.</i>

1026
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:52,985
<i>So you have to stayed tuned,</i>

1027
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:54,820
<i>Tom is going to hand out
those clues a little later.</i>

1028
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:57,239
<i>And now "My Mistake"
by Lynn and the Lizards.</i>

1029
01:16:57,322 --> 01:16:59,950
<i>♪ Loving you was my mistake</i>

1030
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:02,452
<i>♪ My mistake was loving you</i>

1031
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,711
<i>♪ He taught me
all about eternity</i>

1032
01:17:10,794 --> 01:17:13,088
<i>♪ He said that
you were mine eternally</i>

1033
01:18:14,566 --> 01:18:16,651
This is a nice guitar.

1034
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:21,031
I used to play a little,

1035
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:23,367
but I'm out of practice.

1036
01:18:27,913 --> 01:18:29,873
We better go to bed now.
