1
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,922
How was everything?

2
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,299
Real good honey, thanks.

3
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,218
Let me have a pack of
Kools too, would you?

4
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,152
Real nice smile you got there.

5
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,154
Thank you.

6
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:17,780
Good bye.

7
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:18,990
Bye.

8
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,306
(Gun shot)

9
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,181
(Screaming)

10
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,182
Shut up!

11
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,310
(Gun shots)

12
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,729
(Phone ringing)

13
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,287
Shut up, shut up!

14
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,249
(Woman screaming)

15
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,168
Die bitch!

16
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,127
(Woman screaming)

17
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,296
Die!

18
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,085
(Woman screaming)

19
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,376
Well Kathys mom
said she could do it.

20
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,019
Hi, are you going to the city?

21
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,644
Sure.

22
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,354
Hop in.

23
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,725
Becky.

24
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,436
Hello Otis.

25
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,692
Well, how are you?

26
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,944
Good.

27
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:30,945
It's good to see you.

28
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,529
Good to see you, too.

29
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,698
You got all your things?

30
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,741
Yeah.

31
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,288
You look terrible.

32
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,544
Okay, come on let's go.

33
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,672
It's this way.

34
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,644
Before you got
married I told you

35
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,604
Leroy was no damn good.

36
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,480
That he was trash

37
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,648
and he'd always be trash

38
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,525
and you was going to catch
it and you did didn't you?

39
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,985
I don't really want to
talk about him right now.

40
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,237
Okay by me, we don't
have to talk about it now.

41
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,030
We don't have to
talk about it ever.

42
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,199
How long are you
going to be up here?

43
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,325
It's hard to say.

44
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,285
What about Lurleen?

45
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,536
How long can you
leave her with mama?

46
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,996
I don't know.

47
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,414
I'm going to get a job,

48
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,206
make some money.

49
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,291
Maybe bring her up here,

50
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,583
I don't know.

51
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,543
Where did you tell
Leroy you were going?

52
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,003
I don't want
to talk about him.

53
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,839
okay, we don't have
to talk about him!

54
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,093
You hungry?

55
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,052
Yeah.

56
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,595
Good, I'm hungry too.

57
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,474
You think Leroy's hungry?

58
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,646
Do you want some more coffee?

59
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,939
Yeah, thanks.

60
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,149
Here.

61
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,120
So what kind of work do you
planning on getting up here?

62
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,288
Anything like...

63
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,998
I haven't decided yet.

64
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,167
What else can you do
besides dance naked?

65
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,585
Don't start with me Otis.

66
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,670
I can do lots
of things mister.

67
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,921
Oh yea, like what?

68
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,506
Like waitressing

69
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,716
or a beautician.

70
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,759
Yeah.

71
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,887
After seeing you I might
just try brain surgery.

72
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,807
You're a card.

73
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,142
Yeah, I'm the queen.

74
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,895
Yeah, the queen of clubs.

75
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,485
Don't make me
sorry I came here, Otis.

76
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,073
(Door opening)

77
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,370
Howdy.

78
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,621
Hey, Henry.

79
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,248
I brought you a present.

80
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,584
Where did you get that?

81
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,086
Picked it up.

82
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,173
Whew!

83
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,132
Pretty nice, huh?

84
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,218
Sure is a beauty.

85
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,980
Oh, uh...

86
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,650
Henry this here
is my sister, Becky.

87
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,651
She's gonna be staying here

88
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,778
with us for a
while like I said.

89
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,655
Becky this here's Henry.

90
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,657
Hello Henry.

91
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,574
Hello Becky.

92
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,576
Good to meet you.

93
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,662
She don't look
nothing like you,

94
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,704
that's for sure.

95
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,165
Lucky for her.

96
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,792
Henry's on his way out west.

97
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,835
Oh, where?

98
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,752
California.

99
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,671
Oh.

100
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,548
She can sleep on the couch.

101
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,757
No, no.

102
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,802
Listen Becky I want you
to take the spare room.

103
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,387
No, Henry, thank you but no...

104
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,013
I insist.

105
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,515
Ain't that right Otis?

106
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,684
Up to you.

107
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,893
Alright,

108
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,396
but if it gets to be
a bother, we'll change.

109
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,730
Fair enough.

110
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,731
Well, I got to get going.

111
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,316
I got some work to do today.

112
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,860
I just stopped by
to clean up a little.

113
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,819
Where you working?

114
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,239
I'm helping Andy spray
some houses off La Grange.

115
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,324
Oh so that's working
out for you, huh?

116
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,617
Yeah.

117
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,953
Sounds like fun.

118
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,787
Coffee?

119
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,665
No thanks, I gotta go.

120
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,836
See ya.

121
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,962
Yeah.

122
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,113
That's it till next week.

123
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,032
I was hoping for
a little more work.

124
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,909
So was I.

125
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,455
You never know.

126
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,915
Sometimes I get a call.

127
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,124
You know,

128
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,504
these assholes want you to
be out there the next day.

129
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,421
You never know.

130
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,756
Yeah.

131
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,717
Here, take this.

132
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,594
We'll call it a retainer.

133
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,470
Thanks.

134
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,804
You don't here from me

135
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,557
give me a call.

136
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,391
Hold on.

137
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,851
Don't forget your sprayer.

138
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,561
Hang onto it.

139
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,898
Okay.

140
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,070
Come on, kid, come on.

141
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,780
Throw it in there.

142
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,906
Good catch.

143
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,660
Put a spiral on it.

144
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,994
Nice catch.

145
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,541
Sorry about that.

146
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,157
(Woman screaming)

147
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,328
(Sounds of a Struggle)

148
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,817
It's good.

149
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,825
And please check
the left rear tire.

150
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,712
It's good, too.

151
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,673
Thank you.

152
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,091
Yeah.

153
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,559
And what can
I do for you, sir.

154
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,937
You got any more of
what you had last week?

155
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,938
I might.

156
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,148
Well do you, or don't you?

157
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,441
Yeah.

158
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,776
Well?

159
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,320
Well, I don't have
it on me, stupid.

160
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,280
Give me the money.

161
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,995
I'll bring it
around the field.

162
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,163
I don't want you
hanging around practice.

163
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,040
Give me my money back.

164
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,333
Up to you.

165
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,879
Be in the parking lot at 6:30.

166
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,966
Sure thing.

167
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,384
6:30 tomorrow.

168
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,468
Tomorrow?

169
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,220
Take it or leave it.

170
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,096
Great.

171
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,597
See ya.

172
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,603
Fuckin' pervert.

173
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,283
Oh, it's so gross.

174
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,744
I always did hate doing this.

175
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,786
I'll do it.

176
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,496
That's alright.

177
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,086
Where did you say you met him?

178
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,172
Who?

179
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,382
You know who, Henry.

180
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,135
What do you want to know for?

181
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,219
I don't know.

182
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,973
I'm just curious.

183
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,142
Van Dalia.

184
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,518
Van Dalia?

185
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,854
Sure, Van Dalia.

186
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,439
Oh,

187
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,232
what was he in for?

188
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,067
You don't want to know.

189
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,111
What did he do, kill his mama?

190
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,112
Uh- huh.

191
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,198
Come on, what was he in for?

192
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,199
You don't want to know.

193
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,993
What did he do,
rob a bank or something?

194
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,454
You were right the first time.

195
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,288
Huh?

196
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,499
You were right the first time.

197
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,043
He killed his mama.

198
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,337
Don't you ever
tell him I told you.

199
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,463
You're kidding me?

200
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,339
No, I ain't.

201
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,215
Yes you are.

202
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,758
Alright, I'm kidding you.

203
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,093
Just don't ever
tell him I told you.

204
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,095
He killed his mama?

205
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,305
With a baseball bat.

206
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,099
Her and one of her boyfriends.

207
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,392
I swear if you ever
tell him I told you

208
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,144
I'll beat your ass right off.

209
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,395
How do you know all this?

210
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,105
He told me, that's how I know.

211
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,232
How else would I know?

212
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,399
Were you cellmates
or something?

213
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,319
No, we were friends.

214
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,654
When did he get out?

215
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,156
A couple of years before me.

216
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,536
(Door opening)

217
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,541
Hi.

218
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,413
I got some business
I got to take care of.

219
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,163
You going out?

220
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,623
Yeah, for a while,

221
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,709
I got to run an
errand for a fellow.

222
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,587
You want to come along Henry?

223
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,463
No, you go ahead.

224
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,090
Okay.

225
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,675
See you later.

226
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,105
Want to play cards?

227
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,231
U-hu.

228
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,038
What was your daddy like?

229
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,749
My daddy?

230
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,083
He used to drive a truck

231
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:56,004
before he got
his legs cut off.

232
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,048
I remember one time,

233
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,176
he brought me and my
little brother home bicycles.

234
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,552
He had delivered some that day

235
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,388
and he had a couple left over.

236
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,724
But, mine was
way too big for me,

237
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,850
and my brother

238
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,937
he couldn't ride his anyway.

239
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,855
Daddy, he said
I'd grow into it,

240
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,066
but, I never did.

241
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,068
Why not?

242
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,361
I never got the chance,

243
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,321
they sold it.

244
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,239
They sold them both.

245
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,912
So you have a brother?

246
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,746
My brother,

247
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,748
he had a bone disorder.

248
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,251
He was a little deformed.

249
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,129
What happened to him?

250
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,048
He died.

251
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,346
I can't ever remember

252
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,264
really liking my daddy.

253
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,224
I wanted to,

254
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,394
I really did.

255
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,229
One time he bought me,

256
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,148
when I was about five,

257
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,401
he bought me an ice cream cone

258
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,112
and I dropped it.

259
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,196
And he slapped me

260
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,700
and made me
pick it up and eat it.

261
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,371
I never liked my daddy.

262
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,081
One time,

263
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,083
when my momma was at work,

264
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,335
and I was about 13,

265
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,336
he come into my room

266
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,132
and he told me to
take my shirt off

267
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,427
'cause he wanted to see
how I was developed.

268
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,511
And when I wouldn't

269
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,556
he got real mad and he hit me.

270
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,266
And he told me he had a right

271
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,308
because he was my daddy

272
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,019
and I was his daughter

273
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,687
and he fed me

274
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,439
and let me live in his house

275
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,234
and he could do
whatever he wanted.

276
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,738
And he did.

277
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,698
Then he started coming
into my room a lot,

278
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,367
after that.

279
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,452
And I didn't fight him

280
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,913
because when
I did he just hit me.

281
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,000
I was afraid I was
going to have a baby

282
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,961
and that my baby
would be deformed

283
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,297
but, I never got pregnant.

284
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,427
I tried to tell mama,

285
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,389
but she didn't
want to hear about it.

286
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,974
She pretended
not to believe me

287
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,310
but I knew she did.

288
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,398
It sure is good to talk...

289
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,401
to talk to you Henry,

290
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,235
because I know

291
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,320
you're not judgmental

292
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,530
or anything like that.

293
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,535
I never would have married
Leroy in the first place

294
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,747
if I hadn't wanted to get
away from daddy so bad.

295
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,416
Didn't get along
with your daddy, huh?

296
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,926
Did you really kill your mama?

297
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,219
What?

298
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,681
Did you really kill your mama?

299
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,143
I guess I did.

300
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:01,106
How did it happen?

301
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,941
I stabbed her.

302
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,320
Otis said you hit her
with a baseball bat.

303
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,405
Otis said that?

304
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,657
Yeah.

305
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,953
Well, he's mistaken.

306
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,913
Well, don't tell
him I told you,

307
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,458
he made me promise.

308
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,587
She must have
treated you real bad.

309
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,678
She was a whore.

310
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:36,015
My mama was a whore.

311
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,560
But I don't
fault her for that.

312
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,561
It ain't what she done

313
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,813
it's how she done it.

314
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,151
As long as I can remember

315
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,779
she'd be bringing
men up to the house.

316
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,114
My daddy was there too

317
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:56,035
but it didn't
matter none to her.

318
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,497
She'd make me watch it.

319
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,499
That's creepy.

320
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:05,461
She beat me too, a lot.

321
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,215
She beat me when
I wouldn't watch it.

322
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,093
And sometime she'd beat me

323
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,596
make me wear a dress

324
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,682
and watch her doing it.

325
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,018
And then they'd laugh at me.

326
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,520
She made you wear a dress?

327
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,731
You think I'm lying?

328
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,196
I feel like I know you.

329
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,532
Like I've known
you for a long time.

330
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,911
I feel like I've known
you forever and ever.

331
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,754
Yeah...

332
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,300
I killed my mama...

333
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,594
One night,

334
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,056
It was my 14th birthday

335
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,767
and she was drunk and,

336
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,728
we had an argument.

337
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:08,566
She hit me with
a whiskey bottle.

338
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,652
And I shot her.

339
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,655
I shot her dead.

340
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,157
I thought you said
you stabbed her?

341
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,373
Oh yeah.

342
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,586
That's right.

343
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,922
I stabbed her.

344
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,594
(Door opening)

345
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,266
Hey.

346
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,691
Anything good on TV?

347
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,754
I got a job today.

348
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:53,421
Oh yeah?

349
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,255
Doing what?

350
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,548
At a beauty parlor.

351
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,549
A beauty parlor?

352
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,134
I'm a shampoo girl.

353
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,302
What's that?

354
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,803
What's it sound
like, you dummy?

355
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,679
How the hell should I know?

356
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,598
You ever seen me
in a beauty parlor?

357
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,141
I give shampoos,

358
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,434
a woman gets her
hair shampooed

359
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,477
before she gets it cut

360
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,687
and I do it.

361
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,356
They pay you for that?

362
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,815
Of course they do.

363
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,317
Besides I used to
do it some back home

364
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,902
after I met Leroy.

365
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,196
Do you like it better
than dancing naked?

366
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,491
Don't start with me Otis.

367
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,825
You used to dance naked?

368
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,494
Sure, all the time
around the house.

369
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,745
Otis.

370
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,246
Best little naked
dancer you ever saw.

371
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,207
You never.

372
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,794
Were you really a dancer?

373
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,128
I danced some,

374
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,838
in a club,

375
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,882
and I wasn't naked.

376
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,676
I wore a costume.

377
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,762
But I guess it
wasn't very much.

378
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,888
Oh.

379
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,391
When you gonna dance for us?

380
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,019
When the pope
pees in his hat, Otis.

381
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,646
Ain't she got a mouth on her?

382
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,897
I better have something on me

383
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,857
to defend me
from a pig like you.

384
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:55,900
(Making pig sounds)

385
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,360
Otis.

386
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,448
Them's pretty earrings
you got on Becky.

387
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,242
Thank you Henry.

388
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,620
At least there's one
gentleman at this table.

389
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,788
Oh, I'm sorry honey,

390
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,164
now don't get mad.

391
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,833
I was just having
a little fun with you,

392
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,835
that's all.

393
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,335
Oh, wait,

394
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,336
I got something to show you.

395
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:15,837
What?

396
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,796
Wait.

397
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,926
Ta-da!

398
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,345
Nice.

399
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,847
Real nice.

400
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,848
Put it on.

401
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,723
Right now?

402
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,268
Uh-huh.

403
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,895
Okay, but turn around first.

404
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Turn around.

405
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,589
Okay, you can look.

406
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,885
What does it say on there?

407
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,596
I love Chicago.

408
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,597
Looks good,

409
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,598
don't it Otis?

410
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,974
Uh-huh.

411
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:14,812
Oh, hey honey,

412
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,022
Why don't you bring me a beer,

413
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,899
this one's empty.

414
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:18,774
I ain't your maid,

415
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,443
get it yourself.

416
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,069
Oh, now come on honey,

417
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,362
I ain't asking you

418
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,406
to wash the
windows or nothing,

419
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,407
I just want a beer.

420
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,494
Come on, bring your poor
old brother a beer, will ya?

421
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,210
Don't do that Otis,

422
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,252
she's your sister!

423
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,046
Okay, I was only
kidding around, Henry.

424
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,631
Tell her you're sorry.

425
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,758
okay, I'm sorry.

426
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,968
Now, tell her you
won't do it again.

427
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:46,969
I won't,

428
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:50,097
I swear Becky
I swear, I won't.

429
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,057
Ouch!

430
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,934
Shit, Henry!

431
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,813
Serves you right.

432
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:58,940
Thank you, Henry.

433
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,858
That's alright.

434
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,027
Listen, I'll do the dishes.

435
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,487
I don't mind.

436
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,988
I don't.

437
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,794
Listen, why don't you boys

438
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,922
go out and get a beer.

439
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:23,965
I'll do these,

440
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,716
I don't mind, honest.

441
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,935
Well, what do you say Otis?

442
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,898
You want to go grab a beer?

443
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,033
Sure, I don't mind.

444
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,084
I'll just go spruce up.

445
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,676
That was a real
nice supper, Becky.

446
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,844
Thanks.

447
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,514
Have fun.

448
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,476
Yeah.

449
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,050
Ooh.

450
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,929
Ooh, easy.

451
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,681
Aah, mmh,

452
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,183
Easy.

453
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,855
Oh, come on, slow down!

454
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,108
Easy tiger, easy!

455
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,359
Slow down.

456
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,654
Now, wait a minute!

457
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,364
Hey come on, I'm not kidding!

458
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,491
(Sound of neck breaking)

459
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,452
Suzie?

460
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,121
Suzie!

461
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,416
Suzie...aaaaah.

462
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,501
(Sound of neck breaking)

463
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,702
Otis!

464
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:41,787
Come here,

465
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,247
I'll drive.

466
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,061
What's gonna happen
when they find those bodies?

467
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:06,896
Nothing.

468
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,230
What do you mean nothing?

469
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,190
Just what I said Otis,

470
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,441
nothing.

471
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,735
Nothing's gonna happen
cause nothing happened.

472
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,530
And I don't know nothing
about it whatever it is.

473
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,408
Do you?

474
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,328
Hey, I don't know nothing.

475
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,829
Good.

476
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:24,997
Oh, fuck.

477
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,932
Feeling better?

478
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,308
Yeah.

479
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,528
You want some fries?

480
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,230
You telling me you never
killed anybody before?

481
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,148
I ain't saying that.

482
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,568
Then you've killed
before, right?

483
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,529
Well, maybe I didn't
have no choice.

484
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,032
You didn't have no
choice here neither.

485
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,158
Did you?

486
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:46,871
Huh?

487
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,289
Did you?

488
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,583
I don't know,

489
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,336
it ain't the same.

490
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,755
It's always the same,

491
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,383
and it's always different.

492
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,719
What do you mean?

493
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,137
It's either you or them,

494
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,140
one way or the other.

495
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,267
Ain't that right?

496
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,314
Open your eyes, Otis.

497
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,274
Look at the world.

498
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,236
It's either you or them.

499
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,031
You know what I mean.

500
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,119
Yeah.

501
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,790
Good.

502
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,169
You want a beer?

503
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,420
Okay.

504
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,655
There was only one left.

505
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,624
He knows nothing about this

506
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,042
but you can bet
a dollar to a doughnut

507
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,585
that when he finds out,

508
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,629
and he will find out
'cause I'll tell him

509
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,922
there'll be hell to pay.

510
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,798
Really.

511
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,715
I'll never go back there again

512
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,050
I can tell you that.

513
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,552
Not when he's
not there anyway.

514
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,681
First of all there ain't two
of them that speaks English.

515
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,099
It's gone down so badly

516
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,225
the way it's changed

517
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,102
it breaks my heart.

518
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,645
It's like that all over.

519
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,647
People spit at you.

520
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,357
I wish I was lying.

521
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,275
Yeah, you can't have a regular
good time in the city no more.

522
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,435
Ah, shit!

523
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,108
Fuck.

524
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,364
What did you do that for?

525
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,451
I guess I got carried away.

526
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:34,038
Well, I guess you did, Otis.

527
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:39,626
Shit, I got to have a TV.

528
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,796
Well, let's go shopping.

529
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,347
So what can I do
for you gentlemen?

530
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,515
It's hot in here, isn't it?

531
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,391
I'm kind of cold.

532
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,769
We want a TV.

533
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,063
How much you got to spend?

534
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,356
What do you got?

535
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,441
50 bucks.

536
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,611
I can let you have the set
over there for 50 bucks.

537
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,403
Well, turn it on

538
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,530
we want to see if it works.

539
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,323
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

540
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,492
Uh-uh.

541
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,329
Here plug it in down there.

542
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,664
Here?

543
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,290
Yeah, down there, real good.

544
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,376
I see you've had some college.

545
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,754
Like you can see
it works real good.

546
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,506
Just takes a while to warm up.

547
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,799
It's black and white!

548
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,551
Of course it's
black and white.

549
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,177
What do you
expect for 50 bucks?

550
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,762
Fuckin' 3-D for Christ sake.

551
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,556
Well, how much is color?

552
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,974
We want color.

553
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,059
You can't get
color for 50 dollars.

554
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,435
That's okay,

555
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,645
let's see what you got.

556
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,438
What have I got?

557
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,481
You want cable ready?

558
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,816
You want remote control?

559
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,526
You want UHF?

560
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,443
You want 13"?

561
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,237
You want 19"?

562
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,030
I bet you'd
like to have a 19".

563
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,408
You want Sony?

564
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,159
You want Zenith?

565
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,244
You want a Gold Star?

566
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,454
What can we get for a $150?

567
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,540
I can let you have
this set for $150.

568
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,167
It's worth $300.

569
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,543
But here, take a look at this.

570
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,087
For an extra $75,

571
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,840
you can take this $600 set.

572
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,551
What's this?

573
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,844
It's a camcorder.

574
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,553
What?

575
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:55,846
It's a videotape recorder

576
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,639
and camera rolled into one.

577
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,099
You just pop in a cassette

578
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,058
and you're ready to go.

579
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,435
You can make your
own movies with that?

580
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,604
What else would
you do with it?

581
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,980
How much you want for it?

582
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,148
It's worth a grand,

583
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,524
I'd take half.

584
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,483
500 bucks?

585
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,153
Yeah, half of a grand is $500.

586
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,196
That's a little more

587
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,739
than we were
planning to spend.

588
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,949
I think we should
just take the TV.

589
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,493
okay, which one do you want?

590
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,872
The $50 one.

591
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,665
The $50 one.

592
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,541
You guys come in here,

593
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,626
I show this,

594
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,085
I show you that,

595
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,504
and you creeps got
a lousy $50 to spend.

596
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,465
You should have
stopped me a long time ago.

597
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,841
Take the $50 set

598
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,842
and get the hell out,

599
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:34,885
I'm a busy man.

600
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,138
Well, we were really
counting on a color set.

601
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:38,889
What's the matter,

602
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,599
You got shit in your ears?

603
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,059
The black and white is $50,

604
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,435
take it or leave it.

605
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,895
Sorry we wasted your time,

606
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,729
come on, Otis.

607
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:49,024
Don't give me
sorry, you dumb ass!

608
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,234
Did I stutter?

609
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,319
Gimme the $50 and get out!

610
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:52,986
I'll give you 50...

611
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,488
(Screaming)

612
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,576
(Screaming)

613
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,995
(Screaming)

614
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:08,835
(Screaming)

615
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
No!

616
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,768
Otis,

617
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,520
plug it in.

618
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,072
(Music)

619
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,208
Oh get out of here
you're so ugly.

620
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,585
Lurleen, here's
your Uncle Otis.

621
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,713
Hi Lurleen, hi honey,

622
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,506
how are you,
hi it's Uncle Otis.

623
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,301
Henry come dance with me.

624
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,427
Come on, come on, just dance.

625
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,678
Who me?

626
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,470
Yeah.

627
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,096
No, no, no.

628
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,391
Come on Henry.

629
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,559
Come on do it Henry.

630
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,269
All right lets go.

631
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,520
That's it.

632
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,773
Get down.

633
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,775
Wig it as they say here.

634
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,997
More, more,

635
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,333
come on, go for it...

636
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,625

637
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,376
that's it...

638
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,003
Work them hands, Henry.

639
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,964
That's it, that's it.

640
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,050
Lo and behold, what a guy.

641
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,386
Come on, come on,
see look how good it is.

642
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,805
Right there yeah, yeah, yeah.

643
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,890
Come on,

644
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,975
more, more!

645
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,602
More!

646
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,770
More damn it!

647
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,271
Fight your own battles.

648
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,318
Get this...

649
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,986
Turn it off!

650
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,995
Turn it off!

651
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,038
I want more,

652
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:08,789
just a little bit more.

653
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,790
All right.

654
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,793
That's it, that's it,
just a little bit,

655
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:13,668
all right that's it.

656
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,920
Hi baby.

657
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,797
Come on Henry, say hi.

658
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,672
No.

659
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,298
Say hi, Henry.

660
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:19,132
No more, Otis.

661
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,175
Say hi, Henry.

662
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,551
No more, Otis!

663
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,844
He doesn't want to.

664
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,720
Say hi baby.

665
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,180
I said hi.

666
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,312
(Phone ringing)

667
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,814
Yeah?

668
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,275
Uh- huh.

669
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,402
Look I'll do the best I can,

670
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,153
but I don't promise...

671
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,780
Fuck him.

672
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,657
Yeah, yeah, good-bye.

673
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,325
Crazy guy!

674
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,368
What?

675
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,246
Some jerk off hasn't
been out of jail six months,

676
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:49,746
gets drunk,

677
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,039
gets busted up in a fight.

678
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:52,457
So he goes home and gets a gun

679
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,668
and comes back later
and shoots the guy.

680
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,335
They find the gun on him.

681
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:56,962
He claims he was framed.

682
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,713
What are you going to do?

683
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,508
So, everything going okay?

684
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,384
Yeah.

685
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,093
okay,

686
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,720
You still working at Bobs Gas?

687
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,763
Yes sir.

688
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,099
Good, you working every day?

689
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,725
Two, three days a week.

690
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,726
It's a little slow now.

691
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,895
Well, if it's less than
two days a week let me know.

692
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,230
We'll see what
we can do for you.

693
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,232
You still living
at 1801 West North?

694
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,733
Yes sir.

695
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:19,359
Good.

696
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,777
I got to cut it
short today, Otis.

697
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,696
My kid's scheduled
for oral surgery.

698
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,780
I promised to take him over.

699
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:24,906
Sure.

700
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,534
Good, I'll see you next month.

701
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,411
Take it easy.

702
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,871
Bye.

703
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,809
You got it?

704
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,311
Got what?

705
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,979
You know what.

706
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,108
Here you go.

707
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,986
You wanna try it?

708
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,163
Ooh!

709
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,209
God damn, you son of a bitch!

710
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,252
Fuckin'...!

711
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,088
Damn it!

712
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,801
Fucker.

713
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,346
Let me see that.

714
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,557
That little fuckin' bastard.

715
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:33,433
I ought to kill him.

716
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,893
I ought to cut his
fuckin' head off.

717
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,811
That'd be a mistake.

718
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,064
Look who's talking.

719
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,651
Watch your mouth Otis.

720
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,694
I'm sorry, Henry.

721
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:45,820
You kill that high school boy

722
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,113
they're going to slap your ass

723
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,532
right back in jail.

724
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,367
Otis that's a promise.

725
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,911
People have seen you together.

726
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,121
I'd still like
to kill him though.

727
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,831
I bet you would.

728
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,251
I'd like to kill somebody.

729
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,836
Say that again.

730
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,880
I'd like to kill somebody.

731
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,924
Let's me and you
go for a ride Otis.

732
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,894
Here, I want to
show you something.

733
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,145
Where'd you get this?

734
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,271
Careful Otis,

735
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,357
it's loaded.

736
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,524
Where'd you get it?

737
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,485
Guns are easy to get.

738
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,444
I can make a phone call

739
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,820
and get a gun.

740
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,614
Anybody can get a gun Otis.

741
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,449
What do you got in mind Henry?

742
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,034
What do you think?

743
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,748
I don't know.

744
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,458
Put up the hood.

745
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,334
Why?

746
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,544
Just put up the hood, Otis.

747
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,258
You guys need any help?

748
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,552
Otis, do you need some help,

749
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,638
or can you do it yourself?

750
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,818
Feel better?

751
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,903
Yeah.

752
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,280
Alright.

753
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,127
If you shoot somebody

754
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,545
in the head with a 45

755
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,505
every time you kill somebody

756
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,300
it becomes like
your fingerprint see.

757
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,801
But if you strangle one

758
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:37,927
and stab another,

759
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,220
one you cut up

760
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,430
one you don't

761
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,640
then the police
don't know what to do.

762
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,143
They think you're
four different people.

763
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,103
What they really like,

764
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,230
what makes their
job so much easier,

765
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,191
a pattern.

766
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,611
What they call
a modus operandi.

767
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,112
That's Latin.

768
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,114
Bet you didn't know
any Latin, did ya?

769
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,117
Big fuckin' deal.

770
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,160
What?

771
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,953
Nothing.

772
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,791
It's like a trail
of shit, Otis.

773
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,125
It's like a blood droppings

774
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,044
from a deer you've shot

775
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,086
and all they gotta do

776
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,338
is follow those droppings

777
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,217
and pretty soon they're
going to find that deer.

778
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:31,231
Why do we use a gun?

779
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,149
You can use a gun.

780
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,026
I'm not saying
you can't use a gun.

781
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,238
Just don't use
the same gun twice.

782
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,326
The most important
thing is to keep moving.

783
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,288
That way they might
never catch up to you.

784
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,289
I'm gonna have to pack up

785
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,166
and be on the move
too, pretty soon.

786
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,210
Where are you going?

787
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,586
Nowhere.

788
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,005
You wanna come?

789
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,676
We could be back this
way in about a month.

790
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,219
I'm not supposed
to leave the state

791
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,095
without telling them.

792
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,137
So who's gonna know?

793
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,222
As long as you show up

794
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,307
when you're supposed to?

795
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,185
What if they check
up on me at work?

796
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,897
Well, no plan is perfect.

797
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,122
Bring her in.

798
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,081
Bring her in Otis.

799
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,207
Come on.

800
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,959
That's it.

801
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:15,710
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:16,377
Sit down.

803
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,379
Sit her down.

804
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,505
Oh, good, good,
good, good, good.

805
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,465
Take her blouse off.

806
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,633
Take it off.

807
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,844
Oh yeah, Otis, good.

808
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,347
My oh, yeah, yeah.

809
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,057
Skirt, skirt, skirt.

810
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:29,724
Do it Otis,

811
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:30,975
you're a star.

812
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,315
(Man gagged and screaming)

813
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:40,860
Shut up!

814
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,195
Shut up!

815
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,200
I'll do what the hell
I want to do bitch!

816
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,327
Leave me alone!

817
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,244
Leave me alone!

818
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,245
Do it Otis.

819
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,705
Do it.

820
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,624
Henry look.

821
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,376
You got it.

822
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,669
Go for it boy.

823
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,924
Shut up!

824
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,302
Get the fuckin' kid!

825
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:13,351
(Screaming)

826
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,286
(Sound of neck breaking)

827
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,371
Son of a bitch!

828
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,998
Henry, look!

829
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,791
(Sound of neck breaking)

830
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,471
(Stabbing and groaning sounds)

831
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,609
Hey Henry?

832
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,028
Henry?

833
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,364
What?

834
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,282
Hi!

835
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,241
Looky here, where you at.

836
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,117
Bye!

837
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,826
Where you at?

838
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,578
Say hello, honey!

839
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,371
I have to wave to my baby.

840
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:16,414
Henry, bye.

841
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,291
Henry, look at this, Henry.

842
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,751
Ain't that a view.

843
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,503
Otis!

844
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,130
No, Otis!

845
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,506
Otis!

846
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,633
No!

847
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,844
Let's go!

848
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,236
What are you doing?

849
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,988
I want to see it again.

850
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:28,611
In jail?

851
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,113
Are you sure?

852
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,660
Is Lurleen there?

853
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,328
Does she know?

854
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,164
In the what,

855
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:41,999
in the army?

856
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,461
Go get her, will you?

857
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,509
Hi.

858
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,219
Hi.

859
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,012
Hi, hi.

860
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,600
Do you miss me?

861
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,894
I miss you.

862
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,275
You did?

863
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,486
That's wonderful.

864
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,405
Are you being a good girl?

865
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,162
I don't think so honey.

866
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,456
I know I promised, but uh...

867
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,084
a couple of things
have happened here.

868
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,591
I know, he is a good soldier.

869
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,722
Soon, real soon, I promise.

870
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,852
I love you, too.

871
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,689
Yeah, put your
grandma back on, okay?

872
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,569
Hi.

873
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,282
I know.

874
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,909
I'll think about it.

875
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,165
I can't right now.

876
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,625
I will, soon.

877
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,378
I can't talk now okay,

878
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,797
I gotta go.

879
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,466
Okay.

880
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,800
Bye.

881
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,516
Great, great.

882
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,976
Oh!

883
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,770
Oh!

884
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,105
I got one,
I got one, here, look.

885
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,024
Oh, look, look,
look, look, look.

886
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:30,942
Look at this,
look at this.

887
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,485
Tight on there huh.

888
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,736
Yeah, no, no, no,

889
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,904
oh, no, I like
this one better.

890
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,031
Look Henry, Henry look.

891
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,241
Oh, yeah, I love it,

892
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,075
I love her.

893
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,076
Oh god, how she looks,

894
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,577
isn't she pretty.

895
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,037
Ah god, look at that dress,

896
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,580
look at the way it moves.

897
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,249
Oh yeah!

898
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,376
Pull up next to
her, real slow.

899
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,919
(Hits camera)

900
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,672
Look what you did!

901
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:53,923
Oh God!

902
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,008
Oh Jesus!

903
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,720
Look at it, it's ruined.

904
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,306
Damn Henry you ought to
look where you're driving.

905
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,015
Who the hell told you

906
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,976
to stick your head
out the window anyway?

907
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,060
You could have killed me!

908
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,270
Oh, that's right.

909
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,064
Blame it on me!

910
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,526
Oh, this fucking camera!

911
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,070
What did you do that for?

912
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,989
It wasn't any good anymore.

913
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,407
Could have fixed it.

914
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,742
Shit, the lens was
busted right off!

915
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:22,702
Could have fixed it!

916
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,619
How do you know,

917
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:26,664
you a camera repair man.

918
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:27,748
You should have
said something.

919
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,250
You didn't give
me a chance, Otis.

920
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,168
You threw the fucker
right out the window.

921
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,670
It ain't my fault it broke.

922
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,463
Oh right.

923
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,217
Go back and get
it if you want.

924
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:39,510
Yeah.

925
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,686
Want to get a beer?

926
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,688
Not particularly.

927
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,523
I want a beer.

928
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,736
If you want a
beer so bad, Otis,

929
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,780
go ahead and get one.

930
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,782
All right, I will.

931
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:06,537
See you later.

932
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,997
Yeah.

933
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,672
I talked to Lurleen.

934
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,799
Yeah?

935
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,385
You'd like her.

936
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,305
God, I miss her.

937
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,890
I'm thinking,

938
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:29,685
I might be
heading on back home.

939
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,312
I quit.

940
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,147
You quit what?

941
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,609
My job.

942
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,735
What happened?

943
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,778
Nothing.

944
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,697
I just figured it
was time to go home.

945
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,037
You want to come with me?

946
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,414
I thought you wanted
to make some money?

947
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:53,376
Yeah, but,

948
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,752
I'm thinking,

949
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,129
I don't want to bring
Lurleen up here after all.

950
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,048
You know,
that was my intention.

951
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:04,470
There's just too
much going on up here.

952
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,222
She'd get lost.

953
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:13,687
We're better off
living with mama.

954
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,773
I can work back home,

955
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,734
I won't make as much
money I'm sure, but,

956
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,820
I won't need as much either.

957
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:25,408
And I can live with mama.

958
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:29,829
You can stay there, too.

959
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,956
You figure it's
safe to go back?

960
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,750
I hope so.

961
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,168
Leroy's in jail for murder

962
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,046
and his bond's
a million dollars.

963
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,549
So, unless he wins the lottery

964
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:46,095
Leroy won't be going
anywhere for quite a while.

965
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,848
Where's Otis?

966
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:52,309
He had a dinner
date I think he said.

967
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,936
Really?

968
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,229
Well.

969
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,692
Come with me?

970
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,652
When are you leaving?

971
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,864
Tomorrow.

972
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:05,948
Hmm.

973
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,164
Better think fast Henry.

974
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,957
You got your ticket?

975
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,917
Not yet.

976
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,712
But my mind's made up.

977
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,797
Might as well just do it.

978
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,720
Might as well.

979
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,181
I'd rather ride with you.

980
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,352
Let me think about it.

981
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,732
I'll tell you what,

982
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,858
let's me and you

983
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,234
go get us a steak dinner,

984
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,944
I'm buying, huh.

985
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,864
I got a new Visa card
I want to try out.

986
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,240
You've got a Visa card?

987
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,952
Yeah, who you think you're
associating with anyway?

988
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,538
Great, let's go.

989
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,414
Alright.

990
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,832
Where are we going?

991
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,584
We'll find a place.

992
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,171
Grab your jacket and let's go.

993
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,980
I gotta go to the bathroom.

994
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,232
Okay.

995
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,964
He's passed out.

996
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,022
I ain't
interrupting nothing, am I?

997
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,988
You guys want a beer?

998
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,034
You got any cigarettes?

999
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,077
Not since Superman died.

1000
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,584
I gotta, go out and
get some cigarettes,

1001
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,293
get some air.

1002
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:05,127
Henry?

1003
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,045
I'll be right back I promise,

1004
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,546
I just need some air.

1005
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,964
Henry.

1006
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,466
You want anything?

1007
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,929
Otis?

1008
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,848
Uh- uh.

1009
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,817
How about getting your
poor ol' brother a beer?

1010
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,161
Hi.

1011
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,204
Two packs of Kools.

1012
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:22,996
What kind?

1013
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,039
What?

1014
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:24,748
What kind?

1015
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,959
Milds, Regulars, 100's...

1016
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,252
Regulars.

1017
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,005
Two, sixty.

1018
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,098
Hey, how about those Bears?

1019
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,016
Fuck the Bears.

1020
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,478
Okay.

1021
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,077
Hi.

1022
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,120
Hi.

1023
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,164
That's a nice looking
dog you got there.

1024
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,290
Thank you.

1025
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,208
What kind is it?

1026
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,418
Heinz.

1027
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,544
What?

1028
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,880
57 varieties.

1029
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,173
What?

1030
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,549
It's a mutt,

1031
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,259
half Yorkshire, half Shitzu.

1032
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,471
Oh, Shitzu, huh.

1033
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,847
What's his name?

1034
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,307
Delores.

1035
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,099
What?

1036
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,102
Her name is Delores.

1037
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,230
That's a nice name.

1038
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:31,607
Hear that Delores?

1039
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,317
Say thank you.

1040
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:36,862
We gotta go.

1041
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,447
Bye now.

1042
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,083
(Screaming)

1043
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,177
Come here,
come here, come here.

1044
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,263
(Screaming)

1045
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,476
No!

1046
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,770
You god damn bitch.

1047
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,730
(Screaming)

1048
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,739
(Screaming)

1049
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:16,169
You son of a...

1050
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,551
Adios, mother fucker!

1051
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:28,765
(Screaming)

1052
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:33,622
(Crying)

1053
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,290
Relax, take it easy.

1054
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,293
No, no, no, easy.

1055
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,045
Why don't you call the police?

1056
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,213
No, no, no.

1057
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,005
What about Otis?

1058
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:42,923
It's not a good idea.

1059
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,466
No.

1060
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,884
What are we going to do?

1061
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,220
Shut up, let me think!

1062
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,429
Shut up!

1063
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,432
Let me think!

1064
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,770
Let me think!

1065
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:40,063
(Sound of cutting)

1066
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,258
(Splash)

1067
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,651
(Splash)

1068
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,546
You want to
listen to the radio?

1069
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,674
Henry.

1070
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,260
That was so awful.

1071
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,723
I'm scared.

1072
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,563
What do we do now?

1073
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,939
We just got to keep moving,

1074
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:31,610
that's for sure.

1075
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:32,527
My sister owns a ranch

1076
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:35,739
outside San Bernardino.

1077
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,491
She raises horses there.

1078
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,077
She's got about
1/2 dozen of them.

1079
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,204
Arabians.

1080
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,706
They're beautiful.

1081
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:49,586
We can stay there
as long as we want to.

1082
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,215
What about Lurleen?

1083
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,216
We'll send for her,

1084
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,637
soon as we get there.

1085
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,765
You promise?

1086
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,892
I promise.

1087
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,568
I love you Henry.

1088
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,157
I guess, I love you too.

1089
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:30,085
Where are we going to go now?

1090
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,087
We'll find a place.

1091
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,681
You want to
listen to the radio?

1092
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,355
Okay.

1093
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,485
(urns on radio)

1094
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,734
This is a nice guitar.

1095
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,238
I used to play a little.

1096
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,866
But, I'm out of practice.

1097
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,956
We better go to bed now.
