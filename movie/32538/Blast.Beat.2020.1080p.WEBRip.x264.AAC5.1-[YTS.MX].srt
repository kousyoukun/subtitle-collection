00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,518
What a cutie.

4
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,038
Scared or what?

5
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,125
These pigeons are psycho.

6
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,650
Check out that little dog!

7
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,028
Watch out! You'll get scabies.

8
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,740
Damn, hold on. Have you tried chicha?

9
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,782
What's chicha?

10
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,326
You're so Miami.

11
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,536
Try that.

12
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,632
Gross!

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,219
Dude, drink this instead.

14
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,816
Check it out, Mafe.

15
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,986
Look at how the solar panels activate
with the new photocell.

16
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,947
Shit's so cool!

17
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,324
Damn, babe, it's starting
to look like the real thing.

18
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,468
Got it.

19
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,953
<i>The processor keeps lagging, but...</i>

20
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,290
I'll beef it up once I get
to join the Aerospace Institute.

21
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,666
BOGOTÁ, COLOMBIA - SUMMER '99

22
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,043
It's gonna turn out so fucking sick.

23
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,296
I'll send you pictures
when it looks like a satellite.

24
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,338
Get the camera!

25
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,381
-You ready?
-Okay.

26
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,383
-Grab the camera. Film me.
-Wait. Carly, wait!

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,595
Ready?

28
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,482
So sick, babe! You nailed it!

29
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,695
Was that sick or what?

30
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,741
Nah, dude...
the whole thing's a fucking fiasco.

31
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,076
You think they were gonna say no to him?

32
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:10,250
My brother shoved
that fucking Georgia Aerospace Institute

33
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,211
so far down their throats... Watch it.

34
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,923
It's all we talk about now.

35
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,301
That's so messed up, bro.

36
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,095
My parents don't even speak English.

37
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,847
I don't know, man.

38
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,891
To me that's like chickening out
of the problem.

39
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,060
When my dad hired his bodyguards,

40
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,396
he said the damn Guerrillas weren't
gonna bully him out of his own country.

41
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,985
I don't give a shit anymore, dude.
Fuck the American Dream.

42
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,280
Why couldn't your brother graduate
and leave by himself?

43
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,491
'Cause he's a fucking selfish asshole,
that's why.

44
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,662
-Dude.
-So what?

45
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,248
So your dad's really buying you
out of the army?

46
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,125
Bro, so that I can "focus" on my studies.

47
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,712
But you know what?
I'm gonna get so much ass!

48
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,849
Shit, dude!

49
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:10,936
Check it out, bro.

50
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,441
To keep you hydrated over there.

51
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,696
Thanks.

52
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,823
All good.

53
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,368
Fucking sweet.

54
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,126
Hey! Vandals!

55
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,961
Shit! The pigs! Run!

56
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,045
Stop right there! Stop!

57
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,731
Go easy tonight, babe, please.
You kind of go crazy when you drink.

58
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,818
Mafe. It's my last night with everyone.
I feel like I deserve it, no?

59
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,614
Besides, I'm not playing any more games
when I'm in the States.

60
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,990
Gonna be a new Carly.

61
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,451
But I wanna be able to spend
some time with you, babe.

62
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,833
I got you a little goodbye present.

63
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,635
No.

64
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,470
Holy shit... Emperor?

65
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,473
Mafe, you didn't have to.

66
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,475
-You like it?
-I do.

67
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:32,893
And this?

68
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,771
Just a little surprise.

69
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,815
Hey, that's Teo.

70
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,778
Dude, run!

71
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,531
Now what?

72
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,051
The guy has three lungs!

73
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,142
Fuck.

74
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,571
Stop!

75
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,575
Stop!

76
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,258
-Norby!
-Mateo! Mateo!

77
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,765
Go, Norby!

78
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,604
Dispatch, do you copy?
I need backup on 5th Street!

79
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:04,443
Norby! Get up, dude! To the dollhouse!

80
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,122
Be quiet, bro. They'll catch us.

81
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,459
Check it out.

82
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,088
Put that shit away!
The fuck's wrong with you?

83
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,216
Come on. You chickenshit?

84
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,135
If we get caught,
my dad won't buy me out of the army.

85
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,721
No, Teo! No, dude!

86
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,306
You're fucking insane!

87
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,724
You stay put, Doc.

88
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,934
Fuck!

89
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,276
Norby! Norby!

90
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,042
That shit was so loud,
my ears are still ringing.

91
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,669
Yeah. Fucking hilarious, dude.

92
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,090
Dumbass! Wanna get arrested,
fucking idiot?

93
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,216
Why would you do that?

94
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,926
Dude, I told him not to! Moron!

95
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,678
What the fuck were you thinking?

96
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,887
I can't... breathe...

97
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,932
-Yo, chill, chill. chill.
-Get out of the way, Norby!

98
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,477
You're not gonna fuck up
my plans, dipshit.

99
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,689
-Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.
-Pig's coming!

100
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,747
You fucked up for real, bro.

101
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,332
Chill, dude. They didn't even get us.

102
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,715
If you take any of my things again,
I'll beat you up!

103
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm gonna tell Mom.

104
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,808
Norby! Weren't we gonna get a few beers?

105
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,895
Dude, come on... To say goodbye.

106
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,653
Tio Jorge is coming early tomorrow
to take out the rest of the furniture.

107
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,614
I told him you'd help him.

108
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,656
All right.

109
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,536
How much did Tio Jorge give you?

110
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,829
A hundred bucks?

111
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,247
I got way more.

112
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,459
Bullshit.

113
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,086
Mom, Carly has something to tell you.

114
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,051
Nothing, Ma. They're throwing me
a goodbye concert tonight.

115
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,093
I'll be back late.

116
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,352
<i>"Everyone or no one,</i>

117
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,521
<i>because this is about politics,
not economics,"</i>

118
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,482
<i>was the demand
that the ELN received from the families</i>

119
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,193
<i>of the 24 victims of Flight 94-63</i>

120
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,195
<i>who still remain kidnapped by the rebels.</i>

121
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,072
<i>We don't want any more excuses.</i>

122
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,492
<i>We just want them to release
all our family members, please.</i>

123
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,620
<i>Meanwhile, tomorrow the deployment
of 1,000 soldiers</i>

00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,288
<i>of the 5th National Army battalion</i>

125

00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,918

arrived today</i>

127
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,087
<i>to start a dialogue
with the guerilla revolutionaries.</i>

128
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:23,225
My dear Nelly. You're too brave!

129
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,729
I'd be terrified if I were you!

130
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:32,109
Just imagine...
moving to a country so far away,

131
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,529
with no friends, no family,
no acquaintances...

132
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,531
and without speaking the language?

133
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:42,619
No! Hats off to you, my dear Nellycita.

134
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,415
Of course I'm scared, Leonorcita.

135
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,625
But what else can we do?

136
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,587
Pay the extortion money?

137
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,174
Absolutely not. Those criminals
will never get a single cent from us.

138
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,550
Of course not.

139
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,886
But don't worry, my dears.

140
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,429
We'll be just fine.

141
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,890
You know
how well Ernesto takes care of us.

142
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:08,020
He's sorting out the asylum papers
with a highly recommended lawyer,

143
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:14,193
and he already found us a beautiful home
in a really nice and safe neighborhood.

144
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,198
I'm sure we'll settle in a heartbeat.

145
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,450
So you already saw pictures
of your new home?

146
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,828
No, not yet.

147
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:29,625
But Ernesto painted
such a pretty picture over the phone,

148
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,252
I really can't wait to see it.

149
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,880
You must really miss him, no?

150
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:39,051
Yes. We're coming up on half a year now.

151
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,137
Well, I'm so happy
you're all going to be together again.

152
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,348
Yes, soon.

153
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,558
Are you boys looking forward to it?

154
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,477
You kidding, Doña Alcira?

155
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,940
I can't wait to start
at the Aerospace Institute.

156
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,275
-Oh, so they accepted you already.
-I wish.

157
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,945
If I want to work at NASA,

158
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,947
I have to go through
a school like that first.

159
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,241
There's no other way.

160
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,910
And you, Mateíto?
How do you feel about all of this?

161
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,287
Ah, my dear Leonorcita,

162
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,456
while I do love Bogotá,

163
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,710
let me tell you that I'm also super,
duper, excited to leave all my friends.

164
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,381
-You know what I'm even more stoked about?
-Teo.

165
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,927
I'll finally become
an obese piece of shit.

166
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,720
Hey! Don't be so abusive!

167
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,141
I'm gonna take a piss.
Later, ladies. Take care!

168
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,021
How rude.

169
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:36,233
Don't worry, Nellycita.
I'm sure Mateíto will grow out of it.

170
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,319
Me too, Doña Alcira.

171
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,263
Carly!

172
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,640
Carly!

173
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,019
Carly, we need to talk!

174
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:39,815
-There's nothing to talk about!
-Then just listen. Let me talk.

175
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,567
Come here.

176
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,698
I thought you were gonna give me
a chance to say goodbye to you.

177
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,409
Mafe, we spent the whole day together,
and now we're here.

178
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,827
What else do you want?

179
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,456
Can you stop drinking for a second?

180
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,584
Jeez, get off my ass already.

181
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,043
You're such an asshole!

182
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,761
Can you tell me that I can come visit you
like I visit my friends in Miami?

183
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,513
That's not gonna happen.

184
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:21,273
There, there, Mafe. Come here.

185
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,442
There, there.

186
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,988
Mafe, I'm just being real.

187
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,073
I don't mean to hurt you. I don't.

188
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,036
But we're young and we have
to be open to all the possibilities.

189
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,496
And we're always gonna be friends, okay?

190
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,790
Just have fun with me, please!

191
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,044
Mafe, please.

192
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,257
I wanna thank Mafe.

193
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,259
She's the one
who put all this shit together

194
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:53,055
to give this hairy stud
a proper send-off to NASA!

195
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,307
We're gonna miss you so much, bro.

196
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,106
<i>Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!</i>

197
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,375
Hey, Teo.

198
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,294
The fuck...

199
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,672
He got way too shit-faced this time.

200
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,884
Chill, bro. I can walk on my own.

201
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,261
And lost his keys.

202
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,097
Let go already!

203
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,683
Thanks for bringing him.

204
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,519
You should've come tonight, Teo.
It would've been good to see you.

205
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,313
-See you later, lil' bro.
-You got it.

206
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,284
Careful not to wake Mom.

207
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,078
Shush yourself.

208
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,753
Oh, my bed. My bed!

209
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,174
Help me out, bro. Help me.

210
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,932
Dude, I'm so fucking wasted.

211
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,685
Go to sleep.

212
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,103
Mateo.

213
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,982
Everyone made it out, Teo.
I had such a blast.

214
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,525
Good for you.

215
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,113
Dude...

216
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,701
I know you fucking hate that we're moving.

217
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,037
But you're such a cool dude,

218
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,165
you're gonna make friends
no matter where you go.

219
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,758
Don't worry.

220
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,794
Toucan.

221
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,672
Perfect self-portrait, bro.

222
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,633
Don't fuck with me, man.
We're even after last night.

223
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,551
Even?

224
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,262
Why would you do that
to my present, idiot?

225
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,098
Grow up.

226
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,104
Dude, you just trashed it!

227
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,857
-Mateo Adrian, behave!
-Me?

228
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,902
Tell him that!
Look what he did to my drawing!

229
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,490
That's what happens
when you fuck with my things.

230
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,284
Carlos Andres, that's enough.

231
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:01,827
Just wait and see.

232
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,912
I'm shaking.

233
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,083
That's it. Both of you shut up.

234
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,674
<i>The captain has illuminated
the fasten-seat-belts sign.</i>

235
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:19,970
<i>We do ask that you return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.</i>

236
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,810
It's so damn hot.

237
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:33,984
<i>The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.</i>

238
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,152
<i>No parking.</i>

239
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,831
Family! Come here!

240
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,459
My love...

241
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,919
My darling.

242
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,922
I missed you so much.

243
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,673
Me too, my love.

244
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,800
You're so gorgeous.

245
00:20:58,884 --> 00:20:59,801
Come here, son!

246
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,845
I missed you so much, Dad.

247
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,139
Me too. And check out that hair.

248
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,058
Beautiful.

249
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,560
What happened, Teo? Come here.

250
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,021
Why don't we get out of here?
We're blocking traffic.

251
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,025
Say hi to your father.

252
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,365
Man, I love you so much!

253
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,075
Let's get going.

254
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,589
Damn. This place is about
to fall over, no?

255
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,886
I know it needs some love,
but this is our home now.

256
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:11,350
We can fix it up.
Do the windows, some paint.

257
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,394
We can even get a cool mailbox.

258
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,357
Plus, this is a really safe neighborhood.

259
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:23,320
And real estate like this is
a wise investment.

260
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,865
Yeah, Dad. It's got solid bones.

261
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,619
I'll give you a hand with the renovations.

262
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,580
Well, I didn't picture it like this
from what you said.

263
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:38,377
But the area is beautiful...

264
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,297
and feels so peaceful.

265
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,010
You know what I'm thinking, Charito?

266
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:50,389
Some pretty flowers right here
would breathe new life into the house.

267
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,560
I really see it, sweetie.
I love that idea. Let's do it.

268
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,236
Come in, don't be shy.

269
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,867
That's it. Come on in.

270
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,161
Stay here.
I have a little surprise for you.

271
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,967
Pa, so sick! A pro bike?

272
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,137
With pegs and no brakes? So dope!

273
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,763
So you only got one bike?

274
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,350
Yeah, but check out what I got you.

275
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,186
I saw a commercial for it,

276
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,814
and I said to myself,
that's Teo right there.

277
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:46,069
Seriously? I'm gonna look like
a freaking idiot riding that shit.

278
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,614
Don't you like skating and all that stuff?

279
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,740
No, I see what you did.

280
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,075
You saved money on me
to buy Carlotta a dope bike.

281
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,328
Fine touch, Dad. Real nice.

282
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,457
Teo, come back. Son, come on.

283
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,710
Don't stress, Dad. He's just ungrateful.

284
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,339
I thought he'd like it.

285
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,132
How do you buy just one bike?

286
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:23,232
Nice, Dad. They survived the trek.

287
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,075
Smells like ass.

288
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,177
No fucking way.

289
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,020
Now we're talking.

290
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,696
I call this room!

291
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:15,701
Get out of my room.

292
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:19,121
What the hell? I literally just called it.
Everyone heard me.

293
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,957
No, Ma! Pa! You heard me call the room!

294
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,792
Tell Carlotta to get out!

295
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,378
Enough, Mateo Adrian!

296
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:31,508
I'm not sharing a wall with Carlos Andres
and his Satanic music!

297
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,427
Your room is next door.

298
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,180
Go!

299
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,560
Good God, Mateo!

300
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,980
Fuck! My solar panels.

301
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:48,275
I'm gonna fucking kill you this time!

302
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,076
You're gonna have to pay me back
every single cent, moron! Open up!

303
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,579
-Calm down!
-You're gonna break the door!

304
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,332
No, I'm not gonna calm down!
He's completely out of control!

305
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,959
He set the Bethancourts' dollhouse
on fire before we left!

306
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,295
-He what?
-He's crazy.

307
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,281
<i>We can't go on like this.</i>

308
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,367
Fighting over every little thing.

309
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,080
You're brothers.
You're supposed to lift each other up.

310
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:08,874
Here.

311
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:19,301
Honey, the clinic asked me to paint
all the halls and the courtyard outside.

312
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:23,889
I'm gonna hire some help. A couple guys.

313
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,892
The job's decent money.

314
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:31,480
So don't worry, we're all here now.

315
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:39,363
Hey, Carly, when do you apply to the...?

316
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,281
-In October.
-Good.

317
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,409
Here, we must have clear goals.

318
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,787
Focus on that application, Carly.

319
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,206
Remember that your college savings fund

320
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,375
will only cover a fraction
of your tuition.

321
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,545
So start looking for those scholarships.

322
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,172
Yes, sir. I'll look into it.

323
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,762
Teo, what do you want to study?

324
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:07,182
And please don't say Fine Arts.

325
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,727
It better be something you can rely on.

326
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,438
Ask me or ask your brother
if you need guidance.

327
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,568
Clear goals.

328
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,788
I get you, buddy.

329
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,875
I never ratted out my brothers either.

330
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,670
But Carly's such a straight arrow.

331
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,214
You know that.

332
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:23,634
Straight arrow...

333
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,096
It's been tough being away from you guys.

334
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:33,602
Sometimes I wondered if we made
the right choice moving out here.

335
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,105
Especially in the beginning, just imagine,

336
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:40,609
giving up my successful businesses
to work this hard.

337
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,152
Really tough, buddy.

338
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:46,448
I didn't understand anything.
Couldn't talk to anyone.

339
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,243
It was a nightmare.

340
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:55,499
But little by little,
I started to meet people around here

341
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,209
and I let myself be guided.

342
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,921
And now, look, we're together again.

343
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,300
You have to be grateful in life, buddy.

344
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,306
Mateo.

345
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:14,768
Promise me one thing.

346
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,898
Please promise me
you'll make an effort to fit in, okay?

347
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,155
Okay, Pa.

348
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:31,952
Yeah.

349
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:40,669
So have you been doing
some push-ups or what?

350
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,964
-Yeah, I had to.
-Had to?

351
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:49,136
I'm not gonna let Carly
or anybody walk all over me.

352
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:53,974
So watch it, Dad.

353
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:55,934
Watch out.

354
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,608
Pretty nice, right?

355
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,652
It's not even that far from home.

356
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,865
You know what you boys should do?
Practice your English with each other.

357
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,201
That way you get
the hang of things quickly.

358
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,577
Good idea, Ma.

359
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,081
-Stop.
-What?

360
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,710
I don't wanna be seen
in this piece-of-shit car.

361
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,045
Really, son?

362
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,254
Be careful.

363
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,548
See you back at home, Ma.

364
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,800
Okay, son. Take care.

365
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,135
Hey!

366
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,266
You wanna tie your scooter with my bike?

367
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,525
Oh, missed me!

368
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,068
-Hit me! Hit me!
-Go.

369
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,654
Come on. Go, go, go. Go long.

370
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,864
Touchdown.

371
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,284
Hey! Idiot!

372
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,078
What did you just call me, little bitch?

373
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:40,831
Damn straight, Jose.

374
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,668
I'm gonna eat your head next time,
fucking chili shitter.

375
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,628
-Relax.
-Fuck off.

376
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,797
Look at his face.

377
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:54,219
Man, what the fuck is going on
around here?

378
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:56,388
Shut the fuck up, little bitch.

379
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,101
I wouldn't fuck with him.

380
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,396
Trust me. Shit, his dad's a lawyer.

381
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:06,440
Yeah.

382
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,193
-I'm Teo.
-Byron.

383
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:15,699
Welcome to hell, man.

384
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:26,418
All right, now,
you should have covered this last year.

385
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:27,503
Let's assume...

386
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:34,134
that these two objects
are symmetrical spheres.

387
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,431
Okay? How would you calculate
the gravitational force between them

388
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,101
if the distance is nine meters?

389
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,273
Anybody? Yeah, Ms. Spike.

390
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:52,861
-You would multiply the masses on top?
-Just eliminate the units that cancel out.

391
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:58,325
Then that's 225 divided by 81,
times the constant,

392
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:01,912
which is 1.9.

393
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:09,127
-That's technically correct, Mr. Res--?
-Restrepo.

394
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,672
And it's not technically correct, sir.
It is correct.

395
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,636
Maybe it's right.

396
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,389
And maybe that's how you did things
where you came from,

397
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,891
but in America, there are no shortcuts.

398
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,017
We show our work.

399
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,187
Everybody got that?

400
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,330
And push-ups!

401
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,501
One! Two! Three!

402
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,218
Hey.

403
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,013
I'm Teo.

404
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,725
-Did anybody see you?
-No, the coach wasn't looking.

405
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,729
Funny accent, dude. I'm Nessa.

406
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,148
Can I smoke with you guys?

407
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:24,203
Who is this?

408
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,331
Is he cool?

409
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,249
So far.

410
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,584
I just move here.

411
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:32,753
-From where?
-Colombia.

412
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,547
What part of Mexico is that?

413
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:40,010
Seriously? Colombia's in South America.

414
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:43,013
Jeez. Just trying to make
nice conversation, dude.

415
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:46,600
-Don't freak out.
-I'm not freaking out. I'm just saying.

416
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:49,978
Yeah.

417
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,565
He's not cool.

418
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,568
This is kicked. Let's go.

419
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,148
You got any games on your TI-89?

420
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,568
I don't play games.

421
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:51,373
That gravity problem, dude,
you solved that all in your head?

422
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,170
There's one in this chapter
with a double variable. It's a bitch.

423
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:05,554
Make it a system.

424
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,850
Then find values for each of the unknowns
by replacing them with functions.

425
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:12,895
You got games now.

426
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,858
Holy shit. Fucking shooter games?

427
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,569
-You're Spanish, right?
-Colombian.

428
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,780
Same thing. How come you speak English?

429
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,950
My school was bilingual.

430
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,829
You should learn Spanish.
Half the world speaks it.

431
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:31,997
Shit. I croaked.

432
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,044
<i>Nightside Eclipse</i> Emperor shirt,

433
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:41,340
long hair, black leather jacket
in the dead of summer.

434
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:44,885
Let's see if you really know
your shit, poser.

435
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,185
Name this band.

436
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,980
That's so badass.

437
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:02,444
But 21 years in the can is nothing
for first-degree murder, no?

438
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,076
It must have hurt.

439
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:10,994
Kind of liked it.

440
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:15,916
Fight!

441
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:18,877
Oh, shit!

442
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:25,884
Fuck you say to me, you little bitch?

443
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:41,984
That's it! It's over! Enough!
Get off him and shut the fuck up!

444
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,527
Get off him. Shut up!

445
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,153
-Fuck you!
-Hey!

446
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:48,073
Calm down, Jared! Come on, man.

447
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,660
Just calm down. Walk.
Hey, you! You! You come with me!

448
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,871
-Go home!
-Turn around and go!

449
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:02,004
It's the first day, for chrissakes.
Have a seat over there.

450
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:05,424
One of you is gonna tell me
what the hell happened.

451
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:09,052
I'll tell you what happened. I'm walking
to class, minding my own business.

452
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,762
This psycho kid, he just jumped me.

453
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:14,016
Jared, stop lying.
That boy is half your size.

454
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,560
Okay, yeah. He tackled me out of nowhere!

455
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:17,936
It's messed up.

456
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:19,771
Is that a fact?

457
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,942
Speak already.
Tell him what he did or I will.

458
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,110
I don't snitch.

459
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,987
-What?
-Hey, hey, hey!

460
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,322
English, please.

461
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,991
I'm trying to get him to talk,
but he won't say what happened.

462
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:31,909
Oh, really?

463
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,661
Boy, what happened?

464
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:40,417
He called me a Mexican hobbit.
I'm not even Mexican.

465
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,045
Jared.

466
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,255
Get your ass out in that hall.

467
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:47,716
Okay, all right, Big Dog.

468
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,927
Call me "Big Dog" again
and watch what happens.

469
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,221
Get in the hall!

470
00:41:56,058 --> 00:42:00,312
Kids like Jared feel threatened by anyone
they can't relate to, you understand?

471
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:01,396
Just avoid him.

472
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,358
What if he attacks Mateo again?

473
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,402
Speak to a teacher
before you start throwing hands.

474
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:10,489
Or the next time, school police
will escort you out for assault,

475
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:11,490
you understand?

476
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,535
I'm gonna talk
to the principal about Jared.

477
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,954
But you two have detention.

478
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,542
-We're being detained?
-No, no. No.

479
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,502
Detention is not detained.

480
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,631
No. Listen, it's not that bad, bro.

481
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,384
<i>What's the excuse now, huh?</i>

482
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,096
What happened, Mateo?

483
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:37,766
Answer your father!

484
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:41,854
Teo, tell them already.

485
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:43,772
Were you provoked?

486
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:48,861
Why's your eye like that?

487
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,116
He was getting beat up.
I had to save his ass.

488
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,785
You couldn't break up the fight
like a civilized person?

489
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:58,829
Is that what I've taught you?

490
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,748
No. No way!
You're not gonna pin this shit on me!

491
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,501
I'm not gonna be part
of this "lifting each other up" bullshit

492
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,295
and then pay for the damages.

493
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:07,588
This is on you, Dad.

494
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:11,008
You need to straighten him out
before he really fucks up.

495
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:13,427
Who does he think he is?

496
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:17,931
Come here.

497
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:19,892
Carlos Andrés.

498
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,728
Carlos Andrés. Come here. Come here.

499
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,229
Don't you close that door on me!

500
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,190
-Open the door!
-Calm down.

501
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:29,067
-Get the hell out of my room!
-Your room?

502
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:33,322
Is that why we brought you here?
So that you could turn into a wild animal?

503
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:36,325
Focus on what you need to do, tough guy.

504
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:39,203
You wanna work at NASA or paint houses?

505
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:43,165
Because if you wanna paint houses,
you've got the job!

506
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,543
I could use the help.

507
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,891
How could you let them
get out of hand like this?

508
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,601
No, no, no. Wait a second.

509
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:06,939
You abandoned us for half a year
and now you have the nerve to blame me?

510
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,106
I abandoned you?

511
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:12,277
Did I leave by choice?
No! I could have been killed!

512
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:19,303
<i>Hello?</i>

513
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:22,222
Happy birthday, dawg.
What's good, my dude?

514
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,601
<i>Teo, what do you want?</i>

515
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,770
Dude, you're still upset? What's up?

516
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:34,234
<i>Yeah, well, the Bethancourts showed up
at my crib with the pigs.</i>

517
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,404
<i>The old bitch at the corner store
saw us running away</i>

518
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,907
<i>and told them that I had blown up
their fucking dollhouse.</i>

519
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,325
Shit, man.

520
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:45,037
Well, you can tell the pigs
to come get me now.

521
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:51,793
<i>Fuck you, man! Didn't you hear me?
I'm in deep shit because of you!</i>

522
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:53,545
Why? What happened? Tell me.

523
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:57,007
<i>My old man's not gonna buy me
out of the army anymore.</i>

524
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,511
<i>He's making me serve
with the fucking Lanceros!</i>

525
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,513
<i>The anti-guerilla squad.</i>

526
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:06,558
No way, dude.
Your old man wouldn't do that to you.

527
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:10,312
<i>The fuck do you know
about my dad, asshole!</i>

528
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:12,481
<i>If I get killed in the jungle,
it's your fault!</i>

529
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:15,442
Hey!

530
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:18,111
Norby! Hello?

531
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:18,922
Sorry I'm late.

532
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,551
Three hundred seniors and only one of me.

533
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:30,058
I looked at your record, and you're one
of the easier ones, huh, Carlos?

534
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:35,772
Not quite, Ms. Johnson.
I still need money to pay for college.

535
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,525
-You applied to schools already?
-No.

536
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,486
But I am going to be applying
to the Georgia Aerospace Institute

537
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,030
in October for early admissions.

538
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,823
What, Engineering?

539
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:46,325
I'm gonna work at NASA.

540
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:50,537
-You have a backup plan?
-No.

541
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:55,209
You shouldn't put all your eggs
in one basket. It's an expensive school.

542
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:58,003
-I'm working on a satellite.
-A satellite?

543
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,672
It's just a prototype,
but the concept could generate interest

544
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:02,216
from the Aerospace Institute.

545
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:03,300
Yeah, sure.

546
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:08,180
Are your immigration documents in order?
Your transcripts are Colombian.

547
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:09,848
I'm on a tourist visa right now.

548
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:12,851
But our lawyer is taking care
of our political asylum papers.

549
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,523
You shouldn't have any trouble
applying to a school

550
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:19,274
without your papers for now.

551
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:23,862
Yes, but what about the scholarships,
Mrs. Johnson? How do I apply?

552
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,532
Fill out this paperwork
with your parents to get started.

553
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:28,659
Make an appointment to come back

554
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:30,911
and we'll go through
all the available awards.

555
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:32,454
I look forward to it.

556
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:37,042
"Why?" It's the whole prompt.
Who the hell came up with that?

557
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:38,919
It's a trick question.

558
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:41,129
You should just write, "Why the fuck not?"

559
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:43,715
-Yeah, I don't think so.
-What are you gonna write?

560
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:47,344
That I've always wanted
to work with the best of the best

561
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,429
at the forefront of technology.

562
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:51,139
It's so cliché.

563
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:55,352
That's why I'm telling them
what happened to us in Colombia

564
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,354
and how my success
in the sciences could prove

565
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,398
that we're not all Pablo Escobar types.

566
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:02,192
So heavy-handed, dude.
Good luck with that.

567
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,532
That's why I have to write it
so it doesn't come off that way.

568
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:09,449
Right.

569
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:14,621
-What happened in Colombia anyway?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

570
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:15,956
<i>You're late.</i>

571
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:22,462
Have a seat anywhere.
No homework. No reading allowed.

572
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:31,013
What the hell?

573
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:35,392
-Now you're smoking in school?
-We're in detention.

574
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:42,274
-Excuse me, sir.
-No bathroom breaks allowed.

575
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:46,069
No, he keeps talking to me.
I don't want to get more in trouble.

576
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:48,614
Mop Top, wanna be with me tomorrow?

577
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,824
Move over there.

578
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,629
What the hell's your deal, man?

579
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:06,173
Why do you take it out on me
like everything's my fault?

580
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:09,801
-You really don't get it, do you?
-No, I don't. Explain.

581
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:14,181
You think anyone cared to ask me
where I wanted to move?

582
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:18,810
No. It's like I don't count for shit
in this family. I'm sick of it.

583
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,438
You're so damn selfish.

584
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:24,900
The right decisions were made,
so deal with it.

585
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:29,905
If you're so sick of getting dragged
into things, start figuring out a plan.

586
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:32,824
But as long as we're living
with our parents, we're at their mercy.

587
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:34,910
Simple as that.

588
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:35,869
Grow up.

589
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:40,958
I'm gonna go check out
the Aerospace Institute. Tell Mom.

590
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:59,893
Cosmobot was designed to mimic
the articulations of a human hand,

591
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:03,814
making it the perfect aide
for complex spacewalk operations.

592
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:09,069
Now, this machine is highly functional,
but as you can see,

593
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,406
it still relies heavily
on a human operator.

594
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,869
NASA is working on giving it
human-like sight and recognition,

595
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:19,162
but that poses the following problem.

596
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:24,251
With infinitely variable configurations
of definite shapes,

597
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:27,296
how do we go about
optimizing computer vision?

598
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:29,423
Anyone?

599
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,555
Yes. Yes, you in the back.

600
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:45,063
The way I see it, we should...

601
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,025
We should teach computers
to see the same way

602
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,776
a child learns to recognize the world.

603
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:54,573
What I mean is, with parental training,
a baby processes billions of images

604
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:57,659
before they start interpreting things
they see as they grow up, right?

605
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:00,120
That's what we should do with computers.

606
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,122
If we manually populate a data model

607
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,374
with a massive amount
of visual information,

608
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:07,336
objects, shapes, actions,
functions, you name it,

609
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:09,922
and define what each
of those visual cues are,

610
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,715
we could build an algorithm

611
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,176
that would end up teaching itself
in an open-ended cycle.

612
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:15,802
That's pretty ambitious.

613
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:20,182
But the benefits could offset
the initial cost.

614
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:22,851
You should do more research.

615
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:28,023
In a decade or so, we may have
the technology to implement that idea.

616
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:33,237
Okay, so let's talk about
the practical aspects of robotics.

617
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,531
How do we see the applications

618
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:37,658
of something like the cosmobot
in everyday life?

619
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,621
-Dr. Onitsuka, have a minute?
-That was a compelling solution in there.

620
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:45,707
Thank you, sir. My name is
Carlos Restrepo. It's nice to meet you.

621
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:46,792
Pleasure, Carlos.

622
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:51,338
Restrepo? I don't recall seeing
that name on the register.

623
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,841
I'm not registered,
but I've been looking forward

624
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:55,968
to taking
your human machine systems class.

625
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:58,470
I was wondering if I could audit
for the rest of this semester.

626
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:01,056
Are you a student here?

627
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,809
Yes, first semester.

628
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:08,438
Okay, sure. You're welcome any time.

629
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:11,733
Office hours are posted online.
I'll let the T.A. know you'll be joining.

630
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:12,734
Thank you, sir!

631
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:22,786
<i>Dude, it sucks that we left off
the way we did.</i>

632
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:27,624
<i>I didn't realize I fucked up so badly.</i>

633
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:31,628
<i>I felt like shit when you hung up on me.</i>

634
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,047
<i>I can't blame you for that,</i>

635
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:39,261
<i>and I completely accept
that what I did before I left was wrong.</i>

636
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:42,097
<i>And I want to ask you
to please forgive me.</i>

637
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,934
<i>I don't know what I'd do if you got
killed over there because of me.</i>

638
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:50,230
<i>Your homey for life, Teo.</i>

639
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:01,575
-Ma! You're not gonna believe it!
-What?

640
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:04,161
-Dad's still at work?
-Yeah.

641
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,914
I never see him anymore.

642
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:09,958
-Yeah. How did it go? Tell me.
-It was awesome, Ma.

643
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:14,129
I walked right into a class with this guy,
Dr. Onitsuka, who's an actual astronaut.

644
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:17,966
Really? They have that level
of people teaching there?

645
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,178
And guess what.
I can go back whenever I want.

646
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:24,890
Just to observe.
But still freaking cool, huh?

647
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:28,852
That's great, sweetie! How exciting!
See how doors are opening for you?

648
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:31,146
"See how doors are opening for you?"

649
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:32,856
Idiot.

650
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:30,163
Hi, Mafe.

651
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:31,707
It's good to see you.

652
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:35,961
<i>Hey, Carly, it's good to see you too.
What are you working on, your satellite?</i>

653
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:40,591
No. I'm actually writing my essay
for the Aerospace Institute application.

654
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,009
<i>How's it coming along?</i>

655
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:44,094
It sucks.

656
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:47,556
-Feel like I'm not gonna get in.
<i>-Yeah, right. Of course you will.</i>

657
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,057
You really think so?

658
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:50,475
<i>I know so.</i>

659
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:55,981
<i>But I really need to talk to you
about something, Carly.</i>

660
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:57,608
What?

661
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:02,696
<i>David and I have been hanging out a lot,</i>

662
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:04,781
<i>and...</i>

663
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:09,328
<i>he asked me out on a date. I wanna go.</i>

664
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:13,498
El Chuleta?

665
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:21,340
<i>-Yeah, well, you never said anything, so--
</i>-No, yeah, whatever. I have to go.

666
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,299
<i>You better buy me another one.</i>

667
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,343
<i>My turn to eat shit.</i>

668
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,210
<i>Wave to the camera.</i>

669
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:00,355
Mom!

670
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:07,362
Nelly!

671
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,417
Where the fuck is my Emperor shirt?

672
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:25,255
Okay, here we go.

673
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:28,800
You're gonna eat shit!

674
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:33,764
Yo, are you good?

675
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:39,102
It's not funny, dude.
This is my brother's shirt.

676
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:43,524
-He's gonna flip his shit.
-Just toss it and say you haven't seen it.

677
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:22,771
I don't know if this is a good time.

678
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,650
It's a little corny,
but I made that for you.

679
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:37,452
You don't like it?

680
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:41,248
Kidding me? I love it. It's totally you.

681
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:43,250
Thank you.

682
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:59,433
Look who's out of the cave.

683
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:03,979
Stay out of it.

684
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:13,614
I told you a thousand times
not to touch my shit, fucking Smurf!

685
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:22,873
You ripped it, asshole!

686
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,709
Leave him alone. It's just a stupid shirt!

687
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:32,132
You okay?

688
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:38,323
Teo?

689
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:42,744
Teíto.

690
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:44,288
Get lost.

691
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:49,626
Bro, I'm sorry for humiliating you
like that. I really messed up.

692
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:54,423
Just give me back my aguardiente
and fuck off, animal.

693
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:59,636
Fine, if you don't wanna forgive me.

694
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:03,974
But I'm keeping the booze until you pay
for my solar panels and my shirt.

695
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:07,144
Be grateful I didn't take your money.

696
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:13,942
Look what came in the mail for you.

697
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:43,680
<i>Teo!</i>

698
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:47,017
<i>Thanks for saying all those corny things.</i>

699
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,313
<i>It was a kind gesture that made me
realize what's really important.</i>

700
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:54,233
<i>You're like a brother to me
and always will be.</i>

701
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:59,696
<i>What I didn't expect is that
the fucking Lanceros are awesome, dude.</i>

702
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,573
<i>I'm having such a blast!</i>

703
01:03:02,324 --> 01:03:05,661
<i>Honestly, how else would I realize
what I'm made of</i>

704
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,246
<i>without going through this shit?</i>

705
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:08,205
<i>Norby.</i>

706
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,635
Excuse me, Dr. Onitsuka.

707
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:26,014
Can I get your impressions
on a project I've been working on?

708
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,141
Sure. Come on in.

709
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:31,311
Okay. I'm designing a satellite.

710
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:33,146
May I?

711
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:35,440
Be my guest.

712
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:39,945
Okay, so I was doing some research
on anthropogenic space weather,

713
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:41,947
and I came up with a hypothesis.

714
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:46,910
So it's a known fact that man-made
power line harmonic radiation exists

715
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,036
in the magnetosphere.

716
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,788
-Yes?
-Agreed.

717
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:54,168
So what I'm proposing is that very low
frequencies from communication devices

718
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:57,129
and military and scientific experiments
around the world are

719
01:03:57,212 --> 01:04:00,340
and have been creating a sort
of protective bubble around the Earth.

720
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:02,426
Let me show you.

721
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:04,261
This is the Van Allen belt...

722
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:08,932
where high-energy
solar wind particles concentrate.

723
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:14,897
I want to prove that these particles are
interacting with man-made VLF harmonics.

724
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:19,109
If we can somehow launch my satellite
into this precise area--

725
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,862
Everybody wants
to launch stuff into space.

726
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:24,448
We're gonna have a problem
with space junk in the future.

727
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:28,202
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

728
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,663
The probe will take measurements
to determine the rate of expansion

729
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:33,540
of the bubble, if it actually exists.

730
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:39,213
This thing could protect future satellites
from harmful space radiation,

731
01:04:39,296 --> 01:04:42,549
as well as draw further insights
into space weather forecasts

732
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:44,676
for optimum launch conditions.

733
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,346
It could actually achieve
the opposite of what you said, sir.

734
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:49,431
It could save NASA a ton of money.

735
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,520
-Do you mind?
-Sure. Use the laptop.

736
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:55,604
Okay.

737
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:58,357
I had to teach myself
advanced mathematics and programming

738
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,902
to get the software to where it's at,
but I still need help refining it.

739
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:07,783
I'm also building a prototype
of the hardware, but it's not complete.

740
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:14,915
Okay.

741
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:20,295
Yeah, you're not accounting for
the variable gravitational acceleration.

742
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:21,755
At this speed and altitude,

743
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,424
any minute fluctuation would send
your probe out of orbit.

744
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:30,389
Man, I'm so stupid. Of course
it's not negligible. I should have known.

745
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,474
No, no, don't beat yourself up.

746
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:35,269
If this bubble is real,
this could be a groundbreaking idea.

747
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:40,649
Would you mind if I shared this
with my colleagues at NASA?

748
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,820
You think they'd be interested in this?

749
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:47,197
If it saves them money,
I'm sure they would be.

750
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:48,782
Can I hold on to that CD?

751
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,576
-Absolutely. Yes.
-All right.

752
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:54,580
Let me get in touch with colleagues,
and I'll circle back with you.

753
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:55,497
How's that sound?

754
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:58,333
That sounds amazing. Thank you.

755
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:01,837
-Nice work.
-Thank you.

756
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:27,506
God, please let them accept me.

757
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:29,007
Please, please.

758
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:31,885
<i>You really drew all these?</i>

759
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:32,803
Yeah.

760
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:36,056
This is cool.

761
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:41,186
In Colombia, when a person has
a big dick, we call it a third leg.

762
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:44,982
This shit is hilarious, yo.

763
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:46,817
You're so freaking talented.

764
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:50,070
-It's wild.
-Can I show you something?

765
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:50,988
Yeah.

766
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:53,991
So I've been working with my old man

767
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:56,869
and I almost have
enough money to buy a car.

768
01:07:57,744 --> 01:07:58,871
-Really?
-Yeah.

769
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:01,498
-We about to be cruising?
-You coming? I'm going to New York.

770
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:03,709
I'm leaving this shithole forever.

771
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:06,003
You already know I'm down.

772
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:10,340
Well, let's see if you like my music
'cause that's a long trip, you know?

773
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:24,104
Work it, babe.

774
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:28,024
Should we dance?

775
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,740
This how we do it, <i>el perreo.</i>

776
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:37,826
Hey!

777
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,666
This how we do it in Atlanta, baby.

778
01:08:45,626 --> 01:08:47,336
I'm learning, I'm learning.

779
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:47,229
Good evening, everybody.

780
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:55,279
Let's talk outside.

781
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:58,907
-You have news about NASA?
-Grab your things.

782
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:08,709
I'm sorry, but you're no longer allowed
to audit my class.

783
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:10,460
What? Why?

784
01:10:10,544 --> 01:10:11,962
Because you lied to me.

785
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:14,756
My T.A. looked you up.
You're not even a student here, are you?

786
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,009
-No, doctor, I can explain.
-You know what?

787
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:20,762
I'm really disappointed in you.
Were you trying to cheat the system?

788
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:22,806
-No, sir, I would never--
-Save it.

789
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:28,270
I value honesty above all else,
and you breached my trust.

790
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,190
Good night.

791
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:42,784
Hello.

792
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:45,537
What? When?

793
01:10:47,206 --> 01:10:49,082
What the hell does that mean, Ernesto?

794
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,753
Wait, wait, wait.

795
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:54,296
Wait...

796
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:57,299
What do I have to do?

797
01:10:58,842 --> 01:10:59,843
Where's that?

798
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:03,805
Yeah, they're here.

799
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:07,392
-How am I supposed to tell them?
-What's going on?

800
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:09,686
He's getting deported.

801
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:11,688
Who?

802
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:13,106
Your dad.

803
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:16,818
Yeah, I'm still here.

804
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:28,830
He got arrested?

805
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,085
Says here they're denying all his cases.

806
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:36,547
Faces charges for fabrication of evidence.

807
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,924
But our evidence is legitimate.

808
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:44,346
It says here there's a ten-year penalty
for deportation if we overstay.

809
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,349
This can't be happening.

810
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:51,854
He swindled us, Mom.
He's a motherfucking crook!

811
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:57,109
According to this shit,
all his clients are under investigation.

812
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:01,321
-Motions for deportations have been set.
-Let's just go back.

813
01:12:01,405 --> 01:12:03,365
What else is there to do here?

814
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:06,827
Look for another lawyer,
someone who can fix this mess.

815
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,580
Maybe there's something
we can still do for the three of us.

816
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:11,665
So we're just gonna
let Dad go back by himself?

817
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:14,877
What if he gets targeted again?
Did you forget about that minor detail?

818
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,170
What can we do about that?

819
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:19,131
You wanna go face up
to those guys or what?

820
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:22,176
Let's sell this crib
and pay the extortion money,

821
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:23,886
like we should have a long time ago.

822
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:28,056
We can move to a different part
of Bogotá, lay low.

823
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,809
I don't know.

824
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:35,272
What I do know is,
there's no way I'm staying here.

825
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:37,024
I've had enough.

826
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:40,569
I'm not going anywhere, Ma.
We can figure this out.

827
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:42,362
Please, don't listen to Carlotta.

828
01:12:42,446 --> 01:12:45,532
We gotta stick together.
That's what Dad always says.

829
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:47,868
I don't know.

830
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,787
You guys go back if you want.

831
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:54,958
What about the Aerospace Institute?

832
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:57,753
How the hell am I gonna do
my thing over there?

833
01:12:57,836 --> 01:13:02,216
This guy, Mom...
Quit it with that fucking Aerospace.

834
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:05,219
Teo, let's not rush into anything.

835
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:09,515
Don't lose your head.
Your dad's gonna call soon.

836
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,683
We'll discuss as a family, all right?

837
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:15,979
Discuss? Mom, listen to me
for once in your life!

838
01:13:17,356 --> 01:13:19,900
It makes no sense
for us to stay here as illegals.

839
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:22,736
So it makes more sense for us
to go back to a country at war?

840
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:24,863
Do you really want
to be forced into the army?

841
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:27,241
If we pay that fucking extortion money,

842
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:29,660
there's not gonna be enough left
to buy us out.

843
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:31,954
I could give a shit
if I get drafted into the army

844
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:33,580
or if I have to repeat senior year.

845
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:36,291
If that's what we have to do
as Colombians, then that's that!

846
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:40,879
I'm no chickenshit! Even Norby
joined the anti-guerrilla squad.

847
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:45,801
If millions of Colombians live
with this violence, why can't we?

848
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:48,220
Do you honestly think this is better?

849
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:56,019
I don't wanna leave the country.
It's not an option for me.

850
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,147
I can't give you legal advice.

851
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:03,151
And as far as the education goes,
should you become undocumented...

852
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:04,695
What are my options?

853
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:08,824
Private vocational, technical schools.

854
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:12,578
You can build different skills
while you're working on your visa.

855
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:18,333
Trade school? Are you kidding me?
You want me to be a fucking mechanic?

856
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:20,335
Of course not, Carly.

857
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:23,088
But without your papers,

858
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:26,717
unless you can pay out-of-state tuition
out of pocket, you...

859
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:28,969
Carly.

860
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:31,930
Carly!

861
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:25,734
<i>Everyone is gathered here,</i>

862
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:28,737
<i>they all have their crazy flair
and big smiles.</i>

863
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,822
<i>They're all just happy to be here.</i>

864
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:35,577
<i>And as the year 1999 gives way for 2000,</i>

865
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:40,374
<i>we celebrate a truly memorable night here
in Times Square, New York City,</i>

866
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:42,125
<i>the city that never sleeps.</i>

867
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:45,087
Mom, there's a party tonight.

868
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:47,881
You're not going out tonight. No, sir.

869
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:48,799
Why not?

870
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:54,513
Because I've got enough trouble as it is
and I don't want you looking for more.

871
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:56,765
So you're just gonna lock me up in here?

872
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:58,016
No, no, no.

873
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,184
What if he tags along?

874
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:02,437
No, thanks.

875
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:06,692
I'm gonna wait for Dad to call.

876
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:11,822
He would've called by now, sweetie.
I bet all the lines are busy.

877
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:14,408
Don't stress out, Mom.

878
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:19,079
I can't stand these walls anymore.
I'm going apeshit here.

879
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:25,252
<i>And we're starting
our countdown from here on</i>

880
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:30,632
<i>as we approach the end of the millennium
and we usher in a new one in 20 seconds.</i>

881
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:34,678
<i>Oh, you're in for a spectacular night
of celebration...</i>

882
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:36,471
You go together or not at all.

883
01:16:37,556 --> 01:16:38,432
<i>This is it.</i>

884
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,684
You can talk to your dad tomorrow.

885
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:43,937
But I warn you,
not a single sip. I'll know.

886
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:49,193
<i>...five, four, three, two, one.</i>

887
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:51,069
<i>Happy 2000!</i>

888
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:53,280
All right, my loves.

889
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:56,950
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

890
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:00,537
I love you both so much.

891
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:05,250
I hope 2000 brings us
a lot of good things. I love you.

892
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:08,295
I love you too, Mom.

893
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,338
Go on.

894
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,215
All right, Carlotta, let's go.

895
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:14,885
Be careful!

896
01:17:32,236 --> 01:17:33,612
This dude blacked out.

897
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:40,536
-I'm getting a soda.
-Cool.

898
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:48,335
Yo, dawg.

899
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:50,587
Teo?

900
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:55,801
Teo! Oh, it's so good to see you!

901
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:58,971
Are you having a good time?

902
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,808
Oh, your accent's so sexy.
Has it always been like that?

903
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:04,893
-Let's get you drunk.
-Okay.

904
01:18:04,977 --> 01:18:05,936
Come on!

905
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:10,399
Yo, let's go, let's go. Beer bong!

906
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,214
I don't drink.

907
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:37,092
We just survived the apocalypse, dude.
You have to drink with me.

908
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:40,721
-You're clearly drunk.
-You clearly sound like my dad.

909
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:44,141
Come on, live a little.
Loosen up. Come on.

910
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:06,914
Don't let it burn out.

911
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:36,068
Life is so crazy, dude.

912
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,698
You know how all atoms are made
of energy, right?

913
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:44,284
-No shit.
-No, I'm serious.

914
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:49,706
Like, energy can't be created
or destroyed, it's just always been.

915
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:53,627
That means we're made from the same energy
that was released in the beginning, right?

916
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:57,214
That would literally make us
as old as the big bang.

917
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,264
You're so fucking hot.

918
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:53,478
Wait. Sage.

919
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:54,688
-Wait? Wait?
-Wait.

920
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:57,316
-We're fucked up. We're fucked up.
-No.

921
01:20:59,109 --> 01:20:59,943
Shit!

922
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,700
<i>Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!</i>

923
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:11,705
<i>You wanna work at NASA or paint houses?</i>

924
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:13,957
<i>I value honesty above all else.</i>

925
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:14,875
<i>Go home!</i>

926
01:21:15,459 --> 01:21:16,710
<i>He's getting deported.</i>

927
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:20,255
<i>What else is there to do here?</i>

928
01:21:20,923 --> 01:21:22,674
<i>That's so cliché.</i>

929
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,636
I'm sorry, I'm tripping out really bad.

930
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:29,139
-You fucking serious?
-I have to go. I'm sorry.

931
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:42,277
-The hell were you doing?
-I was holding her hair. She had to puke.

932
01:21:42,361 --> 01:21:45,489
-Bullshit! I saw you two go in there!
-It's true, I threw up.

933
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:48,158
Think I don't know what you were doing?
Making out or fucking?

934
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:52,037
-The fuck is wrong with you? She's drunk!
-What the fuck, bro?

935
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,914
I was helping her! Tell them, Sage.

936
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:57,835
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

937
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,635
Holy shit, dude.

938
01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:11,515
It's my pet Chihuahua!

939
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:14,643
Here, boy. Here, boy.

940
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:16,478
<i>Yo quiero</i> Taco Bell.

941
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:19,022
<i>Yo quiero</i> my Taco Bell, bitch.

942
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,195
Speedy-- Speedy Gonzales!

943
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:26,905
-Speedy Gonzales!
-What is he doing?

944
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:30,117
-What the fuck?
-Oh, shit!

945
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,702
What the fuck?

946
01:22:31,785 --> 01:22:34,413
That's my car! Man, what the fuck?

947
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:40,502
Fuck! Call the cops, yo!
Someone fucking call...

948
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:45,674
Fucking... Anybody see this shit?

949
01:22:45,757 --> 01:22:47,050
That's my car, man!

950
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:55,184
Fuck!

951
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:00,731
The cops!

952
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:03,567
The cops are coming!

953
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:06,445
Teo!

954
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:11,950
Teo!

955
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:38,977
Please, Mr. Kahn,
I will pay to you to fix the car.

956
01:23:39,478 --> 01:23:42,397
Please, don't press charges.

957
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:45,984
We are in immigration process. So sorry.

958
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:48,820
No, Dad, press charges!
The kid's a psycho.

959
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:51,740
Mr. Kahn, please, just let us pay you.

960
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:53,450
You wanna settle, Mr. Kahn?

961
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:56,370
Well, officer, these are our terms.

962
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:59,373
I'll agree not to press charges...

963
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:05,504
on the condition that you pay my son
$15,000 for the property damages.

964
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:08,632
Did he say $15,000?

965
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:13,428
-Yeah, Mom. We have to.
-What do you mean?

966
01:24:13,512 --> 01:24:15,931
Otherwise, we're screwed.
This guy's a lawyer.

967
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:18,809
Dear God.

968
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:23,605
Okay.

969
01:24:25,232 --> 01:24:27,317
You can make it out to Jared Kahn.

970
01:24:30,612 --> 01:24:32,281
<i>Irresponsible!</i>

971
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:35,576
-Inconsiderate!
-Me? Inconsiderate? What about him?

972
01:24:35,659 --> 01:24:37,661
He's the one
who dragged us into this shit!

973
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:39,454
-None of this was my idea!
-Shut up!

974
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:44,209
You're so hell-bent
on this stupid fucking NASA illusion.

975
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:46,044
Grow up!

976
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:49,882
You convinced yourself
that you're better than everyone,

977
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:51,925
that you're hot shit, but you're a nobody!

978
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:55,721
You're the nobody!
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!

979
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:58,515
Shut up! Both of you!
This is the last straw.

980
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:01,894
That money's coming out
of your college savings account.

981
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:06,356
And, Mateo, you're gonna give me
all the money you've earned with your dad.

982
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:08,525
You're not gonna bully me!

983
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,905
Pack all your things.
We're going back to Colombia.

984
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:17,409
I'm selling the house
and paying the fucking extortion money.

985
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:18,535
It's over!

986
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:46,230
<i>...like such major competition.</i>

987
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:48,857
<i>Personally, I would have picked
Lauryn Hill or Madonna.</i>

988
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:50,609
<i>But it would be such an honor.</i>

989
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:55,572
<i>I've been working for a really long time,
though, for my success and everything.</i>

990
01:25:55,656 --> 01:25:59,243
<i>But it's totally paid off,
being able to come to places like this.</i>

991
01:27:55,734 --> 01:27:57,569
Sorry, Mom. I fucked us over.

992
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:51,039
Sweetie, look what came for you.

993
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:07,014
So... I got in.

994
01:29:14,438 --> 01:29:16,481
Hang on. So what now?

995
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:18,150
Nothing, Teo.

996
01:29:20,152 --> 01:29:21,320
Nothing changes.

997
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:23,864
Nothing changes, my ass.

998
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:27,618
They're offering you a spot.

999
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:30,954
There must be something you can do.
Go talk to them.

1000
01:29:31,705 --> 01:29:32,539
Do it.

1001
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:32,432
Make it so that it expands outwards.

1002
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:36,728
I'm ready, Teo.

1003
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:38,897
Hit it.

1004
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:46,613
So dope!

1005
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:52,744
You did it. Well, we did it. I helped you.

1006
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:03,380
Excuse me, sir.

1007
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:10,012
I came to apologize for breaking
your trust. I have no excuse.

1008
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:12,222
I messed up bigtime, and...

1009
01:31:14,766 --> 01:31:16,393
Ever since I can remember,

1010
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:21,398
coming here, working at NASA,
it's everything to me, sir.

1011
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:24,568
And still you thought
that lying was the best way to get there?

1012
01:31:25,861 --> 01:31:29,239
The people in this field need
to be forthright and dependable.

1013
01:31:29,323 --> 01:31:30,449
Lives are at stake.

1014
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:32,701
I recognize I made a huge mistake.

1015
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:36,038
Okay, I wanna be transparent with you.

1016
01:31:37,414 --> 01:31:40,584
My immigration papers were screwed up
by a crooked immigration lawyer.

1017
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,671
That's unfortunate.

1018
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:48,509
It means I can't go here,
even if I've been accepted.

1019
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:51,303
Ever since I went into space,

1020
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:55,557
the whole concept of borders stopped
making any sense to me whatsoever.

1021
01:31:58,894 --> 01:32:00,145
What are you gonna do now?

1022
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:03,357
My only hope is to get
an Extraordinary Abilities visa

1023
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,401
so I could stay
and afford tuition as an in-state student.

1024
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:08,028
I see.

1025
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:12,533
Is there any way you can still make
those calls you promised for my project?

1026
01:32:13,492 --> 01:32:17,037
The only way I can get that visa is
if NASA sponsors me and the R&D.

1027
01:32:18,288 --> 01:32:21,625
It's one thing for you to apologize,
which I appreciate,

1028
01:32:22,334 --> 01:32:24,711
but how can I trust
you're not gonna let me down again?

1029
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:29,299
Just give me another chance, sir.

1030
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,055
It's my reputation on the line.

1031
01:32:39,059 --> 01:32:40,060
I understand.

1032
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:43,230
Thank you for your time.

1033
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:53,156
ONE MONTH LATER

1034
01:33:11,675 --> 01:33:13,760
My little bird is leaving the nest.

1035
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:17,389
Promise me
you'll take good care of yourself?

1036
01:33:17,472 --> 01:33:20,142
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll figure something out.

1037
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:21,727
I'm gonna miss you.

1038
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,353
-Love you.
-Me too.

1039
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:29,443
Tell the old man I miss him.

1040
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:30,611
Of course, bro.

1041
01:33:31,195 --> 01:33:35,032
You killed those graphics.
Thanks for helping me out.

1042
01:33:35,115 --> 01:33:36,241
All good.

1043
01:33:36,325 --> 01:33:39,369
Listen. Give this to Mafe for me, please?

1044
01:33:40,037 --> 01:33:41,580
Sure thing.

1045
01:33:42,289 --> 01:33:43,874
-I love you.
-I love you.

1046
01:34:21,828 --> 01:34:24,039
<i>Hi, Carlos. This is Dr. Onitsuka.</i>

1047
01:34:24,665 --> 01:34:27,000
<i>I'm calling because
I actually passed on your idea</i>

1048
01:34:27,084 --> 01:34:29,169
<i>to a colleague at the Heliophysics Lab.</i>

1049
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:32,756
<i>He's intrigued. He wants to know
if you'd like to come into my office</i>

1050
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,050
<i>and meet with him next Tuesday.</i>

1051
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:37,803
<i>Is that good with you?
Let me know. Thanks.</i>

1052
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:42,850
Man!

1053
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:02,244
Nervous?

1054
01:35:03,245 --> 01:35:07,583
It's okay. They've already gone over
the dossier, so just keep it concise.

1055
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:10,627
Be sure to wrap things up
with the project's practical applications.

1056
01:35:11,837 --> 01:35:14,381
All right.
You're gonna be great. Let's go.

1057
01:35:17,718 --> 01:35:20,596
The probe right in front of you
is designed to confirm my hypothesis

1058
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:23,515
that man-made VLFs are creating
a protective bubble

1059
01:35:23,599 --> 01:35:25,350
that is expanding around our planet.

1060
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:28,187
I've uploaded
a data system simulation into the probe

1061
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:31,607
to show how our software will interpret
the data of the alleged expansion.

1062
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:33,108
Let me demonstrate.

1063
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:43,785
Can you run
the altitude control simultaneously?

1064
01:35:47,372 --> 01:35:48,624
It will be sluggish.

1065
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:53,003
I'm working on updating the processor,
but I'll give it a try.

1066
01:36:31,124 --> 01:36:33,210
I can see how you were impressed, Mike.

1067
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:34,837
But I was under the impression

1068
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,756
that this project wasn't
in such a precarious stage.

1069
01:36:39,049 --> 01:36:40,843
Carlos, give us a couple of minutes?

1070
01:36:40,926 --> 01:36:44,221
-I can reboot it and run it again, sir.
-Thank you very much, young man.

1071
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:06,034
So they passed on your project.

1072
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:07,703
They had a tight window.

1073
01:37:08,537 --> 01:37:10,080
We could try again next year.

1074
01:37:10,163 --> 01:37:11,498
No, I can't!

1075
01:37:16,503 --> 01:37:18,463
Carlos, don't do anything rash. Carlos--

1076
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:22,009
With all due respect, sir, I don't think
you're seeing the big picture here.

1077
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:25,679
There's so many applications
for the data we can generate with this.

1078
01:37:25,762 --> 01:37:27,723
It could protect
your instruments up there.

1079
01:37:27,806 --> 01:37:31,101
It could also revolutionize
telecommunications, the energy sector

1080
01:37:31,185 --> 01:37:34,188
and private aerospace transportation
in just a few years.

1081
01:37:35,731 --> 01:37:37,608
I know the probe still needs work,

1082
01:37:38,192 --> 01:37:40,736
but an experiment like this
has never been thought of before.

1083
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:44,865
Wouldn't you wanna know
if the bubble exists?

1084
01:37:44,948 --> 01:37:47,576
Few people get to answer
an enigma like this, sir.

1085
01:37:48,368 --> 01:37:50,495
And we can be the ones to do exactly that.

1086
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:54,917
I need your backing
so that I can stay in the States

1087
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,503
and set up this project
here at the Aerospace Institute.

1088
01:37:58,212 --> 01:38:01,465
Is there any way we could please
figure out a work-study situation

1089
01:38:01,548 --> 01:38:03,383
in where I could
keep developing the probe?

1090
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:05,802
I can work closely with Dr. Onitsuka.

1091
01:38:10,641 --> 01:38:11,975
What do you say, Mike?

1092
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:25,864
We're coming up, sweetie!

1093
01:38:27,282 --> 01:38:29,785
-Do you need help?
-No, it's okay.

1094
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:32,871
Okay, watch your step.

1095
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:38,001
-Careful not to scratch it.
-Scratch what?

1096
01:38:38,085 --> 01:38:41,338
-And watch my stairs!
-Turn it. There you go.

1097
01:38:41,421 --> 01:38:42,840
That's it. Careful, Teo.

1098
01:38:44,007 --> 01:38:46,385
That's good. Turn it right there.

1099
01:38:47,636 --> 01:38:48,679
Good, good.

1100
01:38:49,429 --> 01:38:50,389
Here, here.

1101
01:38:52,808 --> 01:38:53,892
Down.

1102
01:38:55,519 --> 01:38:57,354
That's it.

1103
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:01,149
-Here, sweetie.
-Thanks, Mom.

1104
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:09,616
We should send Carly
some pictures of the apartment.

1105
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,577
Yes. Good idea, honey.

1106
01:39:13,704 --> 01:39:17,541
<i>The Lanceros Academy demands
that all of its members</i>

1107
01:39:17,624 --> 01:39:22,045
must be in perfect physical
and psychological conditions.

1108
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:27,759
Only those who withstand
the elite training will be accepted.

1109
01:39:29,261 --> 01:39:32,014
Only a select few-- Listen carefully.

1110
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,766
Only a select few will earn the privilege

1111
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:39,188
of becoming an honorable Lancero
of the National Army of Colombia.

1112
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:44,693
If any of you believe
that you have these virtues

1113
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:50,449
and the valor to gain
an invaluable education in leadership,

1114
01:39:51,033 --> 01:39:52,618
please raise your hand.

1115
01:40:01,919 --> 01:40:03,545
Congratulations, young man.

1116
01:40:05,797 --> 01:40:06,882
Any others?

1117
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:29,238
All right. Fresh out of the oven.
One calibrated spectrophotometer.

1118
01:40:29,738 --> 01:40:30,822
It looks amazing.

1119
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:33,200
-Let me know when you're ready.
-Yes, sir.

1120
01:40:47,214 --> 01:40:50,217
Okay! Power it up, Mike! I'm ready!

1121
01:40:50,926 --> 01:40:53,554
Okay. Initializing installation. Go!
