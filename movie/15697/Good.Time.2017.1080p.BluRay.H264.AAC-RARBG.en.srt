1
00:01:17,948 --> 00:01:19,115
Okay, Nick,

2
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,323
we're getting
close to the end.

3
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:23,448
But we're moving
into a new section now,

4
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:26,117
what they call
sentence interpretation.

5
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:28,450
Do you understand that?

6
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,284
You know what interpreting
a sentence means?

7
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:35,283
No.

8
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:37,783
It's just a fancy word

9
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:40,866
for telling what the words
mean to you.

10
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,158
- Okay.
- Okay.

11
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:43,325
And what these are,

12
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:46,201
these are common expressions
that people

13
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,617
sometimes say.

14
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:49,368
You might hear it
out on the street,

15
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:51,368
you might've seen it on TV,

16
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:52,953
uh, maybe a friend,

17
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:54,451
maybe your grandmother.

18
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,703
So, I'm going to read you
a few of those, okay?

19
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:58,286
- Okay.
- All right.

20
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,537
Uh, the first one is,

21
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:03,620
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch."

22
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,328
What does that mean to you,
that expression?

23
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:08,787
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch?"

24
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,622
Don't count your chickens.

25
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:13,625
Okay.

26
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,454
What are you writing down?

27
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:22,288
Well, the reason I'm asking
you the questions is

28
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:23,329
because I'm supposed
to write...

29
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,622
You know,
write down the answers...

30
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:25,955
Yeah,
but that's what I'm saying.

31
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:27,455
Why are you writing that down?

32
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:29,330
So, in case I forget it later.

33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,789
But I don't like
people talking about me

34
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,372
after I go places.

35
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:34,288
I don't blame you. I'm not...
And I'm not talking about you.

36
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,664
This is just for me.
These are my own notes.

37
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:38,039
No one sees them but me.

38
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,540
I don't like it, but...

39
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,498
All right, here's another one.

40
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:45,540
"It's the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease."

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,007
What does that expression
mean to you?

42
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,461
You ever heard that before?

43
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,003
Nick?

44
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:04,376
Okay, Nick, you know what?

45
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:05,668
Why don't we skip this section

46
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:06,876
and just move on
to the next one?

47
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:09,127
It's actually more fun.
It's easier.

48
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:10,544
It's called word comparisons.

49
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:13,294
It's two words that
don't appear to be connected,

50
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,794
and then you say what
you think when you hear

51
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,836
the two words together. Okay?

52
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:17,961
Okay.

53
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:19,962
All right. First one is

54
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:22,628
cat and mouse.

55
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,045
What does that make you think?

56
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:28,461
They don't like each other.

57
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,378
That's right. They're kind of

58
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,129
enemies against
each other, right?

59
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,503
That's what I said.

60
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,463
Okay, um...

61
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:42,462
How about scissors
and a cooking pan?

62
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:45,213
You can hurt yourself
with both.

63
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:46,509
Okay.

64
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,966
How about salt and water?

65
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,632
The beach.

66
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:56,716
The beach.

67
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,888
That's a good answer.

68
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,341
Um...

69
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,633
Do you mind, could we go back

70
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,633
to the scissors
and the cooking pan?

71
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,300
Um...

72
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,550
When you said
you can hurt yourself,

73
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,009
what were you...
What did you mean?

74
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:16,636
Do you ever think
about hurting yourself?

75
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:22,134
Why did you think
of being hurt?

76
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:23,886
Because I touched the pan,
and I hurt my hand.

77
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,050
Oh, well,
that makes perfect sense.

78
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,846
What happened?

79
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:33,682
Do you remember when it was?

80
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,346
Do you not want
to talk about this?

81
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:45,470
I was sitting there
and trying to eat.

82
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,803
And she started yelling at me,
and pushing me,

83
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,846
and just telling me
I can't eat food.

84
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,221
That was your grandmother
who was saying that?

85
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,637
Yeah, and then
she threw stuff at me.

86
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:52,889
- She threw things at you?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,387
Then I picked up the pan,
and I threw it at her.

88
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,305
You threw it
at your grandmother?

89
00:04:58,305 --> 00:04:59,555
I threw it at the wall.

90
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:02,062
Oh, you weren't trying
to hit your grandmother?

91
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:11,643
Did you burn yourself
when you threw the pan?

92
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,350
Nick?

93
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:23,516
Nick, it's good that
we should talk about this.

94
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:24,725
This is good stuff

95
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,309
we're talking about.

96
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,641
- Excuse me.
- Are you Peter?

97
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,141
Yes, I am. We're in the middle
of a session. Hello?

98
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:31,350
Nick, what are you doing?

99
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,516
We're in the middle
of something here.

100
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:32,850
- The middle of an exam.
- Come on, get up!

101
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,975
- Hey, Nick, Nick...
- He's asking me about

102
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:36,057
the stuff, the pan,

103
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,350
- and the chicken.
- Wait, please!

104
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,018
How would you like it
if I made you cry, huh?

105
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:40,975
- Would you like that?
- No, I would not. But...

106
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,393
They told me
I had to do this.

107
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:43,643
Get up. Let's go. Let's go!

108
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,726
But he wrote...
He has all my stuff!

109
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,643
Rip that shit up then!

110
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,560
This is my work.
This is my stuff, okay?

111
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,976
Oh,
shame on you, Connie.

112
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,478
- Shame on me? Shame on you.
- You're not helping.

113
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,851
Shame on you!

114
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,060
- Come on.
- Janice, please,

115
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,240
could you send
Mark and Matthew right away?

116
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:13,312
Is that what
you think you are?

117
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,322
What?

118
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:24,646
Jesus Christ.

119
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:27,646
I'm sorry. It's just that
Grandma said that...

120
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,148
I don't wanna hear about
Grandma anymore, all right?

121
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:30,646
Fuck Grandma, Nicky.

122
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:34,069
It's just you and me.
I'm your friend, all right?

123
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:43,005
I love you, all right?

124
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:08,735
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop messing with it.

125
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:10,726
Next?

126
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:08,331
What are you thinking about?

127
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,206
Nothing.

128
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:17,556
It's almost over.

129
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,259
Stay calm.

130
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,879
No, no. No running.

131
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,086
Hey.

132
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:11,171
- The mask.
- What about it?

133
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:13,046
The mask.
I want to take it off.

134
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,004
- Huh?
- I want to take off the mask.

135
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,546
We'll take it off
in two minutes. Two minutes.

136
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:20,379
It's all finished now,
and everything's great.

137
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,504
Nick! Nick!

138
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:23,759
- Where?
- Down this alley.

139
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:31,344
Start taking your shit off.

140
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,256
It's not coming off.

141
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:39,423
It's not coming off.

142
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,173
Connie, help! Help!
I can't breathe.

143
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,341
I can't breathe.

144
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,423
Remember how we did it?

145
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:45,841
Fingers under the flap
and pull up.

146
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,383
Push it up. Push it up!

147
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,341
Push it up, push it up!
Push it up!

148
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:52,552
You were fucking incredible.

149
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,509
You were incredible.
Do you understand?

150
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:56,676
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

151
00:10:56,676 --> 00:10:57,926
You think I could have done it

152
00:10:57,926 --> 00:10:59,841
without you standing
next to me, being strong?

153
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,841
No.

154
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,176
You feel it, Nicks?

155
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:04,009
Are you feeling as good
as I'm feeling right now?

156
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,842
- Yeah, I'm cold.
- You're cold?

157
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,592
- Yeah.
- Hey, fuck it.

158
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:08,691
- Let's get to Virginia, man.
- All right.

159
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:38,849
What the fuck?

160
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:42,846
Nick! Nick! Come here.

161
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:43,888
Stay with me.

162
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,013
Where'd he go?

163
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,056
Where are you?

164
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:47,346
Is he at the bank?

165
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:48,681
You circling around?
I'm on the corner.

166
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,181
I'm on the corner
where you dropped me off.

167
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:52,099
You gotta get
back here right now.

168
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:55,014
I'm outside the Mango Rico.

169
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,890
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

170
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:58,518
He's here?

171
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,390
- Get in the car.
- Yeah.

172
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,432
I'm so sorry.
The cops, they moved me here.

173
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:11,932
- Don't want me there.
- Don't worry about it.

174
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,267
Let's go.

175
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,057
Are we still going
to the Port Authority?

176
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,517
Yes, nothing's changed,
exact same place.

177
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:41,563
You wanna hold it?

178
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,692
Yeah. I don't care.

179
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,398
What was that sound?

180
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,897
What the fuck
did you do?

181
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:27,941
My face. My face.

182
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,524
My face, my face.
My face is burning.

183
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:32,899
- My face is burning.
- Your face isn't burning.

184
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,274
- My face is burning.
- Hey, look at me, look at me.

185
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:35,524
- Connie, my face is burning.
- Look at me.

186
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,899
Your face isn't burning.
You'll be all right.

187
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,734
Look, look, look.

188
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,192
My face.

189
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:41,402
- My face, Connie. My...
- Just breathe, just breathe.

190
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,236
- We going for a walk?
- No, no.

191
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,692
I think
I'm gonna throw up.

192
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:52,693
You're not going
to fucking throw up. Come on.

193
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:53,860
I'm gonna throw up.

194
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,735
No.
What did I just tell you?

195
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:55,902
I don't know.

196
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,193
I told you you're not
going to throw up,

197
00:13:57,193 --> 00:14:00,028
so you're not going
to throw up, all right?

198
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:02,610
You're not.

199
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,736
Count to 30.

200
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,570
One, two, three, four...

201
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,947
Keep counting!

202
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:12,696
It's an emergency.
I gotta use the bathroom.

203
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,196
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no.

204
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,279
Bathrooms
are for customers only.

205
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,740
Hey, customers only.

206
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:23,030
Hey.

207
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,072
Yes,
I'm gonna get something.

208
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:24,364
Just give me five minutes.

209
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,864
No, no. Open up now!

210
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:29,740
Just wash that shit
off your face already.

211
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,697
Nick, what the fuck are you
doing? Get in the sink.

212
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:33,365
Jesus Christ.

213
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:36,865
- Put your hands up.
- Come out!

214
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:39,072
- Take it off.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,448
In five seconds,
I'll call the police!

216
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:42,365
Get off anything
with red or pink dye, okay?

217
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,033
My brother is
mentally handicapped.

218
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,698
A bucket of paint
fell off a construction truck

219
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:46,907
and hit him on the head.

220
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:48,033
I'm gonna come out
in one second.

221
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,700
It's an emergency, all right?

222
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,950
Please, just give me
five minutes.

223
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,533
- It burns, it burns.
- Stop, stop it.

224
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,866
The pants got dye all over
them. Got to get them off.

225
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,451
I like these pants.

226
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:59,033
I don't care if you like them.
Gotta get them off right now.

227
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,701
You got sweatpants underneath.
That's why you wore them.

228
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,533
Hurry up. Lace them up.

229
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:04,868
Look for anything...

230
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:07,211
- Yes, yes, yes, please.
- Come out now!

231
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,379
Just keep your head down.

232
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:51,581
Gonna pull back up on us.

233
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:52,873
Just don't say anything,
all right?

234
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,373
- Okay.
- Don't look at them.

235
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:55,539
Don't be scared.

236
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,585
- All right.
- Let me do all the talking.

237
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:02,249
Hey fellas, where we going?

238
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:04,706
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

239
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:06,206
First of all, could you take
your hoodie off for me?

240
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,541
Why? What did we do wrong?

241
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,582
Hey.
You with the black sweatshirt.

242
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:10,250
Yo, my man, turn around!

243
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:12,458
He's all right.
We didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,375
Yo, oh, oh!
Get back here!

245
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,963
NYPD: Stop!

246
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,716
Nick, let's go!

247
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,303
Nick!

248
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,380
Connie!

249
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:07,713
Stop! Stop!

250
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:08,798
You're under...

251
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,465
NYPD:
You are not getting up.

252
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,885
Sir, I need you to get up!

253
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:31,800
Thanks for the welcome.

254
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:52,595
Yo, CO!

255
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,384
Let me talk
to the fucking captain, man.

256
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:56,594
I've been here for four days!

257
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:59,385
- Get off the bars!
- Fuck!

258
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,221
Stop fighting!

259
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,556
Stop fighting!
Get the captain.

260
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:13,887
Stop fighting.

261
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,599
Stop fighting or chemical
weapons will be utilized.

262
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:21,439
Stop fighting.

263
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,557
The judge is gonna ask her
about Connie.

264
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,973
And if she says to the judge,
"I can't talk about that."

265
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,474
He's gonna say, "Then go away,
I'm not going to help Nick."

266
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:54,058
She needs to keep the judge
happy, answer his questions.

267
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:56,142
She can't do that
unless you answer

268
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:57,557
- her questions first.
- I don't like to.

269
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:59,267
I don't want to.

270
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,558
The point is, it doesn't
matter what you tell me.

271
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:01,893
It doesn't matter
what you say.

272
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:03,768
It doesn't matter what we do
in this time together.

273
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,059
Nothing that you and I

274
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,601
do here is going to get
your brother in trouble.

275
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:07,393
Then why do you keep
asking about him?

276
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:08,893
Because, you know what?

277
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:11,894
The thing is, is that I don't
think you're as responsible

278
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:13,646
for this
as you believe that you are.

279
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,104
That money was for us.

280
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:40,896
And he was going
to buy me a farm,

281
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:42,646
and we were gonna
live in the woods.

282
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,563
And I was going to be able
to do whatever I wanted,

283
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,896
when I wanted, okay?

284
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,146
You don't love me, okay?

285
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:48,397
He loves me. Connie loves me!

286
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:49,772
Talking all day
on the phone over here, man.

287
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,772
You don't know
what love is!

288
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,980
Yo, son,
can you please hurry up?

289
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,605
I don't want to talk
to you no more! Okay?

290
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:54,730
That was for us.

291
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,106
- Hey, yo...
- He did it for us.

292
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,086
I'm talking
to my grandmother, okay?

293
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:21,733
16,480.
You need another ten grand.

294
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,067
You can't do anything
with this?

295
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:24,651
This stuff is dirty.
It's nasty.

296
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:26,108
You can't clean it?
You can't do nothing with it?

297
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,234
Nah, nah, nah. Come on.
It's all garbage.

298
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:29,902
You get another ten grand,

299
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:31,652
I'll get the judge
to sign the order.

300
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:32,818
And that's it.
I'll have the order

301
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:33,902
waiting for you.

302
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:35,943
Your brother will get out.

303
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,405
Go get the ten grand.

304
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,403
We're gonna watch Empire.

305
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:52,903
What the fuck are you doing?

306
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,612
I was watching this channel.
You can't do that.

307
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:55,737
I was watching
something in it before.

308
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,822
You do not rock
on this TV, man.

309
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,069
Hey, yo, man.

310
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:01,238
If I was you,
I wouldn't fuck with the TV.

311
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:03,445
- Just leave it alone.
- Don't talk to me, all right.

312
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:04,613
I don't like you, all right?

313
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:05,946
- Don't talk to me.
- You got that green...

314
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,239
Nobody
was in here before.

315
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,070
I'm allowed to watch
whatever I want.

316
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,406
Yo, my man.
Don't touch that TV!

317
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:12,615
Man, this is some...

318
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,073
What the fuck
is you doing, man?

319
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:18,155
Give me that!

320
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,906
Are you not entertained, huh?

321
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,156
Not entertained?

322
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,115
I told you
I was gonna get you,

323
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,740
you bitch motherfucker!

324
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,787
- I got it!
- No, no, I'm here.

325
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:17,121
- Who is it?
- It's Connie.

326
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:18,663
Con...

327
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:20,453
No, no, no, no.

328
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:23,247
Ma... Mama,
I called him down.

329
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,413
Wait a minute.
How'd you get in the building?

330
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,663
- I invited him up.
- They didn't call up.

331
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:29,663
The doorman recognized me.

332
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:30,788
He's not
coming in here.

333
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:32,248
Yes, he is.

334
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:34,749
Well, I can just
come back later, Loren.

335
00:22:35,748 --> 00:22:36,999
Hey.

336
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,582
Connie,
we're having dinner.

337
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:39,748
And I think

338
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:40,832
- if you could just...
- I... I can leave.

339
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,082
No, no, no.

340
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:43,832
- Go to my room.
- This is a very bad

341
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:44,834
time for us.

342
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,083
What's wrong with you?

343
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,249
What's wrong with you?

344
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:49,665
How rude!
I'd never treat

345
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:49,916
one of your friends this way.

346
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:52,833
- Look at you!
- What?

347
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,165
I'm begging you
to shut your mouth!

348
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,750
- Shut my mouth?
- Please, please...

349
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,750
Would you just
please go look at yourself

350
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,585
in the mirror?

351
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:05,417
Just look at yourself.
This morning you were fine.

352
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,585
What are you
talking about?

353
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,750
I'm fine right now.

354
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,167
This is your problem.

355
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:10,750
Would you just
do me a favor?

356
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,917
- You know what?
- What?

357
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,167
Call Dr. Klienman.

358
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,669
Why don't you call him?

359
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:16,586
I have a friend over.

360
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,751
Mom, I want to stop
this conversation.

361
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:20,336
- Yes, yes.
- I am stopping it!

362
00:23:20,336 --> 00:23:22,295
- Yes.
- I'm zipping it!

363
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:23,586
And I'm gonna go
visit with my friend.

364
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:25,752
- Yes.
- You get a hold of yourself!

365
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,796
- Do that.
- Fucking freak!

366
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,086
Puerto Vallarta.

367
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:35,005
They have the best,
best hotels.

368
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,170
I love it there.

369
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,087
There's a Grand Miramar
resort and spa.

370
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:39,462
You can drink
right in the pool.

371
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:41,505
It's like they have
a whole bar.

372
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,462
Ah, fuck.
The flight's too long.

373
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:45,921
It's like eight hours.

374
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,089
Okay, that's all right.

375
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:49,922
What about Florida?

376
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:51,423
Or hey, hey, hey.

377
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:52,631
Can you just put it down
for a second?

378
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,673
Costa Rica.

379
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:54,922
Just put it down for a second.

380
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:56,964
I gotta come clean
with you about something.

381
00:23:56,964 --> 00:23:58,009
What?

382
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,257
So, I told you
about my brother, yeah?

383
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,340
Yeah.

384
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,757
I told you
about the program

385
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,174
he's forced to attend and
how he shouldn't be there.

386
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:07,464
Yeah.

387
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:07,842
And how everybody
involved with it doesn't know

388
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,258
what the fuck they're doing,
and he fucking hates it.

389
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:13,299
Hey, Costa Rica's
only four and a half hours...

390
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:15,092
Please, could you just put it
down for two seconds.

391
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:16,011
Just listen to
what I'm saying.

392
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,178
Look,

393
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,759
something happened,
I don't know exactly what.

394
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,593
But one of the therapists
was abusing him,

395
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,634
and I guess he must have
lashed out violently,

396
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,260
and he really hurt the guy.

397
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:35,926
Now this guy's
gonna press charges.

398
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:37,010
My brother's been arrested.

399
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,302
He's being held
at Riker's Island.

400
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,344
Oh, my God, that's awful.

401
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:41,636
I know.

402
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:44,427
You have no idea.

403
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,760
I've just gotta get him
out of there

404
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,138
before something bad happens.

405
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:50,516
See, he could get
killed in there.

406
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,096
I'm just a little short
on the bail money right now.

407
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,263
How short?

408
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:01,680
It's like a few thousand.

409
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,971
Okay. That's not bad.

410
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:04,763
That's why I was just hoping
your mom's credit card

411
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:07,640
could cover the rest of it.

412
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:10,932
Oh. Um...

413
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,307
Look, it's just to get him
out of Riker's.

414
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,931
It's like a temporary loan.

415
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:18,017
You get it right back.

416
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:21,140
Any judge is
gonna dismiss this

417
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,432
as soon as he gets to court.

418
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:25,682
Yeah.

419
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:26,973
Okay?

420
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:28,807
What, and our trip?

421
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,517
We'll go after?

422
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:33,099
Seriously,
that's your response

423
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,851
to what I just told you?

424
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:37,433
That's your response?

425
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:41,433
Um, I mean, I'm thinking
about your brother, too.

426
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:42,309
Yo!

427
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,642
We gotta make
a different stop.

428
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:46,808
It's still Queens. It's, uh...

429
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:49,808
82nd and Queens Boulevard.

430
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:51,309
It's near the Union Turnpike.

431
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:51,979
Eric, he's coming.

432
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:55,310
What'd I tell ya?

433
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,934
Couple of hours, right?

434
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:57,978
Yeah. You got the full ten?

435
00:25:58,977 --> 00:26:00,310
10,000?

436
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,603
- $10,000.
- Yeah.

437
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,144
- You do credit, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

438
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:05,771
Wait. $10,000?

439
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,019
Yeah.

440
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,269
You said it was like
a couple thousand dollars.

441
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,479
It's a loan.

442
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,436
You get it back
the same time as the three.

443
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:14,604
What's the difference?

444
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:16,520
It's like $7,000 difference,
you know.

445
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,688
It's for my brother.
You're gonna get it back

446
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:19,855
the same day. Right? Right?

447
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:20,980
Yeah, yeah,
she'll get it back.

448
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,190
You'll get it back.

449
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:23,775
Are we cool?

450
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:29,105
- It's for my brother.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

451
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:30,146
It's fine. It's fine.

452
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:31,271
Hey, can you
put it through right now?

453
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,355
I want to get him out tonight.

454
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:35,481
Tonight? It's 8:35.

455
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:37,147
Judges go to dinner at 9:00.

456
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:38,773
So what?
What's the problem?

457
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:40,481
Can you not make a call?

458
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:41,606
They go to dinner.

459
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,440
It's only 20 minutes
to do the bond,

460
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,106
- prepare the paperwork.
- You got 20 minutes.

461
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:46,607
Can't you at least
see what's possible?

462
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,273
- She's paying already.
- I got you.

463
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,777
You're being pushy.

464
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:53,608
Thank you.

465
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,484
Hi, Bobby, how are you?

466
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:01,942
Yeah, I know, I know.

467
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:05,442
Sorry. I just have a client
that walked in.

468
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:07,612
Wanted me to post a bond now.

469
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:11,694
Yeah, can you just
check, please?

470
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:16,487
Last name N-I-K-A-S. Nikolas.

471
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:18,945
You think the judge will wait?

472
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,778
Come on, just ask.

473
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:23,278
We good?

474
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:24,654
It's pretty late for this.

475
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:27,444
Sorry, it's taking
longer. The new system...

476
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:29,613
I know.
Those chips are such a...

477
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:32,195
They're the bane
of my existence.

478
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:32,945
Ah...

479
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,987
Hold on. He's not on...

480
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,445
He's not on the calendar
for tonight.

481
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:38,529
What's the calendar?

482
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:40,863
Where is he?

483
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:43,863
Do you see anything there,
any notations?

484
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,447
He's at Elmhurst.

485
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:46,822
Lovely. Elmhurst.

486
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:48,322
Elmhurst, the hospital?

487
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:49,530
Yeah, like where
sick people go.

488
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:52,030
What's...
What's wrong with him?

489
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,615
They're not gonna tell ya.
It's privileged information.

490
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:54,822
Does this mean
we're not going?

491
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:56,114
He's not going
to be arraigned in court

492
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:57,155
because they've got him
in the hospital.

493
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,280
Can we still go away?

494
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,698
So until he gets
a medical clearance,

495
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:01,156
they're not going to put him
on the calendar.

496
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:02,490
When's that going to be?

497
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,115
Bobby, give me a second.
Just bear with me.

498
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,449
When did he
get put in the hospital?

499
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:06,490
The card is declined.

500
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:09,990
I think maybe
you're punching it in wrong,

501
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,782
or something?
'Cause I just used it.

502
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:13,450
What the fuck
is wrong with your card?

503
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:13,617
I have no idea.

504
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:15,700
You can call
the bank if you want.

505
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,826
I do want to call them.

506
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:19,532
I will dial for you,
and you do it.

507
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,159
Hold on, Bobby.
What do you want to do?

508
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,784
Can you not call someone?

509
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,451
Give me a second.
I'm going to call Corrections.

510
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:26,284
I'll see what I can find out.

511
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:27,618
I'm going to punch
the numbers, and then...

512
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,702
Fuck! It's my mom.

513
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:33,951
I'm so sorry.

514
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:35,868
I'm so sorry.

515
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:37,368
Hi, Mom.

516
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:41,286
Did you, um, cancel the card?

517
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,037
Did you...

518
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,452
Do you want to talk to them?

519
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:45,869
Mom! Sorry, sorry.

520
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:47,369
- Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Calm down.

521
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:48,494
No, no, no,
of course, of course.

522
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,287
Mom, Mom, Mom,
please listen to me.

523
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,663
I'm at a legitimate...

524
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:53,953
It's a bail bonds place.

525
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:54,788
So the thing is this.
The thing is...

526
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:56,287
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Hold on.

527
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,288
- We get the money back! Mom.
- I'll call you back, Bobby.

528
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:00,954
Chaos. Hold on a second.

529
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:02,372
Can you take that outside?

530
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,329
Sorry. Excuse me, sir.
It's a legitimate loan.

531
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,163
Okay. We've got
ten minutes, decide.

532
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,454
What do you want to do?

533
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,621
Look. It's a fucking disaster.

534
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,288
I didn't know she was going
to be like this.

535
00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:11,955
I don't like people
yelling in my office.

536
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:13,288
I understand, I understand.

537
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:14,789
Just let me get back
the money from earlier,

538
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,455
and I'll come back
with the rest in full.

539
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:17,957
The money in my safe?

540
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,789
No, that stays in the safe.

541
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:20,957
You want to get
your brother out?

542
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:22,332
You bring me
the other ten grand.

543
00:29:22,332 --> 00:29:23,624
That's how it works.

544
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:24,665
Come on, man.
Just give me a break, please.

545
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:26,624
I'm giving you a break.

546
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:29,290
That money stays in the safe.
That's mine.

547
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,040
You get the other ten,
I'll get your brother out.

548
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,666
You are so good.

549
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,542
Please, this isn't your fault.

550
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,522
I just wanted to do
a good thing for somebody.

551
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,134
Hey, man,
what's with all the cops?

552
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,053
What do you mean?

553
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,135
There's cops everywhere.

554
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,636
Cops outside my dad's room.

555
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:20,469
All right,
what floor is he on?

556
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:21,803
Five.

557
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:23,385
There's not supposed to be
any prisoners on five.

558
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:25,220
They're supposed to be on six.

559
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,970
Supposed to be on six?

560
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,971
That's unacceptable.

561
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,221
Excuse me.

562
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:44,555
Where's the nearest bathroom?

563
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:45,971
Down the hall, to the left.

564
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:46,505
Thank you.

565
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:33,309
Hey.

566
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,227
Something just scared
the shit out of me, man.

567
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:35,394
What?

568
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:39,309
I was sleeping with my dad
down the hall.

569
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:42,394
Who's dying, so I'm already
half freaked out already.

570
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:46,060
And, uh, all the TV channels
started changing on their own.

571
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,478
When I get up, it stops.

572
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:50,478
When I sit back down,
they all start changing again.

573
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:51,813
So I...

574
00:32:52,811 --> 00:32:54,644
What the fuck is that?

575
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,894
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

576
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,645
Fuck, man.
I'm think I'm losing my mind.

577
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:05,230
I've been here
48 hours straight.

578
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,895
Want something
from the vending machine?

579
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:08,410
Nah, I'm good. Thank you.

580
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:22,487
Hello?

581
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,651
Hello?

582
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:15,320
Going down
to vending to get some coffee.

583
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,987
You want some?

584
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,862
Yeah, get me a coffee.

585
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:21,195
I'll see you in a sec.

586
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:47,503
Excuse me, ma'am.

587
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:48,170
Do you mind
if I put my brother on first?

588
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,836
It's so cold, and he doesn't
have a jacket or anything.

589
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:53,711
- Is that all right?
- You don't mind?

590
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,045
All right.

591
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:57,338
Thank you so much.
God bless you.

592
00:36:57,338 --> 00:36:59,215
Turn him
to the side. There you go.

593
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:03,588
All right.

594
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,170
Thank you.

595
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,338
Ready?

596
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:08,505
Hey, can we get on now?

597
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:11,422
Yeah,
you guys can get on.

598
00:37:11,422 --> 00:37:12,844
Just go in this way.

599
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,173
Okay.

600
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,423
There we go.

601
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:26,507
All right.

602
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:28,583
Push it. There you go.

603
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:05,052
6180 Woodhaven.

604
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,177
That's ours.
Close to the building, please.

605
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:08,847
Okay.

606
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:15,021
- Regal Garden.
- That's us. That's us.

607
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,184
220 Fourth Avenue.

608
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:36,518
Okay.
Thank you so much.

609
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:40,766
Excuse me.

610
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,014
- Good night.
- Thank you.

611
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:44,556
I hope you feel better.

612
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,931
You, too.

613
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:49,516
- Hope he does, too.
- Okay now...

614
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:50,769
Bring your feet up.

615
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:55,434
Hey, yo!

616
00:38:56,432 --> 00:38:59,891
I only had three stops.
I didn't know about a fourth.

617
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:01,684
That's odd, man.
I definitely called.

618
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,684
This dispatch
be messing me up.

619
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:04,766
It's all good.

620
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,351
We only live
a few blocks from here.

621
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:08,018
That's why I figured
you were leaving us last.

622
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:10,893
A few blocks.
What, like two blocks?

623
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:15,101
Like a literal two blocks
or a "15 minutes" two blocks?

624
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:16,228
Two blocks. It's right there.

625
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:19,559
All right, I got you.

626
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,436
Thank you.

627
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:23,561
All right, say when.

628
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,853
Uh...

629
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:28,061
It's just down here
on the right.

630
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:29,603
It's the one
with the driveway.

631
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,436
- You don't got to pull in.
- Oh, yeah?

632
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:32,603
I'll just push him from here.

633
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,561
Perfect, thanks, man.

634
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:40,070
Yep.

635
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:54,773
- Crystal?
- Hmm?

636
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:56,940
Look for me,
do not open.

637
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,273
Who's this? I don't know.

638
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,193
Every second!

639
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,356
Can I help you?

640
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:06,398
Hey, what's up?

641
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:08,940
Is there an older couple
that lives here?

642
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,190
- Annie?
- I just got dropped off

643
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,773
- by the Access-A-Ride.
- Oh, Lord!

644
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:13,358
What happened again?

645
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:15,358
Somebody
at the door for you.

646
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:16,525
Who is it?

647
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:18,402
I don't know.
Some white guy.

648
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,900
Uh...

649
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,108
I'm hoping you recognize me
from the Access-A-Ride.

650
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:25,733
Yeah.

651
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,025
The driver just dropped us
off on our house on 23rd,

652
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,693
and I can't find
my keys anywhere.

653
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:33,277
And my brother doesn't have
a jacket, and it's freezing.

654
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:35,277
Is there any way
I can use your phone?

655
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:36,860
Just for, like, two minutes?

656
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,695
That's okay. That's okay.

657
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:40,735
God bless you.

658
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:42,402
- God bless you.
- Come in.

659
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:43,735
It's so cold.

660
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,402
It's freezing.

661
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,610
All right.

662
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:57,195
This is the phone,
okay?

663
00:40:57,195 --> 00:40:59,405
If you use the phone,
do not unplug.

664
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:00,530
All right.

665
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,028
The battery no good.

666
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:04,407
- It's messed up, okay?
- Okay.

667
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:08,862
Thank you.

668
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:11,907
Uh...

669
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,697
Oh, God damn it.

670
00:41:16,697 --> 00:41:20,699
Mom, it's Connie. Nick and I
are locked out of the house,

671
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:24,239
and I don't have my keys
or my wallet or anything.

672
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,199
So we're gonna wait at

673
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,449
the Dunkin' Donuts
until you get off work.

674
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:33,240
But if you get this message,
can you call me back at...

675
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,699
What's the number here?

676
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:37,367
- 917.
- 917.

677
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,367
- 718.
- 718.

678
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,199
- 63.
- 63.

679
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,201
- 17.
- 17.

680
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,617
So, yeah, call me back
if you get this

681
00:41:45,617 --> 00:41:47,034
in the next, like,
five minutes.

682
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:48,534
Okay.

683
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,952
Um, can I just leave him here

684
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:55,409
for, like, ten minutes
while I go break a window?

685
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:56,577
Why?

686
00:41:56,577 --> 00:41:58,077
Why?

687
00:41:58,077 --> 00:41:59,909
- So I can get into my house.
- What window?

688
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:01,536
Uh, my window.

689
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,202
- My window! Not yours.
- Why did you not call

690
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:03,869
- a locksmith?
- Because I don't have

691
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:06,536
any money in my...
I don't have my wallet.

692
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:07,702
I don't have any money either.

693
00:42:07,702 --> 00:42:09,744
No, no. I understand.

694
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,077
Um... Could I...

695
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:13,244
Could I borrow

696
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:13,871
some clothes for him?
Because I...

697
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:17,204
How many hours
does your mother work?

698
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,704
Well, she gets off at,
like, 7:00, so she'll be back

699
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:19,911
at, like, 7:30. But...

700
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:21,538
Um, I hoping
she gets my message.

701
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,954
If you want,
I can give you a room,

702
00:42:23,954 --> 00:42:25,954
not you, for your brother.

703
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:27,289
You wait until your mother

704
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:29,289
- came back from work.
- Yeah?

705
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:30,789
Yeah.

706
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:32,039
It's gonna be a long time,

707
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,539
that's, like, seven hours.
But is that okay?

708
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:35,248
Let me show you the room.

709
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,039
Why, thank you so much.
That's...

710
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,708
Let me
show you the room.

711
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:42,884
Come with me.

712
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,875
But, sorry,
the light doesn't work.

713
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,382
We have the TV, okay?

714
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:07,376
Okay. Leave him there.

715
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,923
Come with me.

716
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,461
I've been sitting
on the couch,

717
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,210
watching TV.

718
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,043
The remote doesn't work.
Okay? It's no good.

719
00:43:23,043 --> 00:43:24,460
If you want
to change the channel,

720
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,420
- you go in the box, okay?
- Okay, I can just sit here.

721
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,545
It's fine. Thank you so much.

722
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:28,918
Okay, okay,
that's enough.

723
00:43:28,918 --> 00:43:29,378
Crystal?

724
00:43:30,378 --> 00:43:31,420
Yes?

725
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,592
Come on, baby.

726
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:40,880
Listen.

727
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,378
- I have work tomorrow.
- Mmm-hmm.

728
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:43,963
I'm going to take my medicine

729
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:44,755
- to sleep, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

730
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:48,045
Put your phone down, Crystal!

731
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,463
Always giving me
problems with the phone!

732
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,130
Stop the phone, okay?

733
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:52,755
All the time
you're doing that to me.

734
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:55,130
When I'm talking to you,

735
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,630
I don't want your eye
in the phone.

736
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,922
You have to watch me,
eyes to eyes.

737
00:43:58,922 --> 00:44:00,737
Okay. Okay.

738
00:44:22,717 --> 00:44:24,483
Shit.

739
00:44:42,635 --> 00:44:44,052
Um, I'm sorry,

740
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:46,302
I just need to look
for something really quickly.

741
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:47,552
Yeah, it's fine.
Just don't, uh...

742
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:48,768
Just try not to wake him up.

743
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:58,304
Um...

744
00:44:58,304 --> 00:44:59,766
What's that in your hair?

745
00:45:02,762 --> 00:45:06,597
This? I found some hair dye
in your bathroom.

746
00:45:06,597 --> 00:45:08,057
You dyed your hair?

747
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:11,891
Yeah.

748
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:16,097
Just kind of a weirdo.

749
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:18,431
I hope
that's not the one

750
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:19,806
from the bottom
of the cabinet.

751
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:23,556
- Hold on a second.
- I don't know what color

752
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:25,222
- your hair is gonna turn out.
- I hope you don't mind.

753
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,639
I took your mom's
phone in here.

754
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:28,264
That's not my mom.
That's my grandmother,

755
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:29,931
and I don't care what you do
with that lady's phone.

756
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:31,556
As long as you don't
bring it back...

757
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:34,391
Sorry, this is my mother.
I just need to take this.

758
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:36,224
Okay.

759
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:37,391
Hey, I said hold on

760
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:38,766
- for a second.
- Hold on to what?

761
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:40,641
You don't understand.
Everything's falling apart.

762
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,059
No. Stop it.

763
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:43,601
Stop what?
Where are you?

764
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:45,809
- I'm with Nick right now.
- What?

765
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,391
Oh, great.
So you got your brother back,

766
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,726
and now you don't need me?

767
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,726
No, just calm down,
calm down.

768
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:52,143
There's no reason to worry.

769
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:54,726
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

770
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:56,893
- I just...
- No, just hold on a second.

771
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:58,393
What I'm gonna need you to do,

772
00:45:58,393 --> 00:45:59,893
you get a cab
and you come pick us up.

773
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:01,143
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner here.

774
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:02,561
My mom spoke to the doorman

775
00:46:02,561 --> 00:46:04,393
and told him to call her
if I try to leave.

776
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:05,646
What time does
the doorman switch shifts?

777
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:08,144
At 5:00 or 6:00.

778
00:46:08,144 --> 00:46:09,769
Okay. At 5:00 a.m.,

779
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,811
you go downstairs,
get a car and come pick us up.

780
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,228
Oh,
I don't know, Connie.

781
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,896
I'm sorry. I can't stay
on the phone much longer.

782
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:16,228
It's rude. It's not my phone.

783
00:46:16,228 --> 00:46:17,311
It's rude?
Whose phone is it?

784
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:18,394
Where are you?

785
00:46:18,394 --> 00:46:19,478
What's the address here?

786
00:46:19,478 --> 00:46:21,230
220 Fourth Avenue.

787
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:23,771
Connie, who is that?

788
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:25,730
Who are you talking to?

789
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,646
Connie. Hello? Hello?

790
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:28,648
I just sent you the address.
Did you get it?

791
00:46:29,646 --> 00:46:31,606
Uh, yeah.

792
00:46:31,606 --> 00:46:34,230
Okay, so come pick us up
as soon as you can.

793
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,230
I love you. See you in a bit.

794
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,396
I thought I should
let you know,

795
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:38,481
but my grandmother told me

796
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:40,065
- not to talk to you.
- Hey.

797
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:41,648
I don't care
what she says anyways. But...

798
00:46:41,648 --> 00:46:44,773
Would you mind
just talking outside?

799
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:46,231
I really don't want
to wake him up.

800
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,242
Let's just go outside.

801
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:58,442
Just gonna make my brother
something to eat.

802
00:46:58,442 --> 00:46:58,735
You want something?

803
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:02,317
Uh...

804
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:03,818
I wouldn't do that.

805
00:47:05,817 --> 00:47:07,108
What is all this shit?

806
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:09,318
You're not really
gonna find anything.

807
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:10,610
I have chicken nuggets
in here actually.

808
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,150
Um, that should be good.

809
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:13,958
Yeah.

810
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,402
How old are you?

811
00:47:29,402 --> 00:47:30,820
Um, I'm 16.

812
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,905
Sixteen?

813
00:47:33,903 --> 00:47:36,237
You look way older than that.

814
00:47:36,237 --> 00:47:38,407
I know. I get that.

815
00:47:42,403 --> 00:47:45,072
So what's up?
You just stay up all night?

816
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:47,447
I go back in my room.

817
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:52,112
Stay up, eat,
watch movies, smoke.

818
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:54,492
- Is that weed?
- Yeah.

819
00:47:57,489 --> 00:47:58,784
It has no effect on me.
I'm immune to it.

820
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:03,447
My boyfriend sells this shit.

821
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:03,784
For like $30.

822
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,490
How old's your boyfriend?

823
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:10,282
He's not my boyfriend. My ex.

824
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:13,449
- He's a drug dealer?
- Yeah.

825
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:16,159
Where does he live?

826
00:48:17,157 --> 00:48:19,574
Can't disclose that.

827
00:48:19,574 --> 00:48:21,074
Oh, yeah? Why not?

828
00:48:21,074 --> 00:48:22,909
'Cause it's gonna
make his house hot.

829
00:48:22,909 --> 00:48:24,117
Can't do that to him.

830
00:48:24,117 --> 00:48:25,284
What, from me?

831
00:48:25,284 --> 00:48:26,911
From anybody.

832
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:31,161
Hmm.

833
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:35,077
We're out
to a call of a lady

834
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:37,409
that's threatening
to commit suicide.

835
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:38,576
The reportee on this
is her husband,

836
00:48:38,576 --> 00:48:39,494
who's at a different location.

837
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:42,077
Apparently,
she's armed herself

838
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:45,077
with a knife and has taken
some anti-depressant drugs.

839
00:48:45,077 --> 00:48:47,911
This is our second time
out to this apartment today.

840
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:48,496
And it looks like

841
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:51,577
she's still out front
in her car here.

842
00:48:51,577 --> 00:48:52,911
The red minivan.

843
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:57,996
Shit.

844
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:01,746
Sharon. Stop it!

845
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:05,121
Did he just try to kick her?

846
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:07,329
- I want to help you.
- No, you don't!

847
00:49:07,329 --> 00:49:08,954
- You gotta help me. Yes, I do.
- You lied to me.

848
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:10,579
I'm not lying to you.

849
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:13,621
Come on, we need you out here.
Come on, come on.

850
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:15,248
- Give me that knife!
- Oh!

851
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:17,248
Back off! Lady...

852
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:19,748
Jesus Christ.

853
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,581
Get your arm
outta there.

854
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:21,914
Bring it out.

855
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:23,081
We still have
the knife under there.

856
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:24,123
Yeah. We're fine.

857
00:49:24,123 --> 00:49:25,581
- Oh, my God.
- You gotta change this.

858
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:27,748
I don't want to see them
justify this shit.

859
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:29,581
She's fine. There's
nothing we can do for that.

860
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:31,498
Just leave
the knife right there.

861
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:36,750
Oh,
look at the doggy!

862
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,666
say he was
caught breeding pit bulls

863
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:40,791
for dog fighting
inside his home.

864
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:43,251
That is messed up.
I really love dogs.

865
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,416
One of my cousin's
friends, Tiara,

866
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,166
she has this dog.

867
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:48,668
His name is Blade.

868
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:51,501
He's a Great Dane.
Oh, my gosh!

869
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:55,001
I think I was a dog
in a previous life.

870
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,003
In fact, I know I was.

871
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:00,085
It's why they love me so much.

872
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:01,918
You're watching
Time Warner Cable News

873
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:03,836
New York 1.

874
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,753
Now an update on last week's
bank robbery in Flushing.

875
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,795
Authorities are still
searching for

876
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:09,335
Constantine Nikas,

877
00:50:09,335 --> 00:50:10,670
suspected of carrying
out the robbery

878
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,295
along with his brother.

879
00:50:12,295 --> 00:50:14,253
Nikolas Nikas was arrested
near the scene

880
00:50:14,253 --> 00:50:16,086
after crashing through
a plate-glass window

881
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:18,295
at the New World Mall.
Today the brothers'

882
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:20,295
grandmother is speaking out
in an exclusive interview

883
00:50:20,295 --> 00:50:21,920
with NY1's Tara Lynn Wagner.

884
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,963
She joins us now from Flushing
with the details.

885
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:25,088
Well,
that's right, Lewis.

886
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,672
In a NY1 exclusive,
Agapia Nikas

887
00:50:27,672 --> 00:50:28,963
describes her complicated

888
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:30,755
relationship with
her grandsons.

889
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:32,255
She took out
a restraining order

890
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:33,423
against Constantine
earlier this year,

891
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:37,088
after she says he threatened
and stalked her.

892
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:39,505
And she blames him for
an altercation with Nikolas

893
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:40,423
that left her
with a broken arm.

894
00:50:41,423 --> 00:50:43,632
I don't want to call him.

895
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:45,423
I don't want to talk with him.

896
00:50:45,423 --> 00:50:46,923
I don't want to, uh...

897
00:50:46,923 --> 00:50:49,798
All because he treats
his brother so badly.

898
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:06,759
What the fuck?

899
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:08,679
Where the fuck am I?

900
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:15,760
Yo,

901
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,637
where you going?

902
00:51:19,635 --> 00:51:20,929
Fuck.

903
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:24,010
Yo, where the fuck am I, man?

904
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,094
Did you do this
to my fucking face?

905
00:51:25,094 --> 00:51:26,594
Shut the fuck up.
Lower your voice.

906
00:51:26,594 --> 00:51:29,510
No. Back the fuck up, man.
Back the fuck up.

907
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,094
- Listen! Stop it!
- Get the fuck off me!

908
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:32,262
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Ow!

909
00:51:32,262 --> 00:51:33,679
Ow, my fucking arm!

910
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:35,679
Ow! My fucking hand
and handcuff!

911
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,137
- Shut up!
- Ow!

912
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:39,304
- Get the fuck off me!
- Stop yelling!

913
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,137
- Shut up!
- My whole fucking body hurts.

914
00:51:42,137 --> 00:51:43,929
Yo, C, can you get some
painkillers, please?

915
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,596
You do
this shit to me, bro?

916
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:46,512
Now! Now!

917
00:51:46,512 --> 00:51:47,847
Did you do
this shit to me?

918
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:49,304
Shut the fuck up.
If you wake the grandma,

919
00:51:49,304 --> 00:51:49,347
I swear to God
I'll fuck you up.

920
00:51:50,346 --> 00:51:51,597
What fucking grandma?

921
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:53,264
You're in an old lady's
house in Rego Park.

922
00:51:53,264 --> 00:51:54,472
- Are you gonna stay quiet?
- How the fuck did I

923
00:51:54,472 --> 00:51:55,931
- get here, bro?
- Calm down.

924
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:57,139
- Calm down.
- Fuck. All right.

925
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:58,514
Get off. I'm calm.

926
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:00,264
- All right. Calm down.
- All right.

927
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:01,766
So get the fuck off.

928
00:52:03,764 --> 00:52:05,016
Thank you.

929
00:52:05,016 --> 00:52:07,431
- Yo, take these.
- What the fuck is that?

930
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:08,931
- What is it?
- Oxys.

931
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:10,474
Take it. Take it.

932
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:11,684
They'll make you feel better.

933
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:14,432
Are you gonna stay calm?

934
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:15,932
Can you leave
us alone, please?

935
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,432
Dude,
why do I have handcuffs?

936
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:18,766
Just go
down to your room.

937
00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:20,349
Shut the door. Shut the door.

938
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:20,351
Close the door!

939
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:23,684
- Fuck!
- I swear to God,

940
00:52:23,684 --> 00:52:24,766
if you wake up
the grandmother,

941
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,934
- I'll fuck you up!
- Yeah, yeah.

942
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,474
I heard you, bro.

943
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:28,934
- God damn it.
- Are you gonna stay calm?

944
00:52:28,934 --> 00:52:31,601
Yeah, yeah, I'm calm.

945
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:32,768
Fuck.

946
00:52:32,768 --> 00:52:34,028
Christ, man.

947
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:48,311
What the fuck is going on?
Why am I in handcuffs?

948
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:50,103
You were handcuffed
to a stretcher in a hospital.

949
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,353
I broke the wrong guy out.

950
00:52:51,353 --> 00:52:52,436
- That's all I know.
- Hospital?

951
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:53,478
Yeah.

952
00:52:53,478 --> 00:52:54,436
There was a cop
outside your room.

953
00:52:54,436 --> 00:52:55,978
- What?
- I fucked up.

954
00:52:55,978 --> 00:52:57,936
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to tell you.

955
00:52:57,936 --> 00:53:01,103
There was a cop outside your
room and you're the wrong guy.

956
00:53:01,103 --> 00:53:02,855
Well, what the fuck
am I going to do?

957
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:04,438
You can do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

958
00:53:04,438 --> 00:53:05,980
What you can't do
is fuck my shit up.

959
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,313
Acting stupid and getting me
thrown out. Okay?

960
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:09,355
All right, well listen.
Get me a phone, man.

961
00:53:09,355 --> 00:53:09,273
I gotta make some phone calls.

962
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,646
I don't have a fucking phone.

963
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,438
Well, go get one
from that fucking girl then.

964
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,193
All right.

965
00:54:01,193 --> 00:54:02,818
We need to go back
to the hospital.

966
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:04,277
Is your brother okay?

967
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:06,110
That's not my brother.
The hospital fucked up.

968
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,110
Who is that upstairs?

969
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,320
I don't know who it is.

970
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,612
The hospital fucked up.
It's not my fault.

971
00:54:10,612 --> 00:54:11,777
Does the car

972
00:54:11,777 --> 00:54:13,028
- in the driveway work?
- Yeah.

973
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:14,028
Do you know
where the keys are?

974
00:54:14,028 --> 00:54:14,197
No.

975
00:54:15,195 --> 00:54:16,277
Well, where could they be?
Can we just go

976
00:54:16,277 --> 00:54:17,278
and look for them quickly?

977
00:54:18,612 --> 00:54:21,362
Hurry up, get some shit on
and go find the keys.

978
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:22,820
Fuck, man.

979
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,945
Don't be confused.

980
00:54:23,945 --> 00:54:25,329
It's just gonna
make it worse for me.

981
00:54:32,322 --> 00:54:33,543
Fuck.

982
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:48,657
Yo, yo!

983
00:54:48,657 --> 00:54:49,782
What?

984
00:54:49,782 --> 00:54:51,282
I'm leaving.
You gotta leave too.

985
00:54:51,282 --> 00:54:52,657
- Let's go.
- Can I get a ride?

986
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:53,782
Yeah. Whatever.

987
00:54:53,782 --> 00:54:55,115
I gotta make
a phone call, too, bro.

988
00:54:55,115 --> 00:54:56,365
- Please.
- Fine, fine.

989
00:54:56,365 --> 00:54:57,449
Just don't say anything stupid
in front of her.

990
00:54:57,449 --> 00:54:58,492
I won't say nothing stupid.

991
00:54:58,492 --> 00:54:59,824
And clean that shit
off your face.

992
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:01,324
What the fuck do you think
I'm trying to do here?

993
00:55:01,324 --> 00:55:02,452
- You're gonna scare her.
- Get me that phone!

994
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:05,719
Fuck, man.

995
00:55:33,494 --> 00:55:34,210
Oh, shit!

996
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:42,150
Oh, it's probably
just some bullshit.

997
00:56:32,543 --> 00:56:34,168
Hey, Ron, it's me.

998
00:56:34,168 --> 00:56:36,793
Listen, I'll explain later.
Are you with Mom right now?

999
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,168
All right, listen.

1000
00:56:38,168 --> 00:56:40,460
Is there anybody else in the
room with you right now?

1001
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,835
Oh, fuck.

1002
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:44,126
Listen, listen, when I get
off the phone with you,

1003
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:45,126
you gotta pretend

1004
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:46,335
like you just got
off the phone

1005
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,795
with one of your friends
or something, all right?

1006
00:56:47,795 --> 00:56:49,710
All right,
it's really important.

1007
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,668
I gotta call you back later
from a different phone.

1008
00:56:51,668 --> 00:56:52,960
I'll explain everything.
All right?

1009
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,545
All right, I love you, bro.

1010
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:55,965
Bye.

1011
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,380
Whoa, whoa.
Why are we going back

1012
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,628
to the hospital for?

1013
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:02,670
I thought that's
where you wanted to go.

1014
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,670
Are you fucking crazy?

1015
00:57:18,963 --> 00:57:19,175
All right.

1016
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:23,215
I'm gonna drop you off
at that White Castle.

1017
00:57:23,215 --> 00:57:24,815
I gotta get something
for my brother, anyway.

1018
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,882
Yo, could you run in and get

1019
00:57:42,882 --> 00:57:44,509
a number 5 six-piece
chicken thing?

1020
00:57:44,509 --> 00:57:46,134
All right.

1021
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:47,842
Get me something too.

1022
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:48,967
I'm starving.

1023
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:50,802
Just a couple sliders, please.

1024
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,175
Go ahead.

1025
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,885
Give me my phone.

1026
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:58,385
- Here.
- No, no, leave that in here.

1027
00:57:58,385 --> 00:57:59,559
I wanna use it.

1028
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:08,969
All right, bro. She's gone.

1029
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:10,844
Let's get the fuck out of
here! Let's fucking book it.

1030
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:12,177
Driving around
in a stolen car?

1031
00:58:12,177 --> 00:58:13,969
Don't be a fucking idiot.

1032
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,637
We're waiting for her here.

1033
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,637
Well, I guess I'm gonna stay
in the car, too, then, man.

1034
00:58:17,637 --> 00:58:19,304
Because you've seen
how it is back there.

1035
00:58:19,304 --> 00:58:20,389
All those fucking cops.

1036
00:58:21,387 --> 00:58:22,679
And there's fucking cops

1037
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:24,846
at my house. I don't think
you understand, bro.

1038
00:58:24,846 --> 00:58:27,304
I just got out
of prison yesterday.

1039
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:28,804
I'm on fucking parole.

1040
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:29,887
I'm fucked.

1041
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:31,304
I'm gonna end up back in jail.

1042
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:33,889
I am not going back to jail!

1043
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:35,972
And these fucking pills
aren't doing shit.

1044
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:40,181
Man, this is all
a bunch of fucking

1045
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,389
bullshit, man!

1046
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:43,514
Shut the fuck up.
I'm trying to think.

1047
00:58:43,514 --> 00:58:44,556
Okay?

1048
00:58:44,556 --> 00:58:45,806
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

1049
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:48,014
I'm trying to fucking
figure out my shit, too.

1050
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:50,847
I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do.

1051
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:52,976
I don't remember half the shit
that went on yesterday.

1052
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:56,016
I don't know if I ended up
in the hospital first.

1053
00:58:56,016 --> 00:58:57,182
Or the precinct first.

1054
00:58:57,182 --> 00:58:59,307
I don't know
if they got my fingerprints.

1055
00:58:59,307 --> 00:59:01,182
I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

1056
00:59:01,182 --> 00:59:02,307
And I don't remember
half of it

1057
00:59:02,307 --> 00:59:04,559
because I was so
goddamned fucked up!

1058
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:10,141
I remember being
dropped off by a bus.

1059
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:12,141
The jail releases me,
the bus drops me off

1060
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:14,726
right in front of
a liquor store on the corner.

1061
00:59:14,726 --> 00:59:16,184
I mean, after doing
two years in jail,

1062
00:59:16,184 --> 00:59:18,643
what the fuck do you think
is gonna happen, man?

1063
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:21,518
I'm gonna want
a fucking drink.

1064
00:59:21,518 --> 00:59:23,018
Right away I'm getting
a bottle of brandy.

1065
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,476
I'm already practically broke,

1066
00:59:24,476 --> 00:59:27,143
with the little money
that was left in my account.

1067
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:28,561
So I call my boy, Caliph.

1068
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:30,228
He comes through
with some more liquor.

1069
00:59:30,228 --> 00:59:31,353
Your boy's home, man.

1070
00:59:31,353 --> 00:59:33,019
And some sticks of Xanax.

1071
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:34,394
My brother!

1072
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:36,894
He takes some sticks.
I take some sticks.

1073
00:59:36,894 --> 00:59:38,811
And by now,
we're all fucked up.

1074
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:41,978
And I'm just feeling so good
that I don't even give a fuck.

1075
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,521
So we both walk over
to his boy Trevor's house.

1076
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:44,896
This guy who has
this hustle going

1077
00:59:45,894 --> 00:59:49,480
where he moves acid
for this guy in the Bronx

1078
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,646
to this other guy
in Long Island.

1079
00:59:50,646 --> 00:59:51,813
But what they do is,

1080
00:59:51,813 --> 00:59:53,230
they skim a couple
of sheets off the top,

1081
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,730
you know, so they could
have some money

1082
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,231
on the side for themselves
before they make the delivery.

1083
00:59:57,231 --> 00:00:04,416
Yo, Bells, Belvis,
how much was that?

1084
01:00:01,188 --> 01:00:03,815
Yo, son, hook me up, son.

1085
01:00:03,815 --> 01:00:05,565
Finish her. You're a
three-minute man anyway.

1086
01:00:05,565 --> 01:00:07,648
Fuck, let me do my thing, man.

1087
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:12,565
So I ride with him
to Long Island,

1088
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:13,690
and I'm thinking
the whole time

1089
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,233
this PO's gonna
read me the riot act,

1090
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:19,148
'cause I'm fucking up already,
but, I mean...

1091
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,567
I'm feeling so great,
and I'm fucked up.

1092
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:22,983
And I just don't give a fuck.
I'm celebrating.

1093
01:00:22,983 --> 01:00:24,317
I'm not gonna spill it.

1094
01:00:24,317 --> 01:00:26,192
Yo, how much
is this shit worth?

1095
01:00:26,192 --> 01:00:28,693
So I'm at the arcade
with Trevor now.

1096
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:31,025
You know, we're doing
our thing, hustling acid.

1097
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:32,693
And, you know,
we take over this place.

1098
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:34,693
Like it's our fucking office.

1099
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:36,900
Once in a while
someone will show up

1100
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,485
and we'll make a sale,
you know.

1101
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:40,402
Make a sale here.
Make a sale there.

1102
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:42,235
Twenty? You know...

1103
01:00:42,235 --> 01:00:43,985
Take that shit
and get high, baby boy.

1104
01:00:43,985 --> 01:00:46,152
A little stronger
than last time, I hope.

1105
01:00:46,152 --> 01:00:46,862
But then,
one of Trevor's friends,

1106
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,403
this clown Donnie walks in.

1107
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:51,652
And he's all fucked up.

1108
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:53,070
And he's talking about

1109
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,362
how he just robbed some
Radio Shack down the street.

1110
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:58,152
Look, check this out.

1111
01:00:58,152 --> 01:00:59,152
At this point,

1112
01:00:59,152 --> 01:01:00,528
the acid's kicking in for me,

1113
01:01:00,528 --> 01:01:04,820
so I can't follow this shit.
I'm having a hard time

1114
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,530
following the story,

1115
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,028
and I'm starting
to freak out a little bit.

1116
01:01:08,028 --> 01:01:09,530
Bam! Right over
his fucking head.

1117
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,239
And then, guess what happens?
The fucking cops show up.

1118
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:13,487
And the next thing I know,

1119
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:15,322
Trevor's grabbing me,
and we just book it into

1120
01:01:15,322 --> 01:01:16,489
the parking lot.

1121
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:17,739
And I just remember thinking
I could run

1122
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:19,655
for, like, 20 miles straight.

1123
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:20,324
It's here, right here.

1124
01:01:22,322 --> 01:01:25,072
So I'm following Trevor,
and it's fucking freezing.

1125
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:26,322
He leads us
into Adventureland,

1126
01:01:26,322 --> 01:01:26,824
this amusement park.

1127
01:01:27,824 --> 01:01:31,489
At this point, I have no idea
what the fuck is going on.

1128
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,157
And then Donnie leads us
into this ride,

1129
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:34,739
and they look for a place
to hide their shit.

1130
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:35,990
But it's fuckin'
dark in there.

1131
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,407
I can't see shit.

1132
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,324
All of a sudden,
they get bagged,

1133
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:40,992
I'm all by myself in the dark.

1134
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:42,867
And literally
the next thing I remember is,

1135
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:46,659
I'm fucking running down
some random street.

1136
01:01:46,659 --> 01:01:48,992
And I just see a fucking cab.

1137
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:51,159
And I hail it,
and I just get in.

1138
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:53,409
And this driver,
he just kept talking to me

1139
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,992
and talking to me, and
I'm fucking tripping balls.

1140
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:57,659
And I'm telling him,
"Please, please.

1141
01:01:57,659 --> 01:01:58,492
"Just give me
some peace and quiet,

1142
01:01:58,492 --> 01:01:59,994
"or I'm going to throw up."

1143
01:01:59,994 --> 01:02:02,202
If you're going to throw up,
you give me my money right now

1144
01:02:02,202 --> 01:02:03,659
and you get out of this car.

1145
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:04,867
And I told the driver,

1146
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:06,661
"Don't worry.
I'm going to go in the house,

1147
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:08,161
"I'll get the money
from my bag."

1148
01:02:08,161 --> 01:02:10,202
I just got out of jail today,
man. I don't have shit.

1149
01:02:10,202 --> 01:02:13,661
As soon as he hears the word
"jail," he fuckin' freaks.

1150
01:02:13,661 --> 01:02:15,036
Talking about, "Oh,
I'm not getting ripped off

1151
01:02:15,036 --> 01:02:16,536
"by one of you punks again."

1152
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:18,744
- I am not getting fucked over!
- And he just fucking

1153
01:02:18,744 --> 01:02:20,163
steps on the gas,

1154
01:02:20,163 --> 01:02:22,329
and that was it.
He just takes off.

1155
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:24,579
I'm gonna pay you. My mother's
gonna pay you. She has money.

1156
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:25,996
I'm going to the police, okay!

1157
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:29,204
Man, I heard the word
"cops," and I lose it.

1158
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:31,038
I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

1159
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,829
- Pull over. Fuck this.
- You are crazy!

1160
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:34,581
I'm not going
back to jail, man.

1161
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:37,496
I'm not going back to jail.
God damn it!

1162
01:02:37,496 --> 01:02:38,664
So I happen to get
one of the doors opened

1163
01:02:38,664 --> 01:02:40,248
before he locked them all.

1164
01:02:40,248 --> 01:02:42,039
This guy's crazy.
He's fucking driving.

1165
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:43,831
He's speeding down the road,

1166
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:46,039
30, 40 miles an hour.

1167
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,331
And I know we're getting

1168
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,706
closer and closer
to the precinct.

1169
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:50,831
I know where my local
precinct is. It's not far.

1170
01:02:50,831 --> 01:02:53,248
And I am not
going back to jail.

1171
01:02:53,248 --> 01:02:56,668
So I just looked down at
the pavement and just jump.

1172
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,375
And now look
at my fucking face!

1173
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:03,710
I can't go walk around
looking like this.

1174
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,378
Yo. Yo, you listening to me?

1175
01:03:10,376 --> 01:03:12,668
Yo, you fucking hear me?

1176
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:14,545
Yo.

1177
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:19,501
Fucking serious? Hello?

1178
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:21,670
Hello!

1179
01:03:23,668 --> 01:03:25,335
Tell you what I think.

1180
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:26,878
I'm gonna drive us
out there right now,

1181
01:03:26,878 --> 01:03:28,668
gonna go through the ride,
and we split what we find.

1182
01:03:28,668 --> 01:03:28,711
All right?

1183
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,170
What, to Adventurers?
Right now?

1184
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,672
Yes.

1185
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,170
Are you fucking serious?

1186
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,586
I should be in a fucking bed
somewhere right now.

1187
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:42,170
You have nowhere to go.
You have no plan.

1188
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,005
And she's coming right now.

1189
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:55,505
Did you see all the activity

1190
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:57,172
outside the hospital
when we drove past?

1191
01:03:57,172 --> 01:03:58,755
Yeah, the police?

1192
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:00,005
Yeah. So I called over there,

1193
01:04:00,005 --> 01:04:02,172
and there's been
a police incident.

1194
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,340
They're not going to discharge
anyone for an hour and a half.

1195
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,007
So what's going to happen
with your brother?

1196
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:06,673
I don't know.
It's fuckin' nightmare.

1197
01:04:07,672 --> 01:04:09,007
I'm kinda fucked.

1198
01:04:09,007 --> 01:04:10,590
So I want to drop him off
back at home,

1199
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,550
then come back
to the hospital afterwards.

1200
01:04:14,548 --> 01:04:15,844
So I'm gonna drop you off
back at home, right?

1201
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,509
Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

1202
01:04:21,507 --> 01:04:23,510
Yeah, drive me home.

1203
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:12,429
Where am I going?

1204
01:05:12,429 --> 01:05:13,597
Yeah, just right up here.

1205
01:05:13,597 --> 01:05:14,681
Just pull up
around back right here.

1206
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:17,722
Right here?

1207
01:05:17,722 --> 01:05:18,681
Yeah, just pull up
around back.

1208
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,014
I don't want to go
around front

1209
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:21,764
because then the dogs
are going to start barking

1210
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:23,271
and wake everybody up
and stuff. So...

1211
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:34,269
Get out for a second.
I need to talk to her.

1212
01:05:45,766 --> 01:05:48,016
You know what? Tonight,
it's fucked up as it is.

1213
01:05:48,016 --> 01:05:49,268
I just think...

1214
01:05:51,768 --> 01:05:52,601
I think something
very important is happening,

1215
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,226
and it's deeply connected
to my purpose.

1216
01:05:55,226 --> 01:05:56,434
And I think that

1217
01:05:56,434 --> 01:05:59,436
you are somehow
connected to it as well.

1218
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:01,559
I mean, do you feel me at all?

1219
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,601
Or do I just sound
like a total faggot?

1220
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:06,606
No, I feel you. I understand.

1221
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:13,728
Okay, I'm gonna go take a shit
in that guy's house.

1222
01:06:13,728 --> 01:06:16,436
And we'll try the hospital
again in a minute.

1223
01:06:16,436 --> 01:06:18,907
- Just wait here for me, okay?
- All right.

1224
01:06:30,896 --> 01:06:33,605
We can cut
right through here.

1225
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:54,233
Oh, fuck. Ow!

1226
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:57,106
Ow, my fucking shoulder!

1227
01:06:57,106 --> 01:06:59,690
Power with your legs.
Don't use your arms.

1228
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:02,900
- Oh, fuck. Shit, man.
- Shut the fuck up!

1229
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,233
I can't do it, man.

1230
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:05,608
Tell me where it is.
I'll be right back.

1231
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:06,733
I'm not telling you
where it is.

1232
01:07:06,733 --> 01:07:08,025
You can wait by the car.

1233
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:09,692
That's my ride
as well as yours.

1234
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,858
No, no, no way.
We find another way

1235
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:12,025
around or something.

1236
01:07:12,025 --> 01:07:12,527
If I have to come back
over there,

1237
01:07:13,527 --> 01:07:15,275
I'm gonna kick
the living shit out of you.

1238
01:07:15,275 --> 01:07:16,900
You keep pushing me, bro,
and I'm gonna

1239
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,275
forget how fucked up
my shoulder is.

1240
01:07:19,275 --> 01:07:21,027
Motherfucker.

1241
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,695
You gotta help me over, bro.

1242
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:34,860
Come on.

1243
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,695
Just boost me up.

1244
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:37,530
Go.

1245
01:07:38,528 --> 01:07:39,530
There we go.

1246
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:41,739
Go.

1247
01:07:44,737 --> 01:07:46,239
I'm good.

1248
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,530
Oh!

1249
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,572
Fuck me, bro!

1250
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,114
Oh, shit!

1251
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,280
Fuck!

1252
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:57,887
Here we go.

1253
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:23,699
All right, you feel
this track right here?

1254
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:24,909
- Yes.
- Follow it.

1255
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:27,701
Um...

1256
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:30,702
Yo, check this coffin.

1257
01:08:32,699 --> 01:08:33,784
Where?

1258
01:08:33,784 --> 01:08:36,037
Everywhere.
Behind it, under it.

1259
01:08:39,034 --> 01:08:40,202
There's
nothing here, man.

1260
01:08:40,202 --> 01:08:42,244
Try lifting the lid up.

1261
01:08:43,243 --> 01:08:44,743
This is
fucking bolted down.

1262
01:08:44,743 --> 01:08:46,284
Look, I'm not gonna spend
all night looking through

1263
01:08:46,284 --> 01:08:48,244
everything single thing in
here, so think, think harder.

1264
01:08:48,244 --> 01:08:49,536
All right. I'm trying
to fucking think, bro!

1265
01:08:49,536 --> 01:08:52,036
It was fucking dark,
like it is now.

1266
01:08:52,036 --> 01:08:53,369
It's gotta be farther,
let's go father.

1267
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:54,537
Come on.

1268
01:08:54,537 --> 01:08:55,542
Fuck.

1269
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:02,953
Right. Got it.

1270
01:09:02,953 --> 01:09:05,203
This Egyptian shit.

1271
01:09:05,203 --> 01:09:07,954
I don't know.
Maybe this tombstone, man.

1272
01:09:07,954 --> 01:09:09,086
I think they stashed it here.

1273
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:17,038
- Oh, shit!
- You got it?

1274
01:09:17,038 --> 01:09:20,704
Yes! Nah,
I found the fucking acid.

1275
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:21,872
I don't care
about the acid.

1276
01:09:21,872 --> 01:09:23,038
Are you fucking stupid?

1277
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,288
Do you know how much
this shit is worth?

1278
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:25,625
Find the money.

1279
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,207
Do you recognize any of this?

1280
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,082
I told you, man.
I was fucked up.

1281
01:09:31,082 --> 01:09:32,289
The cops came in quick.

1282
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:34,377
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!

1283
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:41,042
Y'all need to come out.

1284
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,792
Stop fucking with me
right now.

1285
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:47,880
I already called the cops.

1286
01:09:52,876 --> 01:09:54,876
Yo!

1287
01:09:54,876 --> 01:09:55,918
Stop playin'.

1288
01:09:56,917 --> 01:09:59,257
Y'all need
to come out right now.

1289
01:10:05,252 --> 01:10:06,253
If I find you,

1290
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:08,724
you gonna get
your assed kicked.

1291
01:10:21,712 --> 01:10:23,713
I'm not fucking around.

1292
01:10:24,712 --> 01:10:25,969
Show your face.

1293
01:10:31,963 --> 01:10:32,631
Hey!

1294
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,047
Oh, fuck!

1295
01:10:37,046 --> 01:10:38,632
Shit. Fuck! Ow!

1296
01:10:40,631 --> 01:10:42,797
Hey! Calm down!

1297
01:10:42,797 --> 01:10:44,215
Hey!

1298
01:10:44,215 --> 01:10:45,965
- Ow. Fuck!
- Hey!

1299
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:49,966
I got beat up!
I'm the victim here, man.

1300
01:10:51,966 --> 01:10:52,551
Oh, shit.

1301
01:10:54,548 --> 01:10:55,923
Where's your friend?

1302
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:58,881
- I don't got no friend.
- I saw you on the monitor!

1303
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:01,091
There's cameras here, okay?

1304
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:03,966
I got beat up. I'm the victim.
Look at me, man.

1305
01:11:03,966 --> 01:11:05,384
Oh, come on, bro.

1306
01:11:05,384 --> 01:11:06,301
I'm gonna show
your friend now, huh?

1307
01:11:07,301 --> 01:11:08,882
I'm not trying
to give you no problems, man.

1308
01:11:08,882 --> 01:11:09,925
All right.

1309
01:11:09,925 --> 01:11:10,301
Let's wait for your boy
to come out.

1310
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,384
Just let me go.
You will never see

1311
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:13,717
my face again, I promise.

1312
01:11:13,717 --> 01:11:15,051
Let's wait for your boy
to come out now.

1313
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:16,759
Please, man. Come on, bro.

1314
01:11:16,759 --> 01:11:17,890
Shut the fuck up.

1315
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:25,974
There he goes.

1316
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:31,929
Hey!

1317
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,220
Hey!

1318
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,430
Yo!

1319
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:49,387
Oh, shit!

1320
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:51,637
Come on! Come on!

1321
01:11:51,637 --> 01:11:54,055
Get me the fuck outta here!

1322
01:11:54,055 --> 01:11:55,637
Yo! Yo!

1323
01:11:55,637 --> 01:11:57,055
Open the door!

1324
01:11:58,055 --> 01:11:59,639
Yo, cut me the fuck
out of these things, man.

1325
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:01,895
There's got to be
scissors somewhere.

1326
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,057
Let me see those things.

1327
01:12:11,056 --> 01:12:11,560
Shit.

1328
01:12:15,557 --> 01:12:16,934
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

1329
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:38,643
All right,
let's leave him here.

1330
01:12:38,643 --> 01:12:39,768
Keep looking.

1331
01:12:39,768 --> 01:12:40,935
Go find it.

1332
01:12:40,935 --> 01:12:42,393
I want to be in
and out of here.

1333
01:12:42,393 --> 01:12:43,894
Damn you fucked him up.

1334
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:46,101
I want to be in and out,
all right? In and out!

1335
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,060
Yo, does any of this
black light shit ring a bell?

1336
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,103
I don't know, man.

1337
01:12:52,103 --> 01:12:53,895
Just look around.
Look under shit.

1338
01:12:53,895 --> 01:12:55,978
Look behind shit,
like I'm doing.

1339
01:12:55,978 --> 01:12:57,103
The cops came in.

1340
01:12:57,103 --> 01:12:59,729
They stashed it
really quick, man.

1341
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:03,479
- What about the boat thing?
- The what?

1342
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,479
The boat. Did you look
through the boat?

1343
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:07,229
Nah, not yet.

1344
01:13:26,273 --> 01:13:28,149
Hello!

1345
01:13:30,398 --> 01:13:33,568
Hello! Nassau County Police.
Anybody in there?

1346
01:13:35,565 --> 01:13:37,242
Fuck! Fuck!

1347
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:48,404
Nassau County Police!

1348
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,152
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1349
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,609
Shit, man.

1350
01:13:55,609 --> 01:13:56,755
Take his shoes off!

1351
01:14:16,737 --> 01:14:19,069
Go look for a hiding spot.
Don't leave the ride.

1352
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:20,737
Hold on, hold on.

1353
01:14:20,737 --> 01:14:22,320
This motherfucker's
not gonna remember shit

1354
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,404
when he wakes up.

1355
01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:24,632
Open the fucking mouth.

1356
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:45,907
Oh, there you are.

1357
01:14:45,907 --> 01:14:47,155
What happened?
We were yelling at the gate.

1358
01:14:47,155 --> 01:14:48,405
Sorry, man,
I couldn't hear anything.

1359
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:49,328
He's inside here.

1360
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,118
Watch out
for the rail.

1361
01:14:58,115 --> 01:14:59,908
- He's just here.
- Oh, shit.

1362
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:01,408
What happened to him?

1363
01:15:01,408 --> 01:15:02,492
I don't know.

1364
01:15:02,492 --> 01:15:03,617
I just heard
a ton of noise outside.

1365
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:04,742
I just walked in here,

1366
01:15:04,742 --> 01:15:05,824
and he's just
layin' there like this...

1367
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:06,783
Unconscious, I guess.

1368
01:15:06,783 --> 01:15:08,242
What happened
to the other one?

1369
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:09,493
- Could we get a bus for a...
- The other one...

1370
01:15:09,493 --> 01:15:10,908
lacerations to the face.

1371
01:15:10,908 --> 01:15:12,743
As soon as I turned the lights
on, everybody ran off.

1372
01:15:12,743 --> 01:15:14,576
Is he still in the park?

1373
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:15,909
Maybe. I don't know.

1374
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:16,078
You have an ETA?

1375
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:18,284
I'm gonna
need you to turn all

1376
01:15:18,284 --> 01:15:19,951
- the lights on in the park.
- Copy.

1377
01:15:19,951 --> 01:15:22,493
Uh... Yeah, just give me
a couple of minutes.

1378
01:15:38,912 --> 01:15:40,162
Hold on.

1379
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:41,244
Let me call you back, hold on.

1380
01:15:41,244 --> 01:15:43,247
'Cause I just
peeped something.

1381
01:16:00,581 --> 01:16:01,414
Yo, yo, yo.

1382
01:16:02,413 --> 01:16:05,288
Stop! Stop! Turn around.

1383
01:16:05,288 --> 01:16:06,752
Turn around.

1384
01:16:11,748 --> 01:16:15,582
Nice strong pulse.
He has a good chest rise.

1385
01:16:15,582 --> 01:16:17,082
He's moving good oxygen.

1386
01:16:17,082 --> 01:16:19,998
Those whacks are pretty nasty
on his forehead though.

1387
01:16:19,998 --> 01:16:23,582
Hey, bud. Hey. Hey.
What's going on, man? Hey.

1388
01:16:23,582 --> 01:16:26,083
You awake? Hello. Hello.

1389
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:32,082
He's a little agitated.
Hold on. Hold on to him.

1390
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:33,250
Hey, man, it's all right.

1391
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,752
It's all right.
Relax. Relax. Relax.

1392
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:39,292
There goes that drug use, huh?

1393
01:16:41,585 --> 01:16:43,127
Just hold
on to his legs.

1394
01:16:43,127 --> 01:16:44,835
Make sure you got his legs.

1395
01:16:44,835 --> 01:16:46,418
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1396
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:47,586
- I'm gonna cuff him.
- Yeah, yeah.

1397
01:16:47,586 --> 01:16:48,586
Let's restrain him.

1398
01:16:49,752 --> 01:16:52,087
Relax,
you're gonna be all right.

1399
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:54,252
Relax.
All right, I got his arms.

1400
01:16:54,252 --> 01:16:55,461
You get under.

1401
01:16:55,461 --> 01:16:58,421
Take your time.
One. Two. Three.

1402
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:02,090
All right, let's put him
on a stretcher.

1403
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:07,921
All right.

1404
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:09,003
Get off of me!

1405
01:17:09,003 --> 01:17:10,171
Why are you still
holding me, sir?

1406
01:17:10,171 --> 01:17:11,421
Get off!

1407
01:17:12,421 --> 01:17:15,171
Get off! Get off of me!

1408
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:16,837
Wait, I just
explained myself to you.

1409
01:17:16,837 --> 01:17:16,965
I didn't have to do that.

1410
01:17:17,963 --> 01:17:19,088
You're not
making any sense.

1411
01:17:22,756 --> 01:17:23,466
This is the girl.

1412
01:17:26,465 --> 01:17:27,757
Yo!

1413
01:17:28,756 --> 01:17:30,967
Is this the one
that was running around?

1414
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:35,673
Nah,
it wasn't a girl, bro.

1415
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:37,091
I don't know who that is.

1416
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:38,757
Look me at,
don't look at him.

1417
01:17:38,757 --> 01:17:40,757
Look at me. How old are you?

1418
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:42,925
- I'm 16.
- Where's your ID?

1419
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:44,007
What are you doing here?

1420
01:17:44,007 --> 01:17:45,591
You don't want...
You don't know, and

1421
01:17:45,591 --> 01:17:48,634
you don't want to talk to me?
Come on. You're outta here.

1422
01:17:48,634 --> 01:17:50,802
I don't got time
for this shit.

1423
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:53,967
We'll find somebody
that'll talk to us

1424
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:55,761
and tell you why
you're here, all right?

1425
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,851
Get her outta here.
I'll start her 61.

1426
01:18:09,844 --> 01:18:11,426
Elmhurst, can I help you?

1427
01:18:11,426 --> 01:18:13,636
Yeah. I'm just
looking for a patient

1428
01:18:13,636 --> 01:18:14,761
who's currently
in the hospital.

1429
01:18:14,761 --> 01:18:16,177
I'm just checking
to see if he's okay.

1430
01:18:16,177 --> 01:18:17,345
Name, please.

1431
01:18:17,345 --> 01:18:19,470
Nikolas. Nikolas Nikas.

1432
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:21,470
N-I-K-A-S.

1433
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:24,262
N-I-K-A-S.

1434
01:18:24,262 --> 01:18:26,011
Do you have a floor
or wing or something?

1435
01:18:26,011 --> 01:18:28,095
No. No, I don't know anything.

1436
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,949
All right, please hold.

1437
01:18:48,931 --> 01:18:50,305
Hello?

1438
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:51,430
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1439
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:53,265
I'm unable to release
any information

1440
01:18:53,265 --> 01:18:54,306
regarding that inmate.

1441
01:18:54,306 --> 01:18:56,099
Why not? I'm a family member.

1442
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:57,807
Like I said, I'm not allowed

1443
01:18:57,807 --> 01:19:00,649
to release or to disclose
any information about...

1444
01:19:09,641 --> 01:19:09,855
Yo!

1445
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,184
- Yo!
- Yeah.

1446
01:19:17,184 --> 01:19:17,853
We're leavin'.

1447
01:19:18,851 --> 01:19:21,692
Yo, are we good, man?
Are they gone?

1448
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:28,844
Yo, wait up!

1449
01:20:02,813 --> 01:20:04,523
Let me in.

1450
01:20:04,523 --> 01:20:05,605
You have the acid?

1451
01:20:05,605 --> 01:20:06,149
Yeah.

1452
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:08,363
Get in the back.

1453
01:20:15,356 --> 01:20:15,815
I gotta get
to a fucking phone, man.

1454
01:20:16,814 --> 01:20:18,274
I gotta warn my family.

1455
01:20:18,274 --> 01:20:19,940
If they call that fucking
stupid girl's number back...

1456
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,483
If she's with the cops,

1457
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,940
then I'm fucked, bro.

1458
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,608
They might trick my mom
into saying something stupid,

1459
01:20:24,608 --> 01:20:27,609
like I...
Like I called her earlier.

1460
01:20:28,608 --> 01:20:29,774
Fuck, man.

1461
01:20:29,774 --> 01:20:29,819
Lay down.

1462
01:20:31,817 --> 01:20:33,443
We're going to his house.

1463
01:20:33,443 --> 01:20:36,689
Lay down.
Make yourself invisible.

1464
01:22:14,618 --> 01:22:17,631
- What apartment?
- 12B.

1465
01:22:30,621 --> 01:22:31,787
Hello?

1466
01:22:37,538 --> 01:22:38,872
Hello?

1467
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:04,125
Hey.

1468
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,042
Come here.

1469
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:10,042
Smell the coat.
Smell the coal.

1470
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:11,458
Smell that. Go on.

1471
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:13,792
You smell it? You smell it?

1472
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,377
Come here, come here.

1473
01:23:16,376 --> 01:23:17,460
Come on.

1474
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:38,837
getting $46 million

1475
01:23:38,837 --> 01:23:41,132
in funding for
upgraded infrastructure.

1476
01:23:45,128 --> 01:23:48,212
35,000 feet of new sewers,
water mains, and sidewalks.

1477
01:23:48,212 --> 01:23:50,297
Shit, that's what
I'm talking about.

1478
01:23:52,296 --> 01:23:54,130
Man, this is a nice
fucking place.

1479
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,837
I wish I had
a fucking place like this.

1480
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:07,547
How much money
can you get for this

1481
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:09,547
- right now, tonight?
- What?

1482
01:24:09,547 --> 01:24:11,797
For the acid. Who can you call
to get some money for this

1483
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:12,965
right now tonight?

1484
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,631
I want to move it right now.

1485
01:24:14,631 --> 01:24:15,797
That doesn't belong to me.

1486
01:24:15,797 --> 01:24:17,466
That belongs
to my boy, Caliph.

1487
01:24:17,466 --> 01:24:19,298
Well, then he can
pay me for it.

1488
01:24:19,298 --> 01:24:20,631
Fuck that, man.
I'm the one who found it.

1489
01:24:20,631 --> 01:24:21,841
Not you.

1490
01:24:21,841 --> 01:24:23,175
You wouldn't have found
anything without me.

1491
01:24:23,175 --> 01:24:25,634
You were handcuffed
to a bed in a hospital.

1492
01:24:25,634 --> 01:24:26,800
What do you think
I'm doing this for?

1493
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,175
You think I'm doing this
for charity?

1494
01:24:28,175 --> 01:24:31,841
All right. You're right.
You got a point. I hear you.

1495
01:24:31,841 --> 01:24:33,301
Listen. My boy
will hook you up.

1496
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:34,635
He'll throw some
money your way.

1497
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:35,966
But, my point is,

1498
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:37,216
it's not up to me.
I gotta call him, all right?

1499
01:24:37,216 --> 01:24:38,301
- It's not up to me.
- You're right.

1500
01:24:38,301 --> 01:24:39,551
It's not up to you.

1501
01:24:39,551 --> 01:24:41,967
So get on the phone
and call him right now.

1502
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:42,969
Plug the phone in. Charge it.

1503
01:24:43,967 --> 01:24:44,842
And give me a minute.

1504
01:24:44,842 --> 01:24:45,885
It doesn't need to be charged.

1505
01:24:45,885 --> 01:24:46,967
I want to relax
for a minute, man.

1506
01:24:46,967 --> 01:24:48,176
It's been a long
fucking night, you know.

1507
01:24:48,176 --> 01:24:49,510
I don't give a fuck
if you want to relax.

1508
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,886
You gotta get on the phone
right now, and you gotta

1509
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:52,302
make sure it's plugged
into the wall 'cause

1510
01:24:52,302 --> 01:24:53,801
- otherwise it doesn't work.
- Give me a minute, bro.

1511
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:54,559
Goddamn.

1512
01:25:00,552 --> 01:25:02,306
Call him now.

1513
01:25:05,304 --> 01:25:07,386
A Bronx man is
facing animal cruelty charges.

1514
01:25:07,386 --> 01:25:09,970
Officials say an anonymous tip
about emaciated dogs prompted

1515
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:12,137
an investigation
by law enforcement.

1516
01:25:12,137 --> 01:25:13,639
They will soon
be available for adoption.

1517
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:14,805
Now an update

1518
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:16,305
on last week's
bank robbery in Flushing.

1519
01:25:16,305 --> 01:25:17,805
Authorities are still
searching for

1520
01:25:17,805 --> 01:25:20,305
Constantine Nikas, suspected
of carrying out the robbery

1521
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:22,305
along with his brother.

1522
01:25:22,305 --> 01:25:23,722
Nikolas Nikas was arrested
near the scene

1523
01:25:23,722 --> 01:25:25,640
after crashing through
a plate-glass window

1524
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,139
at the New World Mall.

1525
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:28,890
He's currently being held
at the Queens Detention Center

1526
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:29,515
awaiting a court appearance.

1527
01:25:30,514 --> 01:25:32,224
Today the brothers'
grandmother is speaking out...

1528
01:25:32,224 --> 01:25:34,849
So how much time
are you facing?

1529
01:25:34,849 --> 01:25:37,891
She joins us now from Flushing
with the details.

1530
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,890
Come on, man, look at me.

1531
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:43,475
one exclusive,
Agapia Nikas...

1532
01:25:43,475 --> 01:25:46,140
I don't care.
I don't give a fuck.

1533
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,682
I know your situation
can't be worse than mine.

1534
01:25:49,682 --> 01:25:50,850
Everybody goes through shit.

1535
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,557
I'm the last one to judge.

1536
01:25:53,557 --> 01:25:55,975
She blames him for
an altercation with Nikolas

1537
01:25:55,975 --> 01:25:58,018
that left her
with a broken arm.

1538
01:25:58,018 --> 01:26:00,020
You ever do time before?

1539
01:26:03,018 --> 01:26:04,351
Fucking kidding me?

1540
01:26:04,351 --> 01:26:05,894
Just asking you
a question.

1541
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:08,476
Why you gotta be such
a fuckin' little prick

1542
01:26:09,475 --> 01:26:10,644
all the time, man?

1543
01:26:10,644 --> 01:26:11,726
Look at you.
Look at you.

1544
01:26:11,726 --> 01:26:12,728
You're drunk as shit,

1545
01:26:12,728 --> 01:26:13,895
and now you wanna
get real with me?

1546
01:26:13,895 --> 01:26:15,353
Don't fucking
flatter yourself, bro.

1547
01:26:15,353 --> 01:26:16,560
Huh?

1548
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,020
I'm not trying
to get real with you.

1549
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,311
You know what?
I'm fucking real.

1550
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:21,520
Fuck.

1551
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,561
I'm trying to
talk to you, all right?

1552
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:25,145
Go fuck yourself, man.

1553
01:26:25,145 --> 01:26:25,479
You think
you're better than me.

1554
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:28,063
I am better than you.

1555
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:30,395
You're an ignorant fuck, bro.

1556
01:26:30,395 --> 01:26:32,814
No one's better than
any next man, all right?

1557
01:26:32,814 --> 01:26:34,063
You don't know me from Adam.

1558
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:35,729
The second you got here,
you went to the booze

1559
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:37,146
and you got fucked up.
But that's fine.

1560
01:26:37,146 --> 01:26:38,688
- So the fuck what?
- So that's who, that's who...

1561
01:26:38,688 --> 01:26:40,146
That's just who you are.
You're a fuckup.

1562
01:26:40,146 --> 01:26:42,230
That's it. I don't care.
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

1563
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,146
You shouldn't give a shit.
Who gives a shit?

1564
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:45,689
I... I definitely
don't give a shit.

1565
01:26:45,689 --> 01:26:46,855
Look. Losers like you
are incapable

1566
01:26:46,855 --> 01:26:48,356
of taking care of themselves.

1567
01:26:48,356 --> 01:26:50,898
You're either leeching off
mommy or leeching off welfare

1568
01:26:50,898 --> 01:26:52,564
or living off
the government in jail.

1569
01:26:52,564 --> 01:26:53,856
That's you!

1570
01:26:53,856 --> 01:26:55,815
You don't know the first thing
about me, bro.

1571
01:26:55,815 --> 01:26:57,398
What's to know?
What's to know?

1572
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:59,358
You serve absolutely
no function whatsoever.

1573
01:26:59,358 --> 01:27:00,024
It's pathetic.

1574
01:27:01,024 --> 01:27:05,690
I probably made more money
in the last two years

1575
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:07,733
than you did in
your whole fucking life, man.

1576
01:27:07,733 --> 01:27:09,149
Let's see, man, a couple

1577
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:11,067
of years from now,
you ever seen me driving by

1578
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:12,567
in my fucking Lambo.

1579
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:14,068
You're gonna put
your fuckin' foot

1580
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:14,735
so far up your mouth, bro.

1581
01:27:16,734 --> 01:27:18,984
You don't know what I'm
talking about at all.

1582
01:27:21,652 --> 01:27:22,654
'Bout fuckin' time.

1583
01:27:31,069 --> 01:27:31,863
Hello.

1584
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,153
Hello.

1585
01:27:35,153 --> 01:27:35,529
Yo, it's Caliph. Buzz me up.

1586
01:27:37,528 --> 01:27:39,069
All right.
I'm buzzing you up right now.

1587
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:47,904
Yo, come on. Get in, man.

1588
01:27:47,904 --> 01:27:49,570
What the fuck happened
to your face, nigga?

1589
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,488
- I told you it was fucked up.
- You didn't tell me it was

1590
01:27:51,488 --> 01:27:52,904
- like this.
- It is. It is.

1591
01:27:52,904 --> 01:27:54,570
Aw, I can't even fuckin'
look at you, man.

1592
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:55,988
It's disgusting.

1593
01:27:55,988 --> 01:27:57,822
Then don't look at me.
I don't know what to tell you.

1594
01:27:57,822 --> 01:27:59,322
Where's the bottle?

1595
01:27:59,322 --> 01:28:00,697
It's in
this room with this fucker.

1596
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:02,197
What are you whispering about?

1597
01:28:02,197 --> 01:28:04,655
Listen. Listen. This guy's
fuckin' shot up, all right?

1598
01:28:04,655 --> 01:28:05,738
I just want to
get this shit over with.

1599
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:06,492
Man, fuck this shit.

1600
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:10,907
- Yo, what's up?
- Shut the door!

1601
01:28:10,907 --> 01:28:12,323
What the fuck! You didn't
tell me there was a fucking

1602
01:28:12,323 --> 01:28:13,573
dog in there.

1603
01:28:13,573 --> 01:28:15,073
Fucking forgot about that,
man. That's my bad.

1604
01:28:15,073 --> 01:28:16,490
What the fuck!

1605
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,657
How much did
you bring?

1606
01:28:17,657 --> 01:28:19,323
Calm the fuck down.

1607
01:28:19,323 --> 01:28:21,073
How much
did you bring?

1608
01:28:21,073 --> 01:28:22,990
I thought we were gonna
talk about this shit first,

1609
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,199
and then decide.

1610
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:25,658
So you brought nothing.

1611
01:28:25,658 --> 01:28:27,658
I need to know what the fuck
I'm payin' for.

1612
01:28:27,658 --> 01:28:28,908
Is this guy serious?

1613
01:28:28,908 --> 01:28:30,242
Yeah,
I'm very serious.

1614
01:28:30,242 --> 01:28:31,701
I could've run with
my own fucking car

1615
01:28:31,701 --> 01:28:33,324
and got the shit
the other day myself.

1616
01:28:33,324 --> 01:28:35,826
All right, both of you
get out. We're done.

1617
01:28:37,201 --> 01:28:38,702
Yo. Just give him
whatever you got,

1618
01:28:38,702 --> 01:28:40,409
and let's get the fuck
outta here.

1619
01:28:40,409 --> 01:28:42,408
I'm gonna go get $1,000
from the ATM

1620
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:43,659
and bring it right back.

1621
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:46,327
I want 15,000, not 1,000.

1622
01:28:46,327 --> 01:28:48,159
How am I gonna get 15,000
from an ATM,

1623
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:49,536
you crazy motherfucker?

1624
01:28:49,536 --> 01:28:51,202
This conversation's
over. You can leave now.

1625
01:28:51,202 --> 01:28:51,328
- Both of you.
- Don't give him shit.

1626
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,577
How 'bout we do this?

1627
01:28:53,577 --> 01:28:55,577
I'll go to the ATM right now,

1628
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:58,537
and I'm gonna take out $1,000
times three.

1629
01:28:58,537 --> 01:28:59,744
- Three Gs for you...
- No.

1630
01:28:59,744 --> 01:29:00,328
From the ATM in 30 minutes.

1631
01:29:01,328 --> 01:29:02,662
No. Not good enough!

1632
01:29:02,662 --> 01:29:05,703
All right. I'm gonna go
to the motherfuckin' bank.

1633
01:29:05,703 --> 01:29:07,203
It's gonna take me
about three hours

1634
01:29:07,203 --> 01:29:09,162
to get you the 15 Gs.

1635
01:29:09,162 --> 01:29:10,912
You want to sit here
and wait here like a dick?

1636
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,997
Yeah.

1637
01:29:12,997 --> 01:29:15,038
Okay, great. Fine.

1638
01:29:16,037 --> 01:29:16,913
Great.

1639
01:29:17,912 --> 01:29:19,331
That guy's full of fuckin'
shit. He's an asshole.

1640
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:21,663
You see what the fuck
I've been dealin' with

1641
01:29:21,663 --> 01:29:24,081
- all fuckin' night?
- Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1642
01:29:24,081 --> 01:29:25,372
I'm gonna fuckin'
go right now.

1643
01:29:25,372 --> 01:29:27,207
I'll be back at 9:30.

1644
01:29:28,206 --> 01:29:30,206
Keep your eye on him,
all right?

1645
01:29:30,206 --> 01:29:31,707
I'm gonna go to the BX.

1646
01:29:31,707 --> 01:29:33,372
I'm gonna get with Tasha.

1647
01:29:33,372 --> 01:29:35,164
And then I'll be back.

1648
01:29:35,164 --> 01:29:36,207
That's what I'm talking about.

1649
01:29:36,207 --> 01:29:37,666
Hold him
the fuck down.

1650
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,256
Yeah. I'll see you, all right?

1651
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:51,003
Yo!

1652
01:29:55,167 --> 01:29:56,835
Yo!

1653
01:29:56,835 --> 01:29:58,087
What?

1654
01:30:01,085 --> 01:30:01,506
What are you doing?

1655
01:30:06,502 --> 01:30:07,711
I told you. I'm done.

1656
01:30:07,711 --> 01:30:09,335
He's coming back
with the money, bro.

1657
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:10,585
Get off. I'm leaving.

1658
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:12,377
No, we're waiting.
We're fucking waiting.

1659
01:30:12,377 --> 01:30:13,921
Waiting for what?

1660
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,377
We're fuckin' waiting!

1661
01:30:18,377 --> 01:30:20,880
I'm not letting you leave
with that fuckin' bottle, man.

1662
01:30:22,877 --> 01:30:24,752
Fuckin' let go of this shit.

1663
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:29,336
Get off me! Fucking mutt!

1664
01:30:29,336 --> 01:30:30,837
Get the fuck off me!

1665
01:30:30,837 --> 01:30:33,087
Shit! God damn it! Fuck!

1666
01:30:38,046 --> 01:30:38,261
Shit.

1667
01:30:46,255 --> 01:30:48,922
Yo, it's me. Yo, you gotta get
back here right now.

1668
01:30:48,922 --> 01:30:50,047
You gotta get back here
right fucking now.

1669
01:30:50,047 --> 01:30:50,257
Dude, he left!
He left with it!

1670
01:30:51,256 --> 01:30:52,840
What were
you fucking thinking?

1671
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,673
The fuckin' dog, man!
Listen, you just gotta come.

1672
01:30:55,673 --> 01:30:57,256
They're swarming
the fuckin' building.

1673
01:30:57,256 --> 01:30:58,673
Hold on. Hold on.

1674
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:14,842
Stop! Stop!

1675
01:31:21,051 --> 01:31:21,511
Stop!

1676
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,094
Hey, yo!

1677
01:31:26,092 --> 01:31:27,677
Stop!

1678
01:31:28,676 --> 01:31:30,847
Stop! You're under arrest.

1679
01:31:34,845 --> 01:31:36,677
Get the fuck down!

1680
01:31:36,677 --> 01:31:37,853
Oh, shit!

1681
01:31:45,845 --> 01:31:47,511
He's getting bagged
as we speak, man!

1682
01:31:47,511 --> 01:31:49,054
It's on top of a parking lot.
In a puddle.

1683
01:31:49,054 --> 01:31:50,345
The Sprite bottle.
You can't miss it.

1684
01:31:50,345 --> 01:31:52,430
It's right out front.
It's right out front.

1685
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:53,680
You can't miss it.

1686
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:54,762
I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

1687
01:31:54,762 --> 01:31:55,599
You never talked to me. Bye.

1688
01:31:57,596 --> 01:31:58,846
Police Department!

1689
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:00,515
Come out with your hands up!
Open the door.

1690
01:32:23,515 --> 01:32:25,353
Hey, keep an eye
on this crowd.

1691
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:33,516
They're starting
to set up

1692
01:32:33,516 --> 01:32:34,854
a perimeter for this.

1693
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:40,018
He went
out the window! Window!

1694
01:32:40,018 --> 01:32:41,268
Look up!

1695
01:32:41,268 --> 01:32:42,520
All units!
He's on the building!

1696
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,851
All units.
Call it in now!

1697
01:34:57,282 --> 01:34:58,908
There he is.

1698
01:34:58,908 --> 01:35:00,533
Good to see you, Nick.

1699
01:35:01,532 --> 01:35:02,118
I'm really glad you're here.

1700
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,783
And I gotta tell you,
that is a very cool haircut.

1701
01:35:06,783 --> 01:35:08,783
You look really sharp.

1702
01:35:08,783 --> 01:35:11,283
Mrs. Nikas, it's so good
to see you, too.

1703
01:35:11,283 --> 01:35:12,908
- Good to see you.
- Thank you for bringing

1704
01:35:12,908 --> 01:35:14,033
- Nick in. Thank you.
- Thank you very much

1705
01:35:14,033 --> 01:35:15,201
for everything.

1706
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:16,867
Okay. Listen, I want you
to come with me.

1707
01:35:16,867 --> 01:35:18,201
I'm gonna take you someplace.

1708
01:35:18,201 --> 01:35:20,368
I just enrolled you in
this really terrific class.

1709
01:35:20,368 --> 01:35:21,701
I'm gonna walk you
there right now.

1710
01:35:21,701 --> 01:35:22,372
You are gonna love it.

1711
01:35:26,368 --> 01:35:27,868
You know, Nick,
I have to tell you,

1712
01:35:27,868 --> 01:35:30,243
what Connie did.
Connie did the right thing.

1713
01:35:30,243 --> 01:35:32,868
He did
the really responsible thing.

1714
01:35:32,868 --> 01:35:34,536
And the best news is,

1715
01:35:34,536 --> 01:35:36,034
he's right where he belongs.

1716
01:35:36,034 --> 01:35:37,787
And you're right
where you belong.

1717
01:35:37,787 --> 01:35:39,453
And I gotta tell you,
this place where we are now

1718
01:35:39,453 --> 01:35:42,037
can be a lot of fun
if you let it.

1719
01:35:42,037 --> 01:35:43,412
You know that, don't you?

1720
01:35:43,412 --> 01:35:46,746
Energy.
Energy in my hands.

1721
01:35:46,746 --> 01:35:49,037
Energy.
Energy in my foot.

1722
01:35:49,037 --> 01:35:53,246
- Hi, Peter!
- Hi. Hi, Samantha. Hi.

1723
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:53,954
Please excuse me
for interrupting.

1724
01:35:54,953 --> 01:35:57,372
I just want everybody to
meet my friend Nick.

1725
01:35:57,372 --> 01:35:59,706
Nick, say hi to everybody.

1726
01:36:00,704 --> 01:36:02,747
Hi, Nick!

1727
01:36:03,747 --> 01:36:05,288
That's Samantha.
This is Aubrey.

1728
01:36:05,288 --> 01:36:06,538
- Hi.
- Aubrey conducts this class.

1729
01:36:06,538 --> 01:36:08,456
I've seen these classes.
They're great.

1730
01:36:08,456 --> 01:36:10,039
I think you're gonna like it.
It's a lot of fun.

1731
01:36:10,039 --> 01:36:10,039
I don't know
nobody here though.

1732
01:36:10,789 --> 01:36:10,957
No, you don't.

1733
01:36:11,957 --> 01:36:13,039
That's okay.
There's a lot of people here

1734
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:14,539
that are new, too.
You're not alone.

1735
01:36:14,539 --> 01:36:16,707
You're gonna have a good time.
And I'll be right out here.

1736
01:36:16,707 --> 01:36:18,041
I'm just going to be
waiting for you.

1737
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:19,207
- I'm not leaving without you.
- All right.

1738
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:20,916
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to see you.

1739
01:36:20,916 --> 01:36:22,041
Bye, Peter!

1740
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:23,291
Bye, Samantha.

1741
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:25,541
Nice to meet you.
Can I take your coat?

1742
01:36:26,957 --> 01:36:28,541
I've really had
a long day.

1743
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:30,292
Hey, guys, say hi to Nick
one more time.

1744
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:32,707
- Make him feel welcome.
- Hi, Nick.

1745
01:36:32,707 --> 01:36:34,542
Okay.
Since Nick is here,

1746
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:36,458
we're gonna get to know
each other a little bit more

1747
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:38,542
and play something
called Cross The Room.

1748
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:40,583
So I'd love
everyone to divide up

1749
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:41,708
on one side of the room.

1750
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:43,210
Nick, this way, thank you.

1751
01:36:43,210 --> 01:36:45,542
Uh, Rodney, you can actually
get over here.

1752
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:47,210
Backari next to Andrew.

1753
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:48,460
Perfect.

1754
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:51,793
Okay. I'm going to give you
a prompt.

1755
01:36:51,793 --> 01:36:53,252
I'm gonna say,

1756
01:36:53,252 --> 01:36:56,127
"Cross the room if you
like something.

1757
01:36:56,127 --> 01:36:58,752
"Cross the room
if you want to do something.

1758
01:36:58,752 --> 01:37:02,212
"Cross the room if you have
ever done something."

1759
01:37:02,212 --> 01:37:04,878
And if you have or agree
with those prompts,

1760
01:37:04,878 --> 01:37:06,878
you would cross the room.

1761
01:37:06,878 --> 01:37:08,087
Now,

1762
01:37:08,087 --> 01:37:10,878
you choose whether or not
you want to cross.

1763
01:37:10,878 --> 01:37:14,380
You don't have to.
It could be your secret.

1764
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,462
You choose your truth. Okay?

1765
01:37:16,462 --> 01:37:17,546
Okay.

1766
01:37:17,546 --> 01:37:19,546
So let's start with
something easy.

1767
01:37:19,546 --> 01:37:24,381
Cross the room
if you like candy.

1768
01:37:28,047 --> 01:37:31,921
Mikey and Michael
don't like candy? Okay.

1769
01:37:31,921 --> 01:37:34,090
How about something harder?

1770
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:37,382
Cross the room
if you've ever been in love.

1771
01:37:38,381 --> 01:37:40,426
- I think I have.
- You think you have?

1772
01:37:42,423 --> 01:37:43,716
Okay.

1773
01:37:43,716 --> 01:37:48,099
Cross the room
if you have ever lied.

1774
01:37:55,091 --> 01:37:56,759
Cross the room

1775
01:37:56,759 --> 01:37:58,134
if you've ever
not gotten along

1776
01:37:58,134 --> 01:37:59,882
with your family members
sometimes.

1777
01:37:59,882 --> 01:38:02,551
There were
family problems.

1778
01:38:02,551 --> 01:38:05,220
Family drama.
No family drama?

1779
01:38:07,219 --> 01:38:09,301
Does anybody have
another suggestion?

1780
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:10,469
- I do.
- Sure.

1781
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:11,885
- Oh, sorry, guys.
- Cross the room

1782
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:14,051
if you've ever been blamed
for something

1783
01:38:14,051 --> 01:38:15,927
that you didn't do.

1784
01:38:15,927 --> 01:38:18,474
Oh, plenty of times.

1785
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:26,136
Cross the room if you've ever
been to New Year's Eve,

1786
01:38:26,136 --> 01:38:28,061
Christmas at
Rockefeller Center.

1787
01:38:36,055 --> 01:38:37,595
Travis?

1788
01:38:37,595 --> 01:38:41,389
Cross the room
if you've ever done

1789
01:38:41,389 --> 01:38:44,430
anything stupid
with your friends.

1790
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,889
Cross the room
if you've ever done something

1791
01:38:45,889 --> 01:38:46,935
stupid with your friends.

1792
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:52,390
Mikey, do you have
a suggestion?

1793
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:54,225
Yeah, cross the room

1794
01:38:57,224 --> 01:39:02,390
if you have not been
to Dream Street.

1795
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:05,645
Cross the room if you
have not been to Dream Street.

1796
01:39:09,641 --> 01:39:12,057
- Samantha?
- Cross the room

1797
01:39:12,057 --> 01:39:16,225
if you'd really love to mentor
special ed nursery school.

1798
01:39:16,225 --> 01:39:17,934
Cross the room
if you've ever mentored

1799
01:39:17,934 --> 01:39:19,891

special needs children.

1800
01:39:19,891 --> 01:39:20,895
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1801
01:39:23,893 --> 01:39:26,400

if you have a friend.

1802
01:39:33,394 --> 01:39:34,395
Megan?

1803
01:39:35,395 --> 01:39:38,481
Cross the room
if you've even been lonely.

1804
01:39:42,478 --> 01:39:44,728
Cross the room if

1805
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:48,396
you like musicals.

1806
01:39:49,395 --> 01:39:51,078
Do an easy one.

1807
01:40:07,064 --> 01:40:10,148
Cross the room
if you've ever felt

1808
