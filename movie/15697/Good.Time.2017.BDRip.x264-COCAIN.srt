2
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,626
Okay, Nick,

3
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,836
we're getting close to the end.

4
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,963
But we're moving
into a new section now,

5
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:25,633
what they call
sentence interpretation.

6
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,970
Do you understand that?

7
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,808
You know what those interpreting
a sentence means?

8
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:34,810
No.

9
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,311
It's just a fancy word

10
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:40,397
for telling what the words
mean to you.

11
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:41,690
- Okay.
- Okay.

12
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:42,858
And what these are,

13
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,736
these are common expressions
that people

14
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:47,154
sometimes say.

15
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:48,906
You might hear it
out on the street,

16
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,908
you might've seen it on TV,

17
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,493
uh, maybe a friend,

18
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:53,994
maybe your grandmother.

19
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:56,245
So, I'm going to read you
a few of those, okay?

20
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,831
- Okay.
- All right.

21
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,083
Uh, the first one is,

22
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:03,170
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch."

23
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,880
What does that mean to you,
that expression?

24
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:08,342
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch?"

25
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,180
Don't count your chickens.

26
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,185
Okay.

27
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:19,019
What are you writing down?

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,855
Well, the reason I'm asking
you the questions is

29
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:22,898
because I'm supposed to write...

30
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,191
You know,
write down the answers...

31
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,526
Yeah,
but that's what I'm saying.

32
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,027
Why are you writing that down?

33
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:28,904
So, in case I forget it later.

34
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,364
But I don't like
people talking about me

35
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,949
after I go places.

36
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,867
I don't blame you. I'm not...
And I'm not talking about you.

37
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:36,245
This is just for me.
These are my own notes.

38
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,621
No one sees them but me.

39
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:39,123
I don't like it, but...

40
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:41,083
All right, here's another one.

41
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:45,129
"It's the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease."

42
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,598
What does that expression
mean to you?

43
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:57,061
You ever heard that before?

44
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:01,143
Nick?

45
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:03,981
Okay, Nick, you know what?

46
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,274
Why don't we skip this section

47
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,483
and just move on
to the next one?

48
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,736
It's actually more fun.
It's easier.

49
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,154
It's called word comparisons.

50
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,907
It's two words that
don't appear to be connected,

51
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,409
and then you say what
you think when you hear

52
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,453
the two words together. Okay?

53
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:18,555
Okay.

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,557
All right. First one is

55
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:22,251
cat and mouse.

56
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:25,669
What does that make you think?

57
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,088
They don't like each other.

58
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,007
That's right. They're kind of

59
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:31,759
enemies against
each other, right?

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,135
That's what I said.

61
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:35,097
Okay, um...

62
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:42,192
How about scissors
and a cooking pan?

63
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,855
You can hurt yourself with both.

64
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,153
Okay.

65
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:52,650
How about salt and water?

66
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,282
The beach.

67
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:56,367
The beach.

68
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:58,542
That's a good answer.

69
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,001
Um...

70
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,294
Do you mind, could we go back

71
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,296
to the scissors
and the cooking pan?

72
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:09,966
Um...

73
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,216
When you said
you can hurt yourself,

74
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,676
what were you...
What did you mean?

75
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:16,306
Do you ever think
about hurting yourself?

76
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:21,809
Why did you think of being hurt?

77
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,538
Because I touched the pan,
and I hurt my hand.

78
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:25,729
Oh, well,
that makes perfect sense.

79
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,527
What happened?

80
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:33,368
Do you remember when it was?

81
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:41,039
Do you not want
to talk about this?

82
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,165
I was sitting there
and trying to eat.

83
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,501
And she started yelling at me,
and pushing me,

84
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,545
and just telling me
I can't eat food.

85
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:50,921
That was your grandmother
who was saying that?

86
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:52,339
Yeah, and then
she threw stuff at me.

87
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,567
- She threw things at you?
- Yeah.

88
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:56,093
Then I picked up the pan,
and I threw it at her.

89
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,012
You threw it
at your grandmother?

90
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:59,263
I threw it at the wall.

91
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,773
Oh, you weren't trying
to hit your grandmother?

92
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:11,363
Did you burn yourself
when you threw the pan?

93
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,387
Nick?

94
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:23,245
Nick, it's good that
we should talk about this.

95
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:24,455
This is good stuff

96
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:27,017
we're talking about.

97
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,375
- Excuse me.
- Are you Peter?

98
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:29,877
Yes, I am. We're in the middle
of a session. Hello?

99
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,086
Nick, what are you doing?

100
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,904
We're in the middle
of something here.

101
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:34,224
- The middle of an exam.
- Come on, get up!

102
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:35,374
- Hey, Nick, Nick...
- He's asking me about

103
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,458
the stuff, the pan,

104
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,514
- and the chicken.
- Wait, please!

105
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:39,099
How would you like it
if I made you cry, huh?

106
00:05:39,124 --> 00:05:41,167
- Would you like that?
- No, I would not. But...

107
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:42,585
They told me I had to do this.

108
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:43,836
Get up. Let's go. Let's go!

109
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:45,922
But he wrote...
He has all my stuff!

110
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:47,840
Rip that shit up then!

111
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:49,759
This is my work.
This is my stuff, okay?

112
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,177
Oh, shame on you, Connie.

113
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,679
- Shame on me? Shame on you.
- You're not helping.

114
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,055
Shame on you!

115
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:54,917
- Come on.
- Janice, please,

116
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,448
could you send
Mark and Matthew right away?

117
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:13,253
Is that what you think you are?

118
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,544
What?

119
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:24,617
Jesus Christ.

120
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,620
I'm sorry. It's just that
Grandma said that...

121
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,122
I don't wanna hear about
Grandma anymore, all right?

122
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,623
Fuck Grandma, Nicky.

123
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:34,050
It's just you and me.
I'm your friend, all right?

124
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:42,994
I love you, all right?

125
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,746
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop messing with it.

126
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:10,739
Next?

127
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,448
What are you thinking about?

128
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,325
Nothing.

129
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,682
It's almost over.

130
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:57,421
Stay calm.

131
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:06,050
No, no. No running.

132
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,899
Hey.

133
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,984
- The mask.
- What about it?

134
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,861
The mask.
I want to take it off.

135
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,821
- Huh?
- I want to take off the mask.

136
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,365
We'll take it off
in two minutes. Two minutes.

137
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,202
It's all finished now,
and everything's great.

138
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,329
Nick! Nick!

139
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,189
- Where?
- Down this alley.

140
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,176
Start taking your shit off.

141
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,095
It's not coming off.

142
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,264
It's not coming off.

143
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,015
Connie, help! Help!
I can't breathe.

144
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,183
I can't breathe.

145
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,267
Remember how we did it?

146
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,685
Fingers under the flap
and pull up.

147
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,229
Push it up. Push it up!

148
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,189
Push it up, push it up!
Push it up!

149
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,378
You were fucking incredible.

150
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,362
You were incredible.
Do you understand?

151
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,530
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

152
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,781
You think I could have done it

153
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,699
without you standing
next to me, being strong?

154
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
No.

155
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,035
You feel it, Nicks?

156
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,870
Are you feeling as good
as I'm feeling right now?

157
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,705
- Yeah, I'm cold.
- You're cold?

158
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,457
- Yeah.
- Hey, fuck it.

159
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,490
- Let's get to Virginia, man.
- All right.

160
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,676
What the fuck?

161
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,677
Nick! Nick! Come here.

162
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:43,719
Stay with me.

163
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,845
Where'd he go?

164
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:45,888
Where are you?

165
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,181
Is he at the bank?

166
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:48,516
You circling around?
I'm on the corner.

167
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,017
I'm on the corner
where you dropped me off.

168
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:51,938
You gotta get
back here right now.

169
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,855
I'm outside the Mango Rico.

170
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:56,734
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

171
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,483
He's here?

172
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:03,239
- Get in the car.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,287
I'm so sorry.
The cops, they moved me here.

174
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:11,789
- Don't want me there.
- Don't worry about it.

175
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,124
Let's go.

176
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,917
Are we still going
to the Port Authority?

177
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:17,378
Yes, nothing's changed,
exact same place.

178
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:43,422
You wanna hold it?

179
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:44,578
Yeah. I don't care.

180
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,295
What was that sound?

181
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,798
What the fuck did you do?

182
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:27,865
My face. My face.

183
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:31,452
My face, my face.
My face is burning.

184
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:32,828
- My face is burning.
- Your face isn't burning.

185
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,205
- My face is burning.
- Hey, look at me, look at me.

186
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:35,456
- Connie, my face is burning.
- Look at me.

187
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,832
Your face isn't burning.
You'll be all right.

188
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,668
Look, look, look.

189
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:39,126
My face.

190
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:42,314
- My face, Connie. My...
- Just breathe, just breathe.

191
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,177
- We going for a walk?
- No, no.

192
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:48,636
I think I'm gonna throw up.

193
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:52,640
You're not going
to fucking throw up. Come on.

194
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:53,808
I'm gonna throw up.

195
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:54,685
No.
What did I just tell you?

196
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:55,851
I don't know.

197
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:57,144
I told you you're not
going to throw up,

198
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:59,981
so you're not going
to throw up, all right?

199
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,566
You're not.

200
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:03,693
Count to 30.

201
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,528
One, two, three, four...

202
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,909
Keep counting!

203
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:12,660
It's an emergency.
I gotta use the bathroom.

204
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:14,161
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no.

205
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:15,246
Bathrooms
are for customers only.

206
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:16,710
Hey, customers only.

207
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:23,004
Hey.

208
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:24,046
Yes, I'm gonna get something.

209
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,315
Just give me five minutes.

210
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,841
No, no. Open up now!

211
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:29,541
Just wash that shit
off your face already.

212
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,680
Nick, what the fuck are you
doing? Get in the sink.

213
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:34,324
Jesus Christ.

214
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:36,851
- Put your hands up.
- Come out!

215
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:39,061
- Take it off.
- Yeah.

216
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,430
In five seconds,
I'll call the police!

217
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,356
Get off anything
with red or pink dye, okay?

218
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:44,025
My brother is
mentally handicapped.

219
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:45,693
A bucket of paint
fell off a construction truck

220
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:46,902
and hit him on the head.

221
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,029
I'm gonna come out
in one second.

222
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,697
It's an emergency, all right?

223
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:50,948
Please, just give me
five minutes.

224
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:53,534
- It burns, it burns.
- Stop, stop it.

225
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:54,869
The pants got dye all over
them. Got to get them off.

226
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,454
I like these pants.

227
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:59,040
I don't care if you like them.
Gotta get them off right now.

228
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,709
You got sweatpants underneath.
That's why you wore them.

229
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,544
Hurry up. Lace them up.

230
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:04,879
Look for anything...

231
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,226
- Yes, yes, yes, please.
- Come out now!

232
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,425
Just keep your head down.

233
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:51,547
Gonna pull back up on us.

234
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:52,840
Just don't say anything,
all right?

235
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:54,341
- Okay.
- Don't look at them.

236
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:55,509
Don't be scared.

237
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,557
- All right.
- Let me do all the talking.

238
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,200
Hey fellas, where we going?

239
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:04,685
Can I talk to you for a minute?

240
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:06,186
First of all, could you take
your hoodie off for me?

241
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:07,521
Why? What did we do wrong?

242
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:09,565
Hey.
You with the black sweatshirt.

243
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:11,208
Yo, my man, turn around!

244
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:12,443
He's all right.
We didn't do anything wrong.

245
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:14,361
Yo, oh, oh!
Get back here!

246
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:24,961
NYPD. Stop!

247
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,521
Nick, let's go!

248
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,176
Nick!

249
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:05,259
Connie!

250
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,595
Stop! Stop!

251
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:08,682
You're under...

252
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,361
NYPD.
You are not getting up.

253
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:25,784
Sir, I need you to get up!

254
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:31,705
Thanks for the welcome.

255
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,105
Yo, CO!

256
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,922
Let me talk
to the fucking captain, man.

257
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,132
I've been here for four days!

258
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,926
- Get off the bars!
- Fuck!

259
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:06,770
Stop fighting!

260
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,107
Stop fighting!
Get the captain.

261
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,441
Stop fighting.

262
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,157
Stop fighting or chemical
weapons will be utilized.

263
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:21,000
Stop fighting.

264
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,139
The judge is gonna ask her
about Connie.

265
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,558
And if she says to the judge,
"I can't talk about that."

266
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,061
He's gonna say, "Then go away,
I'm not going to help Nick."

267
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,648
She needs to keep the judge
happy, answer his questions.

268
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,733
She can't do that
unless you answer

269
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,151
- her questions first.
- I don't like to.

270
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,440
I don't want to.

271
00:18:58,465 --> 00:18:59,786
The point is, it doesn't
matter what you tell me.

272
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:01,121
It doesn't matter what you say.

273
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:02,998
It doesn't matter what we do
in this time together.

274
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,291
Nothing that you and I

275
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:06,485
do here is going to get
your brother in trouble.

276
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,302
Then why do you keep
asking about him?

277
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:08,803
Because, you know what?

278
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:11,806
The thing is, is that I don't
think you're as responsible

279
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,562
for this
as you believe that you are.

280
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,841
That money was for us.

281
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:40,635
And he was going
to buy me a farm,

282
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:42,387
and we were gonna
live in the woods.

283
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:44,305
And I was going to be able
to do whatever I wanted,

284
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:45,640
when I wanted, okay?

285
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:46,891
You don't love me, okay?

286
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:48,143
He loves me. Connie loves me!

287
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,519
Talking all day
on the phone over here, man.

288
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
You don't know what love is!

289
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,729
Yo, son,
can you please hurry up?

290
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,356
I don't want to talk
to you no more! Okay?

291
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:54,482
That was for us.

292
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:55,859
- Hey, yo...
- He did it for us.

293
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,397
I'm talking
to my grandmother, okay?

294
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,509
16,480.
You need another ten grand.

295
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,844
You can't do anything with this?

296
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:24,429
This stuff is dirty.
It's nasty.

297
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,888
You can't clean it?
You can't do nothing with it?

298
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:28,016
Nah, nah, nah. Come on.
It's all garbage.

299
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,684
You get another ten grand,

300
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,436
I'll get the judge
to sign the order.

301
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:32,604
And that's it.
I'll have the order

302
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:33,688
waiting for you.

303
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,732
Your brother will get out.

304
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,196
Go get the ten grand.

305
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:51,206
We're gonna watch Empire.

306
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:52,707
What the fuck are you doing?

307
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,417
I was watching this channel.
You can't do that.

308
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:55,543
I was watching
something in it before.

309
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,629
You do not rock on this TV, man.

310
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,879
Hey, yo, man.

311
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,049
If I was you,
I wouldn't fuck with the TV.

312
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,259
- Just leave it alone.
- Don't talk to me, all right.

313
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,427
I don't like you, all right?

314
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,762
- Don't talk to me.
- You got that green...

315
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,055
Nobody was in here before.

316
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:08,889
I'm allowed to watch
whatever I want.

317
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,227
Yo, my man.
Don't touch that TV!

318
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:13,412
Man, this is some...

319
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:14,896
What the fuck is you doing, man?

320
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:17,982
Give me that!

321
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,734
Are you not entertained, huh?

322
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:20,985
Not entertained?

323
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:22,946
I told you I was gonna get you,

324
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,574
you bitch motherfucker!

325
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:14,438
- I got it!
- No, no, I'm here.

326
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:16,774
- Who is it?
- It's Connie.

327
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:18,317
Con...

328
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:20,110
No, no, no, no.

329
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:22,905
Ma... Mama,
I called him down.

330
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,074
Wait a minute.
How'd you get in the building?

331
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:27,326
- I invited him up.
- They didn't call up.

332
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:29,328
The doorman recognized me.

333
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:30,454
He's not coming in here.

334
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:31,914
Yes, he is.

335
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,418
Well, I can just
come back later, Loren.

336
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:36,669
Hey.

337
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,254
Connie, we're having dinner.

338
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:39,421
And I think

339
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:40,506
- if you could just...
- I... I can leave.

340
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:41,757
No, no, no.

341
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,509
- Go to my room.
- This is a very bad

342
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,487
time for us.

343
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:46,762
What's wrong with you?

344
00:22:46,763 --> 00:22:47,930
What's wrong with you?

345
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,348
How rude!
I'd never treat

346
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:50,575
one of your friends this way.

347
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,518
- Look at you!
- What?

348
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,853
I'm begging you
to shut your mouth!

349
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:58,440
- Shut my mouth?
- Please, please...

350
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:00,442
Would you just
please go look at yourself

351
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:02,278
in the mirror?

352
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:05,114
Just look at yourself.
This morning you were fine.

353
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,282
What are you talking about?

354
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,449
I'm fine right now.

355
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,867
This is your problem.

356
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:10,452
Would you just do me a favor?

357
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:11,620
- You know what?
- What?

358
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:12,871
Call Dr. Klienman.

359
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:14,373
Why don't you call him?

360
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:16,056
I have a friend over.

361
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:18,248
Mom, I want to stop
this conversation.

362
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:19,833
- Yes, yes.
- I am stopping it!

363
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,794
- Yes.
- I'm zipping it!

364
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,087
And I'm gonna go
visit with my friend.

365
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:25,255
- Yes.
- You get a hold of yourself!

366
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:27,301
- Do that.
- Fucking freak!

367
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,596
Puerto Vallarta.

368
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:34,515
They have the best, best hotels.

369
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:35,682
I love it there.

370
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,601
There's a Grand Miramar
resort and spa.

371
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:38,977
You can drink right in the pool.

372
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:41,021
It's like they have a whole bar.

373
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:43,982
Ah, fuck.
The flight's too long.

374
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:45,441
It's like eight hours.

375
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:47,587
Okay, that's all right.

376
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:49,446
What about Florida?

377
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:50,948
Or hey, hey, hey.

378
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:52,157
Can you just put it down
for a second?

379
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:53,200
Costa Rica.

380
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:54,450
Just put it down for a second.

381
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,495
I gotta come clean
with you about something.

382
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:57,541
What?

383
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,638
So, I told you
about my brother, yeah?

384
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:02,748
Yeah.

385
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:04,480
I told you about the program

386
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:06,783
he's forced to attend and
how he shouldn't be there.

387
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:07,736
Yeah.

388
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:08,942
And how everybody
involved with it doesn't know

389
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,374
what the fuck they're doing,
and he fucking hates it.

390
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,418
Hey, Costa Rica's
only four and a half hours...

391
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,211
Please, could you just put it
down for two seconds.

392
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:19,108
Just listen to what I'm saying.

393
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:23,279
Look,

394
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:25,888
something happened,
I don't know exactly what.

395
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:27,337
But one of the therapists
was abusing him,

396
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:29,390
and I guess he must have
lashed out violently,

397
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,396
and he really hurt the guy.

398
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:35,761
Now this guy's
gonna press charges.

399
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:36,866
My brother's been arrested.

400
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:38,159
He's being held
at Riker's Island.

401
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,202
Oh, my God, that's awful.

402
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:42,472
I know.

403
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:44,290
You have no idea.

404
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,624
I've just gotta get him
out of there

405
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,979
before something bad happens.

406
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,382
See, he could get
killed in there.

407
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:56,969
I'm just a little short
on the bail money right now.

408
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,114
How short?

409
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:01,557
It's like a few thousand.

410
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:03,851
Okay. That's not bad.

411
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,620
That's why I was just hoping
your mom's credit card

412
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,961
could cover the rest of it.

413
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:11,769
Oh. Um...

414
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,196
Look, it's just to get him
out of Riker's.

415
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,822
It's like a temporary loan.

416
00:25:16,823 --> 00:25:18,980
You get it right back.

417
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,035
Any judge is gonna dismiss this

418
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:23,305
as soon as he gets to court.

419
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,581
Yeah.

420
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:26,874
Okay?

421
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,709
What, and our trip?

422
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,396
We'll go after?

423
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:33,005
Seriously, that's your response

424
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:35,734
to what I just told you?

425
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,343
That's your response?

426
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:41,347
Um, I mean, I'm thinking
about your brother, too.

427
00:25:41,348 --> 00:25:43,200
Yo!

428
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:44,558
We gotta make a different stop.

429
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,727
It's still Queens. It's, uh...

430
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:49,729
82nd and Queens Boulevard.

431
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,232
It's near the Union Turnpike.

432
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,877
Eric, he's coming.

433
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:55,236
What'd I tell ya?

434
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:56,862
Couple of hours, right?

435
00:25:56,863 --> 00:25:58,882
Yeah. You got the full ten?

436
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:00,241
10,000?

437
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,535
- $10,000.
- Yeah.

438
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:05,079
- You do credit, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,683
Wait. $10,000?

440
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,958
Yeah.

441
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,209
You said it was like
a couple thousand dollars.

442
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,419
It's a loan.

443
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,379
You get it back
the same time as the three.

444
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,547
What's the difference?

445
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:16,465
It's like $7,000 difference,
you know.

446
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:18,634
It's for my brother.
You're gonna get it back

447
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:19,802
the same day. Right? Right?

448
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:20,928
Yeah, yeah, she'll get it back.

449
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:23,115
You'll get it back.

450
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,793
Are we cool?

451
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,061
- It's for my brother.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

452
00:26:29,062 --> 00:26:30,104
It's fine. It's fine.

453
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:31,230
Hey, can you
put it through right now?

454
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:32,315
I want to get him out tonight.

455
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:35,443
Tonight? It's 8:35.

456
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,111
Judges go to dinner at 9:00.

457
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,738
So what?
What's the problem?

458
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:40,448
Can you not make a call?

459
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:41,574
They go to dinner.

460
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:43,409
It's only 20 minutes
to do the bond,

461
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,077
- prepare the paperwork.
- You got 20 minutes.

462
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:46,579
Can't you at least
see what's possible?

463
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,247
- She's paying already.
- I got you.

464
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:49,752
You're being pushy.

465
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:53,340
Thank you.

466
00:26:57,551 --> 00:27:00,196
Hi, Bobby, how are you?

467
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:01,679
Yeah, I know, I know.

468
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,183
Sorry. I just have a client
that walked in.

469
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:09,330
Wanted me to post a bond now.

470
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:13,417
Yeah, can you just
check, please?

471
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:17,213
Last name N-I-K-A-S. Nikolas.

472
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,591
You think the judge will wait?

473
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:22,534
Come on, just ask.

474
00:27:22,535 --> 00:27:24,011
We good?

475
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:25,388
It's pretty late for this.

476
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,205
Sorry, it's taking
longer. The new system...

477
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:30,351
I know.
Those chips are such a...

478
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:31,960
They're the bane
of my existence.

479
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:33,687
Ah...

480
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:35,755
Hold on. He's not on...

481
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,215
He's not on the calendar
for tonight.

482
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:39,276
What's the calendar?

483
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:40,635
Where is he?

484
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:43,638
Do you see anything there,
any notations?

485
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:45,223
He's at Elmhurst.

486
00:27:45,224 --> 00:27:46,599
Lovely. Elmhurst.

487
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,101
Elmhurst, the hospital?

488
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,287
Yeah, like where sick people go.

489
00:27:50,312 --> 00:27:51,813
What's...
What's wrong with him?

490
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:53,374
They're not gonna tell ya.
It's privileged information.

491
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:54,607
Does this mean we're not going?

492
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:55,900
He's not going
to be arraigned in court

493
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:56,943
because they've got him
in the hospital.

494
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,069
Can we still go away?

495
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,487
So until he gets
a medical clearance,

496
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:00,947
they're not going to put him
on the calendar.

497
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:02,282
When's that going to be?

498
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:03,908
Bobby, give me a second.
Just bear with me.

499
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:05,243
When did he
get put in the hospital?

500
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:06,286
The card is declined.

501
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,789
I think maybe
you're punching it in wrong,

502
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,583
or something?
'Cause I just used it.

503
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:13,251
What the fuck
is wrong with your card?

504
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:14,395
I have no idea.

505
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,503
You can call
the bank if you want.

506
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,606
I do want to call them.

507
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,340
I will dial for you,
and you do it.

508
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:20,967
Hold on, Bobby.
What do you want to do?

509
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,594
Can you not call someone?

510
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:24,262
Give me a second.
I'm going to call Corrections.

511
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:26,097
I'll see what I can find out.

512
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:28,409
I'm going to punch
the numbers, and then...

513
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:31,688
Fuck! It's my mom.

514
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:33,772
I'm so sorry.

515
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:35,690
I'm so sorry.

516
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:37,192
Hi, Mom.

517
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:41,112
Did you, um, cancel the card?

518
00:28:41,113 --> 00:28:42,840
Did you...

519
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:44,282
Do you want to talk to them?

520
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:45,700
Mom! Sorry, sorry.

521
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:47,202
- Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Calm down.

522
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,328
No, no, no,
of course, of course.

523
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,121
Mom, Mom, Mom,
please listen to me.

524
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:52,499
I'm at a legitimate...

525
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,792
It's a bail bonds place.

526
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:54,627
So the thing is this.
The thing is...

527
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,127
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Hold on.

528
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:59,130
- We get the money back! Mom.
- I'll call you back, Bobby.

529
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:00,799
Chaos. Hold on a second.

530
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,217
Can you take that outside?

531
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,177
Sorry. Excuse me, sir.
It's a legitimate loan.

532
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,012
Okay. We've got
ten minutes, decide.

533
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,305
What do you want to do?

534
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:08,472
Look. It's a fucking disaster.

535
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:10,141
I didn't know she was going
to be like this.

536
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:11,810
I don't like people
yelling in my office.

537
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:13,144
I understand, I understand.

538
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:14,646
Just let me get back
the money from earlier,

539
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:16,314
and I'll come back
with the rest in full.

540
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:17,816
The money in my safe?

541
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:19,651
No, that stays in the safe.

542
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:20,819
You want to get
your brother out?

543
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,195
You bring me
the other ten grand.

544
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:23,488
That's how it works.

545
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:24,531
Come on, man.
Just give me a break, please.

546
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:26,491
I'm giving you a break.

547
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:29,160
That money stays in the safe.
That's mine.

548
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:31,913
You get the other ten,
I'll get your brother out.

549
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:33,540
You are so good.

550
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:36,394
Please, this isn't your fault.

551
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:42,012
I just wanted to do
a good thing for somebody.

552
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:12,097
Hey, man,
what's with all the cops?

553
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:13,991
What do you mean?

554
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:16,101
There's cops everywhere.

555
00:31:16,102 --> 00:31:18,579
Cops outside my dad's room.

556
00:31:18,604 --> 00:31:20,438
All right, what floor is he on?

557
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,773
Five.

558
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,358
There's not supposed to be
any prisoners on five.

559
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,193
They're supposed to be on six.

560
00:31:25,194 --> 00:31:26,945
Supposed to be on six?

561
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:28,923
That's unacceptable.

562
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,211
Excuse me.

563
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:44,546
Where's the nearest bathroom?

564
00:31:44,547 --> 00:31:45,964
Down the hall, to the left.

565
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:47,736
Thank you.

566
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:33,344
Hey.

567
00:32:33,345 --> 00:32:35,263
Something just scared
the shit out of me, man.

568
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:36,407
What?

569
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,350
I was sleeping with my dad
down the hall.

570
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:42,437
Who's dying, so I'm already
half freaked out already.

571
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:46,107
And, uh, all the TV channels
started changing on their own.

572
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:47,525
When I get up, it stops.

573
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:50,528
When I sit back down,
they all start changing again.

574
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,840
So I...

575
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,699
What the fuck is that?

576
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,951
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

577
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:02,707
Fuck, man.
I'm think I'm losing my mind.

578
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,293
I've been here
48 hours straight.

579
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:06,961
Want something
from the vending machine?

580
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:08,477
Nah, I'm good. Thank you.

581
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:24,017
Hello?

582
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,970
Hello?

583
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:14,792
Going down
to vending to get some coffee.

584
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:16,460
You want some?

585
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:19,338
Yeah, get me a coffee.

586
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:20,673
I'll see you in a sec.

587
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:47,356
Excuse me, ma'am.

588
00:36:47,357 --> 00:36:49,000
Do you mind
if I put my brother on first?

589
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:51,693
It's so cold, and he doesn't
have a jacket or anything.

590
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:53,570
- Is that all right?
- You don't mind?

591
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:54,905
All right.

592
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:57,199
Thank you so much.
God bless you.

593
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,698
Turn him
to the side. There you go.

594
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,455
All right.

595
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:05,039
Thank you.

596
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,209
Ready?

597
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,377
Hey, can we get on now?

598
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:11,296
Yeah, you guys can get on.

599
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:13,287
Just go in this way.

600
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,056
Okay.

601
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:22,309
There we go.

602
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,395
All right.

603
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:28,474
Push it. There you go.

604
00:38:03,474 --> 00:38:04,975
6180 Woodhaven.

605
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:07,102
That's ours.
Close to the building, please.

606
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:08,774
Okay.

607
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:14,748
- Regal Garden.
- That's us. That's us.

608
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:30,924
220 Fourth Avenue.

609
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:36,263
Okay.
Thank you so much.

610
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,490
Excuse me.

611
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:42,765
- Good night.
- Thank you.

612
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:44,308
I hope you feel better.

613
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:45,685
You, too.

614
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:49,272
- Hope he does, too.
- Okay now...

615
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:50,528
Bring your feet up.

616
00:38:54,528 --> 00:38:56,171
Hey, yo!

617
00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:59,657
I only had three stops.
I didn't know about a fourth.

618
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:01,451
That's odd, man.
I definitely called.

619
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:03,453
This dispatch be messing me up.

620
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:04,537
It's all good.

621
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:06,122
We only live
a few blocks from here.

622
00:39:06,123 --> 00:39:07,792
That's why I figured
you were leaving us last.

623
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,668
A few blocks.
What, like two blocks?

624
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:14,881
Like a literal two blocks
or a "15 minutes" two blocks?

625
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:16,010
Two blocks. It's right there.

626
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,343
All right, I got you.

627
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:21,220
Thank you.

628
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:23,347
All right, say when.

629
00:39:23,348 --> 00:39:24,643
Uh...

630
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:27,580
It's just down here
on the right.

631
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:29,124
It's the one with the driveway.

632
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,959
- You don't got to pull in.
- Oh, yeah?

633
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,127
I'll just push him from here.

634
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,092
Perfect, thanks, man.

635
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:40,820
Yep.

636
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:54,316
- Crystal?
- Hmm?

637
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:56,485
Look for me, do not open.

638
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:58,820
Who's this? I don't know.

639
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:01,498
Every second!

640
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:04,910
Can I help you?

641
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:05,953
Hey, what's up?

642
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:08,497
Is there an older couple
that lives here?

643
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:09,748
- Annie?
- I just got dropped off

644
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:11,333
- by the Access-A-Ride.
- Oh, Lord!

645
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:12,918
What happened again?

646
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,920
Somebody at the door for you.

647
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:16,088
Who is it?

648
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:17,968
I don't know.
Some white guy.

649
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,468
Uh...

650
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,679
I'm hoping you recognize me
from the Access-A-Ride.

651
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,305
Yeah.

652
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:27,598
The driver just dropped us
off on our house on 23rd,

653
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,268
and I can't find
my keys anywhere.

654
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:32,855
And my brother doesn't have
a jacket, and it's freezing.

655
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:34,857
Is there any way
I can use your phone?

656
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:36,441
Just for, like, two minutes?

657
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:38,279
That's okay. That's okay.

658
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,320
God bless you.

659
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:41,989
- God bless you.
- Come in.

660
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,323
It's so cold.

661
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,992
It's freezing.

662
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:46,201
All right.

663
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:56,795
This is the phone, okay?

664
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:59,006
If you use the phone,
do not unplug.

665
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:00,132
All right.

666
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:01,633
The battery no good.

667
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,015
- It's messed up, okay?
- Okay.

668
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:08,473
Thank you.

669
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:12,095
Uh...

670
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,315
Oh, God damn it.

671
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:20,319
Mom, it's Connie. Nick and I
are locked out of the house,

672
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,864
and I don't have my keys
or my wallet or anything.

673
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:25,824
So we're gonna wait at

674
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:29,077
the Dunkin' Donuts
until you get off work.

675
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:32,873
But if you get this message,
can you call me back at...

676
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:34,333
What's the number here?

677
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:37,002
- 917.
- 917.

678
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:39,004
- 718.
- 718.

679
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:40,839
- 63.
- 63.

680
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,843
- 17.
- 17.

681
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:45,260
So, yeah, call me back
if you get this

682
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:46,678
in the next, like, five minutes.

683
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,180
Okay.

684
00:41:51,824 --> 00:41:53,742
Um, can I just leave him here

685
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:55,202
for, like, ten minutes
while I go break a window?

686
00:41:55,203 --> 00:41:56,370
Why?

687
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:57,871
Why?

688
00:41:57,872 --> 00:41:59,705
- So I can get into my house.
- What window?

689
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:01,333
Uh, my window.

690
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:03,001
- My window! Not yours.
- Why did you not call

691
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:03,670
- a locksmith?
- Because I don't have

692
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,338
any money in my...
I don't have my wallet.

693
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:07,506
I don't have any money either.

694
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:09,549
No, no. I understand.

695
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,885
Um... Could I...

696
00:42:11,886 --> 00:42:13,053
Could I borrow

697
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:13,681
some clothes for him?
Because I...

698
00:42:14,681 --> 00:42:17,015
How many hours
does your mother work?

699
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:18,517
Well, she gets off at,
like, 7:00, so she'll be back

700
00:42:18,518 --> 00:42:19,725
at, like, 7:30. But...

701
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:21,353
Um, I hoping
she gets my message.

702
00:42:21,354 --> 00:42:23,772
If you want,
I can give you a room,

703
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,774
not you, for your brother.

704
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:27,109
You wait until your mother

705
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,111
- came back from work.
- Yeah?

706
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,612
Yeah.

707
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:31,863
It's gonna be a long time,

708
00:42:31,864 --> 00:42:33,365
that's, like, seven hours.
But is that okay?

709
00:42:33,366 --> 00:42:35,075
Let me show you the room.

710
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:36,868
Why, thank you so much.
That's...

711
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:39,541
Let me show you the room.

712
00:42:41,412 --> 00:42:42,590
Come with me.

713
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,591
But, sorry,
the light doesn't work.

714
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:57,102
We have the TV, okay?

715
00:43:05,102 --> 00:43:07,103
Okay. Leave him there.

716
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:08,654
Come with me.

717
00:43:15,654 --> 00:43:19,175
I've been sitting on the couch,

718
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,950
watching TV.

719
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:22,785
The remote doesn't work.
Okay? It's no good.

720
00:43:22,786 --> 00:43:24,204
If you want
to change the channel,

721
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:26,164
- you go in the box, okay?
- Okay, I can just sit here.

722
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,290
It's fine. Thank you so much.

723
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,666
Okay, okay, that's enough.

724
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:29,127
Crystal?

725
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:31,169
Yes?

726
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,345
Come on, baby.

727
00:43:39,345 --> 00:43:40,637
Listen.

728
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:42,138
- I have work tomorrow.
- Mmm-hmm.

729
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:43,723
I'm going to take my medicine

730
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:44,518
- to sleep, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

731
00:43:45,518 --> 00:43:47,810
Put your phone down, Crystal!

732
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:50,230
Always giving me
problems with the phone!

733
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:51,898
Stop the phone, okay?

734
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:52,525
All the time
you're doing that to me.

735
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:54,901
When I'm talking to you,

736
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,402
I don't want your eye
in the phone.

737
00:43:56,403 --> 00:43:58,696
You have to watch me,
eyes to eyes.

738
00:43:58,697 --> 00:44:00,513
Okay. Okay.

739
00:44:22,513 --> 00:44:24,281
Shit.

740
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:43,867
Um, I'm sorry,

741
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:46,119
I just need to look
for something really quickly.

742
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,370
Yeah, it's fine.
Just don't, uh...

743
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,588
Just try not to wake him up.

744
00:44:56,588 --> 00:44:58,131
Um...

745
00:44:58,132 --> 00:44:59,595
What's that in your hair?

746
00:45:02,595 --> 00:45:06,431
This? I found some hair dye
in your bathroom.

747
00:45:06,432 --> 00:45:07,894
You dyed your hair?

748
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:13,182
Yeah.

749
00:45:13,731 --> 00:45:15,942
Just kind of a weirdo.

750
00:45:16,942 --> 00:45:18,276
I hope that's not the one

751
00:45:18,277 --> 00:45:19,652
from the bottom of the cabinet.

752
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:23,406
- Hold on a second.
- I don't know what color

753
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,074
- your hair is gonna turn out.
- I hope you don't mind.

754
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:26,492
I took your mom's phone in here.

755
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:28,119
That's not my mom.
That's my grandmother,

756
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,787
and I don't care what you do
with that lady's phone.

757
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:31,414
As long as you don't
bring it back...

758
00:45:31,415 --> 00:45:34,250
Sorry, this is my mother.
I just need to take this.

759
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:36,085
Okay.

760
00:45:36,086 --> 00:45:37,253
Hey, I said hold on

761
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:38,630
- for a second.
- Hold on to what?

762
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:40,506
You don't understand.
Everything's falling apart.

763
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:41,925
No. Stop it.

764
00:45:41,926 --> 00:45:43,468
Stop what?
Where are you?

765
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:45,678
- I'm with Nick right now.
- What?

766
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,263
Oh, great.
So you got your brother back,

767
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:48,598
and now you don't need me?

768
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,600
No, just calm down, calm down.

769
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:52,018
There's no reason to worry.

770
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,604
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

771
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:56,773
- I just...
- No, just hold on a second.

772
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:58,274
What I'm gonna need you to do,

773
00:45:58,275 --> 00:45:59,776
you get a cab
and you come pick us up.

774
00:45:59,777 --> 00:46:01,027
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner here.

775
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:02,445
My mom spoke to the doorman

776
00:46:02,446 --> 00:46:04,280
and told him to call her
if I try to leave.

777
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:06,509
What time does
the doorman switch shifts?

778
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:08,034
At 5:00 or 6:00.

779
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:09,661
Okay. At 5:00 a.m.,

780
00:46:09,662 --> 00:46:11,704
you go downstairs,
get a car and come pick us up.

781
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:13,122
Oh, I don't know, Connie.

782
00:46:13,123 --> 00:46:14,791
I'm sorry. I can't stay
on the phone much longer.

783
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,125
It's rude. It's not my phone.

784
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:17,210
It's rude?
Whose phone is it?

785
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:18,294
Where are you?

786
00:46:18,295 --> 00:46:19,379
What's the address here?

787
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,132
220 Fourth Avenue.

788
00:46:22,132 --> 00:46:23,675
Connie, who is that?

789
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:25,635
Who are you talking to?

790
00:46:25,636 --> 00:46:27,529
Connie. Hello? Hello?

791
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:29,532
I just sent you the address.
Did you get it?

792
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:31,516
Uh, yeah.

793
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:34,143
Okay, so come pick us up
as soon as you can.

794
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:36,145
I love you. See you in a bit.

795
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:37,313
I thought I should let you know,

796
00:46:37,314 --> 00:46:38,398
but my grandmother told me

797
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,983
- not to talk to you.
- Hey.

798
00:46:39,984 --> 00:46:41,567
I don't care
what she says anyways. But...

799
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:44,696
Would you mind
just talking outside?

800
00:46:44,697 --> 00:46:46,155
I really don't want
to wake him up.

801
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:47,167
Let's just go outside.

802
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:58,376
Just gonna make my brother
something to eat.

803
00:46:58,377 --> 00:47:00,646
You want something?

804
00:47:00,671 --> 00:47:02,255
Uh...

805
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:03,759
I wouldn't do that.

806
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,051
What is all this shit?

807
00:47:07,052 --> 00:47:09,262
You're not really
gonna find anything.

808
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:10,557
I have chicken nuggets
in here actually.

809
00:47:11,557 --> 00:47:13,099
Um, that should be good.

810
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,907
Yeah.

811
00:47:27,907 --> 00:47:29,365
How old are you?

812
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:31,760
Um, I'm 16.

813
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:33,846
Sixteen?

814
00:47:33,871 --> 00:47:36,206
You look way older than that.

815
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:38,379
I know. I get that.

816
00:47:42,379 --> 00:47:44,712
So what's up?
You just stay up all night?

817
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,095
I go back in my room.

818
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:51,766
Stay up, eat,
watch movies, smoke.

819
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:54,148
- Is that weed?
- Yeah.

820
00:47:57,148 --> 00:47:59,861
It has no effect on me.
I'm immune to it.

821
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:03,111
My boyfriend sells this shit.

822
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:05,423
For like $30.

823
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:07,157
How old's your boyfriend?

824
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:09,953
He's not my boyfriend. My ex.

825
00:48:10,953 --> 00:48:13,123
- He's a drug dealer?
- Yeah.

826
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:15,834
Where does he live?

827
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:19,252
Can't disclose that.

828
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:20,754
Oh, yeah? Why not?

829
00:48:20,755 --> 00:48:22,589
'Cause it's gonna
make his house hot.

830
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:23,798
Can't do that to him.

831
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:24,966
What, from me?

832
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:27,303
From anybody.

833
00:48:29,597 --> 00:48:30,850
Hmm.

834
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,768
We're out to a call of a lady

835
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:37,103
that's threatening
to commit suicide.

836
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:38,270
The reporter on this
is her husband,

837
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:40,166
who's at a different location.

838
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,775
Apparently, she's armed herself

839
00:48:41,776 --> 00:48:44,778
with a knife and has taken
some anti-depressant drugs.

840
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:47,614
This is our second time
out to this apartment today.

841
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,175
And it looks like

842
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,284
she's still out front
in her car here.

843
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:52,619
The red minivan.

844
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,709
Shit.

845
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:02,438
Sharon. Stop it!

846
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,839
Did he just try to kick her?

847
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,050
- I want to help you.
- No, you don't!

848
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:08,677
- You gotta help me. Yes, I do.
- You lied to me.

849
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:10,303
I'm not lying to you.

850
00:49:10,304 --> 00:49:13,348
Come on, we need you out here.
Come on, come on.

851
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:14,975
- Give me that knife!
- Oh!

852
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:17,954
Back off! Lady...

853
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:19,479
Jesus Christ.

854
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,314
Get your arm outta there.

855
00:49:20,315 --> 00:49:21,648
Bring it out.

856
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:22,816
We still have
the knife under there.

857
00:49:22,817 --> 00:49:23,859
Yeah. We're fine.

858
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,318
- Oh, my God.
- You gotta change this.

859
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,487
I don't want to see them
justify this shit.

860
00:49:27,488 --> 00:49:29,322
She's fine. There's
nothing we can do for that.

861
00:49:29,323 --> 00:49:31,241
Just leave
the knife right there.

862
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:36,176
Oh, look at the doggy!

863
00:49:36,177 --> 00:49:38,095
...say he was
caught breeding pit bulls

864
00:49:38,096 --> 00:49:40,222
for dog fighting
inside his home.

865
00:49:40,223 --> 00:49:42,683
That is messed up.
I really love dogs.

866
00:49:42,684 --> 00:49:44,851
One of my cousin's
friends, Tiara,

867
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:46,603
she has this dog.

868
00:49:46,604 --> 00:49:48,105
His name is Blade.

869
00:49:48,106 --> 00:49:50,941
He's a Great Dane.
Oh, my gosh!

870
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:54,444
I think I was a dog
in a previous life.

871
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:57,423
In fact, I know I was.

872
00:49:57,448 --> 00:49:59,533
It's why they love me so much.

873
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:01,368
You're watching
Time Warner Cable News.

874
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:03,289
New York 1.

875
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:06,206
Now an update on last week's
bank robbery in Flushing.

876
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,249
Authorities are still
searching for.

877
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,792
Constantine Nikas,

878
00:50:08,793 --> 00:50:10,127
suspected of carrying
out the robbery

879
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:11,753
along with his brother.

880
00:50:11,754 --> 00:50:13,714
Nikolas Nikas was arrested
near the scene

881
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,549
after crashing through
a plate-glass window

882
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,759
at the New World Mall.
Today the brothers'

883
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,761
grandmother is speaking out
in an exclusive interview

884
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:21,388
with NY1's Tara Lynn Wagner.

885
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:23,432
She joins us now from Flushing
with the details.

886
00:50:23,433 --> 00:50:24,558
Well, that's right, Lewis.

887
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,144
In a New York 1 exclusive,
Agapia Nikas

888
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:28,437
describes her complicated

889
00:50:28,438 --> 00:50:30,230
relationship with her grandsons.

890
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:31,732
She took out a restraining order

891
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:33,877
against Constantine
earlier this year,

892
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:36,570
after she says he threatened
and stalked her.

893
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:38,989
And she blames him for
an altercation with Nikolas

894
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,884
that left her with a broken arm.

895
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:43,118
I don't want to call him.

896
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,912
I don't want to talk with him.

897
00:50:44,913 --> 00:50:46,413
I don't want to, uh...

898
00:50:46,414 --> 00:50:49,291
All because he treats
his brother so badly.

899
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:06,266
What the fuck?

900
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:08,189
Where the fuck am I?

901
00:51:14,108 --> 00:51:15,275
Yo,

902
00:51:15,276 --> 00:51:16,155
where you going?

903
00:51:19,155 --> 00:51:20,861
Fuck.

904
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,534
Yo, where the fuck am I, man?

905
00:51:23,535 --> 00:51:24,618
Did you do this
to my fucking face?

906
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:26,119
Shut the fuck up.
Lower your voice.

907
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,039
No. Back the fuck up, man.
Back the fuck up.

908
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,624
- Listen! Stop it!
- Get the fuck off me!

909
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:31,792
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Ow!

910
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:33,210
Ow, my fucking arm!

911
00:51:33,211 --> 00:51:35,212
Ow! My fucking hand
and handcuff!

912
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:36,672
- Shut up!
- Ow!

913
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:38,840
- Get the fuck off me!
- Stop yelling!

914
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:41,677
- Shut up!
- My whole fucking body hurts.

915
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,470
Yo, C, can you get some
painkillers, please?

916
00:51:43,471 --> 00:51:45,138
You do this shit to me, bro?

917
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:46,057
Now! Now!

918
00:51:46,058 --> 00:51:47,391
Did you do this shit to me?

919
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:48,850
Shut the fuck up.
If you wake the grandma,

920
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:49,868
I swear to God I'll fuck you up.

921
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:51,144
What fucking grandma?

922
00:51:51,145 --> 00:51:52,813
You're in an old lady's
house in Rego Park.

923
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:54,022
- Are you gonna stay quiet?
- How the fuck did I

924
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:55,482
- get here, bro?
- Calm down.

925
00:51:55,483 --> 00:51:56,692
- Calm down.
- Fuck. All right.

926
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:58,068
Get off. I'm calm.

927
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:59,820
- All right. Calm down.
- All right.

928
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:03,299
So get the fuck off.

929
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:04,575
Thank you.

930
00:52:04,576 --> 00:52:06,783
- Yo, take these.
- What the fuck is that?

931
00:52:06,797 --> 00:52:08,297
- What is it?
- Oxys.

932
00:52:08,298 --> 00:52:09,840
Take it. Take it.

933
00:52:09,841 --> 00:52:12,027
They'll make you feel better.

934
00:52:12,052 --> 00:52:13,803
Are you gonna stay calm?

935
00:52:13,804 --> 00:52:15,304
Can you leave us alone, please?

936
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:16,806
Dude, why do I have handcuffs?

937
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:18,140
Just go down to your room.

938
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:19,725
Shut the door. Shut the door.

939
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:21,703
Close the door!

940
00:52:21,728 --> 00:52:23,062
- Fuck!
- I swear to God,

941
00:52:23,063 --> 00:52:24,146
if you wake up the grandmother,

942
00:52:24,147 --> 00:52:25,314
- I'll fuck you up!
- Yeah, yeah.

943
00:52:25,315 --> 00:52:26,857
I heard you, bro.

944
00:52:26,858 --> 00:52:28,317
- God damn it.
- Are you gonna stay calm?

945
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:30,986
Yeah, yeah, I'm calm.

946
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:32,154
Fuck.

947
00:52:32,155 --> 00:52:34,144
Christ, man.

948
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:47,712
What the fuck is going on?
Why am I in handcuffs?

949
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:49,505
You were handcuffed
to a stretcher in a hospital.

950
00:52:49,506 --> 00:52:50,756
I broke the wrong guy out.

951
00:52:50,757 --> 00:52:51,841
- That's all I know.
- Hospital?

952
00:52:51,842 --> 00:52:52,883
Yeah.

953
00:52:52,884 --> 00:52:53,844
There was a cop
outside your room.

954
00:52:53,845 --> 00:52:55,386
- What?
- I fucked up.

955
00:52:55,387 --> 00:52:57,346
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to tell you.

956
00:52:57,347 --> 00:53:00,516
There was a cop outside your
room and you're the wrong guy.

957
00:53:00,517 --> 00:53:02,268
Well, what the fuck
am I going to do?

958
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:03,853
You can do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

959
00:53:03,854 --> 00:53:05,396
What you can't do
is fuck my shit up.

960
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:07,732
Acting stupid and getting me
thrown out. Okay?

961
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:09,083
All right, well listen.
Get me a phone, man.

962
00:53:09,108 --> 00:53:10,001
I gotta make some phone calls.

963
00:53:10,026 --> 00:53:11,401
I don't have a fucking phone.

964
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:14,196
Well, go get one
from that fucking girl then.

965
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:00,992
All right.

966
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:02,619
We need to go back
to the hospital.

967
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,079
Is your brother okay?

968
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,914
That's not my brother.
The hospital fucked up.

969
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:07,916
Who is that upstairs?

970
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:09,126
I don't know who it is.

971
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:10,419
The hospital fucked up.
It's not my fault.

972
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,586
Does the car

973
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:12,838
- in the driveway work?
- Yeah.

974
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:13,839
Do you know where the keys are?

975
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,983
No.

976
00:54:15,008 --> 00:54:16,090
Well, where could they be?
Can we just go

977
00:54:16,091 --> 00:54:17,092
and look for them quickly?

978
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:21,179
Hurry up, get some shit on
and go find the keys.

979
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,639
Fuck, man.

980
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,765
Don't be confused.

981
00:54:23,766 --> 00:54:26,133
It's just gonna
make it worse for me.

982
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,373
Fuck.

983
00:54:47,373 --> 00:54:48,498
Yo, yo!

984
00:54:48,499 --> 00:54:49,624
What?

985
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,126
I'm leaving.
You gotta leave too.

986
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:52,502
- Let's go.
- Can I get a ride?

987
00:54:52,503 --> 00:54:53,628
Yeah. Whatever.

988
00:54:53,629 --> 00:54:54,963
I gotta make
a phone call, too, bro.

989
00:54:54,964 --> 00:54:56,214
- Please.
- Fine, fine.

990
00:54:56,215 --> 00:54:57,299
Just don't say anything stupid
in front of her.

991
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,342
I won't say nothing stupid.

992
00:54:58,343 --> 00:54:59,676
And clean that shit
off your face.

993
00:54:59,677 --> 00:55:01,178
What the fuck do you think
I'm trying to do here?

994
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:04,282
- You're gonna scare her.
- Get me that phone!

995
00:55:04,307 --> 00:55:05,578
Fuck, man.

996
00:55:33,378 --> 00:55:34,564
Oh, shit!

997
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:42,041
Oh, it's probably
just some bullshit.

998
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:33,964
Hey, Ron, it's me.

999
00:56:33,965 --> 00:56:36,592
Listen, I'll explain later.
Are you with Mom right now?

1000
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:37,968
All right, listen.

1001
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:40,262
Is there anybody else in the
room with you right now?

1002
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,638
Oh, fuck.

1003
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,932
Listen, listen, when I get
off the phone with you,

1004
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:44,933
you gotta pretend

1005
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,143
like you just got off the phone

1006
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:47,603
with one of your friends
or something, all right?

1007
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,521
All right,
it's really important.

1008
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:51,481
I gotta call you back later
from a different phone.

1009
00:56:51,482 --> 00:56:52,774
I'll explain everything.
All right?

1010
00:56:52,775 --> 00:56:54,359
All right, I love you, bro.

1011
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,781
Bye.

1012
00:56:58,315 --> 00:56:59,733
Whoa, whoa.
Why are we going back

1013
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:01,571
to the hospital for?

1014
00:57:01,596 --> 00:57:02,637
I thought that's
where you wanted to go.

1015
00:57:02,638 --> 00:57:04,639
Are you fucking crazy?

1016
00:57:18,426 --> 00:57:20,079
All right.

1017
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:22,509
I'm gonna drop you off
at that White Castle.

1018
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,112
I gotta get something
for my brother, anyway.

1019
00:57:41,552 --> 00:57:42,635
Yo, could you run in and get

1020
00:57:42,636 --> 00:57:44,262
a number 5 six-piece
chicken thing?

1021
00:57:44,263 --> 00:57:45,888
All right.

1022
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:47,598
Get me something too.

1023
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,724
I'm starving.

1024
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:50,563
Just a couple sliders, please.

1025
00:57:52,563 --> 00:57:53,938
Go ahead.

1026
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:55,648
Give me my phone.

1027
00:57:55,649 --> 00:57:58,151
- Here.
- No, no, leave that in here.

1028
00:57:58,152 --> 00:57:59,327
I wanna use it.

1029
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:08,744
All right, bro. She's gone.

1030
00:58:08,745 --> 00:58:10,621
Let's get the fuck out of
here! Let's fucking book it.

1031
00:58:10,622 --> 00:58:11,956
Driving around in a stolen car?

1032
00:58:11,957 --> 00:58:13,749
Don't be a fucking idiot.

1033
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,418
We're waiting for her here.

1034
00:58:15,419 --> 00:58:17,420
Well, I guess I'm gonna stay
in the car, too, then, man.

1035
00:58:17,421 --> 00:58:19,088
Because you've seen
how it is back there.

1036
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:21,150
All those fucking cops.

1037
00:58:21,175 --> 00:58:22,129
And there's fucking cops

1038
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:24,635
at my house. I don't think
you understand, bro.

1039
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:27,096
I just got out
of prison yesterday.

1040
00:58:27,097 --> 00:58:28,598
I'm on fucking parole.

1041
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:29,682
I'm fucked.

1042
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:31,100
I'm gonna end up back in jail.

1043
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:33,686
I am not going back to jail!

1044
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:36,748
And these fucking pills
aren't doing shit.

1045
00:58:36,773 --> 00:58:39,984
Man, this is all
a bunch of fucking

1046
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:41,194
bullshit, man!

1047
00:58:41,195 --> 00:58:43,321
Shut the fuck up.
I'm trying to think.

1048
00:58:43,322 --> 00:58:44,363
Okay?

1049
00:58:44,364 --> 00:58:45,615
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

1050
00:58:45,616 --> 00:58:47,825
I'm trying to fucking
figure out my shit, too.

1051
00:58:47,826 --> 00:58:50,661
I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do.

1052
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:53,621
I don't remember half the shit
that went on yesterday.

1053
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,697
I don't know if I ended up
in the hospital first.

1054
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,865
Or the precinct first.

1055
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,992
I don't know
if they got my fingerprints.

1056
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,869
I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

1057
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,995
And I don't remember half of it

1058
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,250
because I was so
goddamned fucked up!

1059
00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:09,755
I remember being
dropped off by a bus.

1060
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:11,776
The jail releases me,
the bus drops me off

1061
00:59:11,777 --> 00:59:14,362
right in front of
a liquor store on the corner.

1062
00:59:14,363 --> 00:59:15,822
I mean, after doing
two years in jail,

1063
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:18,283
what the fuck do you think
is gonna happen, man?

1064
00:59:18,284 --> 00:59:21,161
I'm gonna want a fucking drink.

1065
00:59:21,162 --> 00:59:22,662
Right away I'm getting
a bottle of brandy.

1066
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:24,122
I'm already practically broke,

1067
00:59:24,123 --> 00:59:26,430
with the little money
that was left in my account.

1068
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:27,867
So I call my boy, Caliph.

1069
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,536
He comes through
with some more liquor.

1070
00:59:29,537 --> 00:59:30,662
Your boy's home, man.

1071
00:59:30,663 --> 00:59:32,330
And some sticks of Xanax.

1072
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:33,707
My brother!

1073
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:36,209
He takes some sticks.
I take some sticks.

1074
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,128
And by now, we're all fucked up.

1075
00:59:38,129 --> 00:59:41,297
And I'm just feeling so good
that I don't even give a fuck.

1076
00:59:41,298 --> 00:59:43,842
So we both walk over
to his boy Trevor's house.

1077
00:59:43,843 --> 00:59:44,218
This guy who has
this hustle going

1078
00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:48,805
where he moves acid
for this guy in the Bronx

1079
00:59:48,806 --> 00:59:49,973
to this other guy
in Long Island.

1080
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,141
But what they do is,

1081
00:59:51,142 --> 00:59:52,559
they skim a couple
of sheets off the top,

1082
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,060
you know, so they could
have some money

1083
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:56,724
on the side for themselves
before they make the delivery.

1084
00:59:56,749 --> 01:00:00,686
Yo, Bells, Belvis,
how much was that?

1085
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:02,951
Yo, son, hook me up, son.

1086
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,729
Finish her. You're a
three-minute man anyway.

1087
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,814
Fuck, let me do my thing, man.

1088
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:11,736
So I ride with him
to Long Island,

1089
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:12,862
and I'm thinking the whole time

1090
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:15,406
this PO's gonna
read me the riot act,

1091
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:18,325
'cause I'm fucking up already,
but, I mean...

1092
01:00:18,326 --> 01:00:19,744
I'm feeling so great,
and I'm fucked up.

1093
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:22,163
And I just don't give a fuck.
I'm celebrating.

1094
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:23,497
I'm not gonna spill it.

1095
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:25,374
Yo, how much is this shit worth?

1096
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,877
So I'm at the arcade
with Trevor now.

1097
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:30,212
You know, we're doing
our thing, hustling acid.

1098
01:00:30,213 --> 01:00:31,881
And, you know,
we take over this place.

1099
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:33,883
Like it's our fucking office.

1100
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:36,092
Once in a while
someone will show up

1101
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:37,678
and we'll make a sale, you know.

1102
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,597
Make a sale here.
Make a sale there.

1103
01:00:39,598 --> 01:00:41,432
Twenty? You know...

1104
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:43,184
Take that shit
and get high, baby boy.

1105
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:45,352
A little stronger
than last time, I hope.

1106
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:47,039
But then,
one of Trevor's friends,

1107
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,583
this clown Donnie walks in.

1108
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:50,858
And he's all fucked up.

1109
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:52,276
And he's talking about

1110
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:55,571
how he just robbed some
Radio Shack down the street.

1111
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:57,364
Look, check this out.

1112
01:00:57,365 --> 01:00:58,365
At this point,

1113
01:00:58,366 --> 01:00:59,742
the acid's kicking in for me,

1114
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:04,038
so I can't follow this shit.
I'm having a hard time

1115
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,748
following the story,

1116
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,249
and I'm starting
to freak out a little bit.

1117
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,751
Bam! Right over
his fucking head.

1118
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:11,462
And then, guess what happens?
The fucking cops show up.

1119
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:12,713
And the next thing I know,

1120
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:14,548
Trevor's grabbing me,
and we just book it into

1121
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:15,716
the parking lot.

1122
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:16,967
And I just remember thinking
I could run

1123
01:01:16,968 --> 01:01:18,886
for, like, 20 miles straight.

1124
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,531
It's here, right here.

1125
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:24,308
So I'm following Trevor,
and it's fucking freezing.

1126
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:25,559
He leads us into Adventureland,

1127
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,037
this amusement park.

1128
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:30,731
At this point, I have no idea
what the fuck is going on.

1129
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:32,400
And then Donnie leads us
into this ride,

1130
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:33,984
and they look for a place
to hide their shit.

1131
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:35,236
But it's fuckin' dark in there.

1132
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:36,654
I can't see shit.

1133
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:38,572
All of a sudden,
they get bagged,

1134
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:40,241
I'm all by myself in the dark.

1135
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:42,118
And literally
the next thing I remember is,

1136
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,913
I'm fucking running down
some random street.

1137
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:48,249
And I just see a fucking cab.

1138
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,418
And I hail it,
and I just get in.

1139
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:52,670
And this driver,
he just kept talking to me

1140
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:55,256
and talking to me, and
I'm fucking tripping balls.

1141
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:56,924
And I'm telling him,
"Please, please."

1142
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:57,759
"Just give me
some peace and quiet,"

1143
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,260
"or I'm going to throw up."

1144
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,470
If you're going to throw up,
you give me my money right now

1145
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,930
and you get out of this car.

1146
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,139
And I told the driver,

1147
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,933
"Don't worry.
I'm going to go in the house,"

1148
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:07,435
"I'll get the money
from my bag."

1149
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:09,478
I just got out of jail today,
man. I don't have shit.

1150
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:12,940
As soon as he hears the word
"jail," he fuckin' freaks.

1151
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,316
Talking about, "Oh,
I'm not getting ripped off"

1152
01:02:14,317 --> 01:02:15,818
"by one of you punks again."

1153
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:18,028
- I am not getting fucked over!
- And he just fucking

1154
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:19,447
steps on the gas,

1155
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:21,615
and that was it.
He just takes off.

1156
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:23,868
I'm gonna pay you. My mother's
gonna pay you. She has money.

1157
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,286
I'm going to the police, okay!

1158
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:28,497
Man, I heard the word
"cops," and I lose it.

1159
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:30,332
I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

1160
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,125
- Pull over. Fuck this.
- You are crazy!

1161
01:02:32,126 --> 01:02:33,878
I'm not going back to jail, man.

1162
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:36,797
I'm not going back to jail.
God damn it!

1163
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:37,965
So I happen to get
one of the doors opened

1164
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:39,550
before he locked them all.

1165
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:41,343
This guy's crazy.
He's fucking driving.

1166
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:43,137
He's speeding down the road,

1167
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:45,347
30, 40 miles an hour.

1168
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:46,640
And I know we're getting

1169
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:48,017
closer and closer
to the precinct.

1170
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:50,144
I know where my local
precinct is. It's not far.

1171
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:52,563
And I am not going back to jail.

1172
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:55,986
So I just looked down at
the pavement and just jump.

1173
01:02:57,986 --> 01:02:59,695
And now look at my fucking face!

1174
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:03,034
I can't go walk around
looking like this.

1175
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:06,706
Yo. Yo, you listening to me?

1176
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:12,001
Yo, you fucking hear me?

1177
01:03:12,991 --> 01:03:13,879
Yo.

1178
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:18,841
Fucking serious? Hello?

1179
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:21,011
Hello!

1180
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,678
Tell you what I think.

1181
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,222
I'm gonna drive us
out there right now,

1182
01:03:26,223 --> 01:03:28,015
gonna go through the ride,
and we split what we find.

1183
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:29,058
All right?

1184
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:30,518
What, to Adventurers?
Right now?

1185
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:32,023
Yes.

1186
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:36,524
Are you fucking serious?

1187
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:38,943
I should be in a fucking bed
somewhere right now.

1188
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:41,529
You have nowhere to go.
You have no plan.

1189
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,366
And she's coming right now.

1190
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:54,875
Did you see all the activity

1191
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:56,544
outside the hospital
when we drove past?

1192
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:58,128
Yeah, the police?

1193
01:03:58,129 --> 01:03:59,380
Yeah. So I called over there,

1194
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:01,549
and there's been
a police incident.

1195
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:03,718
They're not going to discharge
anyone for an hour and a half.

1196
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:05,386
So what's going to happen
with your brother?

1197
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:06,055
I don't know.
It's fuckin' nightmare.

1198
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:08,389
I'm kinda fucked.

1199
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,974
So I want to drop him off
back at home,

1200
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:11,937
then come back
to the hospital afterwards.

1201
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,233
So I'm gonna drop you off
back at home, right?

1202
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:19,902
Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

1203
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:22,907
Yeah, drive me home.

1204
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:11,869
Where am I going?

1205
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,037
Yeah, just right up here.

1206
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:15,166
Just pull up
around back right here.

1207
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:17,166
Right here?

1208
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,126
Yeah, just pull up around back.

1209
01:05:18,127 --> 01:05:19,460
I don't want to go around front

1210
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:21,212
because then the dogs
are going to start barking

1211
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:22,722
and wake everybody up
and stuff. So...

1212
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:33,729
Get out for a second.
I need to talk to her.

1213
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:47,488
You know what? Tonight,
it's fucked up as it is.

1214
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:49,716
I just think...

1215
01:05:51,243 --> 01:05:53,052
I think something
very important is happening,

1216
01:05:53,077 --> 01:05:54,703
and it's deeply connected
to my purpose.

1217
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:55,913
And I think that

1218
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:58,919
you are somehow
connected to it as well.

1219
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:02,019
I mean, do you feel me at all?

1220
01:06:02,044 --> 01:06:04,087
Or do I just sound
like a total faggot?

1221
01:06:04,088 --> 01:06:06,095
No, I feel you. I understand.

1222
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:13,222
Okay, I'm gonna go take a shit
in that guy's house.

1223
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:15,933
And we'll try the hospital
again in a minute.

1224
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,407
- Just wait here for me, okay?
- All right.

1225
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:33,117
We can cut right through here.

1226
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:53,763
Oh, fuck. Ow!

1227
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:56,640
Ow, my fucking shoulder!

1228
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:59,226
Power with your legs.
Don't use your arms.

1229
01:06:59,227 --> 01:07:02,438
- Oh, fuck. Shit, man.
- Shut the fuck up!

1230
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:03,773
I can't do it, man.

1231
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:05,149
Tell me where it is.
I'll be right back.

1232
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,275
I'm not telling you where it is.

1233
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:07,568
You can wait by the car.

1234
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:09,236
That's my ride as well as yours.

1235
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:10,404
No, no, no way.
We find another way

1236
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:11,572
around or something.

1237
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,050
If I have to come back
over there,

1238
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:14,825
I'm gonna kick
the living shit out of you.

1239
01:07:14,826 --> 01:07:16,452
You keep pushing me, bro,
and I'm gonna

1240
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,829
forget how fucked up
my shoulder is.

1241
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,581
Motherfucker.

1242
01:07:29,925 --> 01:07:31,991
You gotta help me over, bro.

1243
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:34,428
Come on.

1244
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:36,263
Just boost me up.

1245
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:37,100
Go.

1246
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,102
There we go.

1247
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:41,314
Go.

1248
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:45,817
I'm good.

1249
01:07:46,817 --> 01:07:48,109
Oh!

1250
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,154
Fuck me, bro!

1251
01:07:51,154 --> 01:07:52,698
Oh, shit!

1252
01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:55,868
Fuck!

1253
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:57,476
Here we go.

1254
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:23,310
All right, you feel
this track right here?

1255
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:24,523
- Yes.
- Follow it.

1256
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:27,316
Um...

1257
01:08:28,316 --> 01:08:30,320
Yo, check this coffin.

1258
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,404
Where?

1259
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:35,660
Everywhere.
Behind it, under it.

1260
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,827
There's nothing here, man.

1261
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:41,873
Try lifting the lid up.

1262
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:44,373
This is fucking bolted down.

1263
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:45,916
Look, I'm not gonna spend
all night looking through

1264
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,877
everything single thing in
here, so think, think harder.

1265
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:49,170
All right. I'm trying
to fucking think, bro!

1266
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:51,672
It was fucking dark,
like it is now.

1267
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:53,007
It's gotta be farther,
let's go father.

1268
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:54,175
Come on.

1269
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:55,182
Fuck.

1270
01:09:00,182 --> 01:09:02,600
Right. Got it.

1271
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:04,852
This Egyptian shit.

1272
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:07,605
I don't know.
Maybe this tombstone, man.

1273
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:09,871
I think they stashed it here.

1274
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,697
- Oh, shit!
- You got it?

1275
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:20,367
Yes! Nah,
I found the fucking acid.

1276
01:09:20,368 --> 01:09:21,535
I don't care about the acid.

1277
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:22,703
Are you fucking stupid?

1278
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:23,954
Do you know how much
this shit is worth?

1279
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:25,292
Find the money.

1280
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:28,876
Do you recognize any of this?

1281
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,753
I told you, man.
I was fucked up.

1282
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:31,962
The cops came in quick.

1283
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:34,053
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!

1284
01:09:39,053 --> 01:09:40,724
Y'all need to come out.

1285
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:45,476
Stop fucking with me right now.

1286
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:47,567
I already called the cops.

1287
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:54,568
Yo!

1288
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:55,613
Stop playin'.

1289
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:58,955
Y'all need
to come out right now.

1290
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:06,932
If I find you,

1291
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,430
you gonna get your ass kicked.

1292
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,433
I'm not fucking around.

1293
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:25,690
Show your face.

1294
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,423
Hey!

1295
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,778
Oh, fuck!

1296
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,365
Shit. Fuck! Ow!

1297
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:42,533
Hey! Calm down!

1298
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:43,951
Hey!

1299
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,703
- Ow. Fuck!
- Hey!

1300
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:49,710
I got beat up!
I'm the victim here, man.

1301
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,923
Oh, shit.

1302
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:55,671
Where's your friend?

1303
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:58,632
- I don't got no friend.
- I saw you on the monitor!

1304
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:00,843
There's cameras here, okay?

1305
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:03,721
I got beat up. I'm the victim.
Look at me, man.

1306
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:05,139
Oh, come on, bro.

1307
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,034
I'm gonna show
your friend now, huh?

1308
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,642
I'm not trying
to give you no problems, man.

1309
01:11:08,643 --> 01:11:09,685
All right.

1310
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,037
Let's wait for your boy
to come out.

1311
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:12,146
Just let me go.
You will never see

1312
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:13,481
my face again, I promise.

1313
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:14,815
Let's wait for your boy
to come out now.

1314
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:16,525
Please, man. Come on, bro.

1315
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:17,659
Shut the fuck up.

1316
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:25,749
There he goes.

1317
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:31,709
Hey!

1318
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,003
Hey!

1319
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,215
Yo!

1320
01:11:47,489 --> 01:11:48,990
Oh, shit!

1321
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,242
Come on! Come on!

1322
01:11:51,243 --> 01:11:53,661
Get me the fuck outta here!

1323
01:11:53,662 --> 01:11:55,246
Yo! Yo!

1324
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:56,666
Open the door!

1325
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,250
Yo, cut me the fuck
out of these things, man.

1326
01:11:59,251 --> 01:12:01,510
There's got to be
scissors somewhere.

1327
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,679
Let me see those things.

1328
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:12,109
Shit.

1329
01:12:15,184 --> 01:12:16,562
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1330
01:12:36,622 --> 01:12:38,289
All right, let's leave him here.

1331
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,415
Keep looking.

1332
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:40,583
Go find it.

1333
01:12:40,584 --> 01:12:42,043
I want to be in and out of here.

1334
01:12:42,044 --> 01:12:43,545
Damn you fucked him up.

1335
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:45,755
I want to be in and out,
all right? In and out!

1336
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:50,718
Yo, does any of this
black light shit ring a bell?

1337
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:51,761
I don't know, man.

1338
01:12:51,762 --> 01:12:53,555
Just look around.
Look under shit.

1339
01:12:53,556 --> 01:12:55,640
Look behind shit,
like I'm doing.

1340
01:12:55,641 --> 01:12:56,766
The cops came in.

1341
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:59,394
They stashed it
really quick, man.

1342
01:13:00,938 --> 01:13:03,147
- What about the boat thing?
- The what?

1343
01:13:03,148 --> 01:13:05,149
The boat. Did you look
through the boat?

1344
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,901
Nah, not yet.

1345
01:13:25,963 --> 01:13:27,841
Hello!

1346
01:13:30,092 --> 01:13:33,264
Hello! Nassau County Police.
Anybody in there?

1347
01:13:35,264 --> 01:13:36,942
Fuck! Fuck!

1348
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:48,114
Nassau County Police!

1349
01:13:52,114 --> 01:13:52,866
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1350
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:55,325
Shit, man.

1351
01:13:55,326 --> 01:13:56,472
Take his shoes off!

1352
01:14:16,472 --> 01:14:18,806
Go look for a hiding spot.
Don't leave the ride.

1353
01:14:18,807 --> 01:14:20,475
Hold on, hold on.

1354
01:14:20,476 --> 01:14:22,060
This motherfucker's
not gonna remember shit

1355
01:14:22,061 --> 01:14:23,144
when he wakes up.

1356
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:24,375
Open the fucking mouth.

1357
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:45,667
Oh, there you are.

1358
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:46,917
What happened?
We were yelling at the gate.

1359
01:14:46,918 --> 01:14:48,169
Sorry, man,
I couldn't hear anything.

1360
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,092
He's inside here.

1361
01:14:53,092 --> 01:14:55,478
Watch out for the rail.

1362
01:14:57,328 --> 01:14:59,121
- He's just here.
- Oh, shit.

1363
01:14:59,122 --> 01:15:00,622
What happened to him?

1364
01:15:00,623 --> 01:15:01,707
I don't know.

1365
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:02,833
I just heard
a ton of noise outside.

1366
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:03,959
I just walked in here,

1367
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,043
and he's just
layin' there like this...

1368
01:15:05,044 --> 01:15:06,004
Unconscious, I guess.

1369
01:15:06,005 --> 01:15:07,462
What happened to the other one?

1370
01:15:07,463 --> 01:15:08,714
- Could we get a bus for a...
- The other one...

1371
01:15:08,715 --> 01:15:10,132
...lacerations to the face.

1372
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:11,967
As soon as I turned the lights
on, everybody ran off.

1373
01:15:11,968 --> 01:15:13,802
Is he still in the park?

1374
01:15:13,803 --> 01:15:15,137
Maybe. I don't know.

1375
01:15:15,138 --> 01:15:16,281
You have an ETA?

1376
01:15:16,306 --> 01:15:17,514
I'm gonna need you to turn all

1377
01:15:17,515 --> 01:15:19,182
- the lights on in the park.
- Copy.

1378
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:21,727
Uh... Yeah, just give me
a couple of minutes.

1379
01:15:38,161 --> 01:15:39,411
Hold on.

1380
01:15:39,412 --> 01:15:40,495
Let me call you back, hold on.

1381
01:15:40,496 --> 01:15:42,501
'Cause I just peeped something.

1382
01:15:59,849 --> 01:16:01,659
Yo, yo, yo.

1383
01:16:01,684 --> 01:16:04,561
Stop! Stop! Turn around.

1384
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:06,027
Turn around.

1385
01:16:11,027 --> 01:16:14,863
Nice strong pulse.
He has a good chest rise.

1386
01:16:14,864 --> 01:16:16,365
He's moving good oxygen.

1387
01:16:16,366 --> 01:16:19,284
Those whacks are pretty nasty
on his forehead though.

1388
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:22,871
Hey, bud. Hey. Hey.
What's going on, man? Hey.

1389
01:16:22,872 --> 01:16:25,374
You awake? Hello. Hello.

1390
01:16:27,794 --> 01:16:31,379
He's a little agitated.
Hold on. Hold on to him.

1391
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,547
Hey, man, it's all right.

1392
01:16:32,548 --> 01:16:37,028
It's all right.
Relax. Relax. Relax.

1393
01:16:37,053 --> 01:16:38,595
There goes that drug use, huh?

1394
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,432
Just hold on to his legs.

1395
01:16:42,433 --> 01:16:44,142
Make sure you got his legs.

1396
01:16:44,143 --> 01:16:45,727
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1397
01:16:45,728 --> 01:16:46,895
- I'm gonna cuff him.
- Yeah, yeah.

1398
01:16:46,896 --> 01:16:47,896
Let's restrain him.

1399
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:51,400
Relax,
you're gonna be all right.

1400
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:53,568
Relax.
All right, I got his arms.

1401
01:16:53,569 --> 01:16:54,778
You get under.

1402
01:16:54,779 --> 01:16:58,716
Take your time.
One. Two. Three.

1403
01:16:58,741 --> 01:17:01,413
All right, let's put him
on a stretcher.

1404
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:07,249
All right.

1405
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,333
Get off of me!

1406
01:17:08,334 --> 01:17:09,501
Why are you still
holding me, sir?

1407
01:17:09,502 --> 01:17:10,754
Get off!

1408
01:17:11,754 --> 01:17:14,506
Get off! Get off of me!

1409
01:17:14,507 --> 01:17:16,174
Wait, I just
explained myself to you.

1410
01:17:16,175 --> 01:17:17,277
I didn't have to do that.

1411
01:17:17,302 --> 01:17:18,427
You're not making any sense.

1412
01:17:22,098 --> 01:17:24,071
This is the girl.

1413
01:17:26,445 --> 01:17:27,739
Yo!

1414
01:17:28,317 --> 01:17:30,530
Is this the one
that was running around?

1415
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:35,240
Nah, it wasn't a girl, bro.

1416
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:36,658
I don't know who that is.

1417
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:38,326
Look me at, don't look at him.

1418
01:17:38,327 --> 01:17:40,328
Look at me. How old are you?

1419
01:17:40,329 --> 01:17:42,497
- I'm 16.
- Where's your ID?

1420
01:17:42,498 --> 01:17:43,581
What are you doing here?

1421
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:45,166
You don't want...
You don't know, and

1422
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:48,211
you don't want to talk to me?
Come on. You're outta here.

1423
01:17:48,212 --> 01:17:50,383
I don't got time for this shit.

1424
01:17:52,118 --> 01:17:53,285
We'll find somebody
that'll talk to us

1425
01:17:53,286 --> 01:17:55,849
and tell you why
you're here, all right?

1426
01:17:57,081 --> 01:18:00,176
Get her outta here.
I'll start her 61.

1427
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:10,760
Elmhurst, can I help you?

1428
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:12,971
Yeah. I'm just
looking for a patient

1429
01:18:12,972 --> 01:18:14,097
who's currently in the hospital.

1430
01:18:14,098 --> 01:18:15,515
I'm just checking
to see if he's okay.

1431
01:18:15,516 --> 01:18:16,683
Name, please.

1432
01:18:16,684 --> 01:18:18,810
Nikolas. Nikolas Nikas.

1433
01:18:18,811 --> 01:18:20,812
N-I-K-A-S.

1434
01:18:20,813 --> 01:18:23,607
N-I-K-A-S.

1435
01:18:23,608 --> 01:18:25,358
Do you have a floor
or wing or something?

1436
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:27,444
No. No, I don't know anything.

1437
01:18:27,445 --> 01:18:29,526
All right, please hold.

1438
01:18:48,299 --> 01:18:49,674
Hello?

1439
01:18:49,675 --> 01:18:50,800
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1440
01:18:50,801 --> 01:18:52,636
I'm unable to release
any information

1441
01:18:52,637 --> 01:18:53,678
regarding that inmate.

1442
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,472
Why not? I'm a family member.

1443
01:18:55,473 --> 01:18:57,182
Like I said, I'm not allowed

1444
01:18:57,183 --> 01:19:00,028
to release or to disclose
any information about...

1445
01:19:09,028 --> 01:19:11,088
Yo!

1446
01:19:14,242 --> 01:19:16,576
- Yo!
- Yeah.

1447
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:18,221
We're leavin'.

1448
01:19:18,246 --> 01:19:21,089
Yo, are we good, man?
Are they gone?

1449
01:19:28,089 --> 01:19:30,142
Yo, wait up!

1450
01:20:02,247 --> 01:20:03,957
Let me in.

1451
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,041
You have the acid?

1452
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:06,561
Yeah.

1453
01:20:06,586 --> 01:20:09,498
Get in the back.

1454
01:20:14,802 --> 01:20:16,236
I gotta get
to a fucking phone, man.

1455
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:17,721
I gotta warn my family.

1456
01:20:17,722 --> 01:20:19,389
If they call that fucking
stupid girl's number back...

1457
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,932
If she's with the cops,

1458
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:22,392
then I'm fucked, bro.

1459
01:20:22,393 --> 01:20:24,060
They might trick my mom
into saying something stupid,

1460
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:27,065
like I...
Like I called her earlier.

1461
01:20:28,065 --> 01:20:29,232
Fuck, man.

1462
01:20:29,233 --> 01:20:31,276
Lay down.

1463
01:20:31,277 --> 01:20:32,903
We're going to his house.

1464
01:20:32,904 --> 01:20:36,153
Lay down.
Make yourself invisible.

1465
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:17,187
- What apartment?
- 12B.

1466
01:22:30,187 --> 01:22:31,354
Hello?

1467
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:38,445
Hello?

1468
01:23:02,637 --> 01:23:03,720
Hey.

1469
01:23:03,721 --> 01:23:05,641
Come here.

1470
01:23:07,975 --> 01:23:09,643
Smell the coat.
Smell the coat.

1471
01:23:09,644 --> 01:23:11,061
Smell that. Go on.

1472
01:23:11,062 --> 01:23:13,396
You smell it? You smell it?

1473
01:23:13,397 --> 01:23:14,983
Come here, come here.

1474
01:23:15,601 --> 01:23:16,685
Come on.

1475
01:23:36,459 --> 01:23:37,834
...getting $46 million

1476
01:23:37,835 --> 01:23:40,133
in funding for
upgraded infrastructure.

1477
01:23:44,133 --> 01:23:47,218
...35,000 feet of new sewers,
water mains, and sidewalks.

1478
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:49,877
Shit, that's what
I'm talking about.

1479
01:23:51,307 --> 01:23:53,141
Man, this is a nice
fucking place.

1480
01:23:53,142 --> 01:23:55,852
I wish I had
a fucking place like this.

1481
01:24:05,363 --> 01:24:06,571
How much money
can you get for this

1482
01:24:06,572 --> 01:24:08,573
- right now, tonight?
- What?

1483
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:10,825
For the acid. Who can you call
to get some money for this

1484
01:24:10,826 --> 01:24:11,993
right now tonight?

1485
01:24:11,994 --> 01:24:13,661
I want to move it right now.

1486
01:24:13,662 --> 01:24:14,829
That doesn't belong to me.

1487
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,498
That belongs to my boy, Caliph.

1488
01:24:16,499 --> 01:24:18,333
Well, then he can pay me for it.

1489
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:19,667
Fuck that, man.
I'm the one who found it.

1490
01:24:19,668 --> 01:24:20,877
Not you.

1491
01:24:20,878 --> 01:24:22,212
You wouldn't have found
anything without me.

1492
01:24:22,213 --> 01:24:24,673
You were handcuffed
to a bed in a hospital.

1493
01:24:24,674 --> 01:24:25,840
What do you think
I'm doing this for?

1494
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:27,217
You think I'm doing this
for charity?

1495
01:24:27,218 --> 01:24:30,887
All right. You're right.
You got a point. I hear you.

1496
01:24:30,888 --> 01:24:32,347
Listen. My boy
will hook you up.

1497
01:24:32,348 --> 01:24:33,682
He'll throw some money your way.

1498
01:24:33,683 --> 01:24:35,016
But, my point is,

1499
01:24:35,017 --> 01:24:36,267
it's not up to me.
I gotta call him, all right?

1500
01:24:36,268 --> 01:24:37,352
- It's not up to me.
- You're right.

1501
01:24:37,353 --> 01:24:38,603
It's not up to you.

1502
01:24:38,604 --> 01:24:41,022
So get on the phone
and call him right now.

1503
01:24:41,023 --> 01:24:43,000
Plug the phone in. Charge it.

1504
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:43,901
And give me a minute.

1505
01:24:43,902 --> 01:24:44,943
It doesn't need to be charged.

1506
01:24:44,944 --> 01:24:46,027
I want to relax
for a minute, man.

1507
01:24:46,028 --> 01:24:47,237
It's been a long
fucking night, you know.

1508
01:24:47,238 --> 01:24:48,571
I don't give a fuck
if you want to relax.

1509
01:24:48,572 --> 01:24:49,948
You gotta get on the phone
right now, and you gotta

1510
01:24:49,949 --> 01:24:51,366
make sure it's plugged
into the wall 'cause

1511
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:52,867
- otherwise it doesn't work.
- Give me a minute, bro.

1512
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:53,625
Goddamn.

1513
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:01,380
Call him now.

1514
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,464
A Bronx man is
facing animal cruelty charges.

1515
01:25:06,465 --> 01:25:09,050
Officials say an anonymous tip
about emaciated dogs prompted

1516
01:25:09,051 --> 01:25:11,219
an investigation
by law enforcement.

1517
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,721
They will soon
be available for adoption.

1518
01:25:12,722 --> 01:25:13,888
Now an update

1519
01:25:13,889 --> 01:25:15,390
on last week's
bank robbery in Flushing.

1520
01:25:15,391 --> 01:25:16,891
Authorities are still
searching for.

1521
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:19,394
Constantine Nikas, suspected
of carrying out the robbery

1522
01:25:19,395 --> 01:25:21,396
along with his brother.

1523
01:25:21,397 --> 01:25:22,814
Nikolas Nikas was arrested
near the scene

1524
01:25:22,815 --> 01:25:24,733
after crashing through
a plate-glass window

1525
01:25:24,734 --> 01:25:26,234
at the New World Mall.

1526
01:25:26,235 --> 01:25:27,986
He's currently being held
at the Queens Detention Center

1527
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:28,613
awaiting a court appearance.

1528
01:25:29,613 --> 01:25:31,323
Today the brothers'
grandmother is speaking out...

1529
01:25:31,324 --> 01:25:33,950
So how much time are you facing?

1530
01:25:33,951 --> 01:25:36,997
She joins us now from Flushing
with the details.

1531
01:25:39,749 --> 01:25:40,999
Come on, man, look at me.

1532
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,584
...one exclusive,
Agapia Nikas...

1533
01:25:42,585 --> 01:25:45,253
I don't care.
I don't give a fuck.

1534
01:25:45,254 --> 01:25:48,798
I know your situation
can't be worse than mine.

1535
01:25:48,799 --> 01:25:49,966
Everybody goes through shit.

1536
01:25:49,967 --> 01:25:52,676
I'm the last one to judge.

1537
01:25:52,677 --> 01:25:55,096
She blames him for
an altercation with Nikolas

1538
01:25:55,097 --> 01:25:57,140
that left her with a broken arm.

1539
01:25:57,141 --> 01:25:59,146
You ever do time before?

1540
01:26:02,146 --> 01:26:03,480
Fucking kidding me?

1541
01:26:03,481 --> 01:26:05,023
Just asking you a question.

1542
01:26:06,984 --> 01:26:08,585
Why you gotta be such
a fuckin' little prick

1543
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:09,778
all the time, man?

1544
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:10,862
Look at you.
Look at you.

1545
01:26:10,863 --> 01:26:11,863
You're drunk as shit,

1546
01:26:11,864 --> 01:26:13,031
and now you wanna
get real with me?

1547
01:26:13,032 --> 01:26:14,491
Don't fucking
flatter yourself, bro.

1548
01:26:14,492 --> 01:26:15,700
Huh?

1549
01:26:15,701 --> 01:26:18,161
I'm not trying
to get real with you.

1550
01:26:18,162 --> 01:26:19,454
You know what?
I'm fucking real.

1551
01:26:19,455 --> 01:26:20,664
Fuck.

1552
01:26:20,665 --> 01:26:22,707
I'm trying to
talk to you, all right?

1553
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:24,292
Go fuck yourself, man.

1554
01:26:24,293 --> 01:26:25,602
You think you're better than me.

1555
01:26:25,627 --> 01:26:27,212
I am better than you.

1556
01:26:27,213 --> 01:26:29,547
You're an ignorant fuck, bro.

1557
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:31,967
No one's better than
any next man, all right?

1558
01:26:31,968 --> 01:26:33,218
You don't know me from Adam.

1559
01:26:33,219 --> 01:26:34,886
The second you got here,
you went to the booze

1560
01:26:34,887 --> 01:26:36,304
and you got fucked up.
But that's fine.

1561
01:26:36,305 --> 01:26:37,847
- So the fuck what?
- So that's who, that's who...

1562
01:26:37,848 --> 01:26:39,307
That's just who you are.
You're a fuckup.

1563
01:26:39,308 --> 01:26:41,393
That's it. I don't care.
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

1564
01:26:41,394 --> 01:26:43,311
You shouldn't give a shit.
Who gives a shit?

1565
01:26:43,312 --> 01:26:44,854
I... I definitely
don't give a shit.

1566
01:26:44,855 --> 01:26:46,022
Look. Losers like you
are incapable

1567
01:26:46,023 --> 01:26:47,524
of taking care of themselves.

1568
01:26:47,525 --> 01:26:50,068
You're either leeching off
mommy or leeching off welfare

1569
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:51,736
or living off
the government in jail.

1570
01:26:51,737 --> 01:26:53,029
That's you!

1571
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:54,990
You don't know the first thing
about me, bro.

1572
01:26:54,991 --> 01:26:56,574
What's to know?
What's to know?

1573
01:26:56,575 --> 01:26:58,535
You serve absolutely
no function whatsoever.

1574
01:26:58,536 --> 01:27:00,179
It's pathetic.

1575
01:27:00,204 --> 01:27:04,874
I probably made more money
in the last two years

1576
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,918
than you did in
your whole fucking life, man.

1577
01:27:06,919 --> 01:27:08,336
Let's see, man, a couple

1578
01:27:08,337 --> 01:27:10,255
of years from now,
you ever seen me driving by

1579
01:27:10,256 --> 01:27:11,756
in my fucking Lambo.

1580
01:27:11,757 --> 01:27:13,258
You're gonna put
your fuckin' foot

1581
01:27:13,259 --> 01:27:15,903
so far up your mouth, bro.

1582
01:27:15,928 --> 01:27:18,179
You don't know what I'm
talking about at all.

1583
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:22,775
'Bout fuckin' time.

1584
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:31,989
Hello.

1585
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:34,362
Hello.

1586
01:27:34,363 --> 01:27:36,716
Yo, it's Caliph. Buzz me up.

1587
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:38,283
All right.
I'm buzzing you up right now.

1588
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:47,125
Yo, come on. Get in, man.

1589
01:27:47,126 --> 01:27:48,793
What the fuck happened
to your face, nigga?

1590
01:27:48,794 --> 01:27:50,712
- I told you it was fucked up.
- You didn't tell me it was

1591
01:27:50,713 --> 01:27:52,130
- like this.
- It is. It is.

1592
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:53,798
Aw, I can't even fuckin'
look at you, man.

1593
01:27:53,799 --> 01:27:55,216
It's disgusting.

1594
01:27:55,217 --> 01:27:57,052
Then don't look at me.
I don't know what to tell you.

1595
01:27:57,053 --> 01:27:58,553
Where's the bottle?

1596
01:27:58,554 --> 01:27:59,929
It's in
this room with this fucker.

1597
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:01,431
What are you whispering about?

1598
01:28:01,432 --> 01:28:03,892
Listen. Listen. This guy's
fuckin' shot up, all right?

1599
01:28:03,893 --> 01:28:04,976
I just want to
get this shit over with.

1600
01:28:04,977 --> 01:28:07,527
Man, fuck this shit.

1601
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:10,148
- Yo, what's up?
- Shut the door!

1602
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:11,566
What the fuck! You didn't
tell me there was a fucking

1603
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:12,817
dog in there.

1604
01:28:12,818 --> 01:28:14,319
Fucking forgot about that,
man. That's my bad.

1605
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,737
What the fuck!

1606
01:28:15,738 --> 01:28:16,905
How much did you bring?

1607
01:28:16,906 --> 01:28:18,573
Calm the fuck down.

1608
01:28:18,574 --> 01:28:20,325
How much did you bring?

1609
01:28:20,326 --> 01:28:22,243
I thought we were gonna
talk about this shit first,

1610
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:23,453
and then decide.

1611
01:28:23,454 --> 01:28:24,913
So you brought nothing.

1612
01:28:24,914 --> 01:28:26,915
I need to know what the fuck
I'm payin' for.

1613
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:28,166
Is this guy serious?

1614
01:28:28,167 --> 01:28:29,501
Yeah, I'm very serious.

1615
01:28:29,502 --> 01:28:30,961
I could've run with
my own fucking car

1616
01:28:30,962 --> 01:28:32,587
and got the shit
the other day myself.

1617
01:28:32,588 --> 01:28:35,090
All right, both of you
get out. We're done.

1618
01:28:36,467 --> 01:28:37,968
Yo. Just give him
whatever you got,

1619
01:28:37,969 --> 01:28:39,678
and let's get the fuck
outta here.

1620
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,679
I'm gonna go get $1,000
from the ATM

1621
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,931
and bring it right back.

1622
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:45,600
I want 15,000, not 1,000.

1623
01:28:45,601 --> 01:28:47,435
How am I gonna get 15,000
from an ATM,

1624
01:28:47,436 --> 01:28:48,812
you crazy motherfucker?

1625
01:28:48,813 --> 01:28:50,480
This conversation's
over. You can leave now.

1626
01:28:50,481 --> 01:28:51,582
- Both of you.
- Don't give him shit.

1627
01:28:51,607 --> 01:28:52,857
How 'bout we do this?

1628
01:28:52,858 --> 01:28:54,859
I'll go to the ATM right now,

1629
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,821
and I'm gonna take out $1,000
times three.

1630
01:28:57,822 --> 01:28:59,030
- Three Gs for you...
- No.

1631
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:00,591
From the ATM in 30 minutes.

1632
01:29:00,616 --> 01:29:01,950
No. Not good enough!

1633
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:04,995
All right. I'm gonna go
to the motherfuckin' bank.

1634
01:29:04,996 --> 01:29:06,496
It's gonna take me
about three hours

1635
01:29:06,497 --> 01:29:08,456
to get you the 15 Gs.

1636
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,208
You want to sit here
and wait here like a dick?

1637
01:29:10,209 --> 01:29:12,294
Yeah.

1638
01:29:12,295 --> 01:29:14,339
Okay, great. Fine.

1639
01:29:15,339 --> 01:29:17,191
Great.

1640
01:29:17,216 --> 01:29:19,610
That guy's full of fuckin'
shit. He's an asshole.

1641
01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:20,969
You see what the fuck
I've been dealin' with

1642
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:23,388
- all fuckin' night?
- Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1643
01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:24,680
I'm gonna fuckin' go right now.

1644
01:29:24,681 --> 01:29:27,493
I'll be back at 9:30.

1645
01:29:27,518 --> 01:29:29,519
Keep your eye on him, all right?

1646
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,021
I'm gonna go to the BX.

1647
01:29:31,022 --> 01:29:32,688
I'm gonna get with Tasha.

1648
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:34,482
And then I'll be back.

1649
01:29:34,483 --> 01:29:35,525
That's what I'm talking about.

1650
01:29:35,526 --> 01:29:36,985
Hold him the fuck down.

1651
01:29:36,986 --> 01:29:39,873
Yeah. I'll see you, all right?

1652
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:50,336
Yo!

1653
01:29:54,503 --> 01:29:56,171
Yo!

1654
01:29:56,172 --> 01:29:57,776
What?

1655
01:30:00,426 --> 01:30:01,733
What are you doing?

1656
01:30:05,848 --> 01:30:07,057
I told you. I'm done.

1657
01:30:07,058 --> 01:30:08,683
He's coming back
with the money, bro.

1658
01:30:08,684 --> 01:30:09,934
Get off. I'm leaving.

1659
01:30:09,935 --> 01:30:11,728
No, we're waiting.
We're fucking waiting.

1660
01:30:11,729 --> 01:30:14,336
Waiting for what?

1661
01:30:16,275 --> 01:30:17,734
We're fuckin' waiting!

1662
01:30:17,735 --> 01:30:20,239
I'm not letting you leave
with that fuckin' bottle, man.

1663
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:24,115
Fuckin' let go of this shit.

1664
01:30:26,618 --> 01:30:28,702
Get off me! Fucking mutt!

1665
01:30:28,703 --> 01:30:30,205
Get the fuck off me!

1666
01:30:30,206 --> 01:30:32,457
Shit! God damn it! Fuck!

1667
01:30:37,421 --> 01:30:39,048
Shit.

1668
01:30:45,637 --> 01:30:48,306
Yo, it's me. Yo, you gotta get
back here right now.

1669
01:30:48,307 --> 01:30:49,432
You gotta get back here
right fucking now.

1670
01:30:49,433 --> 01:30:50,618
Dude, he left!
He left with it!

1671
01:30:50,643 --> 01:30:52,227
What were you fucking thinking?

1672
01:30:52,228 --> 01:30:55,063
The fuckin' dog, man!
Listen, you just gotta come.

1673
01:30:55,064 --> 01:30:56,648
They're swarming
the fuckin' building.

1674
01:30:56,649 --> 01:30:58,066
Hold on. Hold on.

1675
01:31:12,665 --> 01:31:14,249
Stop! Stop!

1676
01:31:20,464 --> 01:31:21,491
Stop!

1677
01:31:22,925 --> 01:31:24,511
Hey, yo!

1678
01:31:25,511 --> 01:31:27,097
Stop!

1679
01:31:28,097 --> 01:31:30,270
Stop! You're under arrest.

1680
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:36,104
Get the fuck down!

1681
01:31:36,105 --> 01:31:37,281
Oh, shit!

1682
01:31:45,281 --> 01:31:46,948
He's getting bagged
as we speak, man!

1683
01:31:46,949 --> 01:31:48,491
It's on top of a parking lot.
In a puddle.

1684
01:31:48,492 --> 01:31:49,784
The Sprite bottle.
You can't miss it.

1685
01:31:49,785 --> 01:31:51,870
It's right out front.
It's right out front.

1686
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:53,121
You can't miss it.

1687
01:31:53,122 --> 01:31:54,205
I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

1688
01:31:54,206 --> 01:31:56,410
You never talked to me. Bye.

1689
01:31:57,043 --> 01:31:58,293
Police Department!

1690
01:31:58,294 --> 01:31:59,964
Come out with your hands up!
Open the door.

1691
01:32:22,985 --> 01:32:24,824
Hey, keep an eye on this crowd.

1692
01:32:31,827 --> 01:32:32,994
They're starting to set up

1693
01:32:32,995 --> 01:32:34,333
a perimeter for this.

1694
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:39,501
He went
out the window! Window!

1695
01:32:39,502 --> 01:32:40,752
Look up!

1696
01:32:40,753 --> 01:32:42,007
All units!
He's on the building!

1697
01:32:48,552 --> 01:32:50,345
All units.
Call it in now!

1698
01:34:56,889 --> 01:34:58,515
There he is.

1699
01:34:58,516 --> 01:35:00,143
Good to see you, Nick.

1700
01:35:01,143 --> 01:35:03,064
I'm really glad you're here.

1701
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:06,094
And I gotta tell you,
that is a very cool haircut.

1702
01:35:06,113 --> 01:35:08,114
You look really sharp.

1703
01:35:08,115 --> 01:35:10,616
Mrs. Nikas, it's so good
to see you, too.

1704
01:35:10,617 --> 01:35:12,243
- Good to see you.
- Thank you for bringing.

1705
01:35:12,244 --> 01:35:13,369
- Nick in. Thank you.
- Thank you very much

1706
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,537
for everything.

1707
01:35:14,538 --> 01:35:16,205
Okay. Listen, I want you
to come with me.

1708
01:35:16,206 --> 01:35:17,540
I'm gonna take you someplace.

1709
01:35:17,541 --> 01:35:19,709
I just enrolled you in
this really terrific class.

1710
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:21,043
I'm gonna walk you
there right now.

1711
01:35:21,044 --> 01:35:23,208
You are gonna love it.

1712
01:35:25,716 --> 01:35:27,216
You know, Nick,
I have to tell you,

1713
01:35:27,217 --> 01:35:29,593
what Connie did.
Connie did the right thing.

1714
01:35:29,594 --> 01:35:32,221
He did
the really responsible thing.

1715
01:35:32,222 --> 01:35:33,889
And the best news is,

1716
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:35,390
he's right where he belongs.

1717
01:35:35,391 --> 01:35:37,143
And you're right
where you belong.

1718
01:35:37,144 --> 01:35:38,811
And I gotta tell you,
this place where we are now

1719
01:35:38,812 --> 01:35:41,397
can be a lot of fun
if you let it.

1720
01:35:41,398 --> 01:35:42,773
You know that, don't you?

1721
01:35:42,774 --> 01:35:46,110
Energy.
Energy in my hands.

1722
01:35:46,111 --> 01:35:48,403
Energy.
Energy in my foot.

1723
01:35:48,404 --> 01:35:52,616
- Hi, Peter!
- Hi. Hi, Samantha. Hi.

1724
01:35:52,617 --> 01:35:54,302
Please excuse me
for interrupting.

1725
01:35:54,327 --> 01:35:56,746
I just want everybody to
meet my friend Nick.

1726
01:35:56,747 --> 01:35:59,083
Nick, say hi to everybody.

1727
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:02,128
Hi, Nick!

1728
01:36:03,128 --> 01:36:04,670
That's Samantha.
This is Aubrey.

1729
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:05,921
- Hi.
- Aubrey conducts this class.

1730
01:36:05,922 --> 01:36:07,840
I've seen these classes.
They're great.

1731
01:36:07,841 --> 01:36:09,841
I think you're gonna like it.
It's a lot of fun.

1732
01:36:09,842 --> 01:36:10,242
I don't know nobody here though.

1733
01:36:10,247 --> 01:36:11,414
No, you don't.

1734
01:36:11,415 --> 01:36:12,498
That's okay.
There's a lot of people here

1735
01:36:12,499 --> 01:36:13,999
that are new, too.
You're not alone.

1736
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,168
You're gonna have a good time.
And I'll be right out here.

1737
01:36:16,169 --> 01:36:17,503
I'm just going to be
waiting for you.

1738
01:36:17,504 --> 01:36:18,671
- I'm not leaving without you.
- All right.

1739
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:20,381
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to see you.

1740
01:36:20,382 --> 01:36:21,507
Bye, Peter!

1741
01:36:21,508 --> 01:36:22,758
Bye, Samantha.

1742
01:36:22,759 --> 01:36:25,010
Nice to meet you.
Can I take your coat?

1743
01:36:26,429 --> 01:36:28,013
I've really had a long day.

1744
01:36:28,014 --> 01:36:29,765
Hey, guys, say hi to Nick
one more time.

1745
01:36:29,766 --> 01:36:32,184
- Make him feel welcome.
- Hi, Nick.

1746
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:34,019
Okay.
Since Nick is here,

1747
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,938
we're gonna get to know
each other a little bit more

1748
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:38,023
and play something
called Cross The Room.

1749
01:36:38,024 --> 01:36:40,067
So I'd love
everyone to divide up

1750
01:36:40,068 --> 01:36:41,193
on one side of the room.

1751
01:36:41,194 --> 01:36:42,695
Nick, this way, thank you.

1752
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:45,030
Uh, Rodney, you can actually
get over here.

1753
01:36:45,031 --> 01:36:46,699
Bachari next to Andrew.

1754
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,950
Perfect.

1755
01:36:47,951 --> 01:36:51,287
Okay. I'm going to give you
a prompt.

1756
01:36:51,288 --> 01:36:52,747
I'm gonna say,

1757
01:36:52,748 --> 01:36:55,624
"Cross the room if you
like something."

1758
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:58,252
"Cross the room
if you want to do something."

1759
01:36:58,253 --> 01:37:01,714
"Cross the room if you have
ever done something."

1760
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:04,383
And if you have or agree
with those prompts,

1761
01:37:04,384 --> 01:37:06,385
you would cross the room.

1762
01:37:06,386 --> 01:37:07,595
Now,

1763
01:37:07,596 --> 01:37:10,389
you choose whether or not
you want to cross.

1764
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:13,893
You don't have to.
It could be your secret.

1765
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,978
You choose your truth. Okay?

1766
01:37:15,979 --> 01:37:17,063
Okay.

1767
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:19,065
So let's start with
something easy.

1768
01:37:19,066 --> 01:37:23,903
Cross the room
if you like candy.

1769
01:37:27,574 --> 01:37:31,451
Mikey and Michael
don't like candy? Okay.

1770
01:37:31,452 --> 01:37:33,621
How about something harder?

1771
01:37:33,622 --> 01:37:36,918
Cross the room
if you've ever been in love.

1772
01:37:37,608 --> 01:37:40,431
- I think I have.
- You think you have?

1773
01:37:41,963 --> 01:37:43,255
Okay.

1774
01:37:43,256 --> 01:37:47,643
Cross the room
if you have ever lied.

1775
01:37:54,643 --> 01:37:56,310
Cross the room

1776
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:57,229
if you've ever not gotten along

1777
01:37:57,249 --> 01:37:58,999
with your family members
sometimes.

1778
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,670
There were family problems.

1779
01:38:01,671 --> 01:38:04,342
Family drama.
No family drama?

1780
01:38:06,342 --> 01:38:08,426
Does anybody have
another suggestion?

1781
01:38:08,427 --> 01:38:09,594
- I do.
- Sure.

1782
01:38:09,595 --> 01:38:11,012
- Oh, sorry, guys.
- Cross the room

1783
01:38:11,013 --> 01:38:13,181
if you've ever been blamed
for something

1784
01:38:13,182 --> 01:38:15,058
that you didn't do.

1785
01:38:15,059 --> 01:38:17,607
Oh, plenty of times.

1786
01:38:21,607 --> 01:38:25,276
Cross the room if you've ever
been to New Year's Eve,

1787
01:38:25,277 --> 01:38:27,204
Christmas at Rockefeller Center.

1788
01:38:35,204 --> 01:38:36,746
Travis?

1789
01:38:36,747 --> 01:38:40,542
Cross the room
if you've ever done

1790
01:38:40,543 --> 01:38:43,586
anything stupid
with your friends.

1791
01:38:43,587 --> 01:38:45,046
Cross the room
if you've ever done something

1792
01:38:45,047 --> 01:38:47,305
stupid with your friends.

1793
01:38:50,094 --> 01:38:51,553
Mikey, do you have a suggestion?

1794
01:38:51,554 --> 01:38:53,392
Yeah, cross the room

1795
01:38:56,392 --> 01:39:01,563
if you have not been
to Dream Street.

1796
01:39:01,564 --> 01:39:04,821
Cross the room if you
have not been to Dream Street.

1797
01:39:08,821 --> 01:39:11,239
- Samantha?
- Cross the room

1798
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:15,410
if you'd really love to mentor
special ed nursery school.

1799
01:39:15,411 --> 01:39:17,120
Cross the room
if you've ever mentored

1800
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:19,080
or want to mentor
special needs children.

1801
01:39:19,081 --> 01:39:20,085
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1802
01:39:23,085 --> 01:39:25,595
Cross the room
if you have a friend.

1803
01:39:32,595 --> 01:39:33,597
Megan?

1804
01:39:34,597 --> 01:39:37,687
Cross the room
if you've even been lonely.

1805
01:39:41,687 --> 01:39:43,938
Cross the room if

1806
01:39:43,939 --> 01:39:47,611
you like musicals.

1807
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:50,295
Do an easy one.

1808
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:09,381
Cross the room
if you've ever felt

1809
01:40:09,382 --> 01:40:11,953
like you spend
too much time at home.
