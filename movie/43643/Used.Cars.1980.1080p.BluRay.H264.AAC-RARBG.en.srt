I love ya!
Oh, Rudy! Rudy.

157
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,667
I'm on my way!
Listen to this.
[Coughing]

158
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,626
Ask not what your country's
done for you, ask what you've
just done for your country.

159
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,679
How we doin'?
Would you vote for that?
Rudy.

160
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,431
Are you okay? You, you...
Hey, are you all right, Luke?

161
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,765
I'm just not used to
all that kind of excitement.

162
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:54,272
Here, here.
Jesus, I'm sorry, Luke.
Here, take a pill. Here.

163
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,935
I'll be all right.
[Panting]

164
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,568
You just promise me one thing.

165
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:06,406
When you buy that election,
become a big-shot politician,

166
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:10,214
promise me you'll keep
my mercenary brother from
gettin' his hands on this lot.

167
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,130
They know, don't they, Sam?

168
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,169
Yeah, that's why they're
fixing up that pig farm.

169
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,844
They know they're about to have
the best freeway access in the state.

170
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,803
Nobody knows but you.
Won't be announced
for a few weeks yet.

171
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,096
Now, I suggest you put
a torch to this museum,

172
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,771
and use the insurance money
to buy out your brother.
[Roy] Buy him out?

173
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,603
If I could buy him out,
do you think I'd go to all the trouble
to try to have him put away?

174
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,148
Think I'd have sicced
the Consumer Protective Agency on him?

175
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,783
No, by God, the only way
I'm going to get that lot is to inherit it.

176
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,494
I thought he had a daughter.
She ain't been heard of
in ten, twelve years.

[Roy Chuckling]
Son of a bitch has got
a bad heart, you know.

178
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,919
Don't be stupid, Roy.
Just dreamin', Sam.

179
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,921
Just dreamin'.
Right.

180
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:02,764
[Woman Over P.A. System]
Mr. Fred Zill, please come
to the payment window.

181
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,057
Carmine!
Yeah?

182
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,231
Send in that mechanic,
that new kid from the demolition derby.

183
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:17,273
Who, Mickey?
Yeah, yeah, Mickey.

184
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,788
That's why they call it a Pinto.
Let's examine that suspension,
shall we?

185
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,376
Look at that undercoating.
Classy chassis, pal.

186
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,550
Huh? Thanks.

187
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,589
Shall we examine
the capacious interior
of this luxury automobile?

188
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,835
[Jeff]
Let's examine that
deep-pile carpeting, shall we?

189
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,805
[Man]
I got this guy right where
I want him. Stay out of this.

190
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,561
I'll get him to knock
another fifty bucks off.

191
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:59,226
I got the papers all drawn up
on that Chrysler Imperial.
No, the Chevy Nova.

192

Hey, listen,
I'll be right with ya.

Excuse me, old man.
You a salesman?

[Train Whistle Blowing]

196
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,391
That's a miracle.

197
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,603
Yeah! God in heaven,
that's a miracle.

198
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,476
Excuse me.
You a salesman here?

199
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:45,284
I'm not one for religion,
but Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
that is a miracle.

200
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,111
[Chuckling]
That was my daughter
who called me. Yeah.

201
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,238
Can you believe it?
My own daughter.

202
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,366
I just want to buy a car.

203
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:57,373
You know, she took off
about ten years ago.
Joined one of those communes.

204
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,837
I ain't seen nor heard from her.
Didn't know if she was livin' or dead.

205
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,209
All of a sudden out of the blue,
she calls after ten years.

206
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,259
Now that... that's a miracle.

207
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,304
I know how you feel,
old man.
Yeah.

208
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,966
I had a dog once. Ran away.
Only she got hit by a truck.

209
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,308
Listen, now what's the story
on this '57 Chev here?

210
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,654
2,400? Come on.
You gotta be jacking me.

211
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:27,152
Son, you're looking at one
of the finest automobiles on this lot.

212
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,856
You know, I rebuilt that engine
with my own two hands.

213
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,746
Does it run?
[Chuckling]
Does it run?

214
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,750
Like a dream.

215
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:45,302
Well, old man,
for 2,400 it better run
like a wet dream.

216
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,046
Yeah, that's a miracle.

217
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,730
[Engine Revs]
Well, at least it starts,
old man.

218

After ten years.
[Chuckles]

219
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,519
You won't need that.

220
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,067

226

It's running real hot.
Real hot.

227
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,230

those pills for, old man?

I love chicken. I love it.

You're a good sport, old man.
You play well. I like you.

What do you say we find out
what this baby's constructed of?

235
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,689
Get over there, old man.

Ahh, 2,400? I don't know.

getting you this deal.
You know that.

Fifty bucks never killed anybody.

244

You are not gonna find
another deal anywhere
like this in town.

245

We shook hands
on this, remember?
A deal's a deal.

- Fifty bucks never killed anybody.

I'll see what I can do.
But I'm tellin' ya,

when he sees these,
he's gonna have a stroke.

I don't know, man.

I think we're out of our minds.
You know what I'm sayin'?

I mean, it's murder.

But the cops are gonna say
it was a heart attack.

He's got no wife, no family,
no will, no nothin'.

290
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,940
That means his brother
over there inherits this lot,
and I say that's bullshit.

gonna let that son of a bitch...

00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,238
We've got to fight fire with fire.

625
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:46,290
You'll be fighting fire
with enhanced radiation weaponry.
You're over their heads.

626
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,544
Okay, you two guys are sure
you can pull this off, right?

627
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,797
Are we sure we can pull this off?

628
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,720
If I can build and install
a pacemaker in this man's chest,

629
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,681
I damn well can bounce
a microwave off a satellite.

630
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,473
Rudy, Jesus,
look at this thing, huh?

631
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,178
Look at this here.
Only 12.95 list.

632
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,979
- No kidding.
- Don't you guys have
some equipment to hook up?

633
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,154
Oh, shit! I gotta get
some rosin core solder.

634
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,613
Radio Shack closes
in half an hour.
Let's get on it.

635
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,316
How do you change
the batteries in that?
It's rechargeable.

636
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,485
Hey, guys! The back door.
It's still light outside.

637
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,485
Good night, Eddie.
See you tomorrow night.

638
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,368
Yeah. Remember,
we cut in exactly at 9:03.
Got it.

639
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,577
Post meridiem.
What?

640
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,576
Oh, never mind.

641
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,378
Okay, Freddie, 9:03.

642
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,474
What are you guys doin'?
Will you get down, Rudy?
Get down.

643
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:46,347
What?
See that woman out there?

644
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,774
[Rudy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

645
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,363
[Jeff]
She's trouble. She pulled up
in that red Toyota.

646
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,030
Jeff, give me a break.
No, no, no.
I'm not kidding.

647
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,359
I think she's from
the Consumer Protection Agency.

648
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,195
See the way she's looking
at that blue Chevy?
She knows it's a taxi.

649
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,242
You're paranoid.
She's got great legs.

650
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:06,696
Great legs, but I bet you
the first thing she asks is
where's the owner.

651
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,038
Jeff, that is
a great-looking girl.

652
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:13,125
Girls who look
that great don't work for
the Consumer Protection Agency.

653
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,961
Okay, but just don't let the little head
do the thinking for the big head.

654
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,380
Trust me.
Huh? I do.

655
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,758
Congratulations!
Yeah, you!
This is our giveaway week.

656
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,307
Since you're
our 100th customer, you win,
whether I sell you a car or not.

657
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:32,313
You just won a candlelight dinner for two
at the restaurant of your choice.

658
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:35,187
But, I can see
there's only one of you.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

659
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:39,154
I think I'll throw
myself in with the deal.
How's that sound?

660
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:47,655
Listen, can you tell me
where I might find the owner?

661
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,000
Um...

662
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,462
Well, uh...

663
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:57,593
Uh, yeah.
Oh, great.

664
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,592
I could, but first,
let... let me tell you
about this car, right?

665
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,756
I can give you
a terrific price on this car,
unbelievably low price.

666
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,757
On this car?
Yeah.

667
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,269
I would certainly hope so.
I mean, look at the finish.
Is something wrong?

668
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,811
Well, yeah,
I mean, I see primer.

669
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:16,397
Primer? Where?
Where?
Well, I see yellow primer here.

670
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,942
I see it here. I see it here.
Oh, I don't know.

671
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:25,617
She's baiting him.
She knows it's a taxi, Rudy.

672
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,240
She's from the Consumer
Protection Agency.

673
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,410
No, I'm not with
any Consumer Protection Agency.
I used to be, but I'm not...

674
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,460
Environmental Protection
Agency?
No.

675
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,634
Better Business Bureau?
Nader's Raiders?
No.

676
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,171
Trust me.

677
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,762
As in "trust me"?
Yeah.

678
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:48,636
So look, about dinner...
Listen, is Luke
in his office?

679
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,773
No, he's not here.
What do you feel
like eating?

680
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:53,772
Do you expect him
back shortly?
He's out of town.

681
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:57,055
But I'll tell you what.
The best steaks...
He's out of town on business...

682
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,690
Pleasure.
He's in Miami Beach.
Miami?

683
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,648
Miami Beach.
Miami Beach?

684
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:07,068
It's nothing to get upset about.
I've been to Miami Beach.
It's not that bad.

685
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,118
You see, I was supposed
to meet my father here.

686
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:13,713
Father? We'll find him.
There's no problem.
What kind of car does he drive?

687
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,289
I don't know. He used to have
a green and white Edsel.

688
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,835
Green and white... Edsel?
Ow! God!

689
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,340
Who do you think
this is, huh?
That's her.

690
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,724
[Toilet Flushes]

691
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,681
No resemblance.
No resemblance.

692
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:32,313
I've been selling cars
long enough to know when
somebody's telling me the truth.

693
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,771
That is Luke's daughter.
We have any health food
restaurants in this town?

694
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,734
Listen, pally.
If that's Luke's daughter,
we gotta get rid of her.

695
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,566
What if she figures out what's
going on here? What if she
sees our commercial tomorrow?

696
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,235
I know!
Why don't we throw her
in the hole with her old man?

697
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:51,373
We go out to dinner.
I'll get her drunk,
all right?

698
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,582
I'll tell her the reason
that Luke went to Florida
was because...

699
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:58,834
Good. The best salad bar
in town: Airport Lanes.

700
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,630
[Laughing]
Oh, stop it.
Then he says,

701
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,375
What?
"Don't ask me.
I'm just a farmer."

702
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,519
That is the most disgusting joke
I have ever heard.

703
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,106
Listen, Rudolph, I wanted
to ask you something.
What?

704
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:26,151
How did you know that I used to be
with the Consumer Protection Agency?

705
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:30,199
The thing with the painted taxicab.
I don't know why you didn't tell me
it was yellow primer.

706
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:34,293
Because you beat me to it.
I knew you were baiting me,
so I told you the truth.

707
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,410
The truth was actually
a bigger bunch of bullshit.

708
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:41,587
At least you're very honest
about your dishonesty.
And I admire that.

709
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,419
I really do.

710
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,929
Uh...

711
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,846
Look, Barbara, about Luke.
There's something I gotta tell you. It's...

712
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,392
Please. Luke left for Florida
the night I called.

713
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,398
You got it all wrong.
It's not the reason he left.

714
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,070
It would be better for me
and everybody concerned...

715
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:08,151
if I just get up
tomorrow morning and leave.

716
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:12,947
I was thinking maybe
headin' up to Oregon
or something like that.

717
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,334
Well...

718
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:18,831
Thank you very much
for taking me out,
taking care of me.

719
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:23,634
It was really considerate,
and I... really had a good time.

720
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,551
Uh, maybe we'll do it
again sometime.
I don't know.

721
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:32,893
Thanks a lot.
Good-bye. Thanks.

722
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,475
What am I doin'?

723
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,139
Barbara!
Barbara, wait a minute.

724
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,688
Ah, hey, look,

725
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:50,145
I know that sometimes
I can come off as, uh,

726
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,317
kind of... insincere.

727
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:58,617
But I just... I want you to know
that I really like you.

728
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:03,631
I haven't had this much fun
with a girl ever in my life.

729
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:09,589
So, once you and Luke
get your problems worked out,

730
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,934
come by, look me up.

731
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,534
Rudy?

732
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,276
I've been thinking about
what you've been saying
about Luke and everything.

733
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,999
And it's true,
I'm passing judgment on a man
I haven't even seen in ten years.

734
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:46,922
So, the least I can do is
give him the benefit of the doubt.

735
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,672
So I decided to stick around
for a few days.

736
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,836
So, uh, see you tomorrow, okay?
Good night.

737
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,926
She's stayin'?

738
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,308
Yeah, she's stayin'.

739
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,016
I told her Luke would call.
What else could I do?

740
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,187
What the fuck is that?
If she sees our commercial
on TV tonight,

741
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,237
she's gonna be suspicious
as a motherfucker.

742
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,240
And even if she don't,
we're gonna have a billion people
on that lot tomorrow.

743
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:19,905
How we gonna explain that?
I've been up all night
trying to figure this out.

744
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:24,754
It's like I told Jeff.
There's only one thing we can do.
Cancel the commercial.

745
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,832
Guys, guys, I got
the solution to our problem.

746
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,588
Listen to this.
Courtesy of
the beautiful Daphne.

747
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,591
What I have here
is a one-way train ticket
to Miami.

748
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,675
What you do,
is you take it out there,
you give it to Barbara.

749
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:41,431
Tell her... I don't know.
Tell her Luke called,
wants her to come down.

750
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:45,015
The train doesn't leave until midnight,
so Jim and I will do the commercial.

751
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,772
All you gotta do is keep her
away from a television set,
get her on the train.

752
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:51,185
Jeff, Jeff,
I feel horseshit enough as it is.

753
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,775
I took her to a bowling alley,
for Chrissake.

754
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,781
Look, I just...
I can't do this to her.

755
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,493
What would a senator do?

756
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,310
Don't you like
your salad?

757
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,520
Hello.

758
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,065
What is wrong with you? Where are you?
You're certainly not here.

759
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,320
Uh, I was just thinking...

760
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:42,164
about how much easier
everything would've been
if you'd have come last week.

761
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,252
I don't understand.
Why?

762
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,579
Okay.

763
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,875
All right. Okay.

764
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:55,511
Barbara, there's something
I gotta tell you.

765
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,719
I don't know if this is
the right time, but...

766
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:02,601
the truth of this whole thing
is that Luke...

767
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,020
Sir, I believe
you dropped this.

768
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,020
Uh, thanks.

769
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,312
Oh, wait a minute.

770
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,106
Rudy, this is a ticket
to Miami.

771
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,900
I was gonna wait
till after dessert, but...

772
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:19,855
- You talked to Luke last night?
- Uh, well, no.

773
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:24,447
I tried to get ahold of him,
but he's still on that fishing charter.

774
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,535
I just decided
to take it on myself.

775
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,710
That's the most considerate thing.

776
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,881
But I can't go.

777
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,420
What?

778
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,554
I don't wanna force myself

01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,724
That's a lot of crap, Russo.
You buried my brother here
and you know it.

944
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,841
What? Buried your brother?
Roy, are you looking for Luke?

945
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,929
'Cause I could've saved you
a whole lot of trouble.

946
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,644
He was here 30 minutes ago.
He went to get some breakfast.
He'll be right back.

947
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,688
You spoke to Lucas Fuchs
30 minutes ago?
Yes!

948
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,610
He got back from
Miami Beach last night.
He's got a tan and everything.

949
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,780
- [Door Closes]
- [Barking]

950
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,088
Oooh, shit, he smells!

951
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,415
Come on, Luke.
[Engine Revs]

952
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:35,547
[Jim]
I'm sorry, Luke.

953
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,255
Whoo!

954
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:42,096
- [Barking]
- Shut up, Toby! I hear ya!

955
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,858
Adios, Luke!

956
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:58,163
You're wasting your time.
He'll be right...
Here he comes now.

957
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:05,575
- [Man #1]
Jesus, it's him.
- [Man #2] He is still alive.

958
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,325
- Where the hell's he goin'?
- [Man] He's exceeding the speed limit.

959
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,958
[Man]
He's gotta be drunk.

960
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,848
- Where the hell's he goin'?
- He's heading right for that power transformer.

961
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,190
[Man]
Call the fire department.

962
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,152
[Siren Wailing]

963
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,871
All right, let's go!
Grab that pump.

964
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,450
Very neat, Russo.

965
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,496
Very clean.

966
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:50,630
Plenty of witnesses,
everything up in flames,
not a trace of evidence.

967
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,380
Shrewd.
Kept yourself out of jail.

968
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:57,094
[Chuckles]
Now get the fuck off my lot.

969
01:08:57,217 --> 01:09:00,547
Your lot?
You just gave it to me.

970
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,547
Handed it to me
on a silver platter.

971
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,269
Afraid not, Roy L.
You see, Luke's got a daughter.

972
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,891
You remember your niece, Barbara.
She's back in town.

973
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,978
I bet you haven't seen her
in what, over ten years.
Wanna talk to her?

974
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:16,526
She's, uh,
staying over at my place.

975
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,865
You son of a bitch!

976
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:25,161
Holy Jesus!

977
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,156
Goddamn!
Get off me!
Get this maniac off me.

978
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,329
Get off him, you maniac!
Get him off!

979
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,836
Okay, mac, come on.
Come on, you.

980
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,050
Oh, my God.

981
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,590
Get your hands off me!
I'm Roy L. Fuchs!

982
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,506
You son of a bitch!
[Man]
Easy, Roy, easy.

983
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,715
Barbara!
Uh, I was just
gonna call you.

984
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,887
There's been
a terrible accident.
Your father's dead.

985
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:51,136
Why don't you tell her
the truth?
He was already dead.

986
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,691
He buried him back there
in the Edsel.
Don't listen to him.

987
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:58,323
Rudy, please tell me
the truth.

988
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:01,533
All right. Okay.

989
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:06,164
Your father,
he wasn't in Miami.
Never was.

990
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:10,294
He was... in... Aspen.

991
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,923
He didn't want you
to be here when he got back,
so he told me...

992
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,713
Rudy, you're fired.
And take your friends with you.
Wait a minute.

993
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:19,876
Get off my lot!
They're trying
to take over this lot.

994
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,968
[Sobbing]

995
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,643
Shit.

996
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,605
So, what do you say?

997
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:40,398
I'll have
to think about it.

998
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,696
He's an asshole.

999
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,740
Don't think about it too long.
There was a ninth grader
looking at it yesterday.

1000
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,290
Real grinders, you know it?
Tougher to close
than their parents.

1001
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,415
Ah, Christ!
How am I gonna come up
with five grand?

1002
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,593
[Sighs]

1003
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,090
I'll tell you what.

1004
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:07,926
Why don't you call my bookie,
put some money on
the game tonight, huh?

1005
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,894
I got a good feeling about Denver.
Here's his number.

1006
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:16,098
Denver? Shit,
Denver's ranked tenth!
That's right.

1007
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:21,149
But get this. I was in
a pay phone booth this morning.
I found a dime. Ten cents.

1008
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:25,815
Minted in Denver.
The numbers that I dialed
added up to ten.

1009
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,987
Today is the tenth.
You know what?

1010
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,236
You know what time it was
when I found the dime?

1011
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,750
10:00.
No, ten after 10:00.
[Chuckles]

1012
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,671
I can't lose.
So I bet ten bucks.

1013
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:39,461
That's the dumbest fucking shit
I ever heard in my life, Jeff.

1014
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:44,215
Goddamn superstitious crap!
I'm gonna push you under
a ladder on Friday the 13th.

1015
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,774
Look, why don't
you just go ahead
and call her, huh?

1016
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:56,270
She knows you belong on that lot.
It won't hurt anything. Just call her.

1017
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,028
Okay, okay, okay.

1018
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:10,655
[Phone Ringing]

1019
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,623
Yeah?
[Man]
Mr. Russo?

1020
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,655
Yeah.
This is Mr. Caldwell speaking.
The party chairman.

1021
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,828
Our timetable got pushed up
and the machine has to present...

1022
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,587
its slate of candidates
for the nomination
the day after tomorrow.

1023
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,170
That means we'll need
your contribution
tomorrow morning.

1024
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:27,007
You do have it, don't you?
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, I got it.

1025
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,303
Very good. I'll send Mr. Tucker
to pick it up in the morning.

1026
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,469
Hey, hey, hey!
Good to have you aboard.

1027
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:35,557
Great.
Put it out!
Put it out!

1028
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,856
Here's the script, Boss.

1029
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:53,120
You're sure this is the one
they're filming now?
I swiped it right off the truck.

1030
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,622
Well, this stinks.
[Laughs]

1031
01:12:56,706 --> 01:13:01,166
I wouldn't buy a car
from anybody who'd put
this kind of shit on TV.

1032
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,962
Would you buy a car
from anybody who'd put
this kind of shit on TV?

1033
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,468
I wouldn't.
That's what I keep telling you.
She don't know what she's doing.

1034
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,681
She ain't sold a single car
in four days.

1035
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,602
At this rate,
she'll be bankrupt
in three weeks.

1036
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,141
Yeah.

1037
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,726
[Ringing]
Yeah?

1038
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,151
Roy? Sam.
Any progress
with your niece?

1039
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,940
Ah, no. She's as stubborn
as her old man.
She won't sell dick.

1040
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:29,566
But I'll just bide my time.
She'll be bankrupt in two weeks.

1041
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,155
Roy, you haven't any time to bide.
The mayor's running scared.

1042
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,542
He's gonna announce
the new freeway
the day after tomorrow.

1043
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:40,421
You better forget about
buying your niece's lot
and find some sucker to buy yours.

1044
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,000
Roy? Roy?

1045
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:46,764
Asshole mayor!

1046
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:51,014
We know anybody
over at channel seven?

1047
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,096
Now watch this.

1048
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:08,819
See the, uh, style of cars
we have to choose from.
We have...

1049
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,992
See where she said
"style"?

1050
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,829
See the, uh,

1051
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:19,000
style of cars
we have to choose from...

1052
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,040
Now further on down
she says this.

1053
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:26,341
3217 Valley Road,

1054
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:31,550
just one, uh,
mile west of route...

1055
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,684
A mile.
I took the word mile
and I put it over style.

1056
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,013
Now watch this.

1057
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:42,979
Come on down and see
the, uh, mile of cars...

1058
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:45,612
we have to choose from.

1059
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,900
Son of a bitch!

1060
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,824
[Laughing]
Let me see that again.

1061
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,117
See the,

1062
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,200
uh, mile of cars
we have to choose from.

1063
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,788
We have...
Goddamn,
that's terrific!

1064
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,785
What do you think, Sam?
Most blatant case of
false advertising I've ever seen.

1065
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:10,378
I could have her convicted
24 hours after it's aired.

1066
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:14,006
When are they
gonna show that?
During tonight's game.

1067
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,603
Why don't you
come on down and...

1068
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:20,929
see the, uh, mile of cars
we have to choose from?

1069
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,847
What did she say?
She said she had a mile of cars.

1070
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,186
[Rudy]
Can you believe that?

1071
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:31,994
That's the most blatant claim
of false advertising I ever heard.
She doesn't even know.

1072
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,911
[Rudy] Jesus.
Most of them need, uh,
a paint job or bodywork.

1073
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,030
She sure looks good, though,
doesn't she?

1074
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:43,498
[Barbara]
But all of them have been
safety checked.

1075
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,713
Russo.
Uh, yeah, yeah.

1076
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,711
Russo, I've been looking
all over for you.

1077
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:52,714
You son of a bee!
I'm about to lose my job
because of you.

1078
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,508
I've got more than
250 sophomores...

1079
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:58,263
who aren't going to pass
driver education...

1080
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:01,466
because your friggin' cars
won't run!

1081
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:06,059
You guys got an auto shop class.
Enroll your 250 sophomores in it
and teach 'em something.

1082
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,185
I'll teach you something.

1083
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:12,151
[Man On TV]
Okay, we're back.

1084
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,645
I'm gonna take your...
Ohh!

1085
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,736
[Man On TV]
He's looking.

1086
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,794
Off to his left to find him.
He's sacked!

1087
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:24,249
It's that Arnold DeBiers.
He's been on him all day.

1088
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:29,920
And that's the fifth sack
of Kusamano this afternoon.

1089
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:33,712
What did I tell ya, Rudy?
Denver.

1090
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,758
Hey, look,
when I get a feeling,
I get a feeling, huh?

1091
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,602
Hell of a game.
Should have put
some money on it.

1092
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,060
I did.
You did? Great.

1093
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,430
Kansas City.

1094
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:53,111
Kansas City?
Well, how much
did you put down?

1095
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:58,029
All of it.
All of it.

1096
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:01,954
[Laughing]
Everything I own.

1097
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,080
Forty G's?

1098
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,456
You dope!
You just threw it away.

1099
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:14,344
You just threw it
right down the tubes.

1100
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:17,802
Don't you get it?
The only way you can win
is if, uh,

1101
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,053
uh, if I lose.

1102
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,557
Start that clock once again.
We have a minute
and 28 seconds.

1103
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,600
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about it, Jeff.
I think your money's in the bag.

1104
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:33,896
A minute to go. Denver would
have to run into some pretty
bad luck, don't you think?

1105
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:36,823
[Man On TV] Denver would
have to run into some pretty
bad luck, don't you think?

1106
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,992
Pete Green, of course,
one of the finer punters...

1107
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,912
in professional football today.

1108
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:47,252
Okay, here's Denver with
ten men up there on the line.

1109
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,750
Here's the kick.

1110
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,554
Signals for a fair catch,
and he fumbles the ball.

1111
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,011
He fumbles the ball,
and it's recovered by...

1112
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,092
I got the ball.
I got the ball.

1113
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,969
I got the ball.
I got it.
See?

1114
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:10,063
Hold this stuff.
I gotta turn this contest around.
I got a chance.

1115
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:13,444
I got the ball, Jim.
I got a chance.

1116
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,232
More salt, more salt.

1117
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:19,737
Talk about your bad-luck days.
He seemed to have it in his grasp.

1118
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,910
No one seemed to hit him,
and yet the ball squirted loose.

1119
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:26,910
Just like magic,
it flew out of his hands.

1120
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:29,704
Excuse me.
Let me have that salt.

1121
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:31,919
Give me...
[Grunts]

1122
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:34,079
Pass the ball.

1123
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:37,708
[Man On TV]
Regardless of what brings
the change of luck around...

1124
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:40,467
Is there a black cat
in the house?
How about a ladder?

1125
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,799
[Man On TV]
He's got Webster
split wide to the right.

1126
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,755
Ladder!
[Grunts]

1127
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,215
Hey! What the hell
are you trying to do?

1128
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,636
[Man On TV]
Here's the snap.

1129
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:54,145
Kusamano drops back.
He's got Webster streaking.

1130
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,110
[Man On TV]
He throws to the end zone!

1131
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,900
And it's... Oooh!
Out of bounds.

1132
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:04,735
Okay, Kusamano back
to the drawing board.

1133
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:07,414
Gotta be a pass play now.

1134
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,703
[Man On TV]
Wait, here's a pitch to Smith.

1135
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:13,827
Wait a minute, Smith
flips it back to Kusamano
on the old flea-flicker.

1136
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,416
- He's got some blocks in front of him.
- Duck!

1137
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,757
[Shouting]

1138
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,090
He could go all the way!

1139
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:26,505
Touchdown!
I don't believe it!

1140
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,635
[Man On TV]
I don't believe it.

1141
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:32,273
I won.

1142
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,151
He made it!
Touchdown!

1143
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,020
I made it!
I made it!

1144
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,215
[Horn Honking]

1145
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:22,864
You got the money, Russo?
Or should I say, Senator Russo?

1146
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:34,248
Now, Mr. Tucker, I gotta tell you,
I'm a little bit nervous about, uh,

1147
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,210
well, about what
I'm supposed to do.

1148
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:39,710
Like what sort of policies
are you guys trying to push?

1149
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:43,295
The party shares the concerns
of the middle American taxpayer,
the workingman.

1150
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,510
And we're also in favor
of civic improvements.

1151
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:48,841
Here's the new freeway
we're announcing tomorrow.
My son-in-law got that contract.

1152
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:54,018
Lester Beaumont.
Beaumont Cement Corporation.
Fine boy. Yes, sir.

1153
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:57,939
We also are in favor
of public facilities.
Take a look at this here.

1154
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:03,022
We gonna tear down that
dilapidated hospital on the east side
and put in a golf course.

1155
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,978
Chairman Caldwell
really likes to play golf.

1156
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:08,069
He's a fine golfer. Practically wins
every tournament he plays in.

1157
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,905
Plays to a 48 handicap.
A really fine golfer.

1158
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,911
And we're in favor
of lowering taxes.

1159
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,294
Didn't you used to work there?

1160
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:19,752
[Rudy] Closed?
[Tucker]
Closed by court order.

1161
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,093
Another way the party's
looking out for the consumer.

1162
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,709
You know, last night,
the proprietor of that car lot...

1163
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,717
made a false and misleading claim
on a television commercial.

1164
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,220
One of our constituents
brought it to our attention.

1165
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:33,142
And the case goes before a judge
in about five minutes.

1166
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,522
And you know justice
can be swift when it has to.

1167
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:39,691
Goddamn, Sam,
what the hell do you mean
you got Hanging Judge Harrison?

1168
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,850
He's not on the take!
He's legit!

1169
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:45,609
Roy, remember
that colored kid found guilty
for stealing a case of beer?

1170
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,364
Billy Joe?
Billy Joe Washington?
Yeah.

1171
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,994
Well, Hanging Judge Harrison
gave him 35 years hard labor.

1172
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,583
Look, you need someone
who's gonna throw the book
at this broad.

1173
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:56,079
I paid off all the witnesses,
all the experts.

1174
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:58,751
I even have her attorney
on my payroll.

1175
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,751
[Snoring]

1176
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,503
I can win this case, Roy.
Trust me.

1177
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,086
Yeah, but
she's a first offender.

1178
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,091
That's a $500 fine
even if they do convict her.

1179
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:11,434
There's no way about it.
She's gonna be convicted.

1180
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,850
I'm afraid the fine's
gonna be real severe.

1181
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:16,931
Jesus.

1182
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:19,636
There's only one thing
she can do, is sell that lot.

1183
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:22,767
Jesus Christ.

1184
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,566
Wait a minute, Russo!

1185
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:32,278
Hey, hold it, hold it!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1186
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:35,494
[Shouting]

1187
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:40,826
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
The Honorable H.H. Harrison presiding.

1188
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:43,044
All rise.

1189
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,409
This court...

1190
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,414
is now in session.

1191
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:25,165
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth...

1192
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:28,092
so help you God?
[Door Closes]

1193
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,428
I do.

1194
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:51,031
Excuse me, can I...
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Sorry.

1195
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,570
Mr. Slaton,

1196
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,859
will you commence
the questioning?

1197
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,793
Please state your name
and occupation.

1198
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,369
Uh, Barbara Jane Fuchs.

1199
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,626
And I'm the owner
of the New Deal Car Lot.

1200
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:11,550
Miss Fuchs,
we have heard testimony...

1201
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:15,220
from four qualified experts
right here in this courtroom...

1202
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,800
- to the fact that the videotape
commercial in question...
- [Whispering] Lie.

1203
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,387
was authorized by you...

1204
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:25,233
and was not tampered with
in any way.

1205
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,520
Now, I put it to you, Miss Fuchs.

1206
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,734
Do you or do you not have
a mile of cars to sell on your lot?

1207
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,489
[Whispering]
Yes. Lie.

1208
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:41,491
Uh, could you
repeat the question, please?

1209
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:48,035
Do you have a mile of cars
for sale on your lot?

1210
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:52,957
- When placed end to end,
would all the cars total one mile?
- [Whispering] Yes.

1211
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,006
And may I remind you,
you are under oath.

1212
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,014
[Whispering]
I don't know.
Speak up, Miss Fuchs.

1213
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:07,272
- [Whispering] Yes.
- [Mouthing Words] Yes?

1214
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,320
- Yes.
- [Gallery Murmuring]

1216
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,031
Order! Order.

1217
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,697
Order! Order!

1218
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,844
[Judge Harrison]
Miss Fuchs?
Huh?

1219
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:39,967
Are you absolutely certain
that you understood...

1220
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:43,852
the gentleman's... question?

1221
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:50,648
Do you realize, Miss Fuchs,

1222
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:54,649
that one mile of cars
is over 250 cars?

1223
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:58,153
Are you aware that
you've opened yourself up
to a charge of perjury?

1224
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,197
Well... What?

1225
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,200
Your Honor,
if it please the court,

1226
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:05,992
I can produce a number of witnesses
who will testify that she is lying!

1227
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:09,998
That she has, in fact,
only 25 cars on her lot
at this time.

1228
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:13,842
- Why don't you see for yourself, Judge?
- [Gallery Murmuring Agreement]

1229
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:16,709
Order! Order!

1230
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:20,377
- [Gavel Banging]
- I have no objection to that, Your Honor.

1231
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,797
Neither do I.

1232
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:27,056
Miss Fuchs, I'm gonna release you
on your own recognizance.

at 2:45 p.m...

at the New Deal Used Car Lot...

1235
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:39,691
where I am gonna settle
this matter once and for all.

1236
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:54,995
250 keys, 250 titles, 250 cars.

1237
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,921
But, Rudy, you've brought
no transport trucks.

1238
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:05,218
How are you
gonna get them home?
I have 250 drivers.

1240
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,565
What have I done
to the children?

01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:27,235
Rudy, you want the one
with the water-based paint too?

All of them, Manuel.
Everything you've got.

1244
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:32,913
Rudy, how about
some marijuana? Rifles?
Later.

1245
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:37,130
Pass these out.
Anything that doesn't start, we'll tow.
Take him up on the reefers.

Oh, my God!

Russo, this better work.
That's all I can say.

1248
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:48,513
You told me your students
needed some road experience
to pass driver's ed, right?

1249
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,019
Yes.
They're gonna get
a crash course. Come on.

Hey, you, amigo!

1251
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,940
You! How about some rifles
for your students?

1252

Chino, bring some rifles.

1253
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:05,280
How about some rifles?
Take your hands off me, sir.
I don't believe in violence.

Forget about the rifles.

01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:15,287
Good. I'll win
the damn thing on default.

1257
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:17,084
Calls for a toast.

1258
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:21,837
To the man who in approximately
two hours will be the biggest
car dealer in the Southwest.

1259
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:25,172
Me, Roy L. Fuchs.

1260
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:27,298
Straighten that up.

1261
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:30,546
Drivers,
to your cars.

1262
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,719
[Shouting]

1263
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:43,685
Jeff, do you read me?
I copy you, Radio Two.

1264
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:48,357
I just finished measuring these,
and if we throw in 26 cars
we got on the lot and this truck,

1265
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:51,908
that gives us
18 feet safety margin,
that's one car.

1266
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:54,204
One mile and one car.
That's playing it
pretty close.

1267
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,499
Are we gonna make it
in two hours?
We have to.

1268
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,013
You girls are ready for
some heavy duty driving.

1269
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:09,839
Let's see.
Left hand at 10:00,
and right hand at 2:00.

1270
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,388
Jeff, do you read?

1271
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,850
Yeah, Rudy.
You got your backdoor man here.
I copy you clean.

1272
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:19,846
I'll be bringing up
your rear. Over.

1273
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:22,268
Would you watch where
the hell you're standing!

1274
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,527
This is my car.
Youse gotta go find yourself
another car, nigger.

1275
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,740
This is the only Cadillac,
and I don't drive in nothin'
but a Cadillac.

1276
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,742
Move over, buddy.
Ride bitch.

1277
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:33,946
We're towing a car!
Oh, no!

1278
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:36,867
Have you ever towed
a car before? Oh, great!
No.

1279
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:40,785
Drivers,
start your engines.

1280
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:53,143
Oh, my God.

1281
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,561
I'm going to have to take
one hand off the wheel
to start the car.

1282
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:59,313
You're not gonna flunk me
for that, are you?
Just start...

1283
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,056
Are you, Mr. Ghertner?
Nona, just start the car.

1284
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:04,397
[Chuckling]

1285
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,653
You ready?

1286
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,195
Let's go.

1287
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:12,741
Let's move 'em out!
[Whistles]
[Horns Honking]

1288
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,284
[Shouting]

1289
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:27,167
[Cheering]

1290
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:52,128
Come on, baby. Let's go!

1291
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:56,837
Rudy, how fast
are we going?
Fifty-five.

1292
01:31:56,928 --> 01:32:00,218
Oh, at this rate,
I think we're gonna be
about a half an hour late.

1293
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:02,727
I know it. All right,
everybody listen up.

1294
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:05,559
We're gonna have a lesson
in driving history.

1295
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:10,855
This is how we used to drive
on the highways...
at 75 miles an hour.

1296
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:14,202
Everybody,
75 miles an hour.

1297
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:17,069
- Seventy-five?
- Whoo!

1298
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,123
Damn!

1299
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:37,967
Put that pedal
on the floor!

1300
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:45,814
I've got this motherfucker wide open.
We're goin' now!

1301
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,573
This dude ain't
no driving teacher.
He's some kind of con man.

1302
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:56,954
He's gonna kill
our black ass.
Sure is.

1303
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:59,820
That's 20 miles
over the speed limit!

1304
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:03,368
And at $10 a mile,
that's a $200 fine!

1305
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:06,503
They can't fine us.
We don't have
our license yet.

1306
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:15,511
[Siren Wailing]
It's the police!
Stop!

1307
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:24,354
Oh, shit!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

1308
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:29,267
"At the scene of an accident,
always wait for the police to arrive."

1309
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:33,072
- This is 11-44.
- They're here.

1310
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,781
[Tires Screeching]
[Police]
You ain't gonna believe it.

1311
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:40,571
Rudy, we just lost
our one-car safety margin, pal.

1312
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:44,869
Jeff, you better take the point
and scout ahead for more cops.
We can't take any more chances.

1313
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:47,663
Okay, ten-four.

1314
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:10,522
[Fuchs]
How much you owe me now,
Carmine?

1315
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,645
Twenty-seven.
[Laughing]

1316
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:18,653
[Laughing]
Look at that!

1317
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:22,867
Boss? Boss,
I just heard some crazy shit
on my police scanner.

1318
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:27,371
There's a shitload of used cars
headed this way. You care?
Shit!

1319
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,094
Shit.

1320
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,272
Ah, Rudy, I hope you
read me, man,

1321
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:53,692
'cause we got
a real big problem here.

1322
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:57,072
What is it?
[Jeff]
A police roadblock.

1323
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,980
[Rudy]
Jeff, you better
go on ahead.

1324
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:02,450
Yeah, but what the hell
are you gonna do?
We're gonna take a shortcut.

1325
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,938
Hey, you asshole, what are you...
Oh, hi, Roy.

1326
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:41,985
Asshole, my dick!
Did you see about 250 cars
go by here?

1327
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:45,612
No. We heard they're coming.
We haven't seen them yet.
Where the hell are they?

1328
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:48,828
Who cares?
If they haven't gotten here
by now, they'll never make it.

1329
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:51,582
Nothin' to worry about.
Yeah, I think he's right, Boss.

1330
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,543
The only way they can get here
on time is to drive
as the crow flies.

1331
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:57,326
I wouldn't worry about it.
What did you say?

1332
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:02,170
The only way they can get here...
Never mind.
Back up and take a left.

1333
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,479
Shit!

1334
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:25,781
Stop! Stop! Stop!
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1335
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:29,164
[Shouting]
Are you blind?

1336
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,332
Oh!

1337
01:36:38,168 --> 01:36:40,958
You pea-brained ignoramus!

1338
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:48,388
Ohhh, what a beautiful day.

1339
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:54,354
2:30. Whose idea was it
going out to this used car lot?

1340
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:57,814
Shh. I could have been
out playing golf.

1341
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,160
[Fuchs]
There they are.

1342
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,869
All right,
head for the lead truck.

1343
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:18,418
Hey, Rudy,
looks like we got company.

1344
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,250
Fuchs!
What the hell is this?

1345
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,757
Get out
and get in the back.
What?

1346
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:32,675
Get in the damn back!
Come on!
You're crazy.

1347
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:36,234
Don't give me
no goddamn lip!
Get in the goddamn back!

1348
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:42,271
What the hell's he doing?
I don't know.

1349
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:50,704
Hey, Rudy!
You want me to ram
the son of a bitch?

1350
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:54,202
No! Keep going.
Don't stop for anything.
We're running out of time.

1351
01:38:00,458 --> 01:38:03,628
All right, pull over closer now.
Now pull in behind them.

1352
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:09,972
You're supposed to pull in
behind them!

1353
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:14,601
Keep it going, Jim.
Don't stop for anything.
Don't stop!

1354
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:16,892
All right, stop, stop.
Rudy!

1355
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:18,885
Pull this fuckin' thing over!

1356
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:21,647
- He's got a gun!
- Now shoot the son of a bitch.

1357
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,609
You motherfucker you!

1358
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:30,565
Hey, pull over!
Pull it over!
Get off of there!

1359
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:34,485
- [Shouting]
- You motherfucker!

1360
01:38:39,372 --> 01:38:41,582
[Laughing]

1361
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:46,416
[Shouting]
You son of a bitch!
[Laughing]

1362
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:50,337
Keep goin'!

1363
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:52,965
Damn!
Stop it!

1364
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,352
Ow! God!

1365
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:59,310
Slow down.
I want you bad, you fat-ass!

1366
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:04,862
I want you, man!
I gotta have you, man!
I'm gonna get you! Hi-ya!

1367
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,030
Stop it!

1368
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:27,207
- [Laughing]
- Whoa! Heavy duty, brother!

1369
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:30,005
Pull up next to that car!

1370
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:34,681
Whoo!
Hey, thanks
for droppin' in!

1371
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:36,721
Oh, my God!

1372
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,060
Get away from me!
Stop this truck!

1373
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,986
Stop that truck or...
[Screaming]

1374
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,511
Mr. Ghertner,
what am I supposed to do...

1375
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:19,054
when someone is standing
on the hood of my car?

1376
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:21,928
Close in, faster!

1377
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:25,346
Move it up closer!

1378
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,776
Let go of him!

1379
01:40:43,121 --> 01:40:45,711
[Laughing]
Jesus!

1380
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:51,418
You all right?

1381
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:57,628
Billingham, let's move this chariot.

1382
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:01,260
I still may be able
to get in eight holes.

1383
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:21,320
What the hell is this now?
A mirror truck?

1384
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,489
I hope none of them's cracked.

1385
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:40,181
[Screaming]

1386
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:12,127
[Rudy]
Okay, bring 'em in!
Let's go! That's it!

1387
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:14,630
Over to the left.
Move it. That's good.

1388
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:17,212
All right, come on.

1389
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:21,178
All right,
we're gonna fill this lot up.

1390
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,850
That's it!
Keep bringing 'em in!

1391
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:27,020
Get them in there.
Nice job!

1392
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,602
Whoo! We did some
pretty heavy drivin',
huh, girl?

1393
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:35,479
But we missed page 35!
We're here, aren't we?

1394
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:37,686
This motherfucker's all right.

1395
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:40,487
This motherfucking car is bad!
I tell you, man!

1396
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:44,161
Mr. Ghertner, did I pass?
Did I, Mr. Ghertner?
Did I pass the test?

1397
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:49,252
Yes, yes, my dear.
As long as you promise to get
your license in another state.

1398
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:59,337
What time is it?
We got plenty of time.
Look who's coming.

1399
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,599
We've made it!
We've made it!

1400
01:43:07,682 --> 01:43:11,772
Mr. Slaton,
I know you're seeing
the same thing...

1401
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:15,273
with those itty-bitty
beady eyes of yours
that I'm looking at.

1402
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:19,896
I tell you,
that sure looks like
a mile of cars to me.

1403
01:43:19,986 --> 01:43:22,486
Let's just, uh, make sure,
Your Honor.

1404
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:25,242
Measure 'em.
Every one of 'em.
Measure 'em!

1405
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:29,664
Oh, no, sir. That's it.
No, no, no.

1406
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:34,915
I mean, that's a red car.
No, I'm sorry.
I tried, that's all.

1407
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,961
That's a red car.
Oh, no.

1408
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:40,264
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1409
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:42,299
It's a red car.

1410
01:43:42,383 --> 01:43:46,143
The way I figured,
if Jeff don't get here,
