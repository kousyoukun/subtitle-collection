1
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:36,374
It was around 12 o'clock that night

2
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,916
I tossed and turned

3
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,666
I couldn't sleep

4
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,499
Then

5
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,624
My hubby is back

6
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:47,165
As soon as I saw him

7
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,749
I knew something was wrong

8
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,582
2 Characters

9
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:51,540
Pong

10
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:58,415
I could still remember his smile

11
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:00,249
There is something fishy

12
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:02,957
5 Characters.
You'd smell it if it is

13
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,165
And I did

14
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:05,998
5 Characters, Pong for me

15
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,582
Do you feel like crying?

16
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:14,540
"Mrs. Chan - suffering from depression”

17
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:15,957
I walked towards him

18
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:18,707
And I found it

19
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:22,290
A strand of long hair, stuck to him

20
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,916
That night

21
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:25,624
He said he went to play football with friends

22
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,665
All of them are bald

23
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:28,540
Where could it have come from?

24
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,999
Certainly not me

25
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,416
This is for you

26
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:33,832
8 Characters

27
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,124
Close to winning, aren't you

28
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:37,415
Pong again for me

29
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:38,999
- Again?
- Lucky I got it

30
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:40,915
Feel like crying yet?

31
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,541
It's already very difficult

32
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,666
And you are not making it easy for me

33
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,666
Last time

34
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,082
He denied about that secretary

35
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:53,748
And that model

36
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,040
And that nameless celebrity

37
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,124
He denied everything

38
00:01:57,499 --> 00:01:58,457
Be honest

39
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:00,748
- 1 Character
- Does your husband treat you right?

40
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,123
Yes

41
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,374
That's what a woman really needs after all

42
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,290
- 6 Characters
- Pong

43
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:14,082
Pong

44
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:15,498
Pong again?

45
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,332
I win!

46
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:24,790
You thought you can have it your way?

47
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:27,207
What's mine will always be mine

48
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,124
Mrs. Chan, now you understand

49
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:30,873
What?

50
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:32,957
Husbands are like that too

51
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:34,707
What's yours will always be yours

52
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:35,873
They won't run away

53
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:40,040
Suspecting everything will only
make men try to avoid you

54
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,457
Would you rather cry after a broken family

55
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:43,790
Or smile at an intact one?

56
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,249
That's for you to decide

57
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,666
- Hey
- Hey! Hey!

58
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,749
Don't spray at us like this

59
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:51,874
Killing germs like that

60
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:53,290
It could kill us too

61
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,540
From what I heard, one of your F&B conglomerates

62
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,416
Is getting in on an IPO soon, right?

63
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,707
Screw it

64
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:00,040
Why even mention it?

65
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,041
I'm so pissed now

66
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,374
Those good-for-nothings

67
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,207
We planned to go public last year,
but nothing's been done

68
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:05,748
Imagine how much I lost

69
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:06,999
I want to kill them all

70
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,541
Rearrange the tiles

71
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,457
Don't mention it again

72
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,457
Alright

73
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,749
God, I'm pissed

74
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,624
"Mrs. Fong - suffering from mania"

75
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:19,207
Oh, Chow.

76
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:19,957
Pong

77
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:21,165
Excuse me

78
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,166
Why, you...

79
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,207
You always try to get what I'm after

80
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:26,290
Can you really keep up?

81
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,541
I like oversized challenges

82
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,416
Do you remember your best assistant, David?

83
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,416
Where is he working now?

84
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,291
Who would want those good-for-nothings?

85
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,999
I don't care if no one wants them

86
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,040
One betraying is all it takes

87
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,624
He won't dare do that

88
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:40,832
Look at you

89
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:42,457
- Let me get a snap
- He won't dare do that

90
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,373
I tell you

91
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:44,915
If I were David

92
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,291
I'd pack my bags when I see that face

93
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,873
Do you know why I don't get angry

94
00:03:49,874 --> 00:03:53,665
Because a smile can resolve a war

95
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,457
What did I tell you

96
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:56,748
When you get angry

97
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,790
Thousands of nerves on your face get stimulated

98
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,791
When that happens

99
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,541
Even the best botox treatment won't reverse that

100
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:07,707
Oh... Let's continue

101
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,749
Mrs. Li

102
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,666
You were just back from Paris with your husband

103
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:15,165
I see that you had fun on social media

104
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,874
A full bounty of return

105
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,707
We were at Versailles

106
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:19,873
It was pouring outside

107
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,790
Waited for five whole hours

108
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,957
Wow, you must have long waited...

109
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,207
Everything must be closed by then

110
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,874
She's got OCD

111
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:32,165
What's a little shower?

112
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,791
She would wait even if there's a tornado

113
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,832
Look at her

114
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:39,207
She only goes after 13 Wonders in mahjong

115
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:43,082
"Mrs. Li - suffering from
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder"

116
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:49,374
Red Dragon, there you are

117
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,665
Now stay close

118
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:53,957
Not yet?

119
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:57,123
There are still two of those

120
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:59,999
I'll find them myself

121
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,707
Not yet?

122
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:05,832
Damn, did you bring your own tiles?

123
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:14,499
Be good now, I'm just one pair away

124
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,999
Sometimes

125
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,999
Did I Kill your parents or something?

126
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:20,040
Can't you go for other tiles

127
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,874
- Things just don't go the way you expected
- Four of them

128
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,124
All four 1 Characters are out

129
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:29,790
Green Dragon, why are you always late?

130
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,374
Why are you crying?

131
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:34,207
I'm already calling Mahjong

132
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,707
But you disposed all the 1 Characters

133
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:39,415
Sometimes, you can't force 13 Wonders

134
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,999
Just because you wanted to

135
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:47,415
West

136
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,165
Bad Flower tile

137
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,041
What is this, a florist?

138
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,707
- There's more
- Impossible

139
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:04,207
Wait a second. This makes six of them

140
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,123
Look, none of us have any

141
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:07,040
Right

142
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,041
Is it Mahjong with eight Flowers?

143
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:09,874
Yes

144
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:11,749
Mahjong with eight

145
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:13,165
This must be a coincidence

146
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,416
Yes

147
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,707
This must be a coincidence

148
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:20,374
It really is

149
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,124
Flower again

150
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,207
One more to go

151
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,291
God of Mahjong, please make me happy

152
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,624
Flower Mahjong

153
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,332
It's wonderful

154
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:34,082
It really is a Flower

155
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,374
There's no such thing as
perfect planning in the world

156
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:39,082
You couldn't have 13 Wonders

157
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,665
But a Flower Hand is just the same

158
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,166
Congratulations, you deserved it

159
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:48,082
I still prefer 13 Wonders though

160
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:49,957
Hello, Hubbykins

161
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,082
Are you done playing football?

162
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,291
I'll come pick you up

163
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,915
Let's spend the night on a date

164
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,290
Dr. Bo, thank you very much

165
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:01,373
My wife no longer suspects me

166
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:02,957
The money is ready

167
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,540
I just need your account number

168
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,957
Tell everyone to come back

169
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,498
We will have a celebration feast

170
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,624
Tell that heartless David to come too

171
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,374
No...

172
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:14,040
Tell him

173
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,999
We will triple up his salary

174
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,499
So ask him to stay

175
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:19,582
Dr., thank you so much

176
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,498
For helping my wife to be happy again

177
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:22,665
I'll transfer the treatment fee to you

178
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,624
Thank you

179
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:24,665
Daddy

180
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:27,457
I got Mahjong finally

181
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:28,749
Not 13 Wonders

182
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,707
But a Flower Hand

183
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,249
Eight Flowers

184
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:34,707
Dr. Bo

185
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:37,290
It is impressive how you
made my wife get a Flower Mahjong

186
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,416
Thank you

187
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,707
I have made the transfer already

188
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,124
"Famous psychiatrist - Chung Ka Bo"

189
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,416
We got the reply on
when the renovation can be finished

190
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,373
It shall be done within our expected date

191
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,540
Our merchant acquirers gave us some comments

192
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,332
They asked whether if having
six toilets in our 18-storey mall

193
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,041
Would be too few

194
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,624
Customers might pee their pants

195
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:01,790
Do you remember what the boss said

196
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,082
With one less toilet

197
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,165
We can have two more shop spaces

198
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,166
Our company can receive more rent

199
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:13,290
Boss

200
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,832
You could hurt yourself

201
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,207
Put down the hammer

202
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,457
Where did you get the marble

203
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:19,957
We always get it at Old Fat's

204
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,374
Get it from Little Fat's from now on

205
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:22,957
I heard that Little Fai

206
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:25,040
Forged his late father's will,

207
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,374
and tried to steal his brother's share

208
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:27,832
Why stock up from that jerk?

209
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:28,498
Also

210
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:30,665
You lent money to Old Fai last year

211
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:32,165
If you give business to Little Fai now

212
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:33,499
Wouldn't it harm your business?

213
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:36,290
A one million-dollar question

214
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,499
I paid lots of money to hire you

215
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:43,165
And you only bring your empty bodies to work

216
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,332
Where are your brains?

217
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,707
Raise your hand if you know

218
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,749
Raise your hand if you know

219
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,166
You won't even try for a million

220
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,540
The correct answer is

221
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,207
From now on, you will all change your names

222
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:58,749
Do you know to what?

223
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:00,540
"Pigheads”

224
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,749
Because you don't have brains

225
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,207
Now Little Fai has a lawsuit
with Old Fai, am I right?

226
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,749
When we get things from Little Fai

227
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,999
We can bargain and slash the price

228
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,916
As for Old Fai

229
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:14,249
I lent him money

230
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:15,999
But I don't buy from him

231
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,791
Then he'd have nothing to pay me back

232
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,416
I can then merge both companies, bit by bit

233
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:21,790
My biggest desire

234
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,207
Is for them to fight each other

235
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,082
Running a business with no morals

236
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,041
He's doomed to have ugly offspring without asses

237
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,791
Are you cursing me?

238
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,749
Are you cursing me?

239
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:35,499
No, boss

240
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:36,624
It's not what I meant

241
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:37,665
I...

242
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:45,040
What is your name

243
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:45,999
Tyson

244
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,249
How long have you been working here

245
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,332
Three years

246
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:49,790
Not happy with your job? Tell me

247
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,332
No, boss. I'm not unhappy

248
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:53,290
I'm very happy

249
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:58,749
You got a good-looking ass

250
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,623
Boss...

251
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,124
That means your mummy and daddy

252
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,873
Did great deeds in the past

253
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,415
For you to be so handsome

254
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,832
And you are still working under me

255
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,082
Being yelled at every day

256
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,373
You pighead

257
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:15,999
You can't even talk back

258
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,249
Go home and tell them

259
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:24,124
Even when they had done good things in the past

260
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,957
You are still working for me

261
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,666
Being scolded by me

262
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,666
Do you understand, pighead?

263
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,207
Do you understand?

264
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,248
Mummy

265
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:37,332
I want to go home

266
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:43,373
You pigheads dislike me

267
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:44,457
That's fine.

268
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,415
I don't care, I don't care at all

269
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,916
Does anyone want to resign

270
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,166
Raise up your hand

271
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:52,499
You can leave immediately

272
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,332
I have money

273
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,499
To hire some other piece of trash

274
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:57,415
No one?

275
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:58,873
Good

276
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:00,040
Get to work

277
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,707
Now take out your watches

278
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:05,915
From this minute onwards

279
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,874
Even if you are pigheads

280
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,582
You shall live as a greedy pighead

281
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,165
The golden rule of my business

282
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:15,499
"Greed"

283
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:19,374
"Simon Leung - famous tycoon, suspected manic"

284
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:30,416
"Valentine's Day - 13:26"

285
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:43,373
Funny, is there anything to eat?

286
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:46,248
What's with this?

287
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,290
It's just lunch

288
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,624
What's the big deal?

289
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,040
This one's for me

290
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,041
That is for you

291
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,874
What?

292
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,457
You get to eat this much

293
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,374
What did you make me?

294
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:57,874
What's this?

295
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,457
Last week you said you need to go on diet

296
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:00,207
Also

297
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,373
You will be attending
Dr. Yeung's charity ball next month

298
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,499
And ordered that gown for ten thousand dollars

299
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:06,915
To be made from Paris

300
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,332
You said you need to shine like a star on that day

301
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,291
Show me your hand

302
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:12,665
Don't play tricks on me, okay?

303
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:20,957
Boss, you should stop watching
Korean drama and sleep at night

304
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:21,790
What's that to do with you?

305
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,791
It harms your liver

306
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,291
Most importantly

307
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,416
You have bad Yin-yang balance these few years

308
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,415
Shut up

309
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,291
How rude

310
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,416
This herbal juice should be perfect

311
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,499
Seven cups a day

312
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:36,082
Helps you shed some weight and detox

313
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:37,248
If you keep on drinking

314
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:38,207
Ho

315
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:41,123
You'd live long and your beauty never fades

316
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:42,082
Is that true?

317
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:43,165
Bottoms up

318
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,457
Where did you get this?

319
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:55,915
Suffering today brings bliss tomorrow

320
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,082
It's going to be worth it

321
00:13:07,707 --> 00:13:08,457
Hey

322
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,916
Eat if you will,

323
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,457
but don't make it so gross

324
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,957
Are you trying to scorn me?

325
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,582
According to conditioning mechanism in psychology

326
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,707
I am averting your appetite

327
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,874
The more aversive I making it look like

328
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,457
The more revolted you will be

329
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,624
For a cute preppy boy like me

330
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,082
It's a sacrifice to forsake my image and help you

331
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:29,748
You call yourself cute and preppy

332
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:30,874
I want to throw up

333
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:32,165
If you still have good conscience

334
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,582
You should increase my pay

335
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,248
Get out

336
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,374
A patient is waiting for you

337
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:37,207
I said

338
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,540
I will only work for the day's limit

339
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,166
I won't move even for the Chief Executive

340
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,291
Tell him to come again

341
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,582
But you really need her tonight

342
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:48,665
Congratulations, boss

343
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,624
The Asia Chamber of Commerce just called

344
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:53,374
They elected you as this year's
most successful entrepreneur

345
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,957
They want you to attend
the ceremony in Japan next month

346
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:58,123
You know how I hate to get under the spotlight

347
00:13:58,124 --> 00:14:00,707
You go and receive the prize for me next month

348
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,582
Recently Penang's got some good property

349
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,373
We should think about how to get on good deals now

350
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:06,290
I got news that

351
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,832
Philip Lau lost by two votes

352
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,207
And he's outraged

353
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:11,873
He kept telling people it was all arranged

354
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:13,832
I've known him for 40 years

355
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:16,082
He tries to copy me in everything

356
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:17,998
When I do sun tanning, he goes indoor tanning

357
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,499
I live on Jardine's Lookout,
he lives at Jardine's Crescent

358
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:23,915
When I date Miss Hong Kong, he dates Miss Asia

359
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,166
No one can be as low-bred like him

360
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,499
I reckon he is for real this time

361
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,915
My friend saw him at karaoke

362
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:32,790
And he was really drunk

363
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:36,249
Damn you, Simon, you jerk

364
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:38,873
You bully me all the time

365
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:41,290
If I don't teach you a lesson

366
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:43,290
I'm gonna bleach myself white

367
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:44,873
I'm no longer Dark Fortune Philip

368
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:46,957
I'll look for someone to make you pay

369
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:48,999
Don't worry

370
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:50,290
His bark is bigger than his bite

371
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,041
He won't even dare to touch me

372
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,290
How much is his company worth now

373
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:55,415
3.6 per stock

374
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,499
Start buying him company shares bit by bit

375
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:58,665
You want to merge his company

376
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,999
Just to have a little fun

377
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,749
And give him some sleepless nights

378
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:06,082
3 o'clock, meeting at Four Seasons with Mr. Lee
"Valentine's Day - 14:30"

379
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:06,873
5 o'clock
"Valentine's Day - 14:30"

380
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,624
Mr. Chan from Malaysia will come
"Valentine's Day - 14:30"

381
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,457
To explain to us their property

382
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,791
My idol

383
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:16,874
You look so much more handsome than on TV

384
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,499
Let us take a photo

385
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:19,582
We don't do photos. No photos

386
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,748
- Sorry
- Alright, alright

387
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:22,624
Just this once, I'll be leaving tomorrow

388
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,874
Didn't you say you hate the spotlight?

389
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:27,290
"Every step that you take,
you make a difference”

390
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,291
She's just a tourist

391
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,457
Be nice, shall we?

392
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,541
Let's take a photo

393
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,749
Almost time

394
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:35,749
Good

395
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:37,749
Thanks, Leo

396
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:39,707
You're going to be the best actor
of the year for sure

397
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,540
But don't tan yourself anymore

398
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,791
I support you

399
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,332
Now I just need to find Simon Yam

400
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,624
Then I'll have the full collection

401
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:50,207
I said no photos

402
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:51,582
Didn't you see that?
Why didn't you stop her?

403
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,248
Letting random people come near me

404
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:56,082
Boss

405
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,040
Don't run

406
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:02,748
Philip! You tricked me

407
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:04,290
I'll put everything in to play with you

408
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,207
Give me some tissue paper

409
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:06,165
Get the security guards

410
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,332
Are you alright?

411
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:08,248
- Yin
- Here

412
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:10,040
Give Chong a call

413
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,624
Tell him to forget about
buying the stocks bit by bit

414
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:14,749
Just buy the entire company

415
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:15,374
Yes

416
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,040
I will make Philip sleep on the streets

417
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,416
Yes, boss

418
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:24,790
"Valentine's Day - 15:09"

419
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,040
Michelle

420
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,582
What took you so long to call Mummy?

421
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:34,373
Mummy's worried

422
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:36,582
I nearly got caught

423
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:38,623
I ran a few blocks until I could escape

424
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,832
I'm still shivering

425
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,582
It's normal that you feel scared

426
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:43,540
Don't worry

427
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,791
I never thought I would do such crazy things

428
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,499
But when you do

429
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:51,415
Don't you feel a slight tinge of excitement?

430
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,707
Well, I do

431
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,082
Bingo! You are finally smiling

432
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,082
I forced you to do something

433
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,540
out of your character

434
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,957
So that your hidden characters can be discovered

435
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,082
Good for you

436
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:06,873
Now the journey to your healing

437
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,332
Can begin

438
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:10,457
Do I really have to go?

439
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:11,248
Today

440
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:14,249
Is supposed to be your anniversary
with that jerk Lo Jok

441
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,790
And it's Valentines Day

442
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,749
I booked a table at the hotel you often went

443
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,832
You must go and have dinner there

444
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,373
I'm done with him already

445
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,374
Why do I still need to go?

446
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:27,832
To forget someone

447
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:30,165
Is not as easy as you say it

448
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,832
To truly forget

449
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,123
Is when you meet him again

450
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:35,707
You are still be able to see right through him

451
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:36,957
I don't understand

452
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:40,623
That means, if you can finish today's meal

453
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,290
With complete peace and serenity

454
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,666
Then you have truly walked away
from this relationship

455
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,124
Can I really do that?

456
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:50,082
You are my dear daughter

457
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:51,540
You can do it

458
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,374
I'll wait for you to come home happily

459
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,582
And have Chinese New Year's Eve dinner
with the whole family

460
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:58,415
Mum

461
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,666
Did you get in touch with Sis?

462
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,874
Do you think she'd let me find her?

463
00:18:09,874 --> 00:18:11,624
Speak up

464
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,582
What do you mean?
"Valentine's Day - 19:03"

465
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:14,998
The landlord wants to raise the price?
"Valentine's Day - 19:03"

466
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:16,165
What on earth?

467
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:16,957
These necklaces

468
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:18,457
Are our newest designs

469
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,665
You can try and see which one you like

470
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,124
He wants a freaking raise?

471
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:23,582
Let him raise

472
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,582
If you like pink, Miss

473
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:26,915
This one would really suit you

474
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,291
I didn't say I like pink

475
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,791
Why do you say I like pink?

476
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,707
I tell you

477
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:35,873
Get his mother to talk to me

478
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,207
You can't? Then you go c--

479
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,332
- Do you understand?
- Sir

480
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,415
Can you speak quietly on your phone?

481
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,416
You are disturbing my customers

482
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,832
Now I can't even talk on my phone?

483
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,082
I can't buy things

484
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,498
Are you crazy?

485
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,082
Honey

486
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:50,998
Darling

487
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,124
I have what I want

488
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,374
Oh, have you given it a try?

489
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:56,040
Not yet

490
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,291
Then try it out

491
00:18:57,707 --> 00:18:58,957
Is it hard?

492
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:02,873
Very hard! It's not fake

493
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,374
- Awesome
- Miss,

494
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:05,832
you can't bite our diamonds

495
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,415
Why not?

496
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,249
When I purchased gold in my hometown

497
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,415
I had to bite to see if it was real

498
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,166
If you sold me some fake jewelry

499
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,041
Then I will be fooled

500
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,499
Miss, all our diamonds
have the manufacturer's warranty

501
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:20,707
We don't sell fake goods

502
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,207
Couldn't you also forge the papers?

503
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,623
See if you can tell the difference by yourself?

504
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:26,040
You have been here for two hours

505
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,416
If you are not buying from us

506
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,791
Please shop at other places

507
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,957
Honey, she is mean to me

508
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,873
You go and tip her a lesson

509
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,123
Darling, it's teach, not tip

510
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,749
Did you hear that?

511
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:42,124
My wife is angry

512
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:43,165
Either you apologize,

513
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,082
or I'll mess up this place

514
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,665
If you dare! I'll call the police

515
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,457
Wow, you got some guts

516
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:53,082
Honey, leave it. Look at her face

517
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:57,582
She looks like she must have been dumped
by a man recently

518
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,582
That's why she is jealous of a cute couple like us

519
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:03,373
Let us go somewhere else

520
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:06,665
And you be stuck here your whole life

521
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,291
Here, for your whole life,
Here, for your whole life.

522
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,749
- Here, your whole life.
- What now?

523
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,249
Are you angry now?
Why are you glaring at me?

524
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:16,290
What, you want to fight? Come at me

525
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,499
Just try, I'll bring you to court and sue you

526
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,665
- You can't pay even with your body
- come on...

527
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,499
- come on. Try me,
- come on...

528
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,457
Come on, come on. Try me, come on

529
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:28,957
- Come on...
- she must have been dumped by a man recently

530
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:32,082
Why?

531
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:32,957
I don't want you to leave

532
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:36,290
We are not right for each other.
I have another girlfriend

533
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,666
I was dumped. Does it have anything to you?

534
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,457
What if you are in love? What if you are rich?

535
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:43,540
You want to mess us up?

536
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,332
I don't have anything.

537
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:45,332
Go to hell with me

538
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:46,957
Help...

539
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,123
Stop, ouch, It hurts! Crazy woman

540
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:49,957
Stop, ouch, It hurts!

541
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,665
Calm down, calm down

542
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,374
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

543
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:56,290
Manager

544
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,832
What are you doing here?

545
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,082
They are causing trouble

546
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,332
Whatever the customers said,

547
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:01,790
we cannot treat them like that

548
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,624
We are people who provide service

549
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,374
And customers are always right, you know?

550
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:07,290
Manager Chan,

551
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,041
we schemed this "secret customer” project

552
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,999
Isn't it very effective to test out your employees

553
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,707
Well done

554
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,290
I shall put all the company's branches

555
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,999
under your team

556
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:23,915
To test out my employee's abilities

557
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,874
Thank you, Manager Chan

558
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,791
Manager, I haven't yet introduced myself

559
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:29,790
Slow Man, nice to meet you

560
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,832
Oh, here, let me introduce

561
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,915
Yes.

562
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,291
This is my work partner and girlfriend,
Kiki Cheung

563
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,832
We are both drama lovers

564
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:37,832
Yes, we are

565
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,791
Kiki, greet our boss

566
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:40,832
Hello, boss

567
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,040
Damn, you need to express more

568
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,957
Boss

569
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:47,332
Manager, what do we do with Susan?

570
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:49,082
Send that crazy girl home

571
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:50,998
She'll get her employment
termination through email

572
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:51,999
I don't want to see her ever again

573
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,082
What is wrong with him?
Turning against his own people

574
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,457
It's okay

575
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:56,873
Don't leave, please don't

576
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:59,832
Did you see that girl? She's out of her mind

577
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:02,290
She might even have rabies

578
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,707
She's crazy, to lash out like that

579
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:08,790
Are you kidding me? That guy is so stingy

580
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,041
I asked for medical reimbursement,

581
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:11,832
he refused

582
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,915
I'll definitely ask for a raise next time

583
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,957
Hey, you think we will be punished

584
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:17,207
for doing dreadful things?

585
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,873
Kiki, can you not pity others out there?

586
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,999
Think about it. We graduated from
Arts Academy for such a long time

587
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,499
We are passionate about acting. We have dreams

588
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,790
Did God give us any opportunity?

589
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:27,957
How long have we been jobless?

590
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,540
Now someone gave us a chance

591
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,666
And we can act in front of people again

592
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,749
How come we are giving up?

593
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:35,082
How can you tell people that we are actors?

594
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,832
Don't you feel ashamed?

595
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,166
My screenplay is finally done

596
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:40,790
Look,

597
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,582
the money that we made today

598
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:44,707
Is a big step closer for me

599
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:47,748
To bring this gem into the cinemas

600
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:50,207
I promise you

601
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:51,957
You will be the lead actress for my film

602
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:55,332
Will I be the cat or the dog?

603
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,332
You will be a lizard

604
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,082
Lizard?

605
00:22:58,082 --> 00:22:58,748
Yes.

606
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:00,999
In this film, this lizard

607
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:04,540
Is the love interest of the cat and the dog

608
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,707
In other words,

609
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:08,832
it interferes in the relationship
between the cat and the dog

610
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:09,415
Now,

611
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,416
don't you think this character has lots of potential?

612
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,499
It won't be easy to handle

613
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:15,165
Of course it won't, I made it specially for you

614
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,916
So, you don't have to worry about anything else

615
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,374
If you have the time, just think

616
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:21,249
How to immerse yourself in the lizard's movements

617
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:22,749
and psychology

618
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,332
Bad Person calling! Bad Person calling!

619
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:25,998
Bad Person calling! Bad Person calling!

620
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:29,207
What?

621
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:30,790
Your mum again?

622
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,624
Hey, not like she's my real mum

623
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:36,540
Come on, your little sister's
not as begrudged as you are

624
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,791
She is weak-minded, and believes easily.

625
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,166
I told you that.

626
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,666
My problem is that my memory is too good probably.

627
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,957
I will always remember who killed my dad

628
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,248
Is it that serious?

629
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:49,123
What kind of a psychiatrist
hooks up with a patient?

630
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:51,873
One day, my dad went out to sea

631
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,541
And he never came back

632
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:55,332
That doesn't mean she has to do with it

633
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:57,415
She knew my dad is hydrophobic,

634
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,166
and she gave him a yacht?

635
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,124
Giving him a plane
doesn't mean he could fly it too

636
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:03,207
What, why are you defending that woman?

637
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,082
If you hate that woman,

638
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,416
why don't we...

639
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:07,748
Make a plan

640
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:09,790
and steal all her money

641
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,791
Then you can star as the lizard very soon

642
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,374
Anyway, I said it.

643
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:15,540
I won't see that woman ever again

644
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,291
And I'm not playing the lizard anymore

645
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,749
Why not? I characterized it specially for you

646
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,666
Only you can do it

647
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,832
Honestly, why a lizard?

648
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:29,123
Is my tongue forked?

649
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,666
It isn't now, you know that

650
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:33,540
Dr. Bo, what took you so long?

651
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,624
Our boss has been waiting

652
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:36,457
Today is Valentine's Day, there's traffic everywhere

653
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:37,748
Did I speak to you?

654
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:39,040
"Valentine's Day - 20:33"
Stop barging into conversations, steward

655
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,707
Steward? Then what are you, a maid?

656
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:41,623
What are you calling me? Steward

657
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:42,124
- Maid,
- Steward,

658
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:44,582
- Steward...
- Maid...

659
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,582
Maid.

660
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,124
Stop.

661
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:50,749
What is the condition now?

662
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,165
Our boss is losing bad

663
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,207
Four words, like a sinking ship

664
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:57,040
Philip you loser, what are you waiting for?

665
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:59,749
What's the fuss? Just wait

666
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:00,915
Welcome

667
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,874
My Goddess

668
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:04,165
I've been waiting.

669
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:06,748
Please have a seat. Scram...

670
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:07,999
Please have a seat.

671
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:12,873
Hey, Philip

672
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:14,707
Need a chick to give you guts?

673
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:15,748
What are you saying?

674
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,498
You can laugh at me,
but not my goddess

675
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,666
Want me to burn down your whole family?

676
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,916
If you don't like it,
I can kill all of them

677
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,374
They are like that

678
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:27,124
Nothing good comes out of their mouths

679
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:29,790
I haven't looked at the cards,
I'm waiting until you come

680
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:30,666
Look at it, look at it

681
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,832
I won't if you don't look first

682
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,957
Hm, I like that. Deal the cards

683
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:49,082
Three 4s

684
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:50,623
It's gonna be a full house or a four-of-a-kind

685
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:53,915
5 million

686
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,832
Two identical suits,

687
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,166
this looks like four-of-a-kind

688
00:25:59,207 --> 00:25:59,832
Well

689
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:02,082
Gonna be fun

690
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:03,957
Great!

691
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,291
Now, no turning back

692
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,457
If you win, I quit gambling for three months

693
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,915
If you lose

694
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,249
You will go out and have dinner
and watch a movie with me

695
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:15,457
Do you want me to win, or to lose?

696
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,415
Of course lose, am I right?

697
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,082
What is a few million dollars?

698
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:20,748
Just change to me

699
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:21,957
I won't even bother about it

700
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,123
You, on the other hand

701
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,415
Have never gone out with me

702
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,707
since we met

703
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,707
As a doctor, it is my principle

704
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:31,832
Not to have private meetings with a patient

705
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,165
Why do you come then?

706
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,249
The best way to treat a gambling addict

707
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:40,415
Is not to prohibit gambling

708
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:43,124
You need a visible goal to gamble

709
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:45,790
And my treatment is to help you win

710
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,332
So you will quit for three months

711
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:51,207
While it does not go to the heart of the problem

712
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:54,582
It will at least relieve your illness

713
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:55,623
right?

714
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:59,207
Admit it, you just want to see me, dummy

715
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,832
Look at your cards, do you think you can win?

716
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,832
I have calculated everything

717
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,123
Zodiacs, astrology, Tarot reading

718
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:10,124
And I got an unlucky spot fixed
by a Feng Shui master

719
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:12,165
With an lucky charm overhead

720
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:15,790
When you sat down, did you feel cold

721
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,207
And unsettled?

722
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,082
There are many spirits here haunting you

723
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,957
Bad luck turn and bad luck flee

724
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:21,915
Only good fortune, come to me

725
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,707
Today my worst day

726
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,707
I will lose every bet

727
00:27:25,707 --> 00:27:28,332
I am confident in losing everything tonight

728
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:29,790
I can definitely have dinner with you tonight

729
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,374
I'm so clever

730
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,415
Why am I handsome
and clever at the same time?

731
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:00,540
Hearts, are you scared?

732
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,041
No

733
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:04,165
Three sides

734
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:06,790
It's 7

735
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,790
Hard to lose

736
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:11,790
Player with the strongest hand, please act

737
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,791
Don't mind if I decide on your part?

738
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,707
No

739
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,040
Any problem with that?

740
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:16,999
Five million

741
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,207
Five million it is

742
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:20,582
Five million

743
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,332
Mr. Lee, with such a big bet

744
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:26,373
Need to call your wife first?

745
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,374
What is it

746
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,666
It's just five millions

747
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,624
I call

748
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:35,415
Same

749
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,041
I am the youngest here

750
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:38,707
Can do nothing but call

751
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:44,832
Just a Flush hand, nothing to fear

752
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:45,998
Let's see

753
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:48,499
Full house, 4s over 9s

754
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,291
Open it, open it

755
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,124
Full house, Aces over 9s

756
00:28:53,124 --> 00:28:54,165
Thank you

757
00:28:56,749 --> 00:28:57,790
My Goddess

758
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:58,916
Full house

759
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:01,124
The 9s are all out, how do we win?

760
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:03,207
I said I have the worst luck today

761
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:04,873
You should think about where to have dinner later

762
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:06,707
You guys like 9s

763
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:08,123
Then take them

764
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:10,790
I'm waiting for this card all along

765
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:17,041
Amazing! A Straight Flush!

766
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:18,749
Why did I get a 47

767
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:20,540
No, why did you get a 4?

768
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,291
Isn't today my worst day of the year?

769
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:23,957
Silly, you have bad luck

770
00:29:23,957 --> 00:29:26,998
But my boss is shining from within,
full force and unstoppable

771
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,957
Mr. Lau

772
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,791
I've done my part at least to
help you win the game

773
00:29:31,082 --> 00:29:32,207
As for the treatment bill

774
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:34,457
Ask someone to pay it on time

775
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:35,165
Also

776
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,416
No turning back on your words

777
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,165
No gambling for three months

778
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:39,290
Funny

779
00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:40,248
Let's go

780
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,415
Happy Valentine's Day, Silly Billy

781
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:43,998
What

782
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,916
You might need her tonight

783
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,332
I don't want to be a dealer anymore

784
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,957
Customers never tip me even when they won

785
00:29:54,957 --> 00:29:57,123
When they lost, they take it out on you

786
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:58,665
I have insomnia every night

787
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,623
What can I do at night then?

788
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,749
Online shopping

789
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:04,457
My shopaholism is getting serious

790
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:06,248
And I'm high on credit card debts

791
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:08,957
With such low wages

792
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:11,082
I can't even afford for one session with you, Dr. Bo

793
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,707
So I told myself

794
00:30:12,707 --> 00:30:13,832
I will find a new job

795
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:16,415
And I must be able to help others

796
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,332
And I must be able to help others

797
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,873
And to do whatever I wish

798
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,374
Tonight, there's an event

799
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:22,999
Where you can really help me out

800
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,124
Help me cheat in this game

801
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:27,915
Best if you could control everything in the process

802
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:31,624
Most importantly,
you'll be satisfied with the payment

803
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:33,082
How satisfied?

804
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,498
One million in a lump sum

805
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,457
Is there more than one event?

806
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:48,790
"Valentine's Day - 21:16"

807
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:53,457
Happy Valentine's Day, Miss Chung

808
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:54,207
Manager, hello

809
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:55,790
Why are you waiting on your own?

810
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,082
Is your boyfriend late?

811
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,165
What a shame...

812
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,791
Did you break up?

813
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:03,874
My boyfriend won't come

814
00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:06,707
He is dead

815
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:08,623
In a car crash

816
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:12,082
His car crashed into the hills in a "bang"

817
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:14,915
And the fire roasted him, burnt him

818
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,582
Burning, and, it's painful

819
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:21,082
Just before he died, he called out,
"Help! Help! Help!"

820
00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:25,082
I'm sorry Miss Chung

821
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:27,665
Sorry for your loss

822
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,624
Just tell me if you need anything

823
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:30,790
Hey, manager

824
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:31,374
Yes

825
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:32,582
What's are your recommendations for today?

826
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:33,832
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Chung

827
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:35,248
Since today is Valentine's Day

828
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:36,499
All our guests

829
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:39,874
Will be served "Two in Love" Dinner Set

830
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,666
Which might not suit you now

831
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,874
But it's fine

832
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:43,790
How about

833
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,166
We ask our chef

834
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,624
To prepare for you

835
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:49,957
Some Michelin-grade vegetarian dish

836
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:54,082
But a set costs less,
ala carte dishes are expensive

837
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,082
I'll stick with the set

838
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,165
"Two in Love"

839
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,999
I'll bring you champagne and the appetizer

840
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:01,790
But I'll also bring you a vegetarian dish

841
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:02,916
Thanks

842
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:09,207
What a good appetite after her boyfriend's death

843
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:15,415
Boss is coming back for a meeting,
clear out the floor

844
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,666
That's serious

845
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:21,166
I'm sorry for the inconvenience

846
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:23,915
Oh, Miss Chung

847
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:25,457
I'm very sorry

848
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,290
To tell you some bad news

849
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,916
Why is everybody leaving?

850
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,666
Our hotel

851
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,166
Has a spa

852
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:36,165
And a sewer pipe burst

853
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,582
But my colleagues

854
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,415
Without mentioning, went to mend it

855
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,124
But then, who knew

856
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,374
Even the sewer pipe at the gym bursted

857
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:47,124
But my colleagues didn't learn from the past

858
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:49,915
And they went to mend it

859
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:53,749
Which made the sewer pipe beneath
our kitchen to burst too

860
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:55,540
Now the sewage is gushing out

861
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,707
That's why, our restaurant is closing

862
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:02,040
But don't you worry

863
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,707
The meal is on us

864
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:05,832
And because you are our valued customer

865
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:08,832
We will give you some coupons for free

866
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,623
So you can go to our spa for free once

867
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,290
And to our gym for free once

868
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,916
And also enjoy a free tour around our kitchen

869
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,248
I guarantee you, there won't be faeces

870
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:21,624
But I haven't finished,
how can you tell me to leave

871
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,374
I'm putting it like this already, won't you leave?

872
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:26,540
But my boyfriend's dead

873
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:28,374
"Your boyfriend died",

874
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,207
this is in past tense

875
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,957
"Sewage is gushing out",

876
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:34,082
is present continuous tense

877
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:39,040
I planned to spend this Valentine's Day on my own

878
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:44,332
To think about my boyfriend
who was turned into charcoal

879
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:49,957
Seems like even a humble wish like that

880
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:52,957
Is impossible to be fulfilled

881
00:33:52,957 --> 00:33:54,748
Miss Chung, how about this

882
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:57,582
Let me prepare you a VIP room

883
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:00,207
So you can have a mourning
banquet before you leave?

884
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,540
But the bill

885
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,624
is one us

886
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,457
And the coupons?

887
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:04,498
All free

888
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:05,499
The champagne

889
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:06,665
Is nice, right? It's Cristel

890
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:10,041
Give her a dozen to knock herself out

891
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:17,748
"Valentine's Day - 22:03"

892
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:28,957
Janet, you buy at $3.8

893
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:31,957
You, sell at $2.8

894
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:36,249
You, buy at $5.6

895
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:40,790
Sell at $6.5

896
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,874
You, sell at $13.3

897
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:44,790
Okay

898
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:51,707
Today is Valentine's Day

899
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:54,582
And you all put off your loved
ones for this meeting

900
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:55,665
It's not easy

901
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:56,790
When you leave,

902
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,707
get some snacks to make them happy

903
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:05,582
This time's reward is ever better

904
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:08,582
You were eyeing on that new car,
Now you can pay premium

905
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:11,248
I can take my whole family on holiday

906
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:13,040
I can buy diamonds

907
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:15,415
Boss

908
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,374
The boss has no time for you tonight.

909
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:18,540
Wait at home

910
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,415
Boss, you tipped me on 425 two days back

911
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:23,707
When the market opened today
it crashed and got suspended

912
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,290
I've lost all my savings

913
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,540
Please lend me five million to repair the damage

914
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,874
When did I gave you a tip on 4257

915
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:32,540
You eavesdropped on my phone call

916
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:35,707
Boss, you can take it that I was wrong or crazy

917
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:38,123
But you gotta help me! Just five million will do

918
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:41,373
I've waited for three years to get you

919
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:43,457
You still remembered

920
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:45,165
when I lead others to another company?

921
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,916
But last year you said you would let it go,

922
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,707
when I came back

923
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,082
You doubled my salary

924
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,249
You even lent me money to purchase a flat

925
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:56,290
I could bring you up high enough

926
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,457
to make you fall hard

927
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,873
I waited until you paid the premium for your house

928
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:04,249
Before I gave it to you

929
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,457
Boss, even if that's the case

930
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,915
Even if I'm in the wrong,
I beg you, please save me

931
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:11,207
Please help, just five million

932
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:13,623
George! If I were you

933
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:15,374
I'd sell your watch, and your car

934
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:18,249
And take the million dollars to hide in Dongguan

935
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:20,749
Stop showing your face for nothing

936
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:22,582
I beg you, you gotta save me

937
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:23,415
Big Keung and Small Keung,

938
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,374
- bring him away
- Boss, I beg you

939
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:26,707
I can't save myself even if I kill myself

940
00:36:26,707 --> 00:36:27,957
Not even if I kill myself

941
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:30,457
Boss, please, Boss...

942
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,332
Yin, go home in my car today

943
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:33,290
Why?

944
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,166
You said Philip wants to ambush me.

945
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,707
See if that's true

946
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:37,582
What?

947
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,040
Boss

948
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:43,749
Boss

949
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,374
Aren't you fired?

950
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:46,957
What are you still doing here?

951
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:48,832
I really need money to save lives

952
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,707
Help me this once

953
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:51,915
I don't repeat my words

954
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,207
I beg you, just this once

955
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:56,623
If you do, I'll do anything for you

956
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,957
Why don't you go to Emperor Finance

957
00:36:58,957 --> 00:37:00,790
You can get your property mortgaged too

958
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,249
You have to repay your loans though.

959
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:03,582
Don't pay any intermediaries

960
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:05,373
I owe you nothing now

961
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:06,791
Then I'm sorry, Boss

962
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,416
Philip said he'll pay for my debt

963
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:10,332
Hey, what are you doing?

964
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:19,082
How could they demand that I leave?
I haven't finished eating

965
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:25,498
Oh, the coupons

966
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,499
Richard forgot them

967
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,540
Hey

968
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,332
Bring that chick here

969
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:35,957
Come here

970
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:39,123
It's painful

971
00:37:42,207 --> 00:37:43,873
George, it's me you want

972
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:45,082
Leave her out of this

973
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:47,207
You can't even save yourself

974
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,416
Girl

975
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,666
Step back, I'm here to protect you.
Don't' be scared

976
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:52,874
Take it

977
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:09,124
Are you done posing? Hit her

978
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,499
So you are good at fighting? Good at fighting?

979
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:48,374
Good at fighting?

980
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,666
Still want to fight?

981
00:38:57,832 --> 00:39:00,082
You are lucky this time. I'll be back

982
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:00,873
Leave

983
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:02,332
Go, go, go.

984
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,082
Thank you

985
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,249
Did you steal someone's wife or owe them money?

986
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,332
You got a lot of enemies

987
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,499
Not many girls can fight like you do

988
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:16,207
Can't girls fight?

989
00:39:16,207 --> 00:39:17,123
Are you discriminating against females?

990
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:18,165
No, I wouldn't dare

991
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:20,416
I am afraid you would beat me up

992
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:22,416
Don't worry, I only beat up bad guys

993
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,374
Never good guys

994
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:24,332
How do you know I'm not the bad guy?

995
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:27,123
You are so old but you still try to protect me

996
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:28,790
You can't be very bad

997
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:31,998
Richard is off work now

998
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,790
This is all your fault

999
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:36,249
If it weren't for you,
I would have gotten those coupons

1000
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,707
What coupons? Are they important?

1001
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,082
Of course!

1002
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:42,957
The dessert buffet in this hotel is very delicious

1003
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,582
You like it? I can treat you to one

1004
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:49,040
It's closed, stop bluffing

1005
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:50,457
I own this hotel

1006
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:55,999
Is this enough? I can send for more if you want

1007
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,541
Bring it on

1008
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,624
You sure you don't want some?
"Valentine's Day - 23:02"

1009
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,124
It's delicious
"Valentine's Day - 23:02"

1010
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:03,207
I don't like dessert
"Valentine's Day - 23:02"

1011
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:04,457
You don't like dessert

1012
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:06,582
Your life must be gloomy

1013
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,707
Or you could try have a sip of wine, for a change

1014
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,916
A sip of wine in times of weariness

1015
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,207
Will make you more relaxed

1016
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:14,623
I'm not weary

1017
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:24,915
I'd rather him be dead

1018
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:29,165
He should be happy now, and having great fun

1019
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:30,916
Cuddling with another woman

1020
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:34,165
Do you know who that woman is?

1021
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:38,040
My best friend

1022
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:43,374
My other boyfriends were even more ridiculous

1023
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,624
Each of them, would go away, after a short while

1024
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:47,749
And after that

1025
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:51,707
They would get married
and have kids, just like that

1026
00:40:51,707 --> 00:40:52,707
Last year

1027
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:54,665
I went for face-reading

1028
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:58,207
He said it is in my fate, I'm like the Buddha

1029
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:01,623
I get loads of admirers, and I bless them all

1030
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,040
I'm more effective than a charm

1031
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,957
He could have printed my face on paper
and worshipped me

1032
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,165
This is what they call
"riding a donkey to find a horse"

1033
00:41:09,832 --> 00:41:10,832
Now they got the horse,

1034
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,041
who would remember you, the donkey?

1035
00:41:13,374 --> 00:41:15,457
Why can't I be the horse?

1036
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:17,665
Because you are used to being a donkey

1037
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,666
Why won't you put your mind to being just a horse?

1038
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,957
You got a point there

1039
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:27,957
Why haven't I thought of it?

1040
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:29,957
Cheers

1041
00:41:31,457 --> 00:41:32,540
To you

1042
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:37,248
I'm the horse

1043
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:49,957
Hello, friends up there

1044
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,082
Do you see me?

1045
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:09,749
Answer me, am I the most beautiful horse

1046
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:10,457
You are a donkey

1047
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:11,957
I'm a horse

1048
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:12,790
Donkey

1049
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:13,582
Horse

1050
00:42:13,582 --> 00:42:14,332
Donkey

1051
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,915
Dare say it again?

1052
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,041
You are a donkey

1053
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,957
Boss, weren't you assaulted by someone?

1054
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:26,999
Seems like you are the one doing it

1055
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,499
Am I in the way?

1056
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:36,707
"Valentine's Day - 23:46"

1057
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:49,499
Happy Valentine's to me,
"Valentine's Day - 23:59"

1058
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:52,332
"Valentine's Day - 23:59"

1059
00:42:52,374 --> 00:42:55,165
and to you
"Valentine's Day, is over"

1060
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:04,832
This is Simon Leung.

1061
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,582
Keep this phone.
Let's have dinner some other time

1062
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,541
Our job today

1063
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:13,249
is to help the real estates company
scare two elderly people away

1064
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:16,124
These are our targets, Mr. and Mrs. Lui

1065
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:20,249
The company is done acquiring all the old buildings

1066
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:23,207
Except for theirs, they won't leave

1067
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:24,623
That's why we are here to tackle them

1068
00:43:24,624 --> 00:43:27,415
I saw on a ghost rumours website

1069
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:30,041
This place is super haunted. See for yourselves

1070
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:35,082
Hello, this is Simon Lui. It has been a while

1071
00:43:35,582 --> 00:43:39,582
This is where a harrowing
family murder case was staged

1072
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:43,041
A butcher living here
found out his wife to be cheating

1073
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:46,332
And he grabbed a knife,
hacked her neck for 17 times

1074
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,666
Until he chopped her head off

1075
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,499
After that, he stood here,

1076
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:52,999
and jumped from here

1077
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,749
After the tragedy

1078
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,166
The neighbourhood would see

1079
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,207
Every night, the butcher with his wife's head,

1080
00:44:01,207 --> 00:44:04,332
wandering here and there

1081
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:05,623
Saying the same thing

1082
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:09,415
"Kill every soul. Give nothing back"

1083
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,957
Are you sure?

1084
00:44:11,957 --> 00:44:13,498
How can you believe in Simon Lui?

1085
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:15,124
It's better safe than sorry.

1086
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:16,249
I'm not doing it

1087
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:17,665
Since when are you such a sissy?

1088
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:18,832
What about our friendship?

1089
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:23,040
My zodiac offends Tai Sui this year.
I have bad luck

1090
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,207
I quit

1091
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:25,248
Hey

1092
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:26,415
I will hold on to the clothes first

1093
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,416
Holy shit

1094
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,291
- You told us to come in the first place
- Go

1095
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,332
Who else?

1096
00:44:31,332 --> 00:44:33,207
I am not afraid of anything.

1097
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,832
I'm staying

1098
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:37,165
A courageous spirit, you see

1099
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:38,624
I have something to say

1100
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:42,040
I'm afraid of ghosts,
but I'm afraid of being poor too

1101
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,999
Now that he's gone

1102
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:46,040
Can we split his share of money?

1103
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:48,082
Anyway you like it

1104
00:44:48,082 --> 00:44:49,457
No problem with us then

1105
00:44:49,457 --> 00:44:51,248
We work as a team, don't we

1106
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:52,165
Sure thing

1107
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,082
Here's the plan

1108
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:56,665
Lui returns every day at 8pm after running errands

1109
00:44:57,082 --> 00:44:58,623
You will hide in the lift,

1110
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:01,290
and scare the crap out of him

1111
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,207
With this outfit and some of your acting

1112
00:45:04,207 --> 00:45:07,373
Scaring him will be a piece of cake

1113
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:14,498
Mrs. Lui comes out every day at 8:15pm

1114
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,249
To throw garbage away in the stairs

1115
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:21,249
Hung, that shall be your job

1116
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,666
I am out of food

1117
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,457
Can you burn me some more?

1118
00:45:30,832 --> 00:45:33,332
Lui's coming, be alert

1119
00:45:33,332 --> 00:45:34,207
Okay

1120
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:37,791
This is bad.
If they take the shock badly at this age

1121
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,999
And if anything happens to them,
we'll be condemned

1122
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:42,582
We may be doing something bad today

1123
00:45:42,582 --> 00:45:43,707
But come to think of it,

1124
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,290
when we becom famous

1125
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:47,749
These will all be precious memories of
how we enriched our acting

1126
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:49,957
What if we have to write autobiographies,
and go on TV shows

1127
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:51,915
Like SNL, without anything to share? Understand?

1128
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,457
Promise me this is going to be our last

1129
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:58,999
We love acting, not scaring people

1130
00:45:59,332 --> 00:46:01,332
He's coming, get ready

1131
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:09,374
Why is there no one? Where have they gone?

1132
00:46:09,374 --> 00:46:10,249
Hey

1133
00:46:10,582 --> 00:46:13,457
Are you taking the lift or not?
Don't block my way to hell

1134
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:15,832
Run! Run

1135
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:19,415
Chi, why are you like that?

1136
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:22,291
The Observatory says it's 3 degrees today,
you aren't wearing anything

1137
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,207
Coming

1138
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:27,749
Granny,

1139
00:46:28,457 --> 00:46:31,082
I am out of food

1140
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:33,207
Can you burn me some more?

1141
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,915
Sure,

1142
00:46:35,582 --> 00:46:39,165
let us share mine

1143
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,541
No one is answering the phone

1144
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:53,082
I'll go and find them

1145
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,624
Kill every soul,

1146
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:58,790
- give nothing back
- The butcher, the butcher

1147
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:02,373
Go, go, go, go, go

1148
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:05,915
It's a ghost

1149
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,124
Don't scare me

1150
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,040
- Darn it, Let's go
- what are you saying?

1151
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,249
Where to?

1152
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:11,082
Downstairs

1153
00:47:11,082 --> 00:47:12,373
Ghosts downstairs, Upstairs

1154
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,874
There's more up there

1155
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,374
What should we do now?

1156
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,249
In the middle, go

1157
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,624
We had lots of fun today

1158
00:47:20,624 --> 00:47:22,165
This candy is actually delicious

1159
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,124
I'm done,

1160
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:24,999
how about you?

1161
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:27,874
They wouldn't have guessed,
we hacked into their tablets

1162
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:29,874
And changed up the screen

1163
00:47:29,874 --> 00:47:31,415
The young ones nowadays

1164
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:34,082
Have no common sense with IT stuff

1165
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:36,457
And no imagination whatsoever

1166
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:38,415
When trying to be ghosts

1167
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,041
Way too naive

1168
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,374
to scare us

1169
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:42,832
This city is hopeless

1170
00:47:43,749 --> 00:47:45,457
Thanks to my brother for making

1171
00:47:45,457 --> 00:47:46,832
this place sound haunted

1172
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:48,290
For us to be this scary

1173
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,832
Simon Lui...

1174
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:52,915
is righteous at all times

1175
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,916
Neighbours

1176
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:55,748
around would see the butcher

1177
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:58,915
with his wife every night

1178
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:00,166
Cut.

1179
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,041
Tell Simon to be more serious

1180
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:06,124
I haven't been in Hong Kong for a while.
Recording work got slow

1181
00:48:06,124 --> 00:48:07,832
Check, check.

1182
00:48:07,832 --> 00:48:11,123
Lo Hoi-pang testing, one two three four five

1183
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:13,541
Michael

1184
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,749
This is too loud, just tune it down

1185
00:48:15,749 --> 00:48:19,082
How do you do it, just do it yourself

1186
00:48:19,874 --> 00:48:21,040
Quick...

1187
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:21,791
Where are we going?

1188
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,749
Quick

1189
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,499
I'm scared, what do we do?

1190
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:26,873
It's locked

1191
00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:29,290
What now?

1192
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:31,999
Come

1193
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,457
Jump,

1194
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:34,957
there's no time to lose

1195
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,207
It's high up here

1196
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:38,124
He's coming, quick

1197
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,290
It's gonna be alright, c'mon

1198
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:42,332
Trust in yourself. One, two, three

1199
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:44,374
It's fine...

1200
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,416
I'm ready

1201
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:47,373
Quick

1202
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,582
Quick

1203
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:52,582
I'm scared, carry me

1204
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:55,123
Come, Kiki. Jump

1205
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:56,207
- Jump
- No

1206
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:57,457
We don't have time, they are coming

1207
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,040
Almost there...

1208
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:09,748
Kiki, Kiki

1209
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:18,457
Kiki

1210
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,707
- Sis
- Kiki

1211
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,790
Hello, Auntie

1212
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:23,873
You came to see your daughter?
You are very kind

1213
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:24,749
Who are you?

1214
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:25,832
[, I'm Slow Man

1215
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,123
Kiki's boyfriend

1216
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:28,832
Why is my sister like this?

1217
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,582
I don't know,
I'm waiting for the doctor's diagnosis

1218
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:32,290
What made her become like this all of a sudden?

1219
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,291
I don't know anything about it

1220
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:35,124
I came right after I knew

1221
00:49:35,374 --> 00:49:36,207
Are you sure you have nothing to do with it?

1222
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:36,790
Nothing

1223
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:37,582
You look nervous

1224
00:49:37,582 --> 00:49:39,040
Do 1?7 No, it's just warm in here

1225
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,249
I'm sure you pushed her down

1226
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:41,249
- Surely not
- Sure did

1227
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:42,124
- Did not
- Look at me

1228
00:49:42,124 --> 00:49:43,124
- Look, look at you
- Scared?

1229
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:43,790
- Scared?
- Not scared, not scared.

1230
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:44,707
- Trying to run?
- Not trying to run

1231
00:49:44,707 --> 00:49:46,290
Look at me. Did you?

1232
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:47,291
- May... maybe
- Did you or did you not?

1233
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:49,749
- It must be you
- Is this the market or something?

1234
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:52,040
This is the hospital, this is too noisy

1235
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,457
Doctor, good timing

1236
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,207
How is my daughter?

1237
00:49:54,207 --> 00:49:55,082
She?

1238
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:56,707
Jumping from such height

1239
00:49:57,082 --> 00:49:59,832
Lucky that she landed on a canopy
which reduced the impact

1240
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:01,498
Her limbs are intact

1241
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,165
Though there was a slight concussion

1242
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,291
- But then
- Doctor,

1243
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:05,749
in the current circumstances

1244
00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:07,832
If you say "but", you make us nervous

1245
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:08,957
Why don't you just tell us the truth?

1246
00:50:08,957 --> 00:50:12,040
I got X-ray scans for her, see

1247
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:15,124
A blood lump the size of a fist,

1248
00:50:15,374 --> 00:50:16,665
seems dangerous

1249
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,707
Dangerous?

1250
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:19,748
Why didn't you operate on her?

1251
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:22,040
I examined the patient, and interestingly

1252
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:25,124
At this age, her cranium
is not fully developed yet

1253
00:50:25,124 --> 00:50:28,874
And the lump coincidentally filled that gap

1254
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:31,457
If I operate on her

1255
00:50:31,457 --> 00:50:32,665
She might become retarded

1256
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:33,707
But then

1257
00:50:33,707 --> 00:50:35,415
Darn you, I told you not to say "but"

1258
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:36,791
Just say it

1259
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,041
Exactly. The old geezer speaks recklessly

1260
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,041
After examination

1261
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,791
She shows slight memory loss
and retarded intelligence

1262
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,582
How much has she got now?

1263
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,373
Four Years Old

1264
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,290
What?

1265
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:48,749
What she needs the most now, is family support

1266
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:50,790
Does she have a boyfriend or a husband?

1267
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:52,416
Boyfriend? Me?

1268
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:54,998
Not good, I should leave

1269
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:58,457
She does, they are very much in love

1270
00:50:58,457 --> 00:50:59,457
Where's the boyfriend?

1271
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,041
Where's the zombie?

1272
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,707
Where did the zombie go?

1273
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:03,623
Just ignore it

1274
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,124
I saw that zombie

1275
00:51:05,124 --> 00:51:06,207
He left early

1276
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:07,832
Doctor,

1277
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,498
when will my daughter wake up

1278
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,332
Fastest, it could be in three to five minutes

1279
00:51:11,332 --> 00:51:13,207
If things are slow

1280
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:14,498
It might take several years

1281
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:16,582
I own this hotel

1282
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:17,582
Kiki

1283
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:19,165
But then

1284
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,957
Darn, how dare you say "but" again, jeez

1285
00:51:20,957 --> 00:51:22,540
I'll teach you not to,

1286
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:23,541
I'll mess this place up

1287
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,416
What did you say? I dare you do it

1288
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,207
There can be miracles, though

1289
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:29,373
Try saying that again,

1290
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:30,499
and I'll get people to come

1291
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:34,790
Boss, she's responding

1292
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,332
Now I'm lying, am II? She's waking up

1293
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:39,915
"Mess my place", you don't have a clue

1294
00:51:40,124 --> 00:51:42,290
Ignore him. What shall we eat today?

1295
00:51:42,624 --> 00:51:43,624
Mommy

1296
00:51:43,957 --> 00:51:44,957
Mommy

1297
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:46,957
Mommy

1298
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:48,707
- Kiki
- Mom

1299
00:51:49,082 --> 00:51:50,373
She remembers you

1300
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:51,332
Yes

1301
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:52,582
Sis

1302
00:51:53,332 --> 00:51:53,957
It's scary

1303
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:56,332
Don't be scared, Mommy's here

1304
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:57,790
Do you recognize me? Give me a hug

1305
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,749
Yucky

1306
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:01,541
Mommy, hungry

1307
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:02,457
You hungry?

1308
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:03,874
Mommy will get something for you

1309
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:04,915
Mommy cook

1310
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:05,916
What would you like?

1311
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,623
I want Maotai

1312
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,540
Maotai liquor? Who taught you that?

1313
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:13,915
Brad Pitt and Tony Leung

1314
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:24,791
Hello

1315
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:29,124
I planned to throw this away

1316
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:31,874
If you really wanted to,
you would have already done it

1317
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,415
You won't keep it with you

1318
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:35,624
Or have it charged to wait for my call

1319
00:52:35,624 --> 00:52:37,540
So? What's the matter?

1320
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:40,373
I want to take you out for dinner

1321
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:41,374
What are you eating?

1322
00:52:41,832 --> 00:52:42,707
You decide

1323
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,499
Hey, wait for a bit

1324
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,374
What up?

1325
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,124
Hey, where are you?

1326
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:50,874
Mong Kok. What's up?

1327
00:52:50,874 --> 00:52:53,874
Come to Wan Chai immediately. Intrusion mission

1328
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:54,915
What intrusion?

1329
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,166
I just heard

1330
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:58,291
That stupid ex-boyfriend of yours,

1331
00:52:58,291 --> 00:52:59,916
Lo Jok, and that slut Anna

1332
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:03,124
Are coming to my karaoke bar
to host a birthday party

1333
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:04,957
And he is going to propose

1334
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:07,957
I told King and Jen
to come crash the party.

1335
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:09,124
We just need you now

1336
00:53:09,124 --> 00:53:10,915
Bring some friends too if you can

1337
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,624
Who can I find in such a hurry

1338
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:14,249
Oh, anyone will do

1339
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:15,707
Get as many people as you can

1340
00:53:15,707 --> 00:53:18,248
We shouldn't be the minority there,
I'll be waiting for you

1341
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:26,499
Hello

1342
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:28,582
Made up your mind?

1343
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,040
Let's go for karaoke before dinner, shall we?

1344
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:40,665
Lo Jok

1345
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:43,957
Yo

1346
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:47,790
What's up

1347
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:48,499
Michelle,

1348
00:53:49,082 --> 00:53:49,873
why are you here?

1349
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:51,290
We were singing next door

1350
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,999
Just to see a slut and a douchebag strutting in

1351
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:55,415
I wonder if you saw them

1352
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,791
Help us out, will you?

1353
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,707
It's been a while

1354
00:53:58,707 --> 00:53:59,832
Now I see,

1355
00:54:00,124 --> 00:54:01,707
isn't that the douchebag

1356
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:03,457
And that slut must be

1357
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:04,582
Who's looking for me?

1358
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,415
Baby, baby-boo-boo

1359
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:09,290
Michelle, why are you here?

1360
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:11,332
Long time no see

1361
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:12,832
Care to tell me why you

1362
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,957
You-you-you seem exhausted

1363
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:17,373
Were you deprived of a man's love for a long time?

1364
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:21,916
Ma'am, are you blind?

1365
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:24,582
You should see that Michelle
is glowing from within

1366
00:54:24,582 --> 00:54:25,748
Her love fortune is running high

1367
00:54:25,749 --> 00:54:27,624
Who are you?

1368
00:54:27,624 --> 00:54:28,582
I'm nobody

1369
00:54:28,582 --> 00:54:29,457
I'm asking Michelle out

1370
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:31,082
And ended up here

1371
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:33,999
Then, how shall we address you?

1372
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:34,790
Call me Simon

1373
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36,041
Uncle Simon

1374
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:38,457
It's your birthday today, happy birthday

1375
00:54:38,457 --> 00:54:39,123
Thank you

1376
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:40,790
Excuse me for not bringing a present,
I was too hurried

1377
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:42,707
Don't pretend, you just don't care

1378
00:54:43,082 --> 00:54:44,332
It's fine not bringing a present

1379
00:54:44,332 --> 00:54:45,540
We take cash in substitute

1380
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,874
Can't afford a few hundred dollars?

1381
00:54:47,874 --> 00:54:49,332
It would be stingy to talk about money now

1382
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:51,373
It's your birthday

1383
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,457
Do you have any wishes? I'll make them true

1384
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,623
If my baby-boo wants to go to the moon,
could you take her there?

1385
00:54:56,832 --> 00:54:58,207
That's easy

1386
00:54:58,457 --> 00:55:00,915
I booked a rocket trip to go in 2029

1387
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:03,457
If you like, I can give you my seat

1388
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:06,082
But that's more than ten years,
let's talk about sometime closer home

1389
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:08,665
Let me teach you an English idiom today

1390
00:55:09,332 --> 00:55:11,790
"Blow water don't wipe mouth”

1391
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:12,874
What does it mean?

1392
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:14,374
"All mouth and no trousers"

1393
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,249
How about this

1394
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:20,624
My Baby-boo shares her birthday
with the TV station

1395
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:22,749
And it's their anniversary gala tonight

1396
00:55:22,749 --> 00:55:24,124
If you really can

1397
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:27,999
Give my Baby-boo the Gala Prize

1398
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,166
The Gala Prize it is

1399
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:33,207
"Blow water don't wipe mouth", again

1400
00:55:33,207 --> 00:55:35,790
They are just kidding. It's just a joke

1401
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:37,707
Go

1402
00:55:38,457 --> 00:55:41,582
No problem, trust me. I can handle it

1403
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:45,207
Give me your number. The Gala Prize will be yours

1404
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,040
He's so manly

1405
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:49,582
Uncle Simon, my number is

1406
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:51,207
67676767

1407
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:52,916
Remember it

1408
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,457
Excuse me for a second, I need to make a call

1409
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:58,457
You idiot, getting her number like that

1410
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,624
"Boss"

1411
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:03,873
Hello, Boss

1412
00:56:03,874 --> 00:56:05,790
Is it hard to get the TV station's Gala Prize?

1413
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,541
Their hotlines are usually full,
it's difficult to phone in

1414
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:08,957
I want that prize tonight

1415
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,748
It's a birthday gift for someone

1416
00:56:11,082 --> 00:56:12,207
I'll give you a number,

1417
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:13,123
the Prize shall be hers

1418
00:56:13,124 --> 00:56:14,290
Boss, this is not going to be easy

1419
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,082
If it is, I won't be needing you

1420
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,374
Do everything to get it done, that's all

1421
00:56:20,124 --> 00:56:21,499
This is too much

1422
00:56:26,374 --> 00:56:27,832
Stop fanning me,

1423
00:56:27,832 --> 00:56:29,498
go find the director

1424
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:30,624
- Where is my stuntwoman?
- Lily, be smart.

1425
00:56:30,624 --> 00:56:31,624
That girl is troublesome.

1426
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:33,290
Shall we go dancing after work

1427
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:34,832
Who is this?

1428
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:36,332
Martial arts director

1429
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:37,623
Oh, what's the matter?

1430
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:39,457
Who is this?

1431
00:56:39,457 --> 00:56:40,248
The stuntwoman

1432
00:56:40,249 --> 00:56:42,415
For Miss Lok? That is a man

1433
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:44,207
Man? She's a woman

1434
00:56:44,207 --> 00:56:46,832
You're crazy, he's a man

1435
00:56:46,832 --> 00:56:49,332
I am what you call a woman

1436
00:56:49,332 --> 00:56:51,790
Oh, Lily. You didn't shave for work

1437
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:54,041
You asked for a stuntwoman all of a sudden,

1438
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:54,999
you have to live with it

1439
00:56:54,999 --> 00:56:57,040
Hey, if you let that act as my boss

1440
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,374
We will lose face

1441
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,415
I don't care if you don't get off work today

1442
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:05,957
If you don't find a girl as hot as me

1443
00:57:05,957 --> 00:57:07,332
I'm not filming

1444
00:57:07,332 --> 00:57:09,915
Get this solved

1445
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:12,499
I am going to take a dump in the van. Useless shit

1446
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:13,665
Hey... What is this?

1447
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:20,707
Why are you in my van?

1448
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:22,290
- Shut up, don't move! Be still
- Hey, let me go!

1449
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:25,291
- Help! Why are you driving away?
- Don't move! Be still

1450
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:26,957
Help!
"TV Station"

1451
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:28,874
Hey, Patrick

1452
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:30,082
- What?
- New arrangement

1453
00:57:30,082 --> 00:57:31,665
You are going to host the session
for our Gala Prize

1454
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:32,999
Natalie is the one to do game shows

1455
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:35,082
He's got diarrhoea and went home already

1456
00:57:35,082 --> 00:57:35,832
What about Eric?

1457
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:37,373
His driver got into trouble for fighting
at Ian Kwai Fong

1458
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:38,332
He's gone to bail him out

1459
00:57:38,332 --> 00:57:40,373
No way

1460
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,207
Stop complaining, the producer said he wants you

1461
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:43,873
It's your turn after the commercials, get ready

1462
00:57:43,874 --> 00:57:44,624
So fast

1463
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:47,040
Boss, phone call for you

1464
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,207
I'm going live

1465
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:50,415
They say it's very important, you must listen now

1466
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:51,291
Hello

1467
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:52,957
15

1468
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:55,332
That's me

1469
00:57:55,332 --> 00:57:56,498
Next is your turn

1470
00:57:56,499 --> 00:57:58,749
Man, stop trying to act cool

1471
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,291
If you can't deliver

1472
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,166
Just say it

1473
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,374
What if I can? What will you do?

1474
00:58:02,374 --> 00:58:04,290
If you can make the TV station call us

1475
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,332
I can do anything

1476
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:07,957
If I don't, I shall get killed in a car crash

1477
00:58:07,957 --> 00:58:09,082
Choke on ice-cream to death

1478
00:58:09,082 --> 00:58:09,748
And even

1479
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:10,707
Have my penis rot

1480
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,791
Enough talk, let's switch on the TV

1481
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:16,374
Welcome all to our most
exciting part of the show

1482
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:18,790
Gala Prize Reveal

1483
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:23,082
I will randomly pick out
one of our audiences at home

1484
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,832
My Baby-boo did not enter for the lucky draw

1485
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:27,123
Nor does she know the code

1486
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:29,499
How could Patrick Dunn call us

1487
00:58:31,332 --> 00:58:32,582
Just give up

1488
00:58:33,249 --> 00:58:35,332
Since we're here, we'll see what happens

1489
00:58:35,332 --> 00:58:37,498
May I introduce a special guest

1490
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:39,957
Who, supposedly, should be in Beijing

1491
00:58:39,957 --> 00:58:41,248
But because of our prize-giving ceremony

1492
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:44,041
That's him, MC Jin

1493
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,499
I came back to Hong Kong
to play games with you all

1494
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:49,165
We are live now, on live

1495
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:52,166
For the sake of impartiality, we also invited

1496
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:55,166
Patty Wong Accountants
to monitor the entire process

1497
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,082
Welcome, Patty Wong

1498
00:58:57,082 --> 00:59:00,082
So now, who will become our
lucky audience? You must be nervous too

1499
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,082
- Let me do it, let me do it
- No need

1500
00:59:05,582 --> 00:59:07,332
Special guests don't have to do anything

1501
00:59:07,332 --> 00:59:09,748
Okay, let's see

1502
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:14,749
Hello, our dear audience. It's through

1503
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:16,123
Hello

1504
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:16,874
Who are you?

1505
00:59:16,874 --> 00:59:18,540
I'm Chan, I'm so happy

1506
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:19,749
We got bad reception here. Hello, hello

1507
00:59:19,749 --> 00:59:20,790
Everything is fine here

1508
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,082
Oh no, it got cut,

1509
00:59:23,624 --> 00:59:25,540
better luck next time

1510
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:28,249
But we can draw another of our audience at home

1511
00:59:28,249 --> 00:59:30,082
Mr. Patty Wong, please

1512
00:59:31,249 --> 00:59:32,874
Get me another number

1513
00:59:32,874 --> 00:59:33,665
Yes

1514
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:37,582
Let me do this, let me do this

1515
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:40,082
Special guests don't have to do anything

1516
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:43,291
Let's see if this one

1517
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:45,290
Is sitting by the TV

1518
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,832
Hello, who are you?

1519
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:48,790
My surname is Cheung

1520
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:50,707
Mr. Cheung, are you watching us on TV?

1521
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:51,332
Yes, yes

1522
00:59:51,332 --> 00:59:52,248
I'm going to ask you a question now

1523
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:56,707
I'm going to ask.
Hello Mr. Cheung, can you hear...

1524
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:59,124
Oh, hit or miss, just like this

1525
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,666
He's gone, again

1526
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,749
Patty Wong, the number

1527
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:07,124
You hung up on all the calls, MC

1528
01:00:07,124 --> 01:00:08,290
There are no numbers left

1529
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:09,874
We aren't like this usually

1530
01:00:09,874 --> 01:00:11,582
Not sure why all calls got hung up

1531
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:12,582
Wait

1532
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:17,457
Hello, my boss? It is I, your employee

1533
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:20,082
Yes, sure, I see, I understand, okay

1534
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:23,999
My boss says,
he'll give you one more number to call

1535
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:27,249
If it doesn't succeed,
the prize will have to wait until next year

1536
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,749
Then, what's the number?

1537
01:00:28,749 --> 01:00:32,207
Come on, get it done already.
I'm in a hurry to mahjong and dinner

1538
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:35,248
I stand here every year looking at you make calls

1539
01:00:35,249 --> 01:00:36,665
And I don't get to share

1540
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,457
I'm not coming next year

1541
01:00:38,457 --> 01:00:42,957
Okay, okay, I'm right at it, I'll call randomly

1542
01:00:55,457 --> 01:00:56,332
Pick up, pick up

1543
01:00:57,582 --> 01:00:58,582
Pick up

1544
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:01,790
Hello

1545
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:02,707
Hello

1546
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,915
Who are you?

1547
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:08,957
A... Anna

1548
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,332
Anna, you must be watching TV

1549
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:15,916
Patrick Dunn called me on TV

1550
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:19,582
Anna Anna

1551
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:21,082
I'm here, I'm here...

1552
01:01:21,082 --> 01:01:23,207
Your prize is worth $990,000,

1553
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:24,873
and it depends whether
you can answer this correctly

1554
01:01:24,874 --> 01:01:25,582
I see

1555
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:27,373
Listen carefully. The question is:

1556
01:01:27,374 --> 01:01:29,290
Are you male or female?

1557
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:34,998
Anna

1558
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:39,498
Female

1559
01:01:39,499 --> 01:01:41,165
Wow, accurate with speed

1560
01:01:42,124 --> 01:01:45,082
Congratulations Anna, the prize is yours

1561
01:01:45,082 --> 01:01:47,540
You will be contacted about collection details

1562
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:48,707
Congratulations Anna,

1563
01:01:48,707 --> 01:01:50,457
We have given out all our prizes tonight

1564
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,582
Thank you all for tuning in to our Anniversary Gala

1565
01:01:52,582 --> 01:01:55,748
We will see you next year, good-bye

1566
01:01:58,499 --> 01:02:00,332
Let's go for mahjong

1567
01:02:01,957 --> 01:02:03,582
Let's get started with the show

1568
01:02:03,582 --> 01:02:05,082
Hey, you lazy Patrick Dunn

1569
01:02:05,082 --> 01:02:07,082
You called it a day as if things are done

1570
01:02:07,082 --> 01:02:09,290
My freestyle is legit,

1571
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:10,624
Who's that?

1572
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:12,373
Still rapping?

1573
01:02:12,374 --> 01:02:14,999
- Yo, do you think I have much time to spare?
- Stop rapping!

1574
01:02:15,374 --> 01:02:17,415
Shut the lights and bring the dogs out

1575
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,707
Let him rap all he wants

1576
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:21,874
It's not okay, I don't feel dismayed

1577
01:02:21,874 --> 01:02:24,165
My freestyle game, it's staying so strong

1578
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:27,082
I said make some noise if you love Hong Kong

1579
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,957
I did everything you told me to

1580
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:35,040
Release her

1581
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,832
She is just beside the van

1582
01:02:42,707 --> 01:02:43,873
Why did this happen?

1583
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:45,957
Get up, stand up first

1584
01:02:46,249 --> 01:02:47,165
It's impossible,

1585
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:49,082
no one knows about our relationship

1586
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:51,874
Did they harm you?

1587
01:02:51,874 --> 01:02:53,749
If this counts as harming

1588
01:02:53,749 --> 01:02:56,499
I wish they could do it again and again to me

1589
01:02:56,499 --> 01:02:58,624
I really enjoyed it

1590
01:03:02,707 --> 01:03:05,707
They said all of this is for me

1591
01:03:05,707 --> 01:03:07,832
I want to have half of it

1592
01:03:16,332 --> 01:03:18,540
Cheers

1593
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,041
Congratulations

1594
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:22,457
My voice was on TV

1595
01:03:22,457 --> 01:03:26,082
Patrick Dunn spoke to me

1596
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:27,082
Lo Jok

1597
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:29,873
You said if you lost, you would do anything

1598
01:03:30,124 --> 01:03:31,832
Don't act like you forgot

1599
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:33,874
Why would I do that?

1600
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:36,123
Here! I'll drink up three cups

1601
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:37,624
No one told you to drink

1602
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:42,999
Read it

1603
01:03:49,624 --> 01:03:50,415
Out loud

1604
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:56,415
You are not a horse

1605
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,416
What is wrong with you?

1606
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:02,499
Have you gone mute? Read it now

1607
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:05,540
Read it, or else you will
choke on ice-cream to death

1608
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,374
Get killed in a car crash

1609
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:08,957
Your penis will rot

1610
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,665
Michelle, I am a jerk

1611
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,541
I hooked up with your best friend,
I am sorry! Michelle

1612
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:19,082
I am a jerk. I hooked up with your best friend,

1613
01:04:19,082 --> 01:04:20,040
I am sorry! Michelle

1614
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:21,707
I am a jerk, I took your money
and hooked up with your best friend

1615
01:04:21,707 --> 01:04:23,123
I am sorry! Michelle. I am a jerk,

1616
01:04:23,124 --> 01:04:24,999
I took your money
and hooked up with your best friend

1617
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:26,124
I am sorry! Michelle

1618
01:04:26,499 --> 01:04:29,415
Okay, okay, okay... Are you done?

1619
01:04:29,874 --> 01:04:31,749
It says here for me to repeat 100 times

1620
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:33,582
I fear that if I don't

1621
01:04:34,457 --> 01:04:35,832
I will rot down there

1622
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,582
So you are not afraid that I won't forgive you

1623
01:04:41,999 --> 01:04:43,082
Well...

1624
01:04:44,249 --> 01:04:45,249
Will you forgive me?

1625
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:46,124
No

1626
01:04:46,707 --> 01:04:49,165
Because you are not worthy to be
in my heart to begin with

1627
01:04:50,082 --> 01:04:51,665
From tonight onwards

1628
01:04:51,957 --> 01:04:54,498
I will forget you completely

1629
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:01,749
Stop it,

1630
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:03,957
play with your toys

1631
01:05:03,957 --> 01:05:06,082
Stop playing with my hair,
do you understand?

1632
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:07,373
It takes me ages to do my hair

1633
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:09,582
Hey, looks like you are having fun

1634
01:05:09,582 --> 01:05:10,915
Nice. Kiki

1635
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:12,540
Mommy will go out for dinner today.

1636
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,791
Funny, you take care of Kiki

1637
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:17,082
No, that's not it, boss. No

1638
01:05:17,624 --> 01:05:18,624
I'm good at getting girls,

1639
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,249
but not looking after them

1640
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,082
I'm no good

1641
01:05:21,082 --> 01:05:23,457
You used to say that you have a big heart

1642
01:05:23,457 --> 01:05:25,082
Now is the time for you to demonstrate that

1643
01:05:25,082 --> 01:05:27,707
My daughter is a good girl

1644
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,166
- Thank you
- No, she is...

1645
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:31,374
Mommy, Mommy, let me open

1646
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:34,957
Yucky

1647
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:38,082
Kiki, don't say the truth out loud

1648
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:39,498
Mommy knows her

1649
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,499
Dr. Bo, this is bad

1650
01:05:41,499 --> 01:05:42,374
What's the matter?

1651
01:05:42,374 --> 01:05:44,540
My boss is losing and going bankrupt.
Please go and see him

1652
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,291
Big sister, candy for you

1653
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:49,457
Miss, no candy for her

1654
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:50,790
Give her something nasty

1655
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,999
I made the candy with my boogers

1656
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,291
Dr. Bo, this time it is really serious, four words

1657
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:57,916
Like a sinking ship

1658
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:06,873
Wasn't it "like a sinking ship"?

1659
01:06:06,874 --> 01:06:09,624
You moron, you said your boss is nearly bankrupt

1660
01:06:09,624 --> 01:06:11,040
No one's gambling here, you tricked us

1661
01:06:11,457 --> 01:06:12,707
Not that no one's gambling

1662
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,248
Just not yet

1663
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:16,499
My goddess, it's been three months,

1664
01:06:16,499 --> 01:06:18,124
I missed you

1665
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:24,791
Philip, what do you want

1666
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:25,874
Nothing much,

1667
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:28,749
I'm waiting especially for you tonight

1668
01:06:28,749 --> 01:06:30,457
And I invited my good old pal to gamble with you

1669
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:32,582
That's crazy, you have your say either way

1670
01:06:32,874 --> 01:06:33,790
Boss, let's leave

1671
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,291
How? We'll play by the rules

1672
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:38,499
If she wins, I quit gambling for three months

1673
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:41,665
That doesn't mean
I can't let someone play in my place

1674
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,332
to make me lose

1675
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,957
My goddess, I hope you aren't quitting now?

1676
01:06:46,957 --> 01:06:48,665
Your shifting standards are insufferable

1677
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:49,582
Let's go, boss

1678
01:06:49,582 --> 01:06:50,582
You fat ass

1679
01:06:50,582 --> 01:06:51,873
I've put up with you long enough

1680
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,415
Since when is it your turn to speak?

1681
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,207
Now that we are here, let's do it

1682
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:57,457
That's my goddess, bold and fearless

1683
01:06:57,457 --> 01:06:59,415
A big welcome to my good friend,

1684
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,666
King of Cheats, Brother Tse

1685
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:08,957
Isn't it too dark for shades?

1686
01:07:09,707 --> 01:07:11,165
His hair looks dry

1687
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:20,166
Are we getting on? I'm a busy man

1688
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:22,290
Don't waste the old man's time

1689
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:23,207
Okay, deal the cards

1690
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:24,498
My goddess always speaks

1691
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,124
with such mighty aura

1692
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:27,332
Deal the cards

1693
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:29,165
Hey, what is she doing here?

1694
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:29,999
She is not a dealer

1695
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:31,415
Are you referring to May last time

1696
01:07:31,707 --> 01:07:34,623
Sorry, I sent her to Heilongjiang

1697
01:07:34,624 --> 01:07:37,249
Those who go against me will never end well

1698
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:40,249
Dr. Bo

1699
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:41,916
You had help last time

1700
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,291
This time things won't go so well

1701
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:46,582
If you lose this time,
it will be more than having midnight snacks

1702
01:07:46,582 --> 01:07:48,082
The night goes on

1703
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:50,041
If I won this game

1704
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,624
You shall also quit for the rest of your life

1705
01:07:52,207 --> 01:07:53,915
And never see me ever again

1706
01:07:54,832 --> 01:07:55,832
Impossible

1707
01:07:56,624 --> 01:07:58,415
I have the King of Cheats to assist me

1708
01:07:58,416 --> 01:07:59,957
What's to fear? Deal the cards

1709
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:06,415
Lady, let me help you

1710
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:24,123
Let me do it, let me do it

1711
01:08:24,124 --> 01:08:24,957
Can you?

1712
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:26,707
I can try

1713
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:52,290
Little girl, you are very talented

1714
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:54,124
Why don't you be my student?

1715
01:08:54,124 --> 01:08:56,374
You be my student instead,

1716
01:08:56,374 --> 01:08:58,040
and I give you candy

1717
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,166
Good stuff

1718
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:01,457
Dr. Bo, what's are we betting?

1719
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:03,123
One card each, the bigger one wins

1720
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:04,624
Good

1721
01:09:06,999 --> 01:09:08,165
Ladies first

1722
01:09:08,457 --> 01:09:09,623
Kiki

1723
01:09:09,624 --> 01:09:10,957
Take one for mommy

1724
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:13,415
No, you let her? She's retarded

1725
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,207
What's the problem? She is my daughter

1726
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:16,082
Who else should I ask? You?

1727
01:09:16,082 --> 01:09:17,207
You are right

1728
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:28,082
Don't look yet

1729
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:28,915
Wait

1730
01:09:33,999 --> 01:09:35,540
I win

1731
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:36,916
Tell Fatty to get my yacht here

1732
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:39,291
I will have fun with my goddess out in the sea

1733
01:09:41,874 --> 01:09:42,707
Oh,

1734
01:09:42,957 --> 01:09:46,498
Brother Tse, why is your card the same as mine?

1735
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:49,915
No way

1736
01:09:52,499 --> 01:09:53,249
Hey,

1737
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:55,082
we are playing from a blue deck

1738
01:09:55,082 --> 01:09:56,707
Why is yours a red card?

1739
01:09:56,707 --> 01:09:58,248
Your cheating is going too far

1740
01:09:58,249 --> 01:09:59,624
The kid must have changed our cards

1741
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:00,457
You are crazy

1742
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:02,457
You can see that she is retarded,
how could she do it?

1743
01:10:02,457 --> 01:10:04,082
- Being retarded doesn't mean she can't cheat
- Of course not

1744
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:05,040
- Of course
- Of course not

1745
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:06,457
Stop arguing.

1746
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:09,124
It is pretty clear who won and who lost

1747
01:10:09,374 --> 01:10:11,207
Philip, you promised me

1748
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,748
You will not gamble ever again

1749
01:10:14,332 --> 01:10:16,290
Thank you, godfather

1750
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,249
Godfather? You are familiar with him?
And you kissed

1751
01:10:18,249 --> 01:10:19,374
Drinks on me tonight

1752
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:21,082
Godfather

1753
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:22,457
Stop talking about drinks

1754
01:10:22,457 --> 01:10:23,290
Explain this to me

1755
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:25,416
You invited him over to defeat me

1756
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:27,499
But he can make himself lose, too

1757
01:10:27,499 --> 01:10:29,499
You try to switch up the goal

1758
01:10:29,499 --> 01:10:31,540
But I also have a goalkeeper behind my back

1759
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:32,624
Philip

1760
01:10:32,624 --> 01:10:35,082
You can't force love to happen

1761
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:36,999
I'm leaving

1762
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:38,207
My Goddess...

1763
01:10:39,582 --> 01:10:40,873
- Good boy
- What

1764
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:42,124
I give you candy

1765
01:10:42,124 --> 01:10:43,957
- King of Cheats,
- This is good stuff

1766
01:10:43,957 --> 01:10:45,582
How do you style your hair

1767
01:10:51,249 --> 01:10:52,540
Made up your mind about dinner yet?

1768
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:57,832
Are you thinking about how to thank me?

1769
01:10:57,832 --> 01:10:59,498
Don't bother, it's no big deal

1770
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:01,541
I want to tell you something

1771
01:11:02,457 --> 01:11:03,665
You want to pledge your life to me?

1772
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:05,916
How did you know? I want to marry you

1773
01:11:07,749 --> 01:11:09,665
I don't think I can ever meet someone

1774
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:11,207
As handsome, cool

1775
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:12,665
and as powerful as you

1776
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:15,207
And you are not young anymore, right?

1777
01:11:15,207 --> 01:11:17,040
Let's not waste our time and get married

1778
01:11:23,374 --> 01:11:24,290
I'm impressed

1779
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,749
I've been out there for a long time.

1780
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,124
No one could ever guess what I want to do

1781
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,541
But you got me there

1782
01:11:32,499 --> 01:11:34,582
I never thought you would propose

1783
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:35,999
Very nice

1784
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:36,790
It's fun

1785
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:37,624
Wonderful

1786
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:41,124
I'm not playing games, I'm serious

1787
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:43,540
I need to fight for my own happiness, right?

1788
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:47,082
Unless you tell me that
you have no feelings for me at all

1789
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:59,291
You really have no feelings for me at all

1790
01:12:01,874 --> 01:12:04,790
I'm sorry, I must have shocked you

1791
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:08,082
I'm not having dinner, I'll get going

1792
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,916
If we are getting married
without seeing your parents first

1793
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,124
It doesn't feel right

1794
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,832
You just need to meet my mum

1795
01:12:22,832 --> 01:12:24,373
She is really nice, she's going to like you

1796
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:25,790
Call her and invite her for lunch

1797
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:26,874
Okay, I'll call her

1798
01:12:28,957 --> 01:12:30,373
Let's have dinner first, I'm hungry

1799
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:34,999
My mum is a nice person. You don't have fear her

1800
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:38,623
Here's you tea

1801
01:12:38,999 --> 01:12:41,540
Is there something you need to tell me?

1802
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:45,041
You are really good at this. How do you know?

1803
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,749
What does your mother do for a living?

1804
01:12:47,249 --> 01:12:47,957
So what is it?

1805
01:12:48,749 --> 01:12:49,999
Got dumped again?

1806
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:51,874
Hold it, hold it, hold it

1807
01:12:51,874 --> 01:12:52,957
Of course not

1808
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:56,499
Don't you tell me you are pregnant

1809
01:12:56,499 --> 01:12:58,957
I don't want to be a grandma soon

1810
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:01,498
That's not it

1811
01:13:01,499 --> 01:13:02,457
That's good

1812
01:13:03,374 --> 01:13:04,249
I'm getting married

1813
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:08,374
To who?

1814
01:13:08,374 --> 01:13:09,332
Who is that person?

1815
01:13:09,332 --> 01:13:10,665
How long have you met?

1816
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:11,666
How did you meet?

1817
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:12,999
Is he trustworthy?

1818
01:13:12,999 --> 01:13:15,082
- Why do you want to get married so suddenly?
- Calm down, calm down

1819
01:13:15,082 --> 01:13:16,707
I asked him to come and see you

1820
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,582
And you didn't tell me beforehand

1821
01:13:19,582 --> 01:13:21,415
Surprise! He is here

1822
01:13:21,749 --> 01:13:23,374
Boss, they are here already

1823
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:34,207
I had a meeting and it ended late

1824
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,915
It's alright

1825
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:36,457
My mother, Dr. Bo

1826
01:13:36,457 --> 01:13:37,832
My boyfriend, Simon Leung

1827
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:39,957
Hello, Mr. Leung

1828
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:41,749
Nice to meet you, Auntie

1829
01:13:42,457 --> 01:13:43,332
Have a seat

1830
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,541
I'm hungry, shall we make an order first?

1831
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:46,332
Sure

1832
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:47,624
What do you want, Mummy?

1833
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:50,166
Why don't you ask Mr. Leung, see what he likes

1834
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,249
I am fine with anything

1835
01:13:51,582 --> 01:13:53,332
Auntie Bo, please have anything you like

1836
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:55,748
- Then I'll decide
- OK

1837
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:08,707
Mr. Leung

1838
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,707
What did you see in Michelle that you like?

1839
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:13,915
Mum, don't say it like I'm an old spinster

1840
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,957
That's not what I mean

1841
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:18,873
I mean, Michelle is a nice, beautiful girl

1842
01:14:18,874 --> 01:14:20,957
Why do have such an eye for good girls?

1843
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,790
Probably because those I met in the past
were all bad women

1844
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:25,999
Now I found a nice girl

1845
01:14:25,999 --> 01:14:27,207
So I'm not going to let go

1846
01:14:27,749 --> 01:14:29,040
You had bad experiences in the past

1847
01:14:29,582 --> 01:14:30,790
I never heard you talk about it

1848
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:33,332
It's better to let bygones be bygones

1849
01:14:33,874 --> 01:14:35,665
As long as I am happy now

1850
01:14:36,957 --> 01:14:38,165
Sometimes,

1851
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:40,332
one believed that they encountered bad people

1852
01:14:40,332 --> 01:14:41,790
But never considers the bad things

1853
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,707
that they have done

1854
01:14:44,582 --> 01:14:45,373
Auntie,

1855
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,749
for so many years

1856
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,666
You had to bring up two daughters all on your own.

1857
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:50,040
Was is difficult for you?

1858
01:14:50,832 --> 01:14:53,165
Ever thought of finding a good man
to take care of you?

1859
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:55,832
Mummy has many admirers

1860
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,874
Yin, go home in my car today

1861
01:14:58,124 --> 01:14:58,874
Is that so?

1862
01:14:58,999 --> 01:15:01,915
You are very demanding, and you look down on men

1863
01:15:02,124 --> 01:15:03,707
What sort of men do you like, I wonder?

1864
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:06,124
Honestly, my requirements are simple

1865
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:08,582
Being honest is most important

1866
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:10,541
Simon is very honest

1867
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:13,416
So you are not against us, are you?

1868
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:16,707
Of course I don't.
What's important is what you like

1869
01:15:16,957 --> 01:15:18,165
Thank you Mummy

1870
01:15:18,624 --> 01:15:19,832
Say thank you

1871
01:15:20,832 --> 01:15:21,540
Thanks, Auntie

1872
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,749
Am I still "Auntie"?

1873
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:25,290
You should address me like Michelle did

1874
01:15:29,582 --> 01:15:30,540
Come on

1875
01:15:32,082 --> 01:15:32,873
Thanks, Mummy

1876
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,541
That's more like it.

1877
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:35,916
Have some food

1878
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:36,832
Here

1879
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:44,874
I never thought Mum would like you that much

1880
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:45,874
You don't have confidence in me?

1881
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,540
For my other boyfriends

1882
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,249
She didn't like them much

1883
01:15:49,707 --> 01:15:52,373
But she had no negative comments about you

1884
01:15:52,374 --> 01:15:53,499
One word, "excellent"

1885
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,332
I don't have any flaws for her to pick on

1886
01:15:57,249 --> 01:15:58,415
You're so conceited

1887
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:40,166
"After tonight, let's meet and talk"

1888
01:16:53,124 --> 01:16:55,290
"The usual place, I'll wait for you"

1889
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:31,707
What do you want, pretty?

1890
01:17:31,707 --> 01:17:34,207
Lard dregs noodles, little spicy, more vegetables

1891
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:35,707
And you, handsome?

1892
01:17:35,707 --> 01:17:38,165
Lard dregs noodles, very spicy, no vegetables

1893
01:17:38,624 --> 01:17:40,749
What a unison. You practiced at home?

1894
01:17:41,374 --> 01:17:42,790
Food will be ready in no time

1895
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,832
Here's some juice for free

1896
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,540
It's been a while. You've lost weight

1897
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:54,957
It's nothing, I'm getting on alright

1898
01:17:54,957 --> 01:17:56,415
I heard you are getting married

1899
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:57,332
Yes

1900
01:17:57,332 --> 01:17:59,165
And you are still by yourself after these years

1901
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:01,124
Are you really in love with my daughter

1902
01:18:01,124 --> 01:18:02,499
If you aren't, don't hurt her

1903
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,832
She is a very simple girl

1904
01:18:05,374 --> 01:18:07,082
Why do you think I will harm her?

1905
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:09,249
You know I'm not that kind of person

1906
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:11,290
Because I know you too well

1907
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,791
You like to cheat

1908
01:18:12,791 --> 01:18:13,916
Don't you remember?

1909
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:16,249
You even went after my best friend

1910
01:18:16,249 --> 01:18:18,040
Why don't you believe in anything I say?

1911
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,999
Your friend seduced me

1912
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:22,499
But you still had to accept it

1913
01:18:23,374 --> 01:18:24,749
If you know me

1914
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:27,999
You will believe that I did nothing at that time

1915
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,874
Let's leave it, it happened so long ago,
nothing matters now

1916
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,124
Isn't that so?

1917
01:18:34,082 --> 01:18:36,790
You men like to put the blame on others

1918
01:18:37,374 --> 01:18:39,540
And never admit what you did. And when you do

1919
01:18:39,874 --> 01:18:41,415
That's because someone was wrong in the first place

1920
01:18:41,749 --> 01:18:42,665
You did something wrong too

1921
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:43,791
What?

1922
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:45,499
You despised me for being poor

1923
01:18:45,832 --> 01:18:49,457
You thought I had no future,
so you went for someone else

1924
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:51,290
I never said that,

1925
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:52,749
you just saw me that way

1926
01:18:52,749 --> 01:18:55,082
You didn't say it but it showed on your face

1927
01:18:55,082 --> 01:18:56,957
Everyone knew you went after Alex

1928
01:18:56,957 --> 01:18:58,498
You had an affair

1929
01:18:58,499 --> 01:19:00,999
I said I did not, don't accuse me of that

1930
01:19:00,999 --> 01:19:02,415
But God is watching.

1931
01:19:02,416 --> 01:19:04,416
Alex got married last year,

1932
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:06,207
and you are not his bride

1933
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:08,291
As for me, I'm getting married soon

1934
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:10,791
And my wife is very young

1935
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:13,291
If you were lucky, you could have been her mother

1936
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,374
Are you done speaking?

1937
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:17,082
No, I came here especially to see you

1938
01:19:17,082 --> 01:19:18,498
To see how down-trodden you are

1939
01:19:18,499 --> 01:19:20,249
You are not young, fix yourself up

1940
01:19:20,249 --> 01:19:23,915
Or else no one will want you

1941
01:19:25,457 --> 01:19:27,248
Hey you, stay there

1942
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:31,707
Young boys and girls nowadays
are really quick-tempered

1943
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,249
We were like that too

1944
01:19:40,957 --> 01:19:41,748
Do you still remember?

1945
01:19:43,749 --> 01:19:46,790
That corner has never changed in decades

1946
01:19:48,249 --> 01:19:49,874
That broken brick is still there

1947
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:52,207
I did that for you

1948
01:19:52,207 --> 01:19:53,582
Let's say you were violent

1949
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:54,665
What violent?

1950
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,040
That guy with glasses was harassing you

1951
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,207
Don't hit me

1952
01:20:01,582 --> 01:20:02,332
Apologize to her

1953
01:20:02,332 --> 01:20:03,540
Sorry, boss

1954
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:05,707
Let's go, you'll kill him. You're so violent

1955
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:07,540
Violent? This is all for you

1956
01:20:08,124 --> 01:20:09,332
No one meddles with my girl

1957
01:20:11,332 --> 01:20:14,582
I think you had mood disorders back then already

1958
01:20:14,582 --> 01:20:15,415
What disorder?

1959
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:17,666
Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?

1960
01:20:17,999 --> 01:20:20,624
Why don't you come to me, I'll give you a discount

1961
01:20:20,624 --> 01:20:22,290
You are so ungrateful

1962
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:24,041
I fought for you

1963
01:20:25,499 --> 01:20:28,624
Hey, bro, you look familiar

1964
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:29,499
I don't know you

1965
01:20:29,499 --> 01:20:30,457
Who are you?

1966
01:20:30,457 --> 01:20:34,457
I'm that guy with glasses
that you beat up in the past

1967
01:20:34,457 --> 01:20:35,707
I'm sorry, bro

1968
01:20:35,707 --> 01:20:38,540
For twenty years I come here every night

1969
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:40,416
To see if I can see you again

1970
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:42,457
I even got the bosslady here

1971
01:20:42,832 --> 01:20:44,957
Just to see you again

1972
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:45,873
What a coincidence

1973
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,624
Exactly

1974
01:20:47,624 --> 01:20:48,499
Guys

1975
01:20:49,207 --> 01:20:50,207
Go and get him

1976
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,916
Don't run, don't run...

1977
01:22:19,374 --> 01:22:20,999
Why have you kept the pager?

1978
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:22,916
You too

1979
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:25,916
You never contacted me

1980
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:26,874
You too

1981
01:22:27,332 --> 01:22:28,873
How do you know it still works?

1982
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:30,832
I asked the telecommunications company

1983
01:22:31,332 --> 01:22:32,582
As long as you pay,

1984
01:22:32,582 --> 01:22:35,290
they cannot cancel your number

1985
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:37,332
Don't you know that?

1986
01:22:38,249 --> 01:22:39,957
In order for the pager to keep working

1987
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,624
I bought the whole telecommunications company

1988
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,582
Like an overnight billionaire

1989
01:22:45,124 --> 01:22:46,540
You splurge whenever you got money.

1990
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,624
Vulgar tycoon

1991
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:53,291
I have lots of money

1992
01:22:54,082 --> 01:22:55,457
If it is for the woman I love

1993
01:22:55,999 --> 01:22:57,207
I think it is worth it

1994
01:22:57,957 --> 01:22:59,040
What you do like?

1995
01:22:59,832 --> 01:23:00,832
I can buy it for you

1996
01:23:02,707 --> 01:23:05,040
I never despised you for being poor

1997
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:08,332
You know what you did

1998
01:23:09,832 --> 01:23:11,165
I just didn't like how went around

1999
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:13,624
and manipulate people with money

2000
01:23:13,624 --> 01:23:15,749
I want to tell you that

2001
01:23:15,749 --> 01:23:18,040
Money doesn't solve all your problems

2002
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:23,249
I didn't know Michelle is your daughter

2003
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:25,874
Now that you know, then what?

2004
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:29,624
Don't even think about it

2005
01:23:33,124 --> 01:23:34,415
Cheers, son-in-law

2006
01:23:42,082 --> 01:23:44,165
Treat Michelle well

2007
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:46,666
Or else I will not let you have it easy

2008
01:23:48,207 --> 01:23:48,915
Bo,

2009
01:23:50,332 --> 01:23:51,915
you missed me all along

2010
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:54,499
Do you really want to know?

2011
01:23:54,624 --> 01:23:55,457
Yes

2012
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:58,499
I will not tell you

2013
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:07,082
Do you know what's the difference
between a man and a woman?

2014
01:24:07,874 --> 01:24:08,749
Tell me

2015
01:24:10,082 --> 01:24:11,665
Men is like bluetooth

2016
01:24:12,957 --> 01:24:15,832
If his woman is nearby, he sticks to her

2017
01:24:16,582 --> 01:24:18,123
If she's gone

2018
01:24:18,332 --> 01:24:20,498
He will go and connect with another woman

2019
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:24,041
Women are different, they are like Wifi

2020
01:24:24,457 --> 01:24:27,748
Even if she has many
available connections around her

2021
01:24:27,749 --> 01:24:29,707
She will only connect to the strongest one

2022
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:32,999
Then she latches onto him, and will never change

2023
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:36,541
You men fall in love with women one after another

2024
01:24:37,249 --> 01:24:38,874
How can I believe you?

2025
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:07,999
Hello

2026
01:25:07,999 --> 01:25:08,999
Where are you?

2027
01:25:10,832 --> 01:25:11,915
In a meeting

2028
01:25:11,999 --> 01:25:12,832
Did I interrupt you?

2029
01:25:13,749 --> 01:25:14,540
No.

2030
01:25:15,749 --> 01:25:16,624
Not going to sleep yet?

2031
01:25:16,624 --> 01:25:18,624
Nearly, take your time then

2032
01:25:18,624 --> 01:25:20,582
I'll sleep now. Good-bye

2033
01:25:22,957 --> 01:25:23,707
It's Michelle

2034
01:25:38,082 --> 01:25:38,832
Michelle?

2035
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:41,582
Mummy, there is something I want to ask you

2036
01:25:41,999 --> 01:25:42,915
What?

2037
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:45,874
Can we invite Simon over for
Chinese New Year's Eve dinner?

2038
01:25:46,332 --> 01:25:47,415
Of course

2039
01:25:48,082 --> 01:25:50,832
Sure, we are a family

2040
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:51,999
Thank you Mummy

2041
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:53,415
Sleep early

2042
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:55,499
You too, goodnight

2043
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:56,665
Goodnight

2044
01:26:02,374 --> 01:26:04,624
Michelle asks me to invite you over for dinner

2045
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:07,040
Be early this time

2046
01:26:07,624 --> 01:26:08,415
Thank you

2047
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:10,248
What happened in the past,

2048
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:12,207
let it stay in the past

2049
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:19,207
I think this is my last time meeting you privately

2050
01:26:21,457 --> 01:26:22,540
Take care

2051
01:26:41,874 --> 01:26:43,040
He's not picking up

2052
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:48,624
He isn't like this usually

2053
01:26:48,624 --> 01:26:50,624
I think he must be in a meeting

2054
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:52,207
Let me call him again

2055
01:26:53,874 --> 01:26:55,207
Michelle

2056
01:26:55,207 --> 01:26:56,623
Don't be so nervous,

2057
01:26:56,624 --> 01:26:58,457
he might just be caught in the traffic

2058
01:26:58,457 --> 01:26:59,582
Sit down

2059
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:01,332
Oh, he is here

2060
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:05,166
- Simon
- I'm sorry,

2061
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:06,416
there's traffic everywhere

2062
01:27:06,416 --> 01:27:08,082
I was worried

2063
01:27:08,082 --> 01:27:09,957
Mum, see how much thought he put in?

2064
01:27:09,957 --> 01:27:11,498
You got this wine?

2065
01:27:11,499 --> 01:27:12,415
Thank you

2066
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:13,124
Don't mention it

2067
01:27:13,124 --> 01:27:14,082
Yes...

2068
01:27:14,082 --> 01:27:15,832
- thank you
- You scared me for being so late

2069
01:27:15,832 --> 01:27:18,165
The first time you come for dinner,

2070
01:27:18,374 --> 01:27:18,874
minus points for you

2071
01:27:18,874 --> 01:27:19,499
Sorry

2072
01:27:19,499 --> 01:27:20,540
Are you hungry?

2073
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:21,707
Eat

2074
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:24,624
Happy New Year

2075
01:27:24,624 --> 01:27:25,957
Happy New Year,

2076
01:27:25,957 --> 01:27:29,165
wish you good health and good fortune

2077
01:27:32,416 --> 01:27:33,916
<i>Simon, aren't you eating?</i>

2078
01:27:35,249 --> 01:27:36,874
Michelle likes the drumstick

2079
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,041
Thank you

2080
01:27:41,707 --> 01:27:44,332
Auntie, I think you also like drumsticks

2081
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:45,749
Thank you

2082
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,166
I also like drumstick

2083
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:49,915
Mummy will give it to Kiki

2084
01:27:50,624 --> 01:27:51,499
Good

2085
01:27:51,582 --> 01:27:53,040
Mummy is good, Kiki is a good girl too

2086
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:57,499
As a mother, I should let my daughter have her way

2087
01:28:01,874 --> 01:28:04,124
Since we have everyone here,
I have something to announce

2088
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:06,082
Really? Me too

2089
01:28:06,249 --> 01:28:08,124
What's with that? You agreed on this?

2090
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:09,666
If you don't mind,

2091
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:11,082
let me announce first

2092
01:28:11,082 --> 01:28:11,957
You go first

2093
01:28:12,124 --> 01:28:14,082
I accepted an offer from a university in the US

2094
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:15,540
To be their guest lecturer,

2095
01:28:16,332 --> 01:28:17,457
I'll leave next week

2096
01:28:17,457 --> 01:28:18,873
So sudden?

2097
01:28:18,874 --> 01:28:19,915
For how long?

2098
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:20,874
At least one year

2099
01:28:20,874 --> 01:28:21,790
That's a long time

2100
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:23,874
Mummy, what about your clinic?

2101
01:28:23,874 --> 01:28:25,790
And your patients? Plus

2102
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:27,207
Sis is stuck in this condition

2103
01:28:27,207 --> 01:28:29,790
The reason I'm going to America, is also to

2104
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:32,957
Research on Kiki's condition with
medical experts over there

2105
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:34,624
When things gets settled

2106
01:28:34,624 --> 01:28:36,415
I will bring Kiki over to see

2107
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:38,291
if they can treat her

2108
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:40,457
Mummy, I'm not going

2109
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:41,457
Why

2110
01:28:41,457 --> 01:28:42,540
I'm okay now

2111
01:28:45,207 --> 01:28:47,832
I was nearly shot in the back, I'm scared

2112
01:28:47,832 --> 01:28:49,248
Kiki, don't be scared

2113
01:28:49,249 --> 01:28:50,915
Mummy will be with you

2114
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:55,248
Mummy, what do I do when you're gone

2115
01:28:55,249 --> 01:28:57,874
I know my son-in-law will take good care of you.

2116
01:28:57,874 --> 01:28:59,790
I'm confident

2117
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:01,707
But that is a long time

2118
01:29:01,707 --> 01:29:03,415
If you get married,

2119
01:29:03,416 --> 01:29:05,499
Mummy will fly back to be there

2120
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:08,374
Future son-in-law, it is your turn

2121
01:29:09,124 --> 01:29:11,040
Don't you have something to announce?

2122
01:29:12,374 --> 01:29:13,790
Michelle and I are serious with our relationship

2123
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:15,999
Auntie, I promise you

2124
01:29:16,332 --> 01:29:18,040
I'll take good care of her

2125
01:29:18,249 --> 01:29:20,165
Since you are so good to Michelle

2126
01:29:20,582 --> 01:29:22,498
Can you answer three questions?

2127
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:23,874
No problem

2128
01:29:24,582 --> 01:29:25,748
First question

2129
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:29,082
There is a 10-billion contract in front of you

2130
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:33,082
At the same time,
Michelle calling you from the hospital

2131
01:29:33,582 --> 01:29:35,748
Needing you to transfuse blood to save her

2132
01:29:35,749 --> 01:29:38,457
Between the contract and Michelle

2133
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:39,332
Which will you choose?

2134
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,498
Easy, I choose Michelle

2135
01:29:42,749 --> 01:29:43,832
Second question

2136
01:29:44,332 --> 01:29:47,582
Is Michelle the last girlfriend you'll ever have?

2137
01:29:47,957 --> 01:29:48,748
Yes

2138
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,291
Yes

2139
01:29:53,999 --> 01:29:55,165
Third question

2140
01:29:55,416 --> 01:29:57,874
Is Michelle the love of your life?

2141
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:00,416
Yes

2142
01:30:07,374 --> 01:30:09,374
When you answered my first question

2143
01:30:10,124 --> 01:30:13,040
You right eye looked up towards the ceiling

2144
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:16,332
According to psychology

2145
01:30:16,832 --> 01:30:19,040
You are not speaking the truth

2146
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:21,040
Second question

2147
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,873
You touched your chest twice

2148
01:30:24,582 --> 01:30:26,332
And said "yes" twice

2149
01:30:26,457 --> 01:30:27,082
Yes

2150
01:30:27,332 --> 01:30:27,957
Yes

2151
01:30:28,041 --> 01:30:30,124
Which covers up your untruthfulness

2152
01:30:30,624 --> 01:30:32,832
When you answered my third question

2153
01:30:33,499 --> 01:30:37,457
You pointed your chopsticks at the door

2154
01:30:38,624 --> 01:30:42,790
Meaning that you wanted to leave, to escape

2155
01:30:44,999 --> 01:30:49,249
Mummy, don't treat Simon like
one of your patients

2156
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:51,249
Simon, I hope you don't mind.

2157
01:30:51,249 --> 01:30:52,457
My mother's just joking with you

2158
01:30:52,457 --> 01:30:54,498
There is really no big deal about it

2159
01:30:54,499 --> 01:30:56,707
So long as my daughter Michelle likes it, that's fine

2160
01:30:57,207 --> 01:31:00,040
Isn't that right? Future son-in-law

2161
01:31:15,041 --> 01:31:17,374
"One year later”

2162
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:25,624
We are running late, the show is starting

2163
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:27,374
Okay, I'll drive faster

2164
01:31:30,374 --> 01:31:31,457
Thank you

2165
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:40,499
Lucky he's not here yet

2166
01:31:40,499 --> 01:31:42,540
You weren't this nervous
when you went out with me

2167
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:43,666
That's different.

2168
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:46,124
We broke up shortly before three months

2169
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:46,957
I'm sorry

2170
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:48,874
No need to be

2171
01:31:48,874 --> 01:31:51,040
I'm the one who should be sorry

2172
01:31:51,457 --> 01:31:54,248
Because I wanted break up soon
after when we got together

2173
01:31:54,249 --> 01:31:56,707
Although you were really handsome, cool and powerful

2174
01:31:56,707 --> 01:31:58,415
But you are just so boring

2175
01:31:59,082 --> 01:32:01,457
And you aren't actually my type of guy

2176
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:04,207
Let's see what your type of guy is

2177
01:32:10,957 --> 01:32:11,915
Ah Ho

2178
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,707
Michelle

2179
01:32:15,249 --> 01:32:17,332
Let me introduce you to my uncle

2180
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,499
Uncle, good to see you

2181
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:20,499
Ho, I see?

2182
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:22,749
You spared time just to give her a ride?

2183
01:32:23,041 --> 01:32:24,541
My uncle pampers me a lot

2184
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:26,832
Good girls deserve much pampering

2185
01:32:27,582 --> 01:32:28,665
I admit that I do

2186
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:30,874
Uncle, We'll get going and not waste your time

2187
01:32:30,999 --> 01:32:32,249
Enjoy yourself

2188
01:32:32,499 --> 01:32:33,290
Ho

2189
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:38,999
Yes, uncle?

2190
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:41,498
I warn you, treat her well

2191
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:43,332
Or else I won't go easy on you

2192
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:44,957
Of course I will, uncle

2193
01:32:44,999 --> 01:32:45,999
Don't call me "uncle"

2194
01:32:46,249 --> 01:32:47,665
We are about the same age

2195
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:50,666
Yeah, Simon

2196
01:32:58,041 --> 01:32:58,874
Thank you

2197
01:32:59,041 --> 01:32:59,874
I tell you

2198
01:33:00,124 --> 01:33:02,082
Mummy will be back in Hong Kong in two days

2199
01:33:04,332 --> 01:33:07,623
I know that look you have when you are in love

2200
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,957
And I've seen it more than once

2201
01:33:26,707 --> 01:33:28,707
Last time Mummy asked you three questions

2202
01:33:28,874 --> 01:33:30,832
She had asked my other boyfriends too

2203
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:33,332
It was really accurate

2204
01:33:35,582 --> 01:33:36,332
See you

2205
01:33:50,749 --> 01:33:51,457
Mr. Leung

2206
01:33:51,749 --> 01:33:53,290
What made you decide three months ago

2207
01:33:53,332 --> 01:33:56,373
To sell your companies at a high price

2208
01:33:56,541 --> 01:33:58,791
And to donate half of your personal assets

2209
01:33:58,916 --> 01:34:02,666
Together with 30% of the shares
in your conglomerate companies

2210
01:34:02,707 --> 01:34:04,540
To start up "Simon Leung Charity Fund"?

2211
01:34:04,624 --> 01:34:05,832
Money is outside the body

2212
01:34:06,082 --> 01:34:08,915
What's important is to help those really in need

2213
01:34:10,124 --> 01:34:12,874
You were entitled "King of Subdivision”

2214
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:16,332
And were widely criticized
for your business ethics

2215
01:34:16,499 --> 01:34:18,082
For squeezing the best out of every deal

2216
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:18,916
But why is it that recently

2217
01:34:18,957 --> 01:34:22,582
Your newly built 18-storey mall

2218
01:34:22,749 --> 01:34:25,790
Which had only six toilets to start with

2219
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:27,374
Was changed just before sale

2220
01:34:27,499 --> 01:34:30,124
To having one toilet in each level?

2221
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:32,499
And you also let the shops for cheap rent

2222
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,457
To young people in support of start-up businesses

2223
01:34:35,582 --> 01:34:37,040
In this generation

2224
01:34:37,207 --> 01:34:39,040
It is very hard for the young to start a business

2225
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:40,999
I was poor when I was young

2226
01:34:41,457 --> 01:34:43,457
I understand the struggle. I want try my best to help

2227
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:44,582
My Leung

2228
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:46,874
For such a drastic change to happen

2229
01:34:46,999 --> 01:34:48,665
Was it because of some sort of impact?

2230
01:34:49,207 --> 01:34:50,915
I hope your body is fine?

2231
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:53,124
A good friend once told me

2232
01:34:53,207 --> 01:34:55,207
I want to tell you that

2233
01:34:55,249 --> 01:34:57,957
Money doesn't solve all your problems

2234
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:00,499
She was right

2235
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:03,957
So I learnt to solve problems using my heart

2236
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:06,666
Once you put your heart into something,
you can do everything

2237
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:23,707
What?

2238
01:35:23,916 --> 01:35:24,707
I nearly sprained my ankle

2239
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:25,999
Don't yell for nothing

2240
01:35:28,832 --> 01:35:30,373
What do you think Simon asked me to come here for?

2241
01:35:30,374 --> 01:35:32,665
Boss, would it be that he wanted to Kill you?

2242
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,541
You got someone to ambush him before

2243
01:35:34,541 --> 01:35:36,874
Maybe he lured you here to kill you

2244
01:35:36,874 --> 01:35:38,790
Shut it. It's fine

2245
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:39,874
He told everyone around that

2246
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:42,040
He didn't mind it. It's fine

2247
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:43,041
Ow

2248
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:43,999
Hey, what now again?

2249
01:35:43,999 --> 01:35:45,499
There are a lot of mosquitoes

2250
01:35:45,499 --> 01:35:46,207
Oh no

2251
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:47,832
What kind of place is this?

2252
01:35:47,832 --> 01:35:48,748
Wait

2253
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:51,416
Zika virus, Dengue fever

2254
01:35:51,874 --> 01:35:53,749
Simon is really evil-minded

2255
01:35:53,749 --> 01:35:55,457
No one would know if we die of poisonous mosquitoes

2256
01:35:55,457 --> 01:35:56,623
Let's leave

2257
01:35:58,041 --> 01:35:58,666
Philip

2258
01:35:58,666 --> 01:35:59,666
Here

2259
01:35:59,832 --> 01:36:01,582
Simon, you jerk, I'm here for lunch,

2260
01:36:01,582 --> 01:36:02,498
not to give out lunch

2261
01:36:02,499 --> 01:36:04,249
How could you ask an elite like me to do this?

2262
01:36:04,249 --> 01:36:06,832
You have seven days a week
to spend thinking about money

2263
01:36:06,832 --> 01:36:08,873
You have no wife, and no kids

2264
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,707
What are you going to do with all that money?

2265
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:14,291
Come volunteer when you are free

2266
01:36:14,832 --> 01:36:16,457
Are you possessed by a ghost?

2267
01:36:16,457 --> 01:36:17,665
You're speaking like a human

2268
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:18,957
Are you cursed or something?

2269
01:36:18,957 --> 01:36:21,165
Yes, we both were cursed

2270
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:22,999
What curse?

2271
01:36:25,332 --> 01:36:26,290
A curse to earn money non-stop

2272
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:28,749
We labour every day

2273
01:36:29,082 --> 01:36:30,373
In this lifetime,

2274
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,749
we missed out on a lot of things

2275
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,249
But I am already released from this curse

2276
01:36:33,791 --> 01:36:35,499
I hope to release you too by asking you to come

2277
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:36,582
Don't you hate me?

2278
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:37,707
When did I ever hate on you

2279
01:36:37,749 --> 01:36:38,874
You bully me all the time

2280
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:40,624
I'm like that to everybody

2281
01:36:42,207 --> 01:36:43,123
As good old pals

2282
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:45,666
All those bad memories in the past

2283
01:36:45,749 --> 01:36:48,540
Let us press a "delete" button and let it go

2284
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:54,499
Then I have misunderstood you

2285
01:36:55,874 --> 01:36:56,874
Sorry, Simon

2286
01:36:57,499 --> 01:36:59,082
I'll do as you say, let's forget about the past

2287
01:37:00,207 --> 01:37:00,707
Put your heart to it

2288
01:37:00,749 --> 01:37:02,207
I will do it with all my heart

2289
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:04,374
Thanks, Simon

2290
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:06,041
All hail Simon

2291
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:07,082
Can I help you?

2292
01:37:07,124 --> 01:37:07,999
No need

2293
01:37:09,832 --> 01:37:10,957
I'm new here,

2294
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:12,790
can you please teach me how to do it?

2295
01:37:12,832 --> 01:37:13,915
Oh, it's easy

2296
01:37:14,457 --> 01:37:14,957
How?

2297
01:37:15,374 --> 01:37:16,165
Put in some egg

2298
01:37:16,207 --> 01:37:16,790
Some egg

2299
01:37:16,832 --> 01:37:17,457
Yes

2300
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:18,623
And some vegetables

2301
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:19,957
Phew, this is complicated

2302
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:20,999
That's it

2303
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:21,582
I see

2304
01:37:21,624 --> 01:37:22,082
Give it a try

2305
01:37:22,124 --> 01:37:23,040
I'll try

2306
01:37:23,624 --> 01:37:24,374
Put in some egg,

2307
01:37:24,916 --> 01:37:25,832
I'm shaking

2308
01:37:25,874 --> 01:37:27,332
- Slowly, slowly
- Put in some vegetables

2309
01:37:27,832 --> 01:37:28,457
Is it like this?

2310
01:37:28,499 --> 01:37:29,249
More

2311
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:29,999
More

2312
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:30,791
Right,

2313
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:31,874
- that's it
- Is it correct?

2314
01:37:32,124 --> 01:37:33,082
You are doing good

2315
01:37:33,124 --> 01:37:33,957
Thank you

2316
01:37:34,124 --> 01:37:34,874
What's your name?

2317
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:36,041
My name is Philip

2318
01:37:36,457 --> 01:37:37,248
I'm Sze-yin

2319
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:39,541
Sze-yin, you sound like a good girl

2320
01:37:39,999 --> 01:37:41,915
Hey, our clothes are matching. They're both pink

2321
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:43,832
This is for girls

2322
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:45,249
Girls?

2323
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:48,916
Simon, you tricked me again

2324
01:37:51,457 --> 01:37:52,582
<i>You are so nice</i>

2325
01:37:52,624 --> 01:37:55,124
You always gave us a lot of delicious food, thank you

2326
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:57,249
Don't mention it.
Being happy is what's most important

2327
01:37:57,832 --> 01:38:00,207
I'll ask the staff to
distribute red packets to everyone

2328
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:02,999
Oh, thank you, this is so good of you

2329
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:05,207
And you brought a friend

2330
01:38:05,249 --> 01:38:07,165
Wow, what a firm chest

2331
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:09,416
Do you have a girlfriend?

2332
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:11,791
Not yet, I don't have one

2333
01:38:12,124 --> 01:38:12,707
No girlfriend yet

2334
01:38:12,749 --> 01:38:14,207
That means I can...

2335
01:38:14,541 --> 01:38:15,416
No way

2336
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:17,790
Although I am pretty

2337
01:38:17,832 --> 01:38:18,540
Yes

2338
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:21,874
But you are not my cup of tea

2339
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:22,874
Scaring me

2340
01:38:22,874 --> 01:38:24,415
I'm talking about my niece

2341
01:38:24,624 --> 01:38:25,457
- Auntie
- No

2342
01:38:25,791 --> 01:38:26,541
Auntie

2343
01:38:26,582 --> 01:38:28,582
Yin treats me the best

2344
01:38:28,749 --> 01:38:29,415
Really?

2345
01:38:29,457 --> 01:38:30,123
Hey

2346
01:38:30,791 --> 01:38:31,957
Act smart

2347
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:33,582
I understand now.

2348
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:34,832
Got it, Auntie

2349
01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:36,540
Auntie told me to act smart,

2350
01:38:36,874 --> 01:38:37,540
act smart

2351
01:38:39,999 --> 01:38:40,540
What now?

2352
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,915
Helping people really brings joy

2353
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:44,707
Are you helping yourself or others?

2354
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:46,166
It's the same, the same

2355
01:38:48,707 --> 01:38:50,332
Simon is a good man

2356
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:51,207
Of course he is

2357
01:38:51,249 --> 01:38:54,332
Some decades ago he beat me up badly

2358
01:38:54,374 --> 01:38:55,082
Is that so?

2359
01:38:55,582 --> 01:38:56,707
And I've forgiven him too

2360
01:38:58,249 --> 01:39:00,457
Thank you and your cha chan teng

2361
01:39:00,499 --> 01:39:02,332
For providing all the food today

2362
01:39:02,374 --> 01:39:04,915
No big deal, and you gotta pay for it too

2363
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:05,916
Let's get to work

2364
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:06,666
Yes

2365
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:07,791
Don't be stingy, okay?

2366
01:39:07,832 --> 01:39:08,957
I won't be,

2367
01:39:09,249 --> 01:39:09,957
okay

2368
01:39:11,124 --> 01:39:13,165
Thank you, thanks a lot

2369
01:39:27,374 --> 01:39:29,540
Good, well done today

2370
01:39:29,582 --> 01:39:30,582
Let's take a selfie

2371
01:39:32,374 --> 01:39:34,624
Yay, selfie time

2372
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:36,082
Okay, come on

2373
01:40:00,124 --> 01:40:02,249
My pager seems to be malfunctioning

2374
01:40:02,374 --> 01:40:04,332
Since you are the boss of the company,

2375
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,249
can you give me a new one?

2376
01:40:06,416 --> 01:40:07,082
If not,

2377
01:40:07,124 --> 01:40:08,374
it is really a shame to your clients

2378
01:40:08,374 --> 01:40:11,124
who paid the monthly fees all along

2379
01:40:11,374 --> 01:40:12,790
You are my premium client

2380
01:40:13,332 --> 01:40:15,373
I'll give you a new number and a new pager

2381
01:40:15,666 --> 01:40:17,874
Available for life, and permanent warranty

2382
01:40:18,374 --> 01:40:19,540
But you can only contact me with that pager

2383
01:40:19,749 --> 01:40:20,832
Then I need to think about it

2384
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:21,832
How long?

2385
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:24,666
Still need to think?

2386
01:40:24,749 --> 01:40:28,082
Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her...

2387
01:40:28,416 --> 01:40:30,624
I'm just abiding by popular opinion

2388
01:40:48,916 --> 01:40:50,041
Spicy fish balls please

2389
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,041
Jo... Joey

2390
01:40:52,166 --> 01:40:54,041
I love your songs

2391
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:55,165
No changed needed

2392
01:40:55,207 --> 01:40:56,207
Thank you

2393
01:40:58,082 --> 01:40:59,332
Hey, Joey

2394
01:41:00,124 --> 01:41:01,374
This is for you,

2395
01:41:02,124 --> 01:41:03,165
it's got a lot in it

2396
01:41:03,207 --> 01:41:03,957
How much is it?

2397
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:05,457
There's no need

2398
01:41:05,749 --> 01:41:07,540
Can we take a picture?

2399
01:41:08,332 --> 01:41:09,373
Oh, sure

2400
01:41:09,416 --> 01:41:12,041
Let me do it, let me do it. Here

2401
01:41:12,082 --> 01:41:14,290
Joey

2402
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:16,624
Strike a cool pose.

2403
01:41:16,666 --> 01:41:18,916
One, two, three, there we go

2404
01:41:19,166 --> 01:41:21,499
Joey, you are really beautiful

2405
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:23,416
I love your songs

2406
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:25,582
You really do?

2407
01:41:25,624 --> 01:41:26,499
Of course

2408
01:41:26,499 --> 01:41:27,790
Sing it to me

2409
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:33,041


2410
01:41:37,582 --> 01:41:38,832
Applause for yourselves

2411
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:41,582
Thanks Joey

2412
01:41:49,166 --> 01:41:50,082
Dr. Bo

2413
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:52,582
How are you? Are you full?

2414
01:41:52,624 --> 01:41:53,582
Fuller than last time

2415
01:41:53,624 --> 01:41:56,540
This means your pressure level is lowered

2416
01:41:56,582 --> 01:41:58,748
Artists like us live in hell

2417
01:41:58,874 --> 01:42:01,082
Every time there is a concert, I have to go on diet

2418
01:42:01,791 --> 01:42:03,124
How could I resist?

2419
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:05,707
Plus, how could I enjoy these fish balls publicly?

2420
01:42:05,749 --> 01:42:06,290
Yes

2421
01:42:06,332 --> 01:42:08,082
That's why I'm really thankful

2422
01:42:08,124 --> 01:42:10,374
For this down-to-earth arrangement

2423
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:13,332
I booked you in for revolving sushi too

2424
01:42:13,374 --> 01:42:15,207
You don't even need to go to Japan

2425
01:42:15,374 --> 01:42:16,374
Really

2426
01:42:16,416 --> 01:42:17,374
Joey,

2427
01:42:17,416 --> 01:42:19,166
you need to be on stage
in the Coliseum in 15 minutes

2428
01:42:19,332 --> 01:42:20,998
What? Oh no. Take this for me

2429
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:22,499
Oh, before going onstage

2430
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:24,582
Don't worry, I'm ready

2431
01:42:24,624 --> 01:42:25,957
Dr. Bo, thank you

2432
01:42:25,999 --> 01:42:27,082
Thank you

2433
01:42:27,124 --> 01:42:27,915
See you next time

2434
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:29,332
Sure. Good show

2435
01:42:29,374 --> 01:42:30,582
- Good show
- Thank you

2436
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:32,374
Tell me when you are free to see my show

2437
01:42:32,374 --> 01:42:34,332
Okay.

2438
01:42:34,374 --> 01:42:35,707
Remember to come back for sushi

2439
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:36,916
Sushi

2440
01:42:37,041 --> 01:42:38,749
- Good show
- Here comes $88,000.

2441
01:42:38,791 --> 01:42:41,124
It's easy to earn a celebrity's money

2442
01:42:41,249 --> 01:42:42,124
Hey, Philip

2443
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:42,832
What

2444
01:42:43,207 --> 01:42:44,623
Because Funny is on holiday,

2445
01:42:44,707 --> 01:42:46,957
and since you are good friends with Simon

2446
01:42:47,082 --> 01:42:49,123
I let you to come intern for a day

2447
01:42:49,291 --> 01:42:51,582
I'm surprised at how well you've done

2448
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:53,582
Goddess, you know the situation I'm in

2449
01:42:53,624 --> 01:42:56,499
And you took care of me.
I can never repay your kindness

2450
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:59,624
It's my fault for not checking up
on your illness regularly

2451
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:01,457
Once I let you out of my eyesight,

2452
01:43:01,499 --> 01:43:02,707
You gamble more and more every day

2453
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:04,916
Now you've lost everything

2454
01:43:05,082 --> 01:43:07,957
I wouldn't bear it if I did nothing

2455
01:43:08,082 --> 01:43:09,790
Goddess, since you are here

2456
01:43:09,874 --> 01:43:11,832
I'll tell you something. Don't be angry though

2457
01:43:11,916 --> 01:43:12,707
Why would I be?

2458
01:43:13,249 --> 01:43:14,165
Hm, look at the bill

2459
01:43:17,207 --> 01:43:19,123
Wow, why is it so long

2460
01:43:19,332 --> 01:43:20,832
$388,000

2461
01:43:20,874 --> 01:43:21,915
$388,000

2462
01:43:21,999 --> 01:43:23,707
What is this? What did you eat?

2463
01:43:24,832 --> 01:43:26,915
This is all street food

2464
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:28,374
What street food?

2465
01:43:28,874 --> 01:43:31,915
That shark fin soup uses real whale shark fin

2466
01:43:31,957 --> 01:43:33,040
Directly from Fook Lam Moon

2467
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:34,082
Why whale shark fin?

2468
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:36,916
It's for the queen of Cantopop,
how could we give her cheap food?

2469
01:43:36,999 --> 01:43:38,749
I hope the fish balls do not use abalone

2470
01:43:39,624 --> 01:43:42,415
Abalone cannot make fish ball paste.
It's from giant groupers

2471
01:43:42,499 --> 01:43:44,165
[t wouldn't cost that much even if that's the case

2472
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:45,582
It's the cheek of giant groupers

2473
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:47,499
One fish ball only uses three groupers,

2474
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:48,582
That's a bargain

2475
01:43:48,707 --> 01:43:49,665
Philip,

2476
01:43:50,207 --> 01:43:51,457
You did really well

2477
01:43:51,499 --> 01:43:52,624
You didn't bring shame on me

2478
01:43:52,666 --> 01:43:53,082
I didn't

2479
01:43:53,124 --> 01:43:54,082
I tell you

2480
01:43:54,124 --> 01:43:57,040
Take all the food back home and eat it

2481
01:43:57,082 --> 01:43:57,498
What?

2482
01:43:57,541 --> 01:43:59,457
I tell you, you can start job-hunting

2483
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:01,624
I can't take care of you anymore, that's it

2484
01:44:01,666 --> 01:44:03,166
Goddess

2485
01:44:03,207 --> 01:44:04,123
What's wrong?

2486
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:05,124
- Why is she angry?
- Good that you are here.

2487
01:44:05,124 --> 01:44:06,332
Help me beg for mercy

2488
01:44:06,374 --> 01:44:08,374
- What's wrong?
- How can I pay the bill?

2489
01:44:08,707 --> 01:44:10,207
This $388,000 bill

2490
01:44:11,291 --> 01:44:13,957
There's no problem being poor.
No one can save you for being stupid

2491
01:44:13,999 --> 01:44:14,665
Don't say that

2492
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:16,332
I think everything between us is over

2493
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:16,999
What's over?

2494
01:44:17,041 --> 01:44:19,582
Pack your things and leave.
You'd be sued for blocking the road

2495
01:44:19,999 --> 01:44:20,582
Best of luck

2496
01:44:20,624 --> 01:44:22,540
Sze-yin, you weren't like that last night

2497
01:44:22,582 --> 01:44:23,707
Boss, let's go to see Joey's concert

2498
01:44:23,749 --> 01:44:25,749
What did I do wrong?

2499
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:27,457
Kung Hei Fat Choi

2500
01:44:27,457 --> 01:44:30,415
MK Woody Allen's La Sing Land casting

2501
01:44:30,416 --> 01:44:31,541
is about to begin

2502
01:44:31,582 --> 01:44:33,248
No need to queue, but don't push

2503
01:44:33,999 --> 01:44:34,790
Why are you here?

2504
01:44:34,874 --> 01:44:35,540
Kiki

2505
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:39,832
I thought I might be able to see you here

2506
01:44:39,999 --> 01:44:41,499
You loved MK Woody Allen

2507
01:44:41,916 --> 01:44:44,666
You must want to be
in his movie as his lead actress

2508
01:44:44,832 --> 01:44:46,207
Go away, I don't know you

2509
01:44:46,291 --> 01:44:47,332
Don't be like that, Kiki

2510
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:50,374
Who left me at the hospital that day?

2511
01:44:51,916 --> 01:44:55,207
Kiki, you sound normal now. You got better

2512
01:44:55,249 --> 01:44:56,457
Your recovery is so fast

2513
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:59,916
I got well a long time ago. I was just faking it

2514
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:01,166
I heard that

2515
01:45:01,166 --> 01:45:04,124
the lead character is retarded in this movie

2516
01:45:04,249 --> 01:45:05,499
So I wanted to get into character first,

2517
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:07,249
and get into method acting

2518
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:12,207
Ladies and gentlemen, in the past 90 minutes

2519
01:45:12,249 --> 01:45:14,915
My retardedness was so on point that
it fooled everyone

2520
01:45:15,874 --> 01:45:17,415
Stop playing with my hair

2521
01:45:19,499 --> 01:45:21,790
I was nearly shot in the back, I'm scared

2522
01:45:21,832 --> 01:45:25,040
Such awesome acting, I won't say it's the best

2523
01:45:25,832 --> 01:45:26,873
But at least it is worth an award

2524
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:28,749
You even sacrificed me for this character,

2525
01:45:29,124 --> 01:45:29,790
you must be able to get it

2526
01:45:29,832 --> 01:45:30,748
Why are you here?

2527
01:45:31,499 --> 01:45:33,582
I'm also an MK Woody Allen fan

2528
01:45:33,707 --> 01:45:35,207
Where there is a female lead,

2529
01:45:35,207 --> 01:45:36,332
there must be a male lead character

2530
01:45:36,791 --> 01:45:37,624
Kiki,

2531
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:39,207
since we are both confident

2532
01:45:39,332 --> 01:45:40,582
If we do the casting as a couple,

2533
01:45:40,749 --> 01:45:42,415
it must help score more points

2534
01:45:42,624 --> 01:45:45,165
This idea is great, I've thought of it too

2535
01:45:45,332 --> 01:45:46,582
But not with you

2536
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:47,207
Why?

2537
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:49,999
Why don't I introduce my new boyfriend

2538
01:45:51,332 --> 01:45:51,748
Hi

2539
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:52,791
You... why...

2540
01:45:52,832 --> 01:45:53,998
The movie's about to end

2541
01:45:54,249 --> 01:45:56,082
Let's not talk about what happened before

2542
01:45:56,124 --> 01:45:57,165
Simply put,

2543
01:45:57,416 --> 01:45:58,207
Kiki and I

2544
01:45:58,582 --> 01:46:01,207
It was love at first sight, like a spark of fire

2545
01:46:01,582 --> 01:46:03,790
No way, you must be acting again

2546
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:05,874
Kiki, haven't you told him

2547
01:46:06,124 --> 01:46:07,832
We are so very in love

2548
01:46:09,916 --> 01:46:11,124
Wonderful. So scram

2549
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:12,832
Scram? You scram

2550
01:46:12,874 --> 01:46:14,165
- You go
- You go

2551
01:46:14,207 --> 01:46:14,748
You go

2552
01:46:14,791 --> 01:46:16,124
Go where? Go where?

2553
01:46:16,166 --> 01:46:18,874
What? Go? Go where?

2554
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:20,582
Stop, I'll go

2555
01:46:21,999 --> 01:46:23,290
- You go
- We aren't done

2556
01:46:23,332 --> 01:46:24,582
- Leave
- I'm not leaving

2557
01:46:24,624 --> 01:46:25,582
- Just go away
- You go away

2558
01:46:25,624 --> 01:46:26,457
Why don't you go?

2559
01:46:26,624 --> 01:46:27,540
Stop it.

2560
01:46:27,541 --> 01:46:28,749
Everyone's gone,
what is there to argue?

2561
01:46:28,749 --> 01:46:29,790
No one likes you here, go away

2562
01:46:29,832 --> 01:46:30,707
I'm back

2563
01:46:30,749 --> 01:46:31,415
- Kiki
- How was it?

2564
01:46:31,457 --> 01:46:31,873
Yeah, how was it?

2565
01:46:31,916 --> 01:46:32,666
I asked first, answer me

2566
01:46:32,666 --> 01:46:33,499
You just need to answer me

2567
01:46:33,582 --> 01:46:35,582
I did all that I could,

2568
01:46:35,707 --> 01:46:36,790
and I sang

2569
01:46:36,874 --> 01:46:37,499
What did you sing?

2570
01:46:37,874 --> 01:46:39,040
I'll sing it for you

2571
01:46:40,166 --> 01:46:42,957
"St Paul's, Buddha's Statue,

2572
01:46:43,166 --> 01:46:45,582
A-Ma Temple all beautiful views"

2573
01:46:46,332 --> 01:46:48,332
Well done

2574
01:46:48,374 --> 01:46:49,457
And I danced

2575
01:46:49,499 --> 01:46:50,165
What did you dance?

2576
01:46:50,207 --> 01:46:50,915
I'll show you

2577
01:46:50,957 --> 01:46:51,623
Sure

2578
01:46:56,499 --> 01:46:57,124
Wonderful

2579
01:46:57,166 --> 01:46:58,499
That's not it, there's more

2580
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:02,249
Bravo

2581
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:03,207
You must get the role

2582
01:47:03,249 --> 01:47:03,832
No

2583
01:47:03,874 --> 01:47:04,999
She said the role is not for me

2584
01:47:05,124 --> 01:47:05,790
Why?

2585
01:47:05,832 --> 01:47:07,582
You did so well, that's not right

2586
01:47:07,624 --> 01:47:09,624
"Fudge" it. The movie is in English

2587
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:11,457
Nobody told me that

2588
01:47:11,499 --> 01:47:12,165
In English?

2589
01:47:12,207 --> 01:47:14,165
Western movies are in English, don't you know?

2590
01:47:14,249 --> 01:47:15,290
- Western movie?
- Yes

2591
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:16,915
Since when is MK Woody Allen that good?

2592
01:47:16,999 --> 01:47:18,499
His movies are always kind of "western"

2593
01:47:18,957 --> 01:47:19,957
Why didn't you tell me,

2594
01:47:19,999 --> 01:47:21,582
I shouldn't have done method acting

2595
01:47:21,624 --> 01:47:23,249
I should have learnt English instead

2596
01:47:24,749 --> 01:47:26,999
MK Woody Allen is such a jerk

2597
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:29,707
All of his movie names are the same,
who's going to remember

2598
01:47:30,041 --> 01:47:32,457
I won't tolerate it even if I'm a fan

2599
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:33,499
Do you have any suggestions?

2600
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:34,291
Let's go beat him up

2601
01:47:34,332 --> 01:47:34,957
Go

2602
01:47:34,999 --> 01:47:35,665
Okay

2603
01:47:58,582 --> 01:48:01,748
Peace and harmony to you
and your family in the Year of the Dog

2604
01:48:01,832 --> 01:48:03,623
May everything go well for you

2605
01:48:03,916 --> 01:48:06,291
Wish everyone a good morning, goodnight,

2606
01:48:06,374 --> 01:48:08,582
and good health every day

2607
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:11,290
Wish you all an energetic year ahead

2608
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:13,791
May all your wishes come true

2609
01:48:13,832 --> 01:48:15,665
Great fortunes and prosperity

2610
01:48:15,707 --> 01:48:18,915
Wish you a great start after good rest,

2611
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:21,791
the best and the good jest

2612
01:48:21,791 --> 01:48:25,166
To good health and

2613
01:48:25,207 --> 01:48:29,248
a good future in the Year of the Dog
