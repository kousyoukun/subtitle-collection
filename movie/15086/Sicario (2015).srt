00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,470
兄弟们 你们先行一步
Hey, guys, just start without me.

28
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,890
我稍后就来
I'll catch up.

29
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,910
舒坦
Sweet.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,710
波澜不惊 方能心如止水
Inner peace. Inner peace.

鼻子好痒
Itchy nose.

阿嚏
Ah-choo!

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,230
终于 静心了
Finally, inner peace.

34
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,060
又怎么了
Now, what?

37
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,380
你我之争早在五百年前就结束了
Our battle ended 500 years ago.

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,990
可我已经准备好再比一场了
Well, now I'm ready for a rematch.

39
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,920
你准备得可真够久的 哈哈哈
Took you long enough. Ha ha ha ha...

40
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,490
呀啊
Yaaa!

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,130
你的确变强了
You've grown stronger.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,200
五百年灵界的修炼 不是白练的
500 years in the Spirit Realm, you pick up a thing or two.

43
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,790
我已经夺走了灵界每个大师的气
I have taken the Chi of every Master here.

44
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,740
- 不 - 是的
- No! - Yes.

45
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,480
很快你的力量也是我的了
And soon I will have your power too.

46
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,100
你何时才能领悟 索取越多 收获越少
When will you realize, the more you take, the less you have.

47
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,100
有了你的气 我终于又可以重回凡界
With your Chi, I will finally be able to return to the mortal world,

48
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,050
这一次 你阻止不了我了
And this time, you won't be there to stop me.

49
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,080
噢 阻止你从来都不是我的使命
Ah, it was never my destiny to stop you.

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,950
我已经有了一个好的人选
I have set another on that path.

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,770
那我就找到他 然后把他的气也夺走
Then I will find him, and take his Chi too.

52
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,940
正义就要得到伸张了
Justice, is about to be served.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,160
给我们来两份正义套餐 谢谢
We'll have two justice platters , please

54
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,210
- 呃 三份 - 三份 - 再要几个豆腐花
- umm...three - Three. - And a few tofu buns.

55
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,910
还要一碗香辣拌面 给娇虎的 你要另外加酱料吗
Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress. Did you want extra sauce with that?

56
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,050
她要分开放
She wants it on the side

57
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,010
- 分开 - 分开放
- On the side. - On the side.

58
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,670
神龙 你能做到
Dragon, you can do it.

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,020
- 冲吧 神龙大侠 - 保卫村庄
- Go, Dragon Warrior. - Defend the valley.

60
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,160
- 去呀 神龙大侠 - 保卫村庄
- Go Dragon Warrior. - Yeah, defend the valley

61
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,310
啊哒
Yee-ha!

62
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,490
你们没摆霸气的造型 对吧
You guys aren't doing the dramatic pose , are you?

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,130
我们需要每次出场都摆个造型吗
Do we have to strike a pose every time we land?

64
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,390
大伙儿 永远不要低估霸气登场的威力
You guys, never underestimate the power of a dramatic entrance.

65
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,340
我听说某些大师只靠破门之势
I've heard about some Masters who could win a fight

66
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,840
就能闪瞎对手赢得战斗
just by throwing open a door

67
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,270
嘿呀
Shuh-sha!

68
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,060
霸气登场
Dramatic entrance?

69
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,040
师傅
Master Shifu

70
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,150
神龙大侠说得对
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

71
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,830
是吗 我只是随口... 啊对 我就这个意思
Really? I was just making.... yeah, I mean, yeah, I am.

72
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,080
双方交战先比气势 后比拳头
Before the battle of the fist comes the battle of the mind.

73
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,550
因此 出场就是要霸气
Hence...the dramatic entrance.

74
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,010
哇 好霸气的登场
Whoa ,nice dramatic entrance.

75
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,730
- 今天是什么日子呀 - 今天将是我的最后一堂课
- What's the occasion? - Today will be my final class.

76
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,330
你的最后...等等 我都不知道你病了
Your final...? Wait. I didn't even know you were sick.

77
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,320
- 虽然你看上去是有点... - 我没病
- Although you have been looking a little.... - I'm not sick.

78
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,210
健康 有点健康 应该说很健康
healthy. A little healthy. A lot actually.

79
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,230
之所以是最后一课
My final class because from now on...

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,300
是因为接下来 负责你们训练的将会是神龙大侠
your training will be in the hands of the Dragon Warrior.

81
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,710
什么
What?

82
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,620
我来教 为什么不是娇虎
Me? teach? I mean why not Tigress?

83
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,550
她总是喜欢吆喝别人做这个做那个
She's always telling everyone what to do.

84
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,700
- 闭嘴 阿宝 - 看到了吧
- Be quiet Po. - See what I mean?

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,890
娇虎不是神龙大侠 你才是
Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior. You are.

86
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,280
别闹了 他们可是盖世五侠 我能教他们什么呀
Come on they're the Five. What can I teach them?

87
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,510
学海无涯 就连师傅也是
There is always something more to learn. Even for a Master.

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,120
打个比方 我来教你另一招
For instance, let me show you another move.

89
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,740
华丽退场
The dramatic exit.

90
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,570
那是啥
What's that?

91
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,220
哇
Whoa!

92
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,010
你在开玩笑吗 这...
Are you kidding me? That....what?

93
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,390
- 他去哪儿了 - 师傅
- Where'd he go? - Master.

94
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,480
他已经走啦 别那么严肃
- He's gone guys. It's cool.

95
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,400
听从您的指点 师傅
- We await your instruction, Master.

96
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,290
你若教不好 最多不被我们尊敬
All you have to lose is our respect.

97
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,550
说实话 能有多糟糕呢
Seriously, how bad could it be?

98
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,630
很糟糕 糟糕透了
Very bad! Very, very bad!

99
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,430
好了 我们换别的招式 金猴 使出稳如泰山
Okay. Okay, let's switch it up. Monkey, Immovable Mountain Stance.

100
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,130
是 师傅
Yes, Master.

101
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,050
- 我是说... 娇虎 旋风后空翻 - 是 师傅
- I mean.... Tigress, Tornado back flip. - Yes, Master.

102
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,610
- 噢不 火 - 开火
- Oh no, fire. - Fire.

103
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,710
抱歉 我的错 仙鹤再飞高点 啊不 低一点
Sorry, my fault. Crane go high, I mean low.

104
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,160
啊 我的小钳子
Oh, my claw thingy.

105
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,740
呃 灵蛇和娇虎 来一招虎啸蛇盘
Uh, Viper and tigress , to... like a totem pole.

106
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
放毒 进攻
Poison , Technique.

107
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,590
你们俩 使出白鹤亮翅 猴子摘桃 黄尾巴 黄马褂...
You two, to... Sworming insect bite with yellow tail , Yellow jacket...

108
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,140
香辣...金枪鱼
Spicy....tuna.

109
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,360
你干的好事 阿宝
Good job, Po.

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,620
啊
Ah.

111
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,100
你有学到一点点东西吗
Did you at least learn a little something?

112
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,010
有 你不是当老师的料
Yes , that you can't teach.

113
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,260
还有 原来娇虎是易燃物
And tigress is flammable, turns out.

114
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,150
简直惨不忍睹
That was a complete disaster.

115
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,370
- 我真庆幸自己不是阿宝 - 他真是一无是处
- I'm glad we're not Po right now. - What a loser.

116
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,310
不知道师傅是怎么想的
- What was Shifu thinking?

117
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,110
乌龟大师又是怎么想的
- What was Oogway thinking?

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,900
- 我觉得被他听到了 - 我啥都没听到
- I think he heard us. - I didn't hear anything.

119
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,610
他说你一无是处
He said you're a loser.

120
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,280
对不起 乌龟
Sorry, Oogway.

121
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,660
- 你能不能别这样了 - 你的第一课感觉如何
- Would you stop doing that? - How was your fisrt day teaching?

122
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,940
- 超丢脸 - 我听说了
- Humiliating. - I heard.

123
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,680
谁告诉你的 是娇虎吗
Who told you? Did Tigress tell you?

124
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,760
金猴 仙鹤 螳螂 你爸和隔壁礼品店的周大妈
I heard from Monkey and Crane and Mantis and your dad and Mrs. Chau from the gift shop

125
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,430
还有刚走过的那群鸭子以及娇虎告诉我的
And those ducks who just passed and Tigress told me.

126
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,580
好吧 那她有没有告诉你我以后再也不会了
Yeah, well did she also tell you that it'll never happen again cause I'm done?

127
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,830
你是指授课 还是丢脸
Teaching, or being humiliated?

128
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,900
都是 我都不知道你为什么认为我能教他们呢
Both. I don't know why you ever thought I could teach that class?

129
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,530
我就知道你不行
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

130
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,670
啥 你故意的吗 为什么
What? You set me up to fail? Why?

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,740
如果你只做你力所能及的事 你就没法进步
If you only do what you can do you'll never be more than you are now.

132
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,560
我不想要进步了 我这样就很好
I don't wanna be more. I like who I am.

133
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,400
你连自己是谁都不知道
You don't even know who you are.

134
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,740
你说啥 我当然知道 我是神龙大侠
What do you....? Of course I do. I'm the Dragon Warrior.

135
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,790
那神龙大侠究竟意味着什么呢
And what exactly does that mean Dragon Warrior?

136
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,740
意味着...我要四处闯荡 拳打脚踢
It means...you know... just going around and punching and kicking

137
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,470
保卫家园什么的
Defending the valley and stuff.

138
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,230
拳打脚踢
Punching and kicking?

139
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,440
你认为这就是乌龟大师看中你的原因吗
You think that is what the great Master Oogway saw for you?

140
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,620
一个五百年的预言选中了你
A five hundred year prophecy full-filled

141
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,880
难道就是让你耍耍花拳绣腿
so you can spend your days...

142
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,230
满镇子乱跑跟兔子耍帅吗
Kicking butt? And running through town high-fiving bunnies?

143
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,090
- 不是吗 - 不是
- Yes. - No!

144
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,710
阿宝 乌龟与我的意见相悖 他在你身上看到了潜能
Oogway saw greatness in you, Po, against my better judgement.

145
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,880
比你想象的还要多
More than you can see in yourself.

146
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,440
有一种神功等着你去发掘
Incredible power awaits you.

147
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,450
这种神功强大到你无法想像
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

148
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,450
哇噢
Whoa!

149
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,290
- 这是什么神功 - 这就是气功
- What was that? - That was chi.

150
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,870
哇噢 气是啥
Whoa! What's chi?

151
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,900
世间万物流转的能量就是气
The energy that flows through all living things.

152
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,940
所以你的意思是 如果我当了他们的老师
So you're saying if I, so you're saying if I teach,

153
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,400
我就可以练成这种神功了吗
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?

154
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,070
不 我是说如果你当了他们的老师后
No, I'm saying if you teach,

155
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,070
我就可以练成这种神功了
I'll be able to do cool stuff like that.

156
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,300
- 噢 - 气的运用需要自我修炼
- Oh. - Mastery of chi requires Mastery of self.

157
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,070
乌龟曾在一个山洞里打坐整整三十年
Oogway sat alone in a cave for thirty years

158
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,200
只为弄清一个问题
asking one question....

159
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,100
我是谁
Who am I?

160
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,760
我是谁
Who am I?

161
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,400
如果你能安静五分钟让我说完就好了
I'm lucky if I get 5 minutes before you interrupt.

162
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,700
所以我现在要找个山洞呆上三十年吗
So now I have to sit alone in a cave for thirty years?

163
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,690
总归要的 当你完成授课的时候
Eventually. After you Master teaching.

164
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,920
授课 我根本不可能做到像你这样
Teaching? There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you.

165
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,250
我没让你变成我这样
I'm not trying to turn you into me.

166
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,200
我是让你变成你自己
I'm trying to turn you into you.

167
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,620
让我变成我自己 等会儿 这没道理啊...
Turn me into me? Wait a second. That makes no....

168
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,440
加把劲 师傅 说得再玄乎一点 你就是下一个乌龟了
Almost there Shifu , just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.

169
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,290
噢 啊
Oh. Ah.

170
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,840
抱歉 乌龟大师 无意冒犯...
Sorry, no offense Master Oogway I just....

171
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,840
我就不打扰您的安宁了
I'll let you get back to your eternal peace.

172
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,570
- 这是哪儿 - 呃 我哥哥的菜地
- What is this place? - Aaah...my brother's farm?

173
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,690
哦 那如果我踩你一脚 你会死吗
Ah. If I stepped on you, would you die?

174
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,340
会
Yes.

175
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,550
这就是凡界
The mortal realm.

176
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,480
你听到了吗 乌龟 我回来了
You hear that Oogway? I'm back.

177
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,460
天煞回来了
Kai has returned.

178
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,450
- 谁 - 天煞 所向披靡的天煞
- Who? - Kai. General Kai.

179
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,850
这片神州大地最高的统帅
Supreme warlord of all China.

180
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,260
没听过
I don't know.

181
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,170
追魂翡翠 苦难之源
The jade slayer, Master of pain.

182
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,220
那你至少应该听过复仇之兽吧
You may know me as the beast of vengeance.

183
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,310
寡妇制造者呢
Maker of widows?

184
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,090
好吧 我以前跟乌龟是战友
Ok, I used to work with Oogway.

185
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,160
哦 乌龟大师 他可是名副其实的战士
Oh, Master Oogway, he was a great warrior.

186
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,920
我们知道乌龟大师 又智慧又...
- We've heard of Master Oogway. Wise and...

187
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,890
好了好了 够了
- Ok, ok, enough.

188
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,710
闭嘴
Silence!

189
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,410
找到乌龟的弟子 全部抓来见我
Find Oogway's students and bring them to me.

190
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,460
等我夺走了他们的气 乌龟...
By the time I am done with them, Oogway...

191
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,280
这世上就没人会记得你的名字了
There will be no one left to who will even remember your name.

192
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,580
哈哈哈 我天煞来了
Ha ha ha! Kai is coming!

193
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,930
我准备好了...
I am ready...

194
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,510
- 来教训你了 - 教训我
- to teach you a lesson. - Teach me?

195
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,880
- 哦不 是神龙大师 - 妈呀他太帅了
- Oh no, ite's the Dragon teacher. - Yeah he's so handsome.

196
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,960
多谢夸奖
Thank you for the compliment.

197
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,190
不 绕我一命吧
No, please don't teach me to death.

198
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,660
阿宝
Po?

199
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,920
嗨老爸 你好吗
Oh, hey dad. What's up?

200
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,720
我只是 回家泡个澡而已
I like just .... stopping by for a little soak.

201
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,380
- 说吧 出什么事啦 - 没事
- Okay , What's wrong? - Nothing.

202
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,200
没事 我回家发现你在这跟你的娃娃鸳鸯戏水...
Nothing? I come home to find you taking a bath with your dolls...

203
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,990
- 是人偶 - 而且加的不是浴盐
- Action figures. - And instead of adding bath-salt to the water.

204
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,840
- 反而加了四川辣椒面 - 啥 四川辣椒面
- You just added szechuan peppercorns. - Szechuan, what?

205
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,810
噢 噢 我白嫩的小屁股
Oh, oh, oh... my tenders.

206
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,430
好啦 我是有心事
Okay, yes, something's wrong.

207
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,580
乖儿子 告诉爸爸发生了什么事
There, there, son , you tell your daddy all about it.

208
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,090
胳膊抬起来
Lift your arm.

209
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,170
师傅说我还不知道神龙大侠的意义
Shifu says I don't know what it means to be the Dragon Warrior.

210
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,450
现在我居然还要当老师了
And now I have to be a teacher?

211
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,180
我以为我找到了自我
I thought I finally knew who I was.

212
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,340
可如果我不是神龙大侠 那么我又是谁呢
If I'm not the dragon Warrior, then who am I?

213
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,000
老师 教人功夫吗
A teacher? Teaching kung fu?

214
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,390
阿宝 这可是份美差啊 还犹豫啥 儿子
Po, that's a promotion. Take the job, son.

215
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,360
等有一天 你掌管了翡翠宫
And someday, when you're in charge of the whole Jade palace,

216
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,760
我就可以在大厅里卖面条了 哟呼
I can sell noodles in the lobby. Yoohoo.

217
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,090
你怎么还在这泡澡 跟个娃娃似的
Why are you still here taking a bath like a baby?

218
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,950
起来 起来 赶紧去干活
Get out. Get up. Go, go, go.

219
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,100
我们的店面就要扩张啦
- Franchise expansion awaits us!

220
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,390
那神龙大侠模仿大赛怎么办
- What about the Dragon Warrior look alike contest?

221
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,010
- 反正周大妈每次都赢 - 接招吧
- Mrs. Chau always wins that. - Skadoosh.

222
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,400
那神龙大侠吃包子大赛呢
And the Dragon Warrior dumpling eating contest?

223
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,820
我要保持我的不败记录
I have to defend my title.

224
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,270
没有人能打破你吃包子的记录
No one's gonna beat your dumpling eating record.

225
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,360
有人要打破你吃包子的记录啦
Someone's about to beat your dumpling eating record.

226
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,600
加油 加油
Go. Go. Go.

227
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,970
- 谁在吃我的包子 - 账算在谁头上
- Who's eating my dumplings? - And who's paying for them?

228
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,990
一百零一 一百零二
101, 102.

229
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,590
一百零三
103.

230
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,560
耶
Yeah!

231
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,580
新纪录吗
Is that a new record?

232
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,380
你是谁
Who are you?

233
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,670
- 我是李山 - 什么
- I'm Li Shan - What?

234
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,280
我叫李山
I'm Li shan.

235
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,980
我在找我儿子
I'm looking for my son.

236
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,580
- 你儿子不见了 - 是啊 多年以前丢的
- You lost your son? - Yes, many years ago.

237
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,590
- 我也跟我爸爸失散了 - 真抱歉
- I lost my father. - Very sorry.

238
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,560
谢谢你
Thank you.

239
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,880
好吧 祝你好运
Well , good luck to you.

240
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,510
你也是 希望你能找到你儿子
You too. I hope you find your son.

241
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,230
我也希望你能找到你爸爸
And I hope you find your father.

242
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,930
- 儿子 - 哈
- Son? - Huh?

243
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,220
我的天啊 真是你
Oh my gosh, it is you.

244
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,730
别傻站着呀 快给你老爸一个拥抱
Well, don't just stand there! Give your old man a hug!

245
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,130
不敢相信你还活着
I can't believe you're alive.

246
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,120
- 耶 - 耶
- Yeah! - Yeah!

247
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,470
我以为我永远地失去你了 小莲花
I thought I'd lost you forever, Little Lotus.

248
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,170
好吧 这下有点尴尬了
Oh, Okay. This is very embarrassing,

249
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,870
我想你认错儿子了 我不叫莲花 我叫阿宝
but I think you've got me confused with a panda named Lotus. My name is Po.

250
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,040
啊对了 你也许...
Oh right, you wouldn't... Okay.

251
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,380
这么说吧 小莲花是你的乳名
See, Little Lotus was the name you were given at birth.

252
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,750
- 真的吗 - 真的
- Really? -Really.

253
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,800
难以置信 这么多年了终于找到你了
I can't believe it. After all these years and you're really here?

254
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,520
这简直太神奇了
This is amazing.

255
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,150
老爸 这位是...
Oh, Dad. Come say hi to...

256
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,420
呃 我不知道应该怎么称呼你
Um. I don't know--I don't know what I'm supposed to call you.

257
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,670
他刚才说他叫李山
I'm pretty sure he said his name is Li.

258
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,670
你 来抱抱
You...come here

259
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,180
太谢谢你了 把我的儿子照顾得那么好
Thank you, thank you for taking such good care of my son.

260
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,510
你的儿子 先等等
Your son? Now hold on just a minute.

261
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,360
我们怎么知道这个人跟你有没有联系
How do we know this stranger is even related to you?

262
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,430
你看啊 一看肚子就知道是自家人
Look at that. Our bellies could be brothers.

263
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,590
嘿儿子 我来教你怎么拱肚子 来 拱肚子
Hey son, let me teach you how to Belly Gong. All right, belly gong.

264
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,570
太酷炫了 它们震动的频率还一致
That's so cool. They jiggle the same.

265
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,420
好像在照镜子一样
It's like looking in a fat mirror.

266
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,120
真想不到 我们还能一起合影
I can't believe we're taking a picture together.

267
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,350
我还是不明白 我以为阿宝是最后一只熊猫了
But I still don't understand. I thought Po was the only panda left.

268
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,940
- 不 还有一大群呢 - 在哪
- No, there's a whole bunch of us. - Where?

269
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,320
- 就在山里的神秘熊猫村里 - 神秘熊猫...
- Here, a secret panda village in the mountains. - A secret panda....

270
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,600
哇噢
Whoa.

271
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,910
可是你是怎么知道我在这的
But how did you know where I was?

272
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,820
我收到的消息指引我来的
I received a message that led me here.

273
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,070
如果没人找得到你 你是怎么收到消息的
How could you receive a message if no one could find you?

274
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,390
太可疑了
Sounds suspicious to me.

275
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,340
不 等等 这是一则来自宇宙的消息

How'd you know I was the Dragon Warrior? Did the universe tell you that, too?

Feeling the burn.

288
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,040
你也有熊猫哮喘综合征吗 我们是不是家族遗传啊
Do you have panda asthma, too? Does that run in the family?

289
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,910
爸 你肯定会爱上这儿的

Awesome? You were going--you were going to say awesome, right?

295
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,430
- 因为真是太棒啦 - 太棒啦
- Because it totally is! - Totally!

296
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,730
不过你要超级小心 这里都是些易碎品
But be super careful, everything is very fragile here.

297
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,660
比如说这个装着武士耳语的灵坛

302
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,350
我很好奇我能不能塞进去
- I wonder if I could fit in that.

303
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,150
你是我肚子里的蛔虫吗 老爸 我跟你想的一样
Get out of my head, dad. I've wondered the same thing.

想知道我穿不穿得下

有觉得自己坚不可摧吗
Does it feel like you're impenetrable?

318

有觉得自己能够以一敌千

却毫发无损吗

320
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,350

Okay, but we gotta plan what we're gonna say first,

400
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,010
要不然的话 那就不是可怕了 而是蠢了

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,680
- 看到了吗 看到了吗 - 发生了什么
- Did you see that? Did you see? - What just happened?

405
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,170
那些绿烟就咻的一下 又咻地消失了
The green smoke just poof.... and then poof.

406
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,600
师傅 那是什么
Shifu, what wast that?

407
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,870
天煞 天煞 天煞 是谁呢
Kai? Kai? Kai?

408
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,010
不知道 没听过
Nope. Never heard of him.

409
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,830
天煞 天煞 在哪里
Kai... Kai... Where is it?

410
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,690
这里太多装满智慧的卷轴了 什么都找不到
There's so much wisdom in here, I can't find anything.

411
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,130
找到了
Yes!

412
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,530
看好了
Behold.

413
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,520
所有答案都将在这里找到
All the answers will be found within.

414
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,140
什么 一片空白
What? It's blank?

415
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,460
是在耍我吗 又来这套
Are you kidding me? Not again.

416
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,220
等等 等一下 抱歉 好了 我们开始吧
Wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry, okay, here we go.

417
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,410
是乌龟亲手写的
It is written in Oogway's hand.

418
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,410
- 很久以前 我有一个兄弟 - 乌龟竟然有兄弟
- Long ago, I had a brother. - Oogway had a brother?

419
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,470
战友 是战友 抱歉
In arms. In arms, sorry.

420
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,290
他写的是兄弟般的战友
- He says brother in arms.

421
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,240
你就不能一次性展开卷轴吗
- Can't you just unroll it all at once?

422
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,020
我曾是一名雄心勃勃的年轻战士 带领一支伟大的军队
I was an ambitious young warrior leading a great army.

423
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,870
与我并肩作战的就是天煞
And fighting by my side was Kai.

424
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,820
我最亲密的朋友
My closest friend.

425
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,080
有一天 我们遭到了埋伏 我身负重伤
One day we were ambushed. I was badly wounded.

426
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,170
我的朋友背着我日以继夜地寻求帮助
My friend carried me for days looking for help.

427
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,960
最后我们来到一个高山上的神秘村庄
Until we came to a secret village, high in the mountains.

428
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,070
古老的疗伤圣地
An ancient place of healing.

429
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,640
全村都是熊猫
A village of pandas.

430
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,040
- 熊猫 - 对 熊猫
- Pandas? - Yes, pandas.

431
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,040
熊猫他们用气功治好了我
Pandas who used the power of chi to heal me.

432
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,320
他们还教会我如何释放气
They taught me how to give chi.

433
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,490
但天煞想独占所有气
But Kai, wanted the power all to himself.

434
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,730
他发现气既能被给予 也能被夺走
He saw that what could be given could also be taken.

435
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,980
我必须阻止他
I had to stop him.

436
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,740
我们打得山摇地动
Our battle shook the Earth.

437
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,010
最终 我将他打入灵界
Until, finally, I banished Kai to the Spirit Realm.

438
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,820
若他重返人间
Should he ever return to the mortal realm,

439
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,140
唯有真正的气功大师才能阻止他
he can only be stopped by a true Master of chi.

440
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,070
真正的气功大师 比如你
True Master of chi? Like you.

441
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,200
我 我只能发功让花盛开而已
Me? I can barely make a flower bloom!

442
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,650
我至少还要在山洞里修炼三十年
I'd need at least thirty more years, and a cave.

443
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,200
我们需要一个气功大师
We need a chi Master.

444
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,320
他会继续夺走别的大师的气 世上就再也没气了
He will continue stealing the chi of Masters until he has consumed it all.

445
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,360
我们必须想办法阻止他
We have to make a way to stop him.

446
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,180
败下的大师越多 他得到的气也就越多
He gets more more powerful with every Master he defeats.

447
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,840
我们没别的选择 只能去战斗
There is no choice. We fight.

448
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,180
我可以教你 儿子
I can teach you, son.

449
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:37,590
- 你可以教我 - 当然 我是只熊猫
- You can do this? - Of course, I'm a panda.

450
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,680
这肯定是宇宙让你来的原因
That must be why the universe sent you here.

451
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,000
好 那我要做什么
Okay, so what do I have to do?

452
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,920
- 你要跟我回家 - 什么
- You have to come home with me. - What?

453
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,610
- 回到神秘村庄 - 对 儿子
- To the secret village? - Yes, son.

454
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,540
你必须重新学会如何做一只熊猫
You must rediscover what it is to be a panda.

455
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,230
你要学会如何像熊猫那样生活 像熊猫那样睡觉
You have to learn how to live like a panda. Sleep like a panda.

456
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,810
像熊猫那样吃东西
Eat like a panda.

457
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,560
103个包子 还没够我塞牙缝呢
Those 103 dumplings? I was just warming up.

458
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,200
我一直认为 我吃东西的潜力还没全部挖掘出来
I've always felt like I wasn't eating up to my full potential.

459
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,640
你不能把我们家阿宝带走 不不 我要别的意见
You can't take Po away from me. No, no I want a second opinion.

460
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,450
师傅 再开一卷吧
Shifu, open another scroll or something.

461
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,600
- 我觉得他应该去 - 好 再来个意见
- I think he should go. - Fine. A third opinion.

462
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,060
金猴 灵蛇 娇虎
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

463
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,920
老爸 你也听到师傅说的和乌龟写的
Dad, you heard what Shifu said, Oogway said.

464
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,590
只有真正的气功大师才能阻止天煞
This guy can only be stopped by a Master of chi.

465
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,310
而我只有知道我究竟是谁才能学会用气
And I can only master chi by knowing who I really am.

466
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,200
我 我是熊猫
Well, I'm a panda.

467
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,820
我去给你准备路上的午餐
I'll pack your lunch for the road.

468
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,220
你真的认为阿宝能及时学会气功吗
Do you really think Po can master chi in time?

469
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,930
我的想法并不重要
Doesn't matter what I think.

470
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,180
- 宇宙怎么想才是最重要的 - 所以答案是不会
- It only matters what the universe thinks. - So, that's a "No"?

471
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,930
- 师傅 我们要做什么 - 你去查明天煞的下落
- Master, what are we going to do? - You are going to find out where Kai is.

472
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,350
寻着那些翡翠僵尸的踪迹 但千万别跟他打起来
Follow the trail of those jade creatures but do not engage.

473
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,020
因为天煞会越战越强
For with every foe he faces Kai becomes stronger.

474
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,670
为什么选我 是因为我多嘴吗
- Why me? Is it because I asked.

475
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,320
不是 因为你能飞
- No, it is because you can fly.

476
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,930
- 去吧 - 早知道就闭上你的鸟嘴了
- Go! - Should have kept your beak shut.

477
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,570
- 带上螳螂 - 什么 因为我插嘴...
- And take Mantis. - What? Oh man, is it because I ...?

478
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,810
对
Yes.

479
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,740
吃点东西吗
Oh, lunch break?

480
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,170
你不用同样问题问两遍
You don't need to ask me twice.

481
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,170
- 老爸 - 干嘛
- Dad? - Yes?

482
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,130
- 老爸 - 啥
- Dad? - Yes?

483
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,720
你在这里干什么
- What are you doing here?

484
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,110
你说我在干什么 我背疼死了
- What am I doing? Getting a backache.

485
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,080
你非得在每块石头上踩着走吗
Did you have to step on every rock?

486
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,610
- 不 我是说你怎么在这 - 那你说我该怎么办
- No, I mean why are you here? - What was I supposed to do?

487
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,820
如果你不喜欢吃那些熊猫的东西怎么办
What if the pandas don't have food you like?

488
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,870
你饿着肚子的话 怎么去拯救世界呀
You're never gonna be able to save the world on an empty stomach.

489
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,290
我觉得我跟着你攸关成败
I consider my presence mission critical.

490
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,790
关于这点 我们不能告诉外人村庄的位置
Oh yes about that. We can't share the location of the village with others.

491
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,070
- 所以... - 你认为我守不住秘密 是吧
- So... - Well, you think I can't keep a secret, huh?

492
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,510
我养了阿宝二十年才告诉他 他不是我亲生的
I raised Po for 20 years before I finally told him he was adopted.

493
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,390
- 真的吗 - 真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

494
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,250
好吧 我想 让你飞回去是有点残忍
Okay, I guess it would be cruel to make you fly back.

495
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,060
- 你竟然会飞 - 鹅也是鸟好吗 阿宝
- You can fly? - I'm a bird, Po.

496
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,350
我们到了
We're here.

497
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,950
看上去还要很长一段路
Sure looks like a long ways up there.

498
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,710
我儿子最讨厌爬阶梯了 我们还是回家吧
And my son hates stairs. So, let's go home.

499
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,240
我们可是熊猫 我们才不爬阶梯
We're pandas. We don't do stairs.

500
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,240
我一辈子都在等着这句话
I've waited my whole life to hear those words.

501
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,110
扯淡
Rats.

502
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,180
这就是神秘熊猫村 难怪你们要保密
This is the secret panda village? No wonder you keep it a secret.

503
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,080
如果我住在这 我也不好意思告诉别人
If I lived here, I wouldn't tell anyone either.

504
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,560
现在你可以"哇"了
Now you can whoa.

505
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,560
李山 大家注意 李山回来了
Li? Everyone, Li is back.

506
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,710
- 回来了两个人 - 他找到儿子了

512
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,310
- 他成功了 - 为什么我们要跑

- 他做到了 - 李山回来了

- He's so handsome. Just like his father. - Thank you.

519
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,840

Son, these are your cousins. Dim and Sum.

520

521
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,440

522
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,280

That's right.

523
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,030

- 很高兴见到你 嗨 - 其实我不认识你
- So, that's nice to see you. Hi. - I don't know who you are.

526

花娃娃 好漂亮啊
Stripey baby So beautiful.

527
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,570
小心点 那是我的人偶
Okay, careful with that. That's my action figure.

528
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,600

Can I keep her?

529
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,420
- 不 - 行吗
- Noooo... - Can I?

530
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,010
没...问题 当然没问题 我带来就是要送给你的
No....problem. Of course, yeah that's why I brought her.

531
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,470
- 好好照顾她 - 肯定会 花娃娃
- Take good care of her. - Yes, stripey baby

532
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,340
你看起来就像婴儿版的我
You look just like me but a baby.

569

584

就算你说"之翼"什么的
Just because you say "Wings of......"

585
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,440
也不代表你的动作有多特别
before something it doesn't mean that you're doing a special move.

586
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,230
就好像我说"强力之刃"或者
It's like me saying, "Antenna of power" or....
