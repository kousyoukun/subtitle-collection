00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,313
Maybe you've got the motor flooded.

00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,751
What do I do about it?

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,448

00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:31,304
I saw you. Wondered why you were alone.

I don't know. I don't think
you're getting any spark.

23

Yeah, I think you ought to
have a mechanic look at it.

There's an all-night garage on Normandie.

What do you want? Another
three days with her?

105
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,511
I didn't ask for the first three.

106
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,984
Okay, Paul. We've been
drawing blanks here, too.

You can have more time
with her if you need it.

Oh? Why?

110

spend a lot of time at my place,

111

never at hers.

112
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,855
She obviously has a generous friend

113
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,296
who's not around at the moment.

114
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,334
Last night, when I tried to
take her to the Lombardy Club,

115
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,732
she backed off.

PADDY: What's the connection?

117
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,562
It's one of Wheeler's hangouts.

118

You think that's enough to go on?

119

Don't you?

120
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:37,909
It'll have to do.

121
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,740
Harris, bring in that layout.

122
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,774
Oh, what about the girl?

123
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,606
I told her I was going to
be out of town for a while.

124
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,946
Oh, I got this from the bank
yesterday. It's the official count.

125
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:51,047
$210,000, and no record
of the serial numbers.

126
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,119
This is a layout of the
building the girl lives in.

127
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,559
This is her apartment here.

128
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,529
We'll take over this one across the way.

129
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:00,862
Be sure you avoid contact
with the rest of the tenants.

130
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,799
There'll be two men in
this room at all times,

131
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,337
one on the phone tap,
the other at the window.

132
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,771
Another man will be in the
lookout car out in front.

133
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,104
If Wheeler shows, the man in
the lookout car phones upstairs

134
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,507
and the other two will be ready for him

135
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,238
when he steps out of the elevator.

136
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:15,670
- Sounds real simple.
- It is.

137
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:18,683
If you ask me, Wheeler's
halfway to Peru right now.

138
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,413
All that dough and a
murder rap hanging over him.

139
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:25,753
Look, get it out of your
head that Wheeler won't show.

140
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:29,061
This is all we've got to go on,
and I want you expecting him.

141
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,153
Did you ever read the
statistics on bank jobs, Paddy?

142
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:33,831
Ever hear of a heist man being picked up

143
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,994
afterward on a highway
or international border?

144
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,900
They find them holed up in the big city.

145
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,168
How about it, Paul?

146
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,108
Think Wheeler will be around?

147
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,770
Yeah, he'll be around.

148
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:51,512
Everything straight then?

149
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:53,445
How about those back doors? They kept locked?

150
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,419
They can't be opened from the outside.

151
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:57,388
You'll be in charge of the stakeout, Paul.

152
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,220
And you know what I want.

153
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,852
You want Wheeler. I want him alive.

154
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,756
Remember that, all of you.

155
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:07,059
Dead, he can't tell us where the
money is or who his partner was.

156
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,567
Alive, he can save us a lot of dirty work.

157
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,037
What watch shall we take?

158
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,226
The important one.

159
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,637
I'm putting Briggs, Fine
and Corrick on the day watch.

160
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:17,267
Doesn't figure that Wheeler'll
show up in broad daylight.

161
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,503
Well, I guess that's everything.

162
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,478
Pick yourself up a copy of this from Harris.

163
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,478
Paul...

164
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,720
Keep your eye on Paddy.

165
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,189
I'd like to see him get his pension.

166
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,517
And he won't if he slips again.

167
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,519
Find Briggs and send him in to me.

168
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,105
Paul, Rick. Hiya, boys.

169
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,444
BRIGGS: Been a long afternoon.
Anything doing?

170
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:37,847
She went out once. Briggs tailed her.

171
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,475
BRIGGS: She took her car
around for a lube job.

172
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,644
- Might mean something.
- She's waiting for someone all right.

173
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,018
Doesn't know what to do with herself.

174
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,148
Smoked a pack of cigarettes
in the past two hours.

175
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,623
Coffee if you want it. Thanks.

176
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:48,626
All the comforts of home. She get any calls?

177
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:49,956
Nope. Everything's in the log there.

178
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,462
- BRIGGS: Have fun.
- RICK: See you.

179
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,590
At 7.00 a.m. Yeah.

180
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,298
2:46, called in for...

181
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:59,605
(CHUCKLES) For nothing.

182
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:02,864
- PAUL: Have you got her?
- Uh-huh.

183
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,711
PAUL: What do you think?

184
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,107
You're right. He'll be around.

185
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,410
To me she's still a babe,
like 30 million others.

186
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:40,042
Want me to take the phone?

187
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:41,944
No, I'll take it.

188
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,223
She's going to make a call.

189
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:08,265
(PHONE DIALING)

190
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:18,175
New car, mink coat, and
no clocks in the joint.

191
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:19,912
Probably the story of her life.

192
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,816
You just don't like women, Rick.

193
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,479
What keeps you single?

194
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:25,023
Maybe I like them too much.

195
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,219
We've seen all kinds
since we joined the force.

196
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:31,923
B-girls, hustlers, blackmailers,
shoplifters, drunks.

197
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:33,660
You know I think I'd still get married,

198
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,496
if I could find a half-honest woman.

199
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:36,963
Must be a few around.

200
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,231
Watch yourself. Those
few might just be smarter.

201
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,376
I don't know what makes a dame like
that tie up with a guy like Wheeler.

202
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,438
Money. What else?

203
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:50,215
She's scared. Scared of being
hungry and scared of being alone.

204
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,816
You can wrap up her whole
life in that one word.

205
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,182
Money? Hmm.

206
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,312
It's nice, but it doesn't
make the world go round.

207
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:57,515
Doesn't it?

208
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,818
Do you know anybody that's happily married

209
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,119
that hasn't got plenty of it?

210
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,184
My old man was. And he had to
stand the wolf off all his life.

211
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:06,129
Yeah, my folks hated each other.

212
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,495
Fighting all the time.

213
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,163
It's about the only thing
I can remember about them.

214
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,033
One long, endless quarrel.

215
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,469
And always about money.

216
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:15,764
Never about anything but money.

217
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,046
When I was a kid, I promised
myself that when I grew up,

218
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,341
I'd have plenty of dough.

219
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:24,310
Plenty of it.

220
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,451
I'm doing all right.

221
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,283
I owe the China-man $2.30
on last week's laundry bill.

222
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,152
How'd we get on to this?

223
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:33,953
I think I made a nasty crack about women.

224
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,164
Paul, she's going out.

225
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,531
I'll take it.

226
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:40,879
Change your mind about going out of town?

227
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:42,045
Yeah.

228
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,091
I took my car to have it serviced today.

229
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,730
Happened to mention the
trouble I had with it,

230
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,931
so the mechanic looked at the distributor.

231
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,400
He said it hasn't been touched in months.

232
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:09,879
My car didn't start the other night
because you did something to it.

233
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,041
Why?

234
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,346
Can't think of a fast answer?

235
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,882
Yeah, I can think of an answer.

236
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,121
I saw you walk into the theater.

237
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,228
I liked the way you walked.

238
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,421
As simple as that?

239
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:27,557
Sure, why not?

240
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,157
You're a liar.

241
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:31,463
You're also a cop.

242
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,200
You need a drink.

243
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,505
What do the police want from me?

244
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,701
I wouldn't know.

245
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:41,938
Harry wanted me to keep an eye on you.

246
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:44,509
Harry? Wheeler.

247
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,748
He's a friend of mine.

248
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,912
Harry Wheeler has no friends.

249
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,022
He did me a favor once.

250
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,058
And you returned it.

251
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:57,924
He didn't do me that big a favor.

252
00:21:58,497 --> 00:21:59,862
So you're a friend of Harry's?

253
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,126
That's right.

254
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,661
From St. Louis.

255
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:05,333
He dreamed up a pet name for me.

256
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,735
He did that for a lot of girls.

257
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,774
He never called me anything else.

258
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,103
What was it?

259
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,674
He was kind of nervous when
I talked to him on the phone.

260
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:17,341
He gave me your name and address, that's all.

261
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,508
A cop! A dirty, lying cop!

262
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:22,645
Wait a minute, baby, take
it easy. Take it easy.

263
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:37,502
These last few days,

264
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:40,602
they weren't all just cop, were they, Paul?

265
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:41,765
No.

266
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:45,608
No, I learned everything I
wanted to know that first night.

267
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:48,578
I went on seeing you because I wanted to.

268
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:51,572
But it's over.

269
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:55,779
What happens now?

270
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,755
I'm taking you downtown.

271
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,287
A man named Eckstrom wants
to ask you some questions.

272
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:04,824
Well,

273
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:07,989
it's been weird knowing you.

274
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:11,836
Not that it matters, Paul,

275
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,202
but I didn't know that Harry was

276
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,173
what he is.

277
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,769
He told me he owned
apartment houses in St. Louis.

278
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,812
He buy you that coat?

279
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,143
Yes.

280
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:36,026
Who was his partner?

281
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,156
Partner? Yeah, there
were two on that bank job.

282
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,096
We only identified Wheeler.

283
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,259
I told you he didn't have any friends.

284
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:46,231
I met him at a nightclub on
the Strip. He came in alone.

285
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:48,539
He was always alone if he wasn't with me.

286
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,870
And you let him set up house for you?

287
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:53,772
All right.

288
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:56,076
He bought me my clothes and my car

289
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,207
and a lease on a decent place to live in.

290
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,349
Things I've never had in my whole life.

291
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:04,879
If you'd known where his dough came from,

292
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:06,515
would you still have taken it?

293
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,252
Money isn't dirty. Just people.

294
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:14,028
How's he getting in touch with you?

295
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,461
He'd be crazy to try and you know it. Why?

296
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:18,696
It was just a lucky break
that we got a line on you.

297
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,602
He probably figures you're clear.

298
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:22,368
Maybe he will try.

299
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,008
I suppose my phone's tapped.

300
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:31,016
What happens to Harry if he's caught?

301
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,710
He killed a man.

302
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,352
And the $200,000?

303
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,054
What do you think?

304
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,855
I think it's a lot of money.

305
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,987
And right now Harry's got it.

306
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,564
That's right.

307
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,160
Paul...

308
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:51,801
Go on home.

309
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:53,869
Why? I wouldn't know.

310
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,203
Go on before I start thinking about it.

311
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,918
I don't want to go, Paul.

312
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,551
Not yet.

313
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,499
We could have that money, Paul, you and I.

314
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,737
Look, Harry's going to
die no matter what we do.

315
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:31,776
So what difference will it make
if he shows up and he's killed?

316
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:34,906
Be a perfect set-up for a cop, wouldn't it?

317
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:38,539
I could knock him off, hide the
money and call the meat wagon.

318
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:41,381
No questions asked.

319
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:43,885
Think what that money could mean to us, Paul.

320
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,651
To you and me.

321
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,320
And I thought I was using you.

322
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,924
Get out.

323
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:54,660
Get out!

324
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,740
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

325
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,167
RICK: Where'd she go?

326
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:46,234
Just drove around, going no place.

327
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:48,839
Might have been trying to
make a contact or something.

328
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:51,316
She looks a little frustrated at that.

329
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,179
Should one of us go down and relieve Paddy?

330
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,078
Hey, you with me? What?

331
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,952
I thought one of us ought
to go down and relieve Paddy.

332
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,389
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

333
00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:02,890
What's she doing?

334
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:06,124
Hanging drapes. Oh, you mean Wheeler's dame.

335
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,393
She's sitting over there staring at the wall.

336
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,135
There's a little nurse
next door. Always busy.

337
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,267

- RICK: What's holding you up?</i>

341
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:54,062
Where are you?

342
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,163
At the bowling alley. Where else?

343
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,004
Don't tell me you forgot about it?

344
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,907
I'm sorry, Rick, I did forget about it.

345
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:02,503
I woke up this morning with a fat headache.

346
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,014
I think I'd better skip it today, huh?

347
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,373
Sure.

348
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,441
Brew yourself some thick black
coffee. I'll see you tonight.

349
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,178
Right.

350
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:20,392
PADDY: Why don't you sit down?

351
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:21,830
Give your feet a rest.

352
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,094
I'm all right.

Are you?

354
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,669
What do you mean by that?

355
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:30,139
You've been looking kind of
bad the last couple of nights.

356

kids in the neighborhood.

double shot, and wham, I'm asleep.

359
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:41,285
I'll have to try that.

360
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,315
Why don't you go down and relieve Rick?

361
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:46,221
Right.

Please. Thanks a lot for the ride
home, but I've got to get upstairs.

MAN: But what's your hurry?
It's early yet.

I'm awfully tired. Uh, thanks anyway.

366
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:50,187
Now wait a minute.

Look, why don't you go up
and get out of that uniform,

368
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,020
and we'll go out and have a drink some place.

369

Some other time. Good night. No.

370
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,553
Now just a minute. Give me back my purse.

371
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:58,220
I'll give it to you when you come down. Okay?

372
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,695
Now you're being very childish. Give it back.

373
00:31:59,764 --> 00:32:00,856
No, you're not going to get it. Hey.

374
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,331
No, I said.

375
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:04,993
Forget it. It's not worth
it. Now wait a minute.

376
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,469
You're going to come down...
The lady said good night.

377
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:07,937
I guess you didn't hear.

378
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:11,769
Why don't you mind your own business, buddy?

379
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,437
Now give the lady back
her purse and take a walk.

380
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:17,241
Look, chum, I don't think it's any of your...

381
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,644
Be a nice fellow and catch yourself some air.

382
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:29,187
Thank you. Very much.

383
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:30,626
It was a pleasure.

384
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:36,358
You did that like... As if
you'd done it before a few times.

385
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:39,267
I was a bouncer once, a long time ago.

386
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,302
Maybe I should learn how it's done.

387
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,102
It might come in handy.

388
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:45,541
Wouldn't it be simpler
just to avoid that type?

389
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,205
I really am grateful for what you did.

390
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,636
Never know for sure.
Some women like that kind.

391
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,338
Oh, well I don't.

392
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,037
Not that it matters, but I
didn't have a date with him.

393
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:26,982
I'm a nurse, and he goes with a
friend of mine at the hospital.

394
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:30,112
He offered me a lift home, and
I made a mistake and accepted it.

395
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:32,247
You don't have to explain it to me.

396
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,924
Oh, no, it's just that I...

397
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,328
I guess I didn't want you
to have a bad opinion of me.

398
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:38,623
Don't ask me why.

399
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,028
All right, I won't.

400
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:43,096
Shouldn't I offer you a
cup of coffee or something?

401
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,829
It seems the least I could do.

402

After you learn that hammer lock.

403

I won't need it. My roommate hasn't left yet.

00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,101
She's a nurse, too. Night shift.

405
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:51,974
Maybe some other time.

406
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:55,472
Oh. All right. Well, good night.

Take the stairs and go up on
the roof. I want to talk to you.

410

Right now. Don't even
bother to finish that drink.

411
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,697
Sorry for the delay. I got tied up.

going out. I'll take her.

see you, wanting you to call me.

00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:23,283

Tomorrow? That soon?

425
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,167
You've got to stop him.

426
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,471
How? I don't know where he is.

427
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:40,909
Well, he'll call first, won't he?

428
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,241
Yes, but he... Well then, stall him.

And don't answer your
phone unless I'm on the tap.

Paul, will you listen to me?

431

It doesn't matter if anyone hears.

432
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,978
Harry told me exactly
what to say when he calls.

What did he tell you to say?

436
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:03,461
When he calls, he'll ask me
what TV program I'm looking at.

437
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:06,065
If everything is clear, I'll
say I'm not looking at TV.

Yes, and that's it.

He'll show up here 10 or 15 minutes later.

Here? Do you think he'll
have the money with him?

Yes.

Can't you tell him to
meet you someplace else?

444
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,745
No! If I say anything but what he
told me to say, it's a signal to run.

445

He'll show up right after he calls?

- clear.

be there to take the call.

I'll be right behind you.

No.

00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:26,769
half a dozen times.

486
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,311
FINE: She just ignored it.

487
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,415
- How'd she react?
- Couldn't tell. She was in the bedroom.

488
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,074
Maybe she knows her phone is tapped.

489
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,382
You're sure she wasn't in
the shower or something?

490
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,149
Just stood in the bedroom
and stared at the phone.

491
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,247
Almost hate to leave.

492
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,724
This may be the big night.

493
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:44,284
Yeah. I can hardly tear myself away.

494
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:45,895
Well, enjoy the view.

495
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,296
We'll see you. Good night.

496
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:52,459
If that call was supposed to mean something,

497
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:54,334
she isn't showing it.

498
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,302
RICK: Probably her roommate's party.

499
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,276
Must be her night off or something.

500
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:09,206
PAUL: How do you know it isn't her party?

501
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,679
She's tired.

502
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:13,717
I saw her come home
tonight, and she was beat.

503
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,651
You'd never know it to look at her now.

504
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,926
Well, this thing will
probably go on all night.

505
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,431
What do you care?

506
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:28,587
I don't.

508
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:36,200
Maybe I do. I find myself watching
her like I was her father or something.

509
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,008
I wait for her to come home.

510
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:40,601
When she's late, I worry about her,

511
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:42,578
wonder what she's doing.

512
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:46,807
And, uh, who she's doing
it with. Is that the idea?

513
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:50,015
Yeah, something like that.

514
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,182
At least I feel I know her well enough to...

The effects from... I'm sorry,
Paul, but all I did was...

00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:45,925
I know. We'll talk about it later.

No! No, Rick's not up there.

The girl went out. He's tailing her.

00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,183
Then what'll we do?

Well?

00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:15,650
When he finds out she's not up there,

557
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,717
he may get scared and run.

If he doesn't, we'll go up
and take him there. Come on.

Eckstrom don't need to know
about what happened, does he?

What? Eckstrom.

561
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:42,748
Does he have to know about...

562
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,145
If nothing goes wrong, no.

563
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:08,337
I don't want to lose my pension, Paul.

564
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
But I

565
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,711
guess you'll do what you got to do.

566
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:16,878
I'll give you every break I can.

567
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:19,449
If you'd been on the job, I'd
have taken him at the elevator,

568
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:21,548
the way Eckstrom wanted it.

569
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,593
You better hope nothing goes wrong.

570

Hold it, Wheeler! I got him!

Where? Downtown.

573
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:54,191
But first we'll pick up the money, huh?

574
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:56,690
You got it in your car?

575
00:46:57,762 --> 00:46:59,662
Let's go find out, huh?

576
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:50,710
This it? Yeah.

577
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:52,476
Locked? Yeah.

578
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,313
Let's have the keys.

Looks like the whole bundle.

580
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:13,261
What'd you do with your
partner, Wheeler? Kill him?

581
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:16,436
Okay, Paddy, close the satchel.

582
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:27,243
PADDY: What happened?
He jumped you. What else?

583
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:28,683
Why'd you shoot him? I
could have handled him.

584
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:31,687
Why, you're half-drunk. For
all I knew he had your gun.

585
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,215
Well, what now? I don't know.

586
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:37,420
Eckstrom will crucify
us. He wanted him alive.

587
00:48:37,495 --> 00:48:39,053
There'll only be one goat.

588
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,222
Me.

589
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:41,464
No.

590
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:44,561
No, there's a way out. Give me a hand, Paddy.

591
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:47,331
What're you doing? I'm saving your skin.

592
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,703
Tomorrow, I'll drive the
car someplace and leave it.

593
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:55,836
They'll find it and we'll be in the clear.

594
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:58,177
All we have to do is keep our mouths shut.

595
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:00,111
What's the gimmick?

596
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,252
Gimmick? You doing all this for me?

597
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:05,015
Why not?

598
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,653
I don't know.

599
00:49:07,158 --> 00:49:09,786
But I'd rather lose my pension than...

600
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:14,628
When they find Wheeler, will
they find that money, too?

601
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:17,127
What kind of a crack is that?

602
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:18,832
Maybe I'd better call Eckstrom right now?

603
00:49:18,903 --> 00:49:20,165
I gotta know, Paul.

604
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:21,431
I gotta know the money will be there.

605
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,268
Sure, it will be there!

606
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:25,408
Then give me the keys.

607
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:28,304
We'll both drive the car away tomorrow.

608
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,979
Okay, Paddy.

609
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:33,306
You keep them.

610
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,242
We'd better get back.

611
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:20,852

- Same as hers.

She made a call from the Twilight

- Our man's in town.

646
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:07,584
Spotted in a drug store on the
east side earlier this evening.

647
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:09,423
I'd hoped you might have him here for me.

648
00:54:09,493 --> 00:54:10,983
Well, we'd hoped the same thing.

649
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:12,653
I'm afraid I haven't.

650
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:13,855
Why not?

651
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,694
The dame acts like she
knows her phone's tapped.

652
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,324
Made a call from a bar tonight.

653
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:19,301
Probably touted him off.

654
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,201
Then you've been here alone.

655
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:23,205
For the last hour, yeah.

656
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:24,604
All quiet?

657
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,939
Her phone rang once. That's all.

658
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:31,009
Check the neighborhood, Sheridan.

659
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:33,106
Parked cars, alleys.

660
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:34,343
I'll wait here a while.

661
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:35,745
Right.

662
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:49,864
What time did you leave
tonight, Rick, to tail her?

663
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:51,195
About 10:30.

664
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:53,733
What time did you get back?

665
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:55,737
A minute ago. Why?

666
00:54:56,373 --> 00:55:00,275
I phoned here a half dozen
times between 10:50 and 11:15.

667
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,741
No answer.

668
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,406
Some thing from the car parked outside.

669
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:08,641
I gave him a chance to
explain. Why didn't he?

670
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:11,777
Talk to Paddy?

671
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:14,986
He had nothing to offer either.

672
00:55:15,058 --> 00:55:16,889
But he's scared to death.

673
00:55:17,895 --> 00:55:20,887
You and Sheridan are
fairly close, aren't you?

674
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:22,497
That's right.

675
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:24,625
But I'm not trying to cover for him.

676
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:27,499
Maybe Paul's trying to do it for Dolan.

677
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:28,833
Why?

678
00:55:28,906 --> 00:55:30,066
Why not ask Dolan?

679
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,765
I'm asking you. And I want an answer.

680
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,571
When I followed her I
drove past the lookout car.

681
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:37,807
Paddy wasn't in it.

682
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:39,743
When I got to the intersection,

683
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:42,451
I saw him go into a bar.

684
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:46,281
I guess that bar was just a little too close.

685
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:58,791
Paul, we... Shut up and get back in the car.

686
00:56:06,944 --> 00:56:08,571
Eckstrom talk to you?

687
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:11,011
He knows something's up. What'd you tell him?

688
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,446
Nothing I didn't have to. He knew.

689
00:56:12,516 --> 00:56:14,746
He doesn't know anything.
He just thinks he does.

690
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:17,548
He gave me a phony job
to get me out of the room.

691
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:19,420
Give me the keys to Wheeler's car.

692
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,287
I'll get it out of here while
we've still got a chance.

693
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:23,917
Come on! Give me the keys!

694
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,485
We're only making things worse, Paul.

695
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:28,697
I'm goin' up and tell Eckstrom
just the way it happened.

696
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:30,357
You're not going to tell him anything.

697
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,231
I'm in this, too, remember?

698
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:33,528
Why?

699
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:35,896
You were just coverin' for me.

700
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:37,804
Isn't that right? And
Eckstrom'll throw the book at me.

701
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:41,103
- Who do you think you're kiddin'?
- You'll come out sweet as a rose.

702
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:43,576
A hero for trying to protect a buddy.

703
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:46,207
Look, Paddy, Eckstrom can't prove a thing.

704
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:48,312
Why throw away your pension?

705
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:51,821
Because I spent 25 years
being a dumb, honest cop.

706
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:55,314
And I'm stuck with it. Wait a minute.

707
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:01,263
What's the idea?

708
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:03,265
You didn't do anything for me.

709
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,630
You're after that dough.

710
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:08,102
That's why you came down looking for me.

711
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:10,603
You knew Wheeler was going to show.

712
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:12,265
Now wait a minute, Paddy.

713
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,469
Nope. We're both going up
and tell it just like it...

714
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:16,102
(PHONE RINGING)

715
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:18,244
(GUN FIRING)

716
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:23,318
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

717
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,882
Doesn't answer. Come on.

718
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:35,155
Tell 'em to get here as fast
as they can, but no sirens.

719
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,284
And keep this from the press boys!

720
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:47,059
I heard a shot!

721
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:50,433
Paddy?

722
00:58:54,444 --> 00:58:55,536
Dead?

723
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:58,606
Rick, get those people back to bed.

724
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:01,315
We don't want a crowd around here.

725
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:02,778
RICK: All right, folks,
back on the sidewalk.

726
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:04,252
What's going on, officer? We heard the shot.

727
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:06,755
Just a slight accident.
Back on the sidewalk, please.

728
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:09,087
What do you think? I don't know.

729
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:11,093
Powder burns, his own gun.

730
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:12,628
Why would he kill himself?

731
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:14,357
I didn't say that.

732
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:16,023
Then you think he didn't?

733
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:27,266
Where were you tonight around 11:00?

734
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:30,277
- I was upstairs. Why?
- No, you weren't.

735
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:32,542
We know where Dolan was. Where were you?

736
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:34,276
You know where Dolan was?

737
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,080
McAllister saw him.

738
00:59:36,953 --> 00:59:38,978
I told him I'd cover for him.

739
00:59:39,256 --> 00:59:41,690
I tried to get him on the car
phone about 10:30, he didn't answer.

740
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:42,782
I know.

741
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:44,759
The operator gave me the message just now.

742
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:47,488
I came down to see what had happened to him.

743
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:49,497
Found he'd gone over to the bar.

744
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:52,091
He was scared. He kept
talking about his pension.

745
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:54,234
I brought him back here.

746
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:57,205
I tried to make him understand
I wouldn't say anything,

747
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:00,074
but I guess he wasn't listening.

748
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:03,470
Well, you'd better get back upstairs.

749
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:04,980
We've still got a job to do here.

750
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,140
Yeah.

751
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,725
There's not much point keeping
a stakeout now, is there?

752
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:17,917
You got any better ideas?

753
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:39,174
Yeah, right away.

754
01:00:40,283 --> 01:00:41,978
(WOMEN CHATTERING)

755
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:02,603
WOMAN: Oh, look, there's been an accident.

756
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:03,696
Wonder what happened?

757
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:06,130
- Wanna go over? Maybe you can help.
- No, they don't need us.

758
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,809
- They'd be the first to say so.
- Oh, it's so late.

759
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:10,141
Come on.

760
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,511
Are you sure you won't change
your mind and come with us, Ann?

761
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,739
- No, you all go on.
- All right. And have fun.

762
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:16,308
You know the Crockett's
number if you need me.

763
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:17,546
Oh, don't worry.

764
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:19,020
- WOMAN: Give us a call.
- All right. Bye.

765
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:21,353
Nighty night. Bye.

766
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:50,179
He's dead. I shot him.

767
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:51,277
What do you mean? Paddy Dolan.

768
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:52,514
What happened? I killed him.

769
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:54,079
The poor, dumb, harmless...

770
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:55,283
He pulled a gun on me.

771
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,155
It went off. It was an accident. I...

772
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:09,863
Are they after you? No.

773
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,237
But everything's gone wrong.

774
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:12,466
Paddy and...

775
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:13,600
And that girl downstairs,

776
01:02:13,677 --> 01:02:15,508
she saw me in your apartment. What girl?

777
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:17,603
The one that lives next to you. The nurse.

778
01:02:17,681 --> 01:02:19,478
Does she know who you are? I don't think so.

779
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:21,141
But she'll remember me.
She'll remember me good.

780
01:02:21,217 --> 01:02:22,775
Paul, look, we've got the
money. Why don't we get out now?

781
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:25,150
We haven't got the money! The car's gone.

782
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:27,189
How? Paddy must have moved it.

783
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:29,149
He couldn't have moved it far.

784
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:30,692
It must be around here someplace close.

785
01:02:31,695 --> 01:02:33,754
Maybe we could spot it from up here.

786
01:02:35,332 --> 01:02:37,527
McAllister's still down there.

787
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,901
You take that side. I'll look over here.

788
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:16,701
Go on upstairs, Rick.

789
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:19,807
Who tells Paddy's wife?

790
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:22,474
That goes with my job.

791
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,570
What are you going to say? He killed himself?

792
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:27,912
What else can I say?

793
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,950
Get those people out of there.

794
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:45,729
Anything serious?

795
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:47,694
No.

796
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:00,675
You know, you're a bitter
disappointment to me.

797
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,842
Oh?

798
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:03,509
The other night.

799
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:05,577
You were just doing your job.

800
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:08,884
You are a policeman, aren't you?

801
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,126
Paul!

802
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:23,096
PAUL: That's it.

803
01:04:23,173 --> 01:04:25,539
Go down to your apartment, stay
there a few minutes, and then leave.

804
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:27,633
I want the man that follows
you kept out at least an hour.

805
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,710
What are you going to do?

806
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:30,678
I'm going to put Wheeler's body
where it'll be found tonight.

807
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:32,237
Why? Why take any chance now?

808
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:34,078
Tomorrow we... I can't do
it in the broad daylight.

809
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,209
And if that girl sees me again, I'm through.

810
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:39,983
When they find the body, the stakeout
will be over and I'll be away from here.

811
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:44,183
Everything's going to
be all right? Sure. Sure.

812
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:51,095
You have a wonderful way
of sidestepping questions.

813
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,499
Shall I just stop asking them?

814
01:04:53,636 --> 01:04:55,160
Right now, yes.

815
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:57,729
But save them for next week.

816
01:04:58,374 --> 01:04:59,739
Next week?

817
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:02,342
You wouldn't be asking for a date?

818
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:04,545
I can't even answer that for sure.

819
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:06,582
Is your name in the book?

820
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,440
Ann Stewart, with a "W."

821
01:05:08,518 --> 01:05:09,644
But you'd better call me at the hospital.

822
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:11,414
After our party tonight, we may be evicted.

823
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:12,546
Was it that bad?

824
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:15,056
I didn't think so, but the
people next door apparently did.

825
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:16,284
People next door.

826
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,122
You don't mean 423?

827
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:20,588
Yes. Why not? What happened?

828
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:23,924
Well, nothing, really. I went over
to borrow some ice cubes from him.

829
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,195
Him? You mean her, don't you?

830
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:28,229
No, I mean him.

831
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,177
What time was it?

832
01:05:42,285 --> 01:05:44,583
Well, about 11:00.

833
01:05:45,155 --> 01:05:46,747
Is he important?

834
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:49,690
He may have killed a man
last week and another tonight.

835
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:58,492
Do you think you could recognize
him if you saw him again?

836
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:01,033
Yes. I think I could.

837
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:03,905
Then you'll be hearing from
me sooner than I thought.

838
01:06:03,973 --> 01:06:05,304
Good night.

839
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:19,044
Wheeler was here. In her apartment.

840
01:06:19,556 --> 01:06:22,047
When? When you were out looking for Paddy.

841
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:23,416
How'd you find out about it?

842
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:25,518
The nurse. She tried to
borrow some ice cubes.

843
01:06:25,595 --> 01:06:27,688
He gave her a fast brush-off.

844
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:29,162
223 please.

845
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,360
Mitchell?

846
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,197
When Eckstrom gets in, have him call me.

847
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:35,468
McAllister. Right.

848
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:37,933
Could she identify him?

849
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:39,975
Well, who else could it be?

850
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:41,704
What's the blonde doing?

851
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:43,211
The usual things.

852
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:45,975
If there's anybody in there
with her, she doesn't know it.

853
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:48,742
Do you think the nurse scared him off?

854
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:51,646
I don't know.

855
01:06:51,854 --> 01:06:53,583
She said he opened the
door before she knocked,

856
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:55,146
as if he was leaving.

857
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:57,290
Well, then when he found
out his girl wasn't up there,

858
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,384
he probably got nervous
and... That's just it.

859
01:06:58,461 --> 01:07:00,019
Why wasn't she?

860
01:07:00,296 --> 01:07:03,163
I can't spot it, but
something's wrong somewhere.

861
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,500
And what happened to Paddy,
that doesn't fit either.

862
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,038
Eckstrom must have scared
him out of his mind.

863
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,638
Do you really think Paddy killed himself?

864
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:15,803
If you were going to check out,
would you put a.38 slug in your belly?

865
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:17,470
Nobody kills himself like that.

866
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:19,014
Least of all a cop.

867
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,947
I know Paddy like I know my own self.

868
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:23,451
He wouldn't have done it. Not
that way, or any other way.

869
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,147
And he certainly wouldn't have
let Wheeler get that close.

870
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:27,553
Maybe he did.

871
01:07:27,624 --> 01:07:28,648
No.

872
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,187
You know what I think, Paul.

873
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,097
I think whoever killed Paddy was
right there in the car with him.

874
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:38,599
Sitting right there beside him.

She there?

She just came in. Where'd she go?

884
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:38,578
Nowhere. Anything happen over there?

885
01:10:38,648 --> 01:10:40,377
No, it's all quiet.

886
01:10:41,117 --> 01:10:42,846
Know where she went?

887
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,409
To the beach.

888
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:47,514
Looked at the water exactly three minutes,

889
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,387
came right back here.

890
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:52,283
- Why?
- It doesn't make sense.

891
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:54,022
Well, she probably figured
there's only one man

892
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:55,461
watching her place, wanted to draw him off.

893
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:56,725
Why? Nothing happened over there,

894
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:59,131
and Schaeffer didn't see anything outside.

895

Rick, you'd better come with me.

896

We've got work to do.

897
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,672
Wheeler's dead. What happened?

898
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:43,473
Two.38 slugs in the back.

899
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:44,945
Where? When?

900
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:48,575
Dumped out of a car on Third and
Wilmer, about a half an hour ago.

901
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:51,377
Doesn't she ever go to bed?

902
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:54,649

Who's Harry Wheeler?

He's been getting some
space in this week's papers.

928
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:49,562
I'm afraid I don't read the paper.

929
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:52,130
And I don't know anyone named Harry.

930
01:13:52,508 --> 01:13:55,477
Don't you have to know a man to
give him a key to your apartment?

What's that supposed to mean?

932

Harry Wheeler was in this
apartment tonight at 11:00.

I wasn't even here at 11:00.

No, you were at the Twilight Room.

But there was a man here.

01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:08,420
If it wasn't Wheeler, who was it?

937
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:11,258
If there was anyone here, he broke in.

What did Wheeler come up here for?

I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you, Lona.

945
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:30,209
Wheeler's partner double-crossed him,

946
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:32,839
which means he double-crossed you, too.

947
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:36,612
He shot Wheeler tonight and
dumped his body into the street.

Which means nothing to me.

Sheridan. Eckstrom there?

969
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:15,964
Well, you'd better go over and give him this.

an Ann Stewart, apartment 421.

972
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:22,236
She just called in.

973
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:24,745
Says she saw the man we're
after. Whatever that means.

974
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:27,441
Oh, and... Yeah, two more cars.

975
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:30,945
She mentioned McAllister,
so it may be a break.

976
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,419
Yeah, you never know.

977
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:34,283

Yes?

982
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:18,763
The police. Did you put in a call?

983
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:27,404
...no reason. When I can't sleep, I drive.

984
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:28,841
Who pays your rent?

985
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,310
I do! How?

986
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,438
What about the call you got from RTV?

987
01:19:32,514 --> 01:19:33,811
I don't know what you're talking about.

988
01:19:33,882 --> 01:19:35,747
It wasn't the rating service
that called. We checked on it.

989
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:37,285
Who was it?

990
01:19:37,353 --> 01:19:39,048
If there was a call, I don't remember it.

you want to be picked up

Sheridan?

1000
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,396
I guess he went downstairs.

Yeah.

Where's Sheridan? Upstairs.

1008
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:12,376
If he was upstairs I wouldn't
be asking you about him.

1009
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,813
Didn't he just give you a message?

1010
01:21:13,882 --> 01:21:15,213
What are you talking about? What message?

1011
01:21:15,284 --> 01:21:18,082
A woman called. Said she saw
the guy we're looking for.

1012
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:19,177
What was her name?

1013
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:20,881

just called in, they're all missing!

You and Schaeffer search
the building, top to bottom.

Who are we after?

1019

Maybe Paul Sheridan. Take a
prowl car and cover the back.

1020
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:36,053
What's wrong? A prowl car
right behind Wheeler's.

Do you think they know it's Harry's car?

I don't know.

1023
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:40,290
Maybe they just happened to park there.

1024
01:23:41,496 --> 01:23:43,862
There's one way to find out. Here,

1025
01:23:45,033 --> 01:23:47,331
that car over there,
here's the key to the trunk.

When I fire, get behind the car.

Duck!

1032
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:41,885
It's clear that way. Go to Western
and Wilshire, wait for me there.

1033
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:43,288
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get that car.

1034
01:24:43,358 --> 01:24:44,950
Now go on hurry! No, wait!
You can't get that money!

Will you go, Lona?
Please, don't try to get...
