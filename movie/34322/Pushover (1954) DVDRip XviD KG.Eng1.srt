1
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,609
Need some help?

2
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,313
Maybe you've got the motor flooded.

3
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:09,751
What do I do about it?

4
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,448
Want me to try?

5
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,124
All right.

6
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,726
Shove over.

7
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,932
Did you like the show?

8
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,164
Yeah.

9
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:27,839
How did you know I was there?

10
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:31,304
I saw you. Wondered why you were alone.

11
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,541
I wondered the same thing about you.

12
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:41,180
It doesn't seem to be flooded.

13
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:43,245
I'll take a look under the hood.

14
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:10,408
I don't know. I don't think
you're getting any spark.

15
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:13,380
I'm not?

16
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,284
Not enough to start the car.

17
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,680
Any suggestions?

18
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,620
Yeah, I think you ought to
have a mechanic look at it.

19
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,059
There's an all-night garage on Normandie.

20
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,358
You could call them from a bar over here.

21
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,130
All right.

22
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,031
I'd feel much better if you went with me.

23
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,141
That was the idea.

24
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:49,845
Another drink?

25
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,358
You could play the record again, though.

26
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,953
Okay.

27
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:58,897
Oh. Did you get it started?

28
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:00,262
Have to tow it in to the shop, ma'am.

29
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,960
I can't seem to locate the trouble.

30
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,427
How long will that take?

31
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,936
It's hard to say.

32
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:06,903
Could I call you here?

33
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,440
Bartender, what time do you close?

34
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,136
12:00.
We don't get much late trade.

35
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:12,936
All right. I guess we'll have to call you.

36
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,139
Okay.

37
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:16,713
Well...

38
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,585
You like to take me home?

39
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,144
Now?

40
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,548
Sure.

41
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,996
Your place or mine?

42
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,701
Surprise me.

43
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,603
Yeah.

44
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:51,043
Well, there's no particular hurry.

45
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,953
Well, why don't you check with
the mechanic and call me back?

46
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,948
Hollywood 33-449.

47
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,385
Right.

48
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:02,819
Mind?

49
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,557
No, help yourself.

50
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,102
That was with plain water, wasn't it?

51
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,404
Uh-huh.

52
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:23,175
Sorry?

53
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,442
Sorry? For what?

54
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:26,913
Picking me up.

55
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,653
Is that what you call it,
a pick-up?

56
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,054
Don't you?

57
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,083
Do you get picked up often?

58
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,486
Would you care?

59
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:45,163
If I said yes, it wouldn't
make much sense, would it?

60
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,163
No.

61
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,099
I guess it wouldn't.

62
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,176
The answer's yes.

63
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,221
Would it make any sense if I told
you it's never happened before?

64
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:09,688
Maybe.

65
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:25,571
Funny.

66
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:28,509
When I saw you come into
the theater tonight, I...

67
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,713
I thought how awful it was.

68
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,217
The two of us there all alone.

69
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,845
It doesn't make sense, a girl like you.

70
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,980
New car, mink coat.

71
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:39,514
- Perfume, $50 an ounce.
- It's $100.

72
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:42,318
Still alone. Why?

73
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:43,621
Uh-uh.

74
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,457
No questions. Don't spoil it.

75
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:51,062
Yeah.

76
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,672
How long will it take?

77
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,066
Wait a minute.

78
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,504
He says the distributor's shot.

79
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,945
Take a couple of hours,
maybe longer, to fix it.

80
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,374
He wants to know where to deliver it.

81
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,442
You tell him.

82
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:13,289
You can deliver it here. 3916
Crescent Way, apartment D.

83
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,587
Right.

84
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,748
We're doing the best we can.

85
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,787
After all, identifying Harry
Wheeler as one of the men

86
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,052
who knocked off the bank
was no break, it was...

87
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,023
Yes, sir.

88
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,093
All right, sir, as soon as I get it.

89
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,660
What about you, Rick?
Anything from St. Louis?

90
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,999
Wheeler was there till five
weeks ago. That's all we got.

91
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:00,096
Nothing on who he left with? Why he left?

92
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,970
They're working on it.

93
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,033
About time you showed.

94
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:06,135
Have you got anything for us?

95
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:07,736
Well, nothing definite, no.

96
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,748
What do you want? Another
three days with her?

97
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,511
I didn't ask for the first three.

98
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,984
Okay, Paul. We've been
drawing blanks here, too.

99
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,044
You can have more time
with her if you need it.

100
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:18,215
I'm satisfied she's Wheeler's girl.

101
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:19,718
Oh? Why?

102
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,090
Well, it seems to add up. We
spend a lot of time at my place,

103
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,185
never at hers.

104
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,855
She obviously has a generous friend

105
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,296
who's not around at the moment.

106
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,334
Last night, when I tried to
take her to the Lombardy Club,

107
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,732
she backed off.

108
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:30,893
What's the connection?

109
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,562
It's one of Wheeler's hangouts.

110
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,334
You think that's enough to go on?

111
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,874
Don't you?

112
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:37,909
It'll have to do.

113
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,740
Harris, bring in that layout.

114
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,774
Oh, what about the girl?

115
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,606
I told her I was going to
be out of town for a while.

116
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,946
Oh, I got this from the bank
yesterday. It's the official count.

117
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:51,047
$210,000, and no record
of the serial numbers.

118
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,119
This is a layout of the
building the girl lives in.

119
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,559
This is her apartment here.

120
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,529
We'll take over this one across the way.

121
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:00,862
Be sure you avoid contact
with the rest of the tenants.

122
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,799
There'll be two men in
this room at all times,

123
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,337
one on the phone tap,
the other at the window.

124
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,771
Another man will be in the
lookout car out in front.

125
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,104
If Wheeler shows, the man in
the lookout car phones upstairs

126
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,507
and the other two will be ready for him

127
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,238
when he steps out of the elevator.

128
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:15,670
- Sounds real simple.
- It is.

129
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:18,683
If you ask me, Wheeler's
halfway to Peru right now.

130
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,413
All that dough and a
murder rap hanging over him.

131
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:25,753
Look, get it out of your
head that Wheeler won't show.

132
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:29,061
This is all we've got to go on,
and I want you expecting him.

133
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,153
Did you ever read the
statistics on bank jobs, Paddy?

134
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:33,831
Ever hear of a heist man being picked up

135
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,994
afterward on a highway
or international border?

136
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,900
They find them holed up in the big city.

137
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,168
How about it, Paul?

138
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,108
Think Wheeler will be around?

139
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,770
Yeah, he'll be around.

140
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:51,512
Everything straight then?

141
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:53,445
How about those back doors? They kept locked?

142
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,419
They can't be opened from the outside.

143
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:57,388
You'll be in charge of the stakeout, Paul.

144
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,220
And you know what I want.

145
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,852
You want Wheeler. I want him alive.

146
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,756
Remember that, all of you.

147
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:07,059
Dead, he can't tell us where the
money is or who his partner was.

148
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,567
Alive, he can save us a lot of dirty work.

149
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,037
What watch shall we take?

150
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,226
The important one.

151
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,637
I'm putting Briggs, Fine
and Corrick on the day watch.

152
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:17,267
Doesn't figure that Wheeler'll
show up in broad daylight.

153
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,503
Well, I guess that's everything.

154
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,478
Pick yourself up a copy of this from Harris.

155
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,478
Paul...

156
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,720
Keep your eye on Paddy.

157
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,189
I'd like to see him get his pension.

158
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,517
And he won't if he slips again.

159
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,519
Find Briggs and send him in to me.

160
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,105
Paul, Rick. Hiya, boys.

161
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,444
Been a long afternoon.
Anything doing?

162
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:37,847
She went out once. Briggs tailed her.

163
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,475
She took her car
around for a lube job.

164
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,644
- Might mean something.
- She's waiting for someone all right.

165
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,018
Doesn't know what to do with herself.

166
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,148
Smoked a pack of cigarettes
in the past two hours.

167
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,623
Coffee if you want it. Thanks.

168
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:48,626
All the comforts of home. She get any calls?

169
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:49,956
Nope. Everything's in the log there.

170
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,462
Have fun.
See you.

171
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,590
At 7.00 a.m. Yeah.

172
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,298
2:46, called in for...

173
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:59,605
For nothing.

174
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:02,864
Have you got her?
- Uh-huh.

175
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,711
What do you think?

176
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,107
You're right. He'll be around.

177
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,410
To me she's still a babe,
like 30 million others.

178
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:40,042
Want me to take the phone?

179
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:41,944
No, I'll take it.

180
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,223
She's going to make a call.

181
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:18,175
New car, mink coat, and
no clocks in the joint.

182
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:19,912
Probably the story of her life.

183
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,816
You just don't like women, Rick.

184
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,479
What keeps you single?

185
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:25,023
Maybe I like them too much.

186
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,219
We've seen all kinds
since we joined the force.

187
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:31,923
B-girls, hustlers, blackmailers,
shoplifters, drunks.

188
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:33,660
You know I think I'd still get married,

189
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,496
if I could find a half-honest woman.

190
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:36,963
Must be a few around.

191
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,231
Watch yourself. Those
few might just be smarter.

192
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,376
I don't know what makes a dame like
that tie up with a guy like Wheeler.

193
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,438
Money. What else?

194
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:50,215
She's scared. Scared of being
hungry and scared of being alone.

195
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,816
You can wrap up her whole
life in that one word.

196
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,182
Money? Hmm.

197
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,312
It's nice, but it doesn't
make the world go round.

198
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:57,515
Doesn't it?

199
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,818
Do you know anybody that's happily married

200
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,119
that hasn't got plenty of it?

201
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,184
My old man was. And he had to
stand the wolf off all his life.

202
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:06,129
Yeah, my folks hated each other.

203
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,495
Fighting all the time.

204
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,163
It's about the only thing
I can remember about them.

205
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,033
One long, endless quarrel.

206
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,469
And always about money.

207
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:15,764
Never about anything but money.

208
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,046
When I was a kid, I promised
myself that when I grew up,

209
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,341
I'd have plenty of dough.

210
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:24,310
Plenty of it.

211
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,451
I'm doing all right.

212
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,283
I owe the China-man $2.30
on last week's laundry bill.

213
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,152
How'd we get on to this?

214
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:33,953
I think I made a nasty crack about women.

215
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,164
Paul, she's going out.

216
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,531
I'll take it.

217
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:40,879
Change your mind about going out of town?

218
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:42,045
Yeah.

219
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,091
I took my car to have it serviced today.

220
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,730
Happened to mention the
trouble I had with it,

221
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,931
so the mechanic looked at the distributor.

222
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,400
He said it hasn't been touched in months.

223
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:09,879
My car didn't start the other night
because you did something to it.

224
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,041
Why?

225
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,346
Can't think of a fast answer?

226
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,882
Yeah, I can think of an answer.

227
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,121
I saw you walk into the theater.

228
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,228
I liked the way you walked.

229
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,421
As simple as that?

230
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:27,557
Sure, why not?

231
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,157
You're a liar.

232
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:31,463
You're also a cop.

233
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,200
You need a drink.

234
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,505
What do the police want from me?

235
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,701
I wouldn't know.

236
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:41,938
Harry wanted me to keep an eye on you.

237
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:44,509
Harry? Wheeler.

238
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,748
He's a friend of mine.

239
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,912
Harry Wheeler has no friends.

240
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,022
He did me a favor once.

241
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,058
And you returned it.

242
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:57,924
He didn't do me that big a favor.

243
00:21:58,497 --> 00:21:59,862
So you're a friend of Harry's?

244
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,126
That's right.

245
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,661
From St. Louis.

246
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:05,333
He dreamed up a pet name for me.

247
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,735
He did that for a lot of girls.

248
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,774
He never called me anything else.

249
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,103
What was it?

250
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,674
He was kind of nervous when
I talked to him on the phone.

251
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:17,341
He gave me your name and address, that's all.

252
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,508
A cop! A dirty, lying cop!

253
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:22,645
Wait a minute, baby, take
it easy. Take it easy.

254
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:37,502
These last few days,

255
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:40,602
they weren't all just cop, were they, Paul?

256
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:41,765
No.

257
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:45,608
No, I learned everything I
wanted to know that first night.

258
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:48,578
I went on seeing you because I wanted to.

259
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:51,572
But it's over.

260
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:55,779
What happens now?

261
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,755
I'm taking you downtown.

262
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,287
A man named Eckstrom wants
to ask you some questions.

263
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:04,824
Well,

264
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:07,989
it's been weird knowing you.

265
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:11,836
Not that it matters, Paul,

266
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,202
but I didn't know that Harry was

267
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,173
what he is.

268
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,769
He told me he owned
apartment houses in St. Louis.

269
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,812
He buy you that coat?

270
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,143
Yes.

271
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:36,026
Who was his partner?

272
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,156
Partner? Yeah, there
were two on that bank job.

273
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,096
We only identified Wheeler.

274
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,259
I told you he didn't have any friends.

275
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:46,231
I met him at a nightclub on
the Strip. He came in alone.

276
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:48,539
He was always alone if he wasn't with me.

277
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,870
And you let him set up house for you?

278
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:53,772
All right.

279
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:56,076
He bought me my clothes and my car

280
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,207
and a lease on a decent place to live in.

281
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,349
Things I've never had in my whole life.

282
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:04,879
If you'd known where his dough came from,

283
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:06,515
would you still have taken it?

284
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,252
Money isn't dirty. Just people.

285
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:14,028
How's he getting in touch with you?

286
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,461
He'd be crazy to try and you know it. Why?

287
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:18,696
It was just a lucky break
that we got a line on you.

288
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,602
He probably figures you're clear.

289
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:22,368
Maybe he will try.

290
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,008
I suppose my phone's tapped.

291
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:31,016
What happens to Harry if he's caught?

292
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,710
He killed a man.

293
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,352
And the $200,000?

294
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,054
What do you think?

295
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,855
I think it's a lot of money.

296
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,987
And right now Harry's got it.

297
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,564
That's right.

298
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:50,160
Paul...

299
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:51,801
Go on home.

300
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:53,869
Why? I wouldn't know.

301
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,203
Go on before I start thinking about it.

302
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,918
I don't want to go, Paul.

303
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,551
Not yet.

304
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,499
We could have that money, Paul, you and I.

305
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,737
Look, Harry's going to
die no matter what we do.

306
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:31,776
So what difference will it make
if he shows up and he's killed?

307
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:34,906
Be a perfect set-up for a cop, wouldn't it?

308
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:38,539
I could knock him off, hide the
money and call the meat wagon.

309
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:41,381
No questions asked.

310
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:43,885
Think what that money could mean to us, Paul.

311
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,651
To you and me.

312
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,320
And I thought I was using you.

313
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,924
Get out.

314
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:54,660
Get out!

315
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,167
Where'd she go?

316
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:46,234
Just drove around, going no place.

317
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:48,839
Might have been trying to
make a contact or something.

318
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:51,316
She looks a little frustrated at that.

319
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,179
Should one of us go down and relieve Paddy?

320
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,078
Hey, you with me? What?

321
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,952
I thought one of us ought
to go down and relieve Paddy.

322
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,389
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

323
00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:02,890
What's she doing?

324
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:06,124
Hanging drapes. Oh, you mean Wheeler's dame.

325
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,393
She's sitting over there staring at the wall.

326
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:11,135
There's a little nurse
next door. Always busy.

327
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,267
Hasn't stopped moving for a minute.

328
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,298
<i>- Hello.
What's holding you up?</i>

329
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:54,062
Where are you?

330
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,163
At the bowling alley. Where else?

331
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,004
Don't tell me you forgot about it?

332
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,907
I'm sorry, Rick, I did forget about it.

333
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:02,503
I woke up this morning with a fat headache.

334
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,014
I think I'd better skip it today, huh?

335
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,373
Sure.

336
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,441
Brew yourself some thick black
coffee. I'll see you tonight.

337
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,178
Right.

338
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:20,392
Why don't you sit down?

339
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:21,830
Give your feet a rest.

340
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,094
I'm all right.

341
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:24,862
Are you?

342
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,669
What do you mean by that?

343
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:30,139
You've been looking kind of
bad the last couple of nights.

344
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,505
Trouble sleeping daytimes?

345
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:35,040
Yeah, yeah, the... So many
kids in the neighborhood.

346
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,416
The minute I get home, take a big
double shot, and wham, I'm asleep.

347
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:41,285
I'll have to try that.

348
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,315
Why don't you go down and relieve Rick?

349
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:46,221
Right.

350
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:42,004
But why can't I go up to the...

351
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,072
Please. Thanks a lot for the ride
home, but I've got to get upstairs.

352
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,947
But what's your hurry?
It's early yet.

353
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:49,111
I'm awfully tired. Uh, thanks anyway.

354
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:50,187
Now wait a minute.

355
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:51,654
Look, why don't you go up
and get out of that uniform,

356
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,020
and we'll go out and have a drink some place.

357
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:54,854
Some other time. Good night. No.

358
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,553
Now just a minute. Give me back my purse.

359
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:58,220
I'll give it to you when you come down. Okay?

360
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,695
Now you're being very childish. Give it back.

361
00:31:59,764 --> 00:32:00,856
No, you're not going to get it. Hey.

362
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,331
No, I said.

363
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:04,993
Forget it. It's not worth
it. Now wait a minute.

364
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,469
You're going to come down...
The lady said good night.

365
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:07,937
I guess you didn't hear.

366
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:11,769
Why don't you mind your own business, buddy?

367
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,437
Now give the lady back
her purse and take a walk.

368
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:17,241
Look, chum, I don't think it's any of your...

369
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,644
Be a nice fellow and catch yourself some air.

370
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:29,187
Thank you. Very much.

371
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:30,626
It was a pleasure.

372
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:36,358
You did that like... As if
you'd done it before a few times.

373
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:39,267
I was a bouncer once, a long time ago.

374
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,302
Maybe I should learn how it's done.

375
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,102
It might come in handy.

376
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:45,541
Wouldn't it be simpler
just to avoid that type?

377
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,205
I really am grateful for what you did.

378
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:19,636
Never know for sure.
Some women like that kind.

379
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,338
Oh, well I don't.

380
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,037
Not that it matters, but I
didn't have a date with him.

381
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:26,982
I'm a nurse, and he goes with a
friend of mine at the hospital.

382
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:30,112
He offered me a lift home, and
I made a mistake and accepted it.

383
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:32,247
You don't have to explain it to me.

384
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,924
Oh, no, it's just that I...

385
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,328
I guess I didn't want you
to have a bad opinion of me.

386
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:38,623
Don't ask me why.

387
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,028
All right, I won't.

388
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:43,096
Shouldn't I offer you a
cup of coffee or something?

389
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,829
It seems the least I could do.

390
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:46,734
After you learn that hammer lock.

391
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:48,329
I won't need it. My roommate hasn't left yet.

392
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,101
She's a nurse, too. Night shift.

393
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:51,974
Maybe some other time.

394
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:55,472
Oh. All right. Well, good night.

395
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,139
Good night.

396
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:39,786
This is Paul. I may have to hang up fast.

397
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:42,649
Take the stairs and go up on
the roof. I want to talk to you.

398
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:45,329
Right now. Don't even
bother to finish that drink.

399
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,697
Sorry for the delay. I got tied up.

400
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,635
It's all right. The girl's
going out. I'll take her.

401
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:45,515
Over here, Paul.

402
00:35:58,536 --> 00:35:59,764
You win.

403
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,802
Couldn't have taken much more,

404
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,244
wondering what was happening,

405
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:12,477
waiting for the phone to
ring and scared it might.

406
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:16,884
Thinking of you, wanting to
see you, wanting you to call me.

407
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,283
I know.

408
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:23,283
This isn't going to be easy.

409
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:25,922
We've got to keep our heads every second.

410
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,762
Your phone's tapped and there are
three men watching you day and night.

411
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:34,930
Harry's coming here. Maybe tomorrow.

412
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,974
Tomorrow? That soon?

413
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,167
You've got to stop him.

414
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,471
How? I don't know where he is.

415
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:40,909
Well, he'll call first, won't he?

416
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,241
Yes, but he... Well then, stall him.

417
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:43,974
And don't answer your
phone unless I'm on the tap.

418
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:45,572
Paul, will you listen to me?

419
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,810
It doesn't matter if anyone hears.

420
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,978
Harry told me exactly
what to say when he calls.

421
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:50,748
And if I say anything else, he won't...

422
00:36:59,164 --> 00:37:00,688
What did he tell you to say?

423
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:03,461
When he calls, he'll ask me
what TV program I'm looking at.

424
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:06,065
If everything is clear, I'll
say I'm not looking at TV.

425
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,570
You're not looking at TV.

426
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:09,372
Yes, and that's it.

427
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:11,375
He'll show up here 10 or 15 minutes later.

428
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:14,137
Here? Do you think he'll
have the money with him?

429
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:15,212
Yes.

430
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,941
Can't you tell him to
meet you someplace else?

431
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,745
No! If I say anything but what he
told me to say, it's a signal to run.

432
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:22,085
He'll show up right after he calls?

433
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:24,018
10 or 15 minutes later.

434
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:25,489
All right.

435
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:28,825
All right. Now remember,

436
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:31,127
you're not to answer your
phone until after 7:00

437
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:32,458
when I'm on the tap.

438
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:34,963
When Wheeler calls, you give him the all
- clear.

439
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,728
Then you leave, fast.

440
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:40,326
One man will tail you and I'll
change places with the man outside.

441
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:41,736
Have you got an extra key to your apartment?

442
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:43,137
No, but maybe... Never mind.

443
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,267
When you go, leave the
door open so I can get in.

444
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:48,777
- How long do I stay away?
- You don't come back until you call me first.

445
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:51,577
If it's all over, I'll
be there to take the call.

446
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,377
If you don't get an answer, stay away.

447
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:55,984
Have you got it all straight?

448
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:57,282
Yes. You sure?

449
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:58,515
Uh-huh. All right.

450
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,682
Now go down in your car

451
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,486
and drive around for a
while and then come back.

452
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,527
I'll be right behind you.

453
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:07,193
Couldn't I drive to your place?

454
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:09,090
No.

455
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,593
No, we can't take any
more chances. Now, go on.

456
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:19,872
Be careful, Paul.

457
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:30,687
Man!

458
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,055
The redhead on the third floor?

459
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:35,752
Isn't that the most...

460
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:38,387
Well, you only get out of a sweater
what you put into it, I always say.

461
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:39,953
Yeah. You said it twice this morning.

462
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,931
Let me have a look.

463
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,405
Answer your phone, Blondie.

464
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:07,322
What's going on?

465
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:08,859
Still in the bedroom.

466
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:12,054
She's not going to answer it.

467
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:16,625
That's funny.

468
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:23,535
You just missed something.

469
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:25,609
What happened? Her phone rang,

470
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:26,769
half a dozen times.

471
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,311
She just ignored it.

472
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,415
- How'd she react?
- Couldn't tell. She was in the bedroom.

473
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,074
Maybe she knows her phone is tapped.

474
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,382
You're sure she wasn't in
the shower or something?

475
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,149
Just stood in the bedroom
and stared at the phone.

476
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,247
Almost hate to leave.

477
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,724
This may be the big night.

478
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:44,284
Yeah. I can hardly tear myself away.

479
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:45,895
Well, enjoy the view.

480
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,296
We'll see you. Good night.

481
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:52,459
If that call was supposed to mean something,

482
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:54,334
she isn't showing it.

483
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,302
Probably her roommate's party.

484
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,276
Must be her night off or something.

485
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:09,206
How do you know it isn't her party?

486
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,679
She's tired.

487
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:13,717
I saw her come home
tonight, and she was beat.

488
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,651
You'd never know it to look at her now.

489
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,926
Well, this thing will
probably go on all night.

490
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,431
What do you care?

491
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:28,587
I don't.

492
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:36,200
Maybe I do. I find myself watching
her like I was her father or something.

493
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,008
I wait for her to come home.

494
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:40,601
When she's late, I worry about her,

495
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:42,578
wonder what she's doing.

496
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:46,807
And, uh, who she's doing
it with. Is that the idea?

497
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:50,015
Yeah, something like that.

498
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,182
At least I feel I know her well enough to...

499
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:57,558
She's going to answer it.

500
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,326
<i>Hello.</i>

501
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:05,732
<i>Good evening.
This is the RTV Rating Service.</i>

502
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:08,135
<i>Would you tell me what program
you're watching right now?</i>

503
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:09,969
<i>TV program, that is.</i>

504
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:11,799
<i>I'm not watching TV.</i>

505
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:13,977
<i>I see. Thank you.</i>

506
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:20,746
Did you ever hear of an RTV Rating Service?

507
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:21,944
No.

508
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,543
See what she's doing.

509
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,285
She's gone into the bedroom.

510
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:32,893
She's going out, Paul. This may be it.

511
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:35,232
Like me to take her this time?

512
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,324
I'd give my right arm to nail
that babe and her boyfriend.

513
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,892
Okay, Rick. Go ahead. Good luck.

514
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,878
<i>Operator.
- Mobile operator.</i>

515
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,709
<i>One moment, please.</i>

516
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:27,150
<i>Mobile operator.</i>

517
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:29,652
Give me WJ
8-2-3-1-1.

518
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:31,078
<i>Your name and number?</i>

519
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,851
Sheridan.
Hollywood 9-5-2-6-4.

520
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:35,015
Hurry it up, please.

521
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:36,184
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

522
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:47,569
<i>There's no answer, sir.</i>

523
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:48,866
No answer?

524
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,101
There's got to be an answer. Try it again.

525
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:54,376
<i>Yes, sir.
WJ 8-2-3-1-1.</i>

526
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:42,253
What's up, Paul? Your job, that's what's up.

527
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:44,055
The effects from... I'm sorry,
Paul, but all I did was...

528
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:45,925
I know. We'll talk about it later.

529
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:47,362
I'll take over in the car. You go upstairs.

530
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:49,365
Sure, Paul, but I...

531
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,534
What is it? Wheeler.

532
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,777
He's gone in. We've got to call Rick.

533
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:09,114
No! No, Rick's not up there.

534
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:10,414
The girl went out. He's tailing her.

535
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,183
Then what'll we do?

536
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:14,450
Well?

537
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:15,650
When he finds out she's not up there,

538
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,717
he may get scared and run.

539
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:20,693
If he doesn't, we'll go up
and take him there. Come on.

540
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:38,277
Eckstrom don't need to know
about what happened, does he?

541
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,040
What? Eckstrom.

542
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:42,748
Does he have to know about...

543
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,145
If nothing goes wrong, no.

544
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:08,337
I don't want to lose my pension, Paul.

545
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
But I

546
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,711
guess you'll do what you got to do.

547
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:16,878
I'll give you every break I can.

548
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:19,449
If you'd been on the job, I'd
have taken him at the elevator,

549
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:21,548
the way Eckstrom wanted it.

550
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,593
You better hope nothing goes wrong.

551
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:45,279
Hold it, Wheeler! I got him!

552
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:48,841
Now, let's go.

553
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,145
Where? Downtown.

554
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:54,191
But first we'll pick up the money, huh?

555
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:56,690
You got it in your car?

556
00:46:57,762 --> 00:46:59,662
Let's go find out, huh?

557
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:50,710
This it? Yeah.

558
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:52,476
Locked? Yeah.

559
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,313
Let's have the keys.

560
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:10,630
Looks like the whole bundle.

561
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:13,261
What'd you do with your
partner, Wheeler? Kill him?

562
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:16,436
Okay, Paddy, close the satchel.

563
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:27,243
What happened?
He jumped you. What else?

564
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:28,683
Why'd you shoot him? I
could have handled him.

565
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:31,687
Why, you're half-drunk. For
all I knew he had your gun.

566
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,215
Well, what now? I don't know.

567
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:37,420
Eckstrom will crucify
us. He wanted him alive.

568
00:48:37,495 --> 00:48:39,053
There'll only be one goat.

569
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,222
Me.

570
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:41,464
No.

571
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:44,561
No, there's a way out. Give me a hand, Paddy.

572
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:47,331
What're you doing? I'm saving your skin.

573
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,703
Tomorrow, I'll drive the
car someplace and leave it.

574
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:55,836
They'll find it and we'll be in the clear.

575
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:58,177
All we have to do is keep our mouths shut.

576
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:00,111
What's the gimmick?

577
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,252
Gimmick? You doing all this for me?

578
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:05,015
Why not?

579
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,653
I don't know.

580
00:49:07,158 --> 00:49:09,786
But I'd rather lose my pension than...

581
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:14,628
When they find Wheeler, will
they find that money, too?

582
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:17,127
What kind of a crack is that?

583
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:18,832
Maybe I'd better call Eckstrom right now?

584
00:49:18,903 --> 00:49:20,165
I gotta know, Paul.

585
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:21,431
I gotta know the money will be there.

586
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,268
Sure, it will be there!

587
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:25,408
Then give me the keys.

588
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:28,304
We'll both drive the car away tomorrow.

589
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,979
Okay, Paddy.

590
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:33,306
You keep them.

591
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,242
We'd better get back.

592
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:20,852
- What'll it be?
- Same as hers.

593
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:29,158
Hello.

594
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:54,180
I'm afraid I gave you the wrong impression.

595
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:55,282
I doubt it.

596
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,556
No really, you remind me of someone.

597
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:01,227
Haven't you ever met me before?

598
00:52:01,298 --> 00:52:03,163
Hundreds of times.

599
00:52:04,068 --> 00:52:05,365
I don't get it.

600
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:07,836
And you won't, so try someplace else.

601
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:09,429
No. You've got the wrong idea.

602
00:52:09,506 --> 00:52:12,100
I'm not just fresh, I'm sure
that I've met you someplace.

603
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,138
What...

604
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:17,070
Uh, will there be anything else, sir?

605
00:52:34,732 --> 00:52:36,495
<i>Hello.
- It's me, Paul.</i>

606
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:38,401
<i>It's done.</i>

607
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:39,936
Is everything all right?

608
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:41,903
There's a complication, but I can handle it.

609
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:43,405
Get back here.

610
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:45,533
What happened? I'll talk to you later.

611
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:51,607
Oh, I'm sorry.

612
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:53,809
We're having a little party next
door and ran out of ice cubes.

613
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:56,284
Could I borrow some? I'm
sorry. I can't help you.

614
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:45,426
How'd it go, Rick?

615
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:48,403
Another dry run. I think she spotted me.

616
00:53:48,472 --> 00:53:49,598
Why?

617
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:52,504
She made a call from the Twilight
Room and came right back here.

618
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:54,544
It means she spotted me or
knows her phone's tapped.

619
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:55,737
Or both.

620
00:53:55,813 --> 00:53:57,440
Or neither. Maybe.

621
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,781
Hey, you're up kind of late, Lieutenant.

622
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:03,108
- Something break?
- Our man's in town.

623
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:07,584
Spotted in a drug store on the
east side earlier this evening.

624
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:09,423
I'd hoped you might have him here for me.

625
00:54:09,493 --> 00:54:10,983
Well, we'd hoped the same thing.

626
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:12,653
I'm afraid I haven't.

627
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:13,855
Why not?

628
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,694
The dame acts like she
knows her phone's tapped.

629
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,324
Made a call from a bar tonight.

630
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:19,301
Probably touted him off.

631
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,201
Then you've been here alone.

632
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:23,205
For the last hour, yeah.

633
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:24,604
All quiet?

634
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,939
Her phone rang once. That's all.

635
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:31,009
Check the neighborhood, Sheridan.

636
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:33,106
Parked cars, alleys.

637
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:34,343
I'll wait here a while.

638
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:35,745
Right.

639
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:49,864
What time did you leave
tonight, Rick, to tail her?

640
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:51,195
About 10:30.

641
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:53,733
What time did you get back?

642
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:55,737
A minute ago. Why?

643
00:54:56,373 --> 00:55:00,275
I phoned here a half dozen
times between 10:50 and 11:15.

644
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,741
No answer.

645
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,406
Some thing from the car parked outside.

646
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:08,641
I gave him a chance to
explain. Why didn't he?

647
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:11,777
Talk to Paddy?

648
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:14,986
He had nothing to offer either.

649
00:55:15,058 --> 00:55:16,889
But he's scared to death.

650
00:55:17,895 --> 00:55:20,887
You and Sheridan are
fairly close, aren't you?

651
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:22,497
That's right.

652
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:24,625
But I'm not trying to cover for him.

653
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:27,499
Maybe Paul's trying to do it for Dolan.

654
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:28,833
Why?

655
00:55:28,906 --> 00:55:30,066
Why not ask Dolan?

656
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,765
I'm asking you. And I want an answer.

657
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,571
When I followed her I
drove past the lookout car.

658
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:37,807
Paddy wasn't in it.

659
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:39,743
When I got to the intersection,

660
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:42,451
I saw him go into a bar.

661
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:46,281
I guess that bar was just a little too close.

662
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:58,791
Paul, we... Shut up and get back in the car.

663
00:56:06,944 --> 00:56:08,571
Eckstrom talk to you?

664
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:11,011
He knows something's up. What'd you tell him?

665
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,446
Nothing I didn't have to. He knew.

666
00:56:12,516 --> 00:56:14,746
He doesn't know anything.
He just thinks he does.

667
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:17,548
He gave me a phony job
to get me out of the room.

668
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:19,420
Give me the keys to Wheeler's car.

669
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,287
I'll get it out of here while
we've still got a chance.

670
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:23,917
Come on! Give me the keys!

671
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,485
We're only making things worse, Paul.

672
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:28,697
I'm goin' up and tell Eckstrom
just the way it happened.

673
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:30,357
You're not going to tell him anything.

674
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,231
I'm in this, too, remember?

675
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:33,528
Why?

676
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:35,896
You were just coverin' for me.

677
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:37,804
Isn't that right? And
Eckstrom'll throw the book at me.

678
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:41,103
- Who do you think you're kiddin'?
- You'll come out sweet as a rose.

679
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:43,576
A hero for trying to protect a buddy.

680
00:56:43,647 --> 00:56:46,207
Look, Paddy, Eckstrom can't prove a thing.

681
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:48,312
Why throw away your pension?

682
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:51,821
Because I spent 25 years
being a dumb, honest cop.

683
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:55,314
And I'm stuck with it. Wait a minute.

684
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:01,263
What's the idea?

685
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:03,265
You didn't do anything for me.

686
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,630
You're after that dough.

687
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:08,102
That's why you came down looking for me.

688
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:10,603
You knew Wheeler was going to show.

689
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:12,265
Now wait a minute, Paddy.

690
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,469
Nope. We're both going up
and tell it just like it...

691
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,882
Doesn't answer. Come on.

692
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:35,155
Tell 'em to get here as fast
as they can, but no sirens.

693
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,284
And keep this from the press boys!

694
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:47,059
I heard a shot!

695
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:50,433
Paddy?

696
00:58:54,444 --> 00:58:55,536
Dead?

697
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:58,606
Rick, get those people back to bed.

698
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:01,315
We don't want a crowd around here.

699
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:02,778
All right, folks,
back on the sidewalk.

700
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:04,252
What's going on, officer? We heard the shot.

701
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:06,755
Just a slight accident.
Back on the sidewalk, please.

702
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:09,087
What do you think? I don't know.

703
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:11,093
Powder burns, his own gun.

704
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:12,628
Why would he kill himself?

705
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:14,357
I didn't say that.

706
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:16,023
Then you think he didn't?

707
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:27,266
Where were you tonight around 11:00?

708
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:30,277
- I was upstairs. Why?
- No, you weren't.

709
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:32,542
We know where Dolan was. Where were you?

710
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:34,276
You know where Dolan was?

711
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,080
McAllister saw him.

712
00:59:36,953 --> 00:59:38,978
I told him I'd cover for him.

713
00:59:39,256 --> 00:59:41,690
I tried to get him on the car
phone about 10:30, he didn't answer.

714
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:42,782
I know.

715
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:44,759
The operator gave me the message just now.

716
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:47,488
I came down to see what had happened to him.

717
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:49,497
Found he'd gone over to the bar.

718
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:52,091
He was scared. He kept
talking about his pension.

719
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:54,234
I brought him back here.

720
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:57,205
I tried to make him understand
I wouldn't say anything,

721
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:00,074
but I guess he wasn't listening.

722
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:03,470
Well, you'd better get back upstairs.

723
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:04,980
We've still got a job to do here.

724
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,140
Yeah.

725
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,725
There's not much point keeping
a stakeout now, is there?

726
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:17,917
You got any better ideas?

727
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:39,174
Yeah, right away.

728
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:02,603
Oh, look, there's been an accident.

729
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:03,696
Wonder what happened?

730
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:06,130
- Wanna go over? Maybe you can help.
- No, they don't need us.

731
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,809
- They'd be the first to say so.
- Oh, it's so late.

732
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:10,141
Come on.

733
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,511
Are you sure you won't change
your mind and come with us, Ann?

734
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,739
- No, you all go on.
- All right. And have fun.

735
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:16,308
You know the Crockett's
number if you need me.

736
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:17,546
Oh, don't worry.

737
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:19,020
Give us a call.
- All right. Bye.

738
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:21,353
Nighty night. Bye.

739
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:50,179
He's dead. I shot him.

740
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:51,277
What do you mean? Paddy Dolan.

741
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:52,514
What happened? I killed him.

742
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:54,079
The poor, dumb, harmless...

743
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:55,283
He pulled a gun on me.

744
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,155
It went off. It was an accident. I...

745
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:09,863
Are they after you? No.

746
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,237
But everything's gone wrong.

747
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:12,466
Paddy and...

748
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:13,600
And that girl downstairs,

749
01:02:13,677 --> 01:02:15,508
she saw me in your apartment. What girl?

750
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:17,603
The one that lives next to you. The nurse.

751
01:02:17,681 --> 01:02:19,478
Does she know who you are? I don't think so.

752
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:21,141
But she'll remember me.
She'll remember me good.

753
01:02:21,217 --> 01:02:22,775
Paul, look, we've got the
money. Why don't we get out now?

754
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:25,150
We haven't got the money! The car's gone.

755
01:02:25,221 --> 01:02:27,189
How? Paddy must have moved it.

756
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:29,149
He couldn't have moved it far.

757
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:30,692
It must be around here someplace close.

758
01:02:31,695 --> 01:02:33,754
Maybe we could spot it from up here.

759
01:02:35,332 --> 01:02:37,527
McAllister's still down there.

760
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,901
You take that side. I'll look over here.

761
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:16,701
Go on upstairs, Rick.

762
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:19,807
Who tells Paddy's wife?

763
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:22,474
That goes with my job.

764
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,570
What are you going to say? He killed himself?

765
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:27,912
What else can I say?

766
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,950
Get those people out of there.

767
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:45,729
Anything serious?

768
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:47,694
No.

769
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:00,675
You know, you're a bitter
disappointment to me.

770
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,842
Oh?

771
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:03,509
The other night.

772
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:05,577
You were just doing your job.

773
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:08,884
You are a policeman, aren't you?

774
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,126
Paul!

775
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:23,096
That's it.

776
01:04:23,173 --> 01:04:25,539
Go down to your apartment, stay
there a few minutes, and then leave.

777
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:27,633
I want the man that follows
you kept out at least an hour.

778
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,710
What are you going to do?

779
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:30,678
I'm going to put Wheeler's body
where it'll be found tonight.

780
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:32,237
Why? Why take any chance now?

781
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:34,078
Tomorrow we... I can't do
it in the broad daylight.

782
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,209
And if that girl sees me again, I'm through.

783
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:39,983
When they find the body, the stakeout
will be over and I'll be away from here.

784
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:44,183
Everything's going to
be all right? Sure. Sure.

785
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:51,095
You have a wonderful way
of sidestepping questions.

786
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,499
Shall I just stop asking them?

787
01:04:53,636 --> 01:04:55,160
Right now, yes.

788
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:57,729
But save them for next week.

789
01:04:58,374 --> 01:04:59,739
Next week?

790
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:02,342
You wouldn't be asking for a date?

791
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:04,545
I can't even answer that for sure.

792
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:06,582
Is your name in the book?

793
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,440
Ann Stewart, with a "W."

794
01:05:08,518 --> 01:05:09,644
But you'd better call me at the hospital.

795
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:11,414
After our party tonight, we may be evicted.

796
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:12,546
Was it that bad?

797
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:15,056
I didn't think so, but the
people next door apparently did.

798
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:16,284
People next door.

799
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,122
You don't mean 423?

800
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:20,588
Yes. Why not? What happened?

801
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:23,924
Well, nothing, really. I went over
to borrow some ice cubes from him.

802
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,195
Him? You mean her, don't you?

803
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:28,229
No, I mean him.

804
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,177
What time was it?

805
01:05:42,285 --> 01:05:44,583
Well, about 11:00.

806
01:05:45,155 --> 01:05:46,747
Is he important?

807
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:49,690
He may have killed a man
last week and another tonight.

808
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:58,492
Do you think you could recognize
him if you saw him again?

809
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:01,033
Yes. I think I could.

810
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:03,905
Then you'll be hearing from
me sooner than I thought.

811
01:06:03,973 --> 01:06:05,304
Good night.

812
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:19,044
Wheeler was here. In her apartment.

813
01:06:19,556 --> 01:06:22,047
When? When you were out looking for Paddy.

814
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:23,416
How'd you find out about it?

815
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:25,518
The nurse. She tried to
borrow some ice cubes.

816
01:06:25,595 --> 01:06:27,688
He gave her a fast brush-off.

817
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:29,162
223 please.

818
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,360
Mitchell?

819
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,197
When Eckstrom gets in, have him call me.

820
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:35,468
McAllister. Right.

821
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:37,933
Could she identify him?

822
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:39,975
Well, who else could it be?

823
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:41,704
What's the blonde doing?

824
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:43,211
The usual things.

825
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:45,975
If there's anybody in there
with her, she doesn't know it.

826
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:48,742
Do you think the nurse scared him off?

827
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:51,646
I don't know.

828
01:06:51,854 --> 01:06:53,583
She said he opened the
door before she knocked,

829
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:55,146
as if he was leaving.

830
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:57,290
Well, then when he found
out his girl wasn't up there,

831
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,384
he probably got nervous
and... That's just it.

832
01:06:58,461 --> 01:07:00,019
Why wasn't she?

833
01:07:00,296 --> 01:07:03,163
I can't spot it, but
something's wrong somewhere.

834
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,500
And what happened to Paddy,
that doesn't fit either.

835
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,038
Eckstrom must have scared
him out of his mind.

836
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,638
Do you really think Paddy killed himself?

837
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:15,803
If you were going to check out,
would you put a.38 slug in your belly?

838
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:17,470
Nobody kills himself like that.

839
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:19,014
Least of all a cop.

840
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,947
I know Paddy like I know my own self.

841
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:23,451
He wouldn't have done it. Not
that way, or any other way.

842
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,147
And he certainly wouldn't have
let Wheeler get that close.

843
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:27,553
Maybe he did.

844
01:07:27,624 --> 01:07:28,648
No.

845
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,187
You know what I think, Paul.

846
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,097
I think whoever killed Paddy was
right there in the car with him.

847
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:38,599
Sitting right there beside him.

848
01:07:42,005 --> 01:07:43,199
Hello.

849
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:45,898
All right, give him a message.

850
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:48,807
Wheeler paid us a visit about 11:00 tonight.

851
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:50,869
The lady in apartment 426.

852
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:52,947
Yeah, she went over to borrow some ice cubes.

853
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:33,205
She there?

854
01:10:33,376 --> 01:10:35,708
She just came in. Where'd she go?

855
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:38,578
Nowhere. Anything happen over there?

856
01:10:38,648 --> 01:10:40,377
No, it's all quiet.

857
01:10:41,117 --> 01:10:42,846
Know where she went?

858
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,409
To the beach.

859
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:47,514
Looked at the water exactly three minutes,

860
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,387
came right back here.

861
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:52,283
- Why?
- It doesn't make sense.

862
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:54,022
Well, she probably figured
there's only one man

863
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:55,461
watching her place, wanted to draw him off.

864
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:56,725
Why? Nothing happened over there,

865
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:59,131
and Schaeffer didn't see anything outside.

866
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:37,397
Rick, you'd better come with me.

867
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:39,270
We've got work to do.

868
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,672
Wheeler's dead. What happened?

869
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:43,473
Two.38 slugs in the back.

870
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:44,945
Where? When?

871
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:48,575
Dumped out of a car on Third and
Wilmer, about a half an hour ago.

872
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:51,377
Doesn't she ever go to bed?

873
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:54,649
We're going over there and get a few answers.

874
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:55,884
You stay here Paul.

875
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:58,586
It'll go smoother if she
doesn't see you just now.

876
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:20,744
Hello. This is Paul.

877
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:22,109
Now, listen.

878
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:24,379
McAllister and Eckstrom are
on their way over to see you.

879
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:25,453
They'll be there in a minute.

880
01:12:25,521 --> 01:12:27,421
They'll ask you a lot of questions,
but they don't know a thing.

881
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:28,787
So don't let them scare you.

882
01:12:29,659 --> 01:12:31,092
No, I'll be over here.

883
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,390
But in case you do see me,
you know me. Remember that?

884
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:35,089
All right, Paul.

885
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,667
- Who is it?
Police.

886
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:57,981
Where does he think he's going?

887
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:00,417
What is this anyway? Routine check.

888
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:02,821
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Harry Wheeler.

889
01:13:03,593 --> 01:13:05,254
Get him out of my bedroom.

890
01:13:05,328 --> 01:13:06,693
All right.

891
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:30,152
Won't you sit down, Miss McLane?

892
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:33,515
May I?

893
01:13:37,093 --> 01:13:38,958
When was the last time you heard from him?

894
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:40,689
Who? Harry Wheeler.

895
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:43,427
Who's Harry Wheeler?

896
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:46,732
He's been getting some
space in this week's papers.

897
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:49,562
I'm afraid I don't read the paper.

898
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:52,130
And I don't know anyone named Harry.

899
01:13:52,508 --> 01:13:55,477
Don't you have to know a man to
give him a key to your apartment?

900
01:13:55,544 --> 01:13:57,341
What's that supposed to mean?

901
01:13:57,413 --> 01:14:00,644
Harry Wheeler was in this
apartment tonight at 11:00.

902
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:02,147
I wasn't even here at 11:00.

903
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:04,516
No, you were at the Twilight Room.

904
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:05,952
But there was a man here.

905
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:08,420
If it wasn't Wheeler, who was it?

906
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:11,258
If there was anyone here, he broke in.

907
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,659
What did Wheeler come up here for?

908
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:16,228
Maybe it wasn't Wheeler.

909
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:18,857
You knew his partner, too, didn't you?

910
01:14:18,968 --> 01:14:20,196
No sale.

911
01:14:20,736 --> 01:14:22,101
You didn't find what you were looking for,

912
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:24,162
so why don't you let me go to bed?

913
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,767
I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you, Lona.

914
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:30,209
Wheeler's partner double-crossed him,

915
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:32,839
which means he double-crossed you, too.

916
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:36,612
He shot Wheeler tonight and
dumped his body into the street.

917
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:39,578
Which means nothing to me.

918
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:45,057
If I didn't know better, I'd
think we were on the wrong track.

919
01:14:45,428 --> 01:14:48,397
Call the stakeout. Have
him bring over the log.

920
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,193
We've been keeping a score sheet on you.

921
01:14:53,502 --> 01:14:56,027
We'll go over it together, point by point.

922
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:06,739
Sheridan.

923
01:15:06,816 --> 01:15:09,614
Rick. Eckstrom wants the log brought over.

924
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:10,845
I'll be right over.

925
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,314
Hello, Lona.

926
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:25,316
I might've known.

927
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:27,260
You're just the type.

928
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:31,023
You want me to stick around?

929
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,795
Afraid she doesn't like you, Paul?

930
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:34,062
Better wait for us. Right.

931
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:01,988
Operator? Give me the police.

932
01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:03,122
Hurry!

933
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:03,357
<i>Cars 49 and 60,</i>

934
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:07,953
<i>Park Crest Hotel, 322
French Street: Code Three:</i>

935
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,059
Sheridan. Eckstrom there?

936
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:15,964
Well, you'd better go over and give him this.

937
01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:17,630
A woman in the building,

938
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:20,538
an Ann Stewart, apartment 421.

939
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:22,236
She just called in.

940
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:24,745
Says she saw the man we're
after. Whatever that means.

941
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:27,441
Oh, and... Yeah, two more cars.

942
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:30,945
She mentioned McAllister,
so it may be a break.

943
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,419
Yeah, you never know.

944
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:34,283
Okay.

945
01:19:12,962 --> 01:19:13,962
Who's there?

946
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:15,695
Miss Ann Stewart?

947
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:16,856
Yes?

948
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:18,763
The police. Did you put in a call?

949
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:27,404
...no reason. When I can't sleep, I drive.

950
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:28,841
Who pays your rent?

951
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,310
I do! How?

952
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,438
What about the call you got from RTV?

953
01:19:32,514 --> 01:19:33,811
I don't know what you're talking about.

954
01:19:33,882 --> 01:19:35,747
It wasn't the rating service
that called. We checked on it.

955
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:37,285
Who was it?

956
01:19:37,353 --> 01:19:39,048
If there was a call, I don't remember it.

957
01:19:39,621 --> 01:19:42,522
Now, if you do as you're
told, you won't get hurt.

958
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,922
What are you going to do?

959
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:53,963
Well, think it over.
You've got until tomorrow.

960
01:19:54,036 --> 01:19:55,731
But don't try to leave unless
you want to be picked up

961
01:19:55,804 --> 01:19:57,294
and booked for vagrancy.

962
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:08,480
Get your coat.

963
01:20:09,018 --> 01:20:10,576
Come on! Come on!

964
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:22,992
Sheridan?

965
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,396
I guess he went downstairs.

966
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:27,628
Yeah.

967
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:47,947
Yes? It's Paul. Open up.

968
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:49,787
Turn the lights out first.

969
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:55,320
Get dressed, we're getting out of here.

970
01:20:55,864 --> 01:20:57,161
Go on, hurry!

971
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:10,038
Where's Sheridan? Upstairs.

972
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:12,376
If he was upstairs I wouldn't
be asking you about him.

973
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,813
Didn't he just give you a message?

974
01:21:13,882 --> 01:21:15,213
What are you talking about? What message?

975
01:21:15,284 --> 01:21:18,082
A woman called. Said she saw
the guy we're looking for.

976
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:19,177
What was her name?

977
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:20,881
Stewart. 421...

978
01:21:57,559 --> 01:21:58,821
Ann!

979
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:31,484
All right. All right, now
go out... Hold on a second.

980
01:22:33,262 --> 01:22:36,231
Sheridan, the blonde, the girl who
just called in, they're all missing!

981
01:22:38,133 --> 01:22:40,226
You and Schaeffer search
the building, top to bottom.

982
01:22:40,302 --> 01:22:41,860
Who are we after?

983
01:22:41,937 --> 01:22:45,600
Maybe Paul Sheridan. Take a
prowl car and cover the back.

984
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:36,053
What's wrong? A prowl car
right behind Wheeler's.

985
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:37,216
Do you think they know it's Harry's car?

986
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:38,452
I don't know.

987
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:40,290
Maybe they just happened to park there.

988
01:23:41,496 --> 01:23:43,862
There's one way to find out. Here,

989
01:23:45,033 --> 01:23:47,331
that car over there,
here's the key to the trunk.

990
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:49,734
Open it. You'll find a bag, bring it here.

991
01:23:49,805 --> 01:23:50,897
Take it!

992
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:54,600
Be smart.

993
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:20,164
Don't turn around.

994
01:24:20,235 --> 01:24:21,827
When I fire, get behind the car.

995
01:24:22,571 --> 01:24:23,571
Duck!

996
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:41,885
It's clear that way. Go to Western
and Wilshire, wait for me there.

997
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:43,288
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get that car.

998
01:24:43,358 --> 01:24:44,950
Now go on hurry! No, wait!
You can't get that money!

999
01:24:45,027 --> 01:24:46,289
Will you go, Lona?
Please, don't try to get...

1000
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:47,419
Go on!

1001
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:15,252
Hold it, Sheridan!

1002
01:25:31,139 --> 01:25:32,902
Radio George Street, emergency.

1003
01:25:41,116 --> 01:25:42,708
I'm sorry, Rick.

1004
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,116
So am I, Paul. So am I.

1005
01:26:32,968 --> 01:26:35,198
I thought I told you to go.

1006
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:43,344
We really didn't need that money, did we?

1007
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:17,310
Come on, I'll walk you home.
