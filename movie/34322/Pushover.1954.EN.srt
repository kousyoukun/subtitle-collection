1
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,429
Need some help?

2
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,132
<i>Maybe you've got
the motor flooded.</i>

3
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,571
What do I do
about it?

4
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,267
Want me to try?

5
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,943
All right.

6
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,546
Shove over.

7
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,751
Did you like
the show?

8
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,983
Yeah.

9
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,658
How did you know
I was there?

10
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,123
I saw you. Wondered why you were alone.

11
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,360
I wondered the same thing about you.

12
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>It doesn't seem
to be flooded.</i>

13
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,065
<i>I'll take a look
under the hood.</i>

14
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,228
<i>I don't know. I don't think
you're getting any spark.</i>

15
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,199
<i>I'm not?</i>

16
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,104
Not enough to
start the car.

17
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,499
Any suggestions?

18
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,440
Yeah, I think you ought to
have a mechanic look at it.

19
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,878
<i>There's an all-night
garage on Normandie.</i>

20
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,178
You could call them
from a bar over here.

21
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,949
All right.

22
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,851
<i>I'd feel much better
if you went with me.</i>

23
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,960
That was the idea.

24
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,664
Another drink?

25
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,178
You could play the record again, though.

26
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,772
Okay.

27
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,716
Oh. Did you get it started?

28
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,082
<i>Have to tow it in
to the shop, ma'am.</i>

29
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,780
<i>I can't seem to locate the trouble.</i>

30
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,247
How long will
that take?

31
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,755
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

32
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,723
Could I call
you here?

33
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,260
Bartender, what
time do you close?

34
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,955
<i>12:00. We don't get much late trade.</i>

35
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,755
<i>All right. I guess we'll have to call you.</i>

36
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,958
Okay.

37
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,532
Well...

38
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,405
You like to
take me home?

39
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:20,964
Now?

40
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,368
Sure.

41
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,815
Your place
or mine?

42
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,521
Surprise me.

43
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,422
Yeah.

44
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,862
<i>Well, there's
no particular hurry.</i>

45
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,773
<i>Well, why don't you check with
the mechanic and call me back?</i>

46
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,768
Hollywood 33-449.

47
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,204
Right.

48
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,638
Mind?

49
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,376
No, help yourself.

50
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,921
<i>That was with plain water, wasn't it?</i>

51
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,223
Uh-huh.

52
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,995
Sorry?

53
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,261
Sorry? For what?

54
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,733
Picking me up.

55
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,473
Is that what you
call it, a pick-up?

56
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,873
<i>Don't you?</i>

57
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,903
Do you get
picked up often?

58
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,305
Would you care?

59
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,983
<i>If I said yes, it wouldn't
make much sense, would it?</i>

60
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,982
No.

61
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,918
<i>I guess it wouldn't.</i>

62
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,996
<i>The answer's yes.</i>

63
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,040
<i>Would it make any sense if I told
you it's never happened before?</i>

64
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,507
Maybe.

65
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,390
Funny.

66
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,329
When I saw you come into
the theater tonight, I...

67
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,533
I thought how
awful it was.

68
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,036
The two of us
there all alone.

69
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,664
<i>It doesn't make sense,
a girl like you.</i>

70
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,799
New car, mink coat.

71
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,275
Perfume,
$50 an ounce.

72
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,333
<i>It's $100.</i>

73
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,137
Still alone. Why?

74
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,440
Uh-uh.

75
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,276
<i>No questions.
Don't spoil it.</i>

76
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,881
Yeah.

77
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,492
How long
will it take?

78
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,885
Wait a minute.

79
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,323
<i>He says the
distributor's shot.</i>

80
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,764
Take a couple of hours,
maybe longer, to fix it.

81
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,193
He wants to know
where to deliver it.

82
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,261
You tell him.

83
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:13,108
You can deliver it here. 3916
Crescent Way, apartment D.

84
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,406
Right.

85
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,568
<i>We're doing
the best we can.</i>

86
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,606
After all, identifying Harry
Wheeler as one of the men

87
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,871
who knocked off the bank
was no break, it was...

88
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,842
Yes, sir.

89
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,912
All right, sir,
as soon as I get it.

90
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,479
What about you, Rick?
Anything from St. Louis?

91
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,818
<i>Wheeler was there till five
weeks ago. That's all we got.</i>

92
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,915
Nothing on who he left with? Why he left?

93
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,789
<i>They're working on it.</i>

94
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,852
About time
you showed.

95
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,954
Have you got
anything for us?

96
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,556
Well, nothing
definite, no.

97
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,567
What do you want? Another
three days with her?

98
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,330
<i>I didn't ask for
the first three.</i>

99
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,804
<i>Okay, Paul. We've been
drawing blanks here, too.</i>

100
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,864
You can have more time
with her if you need it.

101
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,034
<i>I'm satisfied
she's Wheeler's girl.</i>

102
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,537
Oh? Why?

103
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,910
Well, it seems to add up. We
spend a lot of time at my place,

104
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,005
never at hers.

105
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,674
She obviously has
a generous friend

106
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,115
<i>who's not around
at the moment.</i>

107
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,153
Last night, when I tried to
take her to the Lombardy Club,

108
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,551
she backed off.

109
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,713
<i>What's
the connection?</i>

110
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,382
<i>It's one of
Wheeler's hangouts.</i>

111
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,153
<i>You think that's
enough to go on?</i>

112
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,693
<i>Don't you?</i>

113
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,728
<i>lt'll have to do.</i>

114
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,560
Harris, bring in
that layout.

115
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,594
Oh, what about
the girl?

116
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,425
I told her I was going to
be out of town for a while.

117
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,765
<i>Oh, I got this from the bank
yesterday. It's the official count.</i>

118
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,866
$210,000, and no record
of the serial numbers.

119
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,939
This is a layout of the
building the girl lives in.

120
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,379
This is her
apartment here.

121
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,349
<i>We'll take over this one across the way.</i>

122
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,681
Be sure you avoid contact
with the rest of the tenants.

123
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,618
<i>There'll be two men in
this room at all times,</i>

124
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,156
one on the phone tap,
the other at the window.

125
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,590
Another man will be in the
lookout car out in front.

126
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,924
If Wheeler shows, the man in
the lookout car phones upstairs

127
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,326
and the other two
will be ready for him

128
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,058
when he steps out
of the elevator.

129
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,429
Sounds real simple.

130
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,489
It is.

131
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,503
<i>If you ask me, Wheeler's
halfway to Peru right now.</i>

132
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,232
All that dough and a
murder rap hanging over him.

133
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,573
<i>Look, get it out of your
head that Wheeler won't show.</i>

134
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,880
<i>This is all we've got to go on,
and I want you expecting him.</i>

135
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,973
Did you ever read the
statistics on bank jobs, Paddy?

136
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,651
Ever hear of a heist
man being picked up

137
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,813
afterward on a highway
or international border?

138
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,719
They find them holed up in the big city.

139
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,624
<i>And 70% of the time,
there's a dame with them.</i>

140
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:43,988
How about it, Paul?

141
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,928
Think Wheeler
will be around?

142
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,589
<i>Yeah, he'll be around.</i>

143
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,331
Everything
straight then?

144
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,265
How about those back
doors? They kept locked?

145
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,239
<i>They can't be opened from the outside.</i>

146
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,207
<i>You'll be in charge
of the stakeout, Paul.</i>

147
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,039
And you know
what I want.

148
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,671
You want Wheeler.
I want him alive.

149
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,575
Remember that,
all of you.

150
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,879
<i>Dead, he can't tell us where the
money is or who his partner was.</i>

151
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,386
Alive, he can save us
a lot of dirty work.

152
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:10,983
What watch
shall we take?

153
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,045
The important one.

154
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,456
<i>I'm putting Briggs, Fine
and Corrick on the day watch.</i>

155
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,087
<i>Doesn't figure that Wheeler'll
show up in broad daylight.</i>

156
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,323
<i>Well, I guess
that's everything.</i>

157
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,297
Pick yourself up a copy
of this from Harris.

158
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,297
Paul...

159
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,540
Keep your eye on Paddy.

160
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,008
<i>I'd like to see him
get his pension.</i>

161
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,337
<i>And he won't
if he slips again.</i>

162
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,339
Find Briggs and
send him in to me.

163
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,924
Paul, Rick.
Hiya, boys.

164
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,263
Been a long afternoon. Anything doing?

165
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,666
She went out once.
Briggs tailed her.

166
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,294
She took her car around for a lube job.

167
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,360
Might mean
something.

168
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,463
<i>She's waiting for
someone all right.</i>

169
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,837
<i>Doesn't know what
to do with herself.</i>

170
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,967
Smoked a pack of cigarettes
in the past two hours.

171
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,443
Coffee if you want it. Thanks.

172
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,446
All the comforts of
home. She get any calls?

173
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,776
<i>Nope. Everything's
in the log there.</i>

174
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,281
Have fun.
See you.

175
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,409
At 7.00 a.m.
Yeah.

176
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,118
2:46, called in for...

177
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,424
For nothing.

178
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,684
Have you got her? Uh-huh.

179
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,531
What do you think?

180
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,926
<i>You're right.
He'll be around.</i>

181
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,230
<i>To me she's still a babe,
like 30 million others.</i>

182
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,861
Want me to take
the phone?

183
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,763
<i>No, I'll take it.</i>

184
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,042
<i>She's going
to make a call.</i>

185
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,763
<i>The time is 7:10
and 40 seconds.</i>

186
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,994
New car, mink coat, and
no clocks in the joint.

187
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,731
Probably the story
of her life.

188
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,635
<i>You just don't
like women, Rick.</i>

189
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,299
What keeps
you single?

190
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,842
Maybe I like
them too much.

191
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,039
<i>We've seen all kinds
since we joined the force.</i>

192
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,742
B-girls, hustlers, blackmailers,
shoplifters, drunks.

193
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,479
<i>You know I think I'd still get married,</i>

194
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,315
if I could find
a half-honest woman.

195
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,783
Must be
a few around.

196
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,050
Watch yourself. Those
few might just be smarter.

197
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,195
<i>I don't know what makes a dame like
that tie up with a guy like Wheeler.</i>

198
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,257
Money. What else?

199
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,035
<i>She's scared. Scared of being
hungry and scared of being alone.</i>

200
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,636
You can wrap up her whole
life in that one word.

201
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,001
Money?
Hmm.

202
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,132
<i>It's nice, but it doesn't
make the world go round.</i>

203
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,334
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

204
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,637
<i>Do you know anybody that's happily married</i>

205
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,938
<i>that hasn't got
plenty of it?</i>

206
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,004
My old man was. And he had to
stand the wolf off all his life.

207
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,949
Yeah, my folks
hated each other.

208
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,315
Fighting all the time.

209
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,982
<i>It's about the only thing
I can remember about them.</i>

210
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,852
One long, endless quarrel.

211
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,289
And always
about money.

212
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,584
Never about
anything but money.

213
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,865
When I was a kid, I promised
myself that when I grew up,

214
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,161
<i>I'd have plenty
of dough.</i>

215
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,129
Plenty of it.

216
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,259
<i>I'm doing all right.</i>

217
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,102
<i>I owe the China-man $2.30
on last week's laundry bill.</i>

218
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,972
<i>How'd we get
on to this?</i>

219
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,773
I think I made a nasty crack about women.

220
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,984
<i>Paul, she's going out.</i>

221
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,350
<i>I'll take it.</i>

222
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,698
Change your mind about going out of town?

223
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,864
Yeah.

224
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,910
I took my car to have it serviced today.

225
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,549
Happened to mention the
trouble I had with it,

226
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,751
so the mechanic looked
at the distributor.

227
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,219
<i>He said it hasn't
been touched in months.</i>

228
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,699
<i>My car didn't start the other night
because you did something to it.</i>

229
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,860
Why?

230
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,165
<i>Can't think of
a fast answer?</i>

231
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,702
Yeah, I can think
of an answer.

232
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,940
I saw you walk
into the theater.

233
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,048
I liked the way
you walked.

234
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,240
As simple as that?

235
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,376
Sure, why not?

236
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,976
<i>You're a liar.</i>

237
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,283
<i>You're also a cop.</i>

238
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,019
You need a drink.

239
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,324
What do the police
want from me?

240
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,520
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

241
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,757
Harry wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

242
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,328
Harry?
Wheeler.

243
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,568
<i>He's a friend
of mine.</i>

244
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,731
Harry Wheeler
has no friends.

245
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,841
He did me
a favor once.

246
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,877
And you returned it.

247
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,743
<i>He didn't do me
that big a favor.</i>

248
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,682
<i>So you're a friend
of Harry's?</i>

249
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,945
<i>That's right.</i>

250
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,480
From St. Louis.

251
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,152
He dreamed up
a pet name for me.

252
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,554
He did that
for a lot of girls.

253
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,594
He never called me
anything else.

254
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:11,922
What was it?

255
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,493
He was kind of nervous when
I talked to him on the phone.

256
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,160
<i>He gave me your name
and address, that's all.</i>

257
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,328
A cop! A dirty,
lying cop!

258
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,464
Wait a minute, baby, take
it easy. Take it easy.

259
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,321
These last few days,

260
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,422
<i>they weren't all just cop, were they, Paul?</i>

261
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,584
No.

262
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,427
No, I learned everything I
wanted to know that first night.

263
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,397
I went on seeing you
because I wanted to.

264
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,391
<i>But it's over.</i>

265
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,599
What happens now?

266
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,574
<i>I'm taking
you downtown.</i>

267
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,107
A man named Eckstrom wants
to ask you some questions.

268
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,643
Well,

269
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,808
<i>it's been weird
knowing you.</i>

270
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,655
Not that
it matters, Paul,

271
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,021
<i>but I didn't know
that Harry was</i>

272
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,993
what he is.

273
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,589
He told me he owned
apartment houses in St. Louis.

274
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,631
He buy you
that coat?

275
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,963
Yes.

276
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,846
Who was his partner?

277
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,975
Partner? Yeah, there
were two on that bank job.

278
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,915
We only identified Wheeler.

279
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,079
<i>I told you he didn't have any friends.</i>

280
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,050
I met him at a nightclub on
the Strip. He came in alone.

281
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,358
<i>He was always alone
if he wasn't with me.</i>

282
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,689
And you let him
set up house for you?

283
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,591
All right.

284
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,895
He bought me
my clothes and my car

285
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,026
and a lease on a decent place to live in.

286
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,168
<i>Things I've never had
in my whole life.</i>

287
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,698
<i>If you'd known where his dough came from,</i>

288
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,334
would you still
have taken it?

289
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,071
<i>Money isn't dirty.
Just people.</i>

290
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,848
<i>How's he getting
in touch with you?</i>

291
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,280
<i>He'd be crazy to try and you know it. Why?</i>

292
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,515
It was just a lucky break
that we got a line on you.

293
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,421
<i>He probably figures
you're clear.</i>

294
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,187
Maybe he will try.

295
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,827
<i>I suppose my
phone's tapped.</i>

296
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,835
<i>What happens to Harry
if he's caught?</i>

297
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,529
He killed a man.

298
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,171
And the $200,000?

299
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,874
What do you think?

300
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,674
<i>I think it's
a lot of money.</i>

301
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,807
<i>And right now
Harry's got it.</i>

302
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,383
<i>That's right.</i>

303
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:49,979
Paul...

304
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,621
Go on home.

305
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,689
<i>Why?
I wouldn't know.</i>

306
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,022
Go on before I start thinking about it.

307
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,737
<i>I don't want
to go, Paul.</i>

308
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,370
Not yet.

309
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,319
We could have that money, Paul, you and I.

310
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,557
<i>Look, Harry's going to
die no matter what we do.</i>

311
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,596
<i>So what difference will it make
if he shows up and he's killed?</i>

312
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,726
<i>Be a perfect set-up
for a cop, wouldn't it?</i>

313
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,359
I could knock him off, hide the
money and call the meat wagon.

314
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,200
No questions asked.

315
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,704
Think what that money
could mean to us, Paul.

316
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,470
To you and me.

317
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,139
And I thought
I was using you.

318
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,744
Get out.

319
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,480
Get out!

320
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:43,986
<i>Where'd she go?</i>

321
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,053
Just drove around,
going no place.

322
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,658
Might have been trying to
make a contact or something.

323
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,135
She looks a little
frustrated at that.

324
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,998
Should one of us go down and relieve Paddy?

325
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,898
Hey, you with me?
What?

326
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,772
I thought one of us ought
to go down and relieve Paddy.

327
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,208
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I'll do it.</i>

328
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,710
<i>What's she doing?</i>

329
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,944
<i>Hanging drapes. Oh,
you mean Wheeler's dame.</i>

330
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,212
<i>She's sitting over there
staring at the wall.</i>

331
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,954
<i>There's a little nurse
next door. Always busy.</i>

332
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,087
<i>Hasn't stopped
moving for a minute.</i>

333
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,118
<i>Hello. What's holding you up?</i>

334
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,881
Where are you?

335
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,983
At the bowling alley.
Where else?

336
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,823
<i>Don't tell me you
forgot about it?</i>

337
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,727
<i>I'm sorry, Rick,
I did forget about it.</i>

338
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,323
I woke up this morning with a fat headache.

339
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,833
<i>I think I'd better
skip it today, huh?</i>

340
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,193
Sure.

341
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,261
<i>Brew yourself some thick black
coffee. I'll see you tonight.</i>

342
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:08,997
Right.

343
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,212
<i>Why don't
you sit down?</i>

344
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,650
Give your feet a rest.

345
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,913
<i>I'm all right.</i>

346
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,682
Are you?

347
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,489
What do you
mean by that?

348
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,959
<i>You've been looking kind of
bad the last couple of nights.</i>

349
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,325
Trouble sleeping
daytimes?

350
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,859
Yeah, yeah, the... So many
kids in the neighborhood.

351
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,236
<i>The minute I get home, take a big
double shot, and wham, I'm asleep.</i>

352
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,104
<i>I'll have to
try that.</i>

353
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,135
<i>Why don't you go down and relieve Rick?</i>

354
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,041
Right.

355
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,823
<i>But why can't
I go up to the...</i>

356
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,892
<i>Please. Thanks a lot for the ride
home, but I've got to get upstairs.</i>

357
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,766
<i>But what's your hurry? It's early yet.</i>

358
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,931
<i>I'm awfully tired.
Uh, thanks anyway.</i>

359
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:49,996
Now wait a minute.

360
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,473
<i>Look, why don't you go up
and get out of that uniform,</i>

361
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,839
<i>and we'll go out and
have a drink some place.</i>

362
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,674
Some other time. Good night. No.

363
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,373
Now just a minute.
Give me back my purse.

364
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,039
<i>I'll give it to you
when you come down. Okay?</i>

365
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,515
<i>Now you're being very
childish. Give it back.</i>

366
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,676
<i>No, you're not going to get it. Hey.</i>

367
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,151
No, I said.

368
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,812
<i>Forget it. It's not worth
it. Now wait a minute.</i>

369
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,288
<i>You're going to come down...
The lady said good night.</i>

370
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,756
<i>I guess you
didn't hear.</i>

371
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,588
<i>Why don't you mind your
own business, buddy?</i>

372
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,257
Now give the lady back
her purse and take a walk.

373
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,060
<i>Look, chum, I don't
think it's any of your...</i>

374
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,464
Be a nice fellow and
catch yourself some air.

375
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,006
Thank you.
Very much.

376
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,445
It was a pleasure.

377
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,178
<i>You did that like... As if
you'd done it before a few times.</i>

378
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,087
I was a bouncer once,
a long time ago.

379
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,122
<i>Maybe I should
learn how it's done.</i>

380
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,921
It might
come in handy.

381
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,360
<i>Wouldn't it be simpler
just to avoid that type?</i>

382
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,025
I really am grateful for what you did.

383
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,455
Never know for sure.
Some women like that kind.

384
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,157
<i>Oh, well I don't.</i>

385
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,857
<i>Not that it matters, but I
didn't have a date with him.</i>

386
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,802
<i>I'm a nurse, and he goes with a
friend of mine at the hospital.</i>

387
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,931
He offered me a lift home, and
I made a mistake and accepted it.

388
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,067
<i>You don't have to
explain it to me.</i>

389
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,743
<i>Oh, no, it's
just that I...</i>

390
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,147
<i>I guess I didn't want you
to have a bad opinion of me.</i>

391
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,443
<i>Don't ask me why.</i>

392
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,847
<i>All right, I won't.</i>

393
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,916
<i>Shouldn't I offer you a cup
of coffee or something?</i>

394
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,648
It seems the least
I could do.

395
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,553
After you learn
that hammer lock.

396
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,148
<i>I won't need it. My
roommate hasn't left yet.</i>

397
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,921
<i>She's a nurse, too.
Night shift.</i>

398
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,793
Maybe some
other time.

399
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,291
Oh. All right.
Well, good night.

400
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,958
Good night.

401
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,605
This is Paul. I may have to hang up fast.

402
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,468
Take the stairs and go up on
the roof. I want to talk to you.

403
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,148
<i>Right now. Don't even
bother to finish that drink.</i>

404
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,517
Sorry for the delay. I got tied up.

405
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,455
<i>It's all right. The girl's
going out. I'll take her.</i>

406
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,335
Over here, Paul.

407
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,584
You win.

408
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,621
<i>Couldn't have
taken much more,</i>

409
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,063
wondering what
was happening,

410
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,296
waiting for the phone to
ring and scared it might.

411
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,703
Thinking of you, wanting to
see you, wanting you to call me.

412
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,102
I know.

413
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,102
<i>This isn't going
to be easy.</i>

414
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,741
<i>We've got to keep our heads every second.</i>

415
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,581
<i>Your phone's tapped and there are
three men watching you day and night.</i>

416
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,750
<i>Harry's coming here.
Maybe tomorrow.</i>

417
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,793
Tomorrow?
That soon?

418
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,987
<i>You've got
to stop him.</i>

419
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,290
<i>How? I don't know
where he is.</i>

420
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,728
<i>Well, he'll call
first, won't he?</i>

421
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,060
Yes, but he... Well then, stall him.

422
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,794
<i>And don't answer your
phone unless I'm on the tap.</i>

423
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,392
Paul, will you
listen to me?

424
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,629
<i>It doesn't matter
if anyone hears.</i>

425
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,797
Harry told me exactly
what to say when he calls.

426
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,567
<i>And if I say anything else, he won't...</i>

427
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,507
What did he tell
you to say?

428
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,281
<i>When he calls, he'll ask me
what TV program I'm looking at.</i>

429
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,884
<i>If everything is clear, I'll
say I'm not looking at TV.</i>

430
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,390
<i>You're not
looking at TV.</i>

431
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,191
<i>Yes, and that's it.</i>

432
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,194
<i>He'll show up here
10 or 15 minutes later.</i>

433
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,957
<i>Here? Do you think he'll
have the money with him?</i>

434
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,020
Yes.

435
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,760
<i>Can't you tell him to
meet you someplace else?</i>

436
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,564
<i>No! If I say anything but what he
told me to say, it's a signal to run.</i>

437
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,904
<i>He'll show up right
after he calls?</i>

438
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,838
10 or 15
minutes later.

439
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,297
All right.

440
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,644
All right.
Now remember,

441
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,946
<i>you're not to answer your
phone until after 7:00</i>

442
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,277
<i>when I'm on the tap.</i>

443
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,782
When Wheeler calls, you
give him the all-clear.

444
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,547
Then you leave, fast.

445
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,145
<i>One man will tail you and I'll
change places with the man outside.</i>

446
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,555
Have you got an extra
key to your apartment?

447
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,957
No, but maybe...
Never mind.

448
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,086
When you go, leave the
door open so I can get in.

449
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,151
How long
do I stay away?

450
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,596
<i>You don't come back
until you call me first.</i>

451
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,396
<i>If it's all over, I'll
be there to take the call.</i>

452
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,196
<i>If you don't get
an answer, stay away.</i>

453
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,803
Have you got it
all straight?

454
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,101
Yes.
You sure?

455
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,334
Uh-huh.
All right.

456
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,501
Now go down
in your car

457
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,306
and drive around for a
while and then come back.

458
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,347
<i>I'll be right
behind you.</i>

459
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,012
<i>Couldn't I drive
to your place?</i>

460
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:08,910
No.

461
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,412
<i>No, we can't take any
more chances. Now, go on.</i>

462
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,691
Be careful, Paul.

463
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,506
Man!

464
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,874
The redhead
on the third floor?

465
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,571
<i>Isn't that the most...</i>

466
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,206
Well, you only get out of a sweater
what you put into it, I always say.

467
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,772
Yeah. You said it
twice this morning.

468
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,750
Let me have a look.

469
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,225
Answer your
phone, Blondie.

470
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,141
<i>What's going on?</i>

471
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,678
Still in the bedroom.

472
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,873
<i>She's not going
to answer it.</i>

473
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,445
<i>That's funny.</i>

474
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,354
You just missed
something.

475
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,428
What happened?
Her phone rang,

476
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,588
half a dozen times.

477
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,131
She just
ignored it.

478
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,188
<i>How'd she react?</i>

479
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,234
<i>Couldn't tell. She was in the bedroom.</i>

480
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,893
Maybe she knows
her phone is tapped.

481
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,201
<i>You're sure she wasn't in
the shower or something?</i>

482
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,968
Just stood in the bedroom
and stared at the phone.

483
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,067
Almost hate
to leave.

484
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,543
This may be
the big night.

485
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,103
Yeah. I can hardly tear myself away.

486
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,714
Well, enjoy
the view.

487
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,115
<i>We'll see you.
Good night.</i>

488
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,278
If that call was supposed
to mean something,

489
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,153
<i>she isn't
showing it.</i>

490
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,121
<i>Probably
her roommate's party.</i>

491
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,096
Must be her night off
or something.

492
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,025
<i>How do you know
it isn't her party?</i>

493
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,498
<i>She's tired.</i>

494
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,537
I saw her come home
tonight, and she was beat.

495
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,470
<i>You'd never know it
to look at her now.</i>

496
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,746
Well, this thing will
probably go on all night.

497
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,342
What do you care?

498
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,407
<i>I don't.</i>

499
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:36,019
Maybe I do. I find myself watching
her like I was her father or something.

500
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,827
I wait for her
to come home.

501
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,420
<i>When she's late,
I worry about her,</i>

502
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,398
<i>wonder what
she's doing.</i>

503
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,627
<i>And, uh, who she's doing
it with. Is that the idea?</i>

504
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,835
Yeah, something like that.

505
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,002
At least I feel I know
her well enough to...

506
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,377
<i>She's going
to answer it.</i>

507
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,145
<i>Hello.</i>

508
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,551
<i>Good evening. This is
the RTV Rating Service.</i>

509
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,955
<i>Would you tell me what program
you're watching right now?</i>

510
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,788
<i>TVprogram, that is.</i>

511
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,618
<i>I'm not watching TV.</i>

512
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,797
<i>I see. Thank you.</i>

513
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,565
Did you ever hear
of an RTV Rating Service?

514
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,764
No.

515
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,363
<i>See what she's doing.</i>

516
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,105
<i>She's gone
into the bedroom.</i>

517
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,713
<i>She's going out, Paul.
This may be it.</i>

518
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,051
Like me to take her
this time?

519
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,144
<i>I'd give my right arm to nail
that babe and her boyfriend.</i>

520
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,712
Okay, Rick. Go ahead. Good luck.

521
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,698
<i>Operator.
Mobile operator.</i>

522
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,529
<i>One moment, please.</i>

523
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,969
<i>Mobile operator.</i>

524
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,471
Give me
WJ 8-2-3-1-1.

525
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:30,897
<i>Your name and number?</i>

526
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,671
Sheridan.
Hollywood 9-5-2-6-4.

527
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,835
Hurry it up, please.

528
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,004
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

529
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,388
<i>There's no answer, sir.</i>

530
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,686
No answer?

531
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,920
<i>There's got to be an answer. Try it again.</i>

532
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,196
<i>Yes, sir.
WJ 8-2-3-1-1.</i>

533
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,072
<i>What's up, Paul? Your
job, that's what's up.</i>

534
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,875
<i>The effects from... I'm sorry,
Paul, but all I did was...</i>

535
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,744
<i>I know. We'll talk
about it later.</i>

536
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,181
<i>I'll take over in the car. You go upstairs.</i>

537
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,185
Sure, Paul, but I...

538
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,354
What is it?
Wheeler.

539
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,596
<i>He's gone in. We've got to call Rick.</i>

540
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:08,933
<i>No! No, Rick's
not up there.</i>

541
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,234
<i>The girl went out.
He's tailing her.</i>

542
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,002
<i>Then what'll we do?</i>

543
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,269
Well?

544
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,469
<i>When he finds out
she's not up there,</i>

545
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,537
he may get scared
and run.

546
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,512
<i>If he doesn't, we'll go up
and take him there. Come on.</i>

547
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:38,097
<i>Eckstrom don't need to know
about what happened, does he?</i>

548
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,859
What?
Eckstrom.

549
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,567
Does he have to
know about...

550
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,965
If nothing
goes wrong, no.

551
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,156
<i>I don't want to lose
my pension, Paul.</i>

552
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,388
But I

553
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,530
<i>guess you'll do
what you got to do.</i>

554
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,698
<i>I'll give you
every break I can.</i>

555
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,269
<i>If you'd been on the job, I'd
have taken him at the elevator,</i>

556
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,368
the way Eckstrom
wanted it.

557
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,413
You better hope
nothing goes wrong.

558
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,098
Hold it, Wheeler!
I got him!

559
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,661
<i>Now, let's go.</i>

560
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,964
Where?
Downtown.

561
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,010
<i>But first we'll pick up the money, huh?</i>

562
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,510
You got it
in your car?

563
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,481
<i>Let's go
find out, huh?</i>

564
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,530
This it?
Yeah.

565
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,296
Locked?
Yeah.

566
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,132
<i>Let's have
the keys.</i>

567
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,450
Looks like
the whole bundle.

568
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,080
<i>What'd you do with your
partner, Wheeler? Kill him?</i>

569
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,255
Okay, Paddy,
close the satchel.

570
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,063
What happened? He jumped you. What else?

571
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,502
<i>Why'd you shoot him?
I could have handled him.</i>

572
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,507
<i>Why, you're half-drunk. For
all I knew he had your gun.</i>

573
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,034
<i>Well, what now?
I don't know.</i>

574
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:37,239
Eckstrom will crucify us.
He wanted him alive.

575
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,872
<i>There'll only
be one goat.</i>

576
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,041
Me.

577
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,273
No.

578
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,380
<i>No, there's a way out.
Give me a hand, Paddy.</i>

579
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,150
<i>What're you doing?
I'm saving your skin.</i>

580
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,523
<i>Tomorrow, I'll drive the
car someplace and leave it.</i>

581
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,656
<i>They'll find it and we'll be in the clear.</i>

582
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,996
All we have to do is keep our mouths shut.

583
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,930
<i>What's the gimmick?</i>

584
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,071
Gimmick? You doing all this for me?

585
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,835
Why not?

586
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,472
<i>I don't know.</i>

587
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,605
<i>But I'd rather lose
my pension than...</i>

588
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,447
When they find Wheeler, will
they find that money, too?

589
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,946
What kind
of a crack is that?

590
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,652
<i>Maybe I'd better call Eckstrom right now?</i>

591
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:19,984
I gotta know, Paul.

592
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,251
I gotta know the money will be there.

593
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,088
Sure, it will be there!

594
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,227
Then give me
the keys.

595
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,123
<i>We'll both drive the car away tomorrow.</i>

596
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,798
Okay, Paddy.

597
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,125
You keep them.

598
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,062
<i>We'd better get back.</i>

599
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,612
<i>What'll it be?</i>

600
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,672
Same as hers.

601
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:28,978
Hello.

602
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,999
<i>I'm afraid I gave you
the wrong impression.</i>

603
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,101
I doubt it.

604
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,375
No really, you remind me of someone.

605
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,046
<i>Haven't you
ever met me before?</i>

606
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,983
Hundreds of times.

607
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,184
<i>I don't get it.</i>

608
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,655
<i>And you won't,
so try someplace else.</i>

609
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:09,248
<i>No. You've got
the wrong idea.</i>

610
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,920
<i>I'm not just fresh, I'm sure
that I've met you someplace.</i>

611
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,957
What...

612
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,889
Uh, will there be
anything else, sir?

613
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,314
<i>Hello.
It's me, Paul.</i>

614
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,220
<i>It's done.</i>

615
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:39,755
Is everything all right?

616
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,723
<i>There's a complication,
but I can handle it.</i>

617
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,224
Get back here.

618
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,352
<i>What happened? I'll talk to you later.</i>

619
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,427
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

620
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,628
<i>We're having a little party next
door and ran out of ice cubes.</i>

621
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,103
<i>Could I borrow some? I'm
sorry. I can't help you.</i>

622
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,245
<i>How'd it go, Rick?</i>

623
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:48,223
Another dry run.
I think she spotted me.

624
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,417
Why?

625
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,324
She made a call from the Twilight
Room and came right back here.

626
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,363
<i>It means she spotted me or
knows her phone's tapped.</i>

627
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,557
Or both.

628
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,259
Or neither.
Maybe.

629
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,600
<i>Hey, you're up
kind of late, Lieutenant.</i>

630
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,864
Something break?

631
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:02,927
<i>Our man's in town.</i>

632
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:07,404
Spotted in a drug store on the
east side earlier this evening.

633
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,242
<i>I'd hoped you might
have him here for me.</i>

634
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,802
<i>Well, we'd hoped
the same thing.</i>

635
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,472
<i>I'm afraid
I haven't.</i>

636
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,675
Why not?

637
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,513
<i>The dame acts like she
knows her phone's tapped.</i>

638
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,143
Made a call
from a bar tonight.

639
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,120
Probably touted
him off.

640
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,020
<i>Then you've
been here alone.</i>

641
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,025
For the last
hour, yeah.

642
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,424
All quiet?

643
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,758
<i>Her phone rang once. That's all.</i>

644
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,828
Check the neighborhood,
Sheridan.

645
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,925
Parked cars, alleys.

646
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,163
<i>I'll wait here
a while.</i>

647
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,564
Right.

648
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,683
What time did you leave
tonight, Rick, to tail her?

649
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,015
About 10:30.

650
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,552
What time did you
get back?

651
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,556
A minute ago. Why?

652
00:54:56,192 --> 00:55:00,094
I phoned here a half dozen
times between 10:50 and 11:15.

653
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,561
No answer.

654
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,225
Some thing from the car parked outside.

655
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,460
<i>I gave him a chance to
explain. Why didn't he?</i>

656
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,596
Talk to Paddy?

657
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,805
He had nothing
to offer either.

658
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,709
<i>But he's scared
to death.</i>

659
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,706
<i>You and Sheridan are
fairly close, aren't you?</i>

660
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,316
<i>That's right.</i>

661
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,444
<i>But I'm not trying
to cover for him.</i>

662
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,318
<i>Maybe Paul's trying to
do it for Dolan.</i>

663
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,652
Why?

664
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:29,885
Why not ask Dolan?

665
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,585
<i>I'm asking you.
And I want an answer.</i>

666
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,391
When I followed her I
drove past the lookout car.

667
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,626
<i>Paddy wasn't in it.</i>

668
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,562
When I got to
the intersection,

669
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,271
I saw him go
into a bar.

670
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,100
I guess that bar was
just a little too close.

671
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,611
Paul, we... Shut up
and get back in the car.

672
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,390
Eckstrom talk to you?

673
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,831
<i>He knows something's
up. What'd you tell him?</i>

674
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,265
<i>Nothing I didn't
have to. He knew.</i>

675
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,565
<i>He doesn't know anything.
He just thinks he does.</i>

676
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,367
He gave me a phony job
to get me out of the room.

677
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,239
<i>Give me the keys
to Wheeler's car.</i>

678
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:22,107
<i>I'll get it out of here while
we've still got a chance.</i>

679
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,736
Come on!
Give me the keys!

680
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,304
<i>We're only making things worse, Paul.</i>

681
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,517
<i>I'm goin' up and tell Eckstrom
just the way it happened.</i>

682
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,177
<i>You're not going
to tell him anything.</i>

683
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,050
<i>I'm in this, too,
remember?</i>

684
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,347
Why?

685
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,715
<i>You were just
coverin' for me.</i>

686
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,623
<i>Isn't that right? And
Eckstrom'll throw the book at me.</i>

687
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,683
<i>Who do you think
you're kiddin'?</i>

688
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,923
<i>You'll come out
sweet as a rose.</i>

689
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,395
A hero for trying
to protect a buddy.

690
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:46,026
<i>Look, Paddy, Eckstrom
can't prove a thing.</i>

691
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,131
Why throw away
your pension?

692
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:51,640
Because I spent 25 years
being a dumb, honest cop.

693
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,133
<i>And I'm stuck with it. Wait a minute.</i>

694
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,083
<i>What's the idea?</i>

695
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,085
<i>You didn't do
anything for me.</i>

696
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,449
<i>You're after
that dough.</i>

697
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,922
<i>That's why you came down looking for me.</i>

698
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,422
You knew Wheeler
was going to show.

699
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,084
Now wait a minute, Paddy.

700
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,289
<i>Nope. We're both going up
and tell it just like it...</i>

701
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,701
<i>Doesn't answer.
Come on.</i>

702
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,974
<i>Tell 'em to get here as fast
as they can, but no sirens.</i>

703
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,103
And keep this
from the press boys!

704
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,879
I heard a shot!

705
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,252
Paddy?

706
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,356
Dead?

707
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,426
Rick, get those people
back to bed.

708
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,135
<i>We don't want a crowd
around here.</i>

709
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,597
All right, folks,
back on the sidewalk.

710
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,071
<i>What's going on, officer?
We heard the shot.</i>

711
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,574
Just a slight accident.
Back on the sidewalk, please.

712
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,907
<i>What do you think?
I don't know.</i>

713
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,912
Powder burns,
his own gun.

714
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,447
Why would he
kill himself?

715
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,176
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

716
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,842
<i>Then you think
he didn't?</i>

717
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,086
Where were you tonight
around 11:00?

718
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,653
I was upstairs. Why?

719
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,096
<i>No, you weren't.</i>

720
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,361
We know where Dolan was. Where were you?

721
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,096
You know
where Dolan was?

722
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,899
McAllister saw him.

723
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,798
<i>I told him
I'd cover for him.</i>

724
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,509
<i>I tried to get him on the car
phone about 10:30, he didn't answer.</i>

725
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,602
I know.

726
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,579
The operator gave me
the message just now.

727
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,307
I came down to see what
had happened to him.

728
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,317
<i>Found he'd gone over to the bar.</i>

729
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,910
He was scared. He kept
talking about his pension.

730
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,053
I brought him back here.

731
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:57,024
<i>I tried to make him understand
I wouldn't say anything,</i>

732
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,893
<i>but I guess
he wasn't listening.</i>

733
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,289
<i>Well, you'd better
get back upstairs.</i>

734
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:04,799
<i>We've still got
a job to do here.</i>

735
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:05,959
Yeah.

736
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:15,544
<i>There's not much point keeping
a stakeout now, is there?</i>

737
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,737
You got any
better ideas?

738
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,994
Yeah, right away.

739
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,422
<i>Oh, look, there's
been an accident.</i>

740
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,516
Wonder what happened?

741
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:04,890
Wanna go over?
Maybe you can help.

742
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:05,950
<i>No, they don't
need us.</i>

743
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,155
<i>They'd be the first to say so.</i>

744
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,629
<i>Oh, it's so late.</i>

745
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:09,960
Come on.

746
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,331
<i>Are you sure you won't change
your mind and come with us, Ann?</i>

747
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,494
No, you all go on.

748
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:14,558
All right.
And have fun.

749
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,127
<i>You know the Crockett's
number if you need me.</i>

750
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,365
<i>Oh, don't worry.</i>

751
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,839
Give us a call. All right. Bye.

752
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,172
Nighty night.
Bye.

753
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:49,998
<i>He's dead.
I shot him.</i>

754
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,097
What do you mean?
Paddy Dolan.

755
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,334
What happened?
I killed him.

756
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,898
The poor, dumb, harmless...

757
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,102
He pulled a gun on me.

758
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,975
It went off. It was
an accident. I...

759
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,682
Are they after you?
No.

760
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,056
<i>But everything's
gone wrong.</i>

761
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,286
Paddy and...

762
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,419
And that
girl downstairs,

763
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,327
she saw me in your apartment. What girl?

764
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,422
The one that lives
next to you. The nurse.

765
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,297
<i>Does she know who you
are? I don't think so.</i>

766
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,960
<i>But she'll remember me.
She'll remember me good.</i>

767
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,595
<i>Paul, look, we've got the
money. Why don't we get out now?</i>

768
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,970
<i>We haven't got the money! The car's gone.</i>

769
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,009
How? Paddy must have moved it.

770
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:28,968
<i>He couldn't have
moved it far.</i>

771
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,512
It must be around here
someplace close.

772
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,573
Maybe we could
spot it from up here.

773
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,346
<i>McAllister's
still down there.</i>

774
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,720
<i>You take that side.
I'll look over here.</i>

775
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,521
Go on upstairs, Rick.

776
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,627
<i>Who tells
Paddy's wife?</i>

777
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,294
That goes with my job.

778
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,390
What are you going to
say? He killed himself?

779
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,731
What else can I say?

780
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,770
Get those people
out of there.

781
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,548
Anything serious?

782
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,513
No.

783
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,494
<i>You know, you're a bitter
disappointment to me.</i>

784
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,662
Oh?

785
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,329
The other night.

786
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,397
You were just
doing your job.

787
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,703
<i>You are a policeman,
aren't you?</i>

788
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:17,945
Paul!

789
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:22,915
<i>That's it.</i>

790
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,358
Go down to your apartment, stay
there a few minutes, and then leave.

791
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,453
I want the man that follows
you kept out at least an hour.

792
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,519
What are you going to do?

793
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,498
<i>I'm going to put Wheeler's body
where it'll be found tonight.</i>

794
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,056
Why? Why take
any chance now?

795
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,897
<i>Tomorrow we... I can't do
it in the broad daylight.</i>

796
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,029
<i>And if that girl sees
me again, I'm through.</i>

797
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:39,802
<i>When they find the body, the stakeout
will be over and I'll be away from here.</i>

798
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,002
<i>Everything's going to
be all right? Sure. Sure.</i>

799
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,914
You have a wonderful way
of sidestepping questions.

800
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,319
Shall I just stop
asking them?

801
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,980
Right now, yes.

802
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,549
But save them
for next week.

803
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,559
Next week?

804
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,161
<i>You wouldn't be
asking for a date?</i>

805
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,365
<i>I can't even answer
that for sure.</i>

806
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,401
Is your name
in the book?

807
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,260
<i>Ann Stewart,
with a "W."</i>

808
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:09,463
<i>But you'd better call me at the hospital.</i>

809
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,233
After our party tonight,
we may be evicted.

810
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:12,365
Was it that bad?

811
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,875
<i>I didn't think so, but the
people next door apparently did.</i>

812
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,103
People next door.

813
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,941
<i>You don't mean 423?</i>

814
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,407
Yes. Why not?
What happened?

815
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,743
Well, nothing, really. I went over
to borrow some ice cubes from him.

816
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,014
<i>Him? You mean
her, don't you?</i>

817
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,049
No, I mean him.

818
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,996
What time was it?

819
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,402
Well, about 11:00.

820
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,566
Is he important?

821
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:49,509
He may have killed a man
last week and another tonight.

822
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,311
Do you think you could recognize
him if you saw him again?

823
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,852
Yes. I think I could.

824
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,725
<i>Then you'll be hearing from
me sooner than I thought.</i>

825
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,124
Good night.

826
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,863
Wheeler was here.
In her apartment.

827
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,866
When? When you were out looking for Paddy.

828
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,236
<i>How'd you find out
about it?</i>

829
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,337
The nurse. She tried to
borrow some ice cubes.

830
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,507
He gave her
a fast brush-off.

831
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:28,981
223 please.

832
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,179
Mitchell?

833
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,016
When Eckstrom gets in,
have him call me.

834
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,287
McAllister. Right.

835
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,752
Could she
identify him?

836
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,795
Well, who else
could it be?

837
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,523
<i>What's the
blonde doing?</i>

838
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:43,030
The usual things.

839
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,795
<i>If there's anybody in there
with her, she doesn't know it.</i>

840
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,562
Do you think the nurse
scared him off?

841
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,465
<i>I don't know.</i>

842
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,403
She said he opened the
door before she knocked,

843
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:54,966
as if he was leaving.

844
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,109
<i>Well, then when he found
out his girl wasn't up there,</i>

845
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,203
<i>he probably got nervous
and... That's just it.</i>

846
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,838
<i>Why wasn't she?</i>

847
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,983
<i>I can't spot it, but
something's wrong somewhere.</i>

848
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,320
<i>And what happened to Paddy,
that doesn't fit either.</i>

849
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,858
Eckstrom must have scared
him out of his mind.

850
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,457
Do you really think
Paddy killed himself?

851
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,622
If you were going to check out,
would you put a.38 slug in your belly?

852
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,290
Nobody kills
himself like that.

853
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,833
Least of all a cop.

854
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:20,766
I know Paddy like
I know my own self.

855
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,270
<i>He wouldn't have done it. Not
that way, or any other way.</i>

856
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,967
<i>And he certainly wouldn't have
let Wheeler get that close.</i>

857
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,373
Maybe he did.

858
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,467
No.

859
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,007
You know
what I think, Paul.

860
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,916
I think whoever killed Paddy was
right there in the car with him.

861
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,419
Sitting right there
beside him.

862
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,018
Hello.

863
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,717
All right,
give him a message.

864
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,626
Wheeler paid us a visit
about 11:00 tonight.

865
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,688
The lady in
apartment 426.

866
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,766
Yeah, she went over
to borrow some ice cubes.

867
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:33,025
She there?

868
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,527
<i>She just came in.
Where'd she go?</i>

869
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,397
Nowhere. Anything
happen over there?

870
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,196
<i>No, it's all quiet.</i>

871
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:42,665
Know where she went?

872
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,228
To the beach.

873
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,334
Looked at the water
exactly three minutes,

874
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,206
came right back here.

875
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,038
Why?

876
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:52,102
<i>It doesn't
make sense.</i>

877
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,842
<i>Well, she probably figured
there's only one man</i>

878
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,281
watching her place,
wanted to draw him off.

879
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:56,545
Why? Nothing
happened over there,

880
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,951
<i>and Schaeffer didn't
see anything outside.</i>

881
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,217
<i>Rick, you'd better
come with me.</i>

882
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,090
<i>We've got
work to do.</i>

883
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,491
<i>Wheeler's dead.
What happened?</i>

884
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,292
Two.38 slugs
in the back.

885
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,764
Where? When?

886
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:48,394
Dumped out of a car on Third and
Wilmer, about a half an hour ago.

887
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,196
<i>Doesn't she ever
go to bed?</i>

888
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,468
<i>We're going over there
and get a few answers.</i>

889
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:55,703
You stay here Paul.

890
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,406
<i>It'll go smoother if she
doesn't see you just now.</i>

891
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,564
Hello.
This is Paul.

892
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:21,929
Now, listen.

893
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,198
McAllister and Eckstrom are
on their way over to see you.

894
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,262
<i>They'll be there
in a minute.</i>

895
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,241
<i>They'll ask you a lot of questions,
but they don't know a thing.</i>

896
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,606
<i>So don't let them
scare you.</i>

897
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:30,911
<i>No, I'll be over here.</i>

898
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,209
But in case you do see me,
you know me. Remember that?

899
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,909
All right, Paul.

900
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,486
Who is it?
Police.

901
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,801
<i>Where does he
think he's going?</i>

902
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,236
What is this anyway? Routine check.

903
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:02,641
<i>We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Harry Wheeler.</i>

904
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,073
Get him out
of my bedroom.

905
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,512
All right.

906
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,971
<i>Won't you sit down,
Miss McLane?</i>

907
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,335
May I?

908
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,777
When was the last time
you heard from him?

909
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,508
Who?
Harry Wheeler.

910
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:43,246
<i>Who's Harry Wheeler?</i>

911
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,552
<i>He's been getting some
space in this week's papers.</i>

912
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:49,381
<i>I'm afraid I don't
read the paper.</i>

913
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,949
<i>And I don't know
anyone named Harry.</i>

914
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:55,296
<i>Don't you have to know a man to
give him a key to your apartment?</i>

915
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,161
<i>What's that
supposed to mean?</i>

916
01:13:57,232 --> 01:14:00,463
Harry Wheeler was in this
apartment tonight at 11:00.

917
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:01,967
<i>I wasn't even
here at 11:00.</i>

918
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:04,335
No, you were at
the Twilight Room.

919
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:05,771
But there was
a man here.

920
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,240
<i>If it wasn't Wheeler,
who was it?</i>

921
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:11,077
If there was anyone
here, he broke in.

922
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,478
What did Wheeler
come up here for?

923
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,048
<i>Maybe it wasn't Wheeler.</i>

924
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,676
<i>You knew his partner,
too, didn't you?</i>

925
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,015
No sale.

926
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:21,921
<i>You didn't find what you were looking for,</i>

927
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,981
<i>so why don't you
let me go to bed?</i>

928
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:27,586
<i>I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you, Lona.</i>

929
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:30,028
<i>Wheeler's partner
double-crossed him,</i>

930
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,658
which means he double-crossed you, too.

931
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:36,431
He shot Wheeler tonight and
dumped his body into the street.

932
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,397
Which means
nothing to me.

933
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,876
<i>If I didn't know better, I'd
think we were on the wrong track.</i>

934
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,216
Call the stakeout. Have
him bring over the log.

935
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,012
<i>We've been keeping
a score sheet on you.</i>

936
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,847
<i>We'll go over it together,
point by point.</i>

937
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,559
Sheridan.

938
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,433
Rick. Eckstrom wants the log brought over.

939
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:10,664
<i>I'll be right over.</i>

940
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,134
Hello, Lona.

941
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,135
<i>I might've known.</i>

942
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,079
<i>You're just the type.</i>

943
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:30,842
You want me
to stick around?

944
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,614
<i>Afraid she doesn't
like you, Paul?</i>

945
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:33,882
Better wait for us.
Right.

946
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,807
Operator?
Give me the police.

947
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:02,941
Hurry!

948
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,176
<i>Cars 49 and 60,</i>

949
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:07,773
<i>Park Crest Hotel, 322
French Street. Code Three.</i>

950
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:12,878
Sheridan.
Eckstrom there?

951
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,783
<i>Well, you'd better go
over and give him this.</i>

952
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,449
A woman in the building,

953
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:20,357
an Ann Stewart,
apartment 421.

954
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,056
She just called in.

955
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,564
<i>Says she saw the man we're
after. Whatever that means.</i>

956
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:27,261
Oh, and...
Yeah, two more cars.

957
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,764
She mentioned McAllister,
so it may be a break.

958
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,238
Yeah, you never know.

959
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,102
Okay.

960
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:13,770
<i>Who's there?</i>

961
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,514
Miss Ann Stewart?

962
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,676
Yes?

963
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,583
The police.
Did you put in a call?

964
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,223
<i>...no reason. When I can't sleep, I drive.</i>

965
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,660
Who pays your rent?

966
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,129
I do!
How?

967
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,257
What about the call
you got from RTV?

968
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,631
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

969
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,567
<i>It wasn't the rating service
that called. We checked on it.</i>

970
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:37,104
Who was it?

971
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:38,867
<i>If there was a call,
I don't remember it.</i>

972
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,342
<i>Now, if you do as you're
told, you won't get hurt.</i>

973
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,741
What are you
going to do?

974
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,782
<i>Well, think it over.
You've got until tomorrow.</i>

975
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,550
<i>But don't try to leave unless
you want to be picked up</i>

976
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,114
and booked for vagrancy.

977
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,299
Get your coat.

978
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:10,395
Come on! Come on!

979
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:22,812
Sheridan?

980
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,215
I guess
he went downstairs.

981
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,448
Yeah.

982
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,766
<i>Yes?
It's Paul. Open up.</i>

983
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,607
Turn the lights out first.

984
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,139
<i>Get dressed, we're getting out of here.</i>

985
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,981
Go on, hurry!

986
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,858
<i>Where's Sheridan?
Upstairs.</i>

987
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,195
<i>If he was upstairs I wouldn't
be asking you about him.</i>

988
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,632
<i>Didn't he just
give you a message?</i>

989
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,033
What are you talking about? What message?

990
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:17,901
<i>A woman called. Said she saw
the guy we're looking for.</i>

991
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:18,997
What was her name?

992
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,701
Stewart. 421...

993
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,641
Ann!

994
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:31,303
All right. All right, now
go out... Hold on a second.

995
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:36,050
<i>Sheridan, the blonde, the girl who
just called in, they're all missing!</i>

996
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:40,046
You and Schaeffer search
the building, top to bottom.

997
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,679
Who are we after?

998
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:45,419
Maybe Paul Sheridan. Take a
prowl car and cover the back.

999
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,872
<i>What's wrong? A prowl car
right behind Wheeler's.</i>

1000
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,036
<i>Do you think they know
it's Harry's car?</i>

1001
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:38,272
<i>I don't know.</i>

1002
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,109
Maybe they just
happened to park there.

1003
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,682
<i>There's one way
to find out. Here,</i>

1004
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,151
<i>that car over there,
here's the key to the trunk.</i>

1005
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,554
<i>Open it. You'll find a bag, bring it here.</i>

1006
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:50,716
Take it!

1007
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,420
Be smart.

1008
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:19,983
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

1009
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,647
When I fire,
get behind the car.

1010
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,379
Duck!

1011
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,705
<i>It's clear that way. Go to Western
and Wilshire, wait for me there.</i>

1012
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,107
<i>What are you going to do?
I'm going to get that car.</i>

1013
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,770
<i>Now go on hurry! No, wait!
You can't get that money!</i>

1014
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:46,108
<i>Will you go, Lona?
Please, don't try to get...</i>

1015
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,239
Go on!

1016
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,072
Hold it, Sheridan!

1017
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,722
Radio George Street,
emergency.

1018
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,527
<i>I'm sorry, Rick.</i>

1019
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:44,936
So am I, Paul. So am I.

1020
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:35,017
I thought
I told you to go.

1021
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:43,163
<i>We really didn't need that money, did we?</i>

1022
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,129
<i>Come on,
I'll walk you home.</i>
