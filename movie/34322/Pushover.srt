1
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,572
Need some help?

2
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,275
<i>Maybe you've got
the motor flooded.</i>

3
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,714
What do I do
about it?

4
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:08,410
Want me to try?

5
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:11,086
All right.

6
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,689
Shove over.

7
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:21,894
Did you like
the show?

8
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,126
Yeah.

9
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,801
How did you know
I was there?

10
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:28,266
I saw you. Wondered why you were alone.

11
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,503
I wondered the same thing about you.

12
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,143
<i>It doesn't seem
to be flooded.</i>

13
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:40,208
<i>I'll take a look
under the hood.</i>

14
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:07,371
<i>I don't know. I don't think
you're getting any spark.</i>

15
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:10,342
<i>I'm not?</i>

16
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,247
Not enough to
start the car.

17
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:15,642
Any suggestions?

18
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,583
Yeah, I think you ought to
have a mechanic look at it.

19
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,021
<i>There's an all-night
garage on Normandie.</i>

20
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,321
You could call them
from a bar over here.

21
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,092
All right.

22
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,994
<i>I'd feel much better
if you went with me.</i>

23
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,103
That was the idea.

24
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,807
Another drink?

25
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,321
You could play the record again, though.

26
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:52,915
Okay.

27
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,859
Oh. Did you get it started?

28
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:57,225
<i>Have to tow it in
to the shop, ma'am.</i>

29
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:58,923
<i>I can't seem to locate the trouble.</i>

30
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:00,390
How long will
that take?

31
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,898
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

32
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,866
Could I call
you here?

33
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,403
Bartender, what
time do you close?

34
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,098
<i>12:00. We don't get much late trade.</i>

35
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,898
<i>All right. I guess we'll have to call you.</i>

36
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,101
Okay.

37
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,675
Well...

38
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,548
You like to
take me home?

39
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:18,107
Now?

40
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,511
Sure.

41
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:31,958
Your place
or mine?

42
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:34,664
Surprise me.

43
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:42,565
Yeah.

44
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:48,005
<i>Well, there's
no particular hurry.</i>

45
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,916
<i>Well, why don't you check with
the mechanic and call me back?</i>

46
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:53,911
Hollywood 33-449.

47
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:56,347
Right.

48
00:07:58,757 --> 00:07:59,781
Mind?

49
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:01,519
No, help yourself.

50
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,064
<i>That was with plain water, wasn't it?</i>

51
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:14,366
Uh-huh.

52
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,138
Sorry?

53
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,404
Sorry? For what?

54
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:23,876
Picking me up.

55
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:26,616
Is that what you
call it, a pick-up?

56
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,016
<i>Don't you?</i>

57
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,046
Do you get
picked up often?

58
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,448
Would you care?

59
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:42,126
<i>If I said yes, it wouldn't
make much sense, would it?</i>

60
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,125
No.

61
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:47,061
<i>I guess it wouldn't.</i>

62
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,139
<i>The answer's yes.</i>

63
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:04,183
<i>Would it make any sense if I told
you it's never happened before?</i>

64
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,650
Maybe.

65
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:22,533
Funny.

66
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,472
When I saw you come into
the theater tonight, I...

67
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:27,676
I thought how
awful it was.

68
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,179
The two of us
there all alone.

69
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:31,807
<i>It doesn't make sense,
a girl like you.</i>

70
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,942
New car, mink coat.

71
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,418
Perfume,
$50 an ounce.

72
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,476
<i>It's $100.</i>

73
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:39,280
Still alone. Why?

74
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,583
Uh-uh.

75
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,419
<i>No questions.
Don't spoil it.</i>

76
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,024
Yeah.

77
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:51,635
How long
will it take?

78
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,028
Wait a minute.

79
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,466
<i>He says the
distributor's shot.</i>

80
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,907
Take a couple of hours,
maybe longer, to fix it.

81
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:01,336
He wants to know
where to deliver it.

82
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,404
You tell him.

83
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,251
You can deliver it here. 3916
Crescent Way, apartment D.

84
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,549
Right.

85
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,711
<i>We're doing
the best we can.</i>

86
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:38,749
After all, identifying Harry
Wheeler as one of the men

87
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:42,014
who knocked off the bank
was no break, it was...

88
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:44,985
Yes, sir.

89
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:48,055
All right, sir,
as soon as I get it.

90
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,622
What about you, Rick?
Anything from St. Louis?

91
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,961
<i>Wheeler was there till five
weeks ago. That's all we got.</i>

92
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,058
Nothing on who he left with? Why he left?

93
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,932
<i>They're working on it.</i>

94
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:01,995
About time
you showed.

95
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:03,097
Have you got
anything for us?

96
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,699
Well, nothing
definite, no.

97
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:06,710
What do you want? Another
three days with her?

98
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:08,473
<i>I didn't ask for
the first three.</i>

99
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:10,947
<i>Okay, Paul. We've been
drawing blanks here, too.</i>

100
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,007
You can have more time
with her if you need it.

101
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,177
<i>I'm satisfied
she's Wheeler's girl.</i>

102
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,680
Oh? Why?

103
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:19,053
Well, it seems to add up. We
spend a lot of time at my place,

104
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:20,148
never at hers.

105
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:21,817
She obviously has
a generous friend

106
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:23,258
<i>who's not around
at the moment.</i>

107
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,296
Last night, when I tried to
take her to the Lombardy Club,

108
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:26,694
she backed off.

109
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:27,856
<i>What's
the connection?</i>

110
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,525
<i>It's one of
Wheeler's hangouts.</i>

111
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,296
<i>You think that's
enough to go on?</i>

112
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:32,836
<i>Don't you?</i>

113
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:34,871
<i>lt'll have to do.</i>

114
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,703
Harris, bring in
that layout.

115
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,737
Oh, what about
the girl?

116
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:41,568
I told her I was going to
be out of town for a while.

117
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,908
<i>Oh, I got this from the bank
yesterday. It's the official count.</i>

118
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:48,009
$210,000, and no record
of the serial numbers.

119
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:52,082
This is a layout of the
building the girl lives in.

120
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:53,522
This is her
apartment here.

121
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,492
<i>We'll take over this one across the way.</i>

122
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,824
Be sure you avoid contact
with the rest of the tenants.

123
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,761
<i>There'll be two men in
this room at all times,</i>

124
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,299
one on the phone tap,
the other at the window.

125
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,733
Another man will be in the
lookout car out in front.

126
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:07,067
If Wheeler shows, the man in
the lookout car phones upstairs

127
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:08,469
and the other two
will be ready for him

128
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,201
when he steps out
of the elevator.

129
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,572
Sounds real simple.

130
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:12,632
It is.

131
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,646
<i>If you ask me, Wheeler's
halfway to Peru right now.</i>

132
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,375
All that dough and a
murder rap hanging over him.

133
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,716
<i>Look, get it out of your
head that Wheeler won't show.</i>

134
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:26,023
<i>This is all we've got to go on,
and I want you expecting him.</i>

135
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,116
Did you ever read the
statistics on bank jobs, Paddy?

136
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:30,794
Ever hear of a heist
man being picked up

137
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:33,956
afterward on a highway
or international border?

138
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:35,862
They find them holed up in the big city.

139
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,767
<i>And 70% of the time,
there's a dame with them.</i>

140
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,131
How about it, Paul?

141
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:43,071
Think Wheeler
will be around?

142
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,732
<i>Yeah, he'll be around.</i>

143
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,474
Everything
straight then?

144
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,408
How about those back
doors? They kept locked?

145
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:52,382
<i>They can't be opened from the outside.</i>

146
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,350
<i>You'll be in charge
of the stakeout, Paul.</i>

147
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,182
And you know
what I want.

148
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:58,814
You want Wheeler.
I want him alive.

149
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:00,718
Remember that,
all of you.

150
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:04,022
<i>Dead, he can't tell us where the
money is or who his partner was.</i>

151
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:06,529
Alive, he can save us
a lot of dirty work.

152
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:08,126
What watch
shall we take?

153
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,188
The important one.

154
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,599
<i>I'm putting Briggs, Fine
and Corrick on the day watch.</i>

155
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,230
<i>Doesn't figure that Wheeler'll
show up in broad daylight.</i>

156
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:15,466
<i>Well, I guess
that's everything.</i>

157
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,440
Pick yourself up a copy
of this from Harris.

158
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:22,440
Paul...

159
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:27,683
Keep your eye on Paddy.

160
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,151
<i>I'd like to see him
get his pension.</i>

161
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:31,480
<i>And he won't
if he slips again.</i>

162
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,482
Find Briggs and
send him in to me.

163
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,067
Paul, Rick.
Hiya, boys.

164
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:33,406
Been a long afternoon. Anything doing?

165
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:34,809
She went out once.
Briggs tailed her.

166
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,437
She took her car around for a lube job.

167
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:37,503
Might mean
something.

168
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:38,606
<i>She's waiting for
someone all right.</i>

169
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:39,980
<i>Doesn't know what
to do with herself.</i>

170
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,110
Smoked a pack of cigarettes
in the past two hours.

171
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:43,586
Coffee if you want it. Thanks.

172
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:45,589
All the comforts of
home. She get any calls?

173
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:46,919
<i>Nope. Everything's
in the log there.</i>

174
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:48,424
Have fun.
See you.

175
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,552
At 7.00 a.m.
Yeah.

176
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,261
2:46, called in for...

177
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,567
For nothing.

178
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,827
Have you got her? Uh-huh.

179
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,674
What do you think?

180
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,069
<i>You're right.
He'll be around.</i>

181
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:11,373
<i>To me she's still a babe,
like 30 million others.</i>

182
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:37,004
Want me to take
the phone?

183
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,906
<i>No, I'll take it.</i>

184
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:59,185
<i>She's going
to make a call.</i>

185
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,906
<i>The time is 7:10
and 40 seconds.</i>

186
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:15,137
New car, mink coat, and
no clocks in the joint.

187
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:16,874
Probably the story
of her life.

188
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,778
<i>You just don't
like women, Rick.</i>

189
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,442
What keeps
you single?

190
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:21,985
Maybe I like
them too much.

191
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:25,182
<i>We've seen all kinds
since we joined the force.</i>

192
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:28,885
B-girls, hustlers, blackmailers,
shoplifters, drunks.

193
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,622
<i>You know I think I'd still get married,</i>

194
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:32,458
if I could find
a half-honest woman.

195
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:33,926
Must be
a few around.

196
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,193
Watch yourself. Those
few might just be smarter.

197
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:41,338
<i>I don't know what makes a dame like
that tie up with a guy like Wheeler.</i>

198
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:43,400
Money. What else?

199
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:47,178
<i>She's scared. Scared of being
hungry and scared of being alone.</i>

200
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,779
You can wrap up her whole
life in that one word.

201
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:51,144
Money?
Hmm.

202
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:53,275
<i>It's nice, but it doesn't
make the world go round.</i>

203
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:54,477
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

204
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:55,780
<i>Do you know anybody that's happily married</i>

205
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,081
<i>that hasn't got
plenty of it?</i>

206
00:17:57,155 --> 00:18:00,147
My old man was. And he had to
stand the wolf off all his life.

207
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:03,092
Yeah, my folks
hated each other.

208
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:04,458
Fighting all the time.

209
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,125
<i>It's about the only thing
I can remember about them.</i>

210
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,995
One long, endless quarrel.

211
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,432
And always
about money.

212
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,727
Never about
anything but money.

213
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,008
When I was a kid, I promised
myself that when I grew up,

214
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:19,304
<i>I'd have plenty
of dough.</i>

215
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:21,272
Plenty of it.

216
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:23,402
<i>I'm doing all right.</i>

217
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:26,245
<i>I owe the China-man $2.30
on last week's laundry bill.</i>

218
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:28,115
<i>How'd we get
on to this?</i>

219
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:30,916
I think I made a nasty crack about women.

220
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,127
<i>Paul, she's going out.</i>

221
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:13,493
<i>I'll take it.</i>

222
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,841
Change your mind about going out of town?

223
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:39,007
Yeah.

224
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:52,053
I took my car to have it serviced today.

225
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:55,692
Happened to mention the
trouble I had with it,

226
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,894
so the mechanic looked
at the distributor.

227
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:01,362
<i>He said it hasn't
been touched in months.</i>

228
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,842
<i>My car didn't start the other night
because you did something to it.</i>

229
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,003
Why?

230
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:14,308
<i>Can't think of
a fast answer?</i>

231
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,845
Yeah, I can think
of an answer.

232
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:19,083
I saw you walk
into the theater.

233
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:21,191
I liked the way
you walked.

234
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:23,383
As simple as that?

235
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:24,519
Sure, why not?

236
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:26,119
<i>You're a liar.</i>

237
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:28,426
<i>You're also a cop.</i>

238
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:31,162
You need a drink.

239
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:33,467
What do the police
want from me?

240
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:35,663
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

241
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,900
Harry wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

242
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:41,471
Harry?
Wheeler.

243
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,711
<i>He's a friend
of mine.</i>

244
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,874
Harry Wheeler
has no friends.

245
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:48,984
He did me
a favor once.

246
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,020
And you returned it.

247
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:54,886
<i>He didn't do me
that big a favor.</i>

248
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,825
<i>So you're a friend
of Harry's?</i>

249
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,088
<i>That's right.</i>

250
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,623
From St. Louis.

251
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,295
He dreamed up
a pet name for me.

252
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,697
He did that
for a lot of girls.

253
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:06,737
He never called me
anything else.

254
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:09,065
What was it?

255
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:11,636
He was kind of nervous when
I talked to him on the phone.

256
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:14,303
<i>He gave me your name
and address, that's all.</i>

257
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,471
A cop! A dirty,
lying cop!

258
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,607
Wait a minute, baby, take
it easy. Take it easy.

259
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,464
These last few days,

260
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>they weren't all just cop, were they, Paul?</i>

261
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:38,727
No.

262
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:42,570
No, I learned everything I
wanted to know that first night.

263
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,540
I went on seeing you
because I wanted to.

264
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:48,534
<i>But it's over.</i>

265
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:52,742
What happens now?

266
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,717
<i>I'm taking
you downtown.</i>

267
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,250
A man named Eckstrom wants
to ask you some questions.

268
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:01,786
Well,

269
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,951
<i>it's been weird
knowing you.</i>

270
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,798
Not that
it matters, Paul,

271
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:12,164
<i>but I didn't know
that Harry was</i>

272
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:14,136
what he is.

273
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,732
He told me he owned
apartment houses in St. Louis.

274
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,774
He buy you
that coat?

275
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:24,106
Yes.

276
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:32,989
Who was his partner?

277
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:36,118
Partner? Yeah, there
were two on that bank job.

278
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:38,058
We only identified Wheeler.

279
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,222
<i>I told you he didn't have any friends.</i>

280
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:43,193
I met him at a nightclub on
the Strip. He came in alone.

281
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:45,501
<i>He was always alone
if he wasn't with me.</i>

282
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:48,832
And you let him
set up house for you?

283
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,734
All right.

284
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:53,038
He bought me
my clothes and my car

285
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,169
and a lease on a decent place to live in.

286
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:59,311
<i>Things I've never had
in my whole life.</i>

287
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:01,841
<i>If you'd known where his dough came from,</i>

288
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,477
would you still
have taken it?

289
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,214
<i>Money isn't dirty.
Just people.</i>

290
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,991
<i>How's he getting
in touch with you?</i>

291
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:13,423
<i>He'd be crazy to try and you know it. Why?</i>

292
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:15,658
It was just a lucky break
that we got a line on you.

293
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,564
<i>He probably figures
you're clear.</i>

294
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,330
Maybe he will try.

295
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,970
<i>I suppose my
phone's tapped.</i>

296
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,978
<i>What happens to Harry
if he's caught?</i>

297
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:29,672
He killed a man.

298
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:33,314
And the $200,000?

299
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:35,017
What do you think?

300
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,817
<i>I think it's
a lot of money.</i>

301
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:41,950
<i>And right now
Harry's got it.</i>

302
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,526
<i>That's right.</i>

303
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,122
Paul...

304
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:48,764
Go on home.

305
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:50,832
<i>Why?
I wouldn't know.</i>

306
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,165
Go on before I start thinking about it.

307
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,880
<i>I don't want
to go, Paul.</i>

308
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:08,513
Not yet.

309
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:22,462
We could have that money, Paul, you and I.

310
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:25,700
<i>Look, Harry's going to
die no matter what we do.</i>

311
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,739
<i>So what difference will it make
if he shows up and he's killed?</i>

312
00:25:29,674 --> 00:25:31,869
<i>Be a perfect set-up
for a cop, wouldn't it?</i>

313
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,502
I could knock him off, hide the
money and call the meat wagon.

314
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,343
No questions asked.

315
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:40,847
Think what that money
could mean to us, Paul.

316
00:25:41,385 --> 00:25:42,613
To you and me.

317
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,282
And I thought
I was using you.

318
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,887
Get out.

319
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:51,623
Get out!

320
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:41,129
<i>Where'd she go?</i>

321
00:27:41,205 --> 00:27:43,196
Just drove around,
going no place.

322
00:27:43,674 --> 00:27:45,801
Might have been trying to
make a contact or something.

323
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,278
She looks a little
frustrated at that.

324
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:51,141
Should one of us go down and relieve Paddy?

325
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:54,041
Hey, you with me?
What?

326
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:55,915
I thought one of us ought
to go down and relieve Paddy.

327
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:57,351
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I'll do it.</i>

328
00:27:58,556 --> 00:27:59,853
<i>What's she doing?</i>

329
00:27:59,924 --> 00:28:03,087
<i>Hanging drapes. Oh,
you mean Wheeler's dame.</i>

330
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,355
<i>She's sitting over there
staring at the wall.</i>

331
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:08,097
<i>There's a little nurse
next door. Always busy.</i>

332
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,230
<i>Hasn't stopped
moving for a minute.</i>

333
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:49,261
<i>Hello. What's holding you up?</i>

334
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,024
Where are you?

335
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:53,126
At the bowling alley.
Where else?

336
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:54,966
<i>Don't tell me you
forgot about it?</i>

337
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,870
<i>I'm sorry, Rick,
I did forget about it.</i>

338
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:59,466
I woke up this morning with a fat headache.

339
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:00,976
<i>I think I'd better
skip it today, huh?</i>

340
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:02,336
Sure.

341
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,404
<i>Brew yourself some thick black
coffee. I'll see you tonight.</i>

342
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:06,140
Right.

343
00:30:15,626 --> 00:30:17,355
<i>Why don't
you sit down?</i>

344
00:30:17,428 --> 00:30:18,793
Give your feet a rest.

345
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:20,056
<i>I'm all right.</i>

346
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:21,825
Are you?

347
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:24,632
What do you
mean by that?

348
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:27,102
<i>You've been looking kind of
bad the last couple of nights.</i>

349
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:28,468
Trouble sleeping
daytimes?

350
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:32,002
Yeah, yeah, the... So many
kids in the neighborhood.

351
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:36,379
<i>The minute I get home, take a big
double shot, and wham, I'm asleep.</i>

352
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,247
<i>I'll have to
try that.</i>

353
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,278
<i>Why don't you go down and relieve Rick?</i>

354
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,184
Right.

355
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:38,966
<i>But why can't
I go up to the...</i>

356
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:42,035
<i>Please. Thanks a lot for the ride
home, but I've got to get upstairs.</i>

357
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:43,909
<i>But what's your hurry? It's early yet.</i>

358
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:46,074
<i>I'm awfully tired.
Uh, thanks anyway.</i>

359
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,139
Now wait a minute.

360
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:48,616
<i>Look, why don't you go up
and get out of that uniform,</i>

361
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:49,982
<i>and we'll go out and
have a drink some place.</i>

362
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:51,817
Some other time. Good night. No.

363
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:53,516
Now just a minute.
Give me back my purse.

364
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,182
<i>I'll give it to you
when you come down. Okay?</i>

365
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,658
<i>Now you're being very
childish. Give it back.</i>

366
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:57,819
<i>No, you're not going to get it. Hey.</i>

367
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:59,294
No, I said.

368
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:01,955
<i>Forget it. It's not worth
it. Now wait a minute.</i>

369
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:03,431
<i>You're going to come down...
The lady said good night.</i>

370
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,899
<i>I guess you
didn't hear.</i>

371
00:32:07,104 --> 00:32:08,731
<i>Why don't you mind your
own business, buddy?</i>

372
00:32:08,806 --> 00:32:11,400
Now give the lady back
her purse and take a walk.

373
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:14,203
<i>Look, chum, I don't
think it's any of your...</i>

374
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:17,607
Be a nice fellow and
catch yourself some air.

375
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:26,149
Thank you.
Very much.

376
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,588
It was a pleasure.

377
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,321
<i>You did that like... As if
you'd done it before a few times.</i>

378
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:36,230
I was a bouncer once,
a long time ago.

379
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,265
<i>Maybe I should
learn how it's done.</i>

380
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:40,064
It might
come in handy.

381
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:42,503
<i>Wouldn't it be simpler
just to avoid that type?</i>

382
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:14,168
I really am grateful for what you did.

383
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:16,598
Never know for sure.
Some women like that kind.

384
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,300
<i>Oh, well I don't.</i>

385
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:21,000
<i>Not that it matters, but I
didn't have a date with him.</i>

386
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:23,945
<i>I'm a nurse, and he goes with a
friend of mine at the hospital.</i>

387
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:27,074
He offered me a lift home, and
I made a mistake and accepted it.

388
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:29,210
<i>You don't have to
explain it to me.</i>

389
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:30,886
<i>Oh, no, it's
just that I...</i>

390
00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:34,290
<i>I guess I didn't want you
to have a bad opinion of me.</i>

391
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:35,586
<i>Don't ask me why.</i>

392
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:36,990
<i>All right, I won't.</i>

393
00:33:38,262 --> 00:33:40,059
<i>Shouldn't I offer you a cup
of coffee or something?</i>

394
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,791
It seems the least
I could do.

395
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:43,696
After you learn
that hammer lock.

396
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:45,291
<i>I won't need it. My
roommate hasn't left yet.</i>

397
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:47,064
<i>She's a nurse, too.
Night shift.</i>

398
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:48,936
Maybe some
other time.

399
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:52,434
Oh. All right.
Well, good night.

400
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:54,101
Good night.

401
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:36,748
This is Paul. I may have to hang up fast.

402
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,611
Take the stairs and go up on
the roof. I want to talk to you.

403
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,291
<i>Right now. Don't even
bother to finish that drink.</i>

404
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:48,660
Sorry for the delay. I got tied up.

405
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,598
<i>It's all right. The girl's
going out. I'll take her.</i>

406
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:42,478
Over here, Paul.

407
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:56,727
You win.

408
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:04,764
<i>Couldn't have
taken much more,</i>

409
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:06,206
wondering what
was happening,

410
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:09,439
waiting for the phone to
ring and scared it might.

411
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,846
Thinking of you, wanting to
see you, wanting you to call me.

412
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:15,245
I know.

413
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:20,245
<i>This isn't going
to be easy.</i>

414
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:22,884
<i>We've got to keep our heads every second.</i>

415
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:29,724
<i>Your phone's tapped and there are
three men watching you day and night.</i>

416
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,893
<i>Harry's coming here.
Maybe tomorrow.</i>

417
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:33,936
Tomorrow?
That soon?

418
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:35,130
<i>You've got
to stop him.</i>

419
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:36,433
<i>How? I don't know
where he is.</i>

420
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:37,871
<i>Well, he'll call
first, won't he?</i>

421
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:39,203
Yes, but he... Well then, stall him.

422
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:40,937
<i>And don't answer your
phone unless I'm on the tap.</i>

423
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,535
Paul, will you
listen to me?

424
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,772
<i>It doesn't matter
if anyone hears.</i>

425
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:45,940
Harry told me exactly
what to say when he calls.

426
00:36:46,516 --> 00:36:47,710
<i>And if I say anything else, he won't...</i>

427
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,650
What did he tell
you to say?

428
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,424
<i>When he calls, he'll ask me
what TV program I'm looking at.</i>

429
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:03,027
<i>If everything is clear, I'll
say I'm not looking at TV.</i>

430
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,533
<i>You're not
looking at TV.</i>

431
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:06,334
<i>Yes, and that's it.</i>

432
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:08,337
<i>He'll show up here
10 or 15 minutes later.</i>

433
00:37:08,472 --> 00:37:11,100
<i>Here? Do you think he'll
have the money with him?</i>

434
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:12,163
Yes.

435
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:13,903
<i>Can't you tell him to
meet you someplace else?</i>

436
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:16,707
<i>No! If I say anything but what he
told me to say, it's a signal to run.</i>

437
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,047
<i>He'll show up right
after he calls?</i>

438
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:20,981
10 or 15
minutes later.

439
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:22,440
All right.

440
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,787
All right.
Now remember,

441
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:28,089
<i>you're not to answer your
phone until after 7:00</i>

442
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,420
<i>when I'm on the tap.</i>

443
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,925
When Wheeler calls, you
give him the all-clear.

444
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:33,690
Then you leave, fast.

445
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,288
<i>One man will tail you and I'll
change places with the man outside.</i>

446
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:38,698
Have you got an extra
key to your apartment?

447
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:40,100
No, but maybe...
Never mind.

448
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,229
When you go, leave the
door open so I can get in.

449
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:43,294
How long
do I stay away?

450
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,739
<i>You don't come back
until you call me first.</i>

451
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:48,539
<i>If it's all over, I'll
be there to take the call.</i>

452
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:51,339
<i>If you don't get
an answer, stay away.</i>

453
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:52,946
Have you got it
all straight?

454
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:54,244
Yes.
You sure?

455
00:37:54,317 --> 00:37:55,477
Uh-huh.
All right.

456
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:56,644
Now go down
in your car

457
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,449
and drive around for a
while and then come back.

458
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:00,490
<i>I'll be right
behind you.</i>

459
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,155
<i>Couldn't I drive
to your place?</i>

460
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:06,053
No.

461
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:09,555
<i>No, we can't take any
more chances. Now, go on.</i>

462
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:16,834
Be careful, Paul.

463
00:38:25,715 --> 00:38:27,649
Man!

464
00:38:28,618 --> 00:38:30,017
The redhead
on the third floor?

465
00:38:30,086 --> 00:38:32,714
<i>Isn't that the most...</i>

466
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:35,349
Well, you only get out of a sweater
what you put into it, I always say.

467
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:36,915
Yeah. You said it
twice this morning.

468
00:38:36,993 --> 00:38:38,893
Let me have a look.

469
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:54,368
Answer your
phone, Blondie.

470
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,284
<i>What's going on?</i>

471
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:05,821
Still in the bedroom.

472
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:09,016
<i>She's not going
to answer it.</i>

473
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:13,588
<i>That's funny.</i>

474
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,497
You just missed
something.

475
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:22,571
What happened?
Her phone rang,

476
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,731
half a dozen times.

477
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:25,274
She just
ignored it.

478
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:26,331
<i>How'd she react?</i>

479
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:28,377
<i>Couldn't tell. She was in the bedroom.</i>

480
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:31,036
Maybe she knows
her phone is tapped.

481
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:33,344
<i>You're sure she wasn't in
the shower or something?</i>

482
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,111
Just stood in the bedroom
and stared at the phone.

483
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:37,210
Almost hate
to leave.

484
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:38,686
This may be
the big night.

485
00:39:38,755 --> 00:39:41,246
Yeah. I can hardly tear myself away.

486
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:42,857
Well, enjoy
the view.

487
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:45,258
<i>We'll see you.
Good night.</i>

488
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,421
If that call was supposed
to mean something,

489
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:51,296
<i>she isn't
showing it.</i>

490
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:02,264
<i>Probably
her roommate's party.</i>

491
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,239
Must be her night off
or something.

492
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:06,168
<i>How do you know
it isn't her party?</i>

493
00:41:06,242 --> 00:41:07,641
<i>She's tired.</i>

494
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:10,680
I saw her come home
tonight, and she was beat.

495
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,613
<i>You'd never know it
to look at her now.</i>

496
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:22,889
Well, this thing will
probably go on all night.

497
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:24,485
What do you care?

498
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:25,550
<i>I don't.</i>

499
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:33,162
Maybe I do. I find myself watching
her like I was her father or something.

500
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:35,970
I wait for her
to come home.

501
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,563
<i>When she's late,
I worry about her,</i>

502
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:39,541
<i>wonder what
she's doing.</i>

503
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:43,770
<i>And, uh, who she's doing
it with. Is that the idea?</i>

504
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,978
Yeah, something like that.

505
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:49,145
At least I feel I know
her well enough to...

506
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:54,520
<i>She's going
to answer it.</i>

507
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:00,288
<i>Hello.</i>

508
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,694
<i>Good evening. This is
the RTV Rating Service.</i>

509
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:05,098
<i>Would you tell me what program
you're watching right now?</i>

510
00:42:05,168 --> 00:42:06,931
<i>TVprogram, that is.</i>

511
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:08,761
<i>I'm not watching TV.</i>

512
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:10,940
<i>I see. Thank you.</i>

513
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:17,708
Did you ever hear
of an RTV Rating Service?

514
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:18,907
No.

515
00:42:18,982 --> 00:42:20,506
<i>See what she's doing.</i>

516
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,248
<i>She's gone
into the bedroom.</i>

517
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:29,856
<i>She's going out, Paul.
This may be it.</i>

518
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:32,194
Like me to take her
this time?

519
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:34,287
<i>I'd give my right arm to nail
that babe and her boyfriend.</i>

520
00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:36,855
Okay, Rick. Go ahead. Good luck.

521
00:43:17,407 --> 00:43:19,841
<i>Operator.
Mobile operator.</i>

522
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:21,672
<i>One moment, please.</i>

523
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:24,112
<i>Mobile operator.</i>

524
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,614
Give me
WJ 8-2-3-1-1.

525
00:43:27,016 --> 00:43:28,040
<i>Your name and number?</i>

526
00:43:28,118 --> 00:43:30,814
Sheridan.
Hollywood 9-5-2-6-4.

527
00:43:30,954 --> 00:43:31,978
Hurry it up, please.

528
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:33,147
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

529
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,531
<i>There's no answer, sir.</i>

530
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:45,829
No answer?

531
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:48,063
<i>There's got to be an answer. Try it again.</i>

532
00:43:48,438 --> 00:43:51,339
<i>Yes, sir.
WJ 8-2-3-1-1.</i>

533
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,215
<i>What's up, Paul? Your
job, that's what's up.</i>

534
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:41,018
<i>The effects from... I'm sorry,
Paul, but all I did was...</i>

535
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,887
<i>I know. We'll talk
about it later.</i>

536
00:44:42,959 --> 00:44:44,324
<i>I'll take over in the car. You go upstairs.</i>

537
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:46,328
Sure, Paul, but I...

538
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,497
What is it?
Wheeler.

539
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:04,739
<i>He's gone in. We've got to call Rick.</i>

540
00:45:04,814 --> 00:45:06,076
<i>No! No, Rick's
not up there.</i>

541
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:07,377
<i>The girl went out.
He's tailing her.</i>

542
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,145
<i>Then what'll we do?</i>

543
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:11,412
Well?

544
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:12,612
<i>When he finds out
she's not up there,</i>

545
00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:14,680
he may get scared
and run.

546
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,655
<i>If he doesn't, we'll go up
and take him there. Come on.</i>

547
00:45:31,975 --> 00:45:35,240
<i>Eckstrom don't need to know
about what happened, does he?</i>

548
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:37,002
What?
Eckstrom.

549
00:45:37,947 --> 00:45:39,710
Does he have to
know about...

550
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,108
If nothing
goes wrong, no.

551
00:46:02,705 --> 00:46:05,299
<i>I don't want to lose
my pension, Paul.</i>

552
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:07,531
But I

553
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:11,673
<i>guess you'll do
what you got to do.</i>

554
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:13,841
<i>I'll give you
every break I can.</i>

555
00:46:14,217 --> 00:46:16,412
<i>If you'd been on the job, I'd
have taken him at the elevator,</i>

556
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:18,511
the way Eckstrom
wanted it.

557
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:21,556
You better hope
nothing goes wrong.

558
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:42,241
Hold it, Wheeler!
I got him!

559
00:46:44,314 --> 00:46:45,804
<i>Now, let's go.</i>

560
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,107
Where?
Downtown.

561
00:46:49,185 --> 00:46:51,153
<i>But first we'll pick up the money, huh?</i>

562
00:46:51,788 --> 00:46:53,653
You got it
in your car?

563
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:56,624
<i>Let's go
find out, huh?</i>

564
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:47,673
This it?
Yeah.

565
00:47:47,744 --> 00:47:49,439
Locked?
Yeah.

566
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:51,275
<i>Let's have
the keys.</i>

567
00:48:05,762 --> 00:48:07,593
Looks like
the whole bundle.

568
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:10,223
<i>What'd you do with your
partner, Wheeler? Kill him?</i>

569
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,398
Okay, Paddy,
close the satchel.

570
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:24,206
What happened? He jumped you. What else?

571
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,645
<i>Why'd you shoot him?
I could have handled him.</i>

572
00:48:25,715 --> 00:48:28,650
<i>Why, you're half-drunk. For
all I knew he had your gun.</i>

573
00:48:29,585 --> 00:48:31,177
<i>Well, what now?
I don't know.</i>

574
00:48:31,754 --> 00:48:34,382
Eckstrom will crucify us.
He wanted him alive.

575
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:36,015
<i>There'll only
be one goat.</i>

576
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:37,184
Me.

577
00:48:37,427 --> 00:48:38,416
No.

578
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:41,523
<i>No, there's a way out.
Give me a hand, Paddy.</i>

579
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:44,293
<i>What're you doing?
I'm saving your skin.</i>

580
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:50,666
<i>Tomorrow, I'll drive the
car someplace and leave it.</i>

581
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,799
<i>They'll find it and we'll be in the clear.</i>

582
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,139
All we have to do is keep our mouths shut.

583
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:57,073
<i>What's the gimmick?</i>

584
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,214
Gimmick? You doing all this for me?

585
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,978
Why not?

586
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:03,615
<i>I don't know.</i>

587
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,748
<i>But I'd rather lose
my pension than...</i>

588
00:49:08,257 --> 00:49:11,590
When they find Wheeler, will
they find that money, too?

589
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:14,089
What kind
of a crack is that?

590
00:49:14,464 --> 00:49:15,795
<i>Maybe I'd better call Eckstrom right now?</i>

591
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,127
I gotta know, Paul.

592
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,394
I gotta know the money will be there.

593
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:20,231
Sure, it will be there!

594
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:22,370
Then give me
the keys.

595
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:25,266
<i>We'll both drive the car away tomorrow.</i>

596
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:27,941
Okay, Paddy.

597
00:49:28,744 --> 00:49:30,268
You keep them.

598
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:33,205
<i>We'd better get back.</i>

599
00:50:15,424 --> 00:50:16,755
<i>What'll it be?</i>

600
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:17,815
Same as hers.

601
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:26,121
Hello.

602
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,142
<i>I'm afraid I gave you
the wrong impression.</i>

603
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,244
I doubt it.

604
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:55,518
No really, you remind me of someone.

605
00:51:55,891 --> 00:51:58,189
<i>Haven't you
ever met me before?</i>

606
00:51:58,261 --> 00:52:00,126
Hundreds of times.

607
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,327
<i>I don't get it.</i>

608
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:04,798
<i>And you won't,
so try someplace else.</i>

609
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:06,391
<i>No. You've got
the wrong idea.</i>

610
00:52:06,469 --> 00:52:09,063
<i>I'm not just fresh, I'm sure
that I've met you someplace.</i>

611
00:52:09,872 --> 00:52:11,100
What...

612
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:14,032
Uh, will there be
anything else, sir?

613
00:52:31,694 --> 00:52:33,457
<i>Hello.
It's me, Paul.</i>

614
00:52:33,896 --> 00:52:35,363
<i>It's done.</i>

615
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:36,898
Is everything all right?

616
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:38,866
<i>There's a complication,
but I can handle it.</i>

617
00:52:38,934 --> 00:52:40,367
Get back here.

618
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:42,495
<i>What happened? I'll talk to you later.</i>

619
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,570
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

620
00:52:48,644 --> 00:52:50,771
<i>We're having a little party next
door and ran out of ice cubes.</i>

621
00:52:50,846 --> 00:52:53,246
<i>Could I borrow some? I'm
sorry. I can't help you.</i>

622
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:42,388
<i>How'd it go, Rick?</i>

623
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:45,366
Another dry run.
I think she spotted me.

624
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:46,560
Why?

625
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:49,467
She made a call from the Twilight
Room and came right back here.

626
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:51,506
<i>It means she spotted me or
knows her phone's tapped.</i>

627
00:53:51,574 --> 00:53:52,700
Or both.

628
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:54,402
Or neither.
Maybe.

629
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:57,743
<i>Hey, you're up
kind of late, Lieutenant.</i>

630
00:53:57,813 --> 00:53:59,007
Something break?

631
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:00,070
<i>Our man's in town.</i>

632
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:04,547
Spotted in a drug store on the
east side earlier this evening.

633
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,385
<i>I'd hoped you might
have him here for me.</i>

634
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:07,945
<i>Well, we'd hoped
the same thing.</i>

635
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:09,615
<i>I'm afraid
I haven't.</i>

636
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:10,818
Why not?

637
00:54:10,893 --> 00:54:12,656
<i>The dame acts like she
knows her phone's tapped.</i>

638
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:14,286
Made a call
from a bar tonight.

639
00:54:14,363 --> 00:54:16,263
Probably touted
him off.

640
00:54:16,832 --> 00:54:18,163
<i>Then you've
been here alone.</i>

641
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:20,168
For the last
hour, yeah.

642
00:54:20,236 --> 00:54:21,567
All quiet?

643
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:23,901
<i>Her phone rang once. That's all.</i>

644
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,971
Check the neighborhood,
Sheridan.

645
00:54:28,043 --> 00:54:30,068
Parked cars, alleys.

646
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:31,306
<i>I'll wait here
a while.</i>

647
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:32,707
Right.

648
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,826
What time did you leave
tonight, Rick, to tail her?

649
00:54:46,896 --> 00:54:48,158
About 10:30.

650
00:54:49,398 --> 00:54:50,695
What time did you
get back?

651
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,699
A minute ago. Why?

652
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:57,237
I phoned here a half dozen
times between 10:50 and 11:15.

653
00:54:57,373 --> 00:54:58,704
No answer.

654
00:54:58,774 --> 00:55:01,368
Some thing from the car parked outside.

655
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:05,603
<i>I gave him a chance to
explain. Why didn't he?</i>

656
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:08,739
Talk to Paddy?

657
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:11,948
He had nothing
to offer either.

658
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:13,852
<i>But he's scared
to death.</i>

659
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:17,849
<i>You and Sheridan are
fairly close, aren't you?</i>

660
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,459
<i>That's right.</i>

661
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:21,587
<i>But I'm not trying
to cover for him.</i>

662
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:24,461
<i>Maybe Paul's trying to
do it for Dolan.</i>

663
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:25,795
Why?

664
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,028
Why not ask Dolan?

665
00:55:27,203 --> 00:55:29,728
<i>I'm asking you.
And I want an answer.</i>

666
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:33,534
When I followed her I
drove past the lookout car.

667
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:34,769
<i>Paddy wasn't in it.</i>

668
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,705
When I got to
the intersection,

669
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,414
I saw him go
into a bar.

670
00:55:40,649 --> 00:55:43,243
I guess that bar was
just a little too close.

671
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:55,754
Paul, we... Shut up
and get back in the car.

672
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:05,533
Eckstrom talk to you?

673
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:07,974
<i>He knows something's
up. What'd you tell him?</i>

674
00:56:08,043 --> 00:56:09,408
<i>Nothing I didn't
have to. He knew.</i>

675
00:56:09,478 --> 00:56:11,708
<i>He doesn't know anything.
He just thinks he does.</i>

676
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,510
He gave me a phony job
to get me out of the room.

677
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:16,382
<i>Give me the keys
to Wheeler's car.</i>

678
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:19,250
<i>I'll get it out of here while
we've still got a chance.</i>

679
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:20,879
Come on!
Give me the keys!

680
00:56:20,956 --> 00:56:23,447
<i>We're only making things worse, Paul.</i>

681
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:25,660
<i>I'm goin' up and tell Eckstrom
just the way it happened.</i>

682
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:27,320
<i>You're not going
to tell him anything.</i>

683
00:56:27,396 --> 00:56:29,193
<i>I'm in this, too,
remember?</i>

684
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:30,490
Why?

685
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,858
<i>You were just
coverin' for me.</i>

686
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,766
<i>Isn't that right? And
Eckstrom'll throw the book at me.</i>

687
00:56:34,837 --> 00:56:35,826
<i>Who do you think
you're kiddin'?</i>

688
00:56:35,905 --> 00:56:38,066
<i>You'll come out
sweet as a rose.</i>

689
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,538
A hero for trying
to protect a buddy.

690
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:43,169
<i>Look, Paddy, Eckstrom
can't prove a thing.</i>

691
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:45,274
Why throw away
your pension?

692
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:48,783
Because I spent 25 years
being a dumb, honest cop.

693
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,276
<i>And I'm stuck with it. Wait a minute.</i>

694
00:56:56,759 --> 00:56:58,226
<i>What's the idea?</i>

695
00:56:58,294 --> 00:57:00,228
<i>You didn't do
anything for me.</i>

696
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:02,592
<i>You're after
that dough.</i>

697
00:57:02,665 --> 00:57:05,065
<i>That's why you came down looking for me.</i>

698
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:07,565
You knew Wheeler
was going to show.

699
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:09,227
Now wait a minute, Paddy.

700
00:57:09,305 --> 00:57:11,432
<i>Nope. We're both going up
and tell it just like it...</i>

701
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,844
<i>Doesn't answer.
Come on.</i>

702
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:32,117
<i>Tell 'em to get here as fast
as they can, but no sirens.</i>

703
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:34,246
And keep this
from the press boys!

704
00:58:42,498 --> 00:58:44,022
I heard a shot!

705
00:58:46,201 --> 00:58:47,395
Paddy?

706
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:52,499
Dead?

707
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:55,569
Rick, get those people
back to bed.

708
00:58:55,878 --> 00:58:58,278
<i>We don't want a crowd
around here.</i>

709
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,740
All right, folks,
back on the sidewalk.

710
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:01,214
<i>What's going on, officer?
We heard the shot.</i>

711
00:59:01,283 --> 00:59:03,717
Just a slight accident.
Back on the sidewalk, please.

712
00:59:03,786 --> 00:59:06,050
<i>What do you think?
I don't know.</i>

713
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:08,055
Powder burns,
his own gun.

714
00:59:08,123 --> 00:59:09,590
Why would he
kill himself?

715
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:11,319
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

716
00:59:11,393 --> 00:59:12,985
<i>Then you think
he didn't?</i>

717
00:59:21,704 --> 00:59:24,229
Where were you tonight
around 11:00?

718
00:59:24,807 --> 00:59:25,796
I was upstairs. Why?

719
00:59:25,874 --> 00:59:27,239
<i>No, you weren't.</i>

720
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:29,504
We know where Dolan was. Where were you?

721
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,239
You know
where Dolan was?

722
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:33,042
McAllister saw him.

723
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:35,941
<i>I told him
I'd cover for him.</i>

724
00:59:36,218 --> 00:59:38,652
<i>I tried to get him on the car
phone about 10:30, he didn't answer.</i>

725
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:39,745
I know.

726
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:41,722
The operator gave me
the message just now.

727
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:44,450
I came down to see what
had happened to him.

728
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,460
<i>Found he'd gone over to the bar.</i>

729
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:49,053
He was scared. He kept
talking about his pension.

730
00:59:49,865 --> 00:59:51,196
I brought him back here.

731
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:54,167
<i>I tried to make him understand
I wouldn't say anything,</i>

732
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:57,036
<i>but I guess
he wasn't listening.</i>

733
00:59:59,374 --> 01:00:00,432
<i>Well, you'd better
get back upstairs.</i>

734
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:01,942
<i>We've still got
a job to do here.</i>

735
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,102
Yeah.

736
01:00:09,718 --> 01:00:12,687
<i>There's not much point keeping
a stakeout now, is there?</i>

737
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:14,880
You got any
better ideas?

738
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,137
Yeah, right away.

739
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,565
<i>Oh, look, there's
been an accident.</i>

740
01:00:59,635 --> 01:01:00,659
Wonder what happened?

741
01:01:00,736 --> 01:01:02,033
Wanna go over?
Maybe you can help.

742
01:01:02,104 --> 01:01:03,093
<i>No, they don't
need us.</i>

743
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:04,298
<i>They'd be the first to say so.</i>

744
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:05,772
<i>Oh, it's so late.</i>

745
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:07,103
Come on.

746
01:01:07,643 --> 01:01:09,474
<i>Are you sure you won't change
your mind and come with us, Ann?</i>

747
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:10,637
No, you all go on.

748
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:11,701
All right.
And have fun.

749
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,270
<i>You know the Crockett's
number if you need me.</i>

750
01:01:13,348 --> 01:01:14,508
<i>Oh, don't worry.</i>

751
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:15,982
Give us a call. All right. Bye.

752
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:18,315
Nighty night.
Bye.

753
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,141
<i>He's dead.
I shot him.</i>

754
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:48,240
What do you mean?
Paddy Dolan.

755
01:01:48,317 --> 01:01:49,477
What happened?
I killed him.

756
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:51,041
The poor, dumb, harmless...

757
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,245
He pulled a gun on me.

758
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:54,118
It went off. It was
an accident. I...

759
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:06,825
Are they after you?
No.

760
01:02:06,902 --> 01:02:08,199
<i>But everything's
gone wrong.</i>

761
01:02:08,337 --> 01:02:09,429
Paddy and...

762
01:02:09,504 --> 01:02:10,562
And that
girl downstairs,

763
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,470
she saw me in your apartment. What girl?

764
01:02:12,574 --> 01:02:14,565
The one that lives
next to you. The nurse.

765
01:02:14,643 --> 01:02:16,440
<i>Does she know who you
are? I don't think so.</i>

766
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:18,103
<i>But she'll remember me.
She'll remember me good.</i>

767
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,738
<i>Paul, look, we've got the
money. Why don't we get out now?</i>

768
01:02:19,815 --> 01:02:22,113
<i>We haven't got the money! The car's gone.</i>

769
01:02:22,184 --> 01:02:24,152
How? Paddy must have moved it.

770
01:02:25,053 --> 01:02:26,111
<i>He couldn't have
moved it far.</i>

771
01:02:26,188 --> 01:02:27,655
It must be around here
someplace close.

772
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:30,716
Maybe we could
spot it from up here.

773
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:34,489
<i>McAllister's
still down there.</i>

774
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,863
<i>You take that side.
I'll look over here.</i>

775
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:13,664
Go on upstairs, Rick.

776
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,770
<i>Who tells
Paddy's wife?</i>

777
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:19,437
That goes with my job.

778
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:22,533
What are you going to
say? He killed himself?

779
01:03:23,111 --> 01:03:24,874
What else can I say?

780
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:29,913
Get those people
out of there.

781
01:03:40,996 --> 01:03:42,691
Anything serious?

782
01:03:43,598 --> 01:03:44,656
No.

783
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,637
<i>You know, you're a bitter
disappointment to me.</i>

784
01:03:57,713 --> 01:03:58,805
Oh?

785
01:03:58,914 --> 01:04:00,472
The other night.

786
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:02,540
You were just
doing your job.

787
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:05,846
<i>You are a policeman,
aren't you?</i>

788
01:04:13,962 --> 01:04:15,088
Paul!

789
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:20,058
<i>That's it.</i>

790
01:04:20,135 --> 01:04:22,501
Go down to your apartment, stay
there a few minutes, and then leave.

791
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:24,596
I want the man that follows
you kept out at least an hour.

792
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:25,662
What are you going to do?

793
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,641
<i>I'm going to put Wheeler's body
where it'll be found tonight.</i>

794
01:04:27,709 --> 01:04:29,199
Why? Why take
any chance now?

795
01:04:29,277 --> 01:04:31,040
<i>Tomorrow we... I can't do
it in the broad daylight.</i>

796
01:04:31,113 --> 01:04:33,172
<i>And if that girl sees
me again, I'm through.</i>

797
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:36,945
<i>When they find the body, the stakeout
will be over and I'll be away from here.</i>

798
01:04:38,153 --> 01:04:41,145
<i>Everything's going to
be all right? Sure. Sure.</i>

799
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:48,057
You have a wonderful way
of sidestepping questions.

800
01:04:48,597 --> 01:04:50,462
Shall I just stop
asking them?

801
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,123
Right now, yes.

802
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:54,692
But save them
for next week.

803
01:04:55,337 --> 01:04:56,702
Next week?

804
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,304
<i>You wouldn't be
asking for a date?</i>

805
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:01,508
<i>I can't even answer
that for sure.</i>

806
01:05:01,576 --> 01:05:03,544
Is your name
in the book?

807
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:05,403
<i>Ann Stewart,
with a "W."</i>

808
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,606
<i>But you'd better call me at the hospital.</i>

809
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:08,376
After our party tonight,
we may be evicted.

810
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,508
Was it that bad?

811
01:05:09,584 --> 01:05:12,018
<i>I didn't think so, but the
people next door apparently did.</i>

812
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,246
People next door.

813
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:15,084
<i>You don't mean 423?</i>

814
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:17,550
Yes. Why not?
What happened?

815
01:05:18,326 --> 01:05:20,886
Well, nothing, really. I went over
to borrow some ice cubes from him.

816
01:05:20,962 --> 01:05:23,157
<i>Him? You mean
her, don't you?</i>

817
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:25,192
No, I mean him.

818
01:05:37,512 --> 01:05:39,139
What time was it?

819
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:41,545
Well, about 11:00.

820
01:05:42,117 --> 01:05:43,709
Is he important?

821
01:05:43,785 --> 01:05:46,652
He may have killed a man
last week and another tonight.

822
01:05:51,893 --> 01:05:55,454
Do you think you could recognize
him if you saw him again?

823
01:05:55,697 --> 01:05:57,995
Yes. I think I could.

824
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,868
<i>Then you'll be hearing from
me sooner than I thought.</i>

825
01:06:00,936 --> 01:06:02,267
Good night.

826
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:16,006
Wheeler was here.
In her apartment.

827
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:19,009
When? When you were out looking for Paddy.

828
01:06:19,321 --> 01:06:20,379
<i>How'd you find out
about it?</i>

829
01:06:20,455 --> 01:06:22,480
The nurse. She tried to
borrow some ice cubes.

830
01:06:22,557 --> 01:06:24,650
He gave her
a fast brush-off.

831
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:26,124
223 please.

832
01:06:27,162 --> 01:06:28,322
Mitchell?

833
01:06:28,396 --> 01:06:30,159
When Eckstrom gets in,
have him call me.

834
01:06:30,565 --> 01:06:32,430
McAllister. Right.

835
01:06:33,735 --> 01:06:34,895
Could she
identify him?

836
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,938
Well, who else
could it be?

837
01:06:37,005 --> 01:06:38,666
<i>What's the
blonde doing?</i>

838
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,173
The usual things.

839
01:06:40,242 --> 01:06:42,938
<i>If there's anybody in there
with her, she doesn't know it.</i>

840
01:06:43,612 --> 01:06:45,705
Do you think the nurse
scared him off?

841
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:48,608
<i>I don't know.</i>

842
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:50,546
She said he opened the
door before she knocked,

843
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,109
as if he was leaving.

844
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:54,252
<i>Well, then when he found
out his girl wasn't up there,</i>

845
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:55,346
<i>he probably got nervous
and... That's just it.</i>

846
01:06:55,423 --> 01:06:56,981
<i>Why wasn't she?</i>

847
01:06:57,259 --> 01:07:00,126
<i>I can't spot it, but
something's wrong somewhere.</i>

848
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,463
<i>And what happened to Paddy,
that doesn't fit either.</i>

849
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:07,001
Eckstrom must have scared
him out of his mind.

850
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:09,600
Do you really think
Paddy killed himself?

851
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:12,765
If you were going to check out,
would you put a.38 slug in your belly?

852
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:14,433
Nobody kills
himself like that.

853
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:15,976
Least of all a cop.

854
01:07:16,044 --> 01:07:17,909
I know Paddy like
I know my own self.

855
01:07:17,979 --> 01:07:20,413
<i>He wouldn't have done it. Not
that way, or any other way.</i>

856
01:07:20,482 --> 01:07:23,110
<i>And he certainly wouldn't have
let Wheeler get that close.</i>

857
01:07:23,185 --> 01:07:24,516
Maybe he did.

858
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:25,610
No.

859
01:07:28,023 --> 01:07:30,150
You know
what I think, Paul.

860
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:34,059
I think whoever killed Paddy was
right there in the car with him.

861
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:35,562
Sitting right there
beside him.

862
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,161
Hello.

863
01:07:40,835 --> 01:07:42,860
All right,
give him a message.

864
01:07:42,971 --> 01:07:45,769
Wheeler paid us a visit
about 11:00 tonight.

865
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,831
The lady in
apartment 426.

866
01:07:48,009 --> 01:07:49,909
Yeah, she went over
to borrow some ice cubes.

867
01:10:28,837 --> 01:10:30,168
She there?

868
01:10:30,338 --> 01:10:32,670
<i>She just came in.
Where'd she go?</i>

869
01:10:33,174 --> 01:10:35,540
Nowhere. Anything
happen over there?

870
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,339
<i>No, it's all quiet.</i>

871
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,808
Know where she went?

872
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,371
To the beach.

873
01:10:42,384 --> 01:10:44,477
Looked at the water
exactly three minutes,

874
01:10:44,552 --> 01:10:46,349
came right back here.

875
01:10:47,055 --> 01:10:48,181
Why?

876
01:10:48,256 --> 01:10:49,245
<i>It doesn't
make sense.</i>

877
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:50,985
<i>Well, she probably figured
there's only one man</i>

878
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:52,424
watching her place,
wanted to draw him off.

879
01:10:52,494 --> 01:10:53,688
Why? Nothing
happened over there,

880
01:10:53,762 --> 01:10:56,094
<i>and Schaeffer didn't
see anything outside.</i>

881
01:11:32,267 --> 01:11:34,360
<i>Rick, you'd better
come with me.</i>

882
01:11:34,436 --> 01:11:36,233
<i>We've got
work to do.</i>

883
01:11:36,404 --> 01:11:38,634
<i>Wheeler's dead.
What happened?</i>

884
01:11:38,706 --> 01:11:40,435
Two.38 slugs
in the back.

885
01:11:40,508 --> 01:11:41,907
Where? When?

886
01:11:41,976 --> 01:11:45,537
Dumped out of a car on Third and
Wilmer, about a half an hour ago.

887
01:11:46,314 --> 01:11:48,339
<i>Doesn't she ever
go to bed?</i>

888
01:11:49,984 --> 01:11:51,611
<i>We're going over there
and get a few answers.</i>

889
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:52,846
You stay here Paul.

890
01:11:52,921 --> 01:11:55,549
<i>It'll go smoother if she
doesn't see you just now.</i>

891
01:12:15,944 --> 01:12:17,707
Hello.
This is Paul.

892
01:12:17,946 --> 01:12:19,072
Now, listen.

893
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,341
McAllister and Eckstrom are
on their way over to see you.

894
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,405
<i>They'll be there
in a minute.</i>

895
01:12:22,484 --> 01:12:24,384
<i>They'll ask you a lot of questions,
but they don't know a thing.</i>

896
01:12:24,452 --> 01:12:25,749
<i>So don't let them
scare you.</i>

897
01:12:26,621 --> 01:12:28,054
<i>No, I'll be over here.</i>

898
01:12:28,122 --> 01:12:30,352
But in case you do see me,
you know me. Remember that?

899
01:12:30,425 --> 01:12:32,052
All right, Paul.

900
01:12:41,002 --> 01:12:42,629
Who is it?
Police.

901
01:12:52,714 --> 01:12:54,944
<i>Where does he
think he's going?</i>

902
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:57,379
What is this anyway? Routine check.

903
01:12:57,452 --> 01:12:59,784
<i>We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Harry Wheeler.</i>

904
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:02,216
Get him out
of my bedroom.

905
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,655
All right.

906
01:13:25,146 --> 01:13:27,114
<i>Won't you sit down,
Miss McLane?</i>

907
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:30,478
May I?

908
01:13:34,055 --> 01:13:35,920
When was the last time
you heard from him?

909
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:37,651
Who?
Harry Wheeler.

910
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:40,389
<i>Who's Harry Wheeler?</i>

911
01:13:40,862 --> 01:13:43,695
<i>He's been getting some
space in this week's papers.</i>

912
01:13:44,465 --> 01:13:46,524
<i>I'm afraid I don't
read the paper.</i>

913
01:13:46,601 --> 01:13:49,092
<i>And I don't know
anyone named Harry.</i>

914
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:52,439
<i>Don't you have to know a man to
give him a key to your apartment?</i>

915
01:13:52,507 --> 01:13:54,304
<i>What's that
supposed to mean?</i>

916
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:57,606
Harry Wheeler was in this
apartment tonight at 11:00.

917
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,110
<i>I wasn't even
here at 11:00.</i>

918
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,478
No, you were at
the Twilight Room.

919
01:14:01,549 --> 01:14:02,914
But there was
a man here.

920
01:14:03,051 --> 01:14:05,383
<i>If it wasn't Wheeler,
who was it?</i>

921
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,220
If there was anyone
here, he broke in.

922
01:14:08,289 --> 01:14:10,621
What did Wheeler
come up here for?

923
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,191
<i>Maybe it wasn't Wheeler.</i>

924
01:14:13,294 --> 01:14:15,819
<i>You knew his partner,
too, didn't you?</i>

925
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,158
No sale.

926
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:19,064
<i>You didn't find what you were looking for,</i>

927
01:14:19,133 --> 01:14:21,124
<i>so why don't you
let me go to bed?</i>

928
01:14:21,202 --> 01:14:24,729
<i>I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you, Lona.</i>

929
01:14:24,839 --> 01:14:27,171
<i>Wheeler's partner
double-crossed him,</i>

930
01:14:27,241 --> 01:14:29,801
which means he double-crossed you, too.

931
01:14:29,877 --> 01:14:33,574
He shot Wheeler tonight and
dumped his body into the street.

932
01:14:34,515 --> 01:14:36,540
Which means
nothing to me.

933
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:42,019
<i>If I didn't know better, I'd
think we were on the wrong track.</i>

934
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,359
Call the stakeout. Have
him bring over the log.

935
01:14:48,062 --> 01:14:50,155
<i>We've been keeping
a score sheet on you.</i>

936
01:14:50,465 --> 01:14:52,990
<i>We'll go over it together,
point by point.</i>

937
01:15:02,644 --> 01:15:03,702
Sheridan.

938
01:15:03,778 --> 01:15:06,576
Rick. Eckstrom wants the log brought over.

939
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:07,807
<i>I'll be right over.</i>

940
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,277
Hello, Lona.

941
01:16:20,788 --> 01:16:22,278
<i>I might've known.</i>

942
01:16:22,857 --> 01:16:24,222
<i>You're just the type.</i>

943
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:27,985
You want me
to stick around?

944
01:16:28,062 --> 01:16:29,757
<i>Afraid she doesn't
like you, Paul?</i>

945
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:31,025
Better wait for us.
Right.

946
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:58,950
Operator?
Give me the police.

947
01:16:59,026 --> 01:17:00,084
Hurry!

948
01:17:58,419 --> 01:18:00,319
<i>Cars 49 and 60,</i>

949
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:04,916
<i>Park Crest Hotel, 322
French Street. Code Three.</i>

950
01:18:08,429 --> 01:18:10,021
Sheridan.
Eckstrom there?

951
01:18:11,265 --> 01:18:12,926
<i>Well, you'd better go
over and give him this.</i>

952
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,592
A woman in the building,

953
01:18:14,702 --> 01:18:17,500
an Ann Stewart,
apartment 421.

954
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:19,199
She just called in.

955
01:18:19,273 --> 01:18:21,707
<i>Says she saw the man we're
after. Whatever that means.</i>

956
01:18:21,776 --> 01:18:24,404
Oh, and...
Yeah, two more cars.

957
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,907
She mentioned McAllister,
so it may be a break.

958
01:18:27,982 --> 01:18:29,381
Yeah, you never know.

959
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:31,245
Okay.

960
01:19:09,924 --> 01:19:10,913
<i>Who's there?</i>

961
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:12,657
Miss Ann Stewart?

962
01:19:12,727 --> 01:19:13,819
Yes?

963
01:19:13,895 --> 01:19:15,726
The police.
Did you put in a call?

964
01:19:22,603 --> 01:19:24,366
<i>...no reason. When I can't sleep, I drive.</i>

965
01:19:24,438 --> 01:19:25,803
Who pays your rent?

966
01:19:25,873 --> 01:19:27,272
I do!
How?

967
01:19:27,341 --> 01:19:29,400
What about the call
you got from RTV?

968
01:19:29,477 --> 01:19:30,774
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

969
01:19:30,845 --> 01:19:32,710
<i>It wasn't the rating service
that called. We checked on it.</i>

970
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,247
Who was it?

971
01:19:34,315 --> 01:19:36,010
<i>If there was a call,
I don't remember it.</i>

972
01:19:36,584 --> 01:19:39,485
<i>Now, if you do as you're
told, you won't get hurt.</i>

973
01:19:39,553 --> 01:19:40,884
What are you
going to do?

974
01:19:48,195 --> 01:19:50,925
<i>Well, think it over.
You've got until tomorrow.</i>

975
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:52,693
<i>But don't try to leave unless
you want to be picked up</i>

976
01:19:52,767 --> 01:19:54,257
and booked for vagrancy.

977
01:20:04,111 --> 01:20:05,442
Get your coat.

978
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,538
Come on! Come on!

979
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:19,955
Sheridan?

980
01:20:21,595 --> 01:20:23,358
I guess
he went downstairs.

981
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:24,591
Yeah.

982
01:20:43,317 --> 01:20:44,909
<i>Yes?
It's Paul. Open up.</i>

983
01:20:45,453 --> 01:20:46,750
Turn the lights out first.

984
01:20:50,257 --> 01:20:52,282
<i>Get dressed, we're getting out of here.</i>

985
01:20:52,827 --> 01:20:54,124
Go on, hurry!

986
01:21:05,306 --> 01:21:07,001
<i>Where's Sheridan?
Upstairs.</i>

987
01:21:07,074 --> 01:21:09,338
<i>If he was upstairs I wouldn't
be asking you about him.</i>

988
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:10,775
<i>Didn't he just
give you a message?</i>

989
01:21:10,845 --> 01:21:12,176
What are you talking about? What message?

990
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:15,044
<i>A woman called. Said she saw
the guy we're looking for.</i>

991
01:21:15,116 --> 01:21:16,140
What was her name?

992
01:21:16,217 --> 01:21:17,844
Stewart. 421...

993
01:21:54,522 --> 01:21:55,784
Ann!

994
01:22:24,885 --> 01:22:28,446
All right. All right, now
go out... Hold on a second.

995
01:22:30,224 --> 01:22:33,193
<i>Sheridan, the blonde, the girl who
just called in, they're all missing!</i>

996
01:22:35,096 --> 01:22:37,189
You and Schaeffer search
the building, top to bottom.

997
01:22:37,264 --> 01:22:38,822
Who are we after?

998
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:42,562
Maybe Paul Sheridan. Take a
prowl car and cover the back.

999
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:33,015
<i>What's wrong? A prowl car
right behind Wheeler's.</i>

1000
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:34,179
<i>Do you think they know
it's Harry's car?</i>

1001
01:23:34,255 --> 01:23:35,415
<i>I don't know.</i>

1002
01:23:35,489 --> 01:23:37,252
Maybe they just
happened to park there.

1003
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:40,825
<i>There's one way
to find out. Here,</i>

1004
01:23:41,996 --> 01:23:44,294
<i>that car over there,
here's the key to the trunk.</i>

1005
01:23:44,365 --> 01:23:46,697
<i>Open it. You'll find a bag, bring it here.</i>

1006
01:23:46,767 --> 01:23:47,859
Take it!

1007
01:23:50,471 --> 01:23:51,563
Be smart.

1008
01:24:15,329 --> 01:24:17,126
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

1009
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:18,790
When I fire,
get behind the car.

1010
01:24:19,533 --> 01:24:20,522
Duck!

1011
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:38,848
<i>It's clear that way. Go to Western
and Wilshire, wait for me there.</i>

1012
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:40,250
<i>What are you going to do?
I'm going to get that car.</i>

1013
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:41,913
<i>Now go on hurry! No, wait!
You can't get that money!</i>

1014
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:43,251
<i>Will you go, Lona?
Please, don't try to get...</i>

1015
01:24:43,324 --> 01:24:44,382
Go on!

1016
01:25:10,918 --> 01:25:12,215
Hold it, Sheridan!

1017
01:25:28,102 --> 01:25:29,865
Radio George Street,
emergency.

1018
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:39,670
<i>I'm sorry, Rick.</i>

1019
01:25:39,747 --> 01:25:42,079
So am I, Paul. So am I.

1020
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:32,160
I thought
I told you to go.

1021
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:40,306
<i>We really didn't need that money, did we?</i>

1022
01:27:12,873 --> 01:27:14,272
<i>Come on,
I'll walk you home.</i>
