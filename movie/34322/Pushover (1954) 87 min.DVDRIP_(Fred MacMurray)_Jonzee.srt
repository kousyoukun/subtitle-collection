1
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,263
Need some help?

2
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,966
<i>Maybe you've got
the motor flooded.</i>

3
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,405
What do I do
about it?

4
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,101
Want me to try?

5
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,777
All right.

6
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,380
Shove over.

7
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,585
Did you like
the show?

8
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,817
Yeah.

9
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,492
How did you know
I was there?

10
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,957
I saw you. Wondered why you were alone.

11
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,194
I wondered the same thing about you.

12
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,834
<i>It doesn't seem
to be flooded.</i>

13
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,899
<i>I'll take a look
under the hood.</i>

14
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,062
<i>I don't know. I don't think
you're getting any spark.</i>

15
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,033
<i>I'm not?</i>

16
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,938
Not enough to
start the car.

17
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,333
Any suggestions?

18
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,274
Yeah, I think you ought to
have a mechanic look at it.

19
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,712
<i>There's an all-night
garage on Normandie.</i>

20
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,012
You could call them
from a bar over here.

21
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,783
All right.

22
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,685
<i>I'd feel much better
if you went with me.</i>

23
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,794
That was the idea.

24
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,498
Another drink?

25
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,012
You could play the record again, though.

26
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,606
Okay.

27
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,550
Oh. Did you get it started?

28
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,916
<i>Have to tow it in
to the shop, ma'am.</i>

29
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,614
<i>I can't seem to locate the trouble.</i>

30
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,081
How long will
that take?

31
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,589
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

32
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,557
Could I call
you here?

33
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,094
Bartender, what
time do you close?

34
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,789
<i>12:00. We don't get much late trade.</i>

35
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,589
<i>All right. I guess we'll have to call you.</i>

36
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,792
Okay.

37
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,366
Well...

38
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,239
You like to
take me home?

39
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,798
Now?

40
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,202
Sure.

41
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,649
Your place
or mine?

42
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,355
Surprise me.

43
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,256
Yeah.

44
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,696
<i>Well, there's
no particular hurry.</i>

45
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,607
<i>Well, why don't you check with
the mechanic and call me back?</i>

46
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,602
Hollywood 33-449.

47
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,038
Right.

48
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,472
Mind?

49
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,210
No, help yourself.

50
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,755
<i>That was with plain water, wasn't it?</i>

51
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,057
Uh-huh.

52
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,829
Sorry?

53
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,095
Sorry? For what?

54
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,567
Picking me up.

55
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,307
Is that what you
call it, a pick-up?

56
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,707
<i>Don't you?</i>

57
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,737
Do you get
picked up often?

58
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,139
Would you care?

59
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,817
<i>If I said yes, it wouldn't
make much sense, would it?</i>

60
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,816
No.

61
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,752
<i>I guess it wouldn't.</i>

62
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,830
<i>The answer's yes.</i>

63
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,874
<i>Would it make any sense if I told
you it's never happened before?</i>

64
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,341
Maybe.

65
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,224
Funny.

66
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,163
When I saw you come into
the theater tonight, I...

67
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,367
I thought how
awful it was.

68
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,870
The two of us
there all alone.

69
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,498
<i>It doesn't make sense,
a girl like you.</i>

70
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,633
New car, mink coat.

71
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,109
Perfume,
$50 an ounce.

72
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,167
<i>It's $100.</i>

73
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,971
Still alone. Why?

74
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,274
Uh-uh.

75
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,110
<i>No questions.
Don't spoil it.</i>

76
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,715
Yeah.

77
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,326
How long
will it take?

78
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,719
Wait a minute.

79
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,157
<i>He says the
distributor's shot.</i>

80
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,598
Take a couple of hours,
maybe longer, to fix it.

81
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,027
He wants to know
where to deliver it.

82
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,095
You tell him.

83
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:12,942
You can deliver it here. 3916
Crescent Way, apartment D.

84
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,240
Right.

85
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,402
<i>We're doing
the best we can.</i>

86
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,440
After all, identifying Harry
Wheeler as one of the men

87
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,705
who knocked off the bank
was no break, it was...

88
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,676
Yes, sir.

89
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,746
All right, sir,
as soon as I get it.

90
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,313
What about you, Rick?
Anything from St. Louis?

91
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,652
<i>Wheeler was there till five
weeks ago. That's all we got.</i>

92
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,749
Nothing on who he left with? Why he left?

93
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,623
<i>They're working on it.</i>

94
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,686
About time
you showed.

95
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,788
Have you got
anything for us?

96
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,390
Well, nothing
definite, no.

97
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,401
What do you want? Another
three days with her?

98
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,164
<i>I didn't ask for
the first three.</i>

99
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,638
<i>Okay, Paul. We've been
drawing blanks here, too.</i>

100
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,698
You can have more time
with her if you need it.

101
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,868
<i>I'm satisfied
she's Wheeler's girl.</i>

102
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,371
Oh? Why?

103
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,744
Well, it seems to add up. We
spend a lot of time at my place,

104
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:22,839
never at hers.

105
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,508
She obviously has
a generous friend

106
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,949
<i>who's not around
at the moment.</i>

107
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,987
Last night, when I tried to
take her to the Lombardy Club,

108
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,385
she backed off.

109
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,547
<i>What's
the connection?</i>

110
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,216
<i>It's one of
Wheeler's hangouts.</i>

111
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,987
<i>You think that's
enough to go on?</i>

112
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,527
<i>Don't you?</i>

113
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,562
<i>lt'll have to do.</i>

114
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,394
Harris, bring in
that layout.

115
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,428
Oh, what about
the girl?

116
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,259
I told her I was going to
be out of town for a while.

117
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,599
<i>Oh, I got this from the bank
yesterday. It's the official count.</i>

118
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,700
$210,000, and no record
of the serial numbers.

119
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,773
This is a layout of the
building the girl lives in.

120
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,213
This is her
apartment here.

121
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,183
<i>We'll take over this one across the way.</i>

122
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,515
Be sure you avoid contact
with the rest of the tenants.

123
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,452
<i>There'll be two men in
this room at all times,</i>

124
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,990
one on the phone tap,
the other at the window.

125
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,424
Another man will be in the
lookout car out in front.

126
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,758
If Wheeler shows, the man in
the lookout car phones upstairs

127
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,160
and the other two
will be ready for him

128
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,892
when he steps out
of the elevator.

129
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,263
Sounds real simple.

130
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,323
It is.

131
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,337
<i>If you ask me, Wheeler's
halfway to Peru right now.</i>

132
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,066
All that dough and a
murder rap hanging over him.

133
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,407
<i>Look, get it out of your
head that Wheeler won't show.</i>

134
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,714
<i>This is all we've got to go on,
and I want you expecting him.</i>

135
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,807
Did you ever read the
statistics on bank jobs, Paddy?

136
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,485
Ever hear of a heist
man being picked up

137
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,647
afterward on a highway
or international border?

138
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,553
They find them holed up in the big city.

139
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,458
<i>And 70% of the time,
there's a dame with them.</i>

140
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,822
How about it, Paul?

141
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,762
Think Wheeler
will be around?

142
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,423
<i>Yeah, he'll be around.</i>

143
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,165
Everything
straight then?

144
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,099
How about those back
doors? They kept locked?

145
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,073
<i>They can't be opened from the outside.</i>

146
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,041
<i>You'll be in charge
of the stakeout, Paul.</i>

147
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,873
And you know
what I want.

148
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,505
You want Wheeler.
I want him alive.

149
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,409
Remember that,
all of you.

150
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,713
<i>Dead, he can't tell us where the
money is or who his partner was.</i>

151
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,220
Alive, he can save us
a lot of dirty work.

152
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,817
What watch
shall we take?

153
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,879
The important one.

154
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,290
<i>I'm putting Briggs, Fine
and Corrick on the day watch.</i>

155
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,921
<i>Doesn't figure that Wheeler'll
show up in broad daylight.</i>

156
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,157
<i>Well, I guess
that's everything.</i>

157
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,131
Pick yourself up a copy
of this from Harris.

158
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,131
Paul...

159
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,374
Keep your eye on Paddy.

160
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,842
<i>I'd like to see him
get his pension.</i>

161
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,171
<i>And he won't
if he slips again.</i>

162
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,173
Find Briggs and
send him in to me.

163
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,758
Paul, Rick.
Hiya, boys.

164
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,097
Been a long afternoon. Anything doing?

165
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,500
She went out once.
Briggs tailed her.

166
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,128
She took her car around for a lube job.

167
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,194
Might mean
something.

168
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,297
<i>She's waiting for
someone all right.</i>

169
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,671
<i>Doesn't know what
to do with herself.</i>

170
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,801
Smoked a pack of cigarettes
in the past two hours.

171
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,277
Coffee if you want it. Thanks.

172
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,280
All the comforts of
home. She get any calls?

173
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,610
<i>Nope. Everything's
in the log there.</i>

174
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,115
Have fun.
See you.

175
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,243
At 7.00 a.m.
Yeah.

176
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,952
2:46, called in for...

177
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,258
For nothing.

178
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,518
Have you got her? Uh-huh.

179
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,365
What do you think?

180
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,760
<i>You're right.
He'll be around.</i>

181
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,064
<i>To me she's still a babe,
like 30 million others.</i>

182
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,695
Want me to take
the phone?

183
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,597
<i>No, I'll take it.</i>

184
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,876
<i>She's going
to make a call.</i>

185
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,597
<i>The time is 7:10
and 40 seconds.</i>

186
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,828
New car, mink coat, and
no clocks in the joint.

187
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,565
Probably the story
of her life.

188
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,469
<i>You just don't
like women, Rick.</i>

189
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,133
What keeps
you single?

190
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,676
Maybe I like
them too much.

191
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,873
<i>We've seen all kinds
since we joined the force.</i>

192
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:31,576
B-girls, hustlers, blackmailers,
shoplifters, drunks.

193
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,313
<i>You know I think I'd still get married,</i>

194
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,149
if I could find
a half-honest woman.

195
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,617
Must be
a few around.

196
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,884
Watch yourself. Those
few might just be smarter.

197
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,029
<i>I don't know what makes a dame like
that tie up with a guy like Wheeler.</i>

198
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,091
Money. What else?

199
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,869
<i>She's scared. Scared of being
hungry and scared of being alone.</i>

200
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,470
You can wrap up her whole
life in that one word.

201
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,835
Money?
Hmm.

202
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,966
<i>It's nice, but it doesn't
make the world go round.</i>

203
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,168
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

204
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,471
<i>Do you know anybody that's happily married</i>

205
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,772
<i>that hasn't got
plenty of it?</i>

206
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,838
My old man was. And he had to
stand the wolf off all his life.

207
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,783
Yeah, my folks
hated each other.

208
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,149
Fighting all the time.

209
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,816
<i>It's about the only thing
I can remember about them.</i>

210
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,686
One long, endless quarrel.

211
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,123
And always
about money.

212
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,418
Never about
anything but money.

213
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,699
When I was a kid, I promised
myself that when I grew up,

214
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,995
<i>I'd have plenty
of dough.</i>

215
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,963
Plenty of it.

216
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,093
<i>I'm doing all right.</i>

217
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,936
<i>I owe the China-man $2.30
on last week's laundry bill.</i>

218
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,806
<i>How'd we get
on to this?</i>

219
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,607
I think I made a nasty crack about women.

220
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,818
<i>Paul, she's going out.</i>

221
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,184
<i>I'll take it.</i>

222
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,532
Change your mind about going out of town?

223
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,698
Yeah.

224
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,744
I took my car to have it serviced today.

225
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,383
Happened to mention the
trouble I had with it,

226
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,585
so the mechanic looked
at the distributor.

227
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,053
<i>He said it hasn't
been touched in months.</i>

228
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,533
<i>My car didn't start the other night
because you did something to it.</i>

229
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,694
Why?

230
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,999
<i>Can't think of
a fast answer?</i>

231
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,536
Yeah, I can think
of an answer.

232
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,774
I saw you walk
into the theater.

233
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,882
I liked the way
you walked.

234
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,074
As simple as that?

235
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,210
Sure, why not?

236
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,810
<i>You're a liar.</i>

237
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,117
<i>You're also a cop.</i>

238
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,853
You need a drink.

239
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,158
What do the police
want from me?

240
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,354
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

241
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,591
Harry wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

242
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,162
Harry?
Wheeler.

243
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,402
<i>He's a friend
of mine.</i>

244
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,565
Harry Wheeler
has no friends.

245
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,675
He did me
a favor once.

246
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,711
And you returned it.

247
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,577
<i>He didn't do me
that big a favor.</i>

248
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,516
<i>So you're a friend
of Harry's?</i>

249
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,779
<i>That's right.</i>

250
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,314
From St. Louis.

251
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,986
He dreamed up
a pet name for me.

252
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,388
He did that
for a lot of girls.

253
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,428
He never called me
anything else.

254
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,756
What was it?

255
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,327
He was kind of nervous when
I talked to him on the phone.

256
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,994
<i>He gave me your name
and address, that's all.</i>

257
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,162
A cop! A dirty,
lying cop!

258
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,298
Wait a minute, baby, take
it easy. Take it easy.

259
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,155
These last few days,

260
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,256
<i>they weren't all just cop, were they, Paul?</i>

261
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,418
No.

262
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,261
No, I learned everything I
wanted to know that first night.

263
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,231
I went on seeing you
because I wanted to.

264
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,225
<i>But it's over.</i>

265
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,433
What happens now?

266
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,408
<i>I'm taking
you downtown.</i>

267
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,941
A man named Eckstrom wants
to ask you some questions.

268
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,477
Well,

269
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,642
<i>it's been weird
knowing you.</i>

270
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,489
Not that
it matters, Paul,

271
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,855
<i>but I didn't know
that Harry was</i>

272
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,827
what he is.

273
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,423
He told me he owned
apartment houses in St. Louis.

274
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,465
He buy you
that coat?

275
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,797
Yes.

276
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,680
Who was his partner?

277
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,809
Partner? Yeah, there
were two on that bank job.

278
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,749
We only identified Wheeler.

279
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,913
<i>I told you he didn't have any friends.</i>

280
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,884
I met him at a nightclub on
the Strip. He came in alone.

281
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,192
<i>He was always alone
if he wasn't with me.</i>

282
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,523
And you let him
set up house for you?

283
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,425
All right.

284
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,729
He bought me
my clothes and my car

285
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,860
and a lease on a decent place to live in.

286
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,002
<i>Things I've never had
in my whole life.</i>

287
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,532
<i>If you'd known where his dough came from,</i>

288
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,168
would you still
have taken it?

289
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,905
<i>Money isn't dirty.
Just people.</i>

290
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,682
<i>How's he getting
in touch with you?</i>

291
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,114
<i>He'd be crazy to try and you know it. Why?</i>

292
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,349
It was just a lucky break
that we got a line on you.

293
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,255
<i>He probably figures
you're clear.</i>

294
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,021
Maybe he will try.

295
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,661
<i>I suppose my
phone's tapped.</i>

296
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,669
<i>What happens to Harry
if he's caught?</i>

297
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,363
He killed a man.

298
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,005
And the $200,000?

299
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,708
What do you think?

300
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,508
<i>I think it's
a lot of money.</i>

301
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,641
<i>And right now
Harry's got it.</i>

302
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,217
<i>That's right.</i>

303
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:49,813
Paul...

304
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,455
Go on home.

305
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,523
<i>Why?
I wouldn't know.</i>

306
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,856
Go on before I start thinking about it.

307
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,571
<i>I don't want
to go, Paul.</i>

308
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,204
Not yet.

309
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:25,153
We could have that money, Paul, you and I.

310
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,391
<i>Look, Harry's going to
die no matter what we do.</i>

311
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,430
<i>So what difference will it make
if he shows up and he's killed?</i>

312
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,560
<i>Be a perfect set-up
for a cop, wouldn't it?</i>

313
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,193
I could knock him off, hide the
money and call the meat wagon.

314
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,034
No questions asked.

315
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,538
Think what that money
could mean to us, Paul.

316
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,304
To you and me.

317
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,973
And I thought
I was using you.

318
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,578
Get out.

319
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,314
Get out!

320
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:43,820
<i>Where'd she go?</i>

321
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,887
Just drove around,
going no place.

322
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,492
Might have been trying to
make a contact or something.

323
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,969
She looks a little
frustrated at that.

324
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,832
Should one of us go down and relieve Paddy?

325
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,732
Hey, you with me?
What?

326
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,606
I thought one of us ought
to go down and relieve Paddy.

327
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,042
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I'll do it.</i>

328
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,544
<i>What's she doing?</i>

329
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:05,778
<i>Hanging drapes. Oh,
you mean Wheeler's dame.</i>

330
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,046
<i>She's sitting over there
staring at the wall.</i>

331
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,788
<i>There's a little nurse
next door. Always busy.</i>

332
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,921
<i>Hasn't stopped
moving for a minute.</i>

333
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,952
<i>Hello. What's holding you up?</i>

334
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:53,715
Where are you?

335
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,817
At the bowling alley.
Where else?

336
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,657
<i>Don't tell me you
forgot about it?</i>

337
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,561
<i>I'm sorry, Rick,
I did forget about it.</i>

338
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,157
I woke up this morning with a fat headache.

339
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,667
<i>I think I'd better
skip it today, huh?</i>

340
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,027
Sure.

341
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:07,095
<i>Brew yourself some thick black
coffee. I'll see you tonight.</i>

342
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,831
Right.

343
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,046
<i>Why don't
you sit down?</i>

344
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,484
Give your feet a rest.

345
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,747
<i>I'm all right.</i>

346
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,516
Are you?

347
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,323
What do you
mean by that?

348
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,793
<i>You've been looking kind of
bad the last couple of nights.</i>

349
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,159
Trouble sleeping
daytimes?

350
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,693
Yeah, yeah, the... So many
kids in the neighborhood.

351
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:39,070
<i>The minute I get home, take a big
double shot, and wham, I'm asleep.</i>

352
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,938
<i>I'll have to
try that.</i>

353
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,969
<i>Why don't you go down and relieve Rick?</i>

354
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,875
Right.

355
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,657
<i>But why can't
I go up to the...</i>

356
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,726
<i>Please. Thanks a lot for the ride
home, but I've got to get upstairs.</i>

357
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,600
<i>But what's your hurry? It's early yet.</i>

358
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,765
<i>I'm awfully tired.
Uh, thanks anyway.</i>

359
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:49,830
Now wait a minute.

360
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,307
<i>Look, why don't you go up
and get out of that uniform,</i>

361
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,673
<i>and we'll go out and
have a drink some place.</i>

362
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,508
Some other time. Good night. No.

363
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,207
Now just a minute.
Give me back my purse.

364
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,873
<i>I'll give it to you
when you come down. Okay?</i>

365
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,349
<i>Now you're being very
childish. Give it back.</i>

366
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,510
<i>No, you're not going to get it. Hey.</i>

367
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,985
No, I said.

368
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,646
<i>Forget it. It's not worth
it. Now wait a minute.</i>

369
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,122
<i>You're going to come down...
The lady said good night.</i>

370
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,590
<i>I guess you
didn't hear.</i>

371
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,422
<i>Why don't you mind your
own business, buddy?</i>

372
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:14,091
Now give the lady back
her purse and take a walk.

373
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,894
<i>Look, chum, I don't
think it's any of your...</i>

374
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,298
Be a nice fellow and
catch yourself some air.

375
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,840
Thank you.
Very much.

376
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,279
It was a pleasure.

377
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:36,012
<i>You did that like... As if
you'd done it before a few times.</i>

378
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:38,921
I was a bouncer once,
a long time ago.

379
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,956
<i>Maybe I should
learn how it's done.</i>

380
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,755
It might
come in handy.

381
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,194
<i>Wouldn't it be simpler
just to avoid that type?</i>

382
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,859
I really am grateful for what you did.

383
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,289
Never know for sure.
Some women like that kind.

384
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,991
<i>Oh, well I don't.</i>

385
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,691
<i>Not that it matters, but I
didn't have a date with him.</i>

386
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,636
<i>I'm a nurse, and he goes with a
friend of mine at the hospital.</i>

387
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,765
He offered me a lift home, and
I made a mistake and accepted it.

388
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,901
<i>You don't have to
explain it to me.</i>

389
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,577
<i>Oh, no, it's
just that I...</i>

390
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,981
<i>I guess I didn't want you
to have a bad opinion of me.</i>

391
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,277
<i>Don't ask me why.</i>

392
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,681
<i>All right, I won't.</i>

393
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,750
<i>Shouldn't I offer you a cup
of coffee or something?</i>

394
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,482
It seems the least
I could do.

395
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,387
After you learn
that hammer lock.

396
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,982
<i>I won't need it. My
roommate hasn't left yet.</i>

397
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,755
<i>She's a nurse, too.
Night shift.</i>

398
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,627
Maybe some
other time.

399
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,125
Oh. All right.
Well, good night.

400
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,792
Good night.

401
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,439
This is Paul. I may have to hang up fast.

402
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,302
Take the stairs and go up on
the roof. I want to talk to you.

403
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,982
<i>Right now. Don't even
bother to finish that drink.</i>

404
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,351
Sorry for the delay. I got tied up.

405
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:55,289
<i>It's all right. The girl's
going out. I'll take her.</i>

406
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,169
Over here, Paul.

407
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,418
You win.

408
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,455
<i>Couldn't have
taken much more,</i>

409
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:08,897
wondering what
was happening,

410
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,130
waiting for the phone to
ring and scared it might.

411
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:16,537
Thinking of you, wanting to
see you, wanting you to call me.

412
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,936
I know.

413
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:22,936
<i>This isn't going
to be easy.</i>

414
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,575
<i>We've got to keep our heads every second.</i>

415
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,415
<i>Your phone's tapped and there are
three men watching you day and night.</i>

416
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,584
<i>Harry's coming here.
Maybe tomorrow.</i>

417
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,627
Tomorrow?
That soon?

418
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,821
<i>You've got
to stop him.</i>

419
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,124
<i>How? I don't know
where he is.</i>

420
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,562
<i>Well, he'll call
first, won't he?</i>

421
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,894
Yes, but he... Well then, stall him.

422
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,628
<i>And don't answer your
phone unless I'm on the tap.</i>

423
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,226
Paul, will you
listen to me?

424
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,463
<i>It doesn't matter
if anyone hears.</i>

425
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,631
Harry told me exactly
what to say when he calls.

426
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,401
<i>And if I say anything else, he won't...</i>

427
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,341
What did he tell
you to say?

428
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:03,115
<i>When he calls, he'll ask me
what TV program I'm looking at.</i>

429
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,718
<i>If everything is clear, I'll
say I'm not looking at TV.</i>

430
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,224
<i>You're not
looking at TV.</i>

431
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,025
<i>Yes, and that's it.</i>

432
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,028
<i>He'll show up here
10 or 15 minutes later.</i>

433
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:13,791
<i>Here? Do you think he'll
have the money with him?</i>

434
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:14,854
Yes.

435
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,594
<i>Can't you tell him to
meet you someplace else?</i>

436
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,398
<i>No! If I say anything but what he
told me to say, it's a signal to run.</i>

437
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:21,738
<i>He'll show up right
after he calls?</i>

438
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,672
10 or 15
minutes later.

439
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,131
All right.

440
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,478
All right.
Now remember,

441
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,780
<i>you're not to answer your
phone until after 7:00</i>

442
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,111
<i>when I'm on the tap.</i>

443
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,616
When Wheeler calls, you
give him the all-clear.

444
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,381
Then you leave, fast.

445
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,979
<i>One man will tail you and I'll
change places with the man outside.</i>

446
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,389
Have you got an extra
key to your apartment?

447
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,791
No, but maybe...
Never mind.

448
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,920
When you go, leave the
door open so I can get in.

449
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:45,985
How long
do I stay away?

450
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,430
<i>You don't come back
until you call me first.</i>

451
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,230
<i>If it's all over, I'll
be there to take the call.</i>

452
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,030
<i>If you don't get
an answer, stay away.</i>

453
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,637
Have you got it
all straight?

454
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:56,935
Yes.
You sure?

455
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,168
Uh-huh.
All right.

456
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,335
Now go down
in your car

457
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,140
and drive around for a
while and then come back.

458
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:03,181
<i>I'll be right
behind you.</i>

459
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,846
<i>Couldn't I drive
to your place?</i>

460
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:08,744
No.

461
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:12,246
<i>No, we can't take any
more chances. Now, go on.</i>

462
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,525
Be careful, Paul.

463
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,340
Man!

464
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,708
The redhead
on the third floor?

465
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,405
<i>Isn't that the most...</i>

466
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,040
Well, you only get out of a sweater
what you put into it, I always say.

467
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,606
Yeah. You said it
twice this morning.

468
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,584
Let me have a look.

469
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,059
Answer your
phone, Blondie.

470
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,975
<i>What's going on?</i>

471
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,512
Still in the bedroom.

472
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,707
<i>She's not going
to answer it.</i>

473
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,279
<i>That's funny.</i>

474
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,188
You just missed
something.

475
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,262
What happened?
Her phone rang,

476
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,422
half a dozen times.

477
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:27,965
She just
ignored it.

478
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,022
<i>How'd she react?</i>

479
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,068
<i>Couldn't tell. She was in the bedroom.</i>

480
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,727
Maybe she knows
her phone is tapped.

481
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,035
<i>You're sure she wasn't in
the shower or something?</i>

482
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,802
Just stood in the bedroom
and stared at the phone.

483
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,901
Almost hate
to leave.

484
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,377
This may be
the big night.

485
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,937
Yeah. I can hardly tear myself away.

486
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,548
Well, enjoy
the view.

487
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,949
<i>We'll see you.
Good night.</i>

488
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,112
If that call was supposed
to mean something,

489
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,987
<i>she isn't
showing it.</i>

490
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,955
<i>Probably
her roommate's party.</i>

491
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,930
Must be her night off
or something.

492
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,859
<i>How do you know
it isn't her party?</i>

493
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,332
<i>She's tired.</i>

494
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:13,371
I saw her come home
tonight, and she was beat.

495
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,304
<i>You'd never know it
to look at her now.</i>

496
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,580
Well, this thing will
probably go on all night.

497
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,176
What do you care?

498
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,241
<i>I don't.</i>

499
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:35,853
Maybe I do. I find myself watching
her like I was her father or something.

500
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,661
I wait for her
to come home.

501
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,254
<i>When she's late,
I worry about her,</i>

502
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,232
<i>wonder what
she's doing.</i>

503
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:46,461
<i>And, uh, who she's doing
it with. Is that the idea?</i>

504
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,669
Yeah, something like that.

505
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,836
At least I feel I know
her well enough to...

506
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,211
<i>She's going
to answer it.</i>

507
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,979
<i>Hello.</i>

508
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,385
<i>Good evening. This is
the RTV Rating Service.</i>

509
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:07,789
<i>Would you tell me what program
you're watching right now?</i>

510
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,622
<i>TVprogram, that is.</i>

511
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,452
<i>I'm not watching TV.</i>

512
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:13,631
<i>I see. Thank you.</i>

513
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,399
Did you ever hear
of an RTV Rating Service?

514
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:21,598
No.

515
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,197
<i>See what she's doing.</i>

516
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:28,939
<i>She's gone
into the bedroom.</i>

517
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,547
<i>She's going out, Paul.
This may be it.</i>

518
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,885
Like me to take her
this time?

519
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,978
<i>I'd give my right arm to nail
that babe and her boyfriend.</i>

520
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,546
Okay, Rick. Go ahead. Good luck.

521
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,532
<i>Operator.
Mobile operator.</i>

522
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:24,363
<i>One moment, please.</i>

523
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,803
<i>Mobile operator.</i>

524
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,305
Give me
WJ 8-2-3-1-1.

525
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,731
<i>Your name and number?</i>

526
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:33,505
Sheridan.
Hollywood 9-5-2-6-4.

527
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:34,669
Hurry it up, please.

528
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:35,838
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

529
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,222
<i>There's no answer, sir.</i>

530
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,520
No answer?

531
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,754
<i>There's got to be an answer. Try it again.</i>

532
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,030
<i>Yes, sir.
WJ 8-2-3-1-1.</i>

533
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,906
<i>What's up, Paul? Your
job, that's what's up.</i>

534
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,709
<i>The effects from... I'm sorry,
Paul, but all I did was...</i>

535
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,578
<i>I know. We'll talk
about it later.</i>

536
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,015
<i>I'll take over in the car. You go upstairs.</i>

537
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:49,019
Sure, Paul, but I...

538
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,188
What is it?
Wheeler.

539
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,430
<i>He's gone in. We've got to call Rick.</i>

540
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,767
<i>No! No, Rick's
not up there.</i>

541
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,068
<i>The girl went out.
He's tailing her.</i>

542
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,836
<i>Then what'll we do?</i>

543
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:14,103
Well?

544
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:15,303
<i>When he finds out
she's not up there,</i>

545
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,371
he may get scared
and run.

546
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,346
<i>If he doesn't, we'll go up
and take him there. Come on.</i>

547
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:37,931
<i>Eckstrom don't need to know
about what happened, does he?</i>

548
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:39,693
What?
Eckstrom.

549
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,401
Does he have to
know about...

550
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,799
If nothing
goes wrong, no.

551
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,990
<i>I don't want to lose
my pension, Paul.</i>

552
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,222
But I

553
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,364
<i>guess you'll do
what you got to do.</i>

554
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,532
<i>I'll give you
every break I can.</i>

555
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:19,103
<i>If you'd been on the job, I'd
have taken him at the elevator,</i>

556
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:21,202
the way Eckstrom
wanted it.

557
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,247
You better hope
nothing goes wrong.

558
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,932
Hold it, Wheeler!
I got him!

559
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,495
<i>Now, let's go.</i>

560
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,798
Where?
Downtown.

561
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,844
<i>But first we'll pick up the money, huh?</i>

562
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,344
You got it
in your car?

563
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,315
<i>Let's go
find out, huh?</i>

564
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,364
This it?
Yeah.

565
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:52,130
Locked?
Yeah.

566
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,966
<i>Let's have
the keys.</i>

567
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:10,284
Looks like
the whole bundle.

568
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,914
<i>What'd you do with your
partner, Wheeler? Kill him?</i>

569
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,089
Okay, Paddy,
close the satchel.

570
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,897
What happened? He jumped you. What else?

571
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,336
<i>Why'd you shoot him?
I could have handled him.</i>

572
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,341
<i>Why, you're half-drunk. For
all I knew he had your gun.</i>

573
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,868
<i>Well, what now?
I don't know.</i>

574
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,073
Eckstrom will crucify us.
He wanted him alive.

575
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,706
<i>There'll only
be one goat.</i>

576
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:39,875
Me.

577
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:41,107
No.

578
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:44,214
<i>No, there's a way out.
Give me a hand, Paddy.</i>

579
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,984
<i>What're you doing?
I'm saving your skin.</i>

580
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:53,357
<i>Tomorrow, I'll drive the
car someplace and leave it.</i>

581
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,490
<i>They'll find it and we'll be in the clear.</i>

582
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,830
All we have to do is keep our mouths shut.

583
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,764
<i>What's the gimmick?</i>

584
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,905
Gimmick? You doing all this for me?

585
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,669
Why not?

586
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:06,306
<i>I don't know.</i>

587
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,439
<i>But I'd rather lose
my pension than...</i>

588
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,281
When they find Wheeler, will
they find that money, too?

589
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,780
What kind
of a crack is that?

590
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:18,486
<i>Maybe I'd better call Eckstrom right now?</i>

591
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,818
I gotta know, Paul.

592
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:21,085
I gotta know the money will be there.

593
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,922
Sure, it will be there!

594
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,061
Then give me
the keys.

595
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,957
<i>We'll both drive the car away tomorrow.</i>

596
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,632
Okay, Paddy.

597
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:32,959
You keep them.

598
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:35,896
<i>We'd better get back.</i>

599
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,446
<i>What'll it be?</i>

600
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,506
Same as hers.

601
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:28,812
Hello.

602
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,833
<i>I'm afraid I gave you
the wrong impression.</i>

603
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:54,935
I doubt it.

604
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,209
No really, you remind me of someone.

605
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,880
<i>Haven't you
ever met me before?</i>

606
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,817
Hundreds of times.

607
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:05,018
<i>I don't get it.</i>

608
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:07,489
<i>And you won't,
so try someplace else.</i>

609
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,082
<i>No. You've got
the wrong idea.</i>

610
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,754
<i>I'm not just fresh, I'm sure
that I've met you someplace.</i>

611
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:13,791
What...

612
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:16,723
Uh, will there be
anything else, sir?

613
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:36,148
<i>Hello.
It's me, Paul.</i>

614
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:38,054
<i>It's done.</i>

615
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:39,589
Is everything all right?

616
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,557
<i>There's a complication,
but I can handle it.</i>

617
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,058
Get back here.

618
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,186
<i>What happened? I'll talk to you later.</i>

619
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:51,261
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

620
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,462
<i>We're having a little party next
door and ran out of ice cubes.</i>

621
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,937
<i>Could I borrow some? I'm
sorry. I can't help you.</i>

622
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,079
<i>How'd it go, Rick?</i>

623
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:48,057
Another dry run.
I think she spotted me.

624
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:49,251
Why?

625
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,158
She made a call from the Twilight
Room and came right back here.

626
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,197
<i>It means she spotted me or
knows her phone's tapped.</i>

627
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:55,391
Or both.

628
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,093
Or neither.
Maybe.

629
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:00,434
<i>Hey, you're up
kind of late, Lieutenant.</i>

630
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:01,698
Something break?

631
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:02,761
<i>Our man's in town.</i>

632
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:07,238
Spotted in a drug store on the
east side earlier this evening.

633
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,076
<i>I'd hoped you might
have him here for me.</i>

634
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:10,636
<i>Well, we'd hoped
the same thing.</i>

635
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,306
<i>I'm afraid
I haven't.</i>

636
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:13,509
Why not?

637
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,347
<i>The dame acts like she
knows her phone's tapped.</i>

638
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,977
Made a call
from a bar tonight.

639
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:18,954
Probably touted
him off.

640
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:20,854
<i>Then you've
been here alone.</i>

641
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,859
For the last
hour, yeah.

642
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,258
All quiet?

643
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:26,592
<i>Her phone rang once. That's all.</i>

644
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,662
Check the neighborhood,
Sheridan.

645
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,759
Parked cars, alleys.

646
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:33,997
<i>I'll wait here
a while.</i>

647
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:35,398
Right.

648
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:49,517
What time did you leave
tonight, Rick, to tail her?

649
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:50,849
About 10:30.

650
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:53,386
What time did you
get back?

651
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,390
A minute ago. Why?

652
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,928
I phoned here a half dozen
times between 10:50 and 11:15.

653
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,395
No answer.

654
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,059
Some thing from the car parked outside.

655
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:08,294
<i>I gave him a chance to
explain. Why didn't he?</i>

656
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,430
Talk to Paddy?

657
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,639
He had nothing
to offer either.

658
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:16,543
<i>But he's scared
to death.</i>

659
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:20,540
<i>You and Sheridan are
fairly close, aren't you?</i>

660
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,150
<i>That's right.</i>

661
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,278
<i>But I'm not trying
to cover for him.</i>

662
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,152
<i>Maybe Paul's trying to
do it for Dolan.</i>

663
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,486
Why?

664
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,719
Why not ask Dolan?

665
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,419
<i>I'm asking you.
And I want an answer.</i>

666
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:36,225
When I followed her I
drove past the lookout car.

667
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,460
<i>Paddy wasn't in it.</i>

668
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,396
When I got to
the intersection,

669
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,105
I saw him go
into a bar.

670
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,934
I guess that bar was
just a little too close.

671
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,445
Paul, we... Shut up
and get back in the car.

672
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:08,224
Eckstrom talk to you?

673
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:10,665
<i>He knows something's
up. What'd you tell him?</i>

674
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,099
<i>Nothing I didn't
have to. He knew.</i>

675
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,399
<i>He doesn't know anything.
He just thinks he does.</i>

676
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,201
He gave me a phony job
to get me out of the room.

677
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,073
<i>Give me the keys
to Wheeler's car.</i>

678
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:21,941
<i>I'll get it out of here while
we've still got a chance.</i>

679
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,570
Come on!
Give me the keys!

680
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:26,138
<i>We're only making things worse, Paul.</i>

681
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,351
<i>I'm goin' up and tell Eckstrom
just the way it happened.</i>

682
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,011
<i>You're not going
to tell him anything.</i>

683
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,884
<i>I'm in this, too,
remember?</i>

684
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,181
Why?

685
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,549
<i>You were just
coverin' for me.</i>

686
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:37,457
<i>Isn't that right? And
Eckstrom'll throw the book at me.</i>

687
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:38,517
<i>Who do you think
you're kiddin'?</i>

688
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,757
<i>You'll come out
sweet as a rose.</i>

689
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,229
A hero for trying
to protect a buddy.

690
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,860
<i>Look, Paddy, Eckstrom
can't prove a thing.</i>

691
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,965
Why throw away
your pension?

692
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:51,474
Because I spent 25 years
being a dumb, honest cop.

693
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,967
<i>And I'm stuck with it. Wait a minute.</i>

694
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,917
<i>What's the idea?</i>

695
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:02,919
<i>You didn't do
anything for me.</i>

696
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,283
<i>You're after
that dough.</i>

697
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:07,756
<i>That's why you came down looking for me.</i>

698
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:10,256
You knew Wheeler
was going to show.

699
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:11,918
Now wait a minute, Paddy.

700
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:14,123
<i>Nope. We're both going up
and tell it just like it...</i>

701
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,535
<i>Doesn't answer.
Come on.</i>

702
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,808
<i>Tell 'em to get here as fast
as they can, but no sirens.</i>

703
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,937
And keep this
from the press boys!

704
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,713
I heard a shot!

705
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,086
Paddy?

706
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:55,190
Dead?

707
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,260
Rick, get those people
back to bed.

708
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:00,969
<i>We don't want a crowd
around here.</i>

709
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,431
All right, folks,
back on the sidewalk.

710
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:03,905
<i>What's going on, officer?
We heard the shot.</i>

711
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,408
Just a slight accident.
Back on the sidewalk, please.

712
00:59:06,477 --> 00:59:08,741
<i>What do you think?
I don't know.</i>

713
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,746
Powder burns,
his own gun.

714
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:12,281
Why would he
kill himself?

715
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,010
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

716
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,676
<i>Then you think
he didn't?</i>

717
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,920
Where were you tonight
around 11:00?

718
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:28,487
I was upstairs. Why?

719
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,930
<i>No, you weren't.</i>

720
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,195
We know where Dolan was. Where were you?

721
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,930
You know
where Dolan was?

722
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,733
McAllister saw him.

723
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:38,632
<i>I told him
I'd cover for him.</i>

724
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,343
<i>I tried to get him on the car
phone about 10:30, he didn't answer.</i>

725
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:42,436
I know.

726
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:44,413
The operator gave me
the message just now.

727
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,141
I came down to see what
had happened to him.

728
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,151
<i>Found he'd gone over to the bar.</i>

729
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,744
He was scared. He kept
talking about his pension.

730
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:53,887
I brought him back here.

731
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,858
<i>I tried to make him understand
I wouldn't say anything,</i>

732
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,727
<i>but I guess
he wasn't listening.</i>

733
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,123
<i>Well, you'd better
get back upstairs.</i>

734
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,633
<i>We've still got
a job to do here.</i>

735
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:05,793
Yeah.

736
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:15,378
<i>There's not much point keeping
a stakeout now, is there?</i>

737
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:17,571
You got any
better ideas?

738
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:38,828
Yeah, right away.

739
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:02,256
<i>Oh, look, there's
been an accident.</i>

740
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,350
Wonder what happened?

741
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:04,724
Wanna go over?
Maybe you can help.

742
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:05,784
<i>No, they don't
need us.</i>

743
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:06,989
<i>They'd be the first to say so.</i>

744
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,463
<i>Oh, it's so late.</i>

745
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:09,794
Come on.

746
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,165
<i>Are you sure you won't change
your mind and come with us, Ann?</i>

747
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:13,328
No, you all go on.

748
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,392
All right.
And have fun.

749
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:15,961
<i>You know the Crockett's
number if you need me.</i>

750
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,199
<i>Oh, don't worry.</i>

751
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:18,673
Give us a call. All right. Bye.

752
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:21,006
Nighty night.
Bye.

753
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,832
<i>He's dead.
I shot him.</i>

754
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:50,931
What do you mean?
Paddy Dolan.

755
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:52,168
What happened?
I killed him.

756
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,732
The poor, dumb, harmless...

757
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:54,936
He pulled a gun on me.

758
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:56,809
It went off. It was
an accident. I...

759
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,516
Are they after you?
No.

760
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:10,890
<i>But everything's
gone wrong.</i>

761
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,120
Paddy and...

762
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,253
And that
girl downstairs,

763
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,161
she saw me in your apartment. What girl?

764
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:17,256
The one that lives
next to you. The nurse.

765
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,131
<i>Does she know who you
are? I don't think so.</i>

766
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,794
<i>But she'll remember me.
She'll remember me good.</i>

767
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:22,429
<i>Paul, look, we've got the
money. Why don't we get out now?</i>

768
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:24,804
<i>We haven't got the money! The car's gone.</i>

769
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,843
How? Paddy must have moved it.

770
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,802
<i>He couldn't have
moved it far.</i>

771
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:30,346
It must be around here
someplace close.

772
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:33,407
Maybe we could
spot it from up here.

773
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:37,180
<i>McAllister's
still down there.</i>

774
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:39,554
<i>You take that side.
I'll look over here.</i>

775
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,355
Go on upstairs, Rick.

776
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:19,461
<i>Who tells
Paddy's wife?</i>

777
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,128
That goes with my job.

778
01:03:22,733 --> 01:03:25,224
What are you going to
say? He killed himself?

779
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,565
What else can I say?

780
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:32,604
Get those people
out of there.

781
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:45,382
Anything serious?

782
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,347
No.

783
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,328
<i>You know, you're a bitter
disappointment to me.</i>

784
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:01,496
Oh?

785
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,163
The other night.

786
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,231
You were just
doing your job.

787
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:08,537
<i>You are a policeman,
aren't you?</i>

788
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:17,779
Paul!

789
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:22,749
<i>That's it.</i>

790
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:25,192
Go down to your apartment, stay
there a few minutes, and then leave.

791
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:27,287
I want the man that follows
you kept out at least an hour.

792
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,353
What are you going to do?

793
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,332
<i>I'm going to put Wheeler's body
where it'll be found tonight.</i>

794
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,890
Why? Why take
any chance now?

795
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,731
<i>Tomorrow we... I can't do
it in the broad daylight.</i>

796
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:35,863
<i>And if that girl sees
me again, I'm through.</i>

797
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:39,636
<i>When they find the body, the stakeout
will be over and I'll be away from here.</i>

798
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:43,836
<i>Everything's going to
be all right? Sure. Sure.</i>

799
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,748
You have a wonderful way
of sidestepping questions.

800
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,153
Shall I just stop
asking them?

801
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,814
Right now, yes.

802
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,383
But save them
for next week.

803
01:04:58,028 --> 01:04:59,393
Next week?

804
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:01,995
<i>You wouldn't be
asking for a date?</i>

805
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:04,199
<i>I can't even answer
that for sure.</i>

806
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,235
Is your name
in the book?

807
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,094
<i>Ann Stewart,
with a "W."</i>

808
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,297
<i>But you'd better call me at the hospital.</i>

809
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,067
After our party tonight,
we may be evicted.

810
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,199
Was it that bad?

811
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,709
<i>I didn't think so, but the
people next door apparently did.</i>

812
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:15,937
People next door.

813
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,775
<i>You don't mean 423?</i>

814
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:20,241
Yes. Why not?
What happened?

815
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,577
Well, nothing, really. I went over
to borrow some ice cubes from him.

816
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,848
<i>Him? You mean
her, don't you?</i>

817
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:27,883
No, I mean him.

818
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:41,830
What time was it?

819
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,236
Well, about 11:00.

820
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:46,400
Is he important?

821
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:49,343
He may have killed a man
last week and another tonight.

822
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:58,145
Do you think you could recognize
him if you saw him again?

823
01:05:58,388 --> 01:06:00,686
Yes. I think I could.

824
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,559
<i>Then you'll be hearing from
me sooner than I thought.</i>

825
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,958
Good night.

826
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:18,697
Wheeler was here.
In her apartment.

827
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:21,700
When? When you were out looking for Paddy.

828
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:23,070
<i>How'd you find out
about it?</i>

829
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,171
The nurse. She tried to
borrow some ice cubes.

830
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:27,341
He gave her
a fast brush-off.

831
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,815
223 please.

832
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:31,013
Mitchell?

833
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,850
When Eckstrom gets in,
have him call me.

834
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:35,121
McAllister. Right.

835
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,586
Could she
identify him?

836
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,629
Well, who else
could it be?

837
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,357
<i>What's the
blonde doing?</i>

838
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:42,864
The usual things.

839
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:45,629
<i>If there's anybody in there
with her, she doesn't know it.</i>

840
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:48,396
Do you think the nurse
scared him off?

841
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,299
<i>I don't know.</i>

842
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,237
She said he opened the
door before she knocked,

843
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,800
as if he was leaving.

844
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:56,943
<i>Well, then when he found
out his girl wasn't up there,</i>

845
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,037
<i>he probably got nervous
and... That's just it.</i>

846
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,672
<i>Why wasn't she?</i>

847
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,817
<i>I can't spot it, but
something's wrong somewhere.</i>

848
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:07,154
<i>And what happened to Paddy,
that doesn't fit either.</i>

849
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:09,692
Eckstrom must have scared
him out of his mind.

850
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:12,291
Do you really think
Paddy killed himself?

851
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,456
If you were going to check out,
would you put a.38 slug in your belly?

852
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,124
Nobody kills
himself like that.

853
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,667
Least of all a cop.

854
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:20,600
I know Paddy like
I know my own self.

855
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,104
<i>He wouldn't have done it. Not
that way, or any other way.</i>

856
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:25,801
<i>And he certainly wouldn't have
let Wheeler get that close.</i>

857
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,207
Maybe he did.

858
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:28,301
No.

859
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,841
You know
what I think, Paul.

860
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,750
I think whoever killed Paddy was
right there in the car with him.

861
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,253
Sitting right there
beside him.

862
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:42,852
Hello.

863
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,551
All right,
give him a message.

864
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:48,460
Wheeler paid us a visit
about 11:00 tonight.

865
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,522
The lady in
apartment 426.

866
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,600
Yeah, she went over
to borrow some ice cubes.

867
01:10:31,528 --> 01:10:32,859
She there?

868
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:35,361
<i>She just came in.
Where'd she go?</i>

869
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:38,231
Nowhere. Anything
happen over there?

870
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:40,030
<i>No, it's all quiet.</i>

871
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,499
Know where she went?

872
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,062
To the beach.

873
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,168
Looked at the water
exactly three minutes,

874
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,040
came right back here.

875
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:50,872
Why?

876
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:51,936
<i>It doesn't
make sense.</i>

877
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,676
<i>Well, she probably figured
there's only one man</i>

878
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,115
watching her place,
wanted to draw him off.

879
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:56,379
Why? Nothing
happened over there,

880
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,785
<i>and Schaeffer didn't
see anything outside.</i>

881
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:37,051
<i>Rick, you'd better
come with me.</i>

882
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,924
<i>We've got
work to do.</i>

883
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:41,325
<i>Wheeler's dead.
What happened?</i>

884
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,126
Two.38 slugs
in the back.

885
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,598
Where? When?

886
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,228
Dumped out of a car on Third and
Wilmer, about a half an hour ago.

887
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:51,030
<i>Doesn't she ever
go to bed?</i>

888
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,302
<i>We're going over there
and get a few answers.</i>

889
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:55,537
You stay here Paul.

890
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:58,240
<i>It'll go smoother if she
doesn't see you just now.</i>

891
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:20,398
Hello.
This is Paul.

892
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:21,763
Now, listen.

893
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:24,032
McAllister and Eckstrom are
on their way over to see you.

894
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:25,096
<i>They'll be there
in a minute.</i>

895
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,075
<i>They'll ask you a lot of questions,
but they don't know a thing.</i>

896
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:28,440
<i>So don't let them
scare you.</i>

897
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:30,745
<i>No, I'll be over here.</i>

898
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,043
But in case you do see me,
you know me. Remember that?

899
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:34,743
All right, Paul.

900
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,320
Who is it?
Police.

901
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:57,635
<i>Where does he
think he's going?</i>

902
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:00,070
What is this anyway? Routine check.

903
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:02,475
<i>We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Harry Wheeler.</i>

904
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:04,907
Get him out
of my bedroom.

905
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:06,346
All right.

906
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,805
<i>Won't you sit down,
Miss McLane?</i>

907
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:33,169
May I?

908
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,611
When was the last time
you heard from him?

909
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,342
Who?
Harry Wheeler.

910
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,080
<i>Who's Harry Wheeler?</i>

911
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:46,386
<i>He's been getting some
space in this week's papers.</i>

912
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,215
<i>I'm afraid I don't
read the paper.</i>

913
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,783
<i>And I don't know
anyone named Harry.</i>

914
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,130
<i>Don't you have to know a man to
give him a key to your apartment?</i>

915
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:56,995
<i>What's that
supposed to mean?</i>

916
01:13:57,066 --> 01:14:00,297
Harry Wheeler was in this
apartment tonight at 11:00.

917
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,801
<i>I wasn't even
here at 11:00.</i>

918
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:04,169
No, you were at
the Twilight Room.

919
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,605
But there was
a man here.

920
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:08,074
<i>If it wasn't Wheeler,
who was it?</i>

921
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,911
If there was anyone
here, he broke in.

922
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,312
What did Wheeler
come up here for?

923
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:15,882
<i>Maybe it wasn't Wheeler.</i>

924
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:18,510
<i>You knew his partner,
too, didn't you?</i>

925
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,849
No sale.

926
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,755
<i>You didn't find what you were looking for,</i>

927
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:23,815
<i>so why don't you
let me go to bed?</i>

928
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:27,420
<i>I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you, Lona.</i>

929
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,862
<i>Wheeler's partner
double-crossed him,</i>

930
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,492
which means he double-crossed you, too.

931
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:36,265
He shot Wheeler tonight and
dumped his body into the street.

932
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,231
Which means
nothing to me.

933
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:44,710
<i>If I didn't know better, I'd
think we were on the wrong track.</i>

934
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:48,050
Call the stakeout. Have
him bring over the log.

935
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:52,846
<i>We've been keeping
a score sheet on you.</i>

936
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,681
<i>We'll go over it together,
point by point.</i>

937
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:06,393
Sheridan.

938
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:09,267
Rick. Eckstrom wants the log brought over.

939
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:10,498
<i>I'll be right over.</i>

940
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:18,968
Hello, Lona.

941
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:24,969
<i>I might've known.</i>

942
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:26,913
<i>You're just the type.</i>

943
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,676
You want me
to stick around?

944
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,448
<i>Afraid she doesn't
like you, Paul?</i>

945
01:16:32,522 --> 01:16:33,716
Better wait for us.
Right.

946
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,641
Operator?
Give me the police.

947
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:02,775
Hurry!

948
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,010
<i>Cars 49 and 60,</i>

949
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:07,607
<i>Park Crest Hotel, 322
French Street. Code Three.</i>

950
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,712
Sheridan.
Eckstrom there?

951
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,617
<i>Well, you'd better go
over and give him this.</i>

952
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,283
A woman in the building,

953
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:20,191
an Ann Stewart,
apartment 421.

954
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:21,890
She just called in.

955
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:24,398
<i>Says she saw the man we're
after. Whatever that means.</i>

956
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:27,095
Oh, and...
Yeah, two more cars.

957
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,598
She mentioned McAllister,
so it may be a break.

958
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:32,072
Yeah, you never know.

959
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,936
Okay.

960
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:13,604
<i>Who's there?</i>

961
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:15,348
Miss Ann Stewart?

962
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:16,510
Yes?

963
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:18,417
The police.
Did you put in a call?

964
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:27,057
<i>...no reason. When I can't sleep, I drive.</i>

965
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,494
Who pays your rent?

966
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,963
I do!
How?

967
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,091
What about the call
you got from RTV?

968
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:33,465
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

969
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:35,401
<i>It wasn't the rating service
that called. We checked on it.</i>

970
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:36,938
Who was it?

971
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,701
<i>If there was a call,
I don't remember it.</i>

972
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:42,176
<i>Now, if you do as you're
told, you won't get hurt.</i>

973
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:43,575
What are you
going to do?

974
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:53,616
<i>Well, think it over.
You've got until tomorrow.</i>

975
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:55,384
<i>But don't try to leave unless
you want to be picked up</i>

976
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:56,948
and booked for vagrancy.

977
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,133
Get your coat.

978
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,229
Come on! Come on!

979
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:22,646
Sheridan?

980
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,049
I guess
he went downstairs.

981
01:20:26,122 --> 01:20:27,282
Yeah.

982
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,600
<i>Yes?
It's Paul. Open up.</i>

983
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:49,441
Turn the lights out first.

984
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,973
<i>Get dressed, we're getting out of here.</i>

985
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:56,815
Go on, hurry!

986
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:09,692
<i>Where's Sheridan?
Upstairs.</i>

987
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:12,029
<i>If he was upstairs I wouldn't
be asking you about him.</i>

988
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:13,466
<i>Didn't he just
give you a message?</i>

989
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:14,867
What are you talking about? What message?

990
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:17,735
<i>A woman called. Said she saw
the guy we're looking for.</i>

991
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:18,831
What was her name?

992
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:20,535
Stewart. 421...

993
01:21:57,213 --> 01:21:58,475
Ann!

994
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:31,137
All right. All right, now
go out... Hold on a second.

995
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:35,884
<i>Sheridan, the blonde, the girl who
just called in, they're all missing!</i>

996
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:39,880
You and Schaeffer search
the building, top to bottom.

997
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,513
Who are we after?

998
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:45,253
Maybe Paul Sheridan. Take a
prowl car and cover the back.

999
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:35,706
<i>What's wrong? A prowl car
right behind Wheeler's.</i>

1000
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:36,870
<i>Do you think they know
it's Harry's car?</i>

1001
01:23:36,946 --> 01:23:38,106
<i>I don't know.</i>

1002
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,943
Maybe they just
happened to park there.

1003
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,516
<i>There's one way
to find out. Here,</i>

1004
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,985
<i>that car over there,
here's the key to the trunk.</i>

1005
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:49,388
<i>Open it. You'll find a bag, bring it here.</i>

1006
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:50,550
Take it!

1007
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:54,254
Be smart.

1008
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,817
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

1009
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:21,481
When I fire,
get behind the car.

1010
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:23,213
Duck!

1011
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:41,539
<i>It's clear that way. Go to Western
and Wilshire, wait for me there.</i>

1012
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,941
<i>What are you going to do?
I'm going to get that car.</i>

1013
01:24:43,012 --> 01:24:44,604
<i>Now go on hurry! No, wait!
You can't get that money!</i>

1014
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,942
<i>Will you go, Lona?
Please, don't try to get...</i>

1015
01:24:46,015 --> 01:24:47,073
Go on!

1016
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,906
Hold it, Sheridan!

1017
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,556
Radio George Street,
emergency.

1018
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:42,361
<i>I'm sorry, Rick.</i>

1019
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:44,770
So am I, Paul. So am I.

1020
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:34,851
I thought
I told you to go.

1021
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:42,997
<i>We really didn't need that money, did we?</i>

1022
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,963
<i>Come on,
I'll walk you home.</i>
