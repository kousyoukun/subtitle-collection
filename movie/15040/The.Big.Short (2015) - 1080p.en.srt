running out of mortgages

and so many people with
good enough jobs to buy them, right?

282
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,854
So the banks started filling these bonds

283
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,106

and if it goes bust

684
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,895
you can make 10-to-1,
even 20-to-1 return.

685
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,106
And it's already slowly going bust!

686

No one is paying attention!

689
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,950
Because the banks are too busy
getting paid obscene fees

690

to sell these bonds.

691
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,163
But wait. You are the bank.
You work for the bank.

I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat.

Let's not talk about
my margins, by the way.

which is the mortgage bond
that Michael Burry shorted.

But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.

Maybe it just came out

739
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,485
So, what am I going to do?

740
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:33,072
Throw all this unsold fish,
which is the BBB level of the bond,

741
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,616
in the garbage and take the loss?

742
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,577
No way.

Being the crafty
and morally onerous chef that I am,

744
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:42,832
whatever crappy levels
of the bond I don't sell,

745
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,917
I throw into a seafood stew.

See, it's not old fish.
It's a whole new thing!

747

And the best part is
they're eating 3-day-old halibut.

That is a CDO.

00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:33,834
That's what makes it a bubble.

1020
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,211
That's dumb, Lawrence.

1021
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,880
There's always markers.

1022
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,091
Mortgage fraud has

1023
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:42,926
quintupled since 2000

1024
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:45,888
and the average take-home pay is flat,

1025
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,431
but home prices are soaring.

1026
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,600
That means the homes
are debt, not assets.

1027
00:46:49,683 --> 00:46:51,894
So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who

1028
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:56,273
gets his hair cut at Supercuts
and doesn't wear shoes,

1029
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:59,234
knows more than Alan Greenspan
and Hank Paulson.

1030
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:00,402
Well...

1031
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,739
Dr. Mike Burry,
yes, he does. (CHUCKLES)

1032
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:06,742
That's cute. That's cute.

1033
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:09,161
Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike?

1034
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:12,206
(SIGHS)

1035
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:13,707
Lawrence,

1036
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,293
I don't know how to be sarcastic.

1037
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,755
I don't know how to be funny.
I don't know how to

1038
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:21,882
work people.

1039
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,133
I...

1040
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:25,552
I just know how to read numbers.

1041
00:47:25,636 --> 00:47:28,138
How big is your short position right now?

1042
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:29,556
Um...

1043
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,225
Just $1.3 billion.

1044
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,185
And the premiums?

1045
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,645
Well, we pay, uh,

1046
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:38,440
- roughly $80 to 90 million
- (MARTIN LAUGHING)

1047
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:40,025
each year, which is high,

1048
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:42,194
but I was the first to do this trade.

1049
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:45,739
Watch. It will pay. I may have
been early, but I'm not wrong.

1050
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,158
It's the same thing.
It's the same thing, Mike!

1051
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:53,121
You're managing a fund of,
what, $555 million?

1052
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:57,167
In six years, it'll all be gone.

1053
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,378
On one bet.

1054
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:02,631
No, the second quarter of '07 is
when the adjustable rates kick in.

1055
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:04,258
The defaults will skyrocket.

1056
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,051
Yeah. Says you.

1057
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,595
LAWRENCE: How much is eligible
for withdrawal before they do?

1058
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:10,597
Say, in the next two quarters.

1059
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,308
If your investors panic.

1060
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,896
$302 million?

1061
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,981
I...

1062
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,483
My God, Mike.

1063
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:23,944
(MIKE CHUCKLES)

1064
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,240
No one will pull out.
That would be suicide.

1065
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,742
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.

1066
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,161
But if they trust me,
and they trust me, because...

1067
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,872
No one trusts you! No one!

1068
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:38,375
I sent several emails to my investors

1069
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,544
letting them know that the...

1070
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:42,087
(EXHALES)

1071
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,590
...the second quarter of '07 is when our

1072
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,175
housing positions show returns and...

1073
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:49,803
I've been very clear.

1074
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:53,432
People will withdraw their money.

1075
00:48:54,016 --> 00:48:57,477
Lawrence, that would be so stupid.
I mean, the...

1076
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:01,064
(STUTTERS) If the fund's capitals
drop too much,

1077
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,610
then the swaps contracts are voided.

1078
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:07,946
And then the banks get to
keep all of the collateral.

1079
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,240
- MARTIN: Wait a minute. Wait.
- All of it.

1080
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,492
The contracts are voided?

1081
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,369
The contracts are voided?

1082
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,747
Holy shit!

1083
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,206
Oh, motherfucker!

1085
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:22,419
Give me my money back.

1086
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,217
Michael, do you hear me?
I want my money back.

1087
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,056
Give me my fucking money back...

1088

(LAUGHS)...you motherfucker.

1089
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:40,562
The market's in an itsy-bitsy
little gully right now.

1090
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,939
It's like everybody said,
"Okay, that was crazy.

1091
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,900
"Let's just all calm down."

1092
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:49,946
I sold that house for $350,000
the year it was built.

1093
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,783
Two years later, $480,000.

1094
00:49:52,908 --> 00:49:56,078
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.

1095
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:58,747
This couple bought it
for $650,000 last year.

1096
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,083
He'd let it go for that.

1097
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,834
Hi, John.

1098
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:03,960
(MOUTHING) No, no, no.

1099
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:05,962
It will break his heart, but he'll let it go.

1100
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:07,839
Why is he selling?

1101
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,758
MARLENE: Neither one's
working right now.

1102
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:13,387
Marlene, you'd say
they're motivated, right?

1103
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,473
As motivated as one can be
in this neighborhood.

1104
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:19,101
This house on the left,
I would say they're probably motivated.

1105
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:21,144
Wow, a lot of people
seem very motivated.

1106
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:22,312
MARLENE: Oh, it's just the gully.

1107
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:24,356
That's all. Just...

1108
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:25,857
Just nerves.

1109
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,651
So where do we stand?

1110
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:31,321
I need to talk to my wife. Um...

1111
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:32,698
MAN: This market won't last.

1112
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,574
MARK: Actually, could I talk
to a mortgage broker?

1113
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,493
Anybody you recommend?
Anybody you like.

someone. Absolutely.

So is Morgan Stanley
recruiting us? Is that it?

00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:48,714
Oh, no. No.
The bank owns our hedge fund,

1120
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:49,840
but we're not really part of it.

00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:52,426
We invest in financial service companies

1122
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:55,470
and we're trying to understand
the residential mortgage business.

1123
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:58,473
How many loans
do you write each month?

1124
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,142
- (BLOWS AIR) About 60.
- Yeah.

(LAUGHING) You own a...

1130
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:12,070
So how many of these are
adjustable-rate mortgages?

1131
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:13,822
- MAN IN BLACK: Well, most.
- Oh, yeah.

1132
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,866
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.

1133
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:19,077
The bonuses on those
skyrocketed a few years ago.

1198

Okay, look. If home prices don't go up,

1199

you are not going to be able to refinance.

1200

whatever your monthly payment is

1201
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:20,592
once it jumps up
after your teaser rate expires.

1202
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:23,053
Your monthlies could go up 200%-300%.

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,722
What?

1355
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:50,101
Vennett wants $1.9 million more
in collateral by close.

1356
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:51,477
Vennett's asking us to post collateral.

1357
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:52,979
What the hell is going on?

1358
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:55,022
We don't know, but Deutsche's
on the phone demanding payment.

1359
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:56,941
<i>Call Vennett. Call that little shit.</i>

1360
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,985
Call Vennett.
Tell him to get his ass down here.

1361
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:00,862
So subprime loans go bad,

1362
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:04,157
but subprime bonds, which are made up
of subprime loans, are more valuable?

1363
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,701
I know. They want another
$1.9 million by market close.

1364
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:08,953
What about the ratings agencies?
Moody's, S&P...

1365
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:11,456
Are they downgrading the CDOs
and mortgage bonds?

1366
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:12,623
Where are the ratings agencies at?

1367
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:14,208
They're the fucking same.

1368
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,793
No, they're all still AAA.

1369
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:18,379
What the hell?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1370
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:20,548
Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers!

1371
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:23,593
They go public, and all they care about
is their bottom line and their shit.

1372
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:25,428
Hey, Mark, that's not all.

1373
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:26,804
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.

1374
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:28,264
They called in Kathy Tao.

1375
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,475
They're trying to convince her
to make us sell our swaps.

1376
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:32,810
Apparently, tying up six years
of insurance payments

1377
01:03:32,894 --> 01:03:34,645

1378
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:35,980
<i>is not prudent investing.</i>

1379
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:37,356
What did Kathy say?

1380
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,151
Nothing yet. She keeps asking
if this is one of your crusades.

1381
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,153
Okay, I want you to walk back in there

1382
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,905
and very calmly, very politely,

1383
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,657
tell the risk assessors to fuck off.

1384
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:48,409
And then meet me over
at Standard & Poor's.

1385
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:50,036
We're gonna talk to Georgia.

1386
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:51,162
VINNIE: <i>All right. Okay.</i>

1387
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:53,164
Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office.

1388

1390
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:01,631
Uh, gentlemen?

1391
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:04,759
I spoke with Mark Baum.
He says to fuck off.

1392
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:20,900
I can't see a damn thing.

1393
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:24,779
(SIGHS) My eye doctor's always busy.

1394
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,656
I end up taking
any appointment they'll give me,

1395
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:29,075
and then the whole morning
gets shot to hell!

1396
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:31,744
So...

1397
01:04:32,245 --> 01:04:33,746
All righty,

1398
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:36,624
FrontPoint Partners,

1399
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:39,544
how can Standard & Poor's help you?

1400
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:40,878
VINNIE: Well, we don't understand why

1401
01:04:40,962 --> 01:04:43,589
the ratings agencies haven't
downgraded subprime bonds

1402
01:04:43,673 --> 01:04:46,717
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating.

1403
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,220
Well, the delinquency rates
do have people worried,

1404
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:51,097
but they're actually within our models.

1405
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,140
- So...
- VINNIE: Says you.

1406
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:56,727
...you're convinced
the underlying mortgages

1407
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:59,230
in these bonds are solid loans.

1408
01:04:59,355 --> 01:05:01,232
GEORGIA: That is our opinion, yes.

1409
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,401
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

1410
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,236
I mean, they're giving these loans

1411
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:06,571
to anybody with a credit score
and a pulse.

1412
01:05:06,654 --> 01:05:09,240
Excuse me, sir. What do you think
we do here all day?

1413
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:10,366
VINNIE: We're not sure.
That's why we're here.

1414
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:11,576
Here's what I don't understand...

1415
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:13,369
We check, recheck, recheck again.

1416
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:14,787
MARK: If these mortgage bonds
are so stable...

1417
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,581
Perhaps you could check your friend.

1418
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,666
MARK:...have you ever refused to rate...

1419
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,084
VINNIE: Ma'am, that's delusional.

1420
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,294
GEORGIA: We stand behind them.

1421
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:22,962
MARK: Georgia,
have you ever refused to rate

1422
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,340
any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?

1423
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:28,009
Can we see the paperwork
on those deals?

1424
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:30,094
I am under no obligation
to share that information

1425
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:31,262
with you, whoever you might be.

1426
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:33,055
Just answer the question, Georgia.

1427
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,141
Can you name one time in the past year

1428
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:36,559
where you checked the tape

1429
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:40,855
and you didn't give the banks
the AAA percentage they wanted?

1430
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:44,275
If we don't give them the ratings,

1431
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,277
they'll go to Moody's,
right down the block.

1432
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:50,531
If we don't work with them,
they will go to our competitors.

1433
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:54,368
Not our fault.
Simply the way the world works.

1434
01:05:58,706 --> 01:06:01,208
- VINNIE: Holy shit.
- Yes, now you see.

1435
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,295
And I never said that.

1436
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,797
They're selling ratings for fees.

1437
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:07,840
A ratings shop.

1438
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:10,760
You can afford to make less. Make less.

1439
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:12,720
Nobody said that.

1440
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:14,972
And it is not my decision.
I have a boss.

1441
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:16,390
Are you kidding me?

1442
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,850
No, I am not "kidding you".

1443
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,227
How'd your boss do on the IPO?

1444
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:21,520
MARK: Is that the angle you're taking?

1445
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:25,149
So, now, anyone who has a boss
can't be held responsible

1446
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:26,651
for doing shitty and illegal things.

1447
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:28,319
What are you, four?

1448
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:32,698
No, I am not four, Mr. Baum.
I am not, no.

1449
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:36,160
And I wonder what
your incentives might be.

1450
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:37,828
Is it maybe in your best interest

1451
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:40,915
to have the ratings change?
Is it, perhaps?

1452
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:45,252
How many credit default swaps
do you own? Hmm?

1453
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:49,173
It doesn't make me wrong.

1454
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,383
No.

1455
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:52,593

Either the banks are clueless

1474
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:12,173
and they don't know
how to value these CDOs,

1475

No problem, Dr. Burry.

1687
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:21,615
- Dr. Burry?
- Hmm?

1688
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:24,534
(CLEARS THROAT)

1689
01:18:25,202 --> 01:18:26,244
If the investors withdraw,

1690
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:29,081
what's going to happen here?
Are we done?

1691
01:18:29,206 --> 01:18:31,124
Honestly, I don't know.

1692
01:18:35,379 --> 01:18:37,089
(STAMMERS)

1693
01:18:38,799 --> 01:18:41,051
The bonds aren't going down.

1694
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:44,971
They won't move. It's possible

1695
01:18:45,389 --> 01:18:49,976
that we are in a completely
fraudulent system.

1696
01:18:51,395 --> 01:18:54,064
Or... (STAMMERS) You're wrong.

1697
01:18:58,819 --> 01:18:59,903
Sure.

1698
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:04,658
It's possible I'm wrong.
I just don't know how.

1699
01:19:09,371 --> 01:19:13,542
I guess when someone's wrong,
they never...

1700
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:16,169
They never know how.

1701
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:21,508
LEWIS: See you in the morning.

1702
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:22,676
Yeah.

1703
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:26,471
Even Bear upped their prices.

1704
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:29,558
And they keep calling us Brownhole.

1705
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:31,268
You just don't have the money
or the reputation.

1706
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:32,686
Don't take it personally.

1707
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:34,104
I don't think I have
the strip club in me tonight.

1708
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:37,858
I'm just gonna get some ginger ale
and watch some pay-per-view.

1709
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:40,318
I'll book us some flights out
for the morning.

1710
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:44,364
CHARLIE: (STAMMERS) A deal.
We need a deal, right? A deal.

1711
01:19:44,448 --> 01:19:46,241
We need a deal we can afford.

1712
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:48,660
We need a deal
that they're not gonna refuse.

1713
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:52,080
So... What can we do? We can...

1714
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:56,293
The AA tranches. What if we
bet against the AA tranches?

1715
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:57,711
Who's not gonna take that bet?

1716
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,339
We know they say
they're 95% AAA-rated,

1717
01:20:01,423 --> 01:20:03,425
but in reality they're more like 25%.

1718
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:05,927
Some of them are 0%!

1719
01:20:06,011 --> 01:20:08,638
We also know that if
the bottom tranches fail at over 8%,

1720
01:20:08,722 --> 01:20:09,890
the upper tranches are affected.

1721
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:11,183
They go to zero.

1722
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:14,394
I'll bet you right now
that those AA's are actually like B's.

1723
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:17,939
I rarely ever say these words,
but I think Charlie's right.

1724
01:20:18,273 --> 01:20:19,941
Look, Ben.

1725
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,028
The payoff

1726
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:24,946
is 200 to 1.

1727
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,073
But they're all taking
the ratings at face value.

1728
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,577
So they're charging pennies
on the dollar a bet against the AA's.

1729
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:35,040
Just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns...

1730
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:37,626
No one on the planet's
betting against AA's.

1731
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:40,629
The banks will think we're either high
or having a stroke.

1732
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:43,048
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

1733
01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:46,968
Kinda brilliant.

1734
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:50,847
This is what we did
that no one else thought of.

1735
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:53,850
Not even Baum or Burry
thought to short the AA's.

1736
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,310
But we did.

1737
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:56,937
Little Brownhole Capital.

1738
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:02,192
We're interested in shorting
some of the AA tranche of CDOs.

1739
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,069
Come on, guys, what's the angle?

1740
01:21:04,152 --> 01:21:06,446
Oh, got no angle.
We're new to this. We're just excited.

1741
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:10,283
We want to do $15 million
in swaps on the AA tranche.

1742
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:11,826
I don't understand.

1743
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,538
You can buy as much
AA tranche as you want.

1744
01:21:16,748 --> 01:21:18,875
$40 million against the AA.

1745
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,169
Brother, I will sell you
as much as you want.

1746
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:23,672
You understand perfectly, Bob.
You want the deal?

1747
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:25,757
(MEN LAUGHING)

1748
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,842
That's cool. That's all right with me.

01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:37,978
Oh! (VOCALIZING)

1751

- Don't do that. Stop. Stop.
- (CONTINUES VOCALIZING)

1752
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:43,316
- Stop that.
- Charlie.

1753
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:45,485
Stop it! Stop.

1754
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:48,989
What?

1755
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:51,783
Do you have any idea what you just did?

1756
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,868
Come on. We just made
the deal of our lifetimes!

1757
01:21:53,952 --> 01:21:55,120
We should celebrate.

1758
01:21:55,203 --> 01:21:57,122
You just bet against
the American economy.

1759
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:58,707
Fuck, yeah, we did!

1760
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:00,750
- Fuck, yeah!
- Which means...

1761
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:03,503
Which means if we're right...

1762
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:07,924
If we're right, people lose homes.
People lose jobs.

1763
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:11,177
People lose retirement savings.
People lose pensions.

1764
01:22:11,303 --> 01:22:12,470
You know what I hate
about fucking banking?

1765
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:14,097
It reduces people to numbers.
Here's a number.

1766
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:17,017
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

1767
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,602
- No.
- Did you know that?

1768
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:20,270
No, I didn't know that.

1769
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,398
We were just excited.

1770
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:27,819
Just don't fucking dance.

1771
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:30,322
CHARLIE: All right.
JAMIE: Where are you going?

1772
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:36,870
Whoa, I just got really scared.

1773
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:40,332
First of all, great show today.

1774
01:22:40,415 --> 01:22:41,875
- You were terrific.
- Thank you.

1775
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,585
Your big mouth was a revelation.

1776
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:45,378
I appreciate that.

1777
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:47,255
You worried you and your swaps
are getting played?

1778
01:22:47,339 --> 01:22:50,467
Well, this is an opportunity for you
to meet who you're betting against.

1779
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,344
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little.

1780
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:53,803
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

1781
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:55,597
JAMIE: <i>A real solid-gold asshole.</i>

1782
01:22:55,764 --> 01:22:56,848
I'm a CDO manager.

1783
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:58,016
A "CDO manager"?

1784
01:22:58,099 --> 01:22:59,517
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

1785
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,229
I didn't realize that there was
anything to manage with CDOs.

1786
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:05,190
MR. CHAU: Oh.

1787
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,485
We select the securities
that go into the CDO portfolio

1788
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:09,944
and monitor the assets.

1789
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,821
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

1790
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:14,866
Do you represent the investors
or Merrill Lynch?

1791
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:15,992
The investors.

1792
01:23:16,076 --> 01:23:17,118
You do.

1793
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:18,536
- Yeah.
- But...

1794
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:20,622
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna
send you any customers

1795
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:24,250
unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds
in your CDO.

1796
01:23:25,377 --> 01:23:28,088
Good question. Let's just say
Merrill and I have, um...

1797
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:30,799
We have a good relationship.

1798
01:23:30,924 --> 01:23:33,134
You have a good relationship
with Merrill Lynch.

1799
01:23:33,218 --> 01:23:34,886
We've been doing business
together for a long time.

1800
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:37,430
And so the CDOs that you create

1801
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:41,476
are of the highest quality
and the highest value.

1802
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,478
- Absolutely. Yep.
- Absolutely.

1803
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:47,107
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default rates?

1804
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:52,237
I assume no risk for these
products myself, Mark.

1805
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:56,074
Okay.

1806
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:00,829
So let me get this straight.
The bank calls you up.

1807
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:02,956
They give you the bonds
they want to sell.

1808
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,374
They give you clients,

1809
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:06,835
they give you money
to run your business.

1810
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:08,628
Give you fat fees for doing so.

1811
01:24:08,712 --> 01:24:10,714
But you represent the investors?

1812
01:24:10,964 --> 01:24:11,965
(CHUCKLES)

1813
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:13,299
Is that right?

1814
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:14,467
Yeah.

1815
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:16,010
But we're not
in the Merrill Lynch building.

1816
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:17,679
- Okay. Where are you?
- We're in New Jersey.

1817
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:19,848
You're 20 minutes away.

1818
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:21,850
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

1819
01:24:23,727 --> 01:24:24,853
That's funny, huh?

1820
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:26,146
That's hilarious.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1822
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:30,400
Oh, boy.

1823
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,986
Your boss is about to explode.

1824
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:34,696
No, he's too curious to explode.

1825
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:36,239
Hold on. Say that again.

1826
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:38,450
CDO "A" has parts of CDO "B".

1827
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:40,452
And CDO "B" has parts of CDO "A".

1828
01:24:40,535 --> 01:24:42,787
But then they both
get put inside CDO "C".

1829
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:44,622
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

1830
01:24:44,706 --> 01:24:46,791
A CDO of a CDO.

1831
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,209
All right?

1832
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:50,336
And then there's CDOs
made up of the opposite side

1833
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,963
of the bet you made with your swaps.

1834
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:54,507
We call them synthetic CDOs.

1835
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,801
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.

1836
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:58,595
That is fucking crazy.

1837
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,388
It's not. It's awesome.

1865
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,050
Okay. So here's how
a synthetic CDO works.

1866
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:22,011
Let's say I bet $10 million
on a blackjack hand.

1867
01:26:22,095 --> 01:26:24,597
$10 million because this hand
is meant to represent

1868
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:27,225
a single mortgage bond.

1869
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:33,606
Okay, Selena has a pretty good
hand here, showing 18.

1870
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:34,732
Dealer showing seven.

1871
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:36,860
That's a really good hand for Selena.

1872
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:38,361
Good odds. In fact,
her chances of winning

1873
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,822
<i>this hand are 8</i>7%.

1874
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:44,284
So, my odds are good.
I'm on a winning streak.

1875
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:47,036
Everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action.

1876
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,496
How could I lose, right?

1877
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,081
Now, this is a classic error.

1878
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:53,126
In basketball it's called
the Hot Hand Fallacy.

1879

01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:03,011
<i>is gonna continue to</i>
<i>happen into the future.</i>

1883
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:06,431
<i>During the real estate boom,</i>
<i>markets were going up and up</i>

1884
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,182
and people thought
they would never go down.

1885
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:10,810
So people who are watching
and think that I won't lose

1886
01:27:10,894 --> 01:27:12,353
will make a side bet.

1887
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:14,689
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.

1888
01:27:14,772 --> 01:27:16,357

1889
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:17,942
I bet you $50 million she wins.

1890
01:27:18,026 --> 01:27:20,111

1891
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:24,032
3-to-1 odds? Okay, I'll take that bet.

1892
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:27,452
RICHARD: Now, somebody else
is gonna want to make a bet

1893
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:28,661
on the outcome of their bet.

1894
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:29,954
Bet you 50 million she wins.

1895
01:27:30,038 --> 01:27:32,999
That will lead to synthetic
CDO number two.

1896
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:36,252
Hey, I bet you $200 million
that lady in the glasses

1897
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:37,921
wins that bet.

1898
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:41,174
She probably will win.
So I want a great payoff.

1899
01:27:41,341 --> 01:27:42,425
How about 20-to-1?

1900
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:43,676
Deal.

1901
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:48,306
And this will go on and on with more
and more synthetic CDOs.

1902
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:52,435

$10 million investment

2521
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:31,058
<i>And this time, even teachers.</i>

2522
02:00:32,435 --> 02:00:33,644
<i>And when all was said and done,</i>

2523
02:00:33,728 --> 02:00:35,479
<i>only one single banker went to jail.</i>

2524
02:00:36,397 --> 02:00:37,523
<i>This poor schmuck.</i>

2525
02:00:37,607 --> 02:00:40,067
<i>Kareem Serageldin from Credit Suisse.</i>

2526

<i>on a good day during the crisis.</i>

2528

Mark, can we sell now?

2529
02:00:51,495 --> 02:00:53,998
<i>The fund will make almost $1 billion.</i>

2530
02:00:54,081 --> 02:00:55,708
<i>You'll clear $200 mil, Mark.</i>

2531
02:00:56,876 --> 02:00:59,128
You know, once we sell,

2532
02:00:59,879 --> 02:01:01,756
we'll be just like the rest of them.

2533
02:01:01,839 --> 02:01:02,965
You know that.

2534
02:01:03,299 --> 02:01:04,884
<i>No, we're not.</i>
<i>We're not the bad guys here.</i>

2535
02:01:04,967 --> 02:01:08,471
<i>We didn't defraud the American people</i>
<i>and prey on their dreams</i>

2536

2537
02:01:10,222 --> 02:01:11,432

And now we get to
kick them in the teeth.

A billion dollars.

2541
02:01:23,569 --> 02:01:24,820
<i>That's right.</i>

2542
02:01:24,904 --> 02:01:27,740
<i>But we got to close out our position</i>

<i>I mean, it's now or never, Mark.</i>

2544
02:01:40,252 --> 02:01:41,671
Okay.

2545
