1
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:58,622
God, she's beautiful.

2
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,627
She's got the prettiest eyes...

3
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:03,562
and she looks so sexy
in that sweater.

4
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:06,065
I just want to be
alone with her...

5
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,068
and hold her and kiss her...

6
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:10,400
and tell her
how much I love her...

7
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:12,235
and take care of her...

8
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:13,740
Stop it, you idiot.

9
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:15,071
She's your wife's sister.

10
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:16,906
But I can't help it.

11
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,571
I'm consumed by her.

12
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:20,239
It's been months now.

13
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,748
I dream about her.

14
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:25,081
I think about her at the office.

15
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,586
Oh, Lee...

16
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,088
what am I going to do?

17
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:31,421
I hear myself
mooning over you...

18
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,927
and it's disgusting.

19
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:37,089
Before, when she squeezed
past me in the doorway...

20
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:40,225
and I smelled that perfume
on the back of her neck...

21
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:43,896
Jesus, I thought
I was going to swoon.

22
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,098
Easy.

23
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,437
You're a dignified
financial adviser.

24
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:49,602
It doesn't look good
for you to swoon.

25
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:51,611
Elliot?

26
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:54,637
Sweetheart,
have you tried these?

27
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:57,617
They're wonderful.
Holly and her friend made them.

28
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:58,948
They're fantastic.

29
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:01,113
Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

30
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:04,056
I know.
She has all the cooking charm.

31
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,252
You've got talent as well.

32
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:07,658
I've eaten five of these.

33
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:09,560
Holly, why don't you
open a restaurant?

34
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:11,064
We practically are.

35
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,896
Well, not a restaurant, but...

36
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,732
April and I are going to do
some catering.

37
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:18,898
- You're kidding.
- No. We decided.

38
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,236
Perfect.

39
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,401
We like to cook
for our friends...

40
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:26,846
so until an acting job comes,
we could do private parties.

41
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,746
Great idea.
That's where your talent lies.

42
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:31,251
I know. Get out.

43
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,082
Can I speak to you privately?

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,486
I'm her husband.
She tells me anything.

45
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,089
Hannah, I have to borrow
some more money.

46
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,593
- Don't get upset.
- Lt never upsets me.

47
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:43,426
This is the last time.
I'm keeping strict accounts.

48
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:44,931
Holly, please, don't insult me.

49
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,432
Someday
I'll pay back everything.

50
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,925
- I know. How much?
- $2,000.

51
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,430
April and I have this catering
idea that'll be great.

52
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,272
You admit we're great cooks,
right?

53
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,108
To get started,
there's things I have to buy...

54
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,272
and some old debts.

55
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:03,215
Tell me one thing.
Are we talking cocaine again?

56
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,717
I swear. I swear.

57
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:07,380
We've already got requests
to do some dinner parties.

58
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,219
Obviously I'm not going to be
a caterer forever.

59
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:11,724
We both still audition.

60
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,227
Something could come up
at any moment.

61
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,729
My days are free
for my acting class.

62
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:19,255
I haven't done drugs in a year.

63
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,927
A whimpering

64
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:21,957
Simpering

65
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:24,232
Child again

66
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,738
Bewitched

67
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:28,799
Bothered and bewildered

68
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:32,244
Mom and Dad are floating down
memory lane again.

69
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,747
- Tried the shrimp?
- Fantastic.

70
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:36,249
You've outdone yourself.

71
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:39,081
I need an antihistamine.
Mom's feeling her asthma...

72
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,587
so before she turns
into a comedian...

73
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,089
She's a comedian
when she gets up.

74
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:44,420
At least she isn't drinking.

75
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,585
Doesn't she look great
in that new dress?

76
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:49,095
She knows it, too,
'cause she's flirting.

77
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,597
Maybe when she's 80, she'll
stop straightening her garter.

78
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:53,600
She's got a garter belt.

79
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:54,931
Where's the antihistamine?

80
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:58,427
Ask Elliot.
He's got them somewhere.

81
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,269
Frederick didn't come with her.

82
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:01,865
When does Frederick ever come?

83
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,037
He's such an angry...
such a depressive.

84
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,570
I thought she was moving out.

85
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,779
A pill, he is

86
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:14,379
But still he is

87
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:20,121
All mine and I'll keep him
until he is

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,185
Bewitched

89
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,857
Watch out, you guys.

90
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,366
The kids are so adorable.

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,527
It gets so lonely on holidays.

92
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:31,197
That's why
I invited Phil Gamisch.

93
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:33,706
Hannah, he's such a loser.

94
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:35,208
He's not a loser.

95
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:37,369
He's the headmaster
at Daisy's school.

96
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:39,379
He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.

97
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:41,881
His Adam's apple jumps
up and down when he's excited.

98
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,816
He's a lot better
than your ex... husband.

99
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:46,046
He's got a good job.
He's not a dope addict.

100
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:47,383
Give me a break.

101
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,389
Am I interrupting
any sister talk?

102
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:50,890
Come in!

103
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:54,383
There are no interesting
single men at this party.

104
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:55,895
It's terrible.

105
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,558
Maybe April would like Phil.
Tall guy.

106
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,830
I met Phil.
Looks like Ichabod Crane?

107
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,837
I love that.
That's my type.

108
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:05,839
I don't believe it.

109
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:08,000
Really,
we mustn't get discouraged.

110
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,842
Hannah will invite some men who
don't look like Ichabod Crane.

111
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,176
If not this Thanksgiving...

112
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:15,681
maybe at Christmas
or New Year's.

113
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,583
If not this New Year's,
maybe next New Year's.

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,381
Must be here someplace.

115
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,357
I love that book you lent me...
"The Easter Parade."

116
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,360
You were right. It had
very special meaning for me.

117
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,692
How's Frederick?
He didn't come.

118
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,698
You know, one of his moods.

119
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:35,190
Although it wasn't a bad week.
He sold a picture.

120
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:38,534
One of his better drawings,
a very beautiful nude study.

121
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,199
Actually, it was of me.

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,367
It's a funny feeling to know...

123
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,877
you're being hung naked
in some stranger's living room.

124
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:46,880
But you can't tell
it's me, although...

125
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,745
You're turning all red, Elliot.

126
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:50,716
Really?

127
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:53,379
So what else?
What are you up to?

128
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,717
I don't know.

129
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:56,052
My unemployment's running out.

130
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,684
I was thinking of taking
some courses at Columbia.

131
00:06:58,726 --> 00:06:59,886
Like?

132
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:01,326
I don't know, exactly.

133
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,829
Sociology, psychology maybe...

134
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:05,661
I always thought I'd like
to work with children.

135
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,668
I always have clients
who are furnishing places.

136
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:11,671
Some might be interested
in buying art.

137
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:13,172
Shall I call you?

138
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,333
Sure.

139
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,843
Frederick would really
be grateful for a sale.

140
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:18,902
Dinner's ready.

141
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:21,244
You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look pretty?

142
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:23,647
I bumped into your ex... husband
the other day.

143
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:27,176
He's as crazy as ever. He was
going to get a blood test.

144
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:28,518
Mickey's such a hypochondriac.

145
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,853
How would he handle
a real illness?

146
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,916
Let's go have dinner.

147
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,287
Ladies and gentlemen...

148
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,524
Dad...

149
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,426
No. Now...

150
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,627
We're starving.

151
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,829
This is a toast...

152
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,201
Take the wine away.

153
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:45,865
This is a toast.

154
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:48,875
You know, this beautiful
Thanksgiving dinner...

155
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,367
was all prepared by Hannah.

156
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:55,871
A little help from Mary,
also Holly and April...

157
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,374
You did it.

158
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,823
And we drink to her,
and we all congratulate her...

159
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:07,657
on her wonderful accomplishment
during this last year...

160
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,995
her great success
in "A Doll's House."

161
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,159
Bravo! Bravo!

162
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,828
I played Nora...

163
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:19,669
I hate to tell you what year...
and it's very difficult...

164
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,335
to behave like Torvald's
little chipmunk...

165
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,834
without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

166
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,839
I think that lbsen would have
been damn proud of our Hannah.

167
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,011
Speech!

168
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,351
I've been very, very lucky.

169
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,847
When I had the kids,
I decided to stop working...

170
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:40,860
and devote myself
to the family...

171
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:42,361
and I've been very happy...

172
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,365
but I've always hoped
that maybe some little gem...

173
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,857
would come along and tempt me
back on the stage.

174
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:51,871
So now I got that
out of my system...

175
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:55,204
and I can go back to
what makes me happiest.

176
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,710
Bravo!

177
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:10,854
Is it my imagination...

178
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,485
or does Elliot have
a little crush on me?

179
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,655
It's funny.
I've had that thought before.

180
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:19,325
He pays attention to me
all the time...

181
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:23,166
and he blushed tonight when
we were alone in the bedroom.

182
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:25,671
I wonder if he and Hannah
are happy.

183
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:27,674
It's funny.

184
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,200
I still feel a little buzz
from his flirting.

185
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:37,851
Want some coffee or tea?

186
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,352
No, thank you.

187
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:40,853
How about something to eat?

188
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,185
Nothing.

189
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:43,689
Are you sure?

190
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:44,691
Absolutely.

191
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,353
What am I going to do with you?

192
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:48,861
God...

193
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,864
And why didn't you
come tonight?

194
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:52,866
We all had a terrific time.

195
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,197
You would have enjoyed yourself.

196
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:56,031
I'm going through a period...

197
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:58,697
where I just can't
be around people.

198
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:00,536
I didn't want to abuse anyone.

199
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:03,042
You wouldn't.
They're all so sweet.

200
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:06,872
You're the only person
I can be with...

201
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:09,212
who I really look forward
to being with.

202
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,876
You're too harsh with everyone.

203
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,909
You know that, don't you?

204
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:16,882
Isn't it enough
that I can love you?

205
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,551
You're such a puzzle...

206
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:22,551
so sweet with me and so
contemptuous of everyone else.

207
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:27,397
There was a time when you
were happy to be only with me.

208
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:29,902
You wanted to learn everything
about poetry, music.

209
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:32,906
Have I taught you
everything I have to give?

210
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,430
I don't think so.

211
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,909
Elliot said he might have
a couple of clients for you.

212
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,909
I'm sure those morons he handles
have deep feelings for art.

213
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:48,251
You never know.

214
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,085
He was just being nice.

215
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,488
Because he likes you.

216
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,685
Me?

217
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,921
Elliot lusts after you.

218
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,760
Based on what?
You never even see him.

219
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:58,765
Based on...

220
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,096
whenever you see him...

221
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,192
you come home with
books he's recommended...

222
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,363
or films you must see or...

223
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:06,372
He's my sister's husband.

224
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:09,534
If you gave him half a chance,
you'd like him.

225
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:10,873
He's very intelligent.

226
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:14,369
He's a glorified accountant,
and he's after you.

227
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,882
And I prefer to sell my work...

228
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:20,876
to people who appreciate it,
not to rock stars.

229
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,149
Understand?

230
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,893
They won't let us do the sketch?

231
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,401
They think it's too dirty.

232
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,732
They saw the rehearsal.

233
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,068
Did they figure out
what the words mean?

234
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:41,074
Mickey, it's a half hour to air.

235
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:43,406
We're short.
The show's five minutes short.

236
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:44,705
How can it be?

237
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,906
Without the sketch,
we're ten minutes short.

238
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:48,915
How can they do that?

239
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:50,917
It's because
our ratings are low.

240
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:52,077
Migraine.

241
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:55,088
We better go
to Ronnie's dressing room.

242
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,590
This kid must've taken
1,600 Quaaludes.

243
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:58,921
He can't go on.

244
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,256
Why me, Lord?

245
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:01,522
What did l...

246
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,858
Standards and practices?

247
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,693
Why suddenly
is the sketch dirty?

248
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,858
Child molestation
is a touchy subject.

249
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,368
Read the papers.
Half the country's doing it.

250
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:10,700
But you name names.

251
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:13,171
We don't name names.
We say, "The Pope."

252
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,696
That sketch cannot go on.

253
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:18,541
Who changed my sketch
about the P.L.O.?

254
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,876
I had to cut four lousy lines.

255
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,381
The whole premise is ruined.

256
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,714
You're crazy.
It's not so delicate.

257
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,048
I don't care!

258
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,544
I don't want anyone tampering
without telling me.

259
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,887
You want them cut,
I'll cut them myself.

260
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,826
Listen, instead of
the child... molestation sketch...

261
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,226
why don't we repeat...

262
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,891
the Cardinal Spelling/Ronald
Reagan homosexual dance number?

263
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,399
I don't feel good.

264
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,902
What did you do,
swallow a drugstore?

265
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,403
I lost my voice.

266
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:45,564
Jesus...

267
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:48,733
Ronnie, you have to go on
in twenty... five minutes.

268
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:52,074
Does anybody got a Tagamet?
My ulcer's killing me.

269
00:12:52,112 --> 00:12:54,672
You want a Quaalude?

270
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:56,910
Christ, this show's
ruining my health.

271
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,919
Meanwhile, my ex... partner
moves to California...

272
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:01,853
and every stupid show
he produces...

273
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:04,356
turns out to be a big hit.

274
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,360
Brother, what am I
going to do with my life?

275
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,861
Speaking of that...

276
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:12,888
I got to remember
to see my ex... wife tomorrow.

277
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:18,867
Glad you could
put in an appearance.

278
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:20,372
I got two minutes.

279
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:23,706
The show's killing me.
I got a million appointments.

280
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:26,372
I got to see new
comedians later...

281
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,381
Two minutes
on your sons' birthday.

282
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:30,383
Happy birthday, fellas.

283
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,885
Hey, guys, look.
Daddy brought presents.

284
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,387
A little hug.
What is this?

285
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:37,390
How about some action
from the kids?

286
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:38,721
How is everything?

287
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,056
Everything's good.
Everything's fine.

288
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:41,720
Open the presents now.

289
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,127
Let's see some reaction.

290
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:44,323
How's Elliot?

291
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,524
He's fine.

292
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,398
I'm trying to convince him
to produce a play.

293
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,902
Really? That'll be terrific.

294
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:52,404
I like him.
He's a sweet guy.

295
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,066
Isn't that a great mitt?

296
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:55,404
'Cause he's a loser.

297
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,410
He's awkward and clumsy like me.

298
00:13:57,444 --> 00:14:00,413
I always like an underconfident
person, you know?

299
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,347
He's been wanting a mitt.

300
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:05,351
You've always had
good taste in husbands.

301
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:06,682
That's a beauty.

302
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,188
Go out over there.
Come on, hurry up.

303
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,952
Go out by the Sung vase
and catch this.

304
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:14,483
Watch the...

305
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:16,155
Hannah's sweet.

306
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:18,858
Sometimes I still get angry
when I think of things.

307
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,196
What the hell.

308
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,701
At least I'm not paying
child support.

309
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,695
I hope there's nothing
physically wrong with me either.

310
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,731
So what's the problem this time?

311
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:31,403
This time I really think
I have something.

312
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,572
It's not like
that adenoidal thing...

313
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:37,242
where I didn't know I
had them out when I was younger.

314
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:40,253
I saw your father
this week about his sinus.

315
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,584
He complained of chest pains.

316
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:44,590
This guy's the real
hypochondriac of the family.

317
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,922
He mentioned that
you'd had some dizziness.

318
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,088
A little dizziness,
and I think I'm developing...

319
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,928
a hearing loss
in my right ear... left ear.

320
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:54,263
Sorry. My right...

321
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:56,098
Right or left. I can't remember.

322
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,535
Let's take a look.

323
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,892
You have had
a significant drop...

324
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,986
in the high decibel range
of your right ear.

325
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,394
Really?

326
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:28,231
Have you been exposed to a loud
noise recently, or a virus?

327
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:29,895
I've been perfectly healthy.

328
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,905
You know me...
I always imagine I have things.

329
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:35,066
When did you first notice this?

330
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,906
About a month ago.
What do I have?

331
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:39,411
You've had dizzy spells.

332
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:42,904
What about ringing and buzzing?
You notice any of that?

333
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:47,409
Now that you mention it,
I have buzzing and also ringing.

334
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:50,082
Ringing and buzzing.
Am I going deaf?

335
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,920
It's just in one ear.

336
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,917
Is it healthier
to have problems in both ears?

337
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:58,931
I'd like to make an appointment
at the hospital...

338
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,365
and have them run some tests.

339
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,699
The hospital?
What kind of tests?

340
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,364
Don't get alarmed.

341
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:07,032
These are just
more sophisticated...

342
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:09,541
audiometry tests
than I can run here.

343
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:10,873
It's nothing.

344
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,379
Then why go to the hospital
at all?

345
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:14,880
I hear perfectly fine.

346
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:18,373
I'm weak in the high decibels,
so I'll skip the opera.

347
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:19,385
Don't panic.

348
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:21,387
I just want to rule out
some things.

349
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:22,649
Like what?

350
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,487
It's nothing.
Will you trust me?

351
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:29,086
Hello, Dr. Wilkes?
This is Mickey Saxe.

352
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,960
I want to ask a question.

353
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:32,828
Sure, Mickey. What's up?

354
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,097
If you have
a hearing loss in one ear...

355
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:39,594
and it's not from a virus
or a loud noise...

356
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,470
what are the possibilities?

357
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:44,272
Anything. Often it's hereditary.

358
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:47,474
Flu... even a small noise
will do it.

359
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,345
Right, but nothing worse?

360
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:54,410
I guess the dark side of
the spectrum is a brain tumor.

361
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,083
Really?

362
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,116
Here's the new pages.

363
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,559
Wait. Did cards get these?

364
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:02,892
Not yet.

365
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,226
Let's hope it's good.

366
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:05,731
Really.

367
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,632
We'll be down in a minute.

368
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:11,228
What's the matter with you?
You're all white.

369
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:14,069
I feel dizzy.
I don't feel well.

370
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,574
Do you hear a ringing?

371
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,406
Is there a ringing sound?

372
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,911
I hear it.

373
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:20,412
Not that.

374
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:23,075
We're going to be
working late tonight.

375
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,583
We'll order out.

376
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:28,076
Jesus, if I have a brain tumor,
I don't know...

377
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,919
You don't.
He didn't say you did.

378
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:32,925
Naturally they won't tell you...

379
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,427
because sometimes
the weaker ones will panic.

380
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:36,929
But not you.

381
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:39,431
Do you hear a buzzing?

382
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:42,264
Come on. We got a show to do.

383
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:43,769
I can't keep focused.

384
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:45,930
But there's nothing
wrong with you.

385
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,941
Then why does he want
to run more tests?

386
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,909
He has to rule out
certain things.

387
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,104
Like what?

388
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:53,612
I don't know. Cancer.

389
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:57,447
Don't say that.
I don't want to hear that word.

390
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:59,611
But you don't have any symptoms.

391
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,884
I got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumor.

392
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:05,550
Two months ago
it was a malignant melanoma.

393
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:06,854
Naturally.

394
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:10,056
The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back...

395
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:11,563
It was on your shirt.

396
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:14,066
How was I to know?
Everyone was pointing.

397
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,568
We've got to make
some booking decisions.

398
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,230
I can't. I can't think.

399
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,398
This morning I was so happy.

400
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,237
I don't know what went wrong.

401
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,072
You were miserable this morning.

402
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,237
We got bad reviews,
terrible ratings...

403
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,576
the sponsors are furious.

404
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:31,641
I was happy, but I just
didn't realize I was happy.

405
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:39,181
These things are delicious.
What in the world are they?

406
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:41,693
Those are quail eggs.
Aren't they good?

407
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,525
My friend April makes those.

408
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:45,155
Here, try a shrimp puff.

409
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,426
I make those.

410
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,660
Thanks.

411
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,893
Excuse me.

412
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:52,131
Thank you.

413
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,603
The stroganoff is ready.

414
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:56,108
We're a big hit.

415
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:58,542
Yesterday, I auditioned
for "Come Back, Little Sheba."

416
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:00,546
That wasn't such a big hit.

417
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,639
You'll get five jobs next week.

418
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:05,310
Excuse me.
Are there any more clams?

419
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,979
A few. You like them?

420
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,987
Can't resist.

421
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:08,988
How flattering.

422
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,149
Did you try the shrimp puffs?

423
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,819
You guys are too attractive
to be caterers.

424
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,827
We're actresses.

425
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,658
Is this your first job?

426
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,163
Is the food that bad?

427
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,495
Not at all.

428
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,659
We need more sauce
for the lasagna.

429
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,164
I know. You're an actress
with a flair for shrimp puffs.

430
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,174
The shrimp puffs are Holly's.

431
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,675
I do the crepes caviar.

432
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:32,678
And the quail's responsible
for the quail eggs.

433
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,681
I stole you
a couple of extra clams.

434
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,182
Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.

435
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,014
April Knox. Hi.

436
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,178
You're Holly.

437
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,519
We're the Stanislavski
Catering Company.

438
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,353
Now I'll tell you the truth.

439
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,225
I came in because
I was bored stiff by the party.

440
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:50,195
What makes you think
we're more interesting?

441
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,198
Actually, I'm going
to listen to Aida...

442
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,097
if I'm not in your way.

443
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:55,362
Not at all.

444
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,395
We saw Pavarotti and Arnani
at the Met, and I cried.

445
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,031
I cry at the opera.

446
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,532
I go limp in the last scene
in "La Traviata."

447
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:05,544
Me, too.

448
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,205
I have a box at the Met.

449
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,215
I bring my bottle of wine...

450
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,047
I watch, and I cry.
It's disgusting.

451
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,382
What do you do?

452
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,717
I'm an architect.

453
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,051
What do you build?

454
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,420
Are you really interested?

455
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:21,249
What time do you get off?

456
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,062
It's the red one?

457
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,689
Oh, it's magnificent.

458
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:27,529
The design's deliberately
noncontextual...

459
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:30,866
but I wanted to keep
the atmosphere of the street...

460
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:34,203
on the proportions
and in the material.

461
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,707
That's unpolished red granite.

462
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:37,209
Is that what...

463
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:40,007
It has an organic quality.

464
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:41,206
Right.

465
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:43,374
Almost entirely,
wholly interdependent...

466
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,884
if you know what I mean.

467
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,887
I can't put it into words.

468
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:49,889
The important thing is,
it breathes.

469
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:53,381
You know, people pass by
vital structures all the time...

470
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:56,395
and they never take the time
to appreciate them.

471
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,056
You tune into your environment.

472
00:20:58,097 --> 00:20:59,894
It's really important.

473
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,833
What are your favorite
buildings, David?

474
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,335
You want to see some?

475
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,633
Let's do it.

476
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,816
It's just so romantic.

477
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,843
I want to put on a gown
and open the French doors...

478
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:56,048
It's French.

479
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,556
It is. It's romantic...

480
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,048
and it's got a handsome partner
sitting right beside it...

481
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:04,894
and your eye goes along, lulled
into complacency, and then...

482
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:07,331
- That's just...
- Look at this.

483
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,165
That's disgusting.
That's really terrible.

484
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,501
- Really sad.
- And it ruins everything else.

485
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,699
It does.

486
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,800
We've seen a lot of stuff today.

487
00:22:16,843 --> 00:22:19,437
Maybe we should start
thinking about going home.

488
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,577
Who gets dropped first?

489
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:24,742
Gee, I don't know.

490
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:26,581
I live downtown.

491
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:30,077
We both live downtown.

492
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:33,092
It depends on what way
you want to go.

493
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:37,927
If we took Fifth, then we'd
get to your house first.

494
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:39,261
We could do that.

495
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,097
But Fifth is so jammed,
isn't it?

496
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,602
Sometimes...

497
00:22:43,636 --> 00:22:46,104
You live in Chelsea, don't you?

498
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:50,940
I guess if you live in Chelsea,
that's probably first.

499
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,274
And then April.

500
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:53,506
Great.

501
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:02,553
Naturally,
I get taken home first.

502
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,557
Obviously, he prefers April.

503
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,049
Of course, I was
so tongue... tied all night.

504
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:11,063
I can't believe I said that
about the Guggenheim.

505
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:14,555
My stupid roller... skating joke.
I should never tell jokes.

506
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,059
Mom can tell 'em, and Hannah,
but I kill 'em.

507
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:20,572
Where did April
come up with that stuff...

508
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:24,065
about Adolf Loos
and terms like "organic form"?

509
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,577
Well, naturally.

510
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,580
She went to Brandeis.

511
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,549
I don't think she knows
what she's talking about.

512
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,552
Could you believe the way
she was calling him David?

513
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,555
"Yes, David. I feel
that way, too, David.

514
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,181
"What a marvelous space, David."

515
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:39,691
I hate April.

516
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:41,091
She's pushy.

517
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:44,062
Now they'll dump me,
and she'll invite him up.

518
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:48,557
I blew it,
and I really like him a lot.

519
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:52,059
Screw it.
I'm not going to get upset.

520
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:54,073
I've got reading to do tonight.

521
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:57,076
I'll go to bed early,
turn on a movie...

522
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,600
and take an extra Seconal.

523
00:25:20,993 --> 00:25:23,655
Oh, my goodness.

524
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,129
What are you doing here?

525
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:26,631
I'm looking for a bookstore.

526
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,133
In this section of town?

527
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,634
I'm killing time.

528
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:32,638
I have a client near here,
and I'm early.

529
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,140
How about you?

530
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:36,641
You live near here.

531
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:38,143
I do.

532
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:39,644
Where are you headed?

533
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,146
To my A.A. Meeting.

534
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,139
Why do you still go to those?
You never touch alcohol.

535
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:47,152
You didn't know me
before Frederick.

536
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:49,654
I'd start with a beer at 10 a.m.

537
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:51,657
You must have been very unhappy.

538
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,158
Unhappy and fat.

539
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:56,161
I still find the meetings
very comforting.

540
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,662
I'll never understand it.

541
00:25:57,697 --> 00:26:01,200
You're so bright
and charming and beautiful.

542
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,599
I think to myself...

543
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:04,603
"What problems
could she possibly have?"

544
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:07,105
Don't let me get started
on my childhood.

545
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,607
You know what?

546
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:11,610
There is a bookstore...
a couple blocks from here.

547
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:13,111
You'd really love it.

548
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:14,613
You would.

549
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:16,410
If you have some free time...

550
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,609
Sure.

551
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,844
Thank you.

552
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:22,682
Isn't this great?
They have everything here.

553
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:23,882
It's wonderful.

554
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:26,084
What book did you want to buy?

555
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,719
- What?
- You wanted to buy a book?

556
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:32,026
I'm killing time.
I just wanted to browse.

557
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,032
You sure picked the right place.

558
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:37,035
You can stay here
all afternoon and just read.

559
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:40,368
Unless you had some time.
We could get some coffee.

560
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:41,873
I don't have time.

561
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:43,876
I understand completely.

562
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,105
No problem.
You're busy. I...

563
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:48,477
You seem tense.
Is everything all right?

564
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:52,651
Everything's OK?

565
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:54,414
Yeah. How are you?

566
00:26:54,453 --> 00:26:56,421
I'm all right.

567
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:57,786
How's Frederick?

568
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,225
Fine. We went to the Caravaggio
exhibition at the Met.

569
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,219
It's such a treat to go
through a museum with Frederick.

570
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:06,731
You learn so much.

571
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:09,257
Do you like Caravaggio?

572
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:10,667
Who doesn't?

573
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:11,897
Look.

574
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:16,742
E.E. Cummings.
I'd like to get you this.

575
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:19,210
I can't let you get me that.

576
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:22,271
- I'd like to very much.
- I don't think so.

577
00:27:22,315 --> 00:27:25,512
I read a poem of you
and thought of his last week...

578
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:29,351
A poem of his
and thought of you.

579
00:27:29,388 --> 00:27:30,878
You'll be fine.

580
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,721
This is great.
I love E.E. Cummings.

581
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,227
I'd love to get you this...

582
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:39,288
and maybe we could
discuss it sometime.

583
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,860
Thanks a lot.

584
00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:48,373
Thanks for showing me
the bookstore.

585
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:51,376
Perhaps you could take me
to an A.A. Meeting sometime.

586
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,344
I'd love to see what goes on.

587
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:54,846
You'd love it.

588
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,009
It's really entertaining.
You'd have a good time.

589
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,019
And don't forget
the poem on page 112.

590
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:02,987
It reminded me of you.

591
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,455
Really?

592
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,119
Page 112.

593
00:28:19,071 --> 00:28:24,099
"Your slightest look
easily will unclose me.

594
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:26,873
"Though I've closed myself,
as fingers...

595
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,939
"you open always,
petal by petal, myself...

596
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:31,574
"as spring opens...

597
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:34,051
"touching skillfully,
mysteriously...

598
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:35,610
"her first rose."

599
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:40,581
"I do not know
what it is about you...

600
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:42,093
"that closes and opens...

601
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:44,961
"only something in me
understands.

602
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:50,025
"The voice of your eyes
is deeper than all roses.

603
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:53,732
"Nobody, not even the rain...

604
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,799
"has such small hands."

605
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:53,265
I wasn't too happy
with the results...

606
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,767
of your E.N.G.
Or your B.S.E.R. Either...

607
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:58,827
which is why I sent you
to tomography...

608
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,863
which was all that stuff
rolling around.

609
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:03,841
See this gray area here?

610
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:08,370
That gray area's what I had
hoped we wouldn't run into.

611
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:12,475
I'd like you to come in Monday
for a CAT scan.

612
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:15,112
A brain scan?

613
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,123
Let's take one step at a time.

614
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:20,022
We won't make any decisions...

615
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,550
until we have
all the information, all right?

616
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,866
Take it easy.

617
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,368
He didn't say you had anything.

618
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:35,363
He just doesn't like the spot
on your x... ray, that's all.

619
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:38,866
Doesn't mean you have anything.
Don't jump to conclusions.

620
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,401
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

621
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:42,471
You're in the middle
of New York City.

622
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:44,005
This is your town.

623
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,144
You're surrounded by people
and traffic and restaurants.

624
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:52,249
God, how can you just,
one day, vanish?

625
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:55,886
Keep calm.
You're going to be OK.

626
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:57,828
Don't panic.

627
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:01,594
I'm dying! I know it!

628
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:03,602
There's a spot on my lungs!

629
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:05,035
Take it easy, will you?

630
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,801
It's not on your lungs.
It's on your ear.

631
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,240
The same thing, isn't it?

632
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:12,073
I can't sleep.

633
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:16,275
God, there's a tumor in my head
the size of a basketball.

634
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:20,274
Now I keep thinking I can
feel it every time I blink.

635
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,787
He wants me to do
a brain scan...

636
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:24,790
to confirm
what he already suspects.

637
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:28,783
I'll make a deal with God.
Let it just be my ear.

638
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:31,296
I'll go deaf,
and blind in one eye, maybe...

639
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,321
but I don't want
a brain operation.

640
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:34,832
Once they go into my skull...

641
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,801
I'll wind up like the guy
with the wool cap...

642
00:31:36,836 --> 00:31:39,066
who delivers for the florist.

643
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,938
Relax. Your whole life
you run to doctors.

644
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:44,306
The news is always fine.

645
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:47,039
That's not true.
What about years ago?

646
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,606
I'm sorry to say
that you cannot have children.

647
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:56,719
Is there no chance?

648
00:31:56,755 --> 00:32:00,088
This doesn't mean that you
can't have a normal sex life...

649
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,118
but Mr. Saxe's tests indicate
that he is infertile...

650
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:05,960
small sperm volume
and infertile.

651
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:08,432
Isn't there anything I can do?
Push... ups or hormones?

652
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:09,627
I'm afraid not.

653
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:11,636
I got to get a second opinion.

654
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,069
This is the second opinion.

655
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,766
Then a third opinion.

656
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,536
I realize this is a blow.

657
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:19,203
My experience is that
many very fine marriages...

658
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:22,214
become unstable
and are destroyed...

659
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:25,445
by an inability to deal
with this sort of problem.

660
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:28,214
I hope you won't make
too much of it.

661
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:29,687
One can adopt children...

662
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:33,180
and there are various artificial
methods of fertilization.

663
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:35,193
I'm so humiliated. I don't...

664
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:37,252
Could you have
ruined yourself somehow?

665
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:38,729
How could I ruin myself?

666
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:41,358
I don't know.
Excessive masturbation?

667
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,233
You going to start
knocking my hobbies? Jesus.

668
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,238
Maybe we can adopt a child.

669
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:48,240
What about
artificial insemination?

670
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:49,741
What are you talking about?

671
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:52,209
I would get implanted
from a donor.

672
00:32:52,244 --> 00:32:53,472
A stranger?

673
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:56,037
They have these banks
where they keep them frozen.

674
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:57,605
You want a defrosted kid?

675
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,641
I want to experience childbirth.

676
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:00,811
With a stranger?

677
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,549
Just think about it.
That's all I ask.

678
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:06,820
I think that's the best show
you two ever wrote.

679
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,327
The funniest show
Mickey and I ever did...

680
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:11,852
was the one we won the Emmy for.

681
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:14,422
I think as far as laughs...

682
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:16,934
that was probably
the best thing we ever did.

683
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:18,436
It was very funny...

684
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,529
but the show about
the two Frenchmen...

685
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:22,063
that was funny and warm.

686
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:24,473
We got that idea
on that Paris trip.

687
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,977
Do you remember that trip?

688
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:28,445
You had jet lag
for six straight weeks.

689
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,143
But I guess we had fun
when we were there.

690
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:34,550
Sorry. Coffee?

691
00:33:34,587 --> 00:33:36,020
Listen, you guys, we...

692
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,522
Want some more?

693
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:41,287
We had something we really
wanted to discuss with you.

694
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:45,126
Jesus, this is very delicate...

695
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:48,258
and I'd only bring this up
amongst friends.

696
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,268
I mean, this is...

697
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:53,760
this should not go
any further than this room.

698
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:55,296
I'm all ears.

699
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,679
Hannah and I
can't have any children.

700
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:04,615
I don't want to get
into whose fault it is...

701
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,117
it's my fault...

702
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:08,585
and the details are
too embarrassing to...

703
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:11,590
We decided after
a lot of discussion...

704
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,388
that we'd try
with artificial insemination.

705
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:17,122
I'm not so sure
I like that idea myself.

706
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:20,689
I didn't really want
to go to a sperm bank...

707
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,200
have some anonymous donor.

708
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:24,702
I just... I wouldn't want that.

709
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:27,205
We felt if we were
going to do it...

710
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,707
we'd like somebody
we knew and liked...

711
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:31,403
and was warm and bright.

712
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:33,741
Feel free to say no.

713
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:36,748
We realize it has
all kinds of implications.

714
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:40,775
The point that we're making
is that we need some sperm.

715
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:47,289
Well...

716
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:50,295
my first reaction
after the initial shock...

717
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:52,320
is flattered that you'd ask me.

718
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:53,831
I'd be the father.

719
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:56,300
You'd just have to masturbate
into a little cup.

720
00:34:56,335 --> 00:34:57,768
I can handle that.

721
00:34:57,803 --> 00:35:00,271
Obviously,
we wouldn't have intercourse.

722
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:04,242
Gosh. Listen, I've got
to tell you the truth here.

723
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:07,109
- I'm a little uneasy about this.
- I know it's a lot to ask.

724
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,105
I feel for you. I do.
I'm going to cry.

725
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,244
You want my husband
to have a child with you?

726
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:15,753
Don't answer now.

727
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:20,521
Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

728
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,155
I gave blood before
and, uh, clothing to the poor.

729
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:28,166
I want to talk
about this at home.

730
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,966
I think it's a matter
for your analyst and mine.

731
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,767
And maybe my lawyer.

732
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:38,766
We understand completely
if you feel you'd rather not.

733
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:41,780
I didn't mean
to spoil the evening.

734
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:45,306
Now let's move on
to another topic.

735
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,320
So you had
my ex... partner's baby.

736
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,548
Twins.

737
00:35:49,588 --> 00:35:51,681
And maybe that did
cause some trouble...

738
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:54,056
but I think we were
drifting apart anyhow.

739
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:57,392
Now, instead of man and wife,
we're just good friends.

740
00:35:57,429 --> 00:36:00,990
Boy, love is really
unpredictable.

741
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:56,912
Say hello to Dusty Fry.

742
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:59,048
Hi, Dusty.

743
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,582
Dusty's just bought
a huge house in Southampton...

744
00:37:01,627 --> 00:37:03,094
and he's decorating it.

745
00:37:03,128 --> 00:37:04,595
It's a weird place, actually.

746
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,394
A lot of wall space.
How you doing, man?

747
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,368
I told him about your work,
and he's very excited.

748
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:14,361
I got an Andy Warhol
and a Frank Stella, too.

749
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:16,874
It's very beautiful...
big, weird.

750
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,377
If you stare
at that Stella too long...

751
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,606
the colors just seem to float.

752
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:24,172
Have you decided
about becoming a collector?

753
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:26,184
I got a lot to learn, though.

754
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:28,743
I wasn't into art
when I was a kid.

755
00:37:28,787 --> 00:37:31,415
Do you appreciate drawings?

756
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,284
She's beautiful.

757
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:42,325
But, really, I need something...
I'm looking for something big.

758
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:43,925
Show him the oils.

759
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,402
They're in the basement.

760
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:48,406
Frederick's done this new series
you would really love.

761
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,907
Are they big?

762
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:51,409
Some of them, yeah.

763
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:54,003
'Cause I got a lot
of wall space.

764
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:57,209
I don't sell my work
by the yard.

765
00:38:04,223 --> 00:38:05,383
How's everything?

766
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:08,325
Oh, you know.
I talked to Hannah.

767
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,261
She said you two
might be going...

768
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:12,763
to the country
for the weekend.

769
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:15,392
She loves to go in the woods.

770
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:16,901
But I'd go nuts.

771
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,402
It's a conflict.

772
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:22,406
I have to get
my teeth cleaned this week.

773
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:23,931
That's nice.

774
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:28,847
I figured I'd get Frederick
and Dusty together.

775
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,348
That's really nice.

776
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:33,351
This kid, he's earned
a trillion dollars.

777
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:35,478
He's got, like,
six gold records.

778
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,988
Speaking of records...

779
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,490
I bought that Mozart
trio you recommended...

780
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,993
and the man
in the record shop...

781
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:44,495
showed me another one
I think you'd love.

782
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,963
It's another Bach.
Second movement.

783
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:48,489
You have that one?

784
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,092
I'd love to hear it.

785
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:54,663
Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera... an architect.

786
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:56,173
That's nice.

787
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,870
I'd love to see her
wind up settled.

788
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:01,345
She's a tense one.

789
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:12,181
Isn't that beautiful?

790
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,987
I know this.

791
00:39:14,026 --> 00:39:15,891
Bach, F... minor Concerto.

792
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:17,919
It's one of my favorites.

793
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:26,667
Did you ever get around
to E.E. Cummings?

794
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:29,401
He's just adorable.

795
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:32,410
They have a very large
gay clientele...

796
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:34,412
where I get my teeth cleaned...

797
00:39:34,446 --> 00:39:36,914
and all the hygienists
now wear gloves...

798
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,746
because they're afraid of AIDS.

799
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:39,978
Right.

800
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:48,187
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 112?

801
00:39:48,226 --> 00:39:52,720
It made me cry, it was
so beautiful, so romantic.

802
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,168
I want so badly to kiss her.

803
00:39:57,202 --> 00:39:58,669
Not here, you idiot.

804
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:00,695
You've got to get her
alone someplace...

805
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:03,173
but I've got to proceed
cautiously.

806
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,676
This is a very delicate
situation.

807
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:11,649
Ask her if you can see her
for lunch or a drink tomorrow...

808
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:15,744
and be ready to make light of
the offer if she's unresponsive.

809
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:19,120
This has to be done very
skillfully and diplomatically.

810
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,284
Did you ever read this one?

811
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:25,887
- Don't!
- I'm in love with you.

812
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,726
What are you doing?

813
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:32,259
I'm sorry.
I have to talk to you.

814
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,966
I've been in love
with you for so long.

815
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:39,772
I don't have an interest
in selling it.

816
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:42,245
I ask for something
with puce in it...

817
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,714
you fly off the handle.

818
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,275
I'm not interested in what
your interior decorator thinks.

819
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,753
I can't commit to anything
without consulting her first.

820
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:51,756
That's what I have her for.

821
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,258
This is degrading.
You don't buy paintings...

822
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,055
to blend in with the sofa.

823
00:40:56,094 --> 00:40:59,063
It's not a sofa.
It's an ottoman.

824
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:03,261
God, forget it.
Let's just get out of here.

825
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:06,930
What a weirdo that guy is.
Paranoid.

826
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,037
What's the matter with you?

827
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:11,235
I'll be OK.

828
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:13,744
It's no big deal.
We didn't hit it off.

829
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:15,246
You go on ahead.

830
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,077
Are you OK? You're sweating.

831
00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:20,016
I just need some fresh air.
Something I ate.

832
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:21,519
I'll walk. You go ahead.

833
00:41:21,553 --> 00:41:23,145
You go.

834
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:57,313
There you are.
I was looking for you.

835
00:41:57,355 --> 00:41:59,585
I must apologize.
I'm so mixed up.

836
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:02,491
How do you expect me
to react to such a thing?

837
00:42:02,527 --> 00:42:04,757
I know,
but I'm in love with you.

838
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:06,286
Don't say those words.

839
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:07,798
I'm sorry.
I know it's terrible.

840
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,300
You know the situation.

841
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:10,801
I know. I realize.

842
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,963
What do you expect me to say?

843
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:15,472
Hannah and I
are in the last stages.

844
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:18,476
She's never said anything,
and we're very close.

845
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,674
She's crazy about me,
but somewhere along the line...

846
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:24,409
I've fallen
out of love with her.

847
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:26,246
Not because of me?

848
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:28,149
I love you.

849
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:30,814
I can't be the cause of anything
between you and Hannah.

850
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:32,790
It was inevitable
that Hannah and I part.

851
00:42:32,824 --> 00:42:33,984
Why?

852
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:35,287
For a million reasons.

853
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:36,794
But not over me?

854
00:42:36,828 --> 00:42:39,490
We were both going
in different directions.

855
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,691
Poor Hannah.

856
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:42,996
Do you share
any of my feelings...

857
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:45,195
or is this
an unpleasant embarrassment?

858
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:46,704
I can't say anything.

859
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:49,707
Please be candid.
I don't want you to feel bad.

860
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:52,733
I have certain feelings
for you...

861
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,905
but don't make me
say anything more.

862
00:42:54,946 --> 00:42:58,677
You've said enough.
I'll work things out.

863
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:00,378
Don't do anything on my behalf.

864
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:02,784
I live with Frederick,
and Hannah and I are close.

865
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:04,789
But you care about me?

866
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:07,792
I can't be a party to this.

867
00:43:07,826 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm racked with guilt
just talking to you.

868
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,795
Your guilt is because
you feel the same.

869
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:17,131
Please, I have to go.
I have to get my teeth cleaned.

870
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:22,232
I have my answer.

871
00:43:22,274 --> 00:43:23,866
I'm walking on air.

872
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:43,394
Hi. How's she doing?

873
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:46,397
I'm glad to see you.
She's in the kitchen.

874
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,399
It's the same thing.

875
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:50,526
She promises.
It's all lies.

876
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:52,503
Don't make it worse, Dad.

877
00:43:52,537 --> 00:43:54,505
Hi, Mom. How you doing?

878
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:56,939
Let me get you some coffee.

879
00:43:56,975 --> 00:43:58,442
What triggered it?

880
00:43:58,476 --> 00:44:00,444
We were making a commercial...

881
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:02,878
and there was this young,
good... looking salesman...

882
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:05,348
and your mother was
throwing herself at him...

883
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:06,816
in a disgusting way.

884
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,288
And when she found she
was too old to seduce him...

885
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:12,290
that he was embarrassed by her...

886
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:13,484
Liar!

887
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,983
And at lunch she got
drunker and drunker.

888
00:44:17,028 --> 00:44:19,553
Finally, she became
Joan Collins!

889
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:22,066
All my life, I've had
to put up with insults...

890
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,567
from this nonperson...

891
00:44:23,602 --> 00:44:27,060
this haircut
that passes for a man.

892
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:29,073
He could never support us.

893
00:44:29,107 --> 00:44:32,543
It's a good thing
we had a talented daughter.

894
00:44:32,577 --> 00:44:35,045
I can only hope
that she was mine.

895
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,945
With you as her mother...

896
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:39,416
her father could be anybody
in Actor's Equity!

897
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,113
She's talented,
so it's unlikely she's yours.

898
00:44:42,153 --> 00:44:46,317
Could you stay in the other room
and let me take care of her?

899
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:49,794
You never know when she's
going to fall off the wagon...

900
00:44:49,828 --> 00:44:51,022
and humiliate everybody.

901
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:53,758
Here, Mom. Drink this.

902
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:55,265
You're awful.

903
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,995
You probably were flirting.

904
00:44:57,035 --> 00:45:00,004
I like to joke around
and have fun...

905
00:45:00,038 --> 00:45:02,939
and he gets angry
because I get the attention.

906
00:45:02,974 --> 00:45:05,442
He's gotten sour
as he's gotten older...

907
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:08,412
and I've tried
to stay young at heart.

908
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:10,880
You promised
to stay on the wagon.

909
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,612
The sacrifices I've made
because of that man.

910
00:45:13,652 --> 00:45:16,212
He's ruined me with his ego,
his philandering...

911
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:18,586
his mediocrity.

912
00:45:18,623 --> 00:45:20,818
Stop being so dramatic.

913
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:23,851
He's the one that's laid
every ingnue in stock!

914
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,721
They wanted me
for a screen test...

915
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,030
but I knew that
he'd get up there...

916
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:33,469
and he'd flounder around
with his expensive haircuts...

917
00:45:33,505 --> 00:45:35,700
hairdos, and clothes.

918
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,207
He's all show.

919
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:39,210
Now, how can you act...

920
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:42,236
when there's nothing
inside to come out?

921
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:56,227
She was so beautiful
at one time...

922
00:45:56,261 --> 00:45:58,229
and he was so dashing...

923
00:45:58,263 --> 00:46:01,199
both of them
just full of promise...

924
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:03,497
and hopes that
never materialized.

925
00:46:03,535 --> 00:46:05,298
And the fights...

926
00:46:05,337 --> 00:46:09,239
and the constant infidelities
to prove themselves...

927
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:10,832
and blaming each other.

928
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,342
It's so sad.

929
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:15,039
They loved the idea
of having us kids...

930
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,049
but raising us
didn't interest them much...

931
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:21,052
but it's impossible
to hold it against them.

932
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:23,077
They didn't know anything else.

933
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:25,851
Of all of us in the family...

934
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,859
you were the one blessed
with the true gift.

935
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:31,760
My true gift is luck.

936
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:33,730
From my first show, you know?

937
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:37,701
I always thought Lee was the one
destined for great things.

938
00:46:37,736 --> 00:46:41,194
She's lovely, but she
doesn't have your spark.

939
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,707
She knows it.
She worships you.

940
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:46,404
She wouldn't dare
get up there on stage.

941
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:48,776
Now, Holly's not shy.

942
00:46:48,813 --> 00:46:50,804
Holly's game for anything.

943
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,111
Holly takes after me.

944
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,310
True.

945
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:56,980
I'd have been
a great dope addict.

946
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,512
You remember this, Hannah?

947
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,937
Mr. Saxe, I'm afraid
the news is not good.

948
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:31,213
If I can show you
exactly where the tumor is...

949
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:35,151
and why we feel that surgery
would be of no use.

950
00:48:35,186 --> 00:48:36,813
See...

951
00:48:36,855 --> 00:48:38,049
It's over.

952
00:48:39,757 --> 00:48:43,090
I'm face to face with eternity.

953
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,154
Not later, but now.

954
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:50,964
I'm so frightened, I can't move
or speak or breathe.

955
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:54,738
You're just fine.

956
00:48:54,772 --> 00:48:57,240
There's absolutely
nothing here at all...

957
00:48:57,275 --> 00:48:59,766
and your tests are all fine.

958
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:03,178
I must admit, I was concerned,
given your symptoms.

959
00:49:03,214 --> 00:49:05,944
What caused this hearing loss
in one ear...

960
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,452
I guess we'll never
really know for sure...

961
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:11,455
but whatever it was, it's
certainly not anything serious.

962
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:13,081
I'm very relieved.

963
00:49:29,874 --> 00:49:32,741
What do you mean,
you're quitting?

964
00:49:32,777 --> 00:49:35,245
Why? The news is good.

965
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,679
You don't have cancer...

966
00:49:36,714 --> 00:49:37,942
the thing.

967
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:41,315
Do you realize what a thread
we're all hanging by?

968
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:44,185
You're off the hook.
You should be celebrating.

969
00:49:44,222 --> 00:49:47,191
Can you understand
how meaningless everything is?

970
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,692
Everything,
I'm talking about...

971
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:51,194
our lives, the show,
the whole world.

972
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:53,060
But you're not dying.

973
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:55,065
I'm not dying now...

974
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:57,567
but when I ran
out of the hospital...

975
00:49:57,602 --> 00:49:59,069
I was so thrilled...

976
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:01,071
and I'm running
down the street...

977
00:50:01,105 --> 00:50:02,572
and, suddenly, I stop.

978
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:06,008
It hit me...
so I'm not going to go today...

979
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:09,013
but, eventually, I'm going
to be in that position.

980
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,174
You're just realizing this now?

981
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,184
I don't realize it now.

982
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:17,177
I know it all the time,
but I manage to stick it...

983
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,190
in the back of my mind.

984
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,124
Can I tell you something?

985
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,319
Yes, please.

986
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,828
A week ago, I bought a rifle.

987
00:50:24,862 --> 00:50:27,126
I was going to kill myself.

988
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:29,599
The only thing that
might have stopped me...

989
00:50:29,634 --> 00:50:32,034
is my parents
would be devastated.

990
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,436
I would have to
shoot them also, first...

991
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:35,837
and then my aunt and uncle.

992
00:50:35,873 --> 00:50:37,807
It would have been a bloodbath.

993
00:50:37,842 --> 00:50:41,972
Well, eventually, it is
going to happen to all of us.

994
00:50:42,013 --> 00:50:44,447
Yes, but doesn't that ruin
everything for you?

995
00:50:44,482 --> 00:50:46,950
It just takes the pleasure
out of everything.

996
00:50:46,985 --> 00:50:48,953
You're going to die,
I'm going to die...

997
00:50:48,987 --> 00:50:51,455
the audience, the network,
the sponsor, everybody.

998
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:54,390
I know, and your hamster.

999
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:56,893
Listen, kid,
I think you snapped your cap.

1000
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,386
Maybe you need a few weeks
in Bermuda or something...

1001
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:01,830
or go to a whorehouse.

1002
00:51:01,866 --> 00:51:05,768
I can't stay on the show.
I got to get some answers.

1003
00:51:05,803 --> 00:51:08,363
Otherwise, I'm going
to do something drastic.

1004
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:28,726
I thought you weren't coming.

1005
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,228
I almost didn't.

1006
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,287
I didn't sleep all night.

1007
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,299
No, I'm sure.

1008
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,995
What are we doing
meeting in a hotel room?

1009
00:51:38,036 --> 00:51:39,469
It's terrible, isn't it?

1010
00:51:39,504 --> 00:51:42,473
I couldn't think where to
invite you without taking risks.

1011
00:51:42,507 --> 00:51:44,975
I promised myself
I wouldn't let this happen...

1012
00:51:45,009 --> 00:51:46,476
till you were living alone.

1013
00:51:46,511 --> 00:51:49,002
I was so torn when you called.

1014
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:51,015
I wanted to call you
every day...

1015
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:53,517
since I first
told you how I felt.

1016
00:51:53,551 --> 00:51:55,542
I resisted so many times.

1017
00:51:58,022 --> 00:52:00,013
Don't think badly of me.

1018
00:52:02,493 --> 00:52:04,961
This is not an easy situation.

1019
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,486
I know it isn't.

1020
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:27,145
That was just perfect.

1021
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,676
You've ruined me
for anyone else.

1022
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:33,213
I don't want anyone else
ever to have you.

1023
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:36,556
I was so worried
I wouldn't compare with Hannah.

1024
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:38,061
Oh, my God.

1025
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:40,758
You really do have
those thoughts, don't you?

1026
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:42,823
All the time.

1027
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:45,461
I know she must be
a really passionate person.

1028
00:52:45,503 --> 00:52:47,994
Yes, she's very warm
and giving...

1029
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,338
but it's me that wants
to be giving to you.

1030
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,674
I want to do things for you.

1031
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:56,009
Hannah doesn't need me as much.

1032
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,974
I'm being presumptuous.

1033
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:00,813
Not that you need me.

1034
00:53:00,852 --> 00:53:04,344
I want you to take care of me...

1035
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,790
and I love
when you do things to me.

1036
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:37,782
You're late.

1037
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:39,449
Lucy and I kept talking.

1038
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:42,687
I didn't realize
how late it had gotten.

1039
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:46,686
You missed a very dull TV show
about Auschwitz.

1040
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:48,790
More gruesome film clips...

1041
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:53,065
and more puzzled intellectuals
declaring their mystification...

1042
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,834
over the systematic murder
of millions.

1043
00:53:55,873 --> 00:53:58,364
The reason why they can never
answer the question...

1044
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:02,175
"How could it possibly happen?"
Is that it's the wrong question.

1045
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:04,738
Given what people are,
the question is...

1046
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:06,249
"Why doesn't it
happen more often?"

1047
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,149
Of course, it does,
in subtler forms.

1048
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:11,212
I have a little headache
from this weather.

1049
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:18,425
It's been ages since I sat
in front of the TV...

1050
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,261
just changing channels
to find something.

1051
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,529
You see the whole culture...

1052
00:54:23,568 --> 00:54:24,899
Nazis...

1053
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:26,699
deodorant salesman...

1054
00:54:26,737 --> 00:54:28,364
wrestlers...

1055
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:30,772
beauty contests,
the talk show.

1056
00:54:30,808 --> 00:54:34,744
Can you imagine the level of
a mind that watches wrestling?

1057
00:54:34,779 --> 00:54:38,340
But the worst are
the Fundamentalist preachers...

1058
00:54:38,382 --> 00:54:39,644
third... rate con men...

1059
00:54:39,684 --> 00:54:41,914
telling the poor suckers
that watch them...

1060
00:54:41,953 --> 00:54:43,853
that they speak for Jesus...

1061
00:54:43,888 --> 00:54:47,324
and to please send in money.
Money, money, money.

1062
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,488
If Jesus came back and saw
what's going on in his name...

1063
00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:53,326
he'd never stop throwing up.

1064
00:54:53,364 --> 00:54:56,128
Oh, God, Frederick,
could you please lighten up?

1065
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,691
I'm not in the mood...

1066
00:54:57,735 --> 00:55:00,966
to hear a review
of contemporary society again.

1067
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:03,838
You've been very nervous lately.

1068
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,706
I can't take this anymore.

1069
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:07,711
I'm trying to complete
an education...

1070
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:09,178
I started on you five years ago.

1071
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:11,704
I'm not your pupil.
I was, but I'm not.

1072
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:15,344
When you leave the nest,
I want you to be ready.

1073
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:17,479
We have to make some changes.

1074
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,614
Like what?

1075
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:20,590
You know what.
I'm suffocating.

1076
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:22,752
Are we going to have
this conversation again?

1077
00:55:22,793 --> 00:55:25,057
Yes, we're going to have
this conversation again.

1078
00:55:25,096 --> 00:55:27,724
I have to leave.
I have to move out.

1079
00:55:27,765 --> 00:55:30,233
- Why?
- Because I have to.

1080
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:32,361
What are you going
to use for money?

1081
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:35,998
I thought maybe I'd move in
with my parents for a while.

1082
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,907
I always told you
you would leave me.

1083
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:40,877
Does it have to be now?

1084
00:55:40,912 --> 00:55:44,541
Maybe it will only be temporary,
but I have to try.

1085
00:55:46,317 --> 00:55:47,909
You're my whole world.

1086
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:54,555
Good God.
Have you been kissed tonight?

1087
00:55:55,693 --> 00:55:58,161
Yes, you have.
You've been with someone!

1088
00:55:58,195 --> 00:56:00,060
Stop accusing me!

1089
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:02,588
I'm too smart, Lee.
You can't fool me!

1090
00:56:02,633 --> 00:56:04,658
- You're turning red!
- Leave me alone!

1091
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:07,193
Oh, Christ!
What's wrong with you?

1092
00:56:09,774 --> 00:56:11,002
I'm sorry.

1093
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:12,805
Why couldn't you say something?

1094
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:15,038
You have to slither around
behind my back.

1095
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:16,546
I'm saying it now!

1096
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,277
So you met somebody else?

1097
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:23,453
You knew it was going to happen
sooner or later.

1098
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:24,920
I can't live like this.

1099
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:26,423
Who is it?

1100
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:27,947
Just somebody I met.

1101
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:29,857
Who? Where did you meet him?

1102
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:32,761
It doesn't matter.
I have to move out.

1103
00:56:32,797 --> 00:56:35,357
You're my only connection
to the world.

1104
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,367
That's too much responsibility
for me.

1105
00:56:37,401 --> 00:56:41,667
It's not fair.
I want a less complicated life.

1106
00:56:41,706 --> 00:56:44,504
I want a husband, maybe a child,
before it's too late.

1107
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,772
Jesus. Jesus.

1108
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:50,076
Oh, God.
I don't even know what I want.

1109
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:56,776
What do you get out of me,
anyway? I mean...

1110
00:56:56,821 --> 00:57:00,552
It's not sexual anymore.

1111
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:02,115
It's certainly not intellectual.

1112
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:04,787
You're so superior to me
in every way.

1113
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:06,490
Don't patronize me!

1114
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:13,662
God! I should have married you
years ago when you wanted to.

1115
00:57:13,704 --> 00:57:15,069
I should have agreed.

1116
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:19,372
Don't you know
it never would have worked?

1117
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,537
I told you one day
you would leave me...

1118
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:23,376
for a younger man. I...

1119
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:37,090
What passion today with Lee.

1120
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:39,119
She's a volcano.

1121
00:57:39,163 --> 00:57:41,927
It was a totally
fulfilling experience...

1122
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:44,127
just as I'd dreamed it would be.

1123
00:57:44,168 --> 00:57:45,635
That's what it was.

1124
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,128
It was like living out a dream,
a great dream.

1125
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:53,633
Now I feel very good and cozy
being here next to Hannah.

1126
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,442
There's something very lovely
and real about Hannah.

1127
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,974
She gives me a very deep feeling
of being part of something.

1128
00:58:01,018 --> 00:58:05,216
She's a wonderful woman,
and I betrayed her.

1129
00:58:05,256 --> 00:58:07,918
She came into my empty life
and changed it...

1130
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:11,860
and I paid her back by banging
her sister in a hotel room.

1131
00:58:11,896 --> 00:58:13,420
God, I'm despicable.

1132
00:58:13,464 --> 00:58:15,898
What a cruel
and shallow thing to do.

1133
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:18,697
I have to call her and tell her
what we did was crazy.

1134
00:58:18,736 --> 00:58:21,204
It can't ever happen again.
I'm not that kind of man.

1135
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:22,967
I value Hannah too much.

1136
00:58:23,007 --> 00:58:25,669
I love my wife.
Now I betrayed her.

1137
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,972
Oh, God.

1138
00:58:27,011 --> 00:58:28,410
Where are you going?

1139
00:58:28,446 --> 00:58:32,906
I've got to get a phone number.
I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

1140
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,417
- Lt's so late.
- I know.

1141
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:35,919
I can't believe I forgot.

1142
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:38,285
What if he answers?

1143
00:58:38,322 --> 00:58:39,789
I'll hang up.

1144
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:41,451
I'll tell her
we can't communicate...

1145
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:43,289
until I terminate my marriage...

1146
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,294
it's immoral.

1147
00:58:44,328 --> 00:58:45,795
Then time will pass...

1148
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,458
I won't call,
and she'll get the idea.

1149
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:51,957
I've got to stop this
before I get in too deep.

1150
00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:55,301
I'd rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

1151
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:56,863
It's 1:30.

1152
00:58:56,907 --> 00:59:00,866
She can't have a conversation
with me with him around.

1153
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:02,845
I'm getting hysterical.

1154
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,440
I'll call her first thing
in the morning.

1155
00:59:05,483 --> 00:59:07,212
I'll call her at 6:00.

1156
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:09,811
Frederick goes jogging at 6:00.

1157
00:59:09,854 --> 00:59:12,482
She'll be alone.
I'll call her.

1158
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:15,685
I've got it! I've got it!
I've got it!

1159
00:59:18,028 --> 00:59:19,791
Mel!

1160
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,764
I would have hung up
if you hadn't answered.

1161
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:25,496
I won't do this again,
but I had to tell you...

1162
00:59:25,536 --> 00:59:29,734
I feel very close to you
tonight, very, very close.

1163
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:30,968
Good night.

1164
00:59:45,156 --> 00:59:49,149
Millions of books written
on every conceivable subject...

1165
00:59:49,193 --> 00:59:50,990
by all these great minds...

1166
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:53,997
and in the end, none of them
knows anything more...

1167
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:57,125
about the big questions
of life than I do.

1168
00:59:57,168 --> 00:59:59,159
I read Socrates.

1169
00:59:59,203 --> 01:00:02,400
This guy used to knock off
little Greek boys.

1170
01:00:02,439 --> 01:00:05,169
What the hell's
he got to teach me?

1171
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:08,542
And Nietzsche, with his theory
of eternal recurrence.

1172
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,672
He said that
the life we live...

1173
01:00:10,714 --> 01:00:12,909
we're going to live
over and over again...

1174
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,009
the exact same way
for eternity.

1175
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:17,543
Great. That means I'll have
to sit through...

1176
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:19,215
the Ice Capades again.

1177
01:00:19,256 --> 01:00:21,019
It's not worth it.

1178
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:23,652
And Freud,
another great pessimist.

1179
01:00:23,694 --> 01:00:27,221
I was in analysis for years.
Nothing happened.

1180
01:00:27,264 --> 01:00:29,664
My poor analyst
got so frustrated...

1181
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,669
the guy finally put in
a salad bar.

1182
01:00:32,703 --> 01:00:34,671
Look at all these
people jogging...

1183
01:00:34,705 --> 01:00:36,104
trying to stave off...

1184
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,665
the inevitable decay
of the body.

1185
01:00:38,709 --> 01:00:41,337
Boy, it's so sad
what people go through...

1186
01:00:41,378 --> 01:00:44,643
with their stationary bike
and their exercise and their...

1187
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,547
Oh, look at this one.

1188
01:00:46,584 --> 01:00:47,881
Poor thing.

1189
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:51,376
My God, she has to tote
all that fat around.

1190
01:00:51,422 --> 01:00:53,890
She should pull it on a dolly.

1191
01:00:53,924 --> 01:00:57,382
Maybe the poets are right.
Maybe love is the only answer.

1192
01:00:57,428 --> 01:01:00,886
I was in love with Hannah.
That didn't work out.

1193
01:01:00,931 --> 01:01:03,399
I even took her sister out.
Remember that?

1194
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:06,403
Remember years ago when
Hannah and I got divorced...

1195
01:01:06,437 --> 01:01:09,235
and she fixed me up
with her sister Holly?

1196
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:13,604
I want to be like you

1197
01:01:13,644 --> 01:01:16,306
I'm gonna fit to your groove

1198
01:01:17,648 --> 01:01:19,275
I don't want to be different

1199
01:01:19,316 --> 01:01:23,150
So I'm gonna be just like you

1200
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:24,814
'Cause I go buy records

1201
01:01:24,855 --> 01:01:27,289
That they play on the radio

1202
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:30,450
I'm gonna dance that club

1203
01:01:30,494 --> 01:01:33,952
Gonna do just what I'm told

1204
01:01:33,998 --> 01:01:37,229
I'm pleadin'...

1205
01:01:37,268 --> 01:01:39,736
Why are you making those faces?

1206
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,261
I can't hear you.
I can't hear anything.

1207
01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:44,774
I'm going to lose hearing
in my ear.

1208
01:01:44,808 --> 01:01:46,275
Listen,
you're witnessing genius.

1209
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,835
My ears are experiencing
a meltdown.

1210
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,346
I can't hear anything.

1211
01:01:50,381 --> 01:01:53,350
Can't you feel the energy?
A tangible energy.

1212
01:01:53,384 --> 01:01:55,443
The room's alive
with positive vibrations.

1213
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:56,953
Holly, I'm frightened.

1214
01:01:56,987 --> 01:01:59,455
After their set,
they're going to take hostages.

1215
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,288
Let's... Don't... No, please.
You... No.

1216
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:04,294
You want some? Come on, Mickey.

1217
01:02:04,328 --> 01:02:06,296
You've been doing that
all night.

1218
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,322
You're going to develop
a third nostril.

1219
01:02:09,366 --> 01:02:10,663
Don't. Please.

1220
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:12,259
Can we go?

1221
01:02:13,537 --> 01:02:15,505
'Cause I go buy records

1222
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:18,235
That they play on the radio

1223
01:02:18,275 --> 01:02:21,108
I love songs about
extraterrestrial life...

1224
01:02:21,145 --> 01:02:22,271
don't you?

1225
01:02:22,313 --> 01:02:24,508
Not when they're sung
by extraterrestrials.

1226
01:02:24,548 --> 01:02:26,015
I cannot communicate with you.

1227
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:28,951
I never realized
you were such a tight... ass.

1228
01:02:28,986 --> 01:02:31,454
Your sisters have such
good taste in music.

1229
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:33,456
I don't know where
you went wrong.

1230
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,787
I'm my own person.

1231
01:02:34,825 --> 01:02:37,316
Can I take you to hear
something nice?

1232
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:38,828
Mickey, it's getting late.

1233
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:40,329
Because you're being angry.

1234
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:43,333
I'm not angry, but you
don't believe in E.S. P...

1235
01:02:43,367 --> 01:02:45,335
you don't like rock music,
you won't get high.

1236
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:47,337
It's like I'm dating
Cardinal Cook.

1237
01:02:53,377 --> 01:02:56,175
Why am I

1238
01:02:56,213 --> 01:02:59,671
Just as reckless as a child?

1239
01:02:59,717 --> 01:03:02,447
Why am I

1240
01:03:02,486 --> 01:03:06,047
Like a racehorse runnin' wild?

1241
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,786
Why am I

1242
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:12,728
In a state of ecstasy?

1243
01:03:12,763 --> 01:03:17,200
The reason is 'cause
something's happened to me

1244
01:03:17,234 --> 01:03:20,533
I'm in love again

1245
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:23,768
And the spring is comin'

1246
01:03:23,807 --> 01:03:25,468
I'm in love again

1247
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:29,544
Hear my heartstrings strummin'

1248
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,140
I'm in love again

1249
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:35,447
And the hymn they're hummin'

1250
01:03:35,486 --> 01:03:37,852
Is those cuddle... up

1251
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:40,857
Huddle... up blues

1252
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:44,019
I'm in love again

1253
01:03:44,061 --> 01:03:47,588
And I can't rise above it

1254
01:03:47,631 --> 01:03:49,895
I'm in love again

1255
01:03:49,933 --> 01:03:53,425
And I love, love, love it

1256
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,267
Thanks for a swell time.

1257
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:58,763
You didn't have to talk
while the guy was singing.

1258
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:00,208
I was so bored.

1259
01:04:00,244 --> 01:04:01,802
You don't deserve Cole Porter.

1260
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:03,210
You should stay
with those groups...

1261
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:05,511
that look like they're going
to stab their mothers.

1262
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:06,914
I'm open to new concepts.

1263
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,544
You don't have to snort cocaine
all the time.

1264
01:04:09,586 --> 01:04:11,781
Do you carry a kilo
in your purse?

1265
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:14,120
This crowd wouldn't know the
difference. They're embalmed.

1266
01:04:14,158 --> 01:04:16,524
I'm glad Hannah got us together.

1267
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,393
She's got a great instinct
for people, really.

1268
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,830
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
It's probably my fault.

1269
01:04:21,865 --> 01:04:23,833
I've been a little depressed
lately.

1270
01:04:23,867 --> 01:04:25,334
I had a great time.

1271
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:27,337
It was like
the Nuremberg Trials.

1272
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:28,804
I'll see myself home!

1273
01:04:31,308 --> 01:04:33,776
Yep, it was quite an evening.

1274
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:35,642
Holly with her cocaine.

1275
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,979
She should've been wearing
a gold shovel around her neck.

1276
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:43,817
She was polymorphously
insensitive, I think.

1277
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:45,321
Too bad, too...

1278
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:49,849
'cause, you know, I always
had a little crush on her.

1279
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,428
You have to read
the instructions.

1280
01:05:25,462 --> 01:05:27,453
You set one of these things...

1281
01:05:27,498 --> 01:05:29,398
and you can take
pictures underwater.

1282
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:33,927
When we get to the country,
we'll try it in the lake, OK?

1283
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,977
Are you in a bad mood?

1284
01:05:46,016 --> 01:05:48,849
I don't know.
I'm just antsy.

1285
01:05:48,886 --> 01:05:52,344
I know. The last few weeks,
you haven't been yourself.

1286
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:55,381
Tonight at dinner,
you were curt with me.

1287
01:05:55,425 --> 01:05:57,757
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.

1288
01:05:57,794 --> 01:06:00,854
When I brought up the idea
of having a baby...

1289
01:06:00,898 --> 01:06:02,388
you jumped down my throat.

1290
01:06:02,432 --> 01:06:04,900
I don't think
it's a very good idea.

1291
01:06:04,935 --> 01:06:05,902
Why not?

1292
01:06:05,936 --> 01:06:08,427
It's the last thing
we need right now.

1293
01:06:08,472 --> 01:06:11,441
Why do you say that?
Is there something wrong?

1294
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:12,942
I don't know.

1295
01:06:12,976 --> 01:06:14,500
Should I be worried?

1296
01:06:14,545 --> 01:06:16,513
Well, you got four children.

1297
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:18,674
I want one with you.

1298
01:06:18,715 --> 01:06:22,947
I think we should wait
till things settle.

1299
01:06:22,986 --> 01:06:25,386
What does that mean?

1300
01:06:25,422 --> 01:06:26,889
We've been married four years.

1301
01:06:26,924 --> 01:06:28,824
How settled can things get?

1302
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,827
You have some very set plans...

1303
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,193
on how your life
should be structured...

1304
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:36,631
a house, kids, certain school,
a home in Connecticut.

1305
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:39,227
It's all very preconceived.

1306
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:42,727
Yeah, but l...
I thought you needed that.

1307
01:06:42,773 --> 01:06:45,742
When we met,
you said your life was chaos.

1308
01:06:45,776 --> 01:06:48,745
But there's got to be
some give and take.

1309
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:52,476
Listen, I don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

1310
01:06:52,516 --> 01:06:54,507
Are you angry with me?

1311
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:59,148
Are you disenchanted
with our marriage?

1312
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:00,486
I didn't say that.

1313
01:07:00,524 --> 01:07:02,253
Are you in love
with someone else?

1314
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:05,159
What is this, the Gestapo? No.

1315
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:07,663
Well, what?
What are you not telling me?

1316
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:08,995
What kind of interrogation...

1317
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:11,660
Supposing I said yes,
I am disenchanted.

1318
01:07:11,702 --> 01:07:14,136
- I am in love with someone else.
- Are you?

1319
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,507
But you keep asking
these awful questions.

1320
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:21,204
It's like you want me
to say yes.

1321
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:22,872
What are you talking about?

1322
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:25,040
Of course not.
I'd be destroyed.

1323
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:27,744
For Christ's sake,
stop torturing her.

1324
01:07:27,784 --> 01:07:31,242
Tell her you want out
and get it over with.

1325
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:33,256
You're in love with her sister.

1326
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,258
You didn't do it on purpose.

1327
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:38,261
Be honest.
It's always the best way.

1328
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:40,786
Can I help you?

1329
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:42,799
If you're suffering
over something...

1330
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,801
will you share it with me?

1331
01:07:46,603 --> 01:07:49,629
You know how much I love you.

1332
01:07:50,807 --> 01:07:53,275
I ought to have
my head examined.

1333
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,800
I don't deserve you.

1334
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:03,986
I want to look good...

1335
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:07,149
but I don't want to feel
like I'm overdressed.

1336
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:08,555
How about this?

1337
01:08:08,592 --> 01:08:11,789
I really like that.
That's a pretty color on you.

1338
01:08:11,828 --> 01:08:13,796
Ever think
you'd be helping me...

1339
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:16,321
find something
to wear to the opera?

1340
01:08:16,366 --> 01:08:18,834
It's great.
I can't wait to meet him.

1341
01:08:18,869 --> 01:08:19,836
He's married.

1342
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,338
His wife's in and out
of institutions.

1343
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:23,532
She's schizophrenic.

1344
01:08:23,573 --> 01:08:25,541
Sometimes she's terrific,
then she just breaks down.

1345
01:08:25,575 --> 01:08:27,042
He has this sweet daughter.

1346
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:29,477
When she goes to college
next year...

1347
01:08:29,513 --> 01:08:30,980
he's going to split permanently.

1348
01:08:31,014 --> 01:08:32,276
He's paid his dues...

1349
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,784
but she helped put him
through architecture school.

1350
01:08:34,818 --> 01:08:37,286
You found all this out
on one date?

1351
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:40,290
I think he was dying to open up.
It's so sad.

1352
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,384
What should I wear
to my audition?

1353
01:08:43,427 --> 01:08:46,328
I've got a singing audition
for a Broadway musical.

1354
01:08:46,363 --> 01:08:47,830
I'll never get it.

1355
01:08:47,864 --> 01:08:49,798
- Singing?
- Can you believe it?

1356
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:52,825
- Really?
- Well, I mean, why not?

1357
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:54,837
What have I got to lose?

1358
01:08:54,871 --> 01:08:59,331
No, I just...
No, I didn't know you sang.

1359
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:02,345
Why, you think everybody
in musicals sings so well?

1360
01:09:02,379 --> 01:09:06,076
It's just that they sing.

1361
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:08,175
Well, you know.

1362
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:12,345
I sing a little.
I mean, you know.

1363
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:14,949
I know. No, I know.

1364
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:17,050
I mean, don't say it that way.

1365
01:09:17,094 --> 01:09:19,562
My confidence
is not my strong point.

1366
01:09:19,596 --> 01:09:21,063
I didn't mean that.

1367
01:09:21,098 --> 01:09:24,465
I think I can fake my way
through a song, easily.

1368
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,970
Why?
You don't think it's realistic?

1369
01:09:29,005 --> 01:09:30,836
No, I didn't... No.

1370
01:09:30,874 --> 01:09:34,833
I just hate to see you
put yourself in a position...

1371
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:36,345
where you get hurt.

1372
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,349
You know how you take
every single rejection...

1373
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:42,875
as confirmation
that you have no talent.

1374
01:09:42,919 --> 01:09:44,386
Well, maybe I'll get it.

1375
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:45,820
I hope.

1376
01:09:45,856 --> 01:09:49,053
Boy, you really know
how to cut me down.

1377
01:09:49,092 --> 01:09:51,060
What? Don't be so sensitive.

1378
01:09:51,094 --> 01:09:52,561
Can't I say anything?

1379
01:09:52,596 --> 01:09:56,054
I sing. For Christ's sake,
you heard me sing!

1380
01:09:56,099 --> 01:09:58,397
OK l... What happened?

1381
01:09:58,435 --> 01:10:00,903
We were having
a really nice time...

1382
01:10:00,937 --> 01:10:03,906
and suddenly everything
went to bad feeling.

1383
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,966
Nobody but you can do that
to me. I don't know why.

1384
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,672
Look,
everything's going your way.

1385
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:12,778
You're right.

1386
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:14,283
I'm happy.

1387
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:19,979
Why must I let my insecurities
spoil everything?

1388
01:10:20,023 --> 01:10:23,857
Yes, his fancies

1389
01:10:23,894 --> 01:10:27,660
Are passing fancies

1390
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:31,724
But sighing sighs,
holding hands

1391
01:10:31,768 --> 01:10:36,762
This my heart understands

1392
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:40,265
I'm old... fashioned

1393
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:44,110
And I don't mind it

1394
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:48,277
It's how I want to be

1395
01:10:48,318 --> 01:10:53,255
As long as you agree

1396
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:58,990
To stay old... fashioned

1397
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:03,022
With me

1398
01:11:03,066 --> 01:11:04,556
Thank you very much.

1399
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:06,501
- Thank you.
- Terrific.

1400
01:11:07,904 --> 01:11:09,769
April Knox.

1401
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,478
Someday

1402
01:11:19,516 --> 01:11:22,644
When I'm awfully low

1403
01:11:22,686 --> 01:11:26,178
When the world is cold

1404
01:11:26,223 --> 01:11:28,248
I will get a glow

1405
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:32,523
Just thinking of you

1406
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:35,861
And the way you look

1407
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:39,426
Tonight

1408
01:11:39,469 --> 01:11:42,802
You sounded great.
You may be surprised.

1409
01:11:42,839 --> 01:11:44,534
I'm glad we have a catering job
this week.

1410
01:11:44,574 --> 01:11:46,872
I'm real low on money.

1411
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:50,311
We have Mr. Levine's 80th
birthday on Riverside Drive.

1412
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:53,475
Or Riverside Memorial Chapel,
depending on his health.

1413
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:55,985
Listen. David called me up.

1414
01:11:56,019 --> 01:11:56,986
What?

1415
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,988
David called me last night.

1416
01:11:59,022 --> 01:12:01,513
He wants to take me
to the opera.

1417
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:03,526
I didn't know what to say.

1418
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,891
You're joking.

1419
01:12:04,928 --> 01:12:07,419
No, he called late last night.

1420
01:12:08,665 --> 01:12:11,133
I'm very surprised.

1421
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:14,136
He wants to take me
to see "Rigoletto."

1422
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,035
And you're going.

1423
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:18,040
I didn't know what to say.

1424
01:12:18,074 --> 01:12:20,008
First I said no,
then he pressed it.

1425
01:12:20,043 --> 01:12:21,601
He said he'd taken you once...

1426
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:23,977
and he really wanted
to invite me.

1427
01:12:25,415 --> 01:12:26,882
But I'm seeing him.

1428
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:28,179
I know. I said that...

1429
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:31,949
but he said it was something
he really felt like doing.

1430
01:12:34,824 --> 01:12:38,282
I don't know what to say.

1431
01:12:38,328 --> 01:12:40,319
It's just an evening
at the opera.

1432
01:12:40,363 --> 01:12:42,923
Did I do wrong in accepting?

1433
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:54,867
Why do you think that you would
like to convert to Catholicism?

1434
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:57,402
I've got to have something
to believe in...

1435
01:12:57,447 --> 01:12:59,244
otherwise life
is just meaningless.

1436
01:12:59,282 --> 01:13:01,750
But why did you make
the decision...

1437
01:13:01,785 --> 01:13:04,549
to choose the Catholic faith?

1438
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,751
First of all, because it's
a very beautiful religion...

1439
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:10,817
and it's a strong religion.
It's very well... structured.

1440
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,418
I'm talking now, incidentally...

1441
01:13:12,462 --> 01:13:15,431
about the against school prayer,
pro... abortion, antinuclear wing.

1442
01:13:15,465 --> 01:13:17,729
At the moment
you don't believe in God?

1443
01:13:17,767 --> 01:13:19,359
No, and I want to.

1444
01:13:19,402 --> 01:13:20,994
I'm willing to do anything.

1445
01:13:21,037 --> 01:13:22,732
I'll dye Easter eggs
if it works.

1446
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:25,764
I need some evidence.
I got to have proof.

1447
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:29,575
If I can't believe in God,
then life isn't worth living.

1448
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:32,081
It means making a very big leap.

1449
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:33,844
Well, can you help me?

1450
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,586
I don't understand.

1451
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,589
I thought you'd be happy.

1452
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,090
How can we be happy?

1453
01:13:41,124 --> 01:13:42,785
I never thought of God
in my life.

1454
01:13:42,826 --> 01:13:44,589
Now I'm giving it
serious thought.

1455
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,596
Catholicism?
Why not your own people?

1456
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,599
I got off on the wrong foot
with that.

1457
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,033
I need a dramatic change
in my life.

1458
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:53,729
You're going to believe
in Jesus Christ?

1459
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:56,136
I know it sounds funny,
but I'm going to try.

1460
01:13:56,172 --> 01:13:58,003
But why?
We raised you as a Jew.

1461
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,372
Just because I was born
that way...

1462
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:01,468
I'm old enough
to make a mature decision.

1463
01:14:01,511 --> 01:14:02,808
But why Jesus Christ?

1464
01:14:02,846 --> 01:14:05,144
Why, for instance,
shouldn't you become a Buddhist?

1465
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:06,808
That's totally alien to me.

1466
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,317
You're getting on in years.

1467
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:09,648
Aren't you afraid of dying?

1468
01:14:09,686 --> 01:14:11,153
Why should I be afraid?

1469
01:14:11,187 --> 01:14:12,814
- 'Cause you won't exist.
- So?

1470
01:14:12,856 --> 01:14:14,551
That thought
doesn't terrify you?

1471
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:17,424
Who thinks about such nonsense?
When I'm dead, I'll be dead.

1472
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,360
I don't understand.
Aren't you frightened?

1473
01:14:19,396 --> 01:14:21,159
Of what? I'll be unconscious.

1474
01:14:21,197 --> 01:14:22,858
But never to exist again?

1475
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:24,366
How do you know?

1476
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:25,868
It certainly doesn't
look promising.

1477
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:27,537
Who knows what will be?

1478
01:14:27,537 --> 01:14:29,971
I'll either be unconscious,
or I won't.

1479
01:14:30,006 --> 01:14:33,965
If not, I'll deal with it then.
I'm not going to worry now.

1480
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,477
Mom, come out.

1481
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,980
Of course there's a god,
you idiot.

1482
01:14:38,014 --> 01:14:39,481
You don't believe in God?

1483
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:42,974
Then why is there so much evil
in the world?

1484
01:14:43,019 --> 01:14:45,487
On a simplistic level,
why were there Nazis?

1485
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:46,989
Tell him, Max.

1486
01:14:47,023 --> 01:14:48,991
How the hell do I know?

1487
01:14:49,025 --> 01:14:51,425
I don't know
how the can opener works.

1488
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:16,806
Hi. Where's Holly?

1489
01:16:16,846 --> 01:16:18,814
She's auditioning
for a television commercial.

1490
01:16:18,848 --> 01:16:20,315
She said she'll be late.

1491
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,817
How is she doing?

1492
01:16:21,851 --> 01:16:24,513
You know Holly when
she's depressed. She's manic.

1493
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:27,216
It was a good idea
we invited her to lunch.

1494
01:16:27,257 --> 01:16:29,157
I hope you told her
it was your idea.

1495
01:16:29,192 --> 01:16:32,457
When I try to help,
she gets defensive.

1496
01:16:32,495 --> 01:16:35,157
She's just embarrassed
in front of you.

1497
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:36,665
So how are you?

1498
01:16:36,699 --> 01:16:37,666
I'm OK.

1499
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,065
Do you miss Frederick?

1500
01:16:39,102 --> 01:16:40,763
I can't believe Elliot and I...

1501
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:43,932
can't think of someone for you
to go out with.

1502
01:16:43,973 --> 01:16:46,533
Are you doing OK?
How's Frederick... Elliot?

1503
01:16:46,576 --> 01:16:48,806
He's fine.
I guess he's fine.

1504
01:16:48,845 --> 01:16:50,813
He's been kind of moody lately.

1505
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:53,315
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

1506
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:55,283
He's kind of distant, difficult.

1507
01:16:55,318 --> 01:16:58,446
I've been trying to talk to him.
He says everything's fine.

1508
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:01,116
Automatically,
I leap to the worst conclusion...

1509
01:17:01,157 --> 01:17:02,818
he's seeing someone else.

1510
01:17:02,859 --> 01:17:04,986
No, everyone thinks
things like that.

1511
01:17:05,028 --> 01:17:08,020
I just came from an audition
which I did not get.

1512
01:17:08,064 --> 01:17:09,497
So what's new?

1513
01:17:09,532 --> 01:17:12,023
They said I was
too offbeat... looking...

1514
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:13,695
whatever the hell that means.

1515
01:17:13,736 --> 01:17:15,533
But guess who's there
auditioning?

1516
01:17:15,572 --> 01:17:16,766
April?

1517
01:17:16,806 --> 01:17:19,036
You got it.
I was very polite.

1518
01:17:19,075 --> 01:17:21,543
I maintained my poise.
I said hello.

1519
01:17:21,578 --> 01:17:23,045
I never trusted April.

1520
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:25,570
She has eyes
in the back of her head.

1521
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:28,641
She and an architect
are now a very definite item...

1522
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:30,585
which I still cannot believe.

1523
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,848
Although it's put an end...

1524
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:33,583
to the Stanislavski
Catering Company.

1525
01:17:33,623 --> 01:17:35,682
Which is why I have
to speak to you.

1526
01:17:35,725 --> 01:17:39,126
You'll get impatient, but...
I have to borrow more money.

1527
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:40,254
That's fine.

1528
01:17:40,296 --> 01:17:42,764
What I decided to do
is some writing.

1529
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:44,426
I've had it with acting.

1530
01:17:44,467 --> 01:17:47,095
These meaningless auditions
are cattle calls.

1531
01:17:47,136 --> 01:17:49,104
I can't handle
another rejection.

1532
01:17:49,138 --> 01:17:50,605
Let's face it here.

1533
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,098
I've got to latch on
to something in my life...

1534
01:17:54,143 --> 01:17:57,169
something with a future.
I'm not sixteen anymore.

1535
01:17:57,213 --> 01:17:59,272
It's just crazy...

1536
01:17:59,315 --> 01:18:04,275
but I've got an idea
for a story, more than one...

1537
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,154
and I just need a few months
or a year even.

1538
01:18:08,191 --> 01:18:12,150
I picked up a lot of dramatic
structure from acting class.

1539
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:17,326
That's good. It just seems to me
that six months or a year...

1540
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:19,995
if you spend it
more productively...

1541
01:18:20,036 --> 01:18:21,162
Like what?

1542
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:22,671
Well, I don't know.

1543
01:18:22,705 --> 01:18:25,173
Didn't Mom mention
there was something...

1544
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:27,472
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

1545
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,636
That's clerical.

1546
01:18:28,678 --> 01:18:32,409
No, didn't she say it was
in the publicity department?

1547
01:18:32,448 --> 01:18:34,416
That can lead to other things.

1548
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:35,940
I knew you'd be discouraging.

1549
01:18:35,985 --> 01:18:38,112
I'm trying to be helpful.

1550
01:18:38,154 --> 01:18:40,122
A person doesn't say one day...

1551
01:18:40,156 --> 01:18:43,284
"I'm finished as an actress.
Now I'm a writer."

1552
01:18:43,326 --> 01:18:46,386
- You mean not at my age.
- Please. We came to have lunch.

1553
01:18:46,429 --> 01:18:48,863
Right. Forget it.

1554
01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:50,866
I just want a salad.

1555
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,868
You really think I'm a loser.

1556
01:18:52,902 --> 01:18:54,369
You're being ridiculous.

1557
01:18:54,404 --> 01:18:55,871
You are, Holly. Stop it.

1558
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:58,373
- You treat me like a loser.
- How?

1559
01:18:58,408 --> 01:19:00,467
You never have faith
in my plans.

1560
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:01,772
You always undercut
my enthusiasm.

1561
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:04,211
Not so.
I've been very supportive.

1562
01:19:04,247 --> 01:19:07,182
I try to give you honest,
constructive advice.

1563
01:19:07,216 --> 01:19:09,411
I'm always happy
to help you financially.

1564
01:19:09,452 --> 01:19:10,851
I've gone out of my way...

1565
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:14,050
to introduce you
to interesting single men.

1566
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,921
- All losers.
- You're too demanding.

1567
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:17,517
I could tell
what you thought of me...

1568
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,289
by the men
you fixed me up with.

1569
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:20,660
That's not true.

1570
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:21,994
I know I'm mediocre.

1571
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:23,498
Stop attacking Hannah.

1572
01:19:23,533 --> 01:19:25,228
She's going through
a rough time.

1573
01:19:25,268 --> 01:19:26,758
Why are you so upset?

1574
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:29,203
You've been picking on her
since she came here.

1575
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:32,002
Leave her alone.
I'm suffocating.

1576
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:35,010
Why are you so sensitive
all of a sudden?

1577
01:19:35,044 --> 01:19:37,012
You want to write, write.

1578
01:19:37,046 --> 01:19:39,514
Let's just not talk
about it anymore.

1579
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:43,508
Take a year. Take six months,
whatever you want.

1580
01:19:43,553 --> 01:19:47,011
Who knows? Maybe you'll be
sitting with a good play.

1581
01:19:47,056 --> 01:19:48,523
What's the matter?

1582
01:19:48,558 --> 01:19:50,856
You look pale. Are you OK?

1583
01:19:50,893 --> 01:19:55,523
Yeah. You know, I just got
dizzy all of a sudden.

1584
01:19:55,565 --> 01:19:58,659
I think we need to eat.

1585
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,819
I can't seem to take action.

1586
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:20,414
I'm like Hamlet
unable to kill his uncle.

1587
01:20:20,456 --> 01:20:23,914
I want Lee,
but I can't harm Hannah...

1588
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,452
and in no other area
am I a procrastinator.

1589
01:20:29,132 --> 01:20:31,794
Meanwhile,
Lee has no direction.

1590
01:20:31,834 --> 01:20:35,292
She's taking courses
at Columbia, but just randomly.

1591
01:20:35,338 --> 01:20:37,306
I try not to call her...

1592
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,798
but then she calls me,
and then I call...

1593
01:20:40,843 --> 01:20:45,303
and we try to resist meeting,
but once in a while we meet.

1594
01:20:45,348 --> 01:20:49,307
Sometimes we argue because
I can't break up my marriage.

1595
01:20:49,352 --> 01:20:51,320
Sometimes we wind up
making love...

1596
01:20:51,354 --> 01:20:54,152
and we both feel terrible.

1597
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:55,680
But it's my fault.

1598
01:20:57,393 --> 01:20:59,452
For all my education...

1599
01:20:59,495 --> 01:21:02,293
accomplishments,
and so... called wisdom...

1600
01:21:02,331 --> 01:21:05,698
I can't fathom my own heart.

1601
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:09,466
Krishna, Krishna,
Hare, Hare...

1602
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:12,474
What makes you interested
in becoming a Hare Krishna?

1603
01:21:12,508 --> 01:21:14,976
I'm not saying
that I want to join...

1604
01:21:15,011 --> 01:21:17,479
but I know you guys
believe in reincarnation...

1605
01:21:17,513 --> 01:21:18,980
so it interests me.

1606
01:21:19,015 --> 01:21:20,209
What's your religion?

1607
01:21:20,249 --> 01:21:21,546
I was born Jewish...

1608
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:24,280
but last winter
I tried to become a Catholic.

1609
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,685
It didn't work for me.

1610
01:21:25,721 --> 01:21:29,555
I studied and tried,
but Catholicism for me was...

1611
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:31,287
"Die now, pay later."

1612
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:33,795
I couldn't get with it.
I wanted to.

1613
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,092
You're afraid of dying?

1614
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:36,359
Yeah, naturally. Aren't you?

1615
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,095
In reincarnation,
does that mean my soul...

1616
01:21:39,135 --> 01:21:41,000
would pass
to another human being...

1617
01:21:41,037 --> 01:21:44,063
or would I come back as
a moose or an aardvark?

1618
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,940
Take our literature,
read it over...

1619
01:21:46,976 --> 01:21:48,500
and think about it.

1620
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,841
Thank you very much.

1621
01:21:49,879 --> 01:21:51,847
You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

1622
01:21:55,318 --> 01:21:58,378
Who are you kidding?
You're going to be a Krishna?

1623
01:21:58,421 --> 01:22:01,015
You're going to
shave your head, put on robes...

1624
01:22:01,057 --> 01:22:02,786
and dance around at airports?

1625
01:22:02,825 --> 01:22:04,793
You'd look like Jerry Lewis.

1626
01:22:04,827 --> 01:22:07,625
Oh, God, I'm so depressed.

1627
01:22:17,406 --> 01:22:20,603
The nights
are really getting cooler.

1628
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:22,941
Summer went so quickly.

1629
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:25,106
Soon it'll be fall.

1630
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:29,418
My literature professor
really likes me.

1631
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:32,444
It was fun being out with him
last night.

1632
01:22:32,488 --> 01:22:35,355
Funny, I feel like
I'm betraying Elliot...

1633
01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:36,858
but that's ridiculous.

1634
01:22:36,893 --> 01:22:41,353
Why shouldn't I see Doug?
Elliot's not free.

1635
01:22:41,397 --> 01:22:44,525
Just go one step at a time.

1636
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:47,730
Let's see what the next
few months bring.

1637
01:22:50,206 --> 01:22:53,232
You'll be happy to know
that your money...

1638
01:22:53,276 --> 01:22:55,244
has not gone completely
to waste.

1639
01:22:55,278 --> 01:22:57,906
I have an actual
first rough draft...

1640
01:22:57,947 --> 01:22:59,539
of something I wrote.

1641
01:23:01,217 --> 01:23:04,914
I showed it to Lee.
She gave me some good pointers.

1642
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:08,913
I'm pretty near where you live.
Could I just drop it off?

1643
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:11,426
And when you have some time,
read it.

1644
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,928
We'll talk when I come over
at Thanksgiving.

1645
01:23:13,963 --> 01:23:17,797
OK? All right.
Wait. Listen.

1646
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:20,802
I think Lee met
an interesting guy at Columbia.

1647
01:23:20,836 --> 01:23:24,294
Yeah, yeah.
Well, he sounds really nice.

1648
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,468
Yeah. OK, all right.
We'll talk at Thanksgiving.

1649
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:33,840
Here's a song that Norma sang...

1650
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:36,909
on that trip we made
up to the show in Buffalo...

1651
01:23:36,953 --> 01:23:39,979
and, oh, was she beautiful
that night.

1652
01:23:40,022 --> 01:23:41,489
Come on.

1653
01:23:41,524 --> 01:23:44,357
Yes, you were.
Don't you remember that night?

1654
01:23:44,393 --> 01:23:45,883
She was so beautiful...

1655
01:23:45,928 --> 01:23:49,455
that when men saw her
walking along the streets...

1656
01:23:49,498 --> 01:23:53,264
they'd drive their cars
right up on the sidewalk.

1657
01:23:53,302 --> 01:23:54,894
That right, honey?

1658
01:23:54,937 --> 01:23:57,929
A slight exaggeration,
but only slight.

1659
01:24:25,034 --> 01:24:27,662
You've been very cold
to me tonight.

1660
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:30,967
Is something wrong?

1661
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:32,474
Not here.

1662
01:24:32,508 --> 01:24:35,500
There are too many people
around.

1663
01:24:38,414 --> 01:24:41,508
I think Lee is really serious
about her new boyfriend.

1664
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:44,178
From what I understand,
he sounds really nice.

1665
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:47,678
I'm so happy for her.
I think she's in love.

1666
01:24:47,723 --> 01:24:49,190
What's the matter?

1667
01:24:49,225 --> 01:24:51,523
I'm real upset
about what you wrote.

1668
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,686
My script?

1669
01:24:52,728 --> 01:24:55,196
It's obviously based
on Elliot and me.

1670
01:24:55,231 --> 01:24:56,198
So loosely.

1671
01:24:56,232 --> 01:24:58,029
Not so loosely.
Real specifically.

1672
01:24:58,067 --> 01:25:00,035
Is that how you see us?

1673
01:25:00,069 --> 01:25:03,038
Can I not accept gestures
and feelings from people?

1674
01:25:03,072 --> 01:25:04,869
Do I put people off?

1675
01:25:04,907 --> 01:25:07,239
- Lt's a made... up story.
- No, it's real exact.

1676
01:25:07,276 --> 01:25:09,904
The situations,
the dialogue, everything.

1677
01:25:09,945 --> 01:25:13,244
It's full of intimate details
between Elliot and me...

1678
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:16,410
which I don't see how
you could know about.

1679
01:25:16,452 --> 01:25:18,920
A conversation we had
about adoption?

1680
01:25:18,954 --> 01:25:20,421
Lee mentioned that to me.

1681
01:25:20,456 --> 01:25:22,424
Obviously,
you discussed it with her.

1682
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:25,427
I took the essence,
blew it up into drama.

1683
01:25:25,461 --> 01:25:29,124
I don't see how Lee could know.
I don't tell her everything.

1684
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:30,928
I guess I hit a nerve.

1685
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:33,560
You make it sound like
I have no needs.

1686
01:25:33,602 --> 01:25:35,866
You think
I'm too self... sufficient?

1687
01:25:35,905 --> 01:25:37,372
That's not what I meant.

1688
01:25:37,406 --> 01:25:39,897
Everybody relies on you
for so much.

1689
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:42,410
You're so giving.
It's not a criticism.

1690
01:25:42,445 --> 01:25:43,912
We love you. We're grateful.

1691
01:25:43,946 --> 01:25:45,413
Grateful, but you resent me.

1692
01:25:45,448 --> 01:25:48,417
Oh, wow. I don't want to
have this conversation.

1693
01:25:48,451 --> 01:25:49,918
I didn't do anything wrong.

1694
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,921
You said you and Elliot
were having problems.

1695
01:25:52,955 --> 01:25:55,082
Problems that are my business...

1696
01:25:55,124 --> 01:25:58,582
which I don't see how you
could know about in such detail.

1697
01:25:58,627 --> 01:26:01,061
How does Lee know about
these things? How?

1698
01:26:01,097 --> 01:26:02,064
They're private.

1699
01:26:02,098 --> 01:26:04,566
Why don't you share them
with us?

1700
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,090
I don't want to bother everyone.

1701
01:26:06,135 --> 01:26:08,603
That's the point.
I'd like to be bothered.

1702
01:26:08,637 --> 01:26:10,901
I don't see how you could
know about these things...

1703
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,874
unless Elliot's
been talking to you.

1704
01:26:12,908 --> 01:26:14,603
He hasn't.

1705
01:26:14,643 --> 01:26:17,134
If I offended you, I'm sorry.

1706
01:26:19,615 --> 01:26:23,312
It's over, Elliot. I don't know
how to be any clearer.

1707
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:25,547
- I know I deserve this...
- I'm just as much at fault.

1708
01:26:25,588 --> 01:26:27,647
If you could believe
I have such feelings...

1709
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:30,386
I've got to be honest
with you... I've met someone else.

1710
01:26:30,426 --> 01:26:32,690
What do you mean?

1711
01:26:32,728 --> 01:26:35,060
I told you I wasn't
going to wait forever.

1712
01:26:35,097 --> 01:26:36,564
It hasn't been forever.

1713
01:26:36,599 --> 01:26:39,432
It's been nearly a year
since our first time.

1714
01:26:39,468 --> 01:26:41,436
You're still married
to my sister.

1715
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:42,937
That's fine
because you're probably...

1716
01:26:42,972 --> 01:26:45,440
more in love with her
than you know.

1717
01:26:45,474 --> 01:26:46,941
We made so many plans.

1718
01:26:46,976 --> 01:26:48,443
You led me on.

1719
01:26:48,477 --> 01:26:50,945
I truly believed
you were unhappy with Hannah.

1720
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,676
I would never have
let myself be drawn in.

1721
01:26:53,716 --> 01:26:55,581
I was weak. So were you.

1722
01:26:55,618 --> 01:26:57,483
Now I've met someone else.

1723
01:27:00,322 --> 01:27:01,619
Dinner soon?

1724
01:27:01,657 --> 01:27:03,147
About fifteen minutes.

1725
01:27:03,192 --> 01:27:04,989
Good.

1726
01:27:05,027 --> 01:27:06,995
And you're in love overnight?

1727
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:09,395
I care a great deal
about him, yes.

1728
01:27:09,432 --> 01:27:13,095
It's over, Elliot. I mean it.
It's over.

1729
01:27:15,771 --> 01:27:18,103
Sweetheart, I loved your script.

1730
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:19,937
I thought it was so clever.

1731
01:27:19,975 --> 01:27:21,101
Well, you're my mother.

1732
01:27:21,143 --> 01:27:23,509
Not everybody's going
to be such a sucker.

1733
01:27:23,546 --> 01:27:25,571
I particularly liked
the character of the mother...

1734
01:27:25,614 --> 01:27:29,175
just a boozy old flirt
with a filthy mouth.

1735
01:27:29,218 --> 01:27:30,708
I'm so proud.

1736
01:27:30,753 --> 01:27:32,778
Oh, Mom. Thanks.

1737
01:27:32,822 --> 01:27:34,790
Now here's a toast
to Thanksgiving.

1738
01:27:34,824 --> 01:27:37,384
Are we supposed
to have beer? Yes!

1739
01:27:37,426 --> 01:27:38,893
Let me hear it.

1740
01:27:38,928 --> 01:27:40,452
How's that, Fletcher?

1741
01:27:40,496 --> 01:27:43,556
Now to Thanksgiving.
Here's a little toast.

1742
01:27:43,599 --> 01:27:45,191
Come on, bottoms up.

1743
01:27:45,234 --> 01:27:48,362
Have you been talking
to Holly or Lee about us...

1744
01:27:48,404 --> 01:27:49,769
about our personal life?

1745
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:51,397
Me? Of course not.

1746
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,908
There's things Holly wrote about
in her script...

1747
01:27:53,943 --> 01:27:55,410
that are so personal...

1748
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:57,912
it could only have come
from you.

1749
01:27:57,947 --> 01:27:59,938
I've got a headache,
and I don't like being accused.

1750
01:27:59,982 --> 01:28:04,442
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.
Do you find me too giving?

1751
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:06,284
Too competent?

1752
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:09,450
Too disgustingly perfect
or something?

1753
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:13,121
What's come between us?
How have I alienated you?

1754
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:14,629
Hannah, my head is throbbing.

1755
01:28:14,663 --> 01:28:16,631
You never want to talk about it.

1756
01:28:16,665 --> 01:28:20,294
When I bring it up,
you change the subject.

1757
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:21,963
We're communicating
less and less.

1758
01:28:22,004 --> 01:28:23,528
You sleep with me less and less.

1759
01:28:23,572 --> 01:28:26,632
Hannah, I am very mixed up!
Please!

1760
01:28:26,675 --> 01:28:30,270
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back?

1761
01:28:30,312 --> 01:28:32,780
They seem to know
so much about us.

1762
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:35,283
Well, maybe I've asked advice
once or twice or made a joke.

1763
01:28:35,317 --> 01:28:38,286
Do you talk to Holly
or Lee or what?

1764
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,617
Do you phone them?

1765
01:28:39,655 --> 01:28:41,122
Leave me alone, can't you?

1766
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:44,819
Jesus, I told you.
I need someone I can matter to.

1767
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:47,124
You matter to me. Completely.

1768
01:28:47,162 --> 01:28:48,686
It's hard to be
around someone...

1769
01:28:48,731 --> 01:28:52,098
who gives so much
and needs so little in return.

1770
01:28:52,134 --> 01:28:53,601
I have enormous needs.

1771
01:28:53,636 --> 01:28:56,969
I can't see them,
and neither can Lee or Holly.

1772
01:29:57,032 --> 01:30:00,160
So pitch black tonight.

1773
01:30:02,004 --> 01:30:04,029
I feel lost.

1774
01:30:05,341 --> 01:30:07,138
You're not lost.

1775
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:19,110
I love you so much.

1776
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:10,805
You may not remember me...

1777
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:14,297
but we had the worst night
of my life together.

1778
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:15,833
I remember you.

1779
01:31:15,878 --> 01:31:18,847
I was walking past,
I saw you in here...

1780
01:31:18,881 --> 01:31:20,849
and I thought we could replay...

1781
01:31:20,883 --> 01:31:22,350
We didn't hit it off.

1782
01:31:22,384 --> 01:31:24,352
We did everything
but exchange gunshots.

1783
01:31:24,386 --> 01:31:25,580
How are you?

1784
01:31:25,621 --> 01:31:27,851
Good. How are you?
You look wonderful.

1785
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:30,654
No, you do.

1786
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:33,287
Remember slamming
the cab door in my face?

1787
01:31:33,328 --> 01:31:36,297
You came very dangerously close
to emasculating my nose...

1788
01:31:36,331 --> 01:31:38,299
in a really horrible way.

1789
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:40,801
That was a long time ago.

1790
01:31:40,836 --> 01:31:41,996
People change.

1791
01:31:42,037 --> 01:31:44,471
- I hope you've changed.
- I hope you have, too.

1792
01:31:44,506 --> 01:31:47,600
Because your personality
left something to be desired...

1793
01:31:47,643 --> 01:31:49,838
namely a personality.

1794
01:31:49,878 --> 01:31:52,346
So how are you?
What are you doing?

1795
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:55,111
Nothing much. Just some stuff.

1796
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:56,845
A little of this,
a little of that.

1797
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:58,352
Was that
an embarrassing question?

1798
01:31:58,387 --> 01:32:00,855
Are you out of work
or something?

1799
01:32:00,889 --> 01:32:02,356
I've been trying to write.

1800
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:03,756
Have you?

1801
01:32:03,792 --> 01:32:05,555
Well, that's interesting.
What kind of stuff?

1802
01:32:05,594 --> 01:32:08,529
You're not interested in this.

1803
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:10,191
No, I am. I am.

1804
01:32:10,232 --> 01:32:12,996
Millions of people say to you,
"I have something I just wrote."

1805
01:32:13,035 --> 01:32:15,299
Nobody ever said it.

1806
01:32:15,337 --> 01:32:18,534
Would you be willing
to read something I wrote?

1807
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:20,940
Yes, if it would
mean anything to you.

1808
01:32:20,976 --> 01:32:22,967
I don't know why it would.

1809
01:32:23,011 --> 01:32:25,002
You've always hated
my taste in the past.

1810
01:32:25,047 --> 01:32:27,413
No, I haven't.

1811
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:30,350
I think it might make
a great television script...

1812
01:32:30,385 --> 01:32:32,353
and you're so active
in television.

1813
01:32:32,387 --> 01:32:35,845
Not anymore. I haven't been
in television for a year.

1814
01:32:35,891 --> 01:32:36,858
You're kidding.

1815
01:32:36,892 --> 01:32:38,655
I may have to
get back into it...

1816
01:32:38,694 --> 01:32:40,924
because my account says
I'm running out of dollars...

1817
01:32:40,963 --> 01:32:44,057
but, no,
I dropped out for a year...

1818
01:32:44,099 --> 01:32:46,226
which is a long, dull story.

1819
01:32:46,268 --> 01:32:47,394
You OK?

1820
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:48,869
I'm fine.

1821
01:32:48,904 --> 01:32:50,394
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1822
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:51,906
What about your script?

1823
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:55,273
I'd love it if you'd read it,
because I value your opinion.

1824
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:57,608
But you have to remember
while you're reading...

1825
01:32:57,646 --> 01:32:59,238
and you're cursing my name...

1826
01:32:59,281 --> 01:33:02,375
that this is my first script.
Well, not my first script.

1827
01:33:02,417 --> 01:33:05,443
My first script was about Hannah
and her husband...

1828
01:33:05,487 --> 01:33:09,253
but Hannah read it
and got really angry.

1829
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:10,952
I can't imagine what you wrote.

1830
01:33:10,993 --> 01:33:14,451
It wasn't anything bad,
but she just... I don't know.

1831
01:33:14,496 --> 01:33:17,954
So I threw it out,
but I have this other one.

1832
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,969
If you want me to, I'll read it.

1833
01:33:21,003 --> 01:33:23,904
Could I come over tomorrow
and read it to you?

1834
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:27,739
Come over and read it to me?
You must be joking.

1835
01:33:27,776 --> 01:33:31,143
I've done my own reading
since I was forty.

1836
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,910
It's lucky I ran into you...
maybe.

1837
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:36,383
What about me?
I should have kept going.

1838
01:33:36,418 --> 01:33:38,886
I have a nagging sensation...

1839
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:42,857
that I should have kept walking
and not begun this conversation.

1840
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:46,588
"We all go through life
playing the hand we're dealt.

1841
01:33:46,628 --> 01:33:49,995
"Craig...
And what hand were you dealt?

1842
01:33:50,032 --> 01:33:52,626
"Emily... I'm two high pair.

1843
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,727
"Maybe even aces up.

1844
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:57,762
"The problem is
you've got three deuces."

1845
01:33:59,241 --> 01:34:00,731
That's the end.

1846
01:34:02,211 --> 01:34:05,203
No, you can tell me straight.
It's OK.

1847
01:34:05,247 --> 01:34:07,715
Just tell me what you think.

1848
01:34:07,749 --> 01:34:08,977
It's great.

1849
01:34:09,017 --> 01:34:13,477
I swe... I'm...
I'm speechless. I was...

1850
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:17,481
I was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

1851
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:20,984
I don't know what to say.
I'm moved, and I laughed...

1852
01:34:21,029 --> 01:34:23,998
and I was on the edge
of my seat.

1853
01:34:24,032 --> 01:34:25,499
I just think it's wonderful.

1854
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,001
I'm totally... stunned.

1855
01:34:27,035 --> 01:34:28,434
This is not an insult.

1856
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:30,438
I'm amazed that you can...

1857
01:34:30,472 --> 01:34:32,440
I just thought it was great.

1858
01:34:32,474 --> 01:34:33,463
Really?

1859
01:34:33,508 --> 01:34:34,975
Yes, I was absolutely...

1860
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:37,979
And what made you think
of that climax scene...

1861
01:34:38,013 --> 01:34:40,846
where the architect
is walking home...

1862
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:42,214
with his actress girlfriend...

1863
01:34:42,251 --> 01:34:44,685
and the ex... wife schizophrenic
jumps out of the bushes...

1864
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,982
and stabs them to death?

1865
01:34:46,021 --> 01:34:47,818
It just came to me one day.

1866
01:34:47,856 --> 01:34:49,983
Well, it was just fabulous.

1867
01:34:50,025 --> 01:34:51,993
You really think I can write?

1868
01:34:52,027 --> 01:34:55,485
There's maybe one or two things
I'd do differently myself...

1869
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,997
but who cares?

1870
01:34:57,032 --> 01:34:59,500
It was fabulous.

1871
01:34:59,534 --> 01:35:01,525
I mean it. I'm so impressed.

1872
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:04,038
I am. You made my day.

1873
01:35:04,072 --> 01:35:05,539
It was just great.

1874
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:08,042
I was set to be bored stiff.

1875
01:35:08,076 --> 01:35:10,044
Would you like to have lunch?

1876
01:35:10,078 --> 01:35:13,047
I'd love to talk to you
about that script.

1877
01:35:13,081 --> 01:35:15,549
I think we could
do something with it.

1878
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:17,552
And I'd like to hear...

1879
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:20,054
what made you suddenly
drop out of life.

1880
01:35:20,088 --> 01:35:22,556
- Who cares?
- No. I care.

1881
01:35:22,591 --> 01:35:25,059
You used to be so ambitious,
and...

1882
01:35:25,093 --> 01:35:27,254
God, you really liked it?

1883
01:35:49,584 --> 01:35:52,553
Gosh, you really went
through a crisis, you know that?

1884
01:35:52,587 --> 01:35:54,555
How did you get over it?

1885
01:35:54,589 --> 01:35:57,752
When I ran into you,
you seemed just perfectly fine.

1886
01:35:57,793 --> 01:35:59,761
Well, you seem fine now.

1887
01:35:59,795 --> 01:36:01,558
Well, I'll tell you.

1888
01:36:01,596 --> 01:36:05,259
One day, about a month ago,
I really hit bottom.

1889
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,768
I just felt that
in a godless universe...

1890
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:10,067
I didn't want to go on living.

1891
01:36:10,105 --> 01:36:11,868
I happen to own this rifle...

1892
01:36:11,907 --> 01:36:14,102
which I loaded,
believe it or not...

1893
01:36:14,142 --> 01:36:15,609
and pressed it to my forehead.

1894
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,169
I remember thinking,
"I'm going to kill myself."

1895
01:36:18,213 --> 01:36:21,011
Then I thought,
"Well, what if I'm wrong?

1896
01:36:21,049 --> 01:36:24,280
"What if there is a god?
Nobody really knows."

1897
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:27,777
Then I thought, "No.
Maybe is not good enough.

1898
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:30,383
"I want certainty or nothing."

1899
01:36:30,425 --> 01:36:33,519
And I remember very clearly
the clock was ticking...

1900
01:36:33,562 --> 01:36:36,929
and I was sitting there frozen
with the gun to my head...

1901
01:36:36,965 --> 01:36:39,490
debating whether to shoot.

1902
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,199
All of a sudden,
the gun went off.

1903
01:36:43,238 --> 01:36:44,535
I'd been so tense...

1904
01:36:44,573 --> 01:36:46,939
my finger had squeezed
the trigger inadvertently.

1905
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:49,102
But I was perspiring so much...

1906
01:36:49,144 --> 01:36:52,409
the gun had slid off my forehead
and missed me.

1907
01:36:52,447 --> 01:36:55,814
Suddenly, neighbors
were pounding on the door...

1908
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:59,548
and the whole scene
was just pandemonium.

1909
01:36:59,588 --> 01:37:01,818
And, you know,
I ran to the door.

1910
01:37:01,857 --> 01:37:05,486
I didn't know what to say.
I was embarrassed and confused.

1911
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:07,995
My mind was racing
a mile a minute.

1912
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:12,160
I just knew one thing...
I had to get out of that house.

1913
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,136
I had to get out in
the fresh air and clear my head.

1914
01:37:16,171 --> 01:37:19,038
And I remember very clearly,
I walked the streets.

1915
01:37:19,074 --> 01:37:20,132
I walked and walked.

1916
01:37:20,175 --> 01:37:22,439
I didn't know what
was going through my mind.

1917
01:37:22,477 --> 01:37:26,311
It all seemed so violent
and unreal to me.

1918
01:37:26,348 --> 01:37:29,374
I wandered for a long time
on the Upper West Side.

1919
01:37:29,418 --> 01:37:31,045
It must have been hours.

1920
01:37:31,086 --> 01:37:34,055
My feet hurt.
My head was pounding.

1921
01:37:34,089 --> 01:37:35,716
I had to sit down.

1922
01:37:35,757 --> 01:37:38,089
I went into a movie house.
I didn't know what was playing.

1923
01:37:38,126 --> 01:37:42,495
I just needed a moment to gather
my thoughts and be logical...

1924
01:37:42,531 --> 01:37:46,365
and put the world back
into rational perspective.

1925
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:57,278
And I went upstairs
to the balcony...

1926
01:37:57,312 --> 01:37:58,939
and I sat down.

1927
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,677
The movie was a film I'd seen
many times in my life...

1928
01:38:02,717 --> 01:38:03,945
since I was a kid...

1929
01:38:03,985 --> 01:38:06,112
and I always loved it.

1930
01:38:06,154 --> 01:38:08,622
I'm watching these people
up on the screen...

1931
01:38:08,657 --> 01:38:12,058
and I started getting
hooked on the film, you know?

1932
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:14,255
And I started to feel...

1933
01:38:14,296 --> 01:38:16,764
"How can you even think
of killing yourself?

1934
01:38:16,798 --> 01:38:18,595
"Isn't it so stupid?

1935
01:38:18,633 --> 01:38:21,158
"Look at all the people
up there on the screen.

1936
01:38:21,203 --> 01:38:24,798
"They're real funny,
and what if the worst is true...

1937
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,276
"there's no god, and you only
go around once, and that's it?

1938
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:31,575
"Don't you want to be
part of the experience?

1939
01:38:31,613 --> 01:38:34,081
"What the hell?
It's not all a drag."

1940
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:36,175
And I'm thinking to myself...

1941
01:38:36,218 --> 01:38:38,209
"Jeez, I should stop
ruining my life...

1942
01:38:38,253 --> 01:38:40,721
"searching for answers
I'm never going to get...

1943
01:38:40,755 --> 01:38:43,724
"and just enjoy it
while it lasts.

1944
01:38:43,758 --> 01:38:45,419
"And after, who knows?

1945
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,758
"Maybe there is something.
Nobody really knows.

1946
01:38:47,796 --> 01:38:50,663
"I know maybe
is a very slim reed...

1947
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:52,223
"to hang your whole life on...

1948
01:38:52,267 --> 01:38:54,428
"but that's the best we have."

1949
01:38:54,469 --> 01:38:56,937
And then I started
to sit back...

1950
01:38:56,972 --> 01:39:00,169
and I actually began
to enjoy myself.

1951
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:01,835
Hello, Freedonia

1952
01:39:01,877 --> 01:39:03,674
Oh, don't you cry for me

1953
01:39:03,712 --> 01:39:05,907
I'm a... comin' round the mountain

1954
01:39:07,949 --> 01:39:11,646
There's something that's been
bothering me for a long time...

1955
01:39:11,686 --> 01:39:14,587
and I thought
I'd tell you what it was...

1956
01:39:14,623 --> 01:39:17,353
and clear the deck here,
and that's this...

1957
01:39:17,392 --> 01:39:20,156
I've always regretted
the way I behaved...

1958
01:39:20,195 --> 01:39:22,220
that evening we went out.

1959
01:39:22,264 --> 01:39:23,663
I just thought I'd tell you.

1960
01:39:23,698 --> 01:39:25,791
I really made a fool
out of myself.

1961
01:39:25,834 --> 01:39:27,301
No, don't be ridiculous.

1962
01:39:27,335 --> 01:39:31,328
I was...
You know, it was my fault.

1963
01:39:31,373 --> 01:39:34,467
So you want to go out to dinner
again?

1964
01:39:34,509 --> 01:39:36,500
You have any interest in that,
or...

1965
01:39:36,545 --> 01:39:37,512
Sure. Sure.

1966
01:39:37,546 --> 01:39:40,037
Do you?
Are you free this evening?

1967
01:39:47,756 --> 01:39:50,224
I want ice. Who's got some...

1968
01:39:50,258 --> 01:39:51,885
- Oh, there.
- Lt's on the table, Dad.

1969
01:39:51,927 --> 01:39:53,554
Where's Holly? She's late.

1970
01:39:53,595 --> 01:39:55,927
Hannah, did you read
that last thing Holly wrote?

1971
01:39:55,964 --> 01:39:57,226
It's great.
She's really developed.

1972
01:39:57,265 --> 01:39:59,392
She really writes good dialogue.

1973
01:39:59,434 --> 01:40:01,868
Hannah, can I tell everybody
you're going to play Desdemona?

1974
01:40:01,903 --> 01:40:04,064
Mom, it's only television.

1975
01:40:04,105 --> 01:40:05,834
It's public television.

1976
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:08,399
Shakespeare doesn't get
any greater than "Othello."

1977
01:40:08,443 --> 01:40:10,274
You with some big black stud.

1978
01:40:10,312 --> 01:40:11,438
I love it.

1979
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:13,106
Oh, honey!

1980
01:40:38,506 --> 01:40:41,771
Oh, Lee, you are something.

1981
01:40:42,777 --> 01:40:44,404
You look very beautiful.

1982
01:40:45,747 --> 01:40:47,408
Marriage agrees with you.

1983
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:51,378
Everything
that happened between us...

1984
01:40:51,419 --> 01:40:54,411
seems more and more hazy.

1985
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,888
I acted like such a fool.

1986
01:40:57,926 --> 01:41:00,394
I don't know what came over me.

1987
01:41:00,428 --> 01:41:04,558
The complete conviction that
I couldn't live without you.

1988
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:07,432
What I put us both through.

1989
01:41:07,469 --> 01:41:10,700
And Hannah,
who, as you once said...

1990
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:13,230
I loved much more
than I realized.

1991
01:41:18,647 --> 01:41:20,478
Happy Thanksgiving!

1992
01:41:22,484 --> 01:41:24,975
Daisy.
I didn't miss dinner, did I?

1993
01:41:25,987 --> 01:41:27,955
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving.

1994
01:41:27,989 --> 01:41:29,889
- Hello, darling.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

1995
01:41:29,924 --> 01:41:31,084
Thank you.

1996
01:42:33,254 --> 01:42:34,744
Beautiful.

1997
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:41,054
Don't get nervous.
It's just your husband.

1998
01:42:41,096 --> 01:42:43,428
Hi. How you doing?
When'd you get here?

1999
01:42:43,465 --> 01:42:45,626
A few minutes ago.

2000
01:42:45,667 --> 01:42:47,726
You look so beautiful.

2001
01:42:47,769 --> 01:42:50,237
I was talking
to your father before...

2002
01:42:50,271 --> 01:42:52,739
and I was telling him
that it's ironic...

2003
01:42:52,774 --> 01:42:55,242
I used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah...

2004
01:42:55,276 --> 01:42:58,507
and I never thought
I could love anybody else...

2005
01:42:58,546 --> 01:43:00,343
and here it is years later...

2006
01:43:00,382 --> 01:43:01,940
and I'm married to you...

2007
01:43:01,983 --> 01:43:04,451
and completely in love with you.

2008
01:43:04,486 --> 01:43:07,944
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

2009
01:43:07,989 --> 01:43:10,423
It really is.

2010
01:43:10,458 --> 01:43:12,289
Make a great story, I think.

2011
01:43:12,327 --> 01:43:14,158
Guy marries one sister.

2012
01:43:14,195 --> 01:43:15,628
Doesn't work out.

2013
01:43:15,663 --> 01:43:19,997
Then years later, he winds up
married to the other sister.

2014
01:43:20,034 --> 01:43:23,265
How you going to top that?

2015
01:43:26,107 --> 01:43:27,267
What?

2016
01:43:28,376 --> 01:43:29,673
I'm pregnant.

2017
01:46:54,216 --> 01:46:55,673
