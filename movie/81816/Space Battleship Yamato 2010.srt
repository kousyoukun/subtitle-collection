1
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,493
Locked on Gamilas ship.
How long?

2
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:15,472
15 seconds till we're clear.

3
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,604
All Units,
Clear cannon trajectory.

4
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,310
Roger.

5
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:37,150
2199, off mars.

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,665
Let them come in close.

7
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,158
Five seconds.

8
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:49,230
4, 3, 2, 1...

9
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:51,208
Fire shock cannons!

10
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:57,242
Huh?!

11
00:01:57,282 --> 00:02:00,217
They're stronger than our data says!

12
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:01,776
That's brand-new data!

13
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,751
How did they shift?

14
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:18,499
We're hit aft!

15
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:19,936
Losing thrust!

16
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:25,739
Turrets 1 and 2 hit!

17
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:28,405
Fuyuzuki destroyed!

18
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,748
Incoming!

19
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,258
Quick! Get that fire out!

20
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:47,791
We have no ship
that can beat them.

21
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,968
Message from yukikaze.

22
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:54,434
We're getting wiped out, captain.

23
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:58,538
We'll cover you. Get out of here.

24
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,211
Kodai! Don't be a fool!

25
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:04,841
I've never wished more
than to be of use to you.

26
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:06,783
You've still got things to do!

27
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,683
Captain Okita...

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,747
...we're proud to have fought
alongside you.

29
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,829
Sanada...go get 'em!

30
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,624
Don't, Kodai!

31
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:32,440
Kodai...

32
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,520
The infinite reaches of space...

33
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,661
...a realm of silent light.

34
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:57,525
Stars die, and stars are born.

35
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,767
Yes. The universe is alive.

36
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:05,443
But at this moment...

37
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:11,211
...the end is near for one planet.

38
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:19,915
Space Battleship Yamato

39
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,220
Five years ago...

40
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:29,798
...an unknown enemy appeared
in the region of mars...

41
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:35,432
...and began raining meteorite bombs
down upon the earth.

42
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:41,207
The year is 2199.

43
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:46,844
The beautiful blue earth
is polluted by radiation...

44
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:51,686
...and humanity stands
on the verge of extinction.

45
00:04:55,227 --> 00:05:00,290
People have fled underground,
struggling desperately to survive...

46
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:03,233
...but with no hope left...

47
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:07,932
...now they simply sit
and wait for the end.

48
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,377
You're one of them damn fools,
aren't you.

49
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:18,807
Looking for metal scraps
to give to the defense force.

50
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,619
What good'll that do?

51
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,787
We're beat, and you know it.

52
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,921
No.

53
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,820
That guy...

54
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:37,767
...trades it for stuff
from his brother in the forces.

55
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,768
Drugs, alcohol...

56
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:45,503
The forces? Is that right?

57
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:46,875
Yeah.

58
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,715
You trade rare metals, right?

59
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:56,611
So that's what you're up to, huh?

60
00:05:56,655 --> 00:06:00,421
Hook me up, with that brother of yours, OK?

61
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,796
What's that for?!

62
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:05,449
Lithium, 50 centimeters down.

63
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,156
Radiation density 14 sieverts.

64
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:15,155
Twice fatal dosage. You will die.

65
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,736
I know that, analyzer.

66
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:20,669
Yes.

67
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:24,664
Flying object! Incoming!

68
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:40,344
This is the capsule
that was recovered.

69
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,909
What's that?

70
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,154
It's like...

71
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,918
...schematics.

72
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,221
Who found it?

73
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:59,221
A civilian salvage hunter.

74
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:04,360
His suit was ripped open
and he took a high dose of radiation.

75
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:10,238
They're washing him down now
but he probably won't survive.

76
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,638
Okita!

77
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:13,666
Hold it!

78
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:14,803
Keep still!

79
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,473
Hold onto him!

80
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:20,275
He seems fine now, though.

81
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:24,444
Stop! You'll contaminate
the entire ship!

82
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,122
Are you captain okita?

83
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:29,586
Why?

84
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:39,296
You used yukikaze as a shield.

85
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,937
Then you ran away.

86
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:46,469
Right?

87
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:49,771
Answer me!

88
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:51,281
Kodai, stop it!

89
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,578
Kodai?

90
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,353
Mamoru Kodai was my brother.

91
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:00,316
You're Susumu Kodai?

92
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,158
You used him as a shield...

93
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:08,697
...sacrificed your whole escort,
and you're still alive?

94
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:12,894
Doesn't that bother you?

95
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:16,237
Why should it?

96
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,572
Don't make me laugh.

97
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:26,311
That's enough!

98
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:30,176
That hurt, damn it...

99
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:33,615
Yuki Mori?

100
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:38,753
What would a civilian know,
Mr. Kodai?

101
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,334
You weren't there!

102
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,195
Come quietly!

103
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,366
Let go off me!

104
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,268
Hands off!

105
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,470
Kodai!

106
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:59,773
Sometimes one has to make it back.

107
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,118
Huh?

108
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:07,757
Saito! Go easy on him!
He's an injured man.

109
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,827
I'm sorry, Captain Okita.
I didn't mean that to happen.

110
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:24,501
I went and told him
how Captain Kodai died.

111
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,841
Dr. Sado...I understand.

112
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:29,813
I'm sorry.

113
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:31,913
Anyway...

114
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,346
...how is he still alive
after a fatal dose of radiation?

115
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:40,221
Yes. He should be dead.

116
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:00,872
You had a hard time.

117
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,512
We were wiped out.

118
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:13,381
We have no way
of resisting Gamilas.

119
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:16,791
And we don't know
what they want or who they are.

120
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,259
They're tough.

121
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:25,794
As we fight, they study us
and just get stronger.

122
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:31,272
And we can't keep up with them...

123
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,915
And so...

124
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:44,353
...the time comes when
we must evacuate earth...

125
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,154
...with a chosen few.

126
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,858
On that subject, sir...

127
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,737
... I ask you for this ship.

128
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,773
What?

129
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:11,241
Not so a selected elite
can live a few days longer...

130
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:16,416
...but to go on a journey of hope.

131
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,859
In that way at least
humanity will not be in despair...

132
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,926
...but rather in hope...

133
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:35,331
...at their moment of death.

134
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,948
What kind of a story
are you going to feed them, Okita?

135
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:57,524
People of Japan,
I have an important announcement...

136
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:02,594
...concerning the future of humanity.

137
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,260
I ask you to respond calmly.

138
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:12,174
Analysis of a communications capsule
discovered off cape Bonomisaki...

139
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,515
...has revealed the following
very significant message.

140
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:24,285
This, we believe,
is our solar system...

141
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:28,656
...and our galaxy, the milky way.

142
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:33,393
Here, in the large magellanic cloud...

143
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:38,399
... is the origin of the message...

144
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,737
...the planet lskandar.

145
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,135
They have expressed a desire
to provide us with a device...

146
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:50,943
...that eliminates radiation.

147
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,480
Thus...

148
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,122
Can it go that far?

149
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,525
It might be a trap!

150
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,325
How long will it take?

151
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:12,164
There are military secrets involved,
so I can only say...

152
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:16,697
...we have received technology
by which the journey...

153
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:18,902
...can be made very quickly.

154
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,604
It's a gamble, right?

155
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,113
Are you sure they'll get back?

156
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,637
Will the public agree?

157
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,707
There's no time to ask!

158
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,648
Earth...

159
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:33,186
...is past the point...

160
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:37,786
...Where we can hem and haw
over "gambles" or "being sure".

161
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:45,696
We calculate that within one year
humanity will be extinct.

162
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:50,937
There are some who say
it is only a matter of months.

163
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:55,337
This offer from lskandar...

164
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:58,239
...for us...

165
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:03,586
... is our last hope.

166
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:07,419
Fellow citizens...

167
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:14,129
... if we can obtain this device,
we can survive.

168
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,826
Then we can...

169
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:21,434
... Ieave the underground
and live again on the surface.

170
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,501
We cannot simply stand by
as Gamilas destroys Earth...

171
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:30,537
...with its meteorite bombs.

172
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,448
We have been given this last chance!

173
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:40,155
We will, with our own hands,
restore the green Earth.

174
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,526
Shall we not, then...

175
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:51,700
...obtain this radiation device
and restore the beautiful earth...

176
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,294
...as it was five years ago?

177
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:02,637
To this end the defense force
is calling for volunteers...

178
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:09,816
...with military or astronaut
qualifications...

179
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:14,518
...with experience in
scientific research...

180
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:26,866
Kodai, Susumu.

181
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,435
You're alive!

182
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:35,570
Sorry?

183
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:38,548
I don't believe it! How?!

184
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,649
Open wide.

185
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:54,696
Doctor, do you mind?
There are people waiting.

186
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:01,170
Oh, right.

187
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:06,307
You have experience leading a...

188
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:08,436
...fighter squadron?

189
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,509
a civilian? How?

190
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:14,811
I've re-enlisted.

191
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:19,818
And I don't need that.
I've got my own.

192
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:24,758
A cat...

193
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,272
Hold it!

194
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:39,666
You're coming?

195
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,472
Why not?

196
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:41,671
It's Okita's ship.

197
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,236
I know.

198
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:44,843
Mr. Kodai!

199
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:46,281
What?

200
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:49,618
What are you up to?

201
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,179
Nothing.

202
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:56,391
Battle stations!

203
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:00,561
I'll go to the 1st bridge.
scramble the black tigers.

204
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,762
Says who?!

205
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:08,562
As of now, I'm squadron leader.
I'm counting on you, "Ace".

206
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:15,236
There is a Gamilas missile...

207
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,341
... heading straight for you.

208
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,810
They would seem to know
about your vessel.

209
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:32,821
Prepare to launch!
Shima, initiate wave engine!

210
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,425
Shima?

211
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:35,854
Roger.

212
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,142
That's it. Good boy!

213
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:06,488
This is...

214
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,364
That's right. The Yamato

215
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,453
Iaunch Yamato

216
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:35,788
Iaunching Yamato

217
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,803
1500 kilometers!

218
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:48,270
We won't make it.

219
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,631
Sanada.

220
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:53,376
We will now test the wave gun.

221
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,311
Target is the incoming missile.

222
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,545
It's not checked yet.

223
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,116
So?

224
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:04,584
Well, I think we can fire it.

225
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:09,650
It's our only chance.
Make it work.

226
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,258
Yes, Sir.

227
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:15,322
Kodai, You've read the manual?

228
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,166
Sort of.

229
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,967
But it's an alien-supplied weapon.
I've never used one before.

230
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:25,738
Well, it's do or die.

231
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,269
1200 kilometers!

232
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,379
Raise wave-motion engine pressure.
close emergency valves.

233
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,357
Raising wave-motion engine pressure.
closing emergency valves.

234
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,528
Open wave-gun outlet.

235
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,694
Opening outlet.

236
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:54,396
Chamber pressure rising!

237
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:58,169
All energy to wave-motion gun.
initiate forced induction.

238
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,905
Initiating.

239
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,873
Prepare to fire.

240
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:09,515
Shima, let Kodai do it.

241
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,687
It's all yours.

242
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:22,130
Release wave-motion gun safety.

243
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,465
Releasing. Safety locks at zero.

244
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:28,471
Pressure approaching firing point.
Releasing final safety.

245
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:35,207
Yamato on missile trajectory.

246
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,209
Lock on that.

247
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:42,444
Raising scope.

248
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:51,685
Contrast gauge at brightness 20.
target: interplanetary missile.

249
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,321
Range 180!

250
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:56,197
Energy at 100 per cent.

251
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:58,861
Wait.

252
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:04,399
Energy at 120 per cent!

253
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:06,133
Chamber limit!

254
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,313
10 seconds to firing.
Brace for shock and flash.

255
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,218
Range 70! Collision course!

256
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:19,485
Five...

257
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:20,490
Four...

258
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:21,952
Three...

259
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:23,188
Two...

260
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:24,561
One...

261
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,594
Firing!

262
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:47,316
All systems down!

263
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:48,477
Restart!

264
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,578
Back-up camera functioning.

265
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,526
Where's Yamato?

266
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,493
Unable to confirm.

267
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,827
Did it vaporize?

268
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:27,522
The Yamato.

269
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,521
Yamato made it!

270
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:48,610
We used the wave-motion gun.
We've given ourselves away.

271
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:55,244
You had no choice.
I just hope the Yamato is all right.

272
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,245
Can you proceed?

273
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:59,847
Yes.

274
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:05,687
I want to leave the solar system
before they can strike back.

275
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,354
All right.

276
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:17,230
Godspeed, Yamato

277
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:18,799
Aye-aye, Sir.

278
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:27,915
Warp test will take place
in 24 hours.

279
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:29,743
Roger!

280
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:57,212
Right into the thick of it, huh?

281
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:01,615
It's your turn next. The warp.

282
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:06,616
But I'm surprised you volunteered.

283
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:10,320
She's our last ship.
And it's for Jiro's sake, too.

284
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,386
Oh, Yeah...How old is he now?

285
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,556
He's five.

286
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,530
Yeah?

287
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:22,295
It's been five years...

288
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:24,470
Mr. Kodai!

289
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:28,904
Kato? Yamamoto?
You guys are here?

290
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,649
We got posted to the ship today.

291
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:35,618
It'll be great
to fly under you again!

292
00:27:35,652 --> 00:27:36,584
Right?

293
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,088
Furuya...

294
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:46,288
Mr. Kodai.

295
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,288
Still moping in the back, huh?

296
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:49,629
Not me, Sir.

297
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,361
See? Am I right?

298
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:53,631
He's right.

299
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:04,137
Team Kodai requests permission
to join the Yamato squadron!

300
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:06,412
You still say that?

301
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,213
Damn right!

302
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:13,814
That looks so stupid!

303
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:14,846
Huh?!

304
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:23,531
We brought this aboard
to celebrate our reunion!

305
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,930
You too, Kato.

306
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:27,728
Team Kodai, be seated!

307
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:30,262
Keep it down, will you?

308
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:34,535
You'll spoil my drink.

309
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:36,939
Mori!

310
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:39,539
Why get on Mr. Kodai's case?

311
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:42,814
If we'll spoil your drink,
Why drink alone here?

312
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,852
This is the mess.
We're not causing any trouble.

313
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,358
No?

314
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:51,785
Team Kodai?

315
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:54,922
Those old stories don't depress you?

316
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:56,729
What?!

317
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:01,569
Mori, you were part of team Kodai.

318
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:05,507
You were just a babe
in huge diapers back then.

319
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:10,109
I'll be our ace soon. Watch out.

320
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,818
Mr. Kodai,
why did you come back now?

321
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,622
Where were you then?

322
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,879
Then?

323
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:28,321
When Captain Kodai got killed.
When we lost our fleet!

324
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:31,594
While we fought for our lives...

325
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:35,463
...you were back on earth
salvaging scrap.

326
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,506
You got scared and ran,
didn't you.

327
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,617
I can't accept...

328
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:53,620
...the great Susumu Kodai...

329
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:57,223
...fearing for his life...

330
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:01,858
...and running.

331
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:02,922
Mori!

332
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:07,898
Idiot!

333
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:28,153
Attention all hands.
When Yamato reaches mars orbit...

334
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:32,389
...We will conduct humanity's first
warp test. If we fail...

335
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,661
...We, and all humanity,
face destruction.

336
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,864
I ask you to focus on your duties.
That is all.

337
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:45,234
Stand by to warp.

338
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:46,207
Hey...

339
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:47,733
...What's "warp"?

340
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:51,145
I think we jump over
a big piece of space.

341
00:30:55,852 --> 00:30:56,750
Mr. Akagi...

342
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:58,814
Board me.

343
00:30:58,855 --> 00:30:59,822
Right!

344
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:01,517
Ready BT1!

345
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,155
I guess the cockpit's
as safe a place as any.

346
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:10,232
What's she so scared of?

347
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:16,235
Warp!

348
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,198
Warping!

349
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:47,537
Did we make it?

350
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:00,148
Hey...

351
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:03,443
Hey, guys...

352
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:15,289
No hull damage.

353
00:32:15,632 --> 00:32:18,601
All clear ahead. No gravity field!

354
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:20,602
It worked.

355
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:22,229
Yes!

356
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:25,736
Mr. Kodai! We warped! Mr. Shima!

357
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:27,470
This is some ship!

358
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:29,903
Returning to course.

359
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:39,582
Huh?

360
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:43,892
Aihara! 1 o'clock.

361
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:46,894
Gamilas!

362
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,639
Why did you bring us here?!

363
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,233
I didn't!

364
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,335
Did they track our warp energy?

365
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,246
All hands to battle stations!

366
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:06,340
Ready wave gun!

367
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:07,281
Roger.

368
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:10,650
We can't fire it right after warp.

369
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,848
It uses the same energy.

370
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:15,952
Wait.

371
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:24,363
We'll warp again.

372
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:26,497
How long will that take?

373
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:31,466
20 minutes to recharge.

374
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:36,268
In 20 minutes
can you find where we'll come out?

375
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:37,211
I'lll find it.

376
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:38,179
Kodai...

377
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:41,679
...cripple their warp engines
so they can't follow.

378
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,652
Roger.

379
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:47,282
Black Tigers...

380
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,817
...take out their warp engines.

381
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:51,619
Let's go!

382
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,664
Mori, launching.

383
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:07,470
She beat us to the punch!

384
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,578
We should've been ready.

385
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:16,580
Are you trying to show off?

386
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,783
Don't get smart. This is how
I survived the fight off mars.

387
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:23,385
We warp in 20 minutes.
Be back by then.

388
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:24,893
Roger.

389
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,388
Yes!

390
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:04,422
Wow...

391
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:24,413
Don't forget to look out behind.

392
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:34,754
Commencing targeting
the Gamilas mother ship.

393
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:36,654
Roger.

394
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:50,402
Targeting complete.

395
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:51,709
Fire cannons.

396
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:52,578
Firing.

397
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:15,738
Yay!

398
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:16,670
Yes!

399
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:17,604
Wow!

400
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,666
I've never seen one go
like that before...

401
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:24,613
Target destroyed!

402
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:25,545
Right!

403
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:27,880
Way to go, Kodai!

404
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:35,146
Well done. Return to base.
We're about to warp.

405
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,818
Shima, how long?

406
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,294
Five minutes to full charge.

407
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:42,787
Aihara, have you found somewhere
for us to go?

408
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:43,924
Just about.

409
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:52,602
Kato here. No sign of Mori.
we can't raise her.

410
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:53,807
What?!

411
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:57,208
BT1, do you read?

412
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:00,540
BT1!

413
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,345
Do you read?

414
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:05,119
Yuki Mori!

415
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,620
I read you.

416
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,516
What's wrong?

417
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,697
Oxygen supply very low.
Remedy immediately.

418
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:27,371
The debris took out my engine.

419
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:30,369
You can't move?

420
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,574
Just leave me here.

421
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,350
Don't be stupid! Hang on.

422
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:40,151
There's no time!

423
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,181
Return to your post.

424
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:48,358
And leave her
like you did my brother?

425
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,837
I'll be back in time.

426
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:58,135
Nanbu, take over.

427
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,134
Idiot!

428
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:07,340
Continue with preparations
for warp.

429
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:08,350
Sir!

430
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:13,618
Aihara, call out the enemy positions
as they move.

431
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:14,889
Yes, Sir.

432
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:23,494
Mr. Kodai?

433
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:32,174
Two minutes to warp capability.

434
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,778
Emergence point confirmed.

435
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,478
Emergence point clear
of obstructions.

436
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:46,649
It's all right.

437
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:52,558
Suffocation doesn't hurt.

438
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,922
It's all right. I'm not afraid.

439
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,795
I'm not afraid.

440
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,206
Yuki Mori,
will your ejection gear work?

441
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,707
Do you read me?

442
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:11,372
Go back!

443
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:13,439
I'm messing you all up.

444
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:16,577
Answer me!
Will your ejection gear work?

445
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:23,517
Yes.

446
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:24,724
Right.

447
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:26,957
I'll say when.

448
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:30,523
Five bogeys closing at 9:20!

449
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,698
Fire!

450
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:43,375
Port side, aft!

451
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,176
Sub-nozzle's out!

452
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:47,544
They rammed us?

453
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:51,579
Their fighters have nowhere
to go back to.

454
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:53,783
Gamilas!

455
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:54,619
Where?

456
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:56,488
Large squadron approaching!

457
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:11,938
Damn it!

458
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,607
I'm behind you, Yuki.

459
00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:20,646
Roger.

460
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,218
Go!

461
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:48,268
Recharging complete.

462
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:54,815
20 Gamilas vessels
nearing impact.

463
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:58,346
There's Mr. Kodai.

464
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:01,715
Shima...

465
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:05,756
...think of them as missiles.

466
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:11,763
Let them come in close,
then roll sideways to evade.

467
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:14,798
Roger!

468
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:17,464
Brace for lateral gs.

469
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:20,739
We will evade...

470
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:25,409
...then take Kodai aboard
while the Gamilas are turning.

471
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:27,382
Then we will warp.

472
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:32,116
Hey! What's going on?!

473
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:38,452
Readying for evasive action.
All personnel prepare for g-force.

474
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:44,426
Five seconds to impact point!

475
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:45,559
Four...

476
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:46,824
Three...

477
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:48,260
Evading!

478
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:58,711
Open entry port!

479
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,310
He's in!

480
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:03,443
Warp!

481
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:17,859
Her heart's stopped!

482
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:20,329
Where's Dr. Sado?

483
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,961
Coming.

484
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,433
Yuki...

485
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:25,600
Yuki!

486
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:33,680
I'll defibrillate. Keep going.

487
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:38,915
Yuki! Don't die on me!

488
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:41,722
Damn it!

489
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:49,823
Doctor!

490
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:50,798
Stretcher!

491
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:55,665
Lift her. 1, 2, 3...

492
00:42:58,574 --> 00:42:59,768
Let's go.

493
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:20,926
Your actions endangered this ship.
That is a serious offence.

494
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:27,803
That is how I do things.

495
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:32,671
I will not stand back and watch
my subordinates die.

496
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:35,500
Throw him in the brig!

497
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:43,585
I'll come quietly!

498
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:54,318
Move!

499
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:08,235
You still like it in the brig, Huh?

500
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,146
Chief Tokugawa...

501
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:14,613
It's been a while.

502
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:19,177
You're in the brig already?
You never change.

503
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:24,516
Just for doing what I think is right.
Why does this happen?

504
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,858
You're two of a kind.

505
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:35,664
You're just like your older brother
when he was young.

506
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,306
I'm like who?

507
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:43,439
Fiery, a loose cannon,
but cool under pressure.

508
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:50,151
You know, Kodai,
You just might be cut out...

509
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:53,451
...to be a ship's captain yourself.

510
00:44:58,628 --> 00:45:01,654
Whoever you're saying I'm like now,
My way and a certain someone's...

511
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:04,689
...are completely opposite.

512
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,458
Oh yeah?

513
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:14,242
I was about to say you're a lot like
Captain Okita when he was young.

514
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,840
Anyway, I guess we'll find out.
If we survive, that is.

515
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:28,187
Look who's here!

516
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:29,555
Hello, Doctor.

517
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:31,787
Doctor, how's Mori?

518
00:45:32,628 --> 00:45:34,858
Fine. Just a few scratches.

519
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:36,194
Thank you.

520
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:37,494
Let's have a drink.

521
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:38,500
Great!

522
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:50,407
You should be grateful to the captain.
He took a big chance.

523
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:54,348
He was in a very tight spot
and he hung in to the last.

524
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:58,880
He did?

525
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:04,383
You realize
in that battle off mars...

526
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:08,363
...You're not the only one
who lost someone.

527
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:14,897
Is this a sermon?

528
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:20,767
Did you know that the Fuyuzuki
didn't come back, either?

529
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:29,546
Captain Okita's son
was its navigator.

530
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,574
This is the Captain.

531
00:47:01,684 --> 00:47:05,211
We are about to leave
the solar system.

532
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:12,292
We are heading out into a realm
where no human being has ever been.

533
00:47:12,428 --> 00:47:16,330
Communication with earth
will be impossible.

534
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:21,333
Thus today
all hands will have access...

535
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,861
...to communications.

536
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:28,370
This could be your last message
to earth.

537
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:33,180
I ask you all to take proper leave
of your families.

538
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:44,418
I'm like Okita? Me?

539
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,455
Yeah, Right!

540
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,426
You have one minute.

541
00:47:53,736 --> 00:47:57,536
The channel
will then shut down.

542
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,608
Think what you want to say
before you go in.

543
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,458
Enter lD number.

544
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:26,791
What I want to say?

545
00:48:29,138 --> 00:48:30,730
There's dad!

546
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:34,432
How are you, Jiro?

547
00:48:35,678 --> 00:48:36,576
How are you?

548
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:38,773
Oh, I'm fine.

549
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:44,246
Make sure you don't catch cold.

550
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:45,844
I'll be fine.

551
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:48,220
I'll be fine!

552
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,555
I'm too stupid to catch a cold.

553
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:55,288
Wrap a towel around your stomach
when you sleep.

554
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:57,299
You always get the runs.

555
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,698
I'll be back soon.

556
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,495
I miss you.

557
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:13,477
Don't worry. I'll be back,
with that radiation device.

558
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:17,151
Promise?

559
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:19,149
I promise!

560
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:21,555
Jiro...

561
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,353
Channel closed.

562
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:35,233
Do you have your hachiman amulet?
It'll keep the bullets away.

563
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:37,297
Yep.

564
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:41,106
I have it.

565
00:49:42,444 --> 00:49:43,934
And don't forget...

566
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:45,738
Channel closed.

567
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:52,818
You worry too much.

568
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,123
287, 288...

569
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,459
...289, 290...

570
00:50:01,497 --> 00:50:02,930
What?

571
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:06,764
You're doing sit-ups here?

572
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:09,329
So?

573
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,905
You're last on the list
to send a message.

574
00:50:17,846 --> 00:50:19,143
A message?

575
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:22,845
Input your lD number first.
You have one minute.

576
00:50:22,885 --> 00:50:23,909
Id number?

577
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:25,684
That one there.

578
00:50:26,855 --> 00:50:27,947
This one?

579
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:29,181
Yes.

580
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:30,818
Mr. Kodai!

581
00:50:31,493 --> 00:50:32,926
How are you?

582
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:34,421
Hey!

583
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:37,591
I'm kidding, Ando.
You're here, too?

584
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:41,729
Yes. Assigned to 3rd bridge!

585
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,668
Yeah?

586
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:51,277
Be seeing you.

587
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:57,650
My parents are fine.
I swore I'd be back.

588
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:03,849
Wait here.

589
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:06,217
Roger.

590
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:18,673
So you're ok? Great.

591
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:22,210
I won't thank you.

592
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:29,843
I'd rather have died
than endanger this ship.

593
00:51:35,224 --> 00:51:39,627
Look, could you just
go a little easier?

594
00:51:40,496 --> 00:51:42,293
Relax a bit.

595
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:45,296
You owe me one.

596
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:47,565
What's that?

597
00:51:47,603 --> 00:51:48,627
Gotcha.

598
00:52:05,254 --> 00:52:08,223
Enter lD number.

599
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:26,540
You're drinking?

600
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:28,602
You're ok?

601
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:30,669
I'm fine.

602
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,409
You saw Kodai?

603
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:38,284
By the message room.

604
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:42,222
He's talking to his family now.

605
00:52:42,257 --> 00:52:45,226
His family? Who?

606
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:49,222
Weren't you in Team Kodai?

607
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:54,861
Yes, but he quit just after
I was assigned there.

608
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:58,839
Then I was posted,
so I'm not really one of them.

609
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:00,366
I see.

610
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:04,905
I only ever joined the force
because I admired Susumu Kodai...

611
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:08,242
...the "Cosmo Zero" ace.

612
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:14,452
So I guess I feel
kind of sold out.

613
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:18,887
Don't tell him that

614
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:23,121
Well, the reason he quit...

615
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:24,655
Yes?

616
00:53:28,604 --> 00:53:31,630
A message to my family...

617
00:53:33,709 --> 00:53:36,542
When the Gamilas started bombing...

618
00:53:36,578 --> 00:53:39,547
...we used to go up after them.

619
00:53:40,616 --> 00:53:44,211
The bombs were more fragile,
so we destroyed some...

620
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:46,653
...and knocked a few off course.

621
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:49,413
I know. It was famous.

622
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:54,192
He was the ace,
and I wasn't too bad, either.

623
00:53:54,663 --> 00:53:59,532
So one day we diverted a bomb,
and saved the planet again.

624
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:01,593
We were delighted.

625
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:08,209
But this time the story
had a different ending.

626
00:54:13,482 --> 00:54:15,814
I guess you're my family.

627
00:54:17,853 --> 00:54:20,287
So how've you been?

628
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:25,686
Don't start crying, Mr. Kodai.
You'll mess me up, too.

629
00:54:25,727 --> 00:54:27,820
What are you talking about?

630
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:35,428
The bomb we diverted
crashed into space station 2.

631
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:37,963
Oh, that...

632
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:44,309
And to make things worse,
his parents were living there...

633
00:54:44,346 --> 00:54:46,871
...and so was my pregnant wife.

634
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:53,652
They managed to save the child,
but he's never been able to talk.

635
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:01,220
Kodai left the force right after that.

636
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:08,431
Channel closed.

637
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:54,541
The space battleship Yamato
heads for the large magellanic cloud...

638
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,746
...to the planet lskandar...

639
00:55:57,786 --> 00:56:00,914
...to obtain an anti-radiation device
said to exist there.

640
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:08,687
All clear ahead. No gravity field.
Warp successful.

641
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:14,298
Bogey! It's a Gamilas fighter!

642
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:16,133
One?

643
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:16,865
Yes.

644
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:18,395
It's shut down.

645
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:22,107
It's not attacking.

646
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:23,202
No?

647
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:24,876
I'll bring it up.

648
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:31,486
Did it warp with us?

649
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:34,248
Kodai...

650
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:38,359
Bring it aboard.

651
00:56:39,494 --> 00:56:41,962
We'll analyze it.

652
00:56:42,564 --> 00:56:43,656
Roger.

653
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:50,303
Captain!

654
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:52,569
Call sick bay!

655
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:53,768
Take over!

656
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:55,401
Captain!

657
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:18,695
Well, Doctor?

658
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:25,440
It's progressing.

659
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:31,543
So how long
do you think I've got?

660
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:38,718
Soon those won't suppress it
any more.

661
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:52,928
Will I make it?

662
00:58:12,854 --> 00:58:17,188
It might be unmanned.
Where's the cockpit?

663
00:58:17,225 --> 00:58:19,750
I've never seen one this way.

664
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:22,593
You've seen lots of them.

665
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,266
Always through a canopy.

666
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,397
No signs of life.

667
00:58:30,439 --> 00:58:32,270
Is it a drone?

668
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:33,605
Saito...

669
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:37,378
Take a fuselage sample.
be careful, quick, and accurate.

670
00:58:38,346 --> 00:58:40,940
As the tech officer says...

671
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:44,512
..."Careful, Quick, and accurate".

672
00:58:51,226 --> 00:58:51,885
Fire!

673
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:55,220
Right! Right!

674
00:58:55,464 --> 00:58:59,525
Left! Go Left! Fire! Fire!

675
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:30,528
Mr. Sanada!

676
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,662
Saito!

677
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:38,634
Saito!

678
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:40,864
Fight it!

679
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:44,276
Get the doctor!

680
00:59:44,312 --> 00:59:45,301
Right!

681
00:59:46,214 --> 00:59:47,146
Hey!

682
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:03,788
Crew of the Yamato...

683
01:00:04,966 --> 01:00:06,627
The earth is...

684
01:00:07,736 --> 01:00:09,761
...ours.

685
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:14,231
Who are you?

686
01:00:17,412 --> 01:00:19,277
Desla.

687
01:00:19,848 --> 01:00:21,440
Desla?

688
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:28,251
You call us "Gamilas".

689
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:34,662
Is that crystal thing you?

690
01:00:35,263 --> 01:00:38,357
Yes, and No.

691
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:43,831
We are both individuals,
and one being.

692
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:50,869
As if we were Alpha and Omega.

693
01:00:59,354 --> 01:01:01,481
Why are you attacking earth?

694
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:06,417
Attacking?

695
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:13,491
We are renovating it.

696
01:01:20,242 --> 01:01:21,334
Saito?

697
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,372
Saito!

698
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:38,284
Don't shoot!

699
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,964
That hurt!

700
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,497
Sorry.

701
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:54,872
But it takes that much power
to shut down your life functions.

702
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,344
Thanks a heap!

703
01:01:57,379 --> 01:02:00,712
Level 2 on a pulse gun
could stop a bear!

704
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:05,915
Then I guess level 2
was the right choice.

705
01:02:11,526 --> 01:02:13,357
It still hurt!

706
01:02:13,628 --> 01:02:16,791
But anyone other than you
would be in sick bay now.

707
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,492
And it brought you back.

708
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:25,537
For that, I thank you.

709
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,641
You owe me one.

710
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:30,141
Ok...

711
01:02:30,478 --> 01:02:31,467
What?

712
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,783
And so...I will buy you a beer.

713
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:38,410
Cheapskate!

714
01:02:56,638 --> 01:02:58,868
Kodai reporting.

715
01:02:59,607 --> 01:03:00,505
Come in.

716
01:03:07,482 --> 01:03:08,506
Excuse me.

717
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:21,159
Yes, Sir?

718
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:25,929
Kodai...

719
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,935
How do you like the ship?

720
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:41,481
I've never served on a battleship,
so I can't compare...

721
01:03:42,283 --> 01:03:43,682
...but she's a fine ship.

722
01:03:57,365 --> 01:04:00,334
What did you wish to discuss?

723
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:05,399
Kodai...

724
01:04:09,444 --> 01:04:12,675
...would you take over
as Acting Captain?

725
01:04:14,749 --> 01:04:15,613
Sir?

726
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:23,753
I'd hoped Mamoru Kodai
would succeed me as captain.

727
01:04:24,759 --> 01:04:26,192
My brother?

728
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:31,160
You have it in you
just like he did.

729
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:34,902
You belong in charge.

730
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:37,933
Well?

731
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:39,197
No, Thank you.

732
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:41,834
I couldn't do it.

733
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:44,270
Not me.

734
01:04:46,614 --> 01:04:49,174
Not the way you do.

735
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:56,152
No? That's too bad.

736
01:04:56,658 --> 01:04:57,682
Excuse me.

737
01:04:58,393 --> 01:04:59,325
Kodai...

738
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:04,390
There is no need to emulate me.

739
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:07,498
Do it your way.

740
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:16,442
All right, in that case...

741
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:26,881
...I will put it in the form
of an order.

742
01:05:28,656 --> 01:05:32,217
This is the captain.
Attention all hands.

743
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:40,225
Effective immediately, Susumu Kodai
is Acting Captain. That is all.

744
01:05:40,768 --> 01:05:41,632
Dismissed.

745
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:48,607
Scramble!

746
01:05:48,643 --> 01:05:53,307
Gamilas attack confirmed.
All personnel to battle stations.

747
01:05:54,282 --> 01:05:56,409
You're captain?
Where are you going?

748
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:57,383
The hangar!

749
01:06:07,629 --> 01:06:08,789
When did it start?

750
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:12,892
I don't know. We noticed it
a few minutes ago.

751
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:15,767
It's transmitting something.

752
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:21,699
an SOS?

753
01:06:21,743 --> 01:06:22,607
No.

754
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:26,580
Our location.
They're using that to attack.

755
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:29,750
Mr. Sanada, Take over here.

756
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:31,752
Black Tigers, Scramble!

757
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:34,755
Destroy that thing!

758
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:45,326
There'll be more.

759
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:47,459
Where are they?

760
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:49,663
Third wave approaching!

761
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:51,494
What?

762
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:52,836
Shima, evade!

763
01:07:06,387 --> 01:07:07,513
Damage?

764
01:07:07,755 --> 01:07:10,315
We're hit around 3rd bridge.

765
01:07:11,459 --> 01:07:13,552
Crew members trapped.

766
01:07:13,828 --> 01:07:14,658
Oxygen?

767
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:20,256
They're ok for a while.

768
01:07:20,768 --> 01:07:24,465
Send a rescue squad.
Get me 3rd bridge.

769
01:07:24,505 --> 01:07:25,563
Yes, Sir!

770
01:07:28,509 --> 01:07:31,501
The elevator shaft's hit!

771
01:07:31,546 --> 01:07:34,606
Mr. Kodai, it's Ando.
We're trapped!

772
01:07:34,649 --> 01:07:37,675
We have wounded.
Send medics!

773
01:07:38,953 --> 01:07:43,151
This is Acting Captain Kodai.
a rescue squad is on the way.

774
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:46,160
We'll get you out of there.

775
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:50,494
Hang in, Ando.
They'll be there soon.

776
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:52,493
Yes, Sir.

777
01:07:55,303 --> 01:07:56,531
Where are they?

778
01:07:56,571 --> 01:07:58,471
Bogeys at 3 o'clock.

779
01:07:58,506 --> 01:08:01,202
Shima, 90 degrees starboard.

780
01:08:03,144 --> 01:08:05,874
Charge wave-motion gun.

781
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:08,108
Charging.

782
01:08:08,149 --> 01:08:10,310
Raising scope.

783
01:08:14,689 --> 01:08:18,125
Target: large enemy gunship.

784
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:19,717
on trajectory.

785
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:23,397
Locking.

786
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:28,862
Range 60.

787
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:33,205
Energy at 120 per cent.

788
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:38,405
Ten seconds to wave gun.

789
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,377
All hands brace for shock and flash.

790
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:47,550
Five...

791
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:48,720
Four...

792
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,687
Firing!

793
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:21,247
Gunboat destroyed.
The enemy fleet is gone!

794
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:24,555
Kodai!

795
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:29,487
Impulse from below!

796
01:09:29,564 --> 01:09:30,724
Below?!

797
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:40,572
Energy rising! It's going to explode!

798
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,399
Clear 3rd bridge!

799
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:43,273
We can't!

800
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:44,539
We'll blow up!

801
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:45,739
Passing limit!

802
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,644
Kodai!

803
01:10:04,932 --> 01:10:07,492
Yuki, take out...

804
01:10:08,936 --> 01:10:10,836
...the 3rd bridge.

805
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:17,310
That's an order!

806
01:10:20,848 --> 01:10:21,712
Fire!

807
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:27,748
Roger.

808
01:11:14,735 --> 01:11:18,865
It was a stealth craft.
The radar didn't pick it up.

809
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:23,736
I should have seen it.

810
01:11:25,546 --> 01:11:28,276
The six crew on that bridge...

811
01:11:32,186 --> 01:11:33,915
...I let them die.

812
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:39,157
I am not fit to act as captain.

813
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:44,297
Then why come back?

814
01:11:49,504 --> 01:11:52,667
Why did you join up again?

815
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:03,272
To find out
what manner of man you were.

816
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:06,913
to find...

817
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:13,483
...what manner of man
let my brother die.

818
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:18,428
I see.

819
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:26,568
and...

820
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:32,608
...to see a green earth again.

821
01:12:35,349 --> 01:12:38,318
Like it was when I was a boy.

822
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:50,193
I wanted to bring that back.

823
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:56,527
Tell me...

824
01:12:57,538 --> 01:13:01,338
...as Acting Captain,
what should I have done?

825
01:13:11,786 --> 01:13:17,122
Kodai, the result isn't there
for us to brood over.

826
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:21,561
What we should do
doesn't lie in the past.

827
01:13:22,797 --> 01:13:25,425
It's here, right now.

828
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,498
You use the people you have.

829
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:31,733
In theory, perhaps,
but I'm not like you.

830
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:37,576
You can just let a situation
roll off your back.

831
01:13:40,648 --> 01:13:43,139
That's not true, Kodai.

832
01:13:45,252 --> 01:13:48,881
There was a time
when I was just like you.

833
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:58,228
If you've never held command
you don't know the pressure.

834
01:13:58,699 --> 01:14:00,166
Right?

835
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:09,204
You're doing a fine job
as Acting Captain.

836
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:13,909
Kodai...

837
01:14:16,684 --> 01:14:18,345
...There's...

838
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:26,253
...something I have to tell you.

839
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:40,135
Who is it?

840
01:14:41,275 --> 01:14:42,503
Kodai.

841
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:55,680
Why are you here?

842
01:14:58,759 --> 01:15:00,386
To apologize.

843
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:02,226
For what?

844
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:03,628
That order.

845
01:15:11,405 --> 01:15:12,702
I'm sorry.

846
01:15:14,642 --> 01:15:16,667
Why apologize?

847
01:15:18,379 --> 01:15:20,574
There's no need.

848
01:15:23,617 --> 01:15:27,917
You simply did what you had to
as Acting Captain.

849
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:32,388
And an order is an order,
even if...

850
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:36,253
...it means...

851
01:15:42,436 --> 01:15:44,336
...shooting at...

852
01:15:48,776 --> 01:15:50,573
...your own people...

853
01:16:08,562 --> 01:16:09,620
I'm sorry.

854
01:16:21,575 --> 01:16:24,169
I'm sorry I lost it.

855
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:28,614
I didn't mean...

856
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:45,888
That's fine.

857
01:16:49,336 --> 01:16:51,463
Don't say any more.

858
01:17:09,423 --> 01:17:14,656
Prepare to enter warp.

859
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:35,409
Iskandar!

860
01:17:37,785 --> 01:17:39,616
It's in sight!

861
01:17:57,771 --> 01:17:59,204
So that's...

862
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:02,775
... Iskandar...

863
01:18:10,517 --> 01:18:14,510
Missiles at 12 o'clock!
about 60! Range 500!

864
01:18:14,555 --> 01:18:17,285
They're coming from lskandar!

865
01:18:17,324 --> 01:18:18,621
The gun's not charged!

866
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:19,887
I know!

867
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:23,518
Stations!

868
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:31,896
They've split into four groups,
port, starboard, above, below.

869
01:18:31,939 --> 01:18:34,203
All guns lock on targets!

870
01:18:38,245 --> 01:18:38,904
Ten seconds!

871
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:41,240
All guns...fire!

872
01:18:48,155 --> 01:18:50,623
Large missile! 10 seconds to impact!

873
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:07,833
It didn't explode!

874
01:19:08,776 --> 01:19:10,869
Damage report!

875
01:19:11,478 --> 01:19:13,673
Sir! The wave gun!

876
01:19:13,714 --> 01:19:15,204
What about it?

877
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:18,908
The muzzle's been blocked!

878
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:24,616
What?!

879
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:31,193
Enemy fleet ahead!

880
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:37,194
Fix that wave gun!
Ready all other guns!

881
01:19:42,409 --> 01:19:44,104
They'll wear us down.

882
01:19:44,645 --> 01:19:49,139
Missiles, second wave.
Impact in 30 seconds.

883
01:19:49,183 --> 01:19:51,879
There's too many to take out!

884
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,482
Warp us out of here.

885
01:19:55,522 --> 01:19:56,614
Where to?

886
01:19:56,657 --> 01:19:58,215
Anywhere!

887
01:19:58,258 --> 01:19:59,589
It won't work!

888
01:19:59,626 --> 01:20:00,593
Incoming!

889
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,462
Shima!

890
01:20:27,154 --> 01:20:28,451
Kodai!

891
01:20:29,423 --> 01:20:33,291
If there'd been anything here,
We'd have been obliterated!

892
01:20:33,327 --> 01:20:37,161
We would have been anyway!

893
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:43,461
Where are we?

894
01:20:44,638 --> 01:20:47,471
Still near lskandar.

895
01:20:48,842 --> 01:20:50,537
Look!

896
01:20:58,185 --> 01:21:03,521
Is that the same planet
as before?

897
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:13,924
Affirmative.
We're behind lskandar now.

898
01:21:14,635 --> 01:21:16,899
It looks just like earth!

899
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:34,111
It's Gamilas.

900
01:21:34,154 --> 01:21:35,246
What?

901
01:21:36,657 --> 01:21:38,716
This was a Gamilas missile.

902
01:21:40,427 --> 01:21:44,193
Have we come to Gamilas
instead of lskandar?

903
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,397
I'll bet this is a trap.

904
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:50,164
A trap?

905
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:51,762
A Gamilas trap.

906
01:21:52,673 --> 01:21:56,632
Iskandar, the radiation device,
all lies.

907
01:21:57,144 --> 01:21:58,839
We've been had!

908
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,875
Why would they do that?

909
01:22:03,851 --> 01:22:05,785
To lure us away.

910
01:22:08,255 --> 01:22:13,488
Maybe the radiation device
Was just a story.

911
01:22:15,362 --> 01:22:19,890
There was nothing about it
in that capsule I analyzed.

912
01:22:19,933 --> 01:22:23,664
Only directions here
and plans for the wave-motion engine.

913
01:22:24,638 --> 01:22:25,935
Meaning?

914
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:32,838
Someone might have made up
the radiation-device story.

915
01:22:33,714 --> 01:22:37,673
Why? Why would they do that?

916
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:41,720
Why did we come here?

917
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:47,292
Was the captain lying?

918
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:52,265
Never! Captain Okita wouldn't do that.

919
01:22:52,633 --> 01:22:53,895
I'll go ask him.

920
01:22:53,934 --> 01:22:56,903
No! This isn't the time.

921
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:58,663
It's that bad?

922
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:03,467
I'll go.

923
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:04,534
Saito!

924
01:23:05,245 --> 01:23:08,214
He's the only one
who knows the truth, right?

925
01:23:10,617 --> 01:23:13,245
We need to ask him now!

926
01:23:13,754 --> 01:23:15,949
Our fate rides on it!

927
01:23:16,156 --> 01:23:19,455
Doesn't it, "Acting Captain"?

928
01:23:24,364 --> 01:23:26,525
We'll go down there.

929
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:32,700
The message gave coordinate points.
We might learn something there.

930
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:34,502
Kodai! Are you crazy?!

931
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,270
We walk into their arms?

932
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:40,770
If this was a trap,
why would they attack us now?

933
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:48,582
There must be a reason
they don't want us going down there.

934
01:23:51,325 --> 01:23:56,456
And anyway, there were directions
and an engine plan in that capsule.

935
01:23:56,797 --> 01:24:02,667
We have to go to those coordinates
and find out what this is all about.

936
01:24:04,671 --> 01:24:07,469
The captain believed that message.

937
01:24:09,109 --> 01:24:10,406
And l...

938
01:24:13,547 --> 01:24:15,378
...believe in him.

939
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:20,677
He would not lie
about his feelings for earth.

940
01:24:25,892 --> 01:24:27,450
Mr. Sanada...

941
01:24:30,697 --> 01:24:31,686
Yuki...

942
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:36,666
Saito!

943
01:24:39,906 --> 01:24:41,271
Shima...

944
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:47,614
Whose ship is this, anyway?

945
01:24:50,617 --> 01:24:55,247
The 8th of the coordinates
we were sent indicate...

946
01:24:55,289 --> 01:24:59,555
...a point below the surface
of lskandar/Gamilas, here.

947
01:25:00,427 --> 01:25:02,691
Our mission is to go there.

948
01:25:03,163 --> 01:25:06,326
Landing will be
the black tigers, the paratroopers...

949
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:09,267
...tech officer Sanada,
and myself.

950
01:25:10,304 --> 01:25:11,669
Why you, Sir?

951
01:25:13,907 --> 01:25:18,207
Mr. Kodai will go first to knock out
their aerial defense system.

952
01:25:18,245 --> 01:25:19,303
Look.

953
01:25:20,614 --> 01:25:23,879
This is the zone above
the landing point.

954
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:28,219
An armed, floating defense system.

955
01:25:28,588 --> 01:25:30,749
We'll have to slip through it.

956
01:25:32,392 --> 01:25:33,518
Impossible!

957
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,619
Not for the Cosmo Zero.

958
01:25:36,263 --> 01:25:40,461
It predates the Gamilas attack,
and has stealth capacity.

959
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:45,164
But Gamilas will detect
as soon as you use the engine.

960
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:49,641
I'll be gliding in.

961
01:25:57,684 --> 01:26:00,414
The black tigers attack on my order.

962
01:26:00,721 --> 01:26:05,590
You'll escort the troop carrier down.
Proceed with caution.

963
01:26:05,892 --> 01:26:07,917
They could be anywhere.

964
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:14,191
Can one Cosmo zero take out
a whole defense system?

965
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:27,245
Attention all personnel.
This is Acting Captain Kodai.

966
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:31,279
Our landing...

967
01:26:31,885 --> 01:26:35,616
...on lskandar/Gamilas
is about to commence.

968
01:26:37,758 --> 01:26:41,524
This will probably be the last battle
in our long journey...

969
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:45,258
...of 148,000 light-years.

970
01:26:50,604 --> 01:26:55,871
In April of 1945,
the battleship Yamato...

971
01:26:56,910 --> 01:27:01,540
...Set sail to bring a ray of hope
into a time of utter despair.

972
01:27:02,749 --> 01:27:04,341
We do the same.

973
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:10,586
The coordinates we were sent
may be a trap.

974
01:27:11,792 --> 01:27:16,923
We may only be playing
into the enemy's hands.

975
01:27:16,963 --> 01:27:22,424
But as long as there is
one faint ray of light in the dark...

976
01:27:22,469 --> 01:27:28,601
...as long as we have even a chance,
We must go forward.

977
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:33,771
That is the destiny
of any ship named Yamato.

978
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:39,376
And that is the mission
we have been assigned.

979
01:27:41,288 --> 01:27:45,588
I ask you all to remember that.

980
01:27:49,963 --> 01:27:52,124
Let us win this fight!

981
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:56,726
and transform a faint chance
into real hope!

982
01:27:58,472 --> 01:28:00,872
For those we have left on earth...

983
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:08,642
No...for the families we love...

984
01:28:09,349 --> 01:28:12,284
...Let us make earth green again!

985
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:16,286
For this ship...

986
01:28:25,165 --> 01:28:26,393
...and for Captain Okita.

987
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:33,306
...I ask you all to give
everything you have!

988
01:28:46,419 --> 01:28:48,819
We'll take the left wing.

989
01:28:48,855 --> 01:28:50,015
Mr. Kodai!

990
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:01,928
Right!

991
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:04,869
It's our turn at last!

992
01:29:07,073 --> 01:29:08,097
Work!

993
01:29:08,808 --> 01:29:10,275
Do it right!

994
01:29:11,077 --> 01:29:12,635
To lskandar!

995
01:29:14,147 --> 01:29:17,048
You probably won't make it back.

996
01:29:21,054 --> 01:29:24,080
That's all we need to get us going!

997
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:27,115
See you there.

998
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:52,347
I haven't been here for a while.

999
01:29:52,385 --> 01:29:55,582
Well, I'm counting on you.

1000
01:29:56,189 --> 01:29:57,213
Roger.

1001
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:11,562
What?

1002
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:13,869
Are you going to show off?

1003
01:30:15,809 --> 01:30:18,437
Who are you to talk?

1004
01:30:19,312 --> 01:30:21,109
Don't mess up, Ok?

1005
01:30:29,522 --> 01:30:33,117
Launching CZ1.

1006
01:30:59,986 --> 01:31:05,322
Mr. Kodai, what was all that about
with Ms Yuki?

1007
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,891
All I needed to get me going.

1008
01:31:45,065 --> 01:31:48,159
8,000 meters to surface.

1009
01:31:48,535 --> 01:31:49,593
7,000...

1010
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:51,365
6,000...

1011
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:52,569
5,000...

1012
01:31:53,206 --> 01:31:55,834
Not yet not yet not yet...

1013
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:56,807
Go!

1014
01:32:09,089 --> 01:32:10,249
Uh-oh...

1015
01:32:16,963 --> 01:32:18,430
Shima!

1016
01:32:25,205 --> 01:32:26,866
Come back alive.

1017
01:32:27,674 --> 01:32:30,074
Right! Time to warp!

1018
01:32:35,648 --> 01:32:36,512
You ok?

1019
01:32:36,549 --> 01:32:38,176
We're all here!

1020
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:50,593
Mr. Kodai...I'll be top scorer today.

1021
01:32:52,866 --> 01:32:55,562
Whatever. You still mope.

1022
01:32:55,935 --> 01:32:57,698
No, I don't!

1023
01:32:58,404 --> 01:32:59,530
Furuya!

1024
01:33:00,106 --> 01:33:02,040
They're above us!

1025
01:33:31,571 --> 01:33:34,165
They're all around the carrier!

1026
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:35,037
Roger.

1027
01:33:50,623 --> 01:33:51,715
Yamamoto...

1028
01:33:57,864 --> 01:33:59,627
Yamamoto!

1029
01:34:03,236 --> 01:34:05,136
Enemy destroyed!

1030
01:34:05,171 --> 01:34:09,665
There's three of us left
with the troop carrier.

1031
01:34:11,544 --> 01:34:12,875
Roger.

1032
01:34:17,617 --> 01:34:20,950
Arriving at coordinate point.

1033
01:34:26,726 --> 01:34:28,284
It's beautiful...

1034
01:34:33,233 --> 01:34:36,361
The coordinate point is in there.

1035
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:40,071
All units land.

1036
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:52,816
Fire!

1037
01:34:53,286 --> 01:34:54,719
Yuki, quick!

1038
01:34:56,923 --> 01:34:57,890
Saito!

1039
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:04,119
Move out!

1040
01:35:05,231 --> 01:35:06,323
Right!

1041
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:20,776
Damn it!

1042
01:35:21,114 --> 01:35:24,140
There's hundreds of them!

1043
01:35:33,626 --> 01:35:36,993
Analyzer! Stand-alone mode!
Cover us!

1044
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,455
Leave it to me.

1045
01:35:57,817 --> 01:35:58,442
Hurry.

1046
01:35:58,785 --> 01:36:00,616
Cover me!

1047
01:36:06,693 --> 01:36:08,888
Hey! Hey!

1048
01:36:20,606 --> 01:36:23,097
Make it back to earth, Mr....

1049
01:36:23,776 --> 01:36:25,209
Analyzer!

1050
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:33,343
I'm sorry.

1051
01:36:54,273 --> 01:36:55,103
Quick!

1052
01:37:05,718 --> 01:37:07,379
I'll hold here!

1053
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:11,816
Kato!

1054
01:37:12,925 --> 01:37:18,158
I probably won't hold it very long.
Hurry.

1055
01:37:20,566 --> 01:37:21,533
Move it!

1056
01:37:23,736 --> 01:37:24,668
Go!

1057
01:37:27,106 --> 01:37:28,437
Quick!

1058
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:46,520
The coordinates point here.

1059
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,301
This is lskandar?

1060
01:37:57,537 --> 01:37:58,401
Yuki...

1061
01:38:03,843 --> 01:38:04,673
Hey...

1062
01:38:08,247 --> 01:38:10,010
Yuki!

1063
01:38:13,352 --> 01:38:15,820
We have awaited you.

1064
01:38:19,058 --> 01:38:20,491
Yuki?

1065
01:38:21,928 --> 01:38:24,123
Saito went the same way.

1066
01:38:24,163 --> 01:38:27,599
So the lskandar story was true?

1067
01:38:27,967 --> 01:38:31,596
That is the name one of you gave it.

1068
01:38:35,374 --> 01:38:39,868
Yes...a man named Okita.

1069
01:38:40,513 --> 01:38:41,878
What?!

1070
01:38:43,015 --> 01:38:44,107
I knew it!

1071
01:38:46,552 --> 01:38:47,712
Kodai...

1072
01:38:48,788 --> 01:38:50,483
...there's...

1073
01:38:51,357 --> 01:38:53,951
...something i have to tell you.

1074
01:38:55,228 --> 01:38:59,164
That story about
a radiation device on lskandar...

1075
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:02,429
... isn't true.

1076
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:10,738
What's going on?!

1077
01:39:10,776 --> 01:39:16,544
We were sent coordinates,
and schematics.

1078
01:39:17,316 --> 01:39:18,943
That's all.

1079
01:39:19,552 --> 01:39:21,417
Why the story?

1080
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:25,020
Because of you.

1081
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:27,587
Me?

1082
01:39:28,327 --> 01:39:32,423
You survived a high dosage
of radiation.

1083
01:39:33,232 --> 01:39:36,963
That has been kept secret.

1084
01:39:38,371 --> 01:39:41,363
I took a gamble...

1085
01:39:41,941 --> 01:39:45,138
...that the sender of the capsule...

1086
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:49,513
...could eliminate radiation.

1087
01:39:54,187 --> 01:39:58,385
So with no guarantee of anything...

1088
01:39:59,859 --> 01:40:02,419
...we're going to lskandar?

1089
01:40:03,129 --> 01:40:04,357
That's right.

1090
01:40:09,735 --> 01:40:10,861
But...

1091
01:40:15,975 --> 01:40:18,535
...we have hope and a chance.

1092
01:40:23,382 --> 01:40:28,684
You came on board this ship
hoping for something, right?

1093
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:35,719
And our chances aren't zero.

1094
01:40:38,331 --> 01:40:43,064
You're here right now, alive.

1095
01:40:51,677 --> 01:40:54,703
That in itself is a chance.

1096
01:40:57,383 --> 01:41:00,079
We are a more evolved race...

1097
01:41:00,152 --> 01:41:03,019
...sharing a single conscious mind.

1098
01:41:03,055 --> 01:41:06,957
One manifestation
of this shared consciousness...

1099
01:41:06,993 --> 01:41:09,325
...you call "Gamilas".

1100
01:41:09,362 --> 01:41:13,799
Another manifestation
you call "lskandar".

1101
01:41:15,201 --> 01:41:20,639
Gamilas and lskandar exist
as two sides of the same coin.

1102
01:41:23,542 --> 01:41:27,945
Our planet is about to disintegrate.

1103
01:41:28,381 --> 01:41:33,114
Iskandar accepts this,
and is resigned to vanishing with it.

1104
01:41:33,152 --> 01:41:37,851
But Gamilas wishes
to eliminate all earthlings...

1105
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:42,918
...and render your planet
fit for us to move to.

1106
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:47,024
Iskandar opposes this.

1107
01:41:47,366 --> 01:41:51,132
Gamilas has separated from us,
and enclosed us in here.

1108
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:57,371
That small fragment of lskandar
that remains in Gamilas...

1109
01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:00,538
...we secretly sent to earth.

1110
01:42:01,947 --> 01:42:03,778
That capsule?

1111
01:42:06,452 --> 01:42:11,446
And eliminating radiation?
That's what we came for.

1112
01:42:13,793 --> 01:42:15,727
Have no fear.

1113
01:42:16,395 --> 01:42:19,922
There is no such device...

1114
01:42:19,965 --> 01:42:23,128
...but I can fulfill its function...

1115
01:42:24,837 --> 01:42:27,135
...as you have experienced.

1116
01:42:35,881 --> 01:42:40,909
Prove it. Show us
you can really do that.

1117
01:42:40,953 --> 01:42:43,114
We want to be sure!

1118
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:56,596
This area is clear of radiation.

1119
01:42:57,470 --> 01:43:00,303
You can now breathe its air.

1120
01:43:24,397 --> 01:43:26,092
It's ok.

1121
01:43:30,136 --> 01:43:32,661
I will grant your wish.

1122
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:37,801
My energy should be sufficient.

1123
01:43:43,849 --> 01:43:45,077
Yuki!

1124
01:43:48,187 --> 01:43:49,586
I'm fine.

1125
01:43:58,063 --> 01:43:59,496
It's fine.

1126
01:44:09,975 --> 01:44:10,907
Wait!

1127
01:44:12,945 --> 01:44:14,469
Mr. Sanada!

1128
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:28,118
From the energy,
I'd say that's the Gamilas source.

1129
01:44:28,627 --> 01:44:31,391
We can stop the attacks.

1130
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:39,094
Bastards!

1131
01:44:40,072 --> 01:44:41,505
Let's do it!

1132
01:44:45,511 --> 01:44:46,773
Kodai...

1133
01:44:47,246 --> 01:44:49,771
I'll take it out. Cover me.

1134
01:44:49,815 --> 01:44:51,407
You won't get close!

1135
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:55,648
Once we get across,
You two leave with the Yamato.

1136
01:44:55,688 --> 01:44:56,882
You're crazy!

1137
01:44:56,922 --> 01:44:57,786
Saito!

1138
01:45:00,426 --> 01:45:02,053
Roger!

1139
01:45:04,296 --> 01:45:05,661
Wait!

1140
01:45:06,031 --> 01:45:07,828
I can't leave you.

1141
01:45:07,867 --> 01:45:10,927
Acting Captain!
Stop being a jerk!

1142
01:45:13,506 --> 01:45:14,495
Saito!

1143
01:45:15,841 --> 01:45:18,332
That hurt, Damn it!

1144
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:21,243
The ship can't go without its captain.

1145
01:45:21,313 --> 01:45:21,870
But...

1146
01:45:21,914 --> 01:45:22,539
Kodai!

1147
01:45:27,586 --> 01:45:32,387
You're like a little brother to me.

1148
01:45:42,668 --> 01:45:44,932
Don't look like that.

1149
01:45:50,476 --> 01:45:52,706
Be a great captain.

1150
01:45:56,248 --> 01:45:57,306
Let's go!

1151
01:45:57,349 --> 01:45:58,839
Fix the earth.

1152
01:46:01,153 --> 01:46:03,280
I owe you this one.

1153
01:46:06,592 --> 01:46:07,923
Right!

1154
01:46:29,848 --> 01:46:32,476
Quick! Get going, you two!

1155
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,714
Let's go.

1156
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:39,684
Run!

1157
01:46:44,797 --> 01:46:45,661
Right!

1158
01:47:30,676 --> 01:47:34,635
Careful, quick, and accurate.
come on, tech officer!

1159
01:47:35,381 --> 01:47:38,077
I'm almost done. Hold them off!

1160
01:47:38,617 --> 01:47:39,879
Roger!

1161
01:47:57,903 --> 01:48:02,772
That hurts, Damn it!

1162
01:48:17,089 --> 01:48:18,716
Just a bit more.

1163
01:48:22,895 --> 01:48:24,453
Be there for me!

1164
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:31,902
You bastards!

1165
01:48:46,785 --> 01:48:48,150
Oh, no...

1166
01:48:51,056 --> 01:48:54,958
It's all right.
My Cosmo Tiger will fly.

1167
01:49:03,736 --> 01:49:05,260
Done!

1168
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:09,307
Saito!

1169
01:49:20,252 --> 01:49:21,446
Saito!

1170
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:05,694
Let's go home.

1171
01:50:20,512 --> 01:50:25,006
So there was something
for the radiation?

1172
01:50:25,651 --> 01:50:26,515
Yes.

1173
01:50:32,891 --> 01:50:34,859
There really was...

1174
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:39,128
Yes.

1175
01:50:43,602 --> 01:50:47,629
A future, and a chance...

1176
01:50:48,106 --> 01:50:50,438
...bought with many lives.

1177
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:55,976
Proceed with caution, Kodai.

1178
01:51:00,752 --> 01:51:01,650
Yes, Sir.

1179
01:51:03,655 --> 01:51:05,953
Entering final warp.

1180
01:51:06,592 --> 01:51:09,857
Earth will be in visual range.

1181
01:51:14,233 --> 01:51:17,168
You'd better go.

1182
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:28,439
Excuse me.

1183
01:51:37,155 --> 01:51:39,555
All right...

1184
01:51:40,759 --> 01:51:44,559
...Now the duel with death.

1185
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:48,826
Doctor...

1186
01:51:49,801 --> 01:51:52,895
...Could I be alone for a while?

1187
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:06,308
Dr. Sado...

1188
01:52:07,653 --> 01:52:09,052
...Thank you.

1189
01:52:46,992 --> 01:52:48,391
Where's earth?

1190
01:52:53,665 --> 01:52:54,689
There.

1191
01:52:56,335 --> 01:52:57,359
Where?

1192
01:52:58,136 --> 01:52:59,899
That red planet.

1193
01:53:03,976 --> 01:53:05,170
Yes.

1194
01:53:07,045 --> 01:53:08,706
That's earth!

1195
01:53:08,747 --> 01:53:10,339
Yes!

1196
01:53:13,518 --> 01:53:14,746
It's earth!

1197
01:53:17,189 --> 01:53:19,020
We're back!

1198
01:53:19,725 --> 01:53:21,249
Yamato?

1199
01:53:22,928 --> 01:53:28,366
This is space battleship Yamato.
Acting Captain Kodai and 36 crew.

1200
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:33,133
We are now 420,000 kilometers
from earth.

1201
01:53:33,772 --> 01:53:37,139
Did you find anything?

1202
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:40,844
Of course, commander.

1203
01:53:41,847 --> 01:53:46,216
We have the anti-radiation device.

1204
01:53:46,985 --> 01:53:48,543
You do?!

1205
01:53:48,587 --> 01:53:51,750
The anti-radiation device...

1206
01:53:54,793 --> 01:53:57,728
There really was one?

1207
01:53:57,763 --> 01:53:58,695
Yes, Sir!

1208
01:54:00,932 --> 01:54:05,767
So Okita won his bet...

1209
01:54:08,006 --> 01:54:09,735
Well done.

1210
01:54:10,942 --> 01:54:14,537
Very well done!

1211
01:54:21,853 --> 01:54:23,320
We will soon...

1212
01:54:24,689 --> 01:54:27,783
...be arriving on earth.

1213
01:54:30,429 --> 01:54:32,124
Until then...

1214
01:54:34,766 --> 01:54:36,393
... hold out.

1215
01:54:44,876 --> 01:54:47,140
Earth, huh?

1216
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:52,780
Everyone's always glad...

1217
01:54:53,585 --> 01:54:55,815
...to get back.

1218
01:55:23,315 --> 01:55:24,646
What's that?!

1219
01:55:25,417 --> 01:55:28,944
Large Gamilas vessel at 7 o'clock.
We're taking fire!

1220
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:30,078
Battle stations!

1221
01:55:30,122 --> 01:55:30,645
Roger!

1222
01:55:30,689 --> 01:55:32,384
Damage report!

1223
01:55:33,024 --> 01:55:33,854
Fire crew!

1224
01:55:33,892 --> 01:55:35,120
They're coming!

1225
01:55:43,768 --> 01:55:45,065
Port guns hit!

1226
01:55:45,103 --> 01:55:47,697
The hull won't take this!

1227
01:55:47,739 --> 01:55:49,570
Launchers blocked!

1228
01:55:49,608 --> 01:55:51,235
Turret 2 hit!

1229
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:57,941
Engine malfunction!

1230
01:55:58,984 --> 01:56:02,215
Tokugawa! How's that engine?

1231
01:56:03,588 --> 01:56:07,217
Mechanical officer! Tokugawa!

1232
01:56:08,927 --> 01:56:11,361
Output reduced...

1233
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:16,233
...but we can still move.

1234
01:56:17,202 --> 01:56:18,692
Tokugawa?

1235
01:56:20,272 --> 01:56:22,263
Tokugawa!

1236
01:56:53,338 --> 01:56:54,327
Is that...

1237
01:56:56,575 --> 01:56:58,509
...A spaceship?

1238
01:57:03,148 --> 01:57:07,949
So you thought you'd won,
crew of the Yamato?

1239
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:14,124
And what would be victory?

1240
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:18,061
Destroying us?

1241
01:57:18,496 --> 01:57:23,126
Or returning earth
to its former state?

1242
01:57:25,937 --> 01:57:27,632
Desla...

1243
01:57:29,241 --> 01:57:32,506
Or is it "Gamilas"?

1244
01:57:33,144 --> 01:57:37,103
The answer is both "Yes" and "No".

1245
01:57:37,882 --> 01:57:41,784
Your attack destroyed most of us.

1246
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:45,278
I am part
of the fragment that remains.

1247
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:54,827
We have given up
on making earth ours.

1248
01:57:55,700 --> 01:58:01,104
Most of those who would have
moved there have been lost.

1249
01:58:01,139 --> 01:58:05,542
So let us say on that point
the victory is yours.

1250
01:58:06,278 --> 01:58:07,404
But...

1251
01:58:08,847 --> 01:58:11,907
...we will not give you back
your earth.

1252
01:58:13,418 --> 01:58:14,908
What do you mean?

1253
01:58:17,756 --> 01:58:21,317
Earth is about to disappear.

1254
01:58:24,796 --> 01:58:28,027
You have enraged us.

1255
01:58:28,967 --> 01:58:34,064
We are a race
that does not forget humiliation.

1256
01:58:39,344 --> 01:58:42,609
Life signs negative.

1257
01:58:43,915 --> 01:58:46,076
What's happening?!

1258
01:58:58,296 --> 01:59:01,561
What's that?!

1259
01:59:10,809 --> 01:59:14,745
A nuclear reaction.
A huge amount of energy!

1260
01:59:17,916 --> 01:59:21,408
It's going to destroy earth!

1261
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,181
Damn him!

1262
01:59:27,826 --> 01:59:31,159
Nanbu, leave that.

1263
01:59:31,963 --> 01:59:33,396
We'll stop him.

1264
01:59:33,431 --> 01:59:35,626
We've got nothing left!

1265
01:59:39,971 --> 01:59:43,930
The wave-motion gun.
Can't we use that yet?!

1266
01:59:43,975 --> 01:59:46,375
The muzzle's blocked!

1267
01:59:47,178 --> 01:59:49,544
It'll blow up.

1268
01:59:50,248 --> 01:59:54,981
There'll be nothing left
of the Yamato!

1269
02:00:19,411 --> 02:00:22,005
I'll go ask the Captain.

1270
02:00:29,287 --> 02:00:30,584
The Captain?

1271
02:00:38,163 --> 02:00:39,562
Oh, No...

1272
02:00:57,115 --> 02:00:58,514
Think!

1273
02:00:59,784 --> 02:01:01,718
Think, Kodai!

1274
02:01:03,421 --> 02:01:07,517
Think! There must be a way!

1275
02:01:08,226 --> 02:01:11,286
Think, Kodai! Think!

1276
02:01:23,875 --> 02:01:24,864
Nanbu...

1277
02:01:26,411 --> 02:01:29,005
...do we have energy for the gun?

1278
02:01:31,983 --> 02:01:34,042
Enough for one shot.

1279
02:01:34,652 --> 02:01:38,554
But like I said, if we fire it...

1280
02:01:44,362 --> 02:01:45,556
Mr. Kodai?

1281
02:01:49,667 --> 02:01:54,798
Abandon ship. That is an order
From the Acting Captain.

1282
02:01:55,607 --> 02:01:56,938
You're coming, right?

1283
02:01:56,975 --> 02:01:59,603
Did you hear me? That's an order.

1284
02:02:00,512 --> 02:02:02,343
Get going!

1285
02:02:04,048 --> 02:02:07,347
Dr. Sado, Get the wounded.

1286
02:02:12,056 --> 02:02:14,854
Kodai, I'll stay too.

1287
02:02:14,893 --> 02:02:16,019
Shima!

1288
02:02:16,561 --> 02:02:18,825
I steer this ship.

1289
02:02:23,268 --> 02:02:25,031
Listen, Shima...

1290
02:02:25,069 --> 02:02:30,234
...the carrier will be unstable.
I'll need you to fly it!

1291
02:02:30,508 --> 02:02:31,566
Kodai!

1292
02:02:31,609 --> 02:02:32,701
Only you...

1293
02:02:33,111 --> 02:02:38,048
...can get Yuki down safely,
and she's the device!

1294
02:02:38,082 --> 02:02:38,810
But...

1295
02:02:38,883 --> 02:02:40,441
I am...

1296
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:44,451
...Acting Captain.

1297
02:02:48,626 --> 02:02:50,150
I go...

1298
02:02:52,630 --> 02:02:54,291
...with this ship.

1299
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,312
Kodai...

1300
02:03:20,992 --> 02:03:22,323
...Take control.

1301
02:03:23,995 --> 02:03:24,984
Roger.

1302
02:03:40,578 --> 02:03:43,706
All hands abandon ship!

1303
02:04:18,349 --> 02:04:22,149
Get going, Yuki.
I'll be right with you.

1304
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:27,655
I'm staying.

1305
02:04:27,692 --> 02:04:28,624
Yuki!

1306
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:32,289
If you can bail out,
then so can l!

1307
02:04:39,137 --> 02:04:40,570
Do what you're told!

1308
02:04:40,605 --> 02:04:42,937
But you're lying!

1309
02:04:45,476 --> 02:04:47,740
Life in a world without you...

1310
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:51,171
...won't mean anything!

1311
02:05:02,493 --> 02:05:03,824
Yuki...

1312
02:05:18,076 --> 02:05:23,070
...I don't have any family left.

1313
02:05:27,018 --> 02:05:29,282
but I met you here.

1314
02:05:33,224 --> 02:05:35,055
I've wanted...

1315
02:05:40,198 --> 02:05:41,665
...to care for you...

1316
02:05:44,368 --> 02:05:46,461
...and show you earth...

1317
02:05:48,706 --> 02:05:50,469
... reborn.

1318
02:05:54,879 --> 02:05:57,279
That's what I've fought for.

1319
02:06:00,651 --> 02:06:02,710
so let me finish the fight.

1320
02:06:03,955 --> 02:06:06,116
If we don't win it...

1321
02:06:06,557 --> 02:06:09,993
...everything we've done
will be meaningless!

1322
02:06:15,032 --> 02:06:17,091
If I should die...

1323
02:06:19,170 --> 02:06:21,536
...and earth comes back...

1324
02:06:24,075 --> 02:06:25,702
...I'll be alive...

1325
02:06:27,945 --> 02:06:31,073
...in every living thing there.

1326
02:06:32,150 --> 02:06:32,980
and so...

1327
02:06:39,023 --> 02:06:40,820
...I'll be with you.

1328
02:06:40,858 --> 02:06:44,316
No! I don't want you to die!

1329
02:06:45,763 --> 02:06:47,390
You can't die!

1330
02:06:48,299 --> 02:06:49,630
Yuki!

1331
02:06:58,176 --> 02:06:59,643
Thank you.

1332
02:07:03,181 --> 02:07:05,046
Goodbye.

1333
02:07:54,365 --> 02:07:55,992
Shima...

1334
02:07:57,902 --> 02:07:58,994
Kodai...

1335
02:08:00,738 --> 02:08:02,228
Take her.

1336
02:08:04,141 --> 02:08:05,438
All right.

1337
02:08:24,195 --> 02:08:25,753
She's a fine ship.

1338
02:08:29,333 --> 02:08:31,198
Don't waste her.

1339
02:09:06,437 --> 02:09:10,771
Evacuating Yamato
with 12 survivors.

1340
02:09:12,610 --> 02:09:15,477
Make sure you get back to earth.

1341
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:17,108
Roger.

1342
02:09:18,015 --> 02:09:22,281
Yamato will now attempt
to destroy the Gamilas missile.

1343
02:09:22,987 --> 02:09:24,887
Pray for me.

1344
02:09:25,323 --> 02:09:26,415
Kodai!

1345
02:09:56,954 --> 02:09:58,581
Mr. Kodai?

1346
02:10:00,691 --> 02:10:02,249
Mr. Kodai!

1347
02:10:04,962 --> 02:10:06,452
Mr. Kodai...

1348
02:10:08,532 --> 02:10:10,329
Mr. Kodai!

1349
02:10:20,778 --> 02:10:22,837
Raising scope.

1350
02:10:26,017 --> 02:10:29,145
Launching Yamato!

1351
02:12:22,266 --> 02:12:25,099
