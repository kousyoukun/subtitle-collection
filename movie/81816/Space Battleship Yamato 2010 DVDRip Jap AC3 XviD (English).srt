1
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:11,824
Locked on Gamilas ship.
How long?

2
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:14,803
15 seconds till we're clear.

3
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:22,935
All Units,
Clear cannon trajectory.

4
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,641
Roger.

5
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:36,481
2199, off mars.

6
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:42,996
Let them come in close.

7
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,489
Five seconds.

8
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:48,561
4, 3, 2, 1...

9
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:50,539
Fire shock cannons!

10
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,573
Huh?!

11
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:59,548
They're stronger than our data says!

12
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,107
That's brand-new data!

13
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:04,082
How did they shift?

14
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,830
We're hit aft!

15
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,267
Losing thrust!

16
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:25,070
Turrets 1 and 2 hit!

17
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:27,736
Fuyuzuki destroyed!

18
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:30,079
Incoming!

19
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:40,589
Quick! Get that fire out!

20
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:47,122
We have no ship
that can beat them.

21
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,299
Message from Yukikaze.

22
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,765
We're getting wiped out, captain.

23
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,869
We'll cover you. Get out of here.

24
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,542
Kodai! Don't be a fool!

25
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:04,172
I've never wished more
than to be of use to you.

26
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:06,114
You've still got things to do!

27
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:08,014
Captain Okita...

28
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,078
...we're proud to have fought
alongside you.

29
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:17,160
Sanada...go get 'em!

30
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:18,955
Don't, Kodai!

31
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:31,771
Kodai...

32
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,851
The infinite reaches of space...

33
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:50,992
...a realm of silent light.

34
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:56,856
Stars die, and stars are born.

35
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,098
Yes. The universe is alive.

36
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:04,774
But at this moment...

37
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:10,542
...the end is near for one planet.

38
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:19,246
Space Battleship Yamato

39
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,551
Five years ago...

40
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:29,129
...an unknown enemy appeared
in the region of mars...

41
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:34,763
...and began raining meteorite bombs
down upon the earth.

42
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,538
The year is 2199.

43
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:46,175
The beautiful blue earth
is polluted by radiation...

44
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:51,017
...and humanity stands
on the verge of extinction.

45
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:59,621
People have fled underground,
struggling desperately to survive...

46
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:02,564
...but with no hope left...

47
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:07,263
...now they simply sit
and wait for the end.

48
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:12,708
You're one of them damn fools,
aren't you.

49
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:18,138
Looking for metal scraps
to give to the defense force.

50
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,950
What good'll that do?

51
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:25,118
We're beat, and you know it.

52
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,252
No.

53
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,151
That guy...

54
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:37,099
...trades it for stuff
from his brother in the forces.

55
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:41,100
Drugs, alcohol...

56
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:44,835
The forces? Is that right?

57
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,207
Yeah.

58
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:51,047
You trade rare metals, right?

59
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,943
So that's what you're up to, huh?

60
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,753
Hook me up, with that brother of yours, OK?

61
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,128
What's that for?!

62
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:04,781
Lithium, 50 centimeters down.

63
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:09,488
Radiation density 14 sieverts.

64
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:14,487
Twice fatal dosage. You will die.

65
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:19,068
I know that, analyzer.

66
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:20,001
Yes.

67
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:23,996
Flying object! Incoming!

68
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,676
This is the capsule
that was recovered.

69
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:49,241
What's that?

70
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,486
It's like...

71
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,250
...schematics.

72
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,553
Who found it?

73
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,553
A civilian salvage hunter.

74
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:03,692
His suit was ripped open
and he took a high dose of radiation.

75
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:09,570
They're washing him down now
but he probably won't survive.

76
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,970
Okita!

77
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:12,998
Hold it!

78
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,135
Keep still!

79
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,805
Hold onto him!

80
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,607
He seems fine now, though.

81
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:23,776
Stop! You'll contaminate
the entire ship!

82
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,454
Are you captain okita?

83
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:28,918
Why?

84
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,628
You used yukikaze as a shield.

85
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:43,269
Then you ran away.

86
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:45,801
Right?

87
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:49,103
Answer me!

88
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,613
Kodai, stop it!

89
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:51,910
Kodai?

90
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:55,685
Mamoru Kodai was my brother.

91
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:59,648
You're Susumu Kodai?

92
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:02,490
You used him as a shield...

93
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,029
...sacrificed your whole escort,
and you're still alive?

94
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,226
Doesn't that bother you?

95
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:15,569
Why should it?

96
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,904
Don't make me laugh.

97
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,643
That's enough!

98
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:29,508
That hurt, damn it...

99
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:32,947
Yuki Mori?

100
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:38,085
What would a civilian know,
Mr. Kodai?

101
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,666
You weren't there!

102
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,527
Come quietly!

103
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:49,698
Let go off me!

104
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:51,600
Hands off!

105
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:52,802
Kodai!

106
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:59,105
Sometimes one has to make it back.

107
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,450
Huh?

108
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:07,089
Saito! Go easy on him!
He's an injured man.

109
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:17,159
I'm sorry, Captain Okita.
I didn't mean that to happen.

110
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:23,833
I went and told him
how Captain Kodai died.

111
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:27,173
Dr. Sado...I understand.

112
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,145
I'm sorry.

113
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,245
Anyway...

114
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:36,678
...how is he still alive
after a fatal dose of radiation?

115
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,553
Yes. He should be dead.

116
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,204
You had a hard time.

117
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,844
We were wiped out.

118
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:12,713
We have no way
of resisting Gamilas.

119
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:16,123
And we don't know
what they want or who they are.

120
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,591
They're tough.

121
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:25,126
As we fight, they study us
and just get stronger.

122
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,604
And we can't keep up with them...

123
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,247
And so...

124
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:43,685
...the time comes when
we must evacuate earth...

125
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,486
...with a chosen few.

126
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,190
On that subject, sir...

127
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,069
... I ask you for this ship.

128
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,105
What?

129
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:10,573
Not so a selected elite
can live a few days longer...

130
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:15,748
...but to go on a journey of hope.

131
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:23,192
In that way at least
humanity will not be in despair...

132
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,259
...but rather in hope...

133
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,664
...at their moment of death.

134
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:45,281
What kind of a story
are you going to feed them, Okita?

135
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:56,857
People of Japan,
I have an important announcement...

136
00:14:57,695 --> 00:15:01,927
...concerning the future of humanity.

137
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,593
I ask you to respond calmly.

138
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:11,507
Analysis of a communications capsule
discovered off cape Bonomisaki...

139
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:17,848
...has revealed the following
very significant message.

140
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:23,618
This, we believe,
is our solar system...

141
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:27,989
...and our galaxy, the milky way.

142
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,726
Here, in the large magellanic cloud...

143
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:37,732
... is the origin of the message...

144
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,070
...the planet lskandar.

145
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:47,468
They have expressed a desire
to provide us with a device...

146
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:50,276
...that eliminates radiation.

147
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,813
Thus...

148
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,455
Can it go that far?

149
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,858
It might be a trap!

150
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:05,658
How long will it take?

151
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:11,497
There are military secrets involved,
so I can only say...

152
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:16,030
...we have received technology
by which the journey...

153
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:18,235
...can be made very quickly.

154
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,937
It's a gamble, right?

155
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,446
Are you sure they'll get back?

156
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,970
Will the public agree?

157
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:26,040
There's no time to ask!

158
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,981
Earth...

159
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:32,519
...is past the point...

160
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:37,119
...Where we can hem and haw
over "gambles" or "being sure".

161
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:45,029
We calculate that within one year
humanity will be extinct.

162
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:50,270
There are some who say
it is only a matter of months.

163
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,670
This offer from lskandar...

164
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,572
...for us...

165
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,919
... is our last hope.

166
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,752
Fellow citizens...

167
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:13,462
... if we can obtain this device,
we can survive.

168
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:15,159
Then we can...

169
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:20,767
... Ieave the underground
and live again on the surface.

170
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:25,834
We cannot simply stand by
as Gamilas destroys Earth...

171
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:29,870
...with its meteorite bombs.

172
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:33,781
We have been given this last chance!

173
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:39,488
We will, with our own hands,
restore the green Earth.

174
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:43,859
Shall we not, then...

175
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:51,033
...obtain this radiation device
and restore the beautiful earth...

176
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:53,627
...as it was five years ago?

177
00:17:55,974 --> 00:18:01,970
To this end the defense force
is calling for volunteers...

178
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:09,149
...with military or astronaut
qualifications...

179
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:13,851
...with experience in
scientific research...

180
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,199
Kodai, Susumu.

181
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,768
You're alive!

182
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:34,903
Sorry?

183
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,881
I don't believe it! How?!

184
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:41,982
Open wide.

185
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,029
Doctor, do you mind?
There are people waiting.

186
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,503
Oh, right.

187
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:05,640
You have experience leading a...

188
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,769
...fighter squadron?

189
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,842
a civilian? How?

190
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,144
I've re-enlisted.

191
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,151
And I don't need that.
I've got my own.

192
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:24,091
A cat...

193
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,605
Hold it!

194
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:38,999
You're coming?

195
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:39,805
Why not?

196
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,004
It's Okita's ship.

197
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,569
I know.

198
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,176
Mr. Kodai!

199
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:45,614
What?

200
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,951
What are you up to?

201
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,512
Nothing.

202
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,724
Battle stations!

203
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,894
I'll go to the 1st bridge.
scramble the black tigers.

204
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:02,095
Says who?!

205
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:07,895
As of now, I'm squadron leader.
I'm counting on you, "Ace".

206
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,569
There is a Gamilas missile...

207
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:17,674
... heading straight for you.

208
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:23,143
They would seem to know
about your vessel.

209
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,154
Prepare to launch!
Shima, initiate wave engine!

210
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,758
Shima?

211
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:35,187
Roger.

212
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:55,475
That's it. Good boy!

213
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:05,821
This is...

214
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:09,697
That's right. The Yamato

215
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:32,786
Iaunch Yamato

216
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,121
Iaunching Yamato

217
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,136
1500 kilometers!

218
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,603
We won't make it.

219
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:48,964
Sanada.

220
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:52,709
We will now test the wave gun.

221
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:55,644
Target is the incoming missile.

222
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:57,878
It's not checked yet.

223
00:21:58,482 --> 00:21:59,449
So?

224
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:03,917
Well, I think we can fire it.

225
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:08,983
It's our only chance.
Make it work.

226
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:11,591
Yes, Sir.

227
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:14,655
Kodai, You've read the manual?

228
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,499
Sort of.

229
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:21,300
But it's an alien-supplied weapon.
I've never used one before.

230
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:25,071
Well, it's do or die.

231
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:29,602
1200 kilometers!

232
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,712
Raise wave-motion engine pressure.
close emergency valves.

233
00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:40,690
Raising wave-motion engine pressure.
closing emergency valves.

234
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,861
Open wave-gun outlet.

235
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,027
Opening outlet.

236
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:53,729
Chamber pressure rising!

237
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:57,502
All energy to wave-motion gun.
initiate forced induction.

238
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:01,238
Initiating.

239
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:05,206
Prepare to fire.

240
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,849
Shima, let Kodai do it.

241
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,021
It's all yours.

242
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,464
Release wave-motion gun safety.

243
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,799
Releasing. Safety locks at zero.

244
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,805
Pressure approaching firing point.
Releasing final safety.

245
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,541
Yamato on missile trajectory.

246
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,543
Lock on that.

247
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,778
Raising scope.

248
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:51,019
Contrast gauge at brightness 20.
target: interplanetary missile.

249
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,655
Range 180!

250
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,531
Energy at 100 per cent.

251
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,195
Wait.

252
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,733
Energy at 120 per cent!

253
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,467
Chamber limit!

254
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:10,647
10 seconds to firing.
Brace for shock and flash.

255
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,552
Range 70! Collision course!

256
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:18,819
Five...

257
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:19,824
Four...

258
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,286
Three...

259
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,522
Two...

260
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:23,895
One...

261
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,928
Firing!

262
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,650
All systems down!

263
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,811
Restart!

264
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,912
Back-up camera functioning.

265
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,860
Where's Yamato?

266
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,827
Unable to confirm.

267
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,161
Did it vaporize?

268
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,856
The Yamato.

269
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,855
Yamato made it!

270
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:47,944
We used the wave-motion gun.
We've given ourselves away.

271
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,578
You had no choice.
I just hope the Yamato is all right.

272
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,579
Can you proceed?

273
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,181
Yes.

274
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:05,021
I want to leave the solar system
before they can strike back.

275
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,688
All right.

276
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,564
Godspeed, Yamato

277
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,133
Aye-aye, Sir.

278
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,249
Warp test will take place
in 24 hours.

279
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,077
Roger!

280
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,546
Right into the thick of it, huh?

281
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,949
It's your turn next. The warp.

282
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,950
But I'm surprised you volunteered.

283
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,654
She's our last ship.
And it's for Jiro's sake, too.

284
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,720
Oh, Yeah...How old is he now?

285
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,890
He's five.

286
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,864
Yeah?

287
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,629
It's been five years...

288
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,804
Mr. Kodai!

289
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,238
Kato? Yamamoto?
You guys are here?

290
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,983
We got posted to the ship today.

291
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,952
It'll be great
to fly under you again!

292
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,918
Right?

293
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,422
Furuya...

294
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,622
Mr. Kodai.

295
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,622
Still moping in the back, huh?

296
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,963
Not me, Sir.

297
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,695
See? Am I right?

298
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,965
He's right.

299
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:03,471
Team Kodai requests permission
to join the Yamato squadron!

300
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,746
You still say that?

301
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,547
Damn right!

302
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:13,148
That looks so stupid!

303
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,180
Huh?!

304
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:22,865
We brought this aboard
to celebrate our reunion!

305
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,264
You too, Kato.

306
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,062
Team Kodai, be seated!

307
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,596
Keep it down, will you?

308
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,869
You'll spoil my drink.

309
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,273
Mori!

310
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,873
Why get on Mr. Kodai's case?

311
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,148
If we'll spoil your drink,
Why drink alone here?

312
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:47,186
This is the mess.
We're not causing any trouble.

313
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,692
No?

314
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,119
Team Kodai?

315
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,256
Those old stories don't depress you?

316
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,063
What?!

317
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,903
Mori, you were part of team Kodai.

318
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,841
You were just a babe
in huge diapers back then.

319
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,443
I'll be our ace soon. Watch out.

320
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:16,152
Mr. Kodai,
why did you come back now?

321
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,956
Where were you then?

322
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,213
Then?

323
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,655
When Captain Kodai got killed.
When we lost our fleet!

324
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,928
While we fought for our lives...

325
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,797
...you were back on earth
salvaging scrap.

326
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:43,840
You got scared and ran,
didn't you.

327
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,951
I can't accept...

328
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,954
...the great Susumu Kodai...

329
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,557
...fearing for his life...

330
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,192
...and running.

331
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,256
Mori!

332
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,232
Idiot!

333
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,487
Attention all hands.
When Yamato reaches mars orbit...

334
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:31,723
...We will conduct humanity's first
warp test. If we fail...

335
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:35,995
...We, and all humanity,
face destruction.

336
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,198
I ask you to focus on your duties.
That is all.

337
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,568
Stand by to warp.

338
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,541
Hey...

339
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,067
...What's "warp"?

340
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,479
I think we jump over
a big piece of space.

341
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,084
Mr. Akagi...

342
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,148
Board me.

343
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,156
Right!

344
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,851
Ready BT1!

345
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,489
I guess the cockpit's
as safe a place as any.

346
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,566
What's she so scared of?

347
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,569
Warp!

348
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,532
Warping!

349
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,871
Did we make it?

350
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,483
Hey...

351
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,778
Hey, guys...

352
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,624
No hull damage.

353
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,936
All clear ahead. No gravity field!

354
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:19,937
It worked.

355
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,564
Yes!

356
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:25,071
Mr. Kodai! We warped! Mr. Shima!

357
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,805
This is some ship!

358
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,238
Returning to course.

359
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:38,917
Huh?

360
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,227
Aihara! 1 o'clock.

361
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,229
Gamilas!

362
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,974
Why did you bring us here?!

363
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,568
I didn't!

364
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,670
Did they track our warp energy?

365
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,581
All hands to battle stations!

366
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:05,675
Ready wave gun!

367
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:06,616
Roger.

368
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,985
We can't fire it right after warp.

369
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,183
It uses the same energy.

370
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,287
Wait.

371
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,698
We'll warp again.

372
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,832
How long will that take?

373
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,801
20 minutes to recharge.

374
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,603
In 20 minutes
can you find where we'll come out?

375
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:36,546
I'lll find it.

376
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:37,514
Kodai...

377
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:41,014
...cripple their warp engines
so they can't follow.

378
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,987
Roger.

379
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,617
Black Tigers...

380
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,152
...take out their warp engines.

381
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:50,954
Let's go!

382
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:56,999
Mori, launching.

383
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,805
She beat us to the punch!

384
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,913
We should've been ready.

385
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,915
Are you trying to show off?

386
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:19,118
Don't get smart. This is how
I survived the fight off mars.

387
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,720
We warp in 20 minutes.
Be back by then.

388
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,228
Roger.

389
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:02,723
Yes!

390
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:03,757
Wow...

391
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,748
Don't forget to look out behind.

392
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:34,089
Commencing targeting
the Gamilas mother ship.

393
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,989
Roger.

394
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,737
Targeting complete.

395
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:51,044
Fire cannons.

396
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:51,913
Firing.

397
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,073
Yay!

398
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,005
Yes!

399
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:16,939
Wow!

400
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:20,001
I've never seen one go
like that before...

401
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,948
Target destroyed!

402
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:24,880
Right!

403
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,215
Way to go, Kodai!

404
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,481
Well done. Return to base.
We're about to warp.

405
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,153
Shima, how long?

406
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,629
Five minutes to full charge.

407
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:42,122
Aihara, have you found somewhere
for us to go?

408
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,259
Just about.

409
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:51,937
Kato here. No sign of Mori.
we can't raise her.

410
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,142
What?!

411
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,543
BT1, do you read?

412
00:36:58,851 --> 00:36:59,875
BT1!

413
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:00,680
Do you read?

414
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,454
Yuki Mori!

415
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:06,955
I read you.

416
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:08,851
What's wrong?

417
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:15,032
Oxygen supply very low.
Remedy immediately.

418
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:26,706
The debris took out my engine.

419
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,704
You can't move?

420
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,909
Just leave me here.

421
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:37,685
Don't be stupid! Hang on.

422
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:39,486
There's no time!

423
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:41,516
Return to your post.

424
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:47,693
And leave her
like you did my brother?

425
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,172
I'll be back in time.

426
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,470
Nanbu, take over.

427
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,469
Idiot!

428
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:06,675
Continue with preparations
for warp.

429
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:07,685
Sir!

430
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,953
Aihara, call out the enemy positions
as they move.

431
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,224
Yes, Sir.

432
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:22,829
Mr. Kodai?

433
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:31,509
Two minutes to warp capability.

434
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,113
Emergence point confirmed.

435
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,813
Emergence point clear
of obstructions.

436
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,984
It's all right.

437
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:51,893
Suffocation doesn't hurt.

438
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:55,257
It's all right. I'm not afraid.

439
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:57,130
I'm not afraid.

440
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:03,541
Yuki Mori,
will your ejection gear work?

441
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:08,042
Do you read me?

442
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,707
Go back!

443
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,774
I'm messing you all up.

444
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,912
Answer me!
Will your ejection gear work?

445
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,852
Yes.

446
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,059
Right.

447
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,292
I'll say when.

448
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:29,858
Five bogeys closing at 9:20!

449
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,033
Fire!

450
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:42,710
Port side, aft!

451
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,511
Sub-nozzle's out!

452
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,879
They rammed us?

453
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,914
Their fighters have nowhere
to go back to.

454
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,118
Gamilas!

455
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:53,954
Where?

456
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,823
Large squadron approaching!

457
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:11,273
Damn it!

458
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,942
I'm behind you, Yuki.

459
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,981
Roger.

460
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:31,553
Go!

461
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:47,604
Recharging complete.

462
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,151
20 Gamilas vessels
nearing impact.

463
00:40:55,555 --> 00:40:57,682
There's Mr. Kodai.

464
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,051
Shima...

465
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:05,092
...think of them as missiles.

466
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:11,099
Let them come in close,
then roll sideways to evade.

467
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,134
Roger!

468
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:16,800
Brace for lateral gs.

469
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:20,075
We will evade...

470
00:41:20,513 --> 00:41:24,745
...then take Kodai aboard
while the Gamilas are turning.

471
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:26,718
Then we will warp.

472
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:31,452
Hey! What's going on?!

473
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:37,788
Readying for evasive action.
All personnel prepare for g-force.

474
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,762
Five seconds to impact point!

475
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:44,895
Four...

476
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,160
Three...

477
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:47,596
Evading!

478
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,047
Open entry port!

479
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:01,646
He's in!

480
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:02,779
Warp!

481
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:17,195
Her heart's stopped!

482
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:19,665
Where's Dr. Sado?

483
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,297
Coming.

484
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:23,769
Yuki...

485
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,936
Yuki!

486
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:33,016
I'll defibrillate. Keep going.

487
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:38,251
Yuki! Don't die on me!

488
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,058
Damn it!

489
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:49,159
Doctor!

490
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:50,134
Stretcher!

491
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,001
Lift her. 1, 2, 3...

492
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,104
Let's go.

493
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:20,262
Your actions endangered this ship.
That is a serious offence.

494
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:27,139
That is how I do things.

495
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:32,007
I will not stand back and watch
my subordinates die.

496
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:34,836
Throw him in the brig!

497
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:42,921
I'll come quietly!

498
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:53,654
Move!

499
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,571
You still like it in the brig, Huh?

500
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:11,482
Chief Tokugawa...

501
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:13,949
It's been a while.

502
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,513
You're in the brig already?
You never change.

503
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:23,852
Just for doing what I think is right.
Why does this happen?

504
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:26,194
You're two of a kind.

505
00:44:28,868 --> 00:44:35,000
You're just like your older brother
when he was young.

506
00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:37,642
I'm like who?

507
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:42,775
Fiery, a loose cannon,
but cool under pressure.

508
00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:49,487
You know, Kodai,
You just might be cut out...

509
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:52,787
...to be a ship's captain yourself.

510
00:44:57,964 --> 00:45:00,990
Whoever you're saying I'm like now,
My way and a certain someone's...

511
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:04,025
...are completely opposite.

512
00:45:05,304 --> 00:45:06,794
Oh yeah?

513
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:13,578
I was about to say you're a lot like
Captain Okita when he was young.

514
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:22,176
Anyway, I guess we'll find out.
If we survive, that is.

515
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:27,523
Look who's here!

516
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,891
Hello, Doctor.

517
00:45:28,928 --> 00:45:31,123
Doctor, how's Mori?

518
00:45:31,964 --> 00:45:34,194
Fine. Just a few scratches.

519
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:35,530
Thank you.

520
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:36,830
Let's have a drink.

521
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:37,836
Great!

522
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:49,743
You should be grateful to the captain.
He took a big chance.

523
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:53,684
He was in a very tight spot
and he hung in to the last.

524
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:58,216
He did?

525
00:45:59,692 --> 00:46:03,719
You realize
in that battle off mars...

526
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:07,699
...You're not the only one
who lost someone.

527
00:46:12,538 --> 00:46:14,233
Is this a sermon?

528
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:20,103
Did you know that the Fuyuzuki
didn't come back, either?

529
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:28,882
Captain Okita's son
was its navigator.

530
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:59,910
This is the Captain.

531
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,547
We are about to leave
the solar system.

532
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:11,628
We are heading out into a realm
where no human being has ever been.

533
00:47:11,764 --> 00:47:15,666
Communication with earth
will be impossible.

534
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:20,669
Thus today
all hands will have access...

535
00:47:20,706 --> 00:47:23,197
...to communications.

536
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,706
This could be your last message
to earth.

537
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:32,516
I ask you all to take proper leave
of your families.

538
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,754
I'm like Okita? Me?

539
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:48,791
Yeah, Right!

540
00:47:50,703 --> 00:47:52,762
You have one minute.

541
00:47:53,072 --> 00:47:56,872
The channel
will then shut down.

542
00:47:57,543 --> 00:48:00,944
Think what you want to say
before you go in.

543
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:18,794
Enter lD number.

544
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:26,127
What I want to say?

545
00:48:28,474 --> 00:48:30,066
There's dad!

546
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:33,768
How are you, Jiro?

547
00:48:35,014 --> 00:48:35,912
How are you?

548
00:48:35,948 --> 00:48:38,109
Oh, I'm fine.

549
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:43,582
Make sure you don't catch cold.

550
00:48:43,622 --> 00:48:45,180
I'll be fine.

551
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:47,556
I'll be fine!

552
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:49,891
I'm too stupid to catch a cold.

553
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:54,624
Wrap a towel around your stomach
when you sleep.

554
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,635
You always get the runs.

555
00:48:57,169 --> 00:48:59,034
I'll be back soon.

556
00:49:00,806 --> 00:49:02,831
I miss you.

557
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,813
Don't worry. I'll be back,
with that radiation device.

558
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,487
Promise?

559
00:49:17,223 --> 00:49:18,485
I promise!

560
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:20,891
Jiro...

561
00:49:20,926 --> 00:49:22,689
Channel closed.

562
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:34,570
Do you have your hachiman amulet?
It'll keep the bullets away.

563
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:36,634
Yep.

564
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,443
I have it.

565
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:43,271
And don't forget...

566
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,075
Channel closed.

567
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,155
You worry too much.

568
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:57,460
287, 288...

569
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:00,796
...289, 290...

570
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,267
What?

571
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:06,101
You're doing sit-ups here?

572
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:08,666
So?

573
00:50:10,977 --> 00:50:14,242
You're last on the list
to send a message.

574
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:18,480
A message?

575
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:22,182
Input your lD number first.
You have one minute.

576
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:23,246
Id number?

577
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,021
That one there.

578
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:27,284
This one?

579
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:28,518
Yes.

580
00:50:28,995 --> 00:50:30,155
Mr. Kodai!

581
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,263
How are you?

582
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:33,758
Hey!

583
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,928
I'm kidding, Ando.
You're here, too?

584
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:41,066
Yes. Assigned to 3rd bridge!

585
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,005
Yeah?

586
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:50,614
Be seeing you.

587
00:50:51,685 --> 00:50:56,987
My parents are fine.
I swore I'd be back.

588
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:03,186
Wait here.

589
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,554
Roger.

590
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:18,010
So you're ok? Great.

591
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:21,547
I won't thank you.

592
00:51:24,618 --> 00:51:29,180
I'd rather have died
than endanger this ship.

593
00:51:34,561 --> 00:51:38,964
Look, could you just
go a little easier?

594
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,630
Relax a bit.

595
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:44,633
You owe me one.

596
00:51:45,071 --> 00:51:46,902
What's that?

597
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,964
Gotcha.

598
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:07,560
Enter lD number.

599
00:52:23,943 --> 00:52:25,877
You're drinking?

600
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:27,939
You're ok?

601
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:30,006
I'm fine.

602
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:32,746
You saw Kodai?

603
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:37,621
By the message room.

604
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:41,559
He's talking to his family now.

605
00:52:41,594 --> 00:52:44,563
His family? Who?

606
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:48,559
Weren't you in Team Kodai?

607
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:54,198
Yes, but he quit just after
I was assigned there.

608
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,176
Then I was posted,
so I'm not really one of them.

609
00:52:58,645 --> 00:52:59,703
I see.

610
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:04,242
I only ever joined the force
because I admired Susumu Kodai...

611
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:07,579
...the "Cosmo Zero" ace.

612
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:13,789
So I guess I feel
kind of sold out.

613
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:18,224
Don't tell him that

614
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:22,458
Well, the reason he quit...

615
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:23,992
Yes?

616
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:30,967
A message to my family...

617
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,879
When the Gamilas started bombing...

618
00:53:35,915 --> 00:53:38,884
...we used to go up after them.

619
00:53:39,953 --> 00:53:43,548
The bombs were more fragile,
so we destroyed some...

620
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,990
...and knocked a few off course.

621
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:48,750
I know. It was famous.

622
00:53:49,763 --> 00:53:53,529
He was the ace,
and I wasn't too bad, either.

623
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,869
So one day we diverted a bomb,
and saved the planet again.

624
00:53:58,905 --> 00:54:00,930
We were delighted.

625
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:07,546
But this time the story
had a different ending.

626
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:15,151
I guess you're my family.

627
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,624
So how've you been?

628
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:25,023
Don't start crying, Mr. Kodai.
You'll mess me up, too.

629
00:54:25,064 --> 00:54:27,157
What are you talking about?

630
00:54:29,702 --> 00:54:34,765
The bomb we diverted
crashed into space station 2.

631
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:37,300
Oh, that...

632
00:54:39,312 --> 00:54:43,646
And to make things worse,
his parents were living there...

633
00:54:43,683 --> 00:54:46,208
...and so was my pregnant wife.

634
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:52,989
They managed to save the child,
but he's never been able to talk.

635
00:54:56,996 --> 00:55:00,557
Kodai left the force right after that.

636
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:07,768
Channel closed.

637
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:53,878
The space battleship Yamato
heads for the large magellanic cloud...

638
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,083
...to the planet lskandar...

639
00:55:57,123 --> 00:56:00,251
...to obtain an anti-radiation device
said to exist there.

640
00:56:03,963 --> 00:56:08,024
All clear ahead. No gravity field.
Warp successful.

641
00:56:11,804 --> 00:56:13,635
Bogey! It's a Gamilas fighter!

642
00:56:13,673 --> 00:56:15,470
One?

643
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:16,202
Yes.

644
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:17,732
It's shut down.

645
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,444
It's not attacking.

646
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:22,539
No?

647
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:24,213
I'll bring it up.

648
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:30,823
Did it warp with us?

649
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,585
Kodai...

650
00:56:34,761 --> 00:56:37,696
Bring it aboard.

651
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:41,299
We'll analyze it.

652
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:42,993
Roger.

653
00:56:48,241 --> 00:56:49,640
Captain!

654
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:51,906
Call sick bay!

655
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:53,105
Take over!

656
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:54,738
Captain!

657
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:18,032
Well, Doctor?

658
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:24,777
It's progressing.

659
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,880
So how long
do you think I've got?

660
00:57:34,153 --> 00:57:38,055
Soon those won't suppress it
any more.

661
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,265
Will I make it?

662
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:16,526
It might be unmanned.
Where's the cockpit?

663
00:58:16,563 --> 00:58:19,088
I've never seen one this way.

664
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:21,931
You've seen lots of them.

665
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,604
Always through a canopy.

666
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:29,735
No signs of life.

667
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:31,608
Is it a drone?

668
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:32,943
Saito...

669
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,716
Take a fuselage sample.
be careful, quick, and accurate.

670
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:40,278
As the tech officer says...

671
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,850
..."Careful, Quick, and accurate".

672
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:51,223
Fire!

673
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,558
Right! Right!

674
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:58,863
Left! Go Left! Fire! Fire!

675
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,866
Mr. Sanada!

676
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,000
Saito!

677
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,972
Saito!

678
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:40,202
Fight it!

679
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:43,614
Get the doctor!

680
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:44,639
Right!

681
00:59:45,552 --> 00:59:46,484
Hey!

682
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:03,126
Crew of the Yamato...

683
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:05,965
The earth is...

684
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:09,099
...ours.

685
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:13,569
Who are you?

686
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,615
Desla.

687
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:20,778
Desla?

688
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:27,589
You call us "Gamilas".

689
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:34,000
Is that crystal thing you?

690
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:37,695
Yes, and No.

691
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,169
We are both individuals,
and one being.

692
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:50,207
As if we were Alpha and Omega.

693
01:00:58,692 --> 01:01:00,819
Why are you attacking earth?

694
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:05,755
Attacking?

695
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:12,829
We are renovating it.

696
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,672
Saito?

697
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:22,710
Saito!

698
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:37,622
Don't shoot!

699
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:47,302
That hurt!

700
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,835
Sorry.

701
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:54,210
But it takes that much power
to shut down your life functions.

702
01:01:54,248 --> 01:01:56,682
Thanks a heap!

703
01:01:56,717 --> 01:02:00,050
Level 2 on a pulse gun
could stop a bear!

704
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:05,253
Then I guess level 2
was the right choice.

705
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:12,695
It still hurt!

706
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:16,129
But anyone other than you
would be in sick bay now.

707
01:02:16,169 --> 01:02:17,830
And it brought you back.

708
01:02:22,509 --> 01:02:24,875
For that, I thank you.

709
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:27,979
You owe me one.

710
01:02:28,615 --> 01:02:29,479
Ok...

711
01:02:29,816 --> 01:02:30,805
What?

712
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:36,121
And so...I will buy you a beer.

713
01:02:36,156 --> 01:02:37,748
Cheapskate!

714
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:58,206
Kodai reporting.

715
01:02:58,945 --> 01:02:59,843
Come in.

716
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,844
Excuse me.

717
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:20,497
Yes, Sir?

718
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,267
Kodai...

719
01:03:31,578 --> 01:03:33,273
How do you like the ship?

720
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:40,819
I've never served on a battleship,
so I can't compare...

721
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:43,020
...but she's a fine ship.

722
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:59,672
What did you wish to discuss?

723
01:04:03,577 --> 01:04:04,737
Kodai...

724
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:12,013
...would you take over
as Acting Captain?

725
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:14,951
Sir?

726
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:23,091
I'd hoped Mamoru Kodai
would succeed me as captain.

727
01:04:24,097 --> 01:04:25,530
My brother?

728
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:30,498
You have it in you
just like he did.

729
01:04:31,772 --> 01:04:34,240
You belong in charge.

730
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:37,271
Well?

731
01:04:37,477 --> 01:04:38,535
No, Thank you.

732
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:41,172
I couldn't do it.

733
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:43,608
Not me.

734
01:04:45,952 --> 01:04:48,512
Not the way you do.

735
01:04:52,225 --> 01:04:55,490
No? That's too bad.

736
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:57,020
Excuse me.

737
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:58,663
Kodai...

738
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:03,728
There is no need to emulate me.

739
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:06,836
Do it your way.

740
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:15,780
All right, in that case...

741
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:26,219
...I will put it in the form
of an order.

742
01:05:27,994 --> 01:05:31,555
This is the captain.
Attention all hands.

743
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:39,563
Effective immediately, Susumu Kodai
is Acting Captain. That is all.

744
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:40,970
Dismissed.

745
01:05:47,013 --> 01:05:47,945
Scramble!

746
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:52,645
Gamilas attack confirmed.
All personnel to battle stations.

747
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,747
You're captain?
Where are you going?

748
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:56,721
The hangar!

749
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,127
When did it start?

750
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:12,230
I don't know. We noticed it
a few minutes ago.

751
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:15,105
It's transmitting something.

752
01:06:20,013 --> 01:06:21,037
an SOS?

753
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:21,945
No.

754
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:25,918
Our location.
They're using that to attack.

755
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,088
Mr. Sanada, Take over here.

756
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:31,090
Black Tigers, Scramble!

757
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,093
Destroy that thing!

758
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:44,664
There'll be more.

759
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:46,797
Where are they?

760
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,001
Third wave approaching!

761
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:50,832
What?

762
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:52,174
Shima, evade!

763
01:07:05,726 --> 01:07:06,852
Damage?

764
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:09,654
We're hit around 3rd bridge.

765
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:12,891
Crew members trapped.

766
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:13,997
Oxygen?

767
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:19,595
They're ok for a while.

768
01:07:20,107 --> 01:07:23,804
Send a rescue squad.
Get me 3rd bridge.

769
01:07:23,844 --> 01:07:24,902
Yes, Sir!

770
01:07:27,848 --> 01:07:30,840
The elevator shaft's hit!

771
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:33,945
Mr. Kodai, it's Ando.
We're trapped!

772
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:37,014
We have wounded.
Send medics!

773
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:42,490
This is Acting Captain Kodai.
a rescue squad is on the way.

774
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,499
We'll get you out of there.

775
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:49,833
Hang in, Ando.
They'll be there soon.

776
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:51,832
Yes, Sir.

777
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:55,870
Where are they?

778
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,810
Bogeys at 3 o'clock.

779
01:07:57,845 --> 01:08:00,541
Shima, 90 degrees starboard.

780
01:08:02,483 --> 01:08:05,213
Charge wave-motion gun.

781
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:07,447
Charging.

782
01:08:07,488 --> 01:08:09,649
Raising scope.

783
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:17,464
Target: large enemy gunship.

784
01:08:17,498 --> 01:08:19,056
on trajectory.

785
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:22,736
Locking.

786
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,201
Range 60.

787
01:08:29,143 --> 01:08:32,544
Energy at 120 per cent.

788
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,744
Ten seconds to wave gun.

789
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:41,716
All hands brace for shock and flash.

790
01:08:46,093 --> 01:08:46,889
Five...

791
01:08:47,161 --> 01:08:48,059
Four...

792
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:54,026
Firing!

793
01:09:16,991 --> 01:09:20,586
Gunboat destroyed.
The enemy fleet is gone!

794
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,894
Kodai!

795
01:09:27,268 --> 01:09:28,826
Impulse from below!

796
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:30,063
Below?!

797
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:39,911
Energy rising! It's going to explode!

798
01:09:40,214 --> 01:09:41,738
Clear 3rd bridge!

799
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:42,612
We can't!

800
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:43,878
We'll blow up!

801
01:09:43,918 --> 01:09:45,078
Passing limit!

802
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:45,983
Kodai!

803
01:10:04,271 --> 01:10:06,831
Yuki, take out...

804
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:10,175
...the 3rd bridge.

805
01:10:15,216 --> 01:10:16,649
That's an order!

806
01:10:20,187 --> 01:10:21,051
Fire!

807
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,087
Roger.

808
01:11:14,074 --> 01:11:18,204
It was a stealth craft.
The radar didn't pick it up.

809
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:23,075
I should have seen it.

810
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:27,615
The six crew on that bridge...

811
01:11:31,525 --> 01:11:33,254
...I let them die.

812
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:38,496
I am not fit to act as captain.

813
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,636
Then why come back?

814
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:52,006
Why did you join up again?

815
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,611
To find out
what manner of man you were.

816
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:06,252
to find...

817
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:12,822
...what manner of man
let my brother die.

818
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,767
I see.

819
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:25,907
and...

820
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:31,947
...to see a green earth again.

821
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:37,657
Like it was when I was a boy.

822
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:49,532
I wanted to bring that back.

823
01:12:54,308 --> 01:12:55,866
Tell me...

824
01:12:56,877 --> 01:13:00,677
...as Acting Captain,
what should I have done?

825
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:16,461
Kodai, the result isn't there
for us to brood over.

826
01:13:16,497 --> 01:13:20,900
What we should do
doesn't lie in the past.

827
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:24,764
It's here, right now.

828
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:27,837
You use the people you have.

829
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:31,072
In theory, perhaps,
but I'm not like you.

830
01:13:32,546 --> 01:13:36,915
You can just let a situation
roll off your back.

831
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:42,478
That's not true, Kodai.

832
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:48,220
There was a time
when I was just like you.

833
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,567
If you've never held command
you don't know the pressure.

834
01:13:58,038 --> 01:13:59,505
Right?

835
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:08,543
You're doing a fine job
as Acting Captain.

836
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:13,248
Kodai...

837
01:14:16,023 --> 01:14:17,684
...There's...

838
01:14:21,929 --> 01:14:25,592
...something I have to tell you.

839
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,474
Who is it?

840
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:41,842
Kodai.

841
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:55,019
Why are you here?

842
01:14:58,098 --> 01:14:59,725
To apologize.

843
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:01,565
For what?

844
01:15:01,602 --> 01:15:02,967
That order.

845
01:15:10,744 --> 01:15:12,041
I'm sorry.

846
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:16,006
Why apologize?

847
01:15:17,718 --> 01:15:19,913
There's no need.

848
01:15:22,956 --> 01:15:27,256
You simply did what you had to
as Acting Captain.

849
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:31,727
And an order is an order,
even if...

850
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:35,592
...it means...

851
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:43,675
...shooting at...

852
01:15:48,116 --> 01:15:49,913
...your own people...

853
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:08,960
I'm sorry.

854
01:16:20,915 --> 01:16:23,509
I'm sorry I lost it.

855
01:16:26,054 --> 01:16:27,954
I didn't mean...

856
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:45,228
That's fine.

857
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:50,803
Don't say any more.

858
01:17:08,763 --> 01:17:13,996
Prepare to enter warp.

859
01:17:33,521 --> 01:17:34,749
Iskandar!

860
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:38,956
It's in sight!

861
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,544
So that's...

862
01:18:00,682 --> 01:18:02,115
... Iskandar...

863
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:13,850
Missiles at 12 o'clock!
about 60! Range 500!

864
01:18:13,895 --> 01:18:16,625
They're coming from lskandar!

865
01:18:16,664 --> 01:18:17,961
The gun's not charged!

866
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:19,227
I know!

867
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:22,858
Stations!

868
01:18:26,674 --> 01:18:31,236
They've split into four groups,
port, starboard, above, below.

869
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:33,543
All guns lock on targets!

870
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:38,244
Ten seconds!

871
01:18:38,453 --> 01:18:40,580
All guns...fire!

872
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:49,963
Large missile! 10 seconds to impact!

873
01:19:06,047 --> 01:19:07,173
It didn't explode!

874
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:10,209
Damage report!

875
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:13,013
Sir! The wave gun!

876
01:19:13,054 --> 01:19:14,544
What about it?

877
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:18,248
The muzzle's been blocked!

878
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:23,956
What?!

879
01:19:28,736 --> 01:19:30,533
Enemy fleet ahead!

880
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:36,534
Fix that wave gun!
Ready all other guns!

881
01:19:41,749 --> 01:19:43,444
They'll wear us down.

882
01:19:43,985 --> 01:19:48,479
Missiles, second wave.
Impact in 30 seconds.

883
01:19:48,523 --> 01:19:51,219
There's too many to take out!

884
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,822
Warp us out of here.

885
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:55,954
Where to?

886
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:57,555
Anywhere!

887
01:19:57,598 --> 01:19:58,929
It won't work!

888
01:19:58,966 --> 01:19:59,933
Incoming!

889
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,802
Shima!

890
01:20:26,494 --> 01:20:27,791
Kodai!

891
01:20:28,763 --> 01:20:32,631
If there'd been anything here,
We'd have been obliterated!

892
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:36,501
We would have been anyway!

893
01:20:41,743 --> 01:20:42,801
Where are we?

894
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:46,811
Still near lskandar.

895
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:49,877
Look!

896
01:20:57,525 --> 01:21:02,861
Is that the same planet
as before?

897
01:21:07,769 --> 01:21:13,264
Affirmative.
We're behind lskandar now.

898
01:21:13,975 --> 01:21:16,239
It looks just like earth!

899
01:21:31,893 --> 01:21:33,451
It's Gamilas.

900
01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:34,586
What?

901
01:21:35,997 --> 01:21:38,056
This was a Gamilas missile.

902
01:21:39,767 --> 01:21:43,533
Have we come to Gamilas
instead of lskandar?

903
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:47,737
I'll bet this is a trap.

904
01:21:47,775 --> 01:21:49,504
A trap?

905
01:21:49,544 --> 01:21:51,102
A Gamilas trap.

906
01:21:52,013 --> 01:21:55,972
Iskandar, the radiation device,
all lies.

907
01:21:56,484 --> 01:21:58,179
We've been had!

908
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,215
Why would they do that?

909
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:05,125
To lure us away.

910
01:22:07,595 --> 01:22:12,828
Maybe the radiation device
Was just a story.

911
01:22:14,702 --> 01:22:19,230
There was nothing about it
in that capsule I analyzed.

912
01:22:19,273 --> 01:22:23,004
Only directions here
and plans for the wave-motion engine.

913
01:22:23,978 --> 01:22:25,275
Meaning?

914
01:22:27,081 --> 01:22:32,178
Someone might have made up
the radiation-device story.

915
01:22:33,054 --> 01:22:37,013
Why? Why would they do that?

916
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:41,060
Why did we come here?

917
01:22:43,731 --> 01:22:46,632
Was the captain lying?

918
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:51,605
Never! Captain Okita wouldn't do that.

919
01:22:51,973 --> 01:22:53,235
I'll go ask him.

920
01:22:53,274 --> 01:22:56,243
No! This isn't the time.

921
01:22:56,911 --> 01:22:58,003
It's that bad?

922
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:02,807
I'll go.

923
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:03,874
Saito!

924
01:23:04,585 --> 01:23:07,554
He's the only one
who knows the truth, right?

925
01:23:09,957 --> 01:23:12,585
We need to ask him now!

926
01:23:13,094 --> 01:23:15,289
Our fate rides on it!

927
01:23:15,496 --> 01:23:18,795
Doesn't it, "Acting Captain"?

928
01:23:23,704 --> 01:23:25,865
We'll go down there.

929
01:23:26,807 --> 01:23:32,040
The message gave coordinate points.
We might learn something there.

930
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:33,842
Kodai! Are you crazy?!

931
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:35,610
We walk into their arms?

932
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:40,110
If this was a trap,
why would they attack us now?

933
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:47,922
There must be a reason
they don't want us going down there.

934
01:23:50,665 --> 01:23:55,796
And anyway, there were directions
and an engine plan in that capsule.

935
01:23:56,137 --> 01:24:02,007
We have to go to those coordinates
and find out what this is all about.

936
01:24:04,011 --> 01:24:06,809
The captain believed that message.

937
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:09,746
And l...

938
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:14,718
...believe in him.

939
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:20,017
He would not lie
about his feelings for earth.

940
01:24:25,232 --> 01:24:26,790
Mr. Sanada...

941
01:24:30,037 --> 01:24:31,026
Yuki...

942
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,007
Saito!

943
01:24:39,247 --> 01:24:40,612
Shima...

944
01:24:43,986 --> 01:24:46,955
Whose ship is this, anyway?

945
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:54,588
The 8th of the coordinates
we were sent indicate...

946
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:58,896
...a point below the surface
of lskandar/Gamilas, here.

947
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:02,032
Our mission is to go there.

948
01:25:02,504 --> 01:25:05,667
Landing will be
the black tigers, the paratroopers...

949
01:25:05,707 --> 01:25:08,608
...tech officer Sanada,
and myself.

950
01:25:09,645 --> 01:25:11,010
Why you, Sir?

951
01:25:13,248 --> 01:25:17,548
Mr. Kodai will go first to knock out
their aerial defense system.

952
01:25:17,586 --> 01:25:18,644
Look.

953
01:25:19,955 --> 01:25:23,220
This is the zone above
the landing point.

954
01:25:23,692 --> 01:25:27,560
An armed, floating defense system.

955
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:30,090
We'll have to slip through it.

956
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:32,859
Impossible!

957
01:25:32,901 --> 01:25:34,960
Not for the Cosmo Zero.

958
01:25:35,604 --> 01:25:39,802
It predates the Gamilas attack,
and has stealth capacity.

959
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:44,505
But Gamilas will detect
as soon as you use the engine.

960
01:25:46,548 --> 01:25:48,982
I'll be gliding in.

961
01:25:57,025 --> 01:25:59,755
The black tigers attack on my order.

962
01:26:00,062 --> 01:26:04,931
You'll escort the troop carrier down.
Proceed with caution.

963
01:26:05,233 --> 01:26:07,258
They could be anywhere.

964
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:13,532
Can one Cosmo zero take out
a whole defense system?

965
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:26,586
Attention all personnel.
This is Acting Captain Kodai.

966
01:26:28,857 --> 01:26:30,620
Our landing...

967
01:26:31,226 --> 01:26:34,957
...on lskandar/Gamilas
is about to commence.

968
01:26:37,099 --> 01:26:40,865
This will probably be the last battle
in our long journey...

969
01:26:40,902 --> 01:26:44,599
...of 148,000 light-years.

970
01:26:49,945 --> 01:26:55,212
In April of 1945,
the battleship Yamato...

971
01:26:56,251 --> 01:27:00,881
...Set sail to bring a ray of hope
into a time of utter despair.

972
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:03,682
We do the same.

973
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,927
The coordinates we were sent
may be a trap.

974
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:16,264
We may only be playing
into the enemy's hands.

975
01:27:16,304 --> 01:27:21,765
But as long as there is
one faint ray of light in the dark...

976
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:27,942
...as long as we have even a chance,
We must go forward.

977
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:33,112
That is the destiny
of any ship named Yamato.

978
01:27:34,189 --> 01:27:38,717
And that is the mission
we have been assigned.

979
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:44,929
I ask you all to remember that.

980
01:27:49,304 --> 01:27:51,465
Let us win this fight!

981
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:56,067
and transform a faint chance
into real hope!

982
01:27:57,813 --> 01:28:00,213
For those we have left on earth...

983
01:28:02,818 --> 01:28:07,983
No...for the families we love...

984
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:11,625
...Let us make earth green again!

985
01:28:13,762 --> 01:28:15,627
For this ship...

986
01:28:24,506 --> 01:28:25,734
...and for Captain Okita.

987
01:28:29,211 --> 01:28:32,647
...I ask you all to give
everything you have!

988
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,160
We'll take the left wing.

989
01:28:48,196 --> 01:28:49,356
Mr. Kodai!

990
01:29:00,075 --> 01:29:01,269
Right!

991
01:29:01,309 --> 01:29:04,210
It's our turn at last!

992
01:29:06,414 --> 01:29:07,438
Work!

993
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:09,616
Do it right!

994
01:29:10,418 --> 01:29:11,976
To lskandar!

995
01:29:13,488 --> 01:29:16,389
You probably won't make it back.

996
01:29:20,395 --> 01:29:23,421
That's all we need to get us going!

997
01:29:24,966 --> 01:29:26,456
See you there.

998
01:29:48,924 --> 01:29:51,688
I haven't been here for a while.

999
01:29:51,726 --> 01:29:54,923
Well, I'm counting on you.

1000
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:56,554
Roger.

1001
01:30:09,811 --> 01:30:10,903
What?

1002
01:30:10,946 --> 01:30:13,210
Are you going to show off?

1003
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,778
Who are you to talk?

1004
01:30:18,653 --> 01:30:20,450
Don't mess up, Ok?

1005
01:30:28,863 --> 01:30:32,458
Launching CZ1.

1006
01:30:59,327 --> 01:31:04,663
Mr. Kodai, what was all that about
with Ms Yuki?

1007
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:10,232
All I needed to get me going.

1008
01:31:44,406 --> 01:31:47,500
8,000 meters to surface.

1009
01:31:47,876 --> 01:31:48,934
7,000...

1010
01:31:49,444 --> 01:31:50,706
6,000...

1011
01:31:51,046 --> 01:31:51,910
5,000...

1012
01:31:52,547 --> 01:31:55,175
Not yet not yet not yet...

1013
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:56,148
Go!

1014
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:09,590
Uh-oh...

1015
01:32:16,304 --> 01:32:17,771
Shima!

1016
01:32:24,546 --> 01:32:26,207
Come back alive.

1017
01:32:27,015 --> 01:32:29,415
Right! Time to warp!

1018
01:32:34,989 --> 01:32:35,853
You ok?

1019
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,517
We're all here!

1020
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:49,934
Mr. Kodai...I'll be top scorer today.

1021
01:32:52,207 --> 01:32:54,903
Whatever. You still mope.

1022
01:32:55,276 --> 01:32:57,039
No, I don't!

1023
01:32:57,745 --> 01:32:58,871
Furuya!

1024
01:32:59,447 --> 01:33:01,381
They're above us!

1025
01:33:30,913 --> 01:33:33,507
They're all around the carrier!

1026
01:33:33,549 --> 01:33:34,379
Roger.

1027
01:33:49,965 --> 01:33:51,057
Yamamoto...

1028
01:33:57,206 --> 01:33:58,969
Yamamoto!

1029
01:34:02,578 --> 01:34:04,478
Enemy destroyed!

1030
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:09,007
There's three of us left
with the troop carrier.

1031
01:34:10,886 --> 01:34:12,217
Roger.

1032
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:20,292
Arriving at coordinate point.

1033
01:34:26,068 --> 01:34:27,626
It's beautiful...

1034
01:34:32,575 --> 01:34:35,703
The coordinate point is in there.

1035
01:34:36,512 --> 01:34:39,413
All units land.

1036
01:34:50,759 --> 01:34:52,158
Fire!

1037
01:34:52,628 --> 01:34:54,061
Yuki, quick!

1038
01:34:56,265 --> 01:34:57,232
Saito!

1039
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:03,461
Move out!

1040
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:05,665
Right!

1041
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:20,118
Damn it!

1042
01:35:20,456 --> 01:35:23,482
There's hundreds of them!

1043
01:35:32,968 --> 01:35:36,335
Analyzer! Stand-alone mode!
Cover us!

1044
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,797
Leave it to me.

1045
01:35:57,159 --> 01:35:57,784
Hurry.

1046
01:35:58,127 --> 01:35:59,958
Cover me!

1047
01:36:06,035 --> 01:36:08,230
Hey! Hey!

1048
01:36:19,948 --> 01:36:22,439
Make it back to earth, Mr....

1049
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:24,551
Analyzer!

1050
01:36:31,593 --> 01:36:32,685
I'm sorry.

1051
01:36:53,615 --> 01:36:54,445
Quick!

1052
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,721
I'll hold here!

1053
01:37:10,032 --> 01:37:11,158
Kato!

1054
01:37:12,267 --> 01:37:17,500
I probably won't hold it very long.
Hurry.

1055
01:37:19,908 --> 01:37:20,875
Move it!

1056
01:37:23,078 --> 01:37:24,010
Go!

1057
01:37:26,448 --> 01:37:27,779
Quick!

1058
01:37:43,632 --> 01:37:45,862
The coordinates point here.

1059
01:37:53,675 --> 01:37:55,643
This is lskandar?

1060
01:37:56,879 --> 01:37:57,743
Yuki...

1061
01:38:03,185 --> 01:38:04,015
Hey...

1062
01:38:07,589 --> 01:38:09,352
Yuki!

1063
01:38:12,694 --> 01:38:15,162
We have awaited you.

1064
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,833
Yuki?

1065
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:23,465
Saito went the same way.

1066
01:38:23,505 --> 01:38:26,941
So the lskandar story was true?

1067
01:38:27,309 --> 01:38:30,938
That is the name one of you gave it.

1068
01:38:34,716 --> 01:38:39,210
Yes...a man named Okita.

1069
01:38:39,855 --> 01:38:41,220
What?!

1070
01:38:42,357 --> 01:38:43,449
I knew it!

1071
01:38:45,894 --> 01:38:47,054
Kodai...

1072
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,825
...there's...

1073
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:53,293
...something i have to tell you.

1074
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:58,506
That story about
a radiation device on lskandar...

1075
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:01,771
... isn't true.

1076
01:39:08,283 --> 01:39:10,080
What's going on?!

1077
01:39:10,118 --> 01:39:15,886
We were sent coordinates,
and schematics.

1078
01:39:16,658 --> 01:39:18,285
That's all.

1079
01:39:18,894 --> 01:39:20,759
Why the story?

1080
01:39:22,531 --> 01:39:24,362
Because of you.

1081
01:39:25,701 --> 01:39:26,929
Me?

1082
01:39:27,669 --> 01:39:31,765
You survived a high dosage
of radiation.

1083
01:39:32,574 --> 01:39:36,305
That has been kept secret.

1084
01:39:37,713 --> 01:39:40,705
I took a gamble...

1085
01:39:41,283 --> 01:39:44,480
...that the sender of the capsule...

1086
01:39:46,421 --> 01:39:48,855
...could eliminate radiation.

1087
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:57,727
So with no guarantee of anything...

1088
01:39:59,201 --> 01:40:01,761
...we're going to lskandar?

1089
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:03,699
That's right.

1090
01:40:09,077 --> 01:40:10,203
But...

1091
01:40:15,317 --> 01:40:17,877
...we have hope and a chance.

1092
01:40:22,724 --> 01:40:28,026
You came on board this ship
hoping for something, right?

1093
01:40:32,501 --> 01:40:35,061
And our chances aren't zero.

1094
01:40:37,673 --> 01:40:42,406
You're here right now, alive.

1095
01:40:51,019 --> 01:40:54,045
That in itself is a chance.

1096
01:40:56,725 --> 01:40:59,421
We are a more evolved race...

1097
01:40:59,494 --> 01:41:02,361
...sharing a single conscious mind.

1098
01:41:02,397 --> 01:41:06,299
One manifestation
of this shared consciousness...

1099
01:41:06,335 --> 01:41:08,667
...you call "Gamilas".

1100
01:41:08,704 --> 01:41:13,141
Another manifestation
you call "lskandar".

1101
01:41:14,543 --> 01:41:19,981
Gamilas and lskandar exist
as two sides of the same coin.

1102
01:41:22,884 --> 01:41:27,287
Our planet is about to disintegrate.

1103
01:41:27,723 --> 01:41:32,456
Iskandar accepts this,
and is resigned to vanishing with it.

1104
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:37,193
But Gamilas wishes
to eliminate all earthlings...

1105
01:41:37,232 --> 01:41:42,260
...and render your planet
fit for us to move to.

1106
01:41:43,772 --> 01:41:46,366
Iskandar opposes this.

1107
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:50,474
Gamilas has separated from us,
and enclosed us in here.

1108
01:41:52,014 --> 01:41:56,713
That small fragment of lskandar
that remains in Gamilas...

1109
01:41:56,752 --> 01:41:59,880
...we secretly sent to earth.

1110
01:42:01,289 --> 01:42:03,120
That capsule?

1111
01:42:05,795 --> 01:42:10,789
And eliminating radiation?
That's what we came for.

1112
01:42:13,136 --> 01:42:15,070
Have no fear.

1113
01:42:15,738 --> 01:42:19,265
There is no such device...

1114
01:42:19,308 --> 01:42:22,471
...but I can fulfill its function...

1115
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:26,478
...as you have experienced.

1116
01:42:35,224 --> 01:42:40,252
Prove it. Show us
you can really do that.

1117
01:42:40,296 --> 01:42:42,457
We want to be sure!

1118
01:42:52,742 --> 01:42:55,939
This area is clear of radiation.

1119
01:42:56,813 --> 01:42:59,646
You can now breathe its air.

1120
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,435
It's ok.

1121
01:43:29,479 --> 01:43:32,004
I will grant your wish.

1122
01:43:32,582 --> 01:43:37,144
My energy should be sufficient.

1123
01:43:43,192 --> 01:43:44,420
Yuki!

1124
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,929
I'm fine.

1125
01:43:57,406 --> 01:43:58,839
It's fine.

1126
01:44:09,318 --> 01:44:10,250
Wait!

1127
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,812
Mr. Sanada!

1128
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:27,461
From the energy,
I'd say that's the Gamilas source.

1129
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:30,734
We can stop the attacks.

1130
01:44:37,413 --> 01:44:38,437
Bastards!

1131
01:44:39,415 --> 01:44:40,848
Let's do it!

1132
01:44:44,854 --> 01:44:46,116
Kodai...

1133
01:44:46,589 --> 01:44:49,114
I'll take it out. Cover me.

1134
01:44:49,158 --> 01:44:50,750
You won't get close!

1135
01:44:50,793 --> 01:44:54,991
Once we get across,
You two leave with the Yamato.

1136
01:44:55,031 --> 01:44:56,225
You're crazy!

1137
01:44:56,265 --> 01:44:57,129
Saito!

1138
01:44:59,769 --> 01:45:01,396
Roger!

1139
01:45:03,639 --> 01:45:05,004
Wait!

1140
01:45:05,374 --> 01:45:07,171
I can't leave you.

1141
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:10,270
Acting Captain!
Stop being a jerk!

1142
01:45:12,849 --> 01:45:13,838
Saito!

1143
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:17,675
That hurt, Damn it!

1144
01:45:17,753 --> 01:45:20,586
The ship can't go without its captain.

1145
01:45:20,656 --> 01:45:21,213
But...

1146
01:45:21,257 --> 01:45:21,882
Kodai!

1147
01:45:26,929 --> 01:45:31,730
You're like a little brother to me.

1148
01:45:42,011 --> 01:45:44,275
Don't look like that.

1149
01:45:49,819 --> 01:45:52,049
Be a great captain.

1150
01:45:55,591 --> 01:45:56,649
Let's go!

1151
01:45:56,692 --> 01:45:58,182
Fix the earth.

1152
01:46:00,496 --> 01:46:02,623
I owe you this one.

1153
01:46:05,935 --> 01:46:07,266
Right!

1154
01:46:29,191 --> 01:46:31,819
Quick! Get going, you two!

1155
01:46:33,863 --> 01:46:35,057
Let's go.

1156
01:46:37,833 --> 01:46:39,027
Run!

1157
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,004
Right!

1158
01:47:30,019 --> 01:47:33,978
Careful, quick, and accurate.
come on, tech officer!

1159
01:47:34,724 --> 01:47:37,420
I'm almost done. Hold them off!

1160
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,222
Roger!

1161
01:47:57,246 --> 01:48:02,115
That hurts, Damn it!

1162
01:48:16,432 --> 01:48:18,059
Just a bit more.

1163
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:23,796
Be there for me!

1164
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:31,245
You bastards!

1165
01:48:46,128 --> 01:48:47,493
Oh, no...

1166
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:54,301
It's all right.
My Cosmo Tiger will fly.

1167
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:04,603
Done!

1168
01:49:07,683 --> 01:49:08,650
Saito!

1169
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,789
Saito!

1170
01:50:03,672 --> 01:50:05,037
Let's go home.

1171
01:50:19,855 --> 01:50:24,349
So there was something
for the radiation?

1172
01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:25,858
Yes.

1173
01:50:32,234 --> 01:50:34,202
There really was...

1174
01:50:37,573 --> 01:50:38,471
Yes.

1175
01:50:42,945 --> 01:50:46,972
A future, and a chance...

1176
01:50:47,449 --> 01:50:49,781
...bought with many lives.

1177
01:50:51,054 --> 01:50:55,320
Proceed with caution, Kodai.

1178
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,994
Yes, Sir.

1179
01:51:02,999 --> 01:51:05,297
Entering final warp.

1180
01:51:05,936 --> 01:51:09,201
Earth will be in visual range.

1181
01:51:13,577 --> 01:51:16,512
You'd better go.

1182
01:51:26,623 --> 01:51:27,783
Excuse me.

1183
01:51:36,499 --> 01:51:38,899
All right...

1184
01:51:40,103 --> 01:51:43,903
...Now the duel with death.

1185
01:51:46,543 --> 01:51:48,170
Doctor...

1186
01:51:49,145 --> 01:51:52,239
...Could I be alone for a while?

1187
01:52:04,094 --> 01:52:05,652
Dr. Sado...

1188
01:52:06,997 --> 01:52:08,396
...Thank you.

1189
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,735
Where's earth?

1190
01:52:53,009 --> 01:52:54,033
There.

1191
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:56,703
Where?

1192
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,243
That red planet.

1193
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,514
Yes.

1194
01:53:06,389 --> 01:53:08,050
That's earth!

1195
01:53:08,091 --> 01:53:09,683
Yes!

1196
01:53:12,862 --> 01:53:14,090
It's earth!

1197
01:53:16,533 --> 01:53:18,364
We're back!

1198
01:53:19,069 --> 01:53:20,593
Yamato?

1199
01:53:22,272 --> 01:53:27,710
This is space battleship Yamato.
Acting Captain Kodai and 36 crew.

1200
01:53:27,744 --> 01:53:32,477
We are now 420,000 kilometers
from earth.

1201
01:53:33,116 --> 01:53:36,483
Did you find anything?

1202
01:53:38,254 --> 01:53:40,188
Of course, commander.

1203
01:53:41,191 --> 01:53:45,560
We have the anti-radiation device.

1204
01:53:46,329 --> 01:53:47,887
You do?!

1205
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:51,094
The anti-radiation device...

1206
01:53:54,137 --> 01:53:57,072
There really was one?

1207
01:53:57,107 --> 01:53:58,039
Yes, Sir!

1208
01:54:00,276 --> 01:54:05,111
So Okita won his bet...

1209
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:09,079
Well done.

1210
01:54:10,286 --> 01:54:13,881
Very well done!

1211
01:54:21,197 --> 01:54:22,664
We will soon...

1212
01:54:24,033 --> 01:54:27,127
...be arriving on earth.

1213
01:54:29,773 --> 01:54:31,468
Until then...

1214
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:35,737
... hold out.

1215
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,484
Earth, huh?

1216
01:54:47,824 --> 01:54:52,124
Everyone's always glad...

1217
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:55,159
...to get back.

1218
01:55:22,659 --> 01:55:23,990
What's that?!

1219
01:55:24,761 --> 01:55:28,288
Large Gamilas vessel at 7 o'clock.
We're taking fire!

1220
01:55:28,364 --> 01:55:29,422
Battle stations!

1221
01:55:29,466 --> 01:55:29,989
Roger!

1222
01:55:30,033 --> 01:55:31,728
Damage report!

1223
01:55:32,368 --> 01:55:33,198
Fire crew!

1224
01:55:33,236 --> 01:55:34,464
They're coming!

1225
01:55:43,112 --> 01:55:44,409
Port guns hit!

1226
01:55:44,447 --> 01:55:47,041
The hull won't take this!

1227
01:55:47,083 --> 01:55:48,914
Launchers blocked!

1228
01:55:48,952 --> 01:55:50,579
Turret 2 hit!

1229
01:55:55,124 --> 01:55:57,285
Engine malfunction!

1230
01:55:58,328 --> 01:56:01,559
Tokugawa! How's that engine?

1231
01:56:02,932 --> 01:56:06,561
Mechanical officer! Tokugawa!

1232
01:56:08,271 --> 01:56:10,705
Output reduced...

1233
01:56:11,174 --> 01:56:15,577
...but we can still move.

1234
01:56:16,546 --> 01:56:18,036
Tokugawa?

1235
01:56:19,616 --> 01:56:21,607
Tokugawa!

1236
01:56:52,682 --> 01:56:53,671
Is that...

1237
01:56:55,919 --> 01:56:57,853
...A spaceship?

1238
01:57:02,492 --> 01:57:07,293
So you thought you'd won,
crew of the Yamato?

1239
01:57:10,533 --> 01:57:13,468
And what would be victory?

1240
01:57:13,503 --> 01:57:17,405
Destroying us?

1241
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:22,470
Or returning earth
to its former state?

1242
01:57:25,281 --> 01:57:26,976
Desla...

1243
01:57:28,585 --> 01:57:31,850
Or is it "Gamilas"?

1244
01:57:32,488 --> 01:57:36,447
The answer is both "Yes" and "No".

1245
01:57:37,226 --> 01:57:41,128
Your attack destroyed most of us.

1246
01:57:41,164 --> 01:57:44,622
I am part
of the fragment that remains.

1247
01:57:50,974 --> 01:57:54,171
We have given up
on making earth ours.

1248
01:57:55,044 --> 01:58:00,448
Most of those who would have
moved there have been lost.

1249
01:58:00,483 --> 01:58:04,886
So let us say on that point
the victory is yours.

1250
01:58:05,622 --> 01:58:06,748
But...

1251
01:58:08,191 --> 01:58:11,251
...we will not give you back
your earth.

1252
01:58:12,762 --> 01:58:14,252
What do you mean?

1253
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:20,661
Earth is about to disappear.

1254
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:27,371
You have enraged us.

1255
01:58:28,311 --> 01:58:33,408
We are a race
that does not forget humiliation.

1256
01:58:38,688 --> 01:58:41,953
Life signs negative.

1257
01:58:43,259 --> 01:58:45,420
What's happening?!

1258
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:00,905
What's that?!

1259
01:59:10,153 --> 01:59:14,089
A nuclear reaction.
A huge amount of energy!

1260
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:20,752
It's going to destroy earth!

1261
01:59:21,864 --> 01:59:23,525
Damn him!

1262
01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:30,503
Nanbu, leave that.

1263
01:59:31,307 --> 01:59:32,740
We'll stop him.

1264
01:59:32,775 --> 01:59:34,970
We've got nothing left!

1265
01:59:39,316 --> 01:59:43,275
The wave-motion gun.
Can't we use that yet?!

1266
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,720
The muzzle's blocked!

1267
01:59:46,523 --> 01:59:48,889
It'll blow up.

1268
01:59:49,593 --> 01:59:54,326
There'll be nothing left
of the Yamato!

1269
02:00:18,756 --> 02:00:21,350
I'll go ask the Captain.

1270
02:00:28,632 --> 02:00:29,929
The Captain?

1271
02:00:37,508 --> 02:00:38,907
Oh, No...

1272
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:57,859
Think!

1273
02:00:59,129 --> 02:01:01,063
Think, Kodai!

1274
02:01:02,766 --> 02:01:06,862
Think! There must be a way!

1275
02:01:07,571 --> 02:01:10,631
Think, Kodai! Think!

1276
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,209
Nanbu...

1277
02:01:25,756 --> 02:01:28,350
...do we have energy for the gun?

1278
02:01:31,328 --> 02:01:33,387
Enough for one shot.

1279
02:01:33,997 --> 02:01:37,899
But like I said, if we fire it...

1280
02:01:43,707 --> 02:01:44,901
Mr. Kodai?

1281
02:01:49,012 --> 02:01:54,143
Abandon ship. That is an order
From the Acting Captain.

1282
02:01:54,952 --> 02:01:56,283
You're coming, right?

1283
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:58,948
Did you hear me? That's an order.

1284
02:01:59,857 --> 02:02:01,688
Get going!

1285
02:02:03,393 --> 02:02:06,692
Dr. Sado, Get the wounded.

1286
02:02:11,401 --> 02:02:14,199
Kodai, I'll stay too.

1287
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:15,364
Shima!

1288
02:02:15,906 --> 02:02:18,170
I steer this ship.

1289
02:02:22,613 --> 02:02:24,376
Listen, Shima...

1290
02:02:24,414 --> 02:02:29,579
...the carrier will be unstable.
I'll need you to fly it!

1291
02:02:29,853 --> 02:02:30,911
Kodai!

1292
02:02:30,954 --> 02:02:32,046
Only you...

1293
02:02:32,456 --> 02:02:37,393
...can get Yuki down safely,
and she's the device!

1294
02:02:37,427 --> 02:02:38,155
But...

1295
02:02:38,228 --> 02:02:39,786
I am...

1296
02:02:41,965 --> 02:02:43,796
...Acting Captain.

1297
02:02:47,971 --> 02:02:49,495
I go...

1298
02:02:51,975 --> 02:02:53,636
...with this ship.

1299
02:03:15,065 --> 02:03:16,657
Kodai...

1300
02:03:20,337 --> 02:03:21,668
...Take control.

1301
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:24,329
Roger.

1302
02:03:39,923 --> 02:03:43,051
All hands abandon ship!

1303
02:04:17,694 --> 02:04:21,494
Get going, Yuki.
I'll be right with you.

1304
02:04:25,635 --> 02:04:27,000
I'm staying.

1305
02:04:27,037 --> 02:04:27,969
Yuki!

1306
02:04:28,005 --> 02:04:31,634
If you can bail out,
then so can l!

1307
02:04:38,482 --> 02:04:39,915
Do what you're told!

1308
02:04:39,950 --> 02:04:42,282
But you're lying!

1309
02:04:44,821 --> 02:04:47,085
Life in a world without you...

1310
02:04:48,025 --> 02:04:50,516
...won't mean anything!

1311
02:05:01,838 --> 02:05:03,169
Yuki...

1312
02:05:17,421 --> 02:05:22,415
...I don't have any family left.

1313
02:05:26,363 --> 02:05:28,627
but I met you here.

1314
02:05:32,569 --> 02:05:34,400
I've wanted...

1315
02:05:39,543 --> 02:05:41,010
...to care for you...

1316
02:05:43,713 --> 02:05:45,806
...and show you earth...

1317
02:05:48,051 --> 02:05:49,814
... reborn.

1318
02:05:54,224 --> 02:05:56,624
That's what I've fought for.

1319
02:05:59,996 --> 02:06:02,055
so let me finish the fight.

1320
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:05,461
If we don't win it...

1321
02:06:05,902 --> 02:06:09,338
...everything we've done
will be meaningless!

1322
02:06:14,377 --> 02:06:16,436
If I should die...

1323
02:06:18,515 --> 02:06:20,881
...and earth comes back...

1324
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:25,047
...I'll be alive...

1325
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:30,418
...in every living thing there.

1326
02:06:31,495 --> 02:06:32,325
and so...

1327
02:06:38,368 --> 02:06:40,165
...I'll be with you.

1328
02:06:40,203 --> 02:06:43,661
No! I don't want you to die!

1329
02:06:45,108 --> 02:06:46,735
You can't die!

1330
02:06:47,644 --> 02:06:48,975
Yuki!

1331
02:06:57,521 --> 02:06:58,988
Thank you.

1332
02:07:02,526 --> 02:07:04,391
Goodbye.

1333
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:55,337
Shima...

1334
02:07:57,247 --> 02:07:58,339
Kodai...

1335
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:01,573
Take her.

1336
02:08:03,486 --> 02:08:04,783
All right.

1337
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:25,099
She's a fine ship.

1338
02:08:28,679 --> 02:08:30,544
Don't waste her.

1339
02:09:05,783 --> 02:09:10,117
Evacuating Yamato
with 12 survivors.

1340
02:09:11,956 --> 02:09:14,823
Make sure you get back to earth.

1341
02:09:15,226 --> 02:09:16,454
Roger.

1342
02:09:17,361 --> 02:09:21,627
Yamato will now attempt
to destroy the Gamilas missile.

1343
02:09:22,333 --> 02:09:24,233
Pray for me.

1344
02:09:24,669 --> 02:09:25,761
Kodai!

1345
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:57,927
Mr. Kodai?

1346
02:10:00,037 --> 02:10:01,595
Mr. Kodai!

1347
02:10:04,308 --> 02:10:05,798
Mr. Kodai...

1348
02:10:07,878 --> 02:10:09,675
Mr. Kodai!

1349
02:10:20,124 --> 02:10:22,183
Raising scope.

1350
02:10:25,363 --> 02:10:28,491
Launching Yamato!

1351
02:12:21,612 --> 02:12:24,445
