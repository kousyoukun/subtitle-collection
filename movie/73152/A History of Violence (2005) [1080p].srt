1
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,416
So, we keep
headin' east?

2
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:20,152
Yeah, that's the idea.

3
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,021
Stay out of the big cities?

4
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:23,689
Uh-huh.

5
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:28,628
I think I'm tired.

6
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:31,229
Yeah.

7
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:33,364
Me, too.

8
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,937
Here.

9
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:43,807
Bring it on
up to the office.

10
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,742
I'm going to go
check us out.

11
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,244
All right.

20
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,657
Nothing.

21
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,862
I had a little trouble
with the maid,

22
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:24,665
but everything's
fine now.

23
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:34,007
Damn.

24
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:35,908
8:00.

25
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:38,010
It's already this hot.

26
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,613
Yep.

27
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,882
How are we fixed
for water?

28
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,984
Probably not enough.

29
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,185
Yeah.

30
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,027
There's a cooler
in the back

31
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:59,196
in the office.

32
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,690
Hey.

33
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,838
Shh.

34
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:09,998
Aah! Aah! Aah!

35
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,684
Sarah, honey,
what's wrong?

36
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,652
Huh?

37
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,522
What is it,
sweetie? Hmm?

38
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,023
Daddy.
Yeah?

39
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,859
Daddy.
Daddy's here.

40
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,110
Daddy's here.

41
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,762
There were monsters.

42
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,197
No, sweetie.

43
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:30,033
There's no such thing
as monsters.

44
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:31,785
You were just having
a bad dream.

45
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:32,919
What's wrong, dad?

46
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:35,587
Hi, kiddo.

47
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:38,441
Sarah's just having
a bad dream.

48
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:40,393
Oh.

49
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,528
I saw monsters, Jack.

50
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,279
Monsters?

51
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:45,880
What kind?

52
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,333
I don't know. They came
out of my closet,

53
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,935
and then they were
in the shadows.

54
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:53,104
Mmm, shadow monsters.

55
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:53,988
Well, they look
pretty scary,

56
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,722
but they really
can't do anything,

57
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,390
especially when
the lights are on.

58
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,225
They're scared
of the light.

59
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,095
What happened, baby?

60
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,163
You OK?

61
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,364
I'm OK.

62
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:06,298
Sarah had a bad dream
about monsters.

63
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,299
Oh.

64
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:08,467
And I was telling her

65
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:10,336
that there's no such
thing as monsters.

66
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:11,904
Oh.

67
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:14,607
I'm going to turn on
my night light just in case.

68
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:18,326
That sounds like
a brilliant solution.

69
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,728
Mmm.

70
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:25,117
Hey, Jack?

71
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,068
Hey, mom?

72
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,637
Morning.

73
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,472
Morning, baby.

74
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,693
Hey, hon, the pick up
still won't start.

75
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,578
You mind dropping me off
on the way in?

76
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:38,911
Sure.

77
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,132
Did you feed Burrow?

78
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,567
Yeah, I fed him.

79
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:46,802
All right.
Good.

80
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:49,038
The night light
worked, didn't it?

81
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,826
I got it, dad.

82
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,635
What do you got
going today, Jack?

83
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:04,802
Uh, nothing much.

84
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,070
A math test
in a few days,

85
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:08,272
and I think
we're playing baseball

86
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,472
in gym class today,

87
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,091
so I can look forward
to sucking hard

88
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,725
in right field.

89
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,578
Well, just remember,

90
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,246
don't let the hitter get
the ball over your head...

91
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:19,816
Unless it's
out of the park.

92
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:22,985
Well, yeah.

93
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:48,558
Bye.

94
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:52,878
I get off early today.
All I have

95
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,531
is the Watsons-Willard
day bride's tractor sale.

96
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:58,517
You want me
to pick you up?

97
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,153
Yeah.

98
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,388
Then we can go to the drive-in
and make out tonight.

99
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:04,856
There hasn't been
a drive-in here

100
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:07,075
since the early
seventies, but...

101
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:10,996
I love you.

102
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:12,563
I love you.

103
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,630
Have a good one.

104
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:15,082
You, too.

105
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,742
Morning.

106
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:27,994
Derek.

107
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,129
Hey, Tom.

108
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:31,498
Morning, Joseph.

109
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,341
That's wild.

110
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,711
Hey, Tom.

111
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:47,878
Morning, Pat.

112
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,379
Hey, Mick.

113
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:50,548
Tom.

114
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:52,116
Charles is going to be
a little late this morning.

115
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:53,500
Is he drunk again?

116
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:54,901
Yeah, I guess.

117
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,971
Hey, who's the craziest
woman you ever dated?

118
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,305
Me?

119
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:00,707
Yeah. Mick and me,
we were talking

120
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:01,775
about some of the girls
we went with.

121
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:02,776
Uh-huh.

122
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,243
He once dated a girl

123
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,695
who used to attack him
in the middle of the night.

124
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:07,913
She what?

125
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,281
Yeah.

126
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,750
She used to have these
crazy goddamn dreams

127
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:12,968
where instead
of her boyfriend,

128
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,470
I was some kind
of demented killer.

129
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:15,970
I woke up one night,

130
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,390
she stuck a goddamn fork
in my shoulder.

131
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:19,774
You're kidding me.

132
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:22,811
No.
I'm spurting blood.

133
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:24,295
She's sitting there crying,

134
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:27,197
going, "baby,
I love you, I love you."

135
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,433
So, what happened?

136
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,684
You broke up
with her, right?

137
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,802
No, I married her.

138
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,623
Hey, it lasted 6 years.

139
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,492
Nobody's perfect,
Tom.

140
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,845
I guess not.

141
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:50,201
Strike this guy out.
We got 'em. Let's go.

142
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,621
Yeah.

143
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:55,072
2 out.

144
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,563
One winning run
coming right up, boys.

145
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,198
Go, Bobby!
Whoo!

146
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,500
It's all right, Billy.

147
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,802
Look alive, look alive.

148
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,258
Yeah!

149
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:19,377
Ball.

150
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,912
Yeah, that's it.

151
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,431
He's got
nothing. He's got nothing.

152
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,367
Let's go, let's go.
One more. Come on, now.

153
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:29,337
Come on, Bobby.

154
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,339
Yeah.
He's yours, he's yours.

155
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,526
Oh!
Whoo!

156
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,477
Whoo!

157
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,362
Easy, Jack.
Come on, Jack.

158
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,013
Don't drop it, Jack!

159
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:40,863
That's yours. Come on.

160
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:41,982
Jinx, Jackie boy!

161
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,216
Oh!

162
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:44,334
Game over!

163
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,569
Yellows win.
Let's go, guys.

164
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:47,787
Taylor, Dietrich,
you're on equipment.

165
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:48,889
Let's go.

166
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,310
Guys, come on.
Let's go.

167
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:56,311
Good try, Bobby.

168
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,379
You was robbed, Bobby.

169
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:00,282
Everyone
hit the showers.

170
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,266
Awesome.
Nice.

171
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:06,137
Good job.

172
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:21,184
Guess you think you're
hot shit, huh, Stall?

173
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:24,921
What?
No, I don't.

174
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,123
Little hero here, huh?

175
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,890
Little superstar here.

176
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,977
Little hero saves the day
at the last minute, right?

177
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,645
Bobby, it's just
a game, OK?

178
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,199
It's just
stupid gym class.

179
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,584
Who you calling
stupid?

180
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:43,720
Ahem. No, I said
gym class was stupid.

181
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,189
"No, I said
gym class was--"

182
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,090
listen to
this little faggot.

183
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:50,694
Yeah.
You're right.

184
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:54,363
I'm both little
and a faggot.

185
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:56,732
You got me
dead to rights.

186
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,402
Come on, chickenshit,
let's do this.

187
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:02,054
What would be the point?

188
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,940
I mean, you win.
You win, you win.

189
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:08,844
You've established
your Alpha male standing.

190
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:12,497
You've established
my unworthiness.

191
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:15,599
But doing violence to me
just seems--ahem--

192
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:18,669
pointless and cruel,
don't you think?

193
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,388
Let's do this,
you punk bitch.

194
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,573
Shouldn't that be
little punk ass

195
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:24,775
chickenshit
faggot bitch?

196
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:29,629
Chickenshit
faggot bitch.

197
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:33,249
Uh-oh.

198
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:36,468
God!

199
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:44,392
Bobby is
a chickenshit.

200
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,297
Hey, good looking.

201
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,657
Where are we going?

202
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,593
Well, Jack's studying
over at Judy Danvers',

203
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,630
and Martha's
taking care of Sarah.

204
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,265
Yeah?

205
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,766
Yeah.

206
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:32,469
So, where are we going?

207
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,608
We never got to be
teenagers together.

208
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,011
Uh-huh.

209
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,047
I'm going
to fix that.

210
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:28,720
What's going on
in there?

211
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:31,823
Keep your shirt on.
I'm coming.

212
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:49,455
Holy cow.

213
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:51,825
What?

214
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,250
Do you need some help
with that, big boy?

215
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:03,918
Uh...

216
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:05,654
Maybe.

217
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:12,360
Oh, my God.

218
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,138
What have you done
with my wife?

219
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:25,437
Ready?

220
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:26,706
OK!

221
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:29,358
Go, Wildcats!

222
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:34,530
No wives in here, mister.

223
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,467
Mmm.

224
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,186
Wow.

225
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:43,655
Shh.

226
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:46,540
Quiet. My parents
are in the next room.

227
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,876
Mmm.

228
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,152
You're naughty.

229
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,079
What are you doing?

230
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,766
Nothing.

231
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:39,404
You are such a bad boy.

232
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,406
Mm-hmm.

233
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,710
Rah, rah,
sis, boom, bah.

234
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:52,616
Oh.

235
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:56,453
There wasn't much
of that in high school.

236
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,423
Ah...

237
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,445
Mmm.

238
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,623
Uhh.
Mmm.

239
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:25,630
What is it?

240
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:29,700
Huh?

241
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:33,970
I remember the moment I knew
you were in love with me.

242
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:39,143
I saw it in your eyes.

243
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,813
I can still see it.

244
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,818
Of course you can.

245
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:01,163
I still love you.

246
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,791
I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch alive.

247
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:22,515
You are the best man
I've ever known.

248
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:26,017
There's no luck
involved.

249
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,564
You want to go down and
get some food or something?

250
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:42,666
You ever wonder
what kids did for fun

251
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:45,702
on a Saturday night
100 years ago?

252
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,137
I don't know.

253
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,539
I guess
I always figured

254
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,108
they got into
their parents' wagon

255
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:52,976
and went cruising up
and down their main drag

256
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:56,178
playing loud banjo music
and acting like idiots.

257
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,150
So, you think this is
as good as it gets?

258
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:03,318
For us?

259
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:05,087
Yeah.

260
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:07,188
For now.

261
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:10,191
Eventually,
we--we grow up,

262
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,926
we get jobs,
we have affairs,

263
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,062
and we become
alcoholics.

264
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:19,933
Ahem.

265
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,535
You know, sometimes,

266
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:24,571
you depress me.

267
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,776
Hey, that's what
I'm good at.

268
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,203
Give me that.

269
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,491
Hey, isn't that
that Stall faggot?

270
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,326
Yeah.

271
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:51,995
You should go
kick his ass.

272
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:54,648
I'm going to.

273
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:13,882
Who the fuck was that?

274
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,119
I don't know, and
I don't want to know.

275
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:24,024
Can I just say how sick I am
of these Podunk towns

276
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:26,577
and the goddamn Podunks
who live in 'em?

277
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:29,247
Do you think
if you keep saying that

278
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:30,364
it's actually going
to change anything?

279
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:32,699
I am so sick
of this shit.

280
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:34,701
Yeah,
you made that clear

281
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,537
about 10,000 Miles ago.

282
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:38,321
Now, if you haven't got
a better idea,

283
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:41,791
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

284
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,609
We are so
goddamned broke.

285
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:48,013
Yeah, well...

286
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:50,082
That's easy to fix.

287
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,067
No way.

288
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:54,502
Come on.
Mm-mmm.

289
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,304
Are you going to go
shoot pool with Jerry?

290
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:58,706
Maybe.

291
00:21:58,774 --> 00:21:59,474
Thanks, Tom.

292
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,959
Thanks, Mick--
good as ever.

293
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:03,710
There you go.

294
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:05,328
See you in church.

295
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:06,914
Yep. Have
a good evening.

296
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:09,432
You, too. See you
tonight, Charlotte.

297
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:11,151
Yeah.
See you.

298
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:13,035
Oh, I'm sorry.

299
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:17,039
Aw, it's all right,
old fella.

300
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:19,775
Just closing up,
fellas.

301
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,914
Coffee...

302
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:27,582
Black.

303
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,750
The same.

304
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:30,585
I'll have some pie--

305
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,387
some of that
lemon meringue pie.

306
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:36,706
Guys, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm--we're closed.

307
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,659
I said...

308
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:39,893
Coffee!

309
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:46,349
OK.

310
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:49,886
I guess
we can handle that.

311
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:56,408
It's not very fresh.

312
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,783
You can go home now,
Charlotte.

313
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,702
Just leave the pie.

314
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,720
OK.

315
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,010
Billy...

316
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,819
You're going to be sticking
around for a while, honey.

317
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:30,556
Tom?

318
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:37,029
Don't fuckin' move.

319
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:48,805
Sir, we don't--we don't
carry much cash here.

320
00:23:48,957 --> 00:23:50,340
You gentlemen
are certainly welcome

321
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:51,658
to all of it.

322
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,044
Oh, I know that,
asshole, believe me.

323
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,346
I do know that.

324
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:58,431
Aah!
Shut up, bitch!

325
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,787
OK, Billy...

326
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:07,990
Let's show this asshole
we mean business.

327
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:10,157
What? Her?

328
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,859
Yes, her.

329
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:14,578
Do her!

330
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:17,298
Aah!

331
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,475
Uhh.

332
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,076
Aah!
Uhh.

333
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,165
Unh.

334
00:25:06,494 --> 00:25:08,077
I'm telling you,
those men were--

335
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:09,645
they were going
to kill us.

336
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:11,614
They were going
to kill us,

337
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,499
and if it weren't
for Tom...

338
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:14,733
He's a hero.

339
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,002
...in conjunction
with several murders

340
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:17,986
in those states.

341
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:19,487
Now, Tom Stall
is a family man

342
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:21,924
with longstanding ties
to this community.

343
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:25,226
Tom Stall was just
another hard-working

344
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:26,894
small business
owner and operator

345
00:25:26,962 --> 00:25:29,430
in Millbrook, Indiana,
but now--

346
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:33,318
um, one of the guys
had a...

347
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:34,701
A gun to my head,

348
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:36,936
and Tom--
he was amazing. He--

349
00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:45,077
Hi, baby.

350
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,061
Hey, honey.

351
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,179
How you doing?

352
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:50,249
How are you?

353
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,134
Uhh.

354
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:55,937
Are you as sick of
hearing about me as I am?

355
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:59,374
No, I kind of like it.

356
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:00,708
Look.

357
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:02,060
Your picture's
in the paper.

358
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,526
Oh, God.

359
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:22,728
Careful.

360
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,116
Hi, guys.

361
00:26:28,184 --> 00:26:29,617
Mom.

362
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:33,188
Can I--can I
get up now?

363
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:34,189
You got it, dad?

364
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:35,190
Yeah.

365
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,225
Way to go, Tommy.

366
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:37,691
We're all
here for you, Tom.

367
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:40,911
Way to go, Tom.

368
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:41,729
Hi, sweetie.

369
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:44,015
Oh, that's so nice.

370
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:47,918
Thank you so much
for coming.

371
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,770
We're in Millbrook,
just outside the home

372
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:53,906
of American hero
Tom Stall,

373
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:55,591
who's just now returning
from the hospital

374
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,443
with his family.

375
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:03,448
Mr. Stall,
Jenny Wyatt, WRPK news.

376
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:05,116
I have a few
questions for you.

377
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:06,284
How did it feel

378
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:08,153
when you saw the guns
of those ruthless killers

379
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:09,736
pointed
directly at you?

380
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:10,972
How did it feel?

381
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,640
Yeah.

382
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,776
Not very good.

383
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,779
Not very good.

384
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,014
Were you surprised,
though,

385
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:23,249
by your own reaction
to the situation?

386
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:25,318
Uh...

387
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:27,487
What I did was...

388
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:30,155
I mean, anybody
would have done that.

389
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:33,692
It was just...
It was a terrible thing.

390
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,228
I think we'll all
be better off

391
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:37,179
when we get past it.

392
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:38,830
Yeah, but you really went
beyond what the average--

393
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:40,398
I--I need to--

394
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:42,000
I really need to be
with my family.

395
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,801
Thanks.

396
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:46,770
I'm Jenny Wyatt
in Millbrook,

397
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:48,473
and that was Tom Stall--

398
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,109
American hero,
man of few words.

399
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:56,346
Well, I guess that's all
we're going to get.

400
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:02,785
Man, it's good
to be home.

401
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,254
I hope there won't be
too much more of that.

402
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,426
Hey, dad, they all just
want to interview you

403
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:13,427
because of what you did.

404
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,814
You're a hero, dad.
Ha ha!

405
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,783
No, I'm not.

406
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:21,152
I just got lucky--
very lucky.

407
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,253
This will all blow over

408
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,920
as soon as they find
some other hot story.

409
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:26,123
Yeah.
Maybe the Lydons

410
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,191
will have
another 2-headed cow.

411
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,560
You guys aren't
thinking big enough.

412
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:31,928
<i>You could probably do
Larry king live, dad.</i>

413
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:33,563
That would be cool.

414
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:35,064
Stop it.

415
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,168
Look at this--
more reporters.

416
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:40,953
Are they
still there?

417
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:43,105
Yeah. Now there's some car
parked across the road.

418
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:43,822
They're just
sitting there.

419
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:44,906
Huh.

420
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:45,907
Does anyone want some tea?

421
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:47,009
I'll take some, mom.

422
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:48,444
Yes, please.

423
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:51,880
Unh.
Aw, jeez.

424
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:11,931
Hey, Edie.

425
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,133
Hi.
How are you?

426
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:14,233
Did you go
to the shop?

427
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,401
Yes, sir.

428
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:17,503
Hello.
Hey, bill.

429
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:18,504
Hi, honey.

430
00:29:18,572 --> 00:29:20,439
Hi, baby.
How are you?

431
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:21,974
Oh, I'm all right.

432
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,108
What brings you by?

433
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:24,510
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

434
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:26,344
Doing good.
Business is great.

435
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:27,345
Just can't keep up.

436
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,347
Yeah, it's busy.

437
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:33,317
Oh, look,
more reporters. Nice.

438
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:37,036
They don't look
like reporters.

439
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:39,556
Grilled cheese
is ready.

440
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:44,294
Got fries and
a strawberry shake.

441
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:48,030
Hello.
Welcome to Stall's.

442
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:50,066
Would you gentlemen
like some coffee?

443
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:52,518
You're the hero.

444
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:56,122
Uh, I don't know, sir.
I was just--

445
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,456
nah, you're
the big hero.

446
00:29:57,523 --> 00:30:00,758
You sure took care
of those 2 bad men.

447
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:04,062
I really don't like
talking about it, sir.

448
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:06,414
We're trying to get
back to normal here.

449
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:08,682
So, can I offer
you gentlemen some coffee?

450
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,368
Sure. Give me some coffee.
Make it black...

451
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:12,485
Yes, sir.

452
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,187
Joey.

453
00:30:15,974 --> 00:30:18,841
And--and
your friends?

454
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:20,309
They don't drink coffee.

455
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:22,912
It doesn't agree
with them...

456
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,647
Joey.

457
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:27,150
Who's Joey?

458
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:28,883
You are.

459
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,705
My name's Tom, sir.

460
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,574
Of course it is.

461
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,898
Mmm. That's
good coffee.

462
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:48,118
Thank you, sir.

463
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:51,421
If I were to find coffee
as good in Philadelphia,

464
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:54,391
but you know that,
don't you, Tom?

465
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:57,394
Heh.

466
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:59,195
No, actually,
I don't.

467
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:01,563
I've never been
to Philadelphia.

468
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:04,400
Pennsylvania? Is that where
you gentlemen are from?

469
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:07,570
Yeah, like
you don't know.

470
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:11,573
Sorry. Did--did we
know each other?

471
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,099
You tell me.

472
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,470
No.

473
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:28,071
We don't know
each other.

474
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:29,890
Come on, Joey.
Cut the crap.

475
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,241
My name is Tom.

476
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:32,641
Joey Cusack.

477
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:35,978
Your name is
Joey Cusack.

478
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:37,480
You're from Philly.

479
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,434
Mm-hmm. OK.

480
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:43,268
Whatever.
Uh-huh.

481
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,604
Excuse me, gentlemen,

482
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,106
if you're not going
to order anything,

483
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,173
my husband and I
would appreciate it

484
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,358
if you would be
on your way.

485
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:52,993
We ate
on the road.

486
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:55,062
It's all right.

487
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:56,680
It's OK.

488
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,034
We really are
very busy here today,

489
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,235
as you can see.

490
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,254
Um, so if you gentlemen
aren't going to be eating,

491
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:09,408
I really should offer your
seats to paying customers.

492
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:10,726
Hmm.

493
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,228
Well...

494
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:20,401
Now we're
paying customers.

495
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:23,722
I can't take this.

496
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,406
It shouldn't be
any problem for you.

497
00:32:25,507 --> 00:32:27,107
What is that
supposed to mean?

498
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:30,261
Mr. Fogarty's just making
conversation here.

499
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:31,462
Well, whatever you
want to call it,

500
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,330
this conversation
is over.

501
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:35,665
I think he wants us
to leave, Mr. Fogarty.

502
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:36,899
Do you know
what he does

503
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,635
when he don't like people,
Mr. Fogarty?

504
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,219
Yeah.
I'm scared.

505
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:43,022
We should leave before he goes
all dirty Harry on us.

506
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:48,293
I want to thank you
for the coffee, Joey.

507
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:51,063
It really is very good.

508
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:54,483
It's Tom.
My name's Tom Stall.

509
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:11,864
Excuse me.

510
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:18,186
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

511
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,523
Hi--hi, Molly.
This is Edie Stall.

512
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,024
Is he in?

513
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:23,426
I'm fine, thanks.

514
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:25,177
You're calling Sam?

515
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:26,762
Yes.

516
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,979
Is there a problem
with my driving, officer?

517
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:06,481
Can I see
your license, sir?

518
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,150
Sure.

519
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:15,556
I thought I was
under the limit.

520
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:20,327
Is there some problem
I should know about?

521
00:34:21,278 --> 00:34:23,412
What's your business
in Millbrook, sir?

522
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:25,081
We're tourists.

523
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,351
And what business did you
have at Stall's diner today?

524
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:31,553
We heard the coffee
was terrific.

525
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:35,407
Let me make something clear
to you and...

526
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,275
To Mr. Mulligan.

527
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:38,577
Uh-huh?

528
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:41,146
This is a nice town.

529
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,614
We have
nice people here.

530
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,983
We take care
of our nice people.

531
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,685
Do you understand me?

532
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,136
Yeah, sure.

533
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:52,455
Don't let me see you
around again.

534
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,157
You keep up the good
work, officer.

535
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:11,123
Charles Roarke,
Philadelphia.

536
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:14,959
Indicted on 3 counts
of murder.

537
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:17,762
Frank Mulligan,
out of New York,

538
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,198
indicted on one count
of murder.

539
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:23,718
Questioned in relation to
dozens of acts of violence

540
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:26,386
that you don't want
to hear about.

541
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:29,923
Both men work
for Carl Fogarty.

542
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,825
He's the fella
with the eye.

543
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:33,727
He spent 15 years
in prison

544
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:35,294
on several counts
of assault.

545
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:37,897
He's suspected in
half a dozen murders

546
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:40,299
and more disappearances.

547
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,752
Tom, these guys
are organized crime

548
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:44,854
from the east coast.

549
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,654
Now, they're
the real thing.

550
00:35:46,722 --> 00:35:48,056
They're bad men.

551
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:49,941
Jesus.

552
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:51,676
Jesus, honey.

553
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,480
I have to ask you
a question.

554
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,952
Are you in some kind of
Witness Protection plan?

555
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:04,254
Sam.

556
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:05,489
Some kind of what?

557
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:07,089
This is no
laughing matter, Edie.

558
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:08,825
Of course he's not, Sam.

559
00:36:08,926 --> 00:36:12,211
I'd just like to
hear Tom say that.

560
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:23,188
OK. No. No, I'm not
in a witness program.

561
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:24,939
Those men just have
the wrong guy.

562
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:27,224
They must've seen me on TV,
and I guess, uh,

563
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:29,243
I reminded them
of this Johnny guy.

564
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,445
Joey.
J-Joey somebody.

565
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,915
I mean, good lord.
The idea of me--

566
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,733
I never honestly
believed it,

567
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:38,468
but I had to ask.

568
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,070
I've done
some research

569
00:36:41,138 --> 00:36:43,723
on this, uh,
Joey Cusack.

570
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,025
I didn't find
anything.

571
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:47,677
But there is
a Richie Cusack

572
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:49,511
in Philadelphia.

573
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:51,747
Apparently,
he's the head

574
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:54,215
of some kind of
crime syndicate

575
00:36:54,283 --> 00:36:55,784
in that city.

576
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:57,886
Men like this
come to our town

577
00:36:58,004 --> 00:36:59,287
and start harassing
a citizen,

578
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:00,755
we have to
take them seriously.

579
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:02,389
Sure.

580
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:05,259
All right.
So, if you folks

581
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:06,794
see them
coming around,

582
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,328
you let me know.

583
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:10,563
Will do.

584
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:12,099
I'm sorry, Sam.

585
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,800
Do you want a piece
of pie or something?

586
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,268
Ah, no, thanks, Edie.

587
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:18,071
I'd love to, but I've
gotta get back to work.

588
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,039
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.

589
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,640
Uh, Sam?

590
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:22,791
Thank you.

591
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,094
It's good to know you're
watching out for us.

592
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,563
Come on, Tom.

593
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:30,265
You know we look out
for our own here.

594
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,816
Good night.

595
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,334
Good night.

596
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:35,570
See ya. Thanks.

597
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:47,481
Huh.

598
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,936
Don't worry.

599
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,573
They're as good as gone.

600
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:04,530
Sorry.

601
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:06,231
Sorry.

602
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:12,337
It's over
and done with.

603
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,225
OK.

604
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,883
Honey. Can you
get that, hon?

605
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:24,151
Come on, come on!

606
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:28,956
Hello?

607
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,907
The shotgun, Edie!
Get the shotgun!

608
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:32,476
Tom, Tom--
Tom, what's wrong?

609
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,261
They're coming
to the house!

610
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:35,312
Who's coming to the house?

611
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:36,980
Just grab it!
Do it and be ready!

612
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,347
OK, stop. Are you serious?

613
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,549
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

614
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:46,372
Shit.

615
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,316
Come on.

616
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,741
Oh, shit.

617
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:10,443
Oh, come on.

618
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:19,484
Come on.

619
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:41,104
Edie!

620
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,739
Oh.

621
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,892
Ohh, fuck. Tom!

622
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:50,529
Tom. Tom,
what's going on?

623
00:40:50,597 --> 00:40:51,696
I--
huh?

624
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:53,966
I--I don't know,
baby.

625
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,117
Jesus.

626
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:58,236
What's going on?

627
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:00,322
I don't--I don't know.

628
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:01,522
Ohh.

629
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:04,308
Let me call Sam,
all right?

630
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,077
No, don't.
OK.

631
00:41:06,145 --> 00:41:08,312
I--I don't even know--

632
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,215
I--I don't know why
I thought--

633
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:12,682
I--

634
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,534
mom?

635
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:15,953
It's OK, baby.

636
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:25,194
Yeah. Uh...Ha ha.

637
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:27,196
I--

638
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:30,700
I--I--I think
I'm losing my mind.

639
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:32,135
No, no, no. OK.

640
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:33,401
You're not
losing your mind.

641
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:35,003
You've been through
some serious trauma.

642
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,404
All right?

643
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,406
I'm here for you, baby.
We're all here for you.

644
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:39,941
It's all right.
It's gonna be OK.

645
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:41,759
Mom?

646
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:44,795
You haven't forgotten about
my new shoes, have you?

647
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:45,863
Gosh, no.

648
00:41:45,931 --> 00:41:47,464
It's my top priority
for the day.

649
00:41:47,532 --> 00:41:48,866
How could I forget?
You all right?

650
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:50,167
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:51,902
Hi--hi, sweetie.

652
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,637
Honey, just get ready
for school.

653
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:55,471
I'll speak to you
afterwards, all right?

654
00:41:55,538 --> 00:41:56,873
OK.

655
00:41:58,275 --> 00:42:00,160
Come on.

656
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:02,328
Let's go shopping.

657
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,543
Hey.

658
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:22,362
Careful. It's loaded.

659
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:38,861
Why was mom running
around the house with that?

660
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:40,980
What's going on, dad?

661
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:43,515
False alarm.

662
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:45,467
Nothing to worry about.

663
00:42:46,802 --> 00:42:48,369
<i>I am worried.</i>

664
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:51,406
You're sweating.
You're soaked, dad.

665
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:53,173
What kind of
false alarm?

666
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,826
What did you mean,
you think you--

667
00:42:54,893 --> 00:42:56,477
you think you're
losing your mind?

668
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:00,697
Some mob guys
showed up at the diner.

669
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:04,001
They saw me on TV,

670
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:07,304
and they came by
to take a look at me.

671
00:43:07,338 --> 00:43:08,987
Yeah.

672
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:10,956
Yeah, I heard
about that. Uh...

673
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:12,091
So...

674
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:13,509
They thought
they knew me.

675
00:43:15,378 --> 00:43:17,446
They thought...

676
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,613
I was somebody else.

677
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:21,399
Heh. That's weird.

678
00:43:21,484 --> 00:43:24,735
Yeah. Weird.

679
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,489
And I guess, um...
Well, I guess

680
00:43:27,557 --> 00:43:30,824
they don't like this guy
they think you are.

681
00:43:30,892 --> 00:43:33,961
Apparently not.

682
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,181
And, um,
and I guess I--

683
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:39,416
I guess--
I guess they want

684
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,617
to kill this guy
they think you are?

685
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,954
See, that's--that's
the losing my mind part.

686
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,423
I mean, I have no reason
to think that.

687
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,508
It's just...

688
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:51,443
I was down at work,
and, you know,

689
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,245
suddenly I thought
maybe--

690
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:56,265
maybe...

691
00:43:56,332 --> 00:43:58,867
They'd come
looking around.

692
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:00,235
You know?

693
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,539
And, uh...

694
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:08,709
And then you came running
back here to save us?

695
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:12,412
Yeah,
something silly like that.

696
00:44:13,714 --> 00:44:15,982
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:18,718
What if you're right?

698
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:24,806
Then we deal with it.

699
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:00,005
OK.

700
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:17,487
Now,
look what I just found.

701
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:19,323
It's my last pair
in this style,

702
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:20,590
and it's exactly
your size.

703
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:22,893
Just try these on.
They should fit like a dream.

704
00:45:24,296 --> 00:45:25,728
How do they feel?

705
00:45:25,796 --> 00:45:28,564
Good. Yeah,
I think I like them.

706
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:29,949
I have a pair
of these myself.

707
00:45:30,017 --> 00:45:31,334
They look great
and they really last.

708
00:45:31,385 --> 00:45:34,153
Really? OK.
I'll take them.

709
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:36,688
And I needed a pair
for her as well.

710
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:40,058
Sarah?

711
00:45:43,663 --> 00:45:45,196
Sarah?

712
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:46,414
Uh, ma'am?
The shoes--

713
00:45:46,481 --> 00:45:47,665
I have to find
my daughter.

714
00:45:47,733 --> 00:45:49,299
I can't let you leave
the store with the shoes.

715
00:45:49,368 --> 00:45:51,168
OK, OK, OK. Sarah!

716
00:45:52,354 --> 00:45:54,455
Sarah?

717
00:45:57,391 --> 00:45:59,292
Sarah?

718
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:12,087
Sarah. Sarah...

719
00:46:12,155 --> 00:46:13,789
Don't ever
do that again, OK?

720
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,190
I'm sorry, mommy.

721
00:46:15,258 --> 00:46:17,226
But look. They have
the new Vespa dolls.

722
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:18,876
Nothin' to worry about,
Mrs. Stall.

723
00:46:18,928 --> 00:46:20,761
I've been watching
over her.

724
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:22,563
You stay the fuck
away from my family,

725
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:23,981
you son of a bitch.

726
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,850
There's no need
for that kind of language,

727
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:28,218
Mrs. Stall.

728
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,136
Listen to me.
I don't know what you want,

729
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,805
and I don't really care.

730
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,740
You should care about
what I want, Mrs. Stall,

731
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:36,359
because I want something
from your husband

732
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:38,044
that might affect you,

733
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:40,813
might change your life.

734
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,798
My husband
does not know you.

735
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:45,067
He wouldn't know you,
somebody like you.

736
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:48,120
Oh, he knows
Carl Fogarty, all right.

737
00:46:48,187 --> 00:46:49,920
He knows me intimately.

738
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:52,690
See?

739
00:46:52,758 --> 00:46:56,061
This isn't
a completely dead eye.

740
00:46:56,128 --> 00:46:58,430
It still works a bit.

741
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:00,831
The problem is, the only
thing I can see with it

742
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:03,149
is Joey Cusack.

743
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:06,136
And it can see
right through him.

744
00:47:06,187 --> 00:47:08,472
Right through
your husband, Edie.

745
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:12,475
See what's inside him,
what makes him tick.

746
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,810
He's still the same guy.

747
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:15,795
No.

748
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:18,781
He's still
crazy fuckin' Joey.

749
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,716
And you know it,
don't you?

750
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:23,017
I know that my husband
is Tom Stall.

751
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:24,285
That's what I know.

752
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:25,186
Yeah?
Yeah.

753
00:47:25,254 --> 00:47:26,655
Well, why don't
you ask Tom

754
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:28,356
about his older
brother Richie?

755
00:47:28,423 --> 00:47:29,207
He doesn't--

756
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:31,775
ask Tom about how he tried
to rip my eye out

757
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:33,927
with barbed wire.

758
00:47:33,995 --> 00:47:36,062
And ask him, Edie,

759
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:42,118
how come he's so good
at killing people?

760
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:45,839
If I see you
within 500 feet of me

761
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:48,307
or my children or my husband,
I'll have you arrested.

762
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:49,575
Heh heh heh heh.

763
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:52,478
Can I possibly make myself
any clearer than that?

764
00:47:52,546 --> 00:47:53,945
No, no, Mrs. Stall,
you can't.

765
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:56,181
I thank you
for your time.

766
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,884
You have
an enchanting daughter.

767
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,821
And, Mrs. Stall...

768
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:05,156
Don't forget
your shoes.

769
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:07,442
Heh heh heh heh.

770
00:48:07,576 --> 00:48:08,959
So,
how's your dad?

771
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:11,496
I don't know.
A little weird.

772
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:13,297
Well, after what
he went through?

773
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:16,133
I mean, actually
killing someone?

774
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,236
I mean, that's enough
to freak anybody out.

775
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:21,905
Yeah. I guess.

776
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:28,026
So, your old man's some
kind of tough guy, huh?

777
00:48:28,094 --> 00:48:30,195
What's he think
of his wimp son?

778
00:48:30,263 --> 00:48:32,297
You think
he'd take this shit?

779
00:48:32,432 --> 00:48:33,348
You think
he'd make jokes?

780
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,799
Go on, bitch.
Say something funny.

781
00:48:35,935 --> 00:48:37,451
Bobby, leave him alone.

782
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,020
Shut up, skank.

783
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:42,607
Uh-oh.
He's gettin' mad.

784
00:48:42,675 --> 00:48:45,625
Jack, let's just
get out of here, OK?

785
00:48:46,744 --> 00:48:49,346
Jack, he's an asshole.
You know that.

786
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:51,732
He doesn't mean shit.
Let's just go.

787
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:53,633
Let's just
get out of here, OK?

788
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:56,702
Yeah, puss.
Run away.

789
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,270
Goddamn,
I bet your daddy

790
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:00,138
would be real
ashamed by you.

791
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,492
Go ahead, bitch.
Say something funny.

792
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:06,377
Make me laugh.

793
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:22,059
Uhh!

794
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:23,677
Ohh!

795
00:49:23,745 --> 00:49:25,546
Uhh!

796
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:27,530
OK,
you motherfucker!

797
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:31,183
Get over there,
you son of a bitch!

798
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:32,318
Ohh!

799
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,652
Come here.
Are you laughin'?

800
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,455
Are you laughin' now,

801
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:40,225
you motherfucking
cocksucking piece of shit?!

802
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,483
What the hell
were you thinking?

803
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,116
I wasn't thinking.

804
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:50,734
Obviously not.

805
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:53,070
Bobby's been riding me
all year, dad.

806
00:49:53,137 --> 00:49:54,438
He's a jerk.

807
00:49:55,606 --> 00:49:56,707
He's a jerk?

808
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:58,676
Yeah. He's a jerk.

809
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:01,361
That's no excuse.
You stand up to him.

810
00:50:01,429 --> 00:50:03,112
You don't put him
in the hospital!

811
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,915
Oh, big deal.
It's the best thing

812
00:50:06,017 --> 00:50:07,167
anyone could've
done to him.

813
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:09,051
Besides,
I only got suspended.

814
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,753
<i>It is a big deal!</i>

815
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,621
His parents say
they might sue us.

816
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:14,790
There could be
assault charges.

817
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:15,741
We can't
afford that, Jack.

818
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:17,175
We don't have
that kind of money.

819
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,411
Oh, what? Mom's not
gonna take the case?

820
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:20,611
Oh, whatever, dad--

821
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:23,547
listen, smart mouth!

822
00:50:23,616 --> 00:50:25,349
In this family, we do
not solve our problems

823
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:26,717
by hitting people!

824
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:28,953
No, in this family,
we shoot them!

825
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:30,204
Ah!

826
00:50:36,427 --> 00:50:37,877
Jack.

827
00:50:48,472 --> 00:50:51,474
Honey,
have you seen Jack?

828
00:50:55,044 --> 00:50:56,578
What?

829
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,698
What's wrong, baby?

830
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:06,486
Fogarty and his men
followed us to the mall.

831
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,255
He what?

832
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,726
Call Sam. Should--
should we call Sam?

833
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:13,843
We should call--

834
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:15,244
I already
took care of it, honey.

835
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:18,063
I already took care of it.
Went down to the courthouse,

836
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:20,182
got a restraining order.

837
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,318
A lot of good
that'll do.

838
00:51:22,419 --> 00:51:25,204
Well, it's something.

839
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:27,072
At least
we could have him arrested

840
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:28,940
if he ever
comes around here again.

841
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,461
You're right.

842
00:51:36,464 --> 00:51:38,231
But I have
to tell you something.

843
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:41,234
What?

844
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,905
This man Fogarty
really believes

845
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:49,041
that you're
this Joey Cusack.

846
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:51,627
I mean...

847
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,496
The things that he told me
this afternoon--

848
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:54,630
what things?

849
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:56,048
Things. Just bullshit.

850
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,450
But he's, uh...

851
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:01,536
He's sure that it's you.

852
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:04,272
And we have to convince him
that it's not.

853
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,024
Well, I don't think
he's interested

854
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:09,593
in examining my DNA.

855
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,947
Get off our property.

856
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,482
We'll go, Joey.

857
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,367
We just want you
to come with us.

858
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,719
Come back to Philly,
see some people.

859
00:52:38,787 --> 00:52:39,770
I told you,

860
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:41,990
I have never been
to Philadelphia.

861
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:44,976
Heh. You almost believe
your own crap, don't you?

862
00:52:45,043 --> 00:52:48,562
You know, you're trying
so hard to be this other guy.

863
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:50,697
It's painful to watch.

864
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,901
Charlie.
Hey.

865
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:57,203
Look what we found.

866
00:52:57,271 --> 00:52:59,304
Come on.

867
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:00,706
Yeah?
Ha ha ha.

868
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:02,107
Mom!
Jack!

869
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:04,710
No! Edie! Edie!
Mom!

870
00:53:04,778 --> 00:53:06,579
Edie! No! No!
Jack!

871
00:53:06,647 --> 00:53:08,381
Let go,
you son of a bitch!

872
00:53:08,448 --> 00:53:09,714
Come here.

873
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:13,418
Wait.

874
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:15,403
Mom.

875
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:18,924
Don't make us
hurt the kid, Joey.

876
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:21,241
We just want you to come
for a little trip with us

877
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:22,876
down memory Lane.

878
00:53:22,978 --> 00:53:26,647
Put the popgun down.
Come over and talk to us.

879
00:53:26,714 --> 00:53:27,931
Baby, wait.

880
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:31,401
Edie...
I will get him.

881
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:34,203
I'll get him.
Please.

882
00:53:34,271 --> 00:53:36,105
Go up to Sarah.

883
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:39,175
Go up to her.
Do it.

884
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,601
Put the gun down.

885
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:57,124
Put it down, Joey.

886
00:54:02,013 --> 00:54:04,781
Come closer.

887
00:54:10,254 --> 00:54:12,254
A little further.

888
00:54:18,878 --> 00:54:20,279
Come on.

889
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:37,193
Go back to the house, Jack.

890
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:42,633
Go on.

891
00:54:52,743 --> 00:54:54,575
You see how cozy
it can be

892
00:54:54,644 --> 00:54:57,045
when you decide
to play nice?

893
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:00,548
Now, come on, Joey.
Get in the car.

894
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:02,050
You won't need
your toothbrush.

895
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:04,019
We'll take care
of everything.

896
00:55:04,086 --> 00:55:07,287
I think it'd be better
if you'd just leave now.

897
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:14,411
Joey.

898
00:55:25,306 --> 00:55:27,055
Come on, Joey,
let's go.

899
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,944
Ahh!

900
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:34,797
Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!

901
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,631
Ohh! Ohh!

902
00:55:40,102 --> 00:55:42,169
Uhh!

903
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:43,938
Tom!

904
00:55:49,176 --> 00:55:50,676
Fuck.

905
00:55:53,214 --> 00:55:54,964
Mommy, what's wrong?

906
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:05,891
It's OK.

907
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,380
You got anything to say
before I blow your brains out,

908
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:14,181
you miserable prick?

909
00:56:16,301 --> 00:56:19,302
I should've killed you
back in Philly.

910
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,361
Yeah, Joey.

911
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:29,695
You should have.

912
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,522
Uhh!

913
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,257
Uhh.

914
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:11,922
Edie.

915
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,929
Honey, are you OK?

916
00:58:22,983 --> 00:58:24,816
Tell me the truth.

917
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:29,470
The truth?

918
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:35,493
Please. You can
do that, can't you?

919
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,299
You can do that,
can't you? Please?

920
00:58:42,366 --> 00:58:44,668
What do you think
you heard?

921
00:58:44,736 --> 00:58:47,520
It's not what I heard.

922
00:58:47,587 --> 00:58:49,421
It's what I saw.

923
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:55,795
I saw Joey.

924
00:58:55,863 --> 00:59:00,098
I saw you turn into Joey
right before my eyes.

925
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:05,003
I saw a killer--the one
Fogarty warned me about.

926
00:59:06,506 --> 00:59:08,805
You did kill men
back in Philly,

927
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:10,874
didn't you?

928
00:59:12,627 --> 00:59:14,294
Did you do it for money,

929
00:59:14,362 --> 00:59:16,096
or did you do it
because you enjoyed it?

930
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:18,214
Joey did, both.

931
00:59:18,282 --> 00:59:20,050
I didn't--

932
00:59:20,117 --> 00:59:21,817
Tom Stall didn't.

933
00:59:28,758 --> 00:59:31,059
Oh, God.

934
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,628
Oh, my God.

935
00:59:43,856 --> 00:59:45,823
Oh, God, it's
really happening.

936
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:47,525
Oh.

937
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,060
What are you,

938
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,429
like, some multiple
personality schizoid?

939
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,630
It's like flipping
a switch

940
00:59:54,698 --> 00:59:56,065
back and forth for you?

941
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:58,768
I never expected
to see Joey again.

942
00:59:58,836 --> 01:00:01,486
Oh, yeah. Joey.

943
01:00:01,554 --> 01:00:03,521
What, was he in hiding?
Was he dead?

944
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:05,490
I thought he was.

945
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:07,192
I thought I killed
Joey Cusack.

946
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,111
I went out to the desert,
and I killed him.

947
01:00:09,178 --> 01:00:10,329
Oh, my God.

948
01:00:10,397 --> 01:00:14,999
I spent 3 years
becoming Tom Stall.

949
01:00:15,017 --> 01:00:16,935
Edie, you have
to know this.

950
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:20,688
I wasn't really born again
until I met you.

951
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:23,890
I was nothing.

952
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:28,378
I don't believe you.

953
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:31,632
I can't believe
this is happening.

954
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:33,132
I can't believe
this is happening.

955
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,236
I can't believe this is
fucking happening!

956
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,624
You didn't grow up
in Portland.

957
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:44,826
And you never talk about
your adopted parents

958
01:00:44,894 --> 01:00:47,295
because
you don't have any!

959
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:50,398
And our name.

960
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:54,168
Jesus Christ,
my name.

961
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:56,771
Jack's name.
Sarah's name?

962
01:00:56,838 --> 01:01:01,358
Stall? Tom Stall?

963
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:05,695
Did you just
make that up?

964
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:08,297
Where did that name
come from?

965
01:01:09,516 --> 01:01:11,184
I mean...

966
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:15,587
It was available.

967
01:01:15,655 --> 01:01:17,005
Yeah.

968
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:29,800
I guess
I was available, too.

969
01:02:10,688 --> 01:02:12,589
Hey, Jack.

970
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,093
What am I supposed
to call you now?

971
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:23,532
You're supposed
to call me dad.

972
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,300
That's what I am--
your dad.

973
01:02:25,385 --> 01:02:26,702
Are you really?

974
01:02:26,804 --> 01:02:31,756
So, you're some kind of
closet mobster dad?

975
01:02:31,808 --> 01:02:33,842
I mean, if I go rob
Millikan's drug store,

976
01:02:33,909 --> 01:02:35,160
will you ground me

977
01:02:35,227 --> 01:02:37,229
if I don't give you
a piece of the action?

978
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,963
What, dad?
You tell me.

979
01:02:40,031 --> 01:02:42,199
Please, son.
Don't.

980
01:02:42,284 --> 01:02:44,384
If I talk to Sam
about you,

981
01:02:44,452 --> 01:02:46,620
will you
have me whacked?

982
01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:51,590
Jack.

983
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:54,130
Tom?

984
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:56,532
Hey, Sam.
How are you doing?

985
01:03:56,601 --> 01:03:58,301
Good to see you
up and around.

986
01:03:58,436 --> 01:03:59,452
Yeah.

987
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,487
You had her
runnin' yet?

988
01:04:01,556 --> 01:04:03,555
Yeah,
for a second there.

989
01:04:03,623 --> 01:04:05,892
She's coming back
to life.

990
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:09,061
Ah, shit.

991
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:12,631
Tom...

992
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,385
I got a problem.

993
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,739
Want to come inside
for a minute?

994
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:28,612
I've been running
through it all

995
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,781
for the last couple days.

996
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:35,551
It just doesn't fit.

997
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,921
What doesn't fit?

998
01:04:38,988 --> 01:04:40,272
None of it.

999
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:47,395
Is that Edie
coming home?

1000
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,264
Yeah.

1001
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:53,635
Well, we don't have
to do this now.

1002
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:56,904
Might as well.

1003
01:05:01,626 --> 01:05:03,727
Hi, Sam.

1004
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,412
Edie.

1005
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,413
How you doing?

1006
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:09,515
I'm OK.

1007
01:05:11,285 --> 01:05:12,718
You want some coffee?

1008
01:05:12,787 --> 01:05:14,587
No, I'm good.

1009
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:19,107
So, what brings you
out here?

1010
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:22,027
Well, Tom and I were just
talking about that.

1011
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:23,595
Mmm.

1012
01:05:23,662 --> 01:05:25,497
I'd like to hear it.

1013
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,517
Well, it's just that...

1014
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,020
None of this
makes any sense.

1015
01:05:33,105 --> 01:05:34,772
Mmm.

1016
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,340
These are serious
secretive men.

1017
01:05:36,408 --> 01:05:37,575
I mean, they wouldn't have
come out here,

1018
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,226
they wouldn't have
gone through all this,

1019
01:05:39,293 --> 01:05:41,727
exposed themselves
like this

1020
01:05:41,863 --> 01:05:44,481
unless they were dead certain
they had the right man.

1021
01:05:46,851 --> 01:05:49,285
So, what are you
saying, Sam?

1022
01:05:51,787 --> 01:05:56,091
I'm saying I think
I need to hear the truth.

1023
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,994
The truth?

1024
01:06:04,383 --> 01:06:07,351
The truth.

1025
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:17,977
Sam, you've got too much
time on your hands.

1026
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,263
I'm sorry?

1027
01:06:21,614 --> 01:06:23,749
Tom is...

1028
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:27,053
Tom is
who he says he is.

1029
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,772
That's all
that really matters.

1030
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:33,841
Sam, hasn't this family
suffered enough?

1031
01:06:37,563 --> 01:06:40,531
Well...

1032
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:42,099
Goddamn.

1033
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,104
Edie.

1034
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:48,739
It's OK.

1035
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:54,360
I guess I'll be going.

1036
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,085
You folks give me a ring
if you need anything.

1037
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,459
Anything at all,
understand?

1038
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:23,136
Thanks.

1039
01:07:24,805 --> 01:07:25,838
You...

1040
01:07:27,508 --> 01:07:29,075
Edie.

1041
01:07:29,142 --> 01:07:30,810
Edie!

1042
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:32,211
Get off of me!

1043
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:33,513
Unh!

1044
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,934
Fuck you, Joey!

1045
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:43,038
Aah! Get off!

1046
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:49,076
Uhh!

1047
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:24,292
Uhh!

1048
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:43,359
Ohh!

1049
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:53,368
Ohh. Ohh.

1050
01:09:06,632 --> 01:09:08,981
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

1051
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:12,552
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1052
01:09:15,055 --> 01:09:16,389
Mmm.

1053
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:39,877
Uhh.

1054
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:37,112
Uhh.

1055
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:43,018
Uhh.

1056
01:10:50,992 --> 01:10:52,359
Hello.

1057
01:10:52,427 --> 01:10:54,894
Hey, Bro-ham.

1058
01:10:54,962 --> 01:10:57,830
You're still pretty good
with the killing.

1059
01:10:57,898 --> 01:10:59,832
That's exciting.

1060
01:11:00,901 --> 01:11:02,201
Richie.

1061
01:11:02,269 --> 01:11:03,937
Yeah, it's Richie.

1062
01:11:04,004 --> 01:11:06,071
What do you say, Joey?

1063
01:11:06,139 --> 01:11:08,106
Are you going
to come see me?

1064
01:11:08,174 --> 01:11:10,508
Or do I have
to come see you?

1065
01:13:40,162 --> 01:13:42,463
What's that
supposed to mean?

1066
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:48,769
Uh, Jenny cream.

1067
01:13:48,836 --> 01:13:50,804
Bottle.

1068
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:33,643
You ruben?

1069
01:14:33,711 --> 01:14:35,794
Yeah.

1070
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:37,062
You Joey?

1071
01:14:48,256 --> 01:14:50,557
Yeah, I'm Joey.

1072
01:14:53,645 --> 01:14:55,412
So, what do we do now?

1073
01:14:58,098 --> 01:15:00,266
You finish your beer,

1074
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:03,135
then I take you to see
Richie in the escalade.

1075
01:15:24,272 --> 01:15:26,991
Nice houses.

1076
01:15:27,059 --> 01:15:30,226
Richie's a very upscale
kind of guy.

1077
01:15:46,527 --> 01:15:48,327
Nice gate.

1078
01:15:48,395 --> 01:15:50,728
Yeah.

1079
01:16:23,676 --> 01:16:24,943
We're here.

1080
01:16:25,962 --> 01:16:28,614
Home, sweet home.

1081
01:16:58,374 --> 01:17:00,542
Got to frisk you.

1082
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,377
Nah. I'll save you
the trouble.

1083
01:17:02,445 --> 01:17:03,811
I'm not packing.

1084
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:06,964
I got to frisk you.

1085
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:11,485
All right.

1086
01:17:11,553 --> 01:17:13,321
I don't smell very good.

1087
01:17:13,388 --> 01:17:15,422
I've been driving
pretty much non-stop

1088
01:17:15,489 --> 01:17:17,691
15 to 16 hours.

1089
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,993
I'll hold my nose.

1090
01:17:31,437 --> 01:17:32,504
Can you believe

1091
01:17:32,572 --> 01:17:34,240
that place
is still standing,

1092
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:36,524
the track and turf?

1093
01:17:43,215 --> 01:17:45,265
Didn't you bang
Jill Levy there

1094
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,934
right on the bar
in front of everybody?

1095
01:17:48,053 --> 01:17:50,771
I never banged
Jill Levy.

1096
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:57,110
Well, you should've.
She was--she was something.

1097
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:08,453
How you doing,
Richie?

1098
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:14,893
Mmm.

1099
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:29,372
Yeah.

1100
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,625
It's been a long,
long time, Bro-ham.

1101
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,286
Yeah.

1102
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:45,620
Yeah.

1103
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:47,940
Come with me.

1104
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:01,667
You want anything?

1105
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:03,436
Nah.

1106
01:19:08,408 --> 01:19:11,276
So, you like
that farm life?

1107
01:19:12,678 --> 01:19:15,180
Milking cows
and shit?

1108
01:19:15,248 --> 01:19:18,334
I don't have a farm.

1109
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:20,251
No?

1110
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,522
Fogarty thought you lived
on some kind of farm.

1111
01:19:25,975 --> 01:19:29,944
Said you could
smell pig.

1112
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:32,012
How that old fart
would know

1113
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,580
what a pig smells like,
I don't know,

1114
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:34,814
but that's what he said.

1115
01:19:39,387 --> 01:19:41,320
Ahem.

1116
01:19:41,388 --> 01:19:43,389
Do you like
being married?

1117
01:19:43,457 --> 01:19:45,291
What?

1118
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:47,593
Do you like
being married?

1119
01:19:49,145 --> 01:19:52,113
Does it work for you?

1120
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,766
I can't see it
working for me.

1121
01:19:54,834 --> 01:19:57,068
I never felt the urge,
you know?

1122
01:19:57,135 --> 01:20:00,204
A lot of great looking
women in the world.

1123
01:20:00,256 --> 01:20:01,589
I never met one

1124
01:20:01,657 --> 01:20:04,425
made me want to give up
all the others.

1125
01:20:04,492 --> 01:20:06,009
Sure, you can
fuck around,

1126
01:20:06,077 --> 01:20:08,445
but it's so much
goddamn work, you know?

1127
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:10,714
Keeping it quiet.

1128
01:20:10,782 --> 01:20:12,650
It's not worth
the effort.

1129
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,885
Don't see the upside.

1130
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:18,504
You see the upside,
Joey?

1131
01:20:19,657 --> 01:20:22,007
Yeah, Richie, I do.

1132
01:20:23,377 --> 01:20:25,410
I do now.

1133
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:31,016
I'm pretty pissed
at you, Bro-ham.

1134
01:20:32,418 --> 01:20:34,485
You could've called.

1135
01:20:34,552 --> 01:20:39,556
You could've dropped
a postcard in the mail.

1136
01:20:39,624 --> 01:20:42,660
We're brothers. What'd you
think would happen?

1137
01:20:56,306 --> 01:20:59,641
I thought that business
would come first.

1138
01:20:59,693 --> 01:21:01,376
Well, yeah.

1139
01:21:02,411 --> 01:21:04,847
Yeah, I know.

1140
01:21:04,914 --> 01:21:07,715
Tch. I know.

1141
01:21:10,118 --> 01:21:12,252
What am I going to do?

1142
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,156
You bust up
a made man's place.

1143
01:21:15,224 --> 01:21:17,340
You killed
some of his guys.

1144
01:21:17,408 --> 01:21:19,842
You take his eye.

1145
01:21:19,911 --> 01:21:23,546
Jesus, Joey,
you took his eye.

1146
01:21:23,614 --> 01:21:26,316
Barbed wire,
wasn't it?

1147
01:21:26,384 --> 01:21:28,667
That's disgusting.

1148
01:21:28,735 --> 01:21:30,218
You always were
the crazy one.

1149
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:31,387
Not anymore.

1150
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:33,005
Yeah, I heard.

1151
01:21:33,073 --> 01:21:34,640
You're living
the American dream.

1152
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:36,558
You really bought
into it, didn't you?

1153
01:21:36,626 --> 01:21:38,576
You've been
this other guy

1154
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:41,946
almost as long
as you've been yourself.

1155
01:21:44,883 --> 01:21:48,852
Hey, when you dream,

1156
01:21:48,919 --> 01:21:52,389
are you still Joey?

1157
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,809
Joey's been dead
a long time.

1158
01:21:55,861 --> 01:21:58,094
And yet here you sit...

1159
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,096
Big as life.

1160
01:22:04,017 --> 01:22:06,168
You know you cost me

1161
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:09,637
a lot of time and money.

1162
01:22:09,706 --> 01:22:12,157
Before you pulled
that shit with Fogarty,

1163
01:22:12,225 --> 01:22:14,876
I was a shoe-in
to take over

1164
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:18,713
when the boss croaked--
a shoe-in.

1165
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:21,331
It was made very clear
to me, Joey.

1166
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:23,934
I had to clean up
your mess,

1167
01:22:23,969 --> 01:22:27,255
or nothing was ever
going to happen for me.

1168
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:31,223
You got no idea
how much shit I had to pull

1169
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:34,444
to get back in
with those guys.

1170
01:22:36,313 --> 01:22:38,948
You cost me...

1171
01:22:41,117 --> 01:22:45,387
A hell of a lot, Joey,
a hell of a lot.

1172
01:22:46,939 --> 01:22:49,974
Looks like you're doing
all right over here.

1173
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:53,527
Yeah, I am, I am.

1174
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:57,931
I'm still behind
the eightball...

1175
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,817
Because of you.

1176
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:01,852
There's a certain
lack of respect,

1177
01:23:01,919 --> 01:23:04,654
a certain lack of trust.

1178
01:23:06,891 --> 01:23:08,442
The boys in Boston

1179
01:23:08,509 --> 01:23:10,977
are just waiting
for me to go down.

1180
01:23:16,049 --> 01:23:19,684
You always were
a problem for me, Joey.

1181
01:23:19,752 --> 01:23:22,054
When mom brought you home
from the hospital,

1182
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,855
I tried to strangle you
in your crib.

1183
01:23:24,923 --> 01:23:28,259
I guess all kids
try to do that.

1184
01:23:28,327 --> 01:23:30,261
She caught me,

1185
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:33,730
whacked the daylights
out of me.

1186
01:23:33,798 --> 01:23:36,533
I've heard that story.

1187
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:42,322
Well, what do you think?

1188
01:23:46,626 --> 01:23:48,861
Better late than never?

1189
01:23:48,963 --> 01:23:50,696
Richie...

1190
01:23:52,599 --> 01:23:55,467
I'm here to make peace.

1191
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:59,337
Tell me what I got to do
to make things right.

1192
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:03,758
You could do something,
I guess.

1193
01:24:08,763 --> 01:24:11,631
You could die, Joey.

1194
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:31,015
Ooh!

1195
01:24:33,303 --> 01:24:35,120
Uhh!

1196
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,271
Uhh!

1197
01:24:36,306 --> 01:24:38,005
Unh!
Oh!

1198
01:24:42,094 --> 01:24:43,094
Oh!

1199
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:45,346
Uhh!

1200
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:49,565
Uhh! Ohh!

1201
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:09,633
How do you fuck that up?

1202
01:25:10,669 --> 01:25:11,603
Uhh!

1203
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:15,689
How do you fuck that up?

1204
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:35,991
What are you going to do,
give him mouth-to-mouth?

1205
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:38,761
Did you see my brother?

1206
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:39,977
Fuckin' leave this

1207
01:25:40,045 --> 01:25:43,664
and let's just kill
that little fuck!

1208
01:26:45,355 --> 01:26:47,956
Jesus, Joey.

1209
01:27:10,912 --> 01:27:13,196
Jesus, Richie.
