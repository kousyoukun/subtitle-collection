1
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:16,538
我們繼續朝東走?
So, we keep headin' east?

2
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:20,305
是的 就這麼想的
Yeah, that's the idea.

3
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:22,141
遠離大城市?
Stay out of the big cities?

4
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:23,771
是啊
Uh-huh.

5
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:30,044
我覺得我都厭倦了
I think I'm tired.

6
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:33,488
是啊 我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

7
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:41,060
拿著
Here.

8
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:43,931
把車開到辦公室門口
Bring it on up to the office.

9
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,868
我去結帳
I'm going to go check us out.

10
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:47,336
好的
All right.

11
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:10,860
" 我匆匆趕路 "
" With the rushin' that way "

12
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,022
" 有一種感覺  那就是我的生活 "
" I had a feeling it was my day "

13
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,156
" 這麼多個日夜 "
" For one of those nights "

14
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:20,368
" 當你青春不在時  你會感到遺憾 "
" When you lose your cool, and you're feelin' sorry "

15
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:23,271
" 你所犯的錯就像故事書中所寫 "
" You're ridin' on sin to the page of a story "

16
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:28,006
" 又是蠢人的一天 "
" Of another great night in the life of a fool "

17
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,152
你幹什麼那麼久?
What took you so long?

18
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,749
沒什麼
Nothing.

19
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,997
我和服務員有點不愉快
I had a little trouble with the maid...

20
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:24,762
現在好了
but everything's fine now.

21
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,372
媽的
Damn.

22
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:36,039
才8:00
8:00.

23
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,173
就已經這麼熱了
It's already this hot.

24
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:43,014
我們還有水嗎?
How are we fixed for water?

25
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,112
可能快不夠了
Probably not enough.

26
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:47,282
確實是
Yeah.

27
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:59,298
在辦公室後面有一個製冷的飲水機
There's a cooler in the back in the office.

28
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:42,766
嘿
Hey.

29
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:10,224
啊  啊  啊
Aah! Aah! Aah!

30
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:12,792
莎拉 親愛的 怎麼了?
Sarah, honey, what's wrong?

31
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:17,671
怎麼了 寶貝?
What is it, sweetie? Hmm?

32
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,175
- 爸爸  - 恩?
- Daddy. - Yeah?

33
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:22,007
- 爸爸  - 爸爸在這裡
- Daddy. - Daddy's here.

34
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:25,913
- 爸爸在這裡  - 我夢到了妖怪
- Daddy's here. - There were monsters.

35
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:30,045
不  寶貝 世界上沒有妖怪
No, sweetie. There's no such thing as monsters.

36
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,782
你只是做了一個噩夢
You were just having a bad dream.

37
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:32,982
怎麼了 爸爸?
What's wrong, Dad?

38
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:38,589
嗨 老兄  莎拉做了個噩夢而已
Hi, kiddo. Sarah's just having a bad dream.

39
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,523
我看到妖怪  傑克
I saw monsters, Jack.

40
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:44,397
妖怪?
Monsters?

41
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,129
什麼樣子的?
What kind?

42
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,502
我不知道  它們從我的衣櫃裡鑽了出來
I don't know. They came out of my closet...

43
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,097
然後  他們一直在黑影裡
and then they were in the shadows.

44
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,041
噢  黑影妖怪
Mmm, shadow monsters.

45
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:54,202
好吧 它們看起來是有點可怕
Well, they look pretty scary...

46
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:55,871
但是他們什麼事情也不能做
but they really can't do anything...

47
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:57,540
尤其是當光照在它們身上的時候
especially when the lights are on.

48
00:06:57,581 --> 00:06:59,208
他們怕光
They're scared of the light.

49
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,217
怎麼了 寶貝?
What happened, baby?

50
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:04,513
- 你還好吧?  - 我很好
- You OK? - I'm OK.

51
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,455
莎拉剛才做夢 夢到了妖怪
Sarah had a bad dream about monsters.

52
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,617
- 噢  - 我正在給她說
- Oh. - And I was telling her...

53
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,490
實際上沒有妖怪這種東西
that there's no such thing as monsters.

54
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:14,591
我打開手電筒以防萬一
I'm going to turn on my night light just in case.

55
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:17,122
聽起來是個不錯的主意
That sounds like a brilliant solution.

56
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:27,242
- 嘿 傑克?  - 嘿 媽媽?
- Hey, Jack? - Hey, Mom?

57
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,802
早上好
Morning.

58
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,405
早上好  寶貝
Morning, baby.

59
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:36,644
嘿  親愛的  今天早上沒有車來接我
Hey, hon, the pick up still won't start.

60
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:37,745
你不介意順路把我帶過去?
You mind dropping me off on the way in?

61
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:38,880
好的
Sure.

62
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,553
- 你喂了巴羅了嗎?  - 是的  已經喂了
- Did you feed Burrow? - Yeah, I fed him.

63
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,927
好的  很好
All right. Good.

64
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,955
手電筒有作用嗎?
The night light worked, didn't it?

65
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:54,936
我自己來  爸爸
I got it, Dad.

66
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,813
今天你準備幹什麼  傑克?
What do you got going today, Jack?

67
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,145
沒什麼  還有幾天就數學考試了
Uh, nothing much. A math test in a few days...

68
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:09,584
今天體育課的時候要打棒球
and I think we're playing baseball in gym class today...

69
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,680
我希望我今天能打的更好
so I can look forward to sucking hard in right field.

70
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,315
好的  只要記住
Well, just remember...

71
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:17,182
別讓擊球手把球打飛過你的頭
don't let the hitter get the ball over your head...

72
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:19,821
除非是打出了場地
Unless it's out of the park.

73
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:22,855
是啊
Well, yeah.

74
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,055
我今天可以早點下班  我今天的工作只是
I get off early today. All I have...

75
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:55,792
沃森威爾得拖拉機銷售宴
is the Watsons-Willard Day bride's tractor sale.

76
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,595
你想要我來接你嗎?
You want me to pick you up?

77
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:00,327
是的
Yeah.

78
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,567
我們可以坐在汽車裡看電影  然後解決一些事情
Then we can go to the drive-in and make out tonight.

79
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:05,040
自從70年代就
There hasn't been a drive-in here...

80
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:07,270
這裡沒有免下車影院了  但是
since the early seventies, but...

81
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,171
我愛你
I love you.

82
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:12,738
我愛你
I love you.

83
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:15,274

That's wild.

87
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,043
- 嗨  湯姆  - 早上好  派特

Charles is going to be a little late this morning.

90
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:55,087
- 他又喝醉了?  - 是啊 我猜也是.
- Is he drunk again? - Yeah, I guess.

91
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,151
嘿  你約會過最瘋狂的女人是誰?
Hey, who's the craziest woman you ever dated?

92
00:09:58,195 --> 00:09:59,492
我?
Me?

93
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:00,791
是啊  麥克和我正在談論
Yeah. Mick and me, we were talking...

94
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,957
原來和我們在一起過的女人
about some of the girls we went with.

95
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,433
- 噢.  - 有次他和一個女人約會
- Uh-huh. - He once dated a girl...

96
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:06,959
那個女的在半夜企圖襲擊他
who used to attack him in the middle of the night.

97
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,472
- 她怎麼了?  - 是啊
- She what? - Yeah.

98
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,997
她經常做一些莫名其妙的夢
She used to have these crazy goddamn dreams...

99
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,134
夢見她的男朋友
where instead of her boyfriend...

100
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,643
變成了精神錯亂的殺人狂
I was some kind of demented killer.

101
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:18,580
有天半夜我醒來  她居然把一把叉子插在我的肩膀上
I woke up one night, she stuck a goddamn fork in my shoulder.

102
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:23,075
- 你在開玩笑吧  - 沒有  我血濺當場
- You're kidding me. - No. I'm spurting blood.

103
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,485
她就坐在那裡
She's sitting there crying...

104
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:27,149
哭說著  "親愛的 我愛你 我愛你"
going, "Baby, I love you, I love you."

105
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:30,617
然後怎麼了?  你和他分手了 對吧?
So, what happened? You broke up with her, right?

106
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,753
沒有  我和她結了婚.
No, I married her.

107
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,729
嘿  還在一起6年
Hey, it lasted six years.

108
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:39,633
人非聖賢  湯姆
Nobody's perfect, Tom.

109
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:42,900
我不這樣認為
I guess not.

110
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:50,303
把這傢伙打出局  我們準備好  開始
Strike this guy out. We got 'em. Let's go.

Little hero here, huh?

139
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,175
這裡的小明星
Little superstar here.

140
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:32,181
小英雄在最後一分鐘拯救了世界 對吧?
Little hero saves the day at the last minute, right?

141
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:34,740
博比 這只是個比賽而已
Bobby, it's just a game, OK?

142
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:37,480
只是一場愚蠢的體育課
It's just stupid gym class.

143
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:39,682
你說誰蠢?
Who you calling stupid?

144
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:43,784
呃  我是說體育課很蠢
Ahem. No, I said gym class was stupid.

145
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:47,285
"我是說體育課很...."  大家聽聽這個小同性戀說的
"No, I said gym class was..." Listen to this little faggot.

146
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,891
是啊 你說對了
Yeah. You're right.

147
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:54,563
我既渺小又是同性戀
I'm both little and a faggot.

148
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:56,936
你來找我麻煩是為了伸張正義?
You got me dead to rights.

149
00:12:56,973 --> 00:12:59,407
來啊 娘娘腔  這個這麼樣?
Come on, chickenshit, let's do this.

150
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,134
你到底要怎麼樣?
What would be the point?

151
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,148
我的意思是 算你贏了  你贏了 你贏了
I mean, you win. You win, you win.

152
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:08,913
你得到了你想要的地位
You've established your alpha male standing.

153
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:12,683
你讓我變的渺小
You've established my unworthiness.

154
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:15,782
不過這樣兇狠的對我 是不是有點..
But doing violence to me just seems... ahem...

155
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:18,794
有點殘忍和沒意思  你不覺得嗎?
pointless and cruel, don't you think?

156
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:20,591
你這個廢物臭婊子
Let's do this, you punk bitch.

157
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,033
是不是該說渺小的婊子同性戀廢物?
Shouldn't that be little punk ass chickenshit faggot bitch?

158
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,600
婊子同性戀廢物
Chickenshit faggot bitch.

159
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:33,234
噢
Uh-oh.

160
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,637
天啊
God!

161
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:44,553
博比才是真的渺小
Bobby is a chickenshit.

162
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,368
嘿  帥哥
Hey, good looking.

163
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,341
我們現在去哪裡?
Where are we going?

164
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:21,780
傑克在裘蒂·丹佛斯家學習
Well, Jack's studying over at Judy Danvers'...

165
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:25,818
莎拉有馬薩在照顧
and Martha's taking care of Sarah.

166
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,922
- 是嗎?  - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

167
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,295
那我們去哪裡?
So, where are we going?

168
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:39,831
我們好久沒有年輕的感覺了
We never got to be teenagers together.

169
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:42,208
是嗎?
Uh-huh.

170
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:45,146
待會兒你就知道了
I'm going to fix that.

171
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,924
你在裡面幹什麼?
What's going on in there?

172
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,984
別脫你的衣服 我馬上就好
Keep your shirt on. I'm coming.

173
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,472
我的天啊
Holy cow.

174
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:52,011
什麼?
What?

175
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:02,424
你需要有人來幫你嗎?  帥哥
Do you need some help with that, big boy?

176
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,758
呃  也許吧
Uh... maybe.

177
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,532
噢 我的上帝啊
Oh, my God.

178
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,337
你對我的妻子都做了些什麼?
What have you done with my wife?

179
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,906
好了嗎?  開始!
Ready? OK!

180
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,613
出發吧  野貓!
Go, Wildcats!

181
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:34,713
先生  這裡沒有妻子
No wives in here, mister.

182
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,662
- 嗷  - 唏
- Wow. - Shh.

183
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,726
小聲點  我爸媽都在隔壁
Quiet. My parents are in the next room.

184
00:16:58,214 --> 00:17:00,273
你這個淘氣鬼
You're naughty.

185
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,275
你在幹什麼?
What are you doing?

186
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:33,944
沒什麼
Nothing.

187
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,621
你真是個壞孩子
You are such a bad boy.

188
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,818
好啊 好啊 姐妹們 好啊 ?
Rah, rah, sis, boom, bah.

189
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:56,638
這種東西在中學裡可不多見
There wasn't much of that in high school.

190
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,573
啊
Ah...

191
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,827
怎麼了?
What is it?

192
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:34,171
我還記得我們原來相愛的時候
I remember the moment I knew you were in love with me.

193
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:39,342
我從你眼睛裡看到的
I saw it in your eyes.

194
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,010
我到現在都可以看到
I can still see it.

195
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,018
你當然可以
Of course you can.

196
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:01,363
我一直愛著你
I still love you.

197
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:16,048
我是世上最幸運的混蛋
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch alive.

198
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:22,717
你是我所認識的最好的男人
You are the best man I've ever known.

199
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:26,217
和幸運沒有任何關係
There's no luck involved.

200
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,808
[路人]你想下車去弄點吃的和其他的東西嗎?
You want to go down and get some food or something?

201
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:42,902
你想像過一百年前的孩子
You ever wonder what kids did for fun...

202
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:45,938
在週末的晚上玩什麼嗎?
on a Saturday night a hundred years ago?

203
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,416
我不知道
I don't know.

204
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,782
我原來經常想像
I guess I always figured...

205
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,343
他們偷偷駕著父母的馬車
they got into their parents' wagon...

206
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,218
在毒販和娼妓活動的街上來來回回
and went cruising up and down their main drag...

207
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:56,089
像白癡一樣的使勁的彈著班卓琴
playing loud banjo music and acting like idiots.

208
00:19:58,294 --> 00:20:01,388
這個就是你所想像的?
So, you think this is as good as it gets?

209
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:05,333
你是說我們嗎?  是的
For us? Yeah.

210
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:07,427
現在就差不多
For now.

211
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,169
實際上  我們長大了 有了工作 談戀愛
Eventually, we... we grow up, we get jobs, we have affairs...

212
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,267
還成了經常酗酒的酒鬼
and we become alcoholics.

213
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:22,774
呃  你要知道 有時候
Ahem. You know, sometimes...

214
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,787
你總是讓我更沮喪
you depress me.

215
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:30,659
嘿  我就擅長這個
Hey, that's what I'm good at.

216
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:41,331
給我
Give me that.

217
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:46,741
嘿  那邊不是那個姓史多的同性戀嗎?
Hey, isn't that that Stall faggot?

218
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,334
是的
Yeah.

219
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:52,005
你該去打他一頓
You should go kick his ass.

220
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:54,710
我會的
I'm going to.

221
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,128
他媽的 他是誰?
Who the fuck was that?

222
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,264
我不知道  我也不想知道
I don't know, and I don't want to know.

223
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:24,308
這個偏僻的小城讓我感到噁心
Can I just say how sick I am of these podunk towns...

224
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,815
誰會住在這個偏僻的小城裡?
and the goddamn podunks who live in 'em?

225
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:29,443
你知道嗎  如果你繼續這樣說的話
Do you think if you keep saying that...

226
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,611
這裡將會有一些變化
it's actually going to change anything?

227
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,951
這裡就是讓我感到噁心
I am so sick of this shit.

228
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:37,619
你在10`000英里前就這樣說了
Yeah, you made that clear about ten thousand miles ago.

229
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,786
如果現在你沒有更好的建議
Now, if you haven't got a better idea...

230
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:40,853
我不想再聽你說這個了
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

231
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:44,828
我們現在真他媽的窮
We are so goddamned broke.

232
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:48,268
是啊  那麼
Yeah, well...

233
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:50,272
這很容易辦
that's easy to fix.

234
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,305
沒門
No way.

235
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:54,570
- 來吧  - 不
- Come on. - Mm-mmm.

236
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,544
你今天晚上和吉米一起嗎?
Are you going to go shoot pool with Jerry?

237
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,809
可能吧
Maybe.

238
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:01,078
謝謝 湯姆  謝謝 麥克 你們一直那麼棒
Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Mick... good as ever.

239
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:03,813
再見
There you go.

240
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:05,582
教堂見
See you in church.

241
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,213
好的 願你們晚上過的好
Yep. Have a good evening.

242
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:09,451
你也一樣  回見 夏洛特
You, too. See you tonight, Charlotte.

243
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:11,357
好的 回見
Yeah. See you.

244
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:13,294
噢  對不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,695
噢  沒關係 老傢伙
Aw, it's all right, old fella.

246
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,862
朋友 我們打烊了
Just closing up, fellas.

247
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:27,842
黑咖啡
Coffee, black.

248
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:32,610
我也一樣  我還要些派  要檸檬味的
The same. I'll have some pie... some of that lemon meringue pie.

249
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:36,709
朋友們  不好意思  我們打烊了
Guys, guys, I'm sorry. I'm... We're closed.

250
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:39,980
我說了  咖啡
I said... coffee!

251
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:46,318
好吧
OK.

252
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:50,097
我覺得我們能做好的
I guess we can handle that.

253
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,601
咖啡不是很新鮮
It's not very fresh.

254
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:05,013
你可以回去了 夏洛特
You can go home now, Charlotte.

255
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:07,914
我來拿派就是了
Just leave the pie.

256
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:17,087
比利
Billy...

257
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:26,834
親愛的 你要在這裡留一會兒
You're going to be sticking around for a while, honey.

258
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:30,061
湯姆?
Tom?

259
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:37,107
他媽的別動
Don't fuckin' move.

260
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:49,155
先生 我們沒有  我們沒有太多的現金
Sir, we don't... we don't carry much cash here.

261
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:51,683
你們做什麼都可以
You gentlemen are certainly welcome to all of it.

262
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:54,287
混蛋 這我知道  相信我
Oh, I know that, asshole, believe me.

263
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,457
我很清楚
I do know that.

264
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:58,558
- 啊  - 閉嘴 婊子
- Aah! - Shut up, bitch!

265
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,032
好了 比利
OK, Billy...

266
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,066
讓這個混蛋瞧瞧我們不是說著玩的
let's show this asshole we mean business.

267
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,203
什麼?  她?
What? Her?

268
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:12,043
是的  她
Yes, her.

269
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,480
殺了她
Do her!

270
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:30,256
- 啊
- Aah! - Uhh.

271
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:08,331
我告訴你  那些人
I'm telling you, those men were...

272
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:09,895
他們要殺掉我們
They were going to kill us.

273
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:13,773
如果沒有湯姆的話  他們就殺掉我們了
They were going to kill us, and if it weren't for Tom...

274
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:14,833
他真是一個英雄
He's a hero.

275
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:18,244
....和國內幾宗謀殺案有關係
...in conjunction with several murders in those states.

276
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:19,771
湯姆·史多  一個居家男人
Now, Tom Stall is a family man...

277

我想採訪你幾個問題
I have a few questions for you. How did it feel...

303
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:08,523
當你面隊那些無情的殺人狂
when you saw the guns of those ruthless killers...

感覺不怎麼好
Not very good.

308
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,296
你自己也不驚訝嗎?
Were you surprised, though...

309
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:23,532
在那種情況下你有如此的反映

我的意思是說  任何人都會這樣做

那只是一件  一件可怕的事情
It was just... It was a terrible thing.

313

我覺得這事情都過了  我們最好快點忘掉
I think we'll all be better off when we get past it.

314
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:39,147

I just got lucky... very lucky.

327
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:22,522
當他們發現更新更火的新聞時
This will all blow over...

328
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:24,192
這一切就會結束
as soon as they find some other hot story.

329
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:28,465
是啊  說不定下個新聞就是萊頓發現了雙頭怪牛
Yeah. Maybe the Lydons will have another two-headed cow.

330
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:29,835
你們的想像力還不夠豐富
You guys aren't thinking big enough.

你們自己離開

389
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:55,367
沒什麼
It's all right.

390
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:56,969
沒關係

我不能收
I can't take this.

397
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:25,531
這對你來說沒什麼問題吧?
It shouldn't be any problem for you.

398
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:27,269
這是怎麼意思呢?
What is that supposed to mean?

399
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,301
弗加特先生只是在裡談談話

00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:13,751
他們覺得他們認識我
They thought they knew me.

546
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:19,855
他們把我認成了另外的人
They thought... I was somebody else.

547
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:21,691
嘿  真是怪異
Heh. That's weird.

548
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,961
是啊  夠怪的
Yeah. Weird.

549
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,867
我猜  呃  我猜
And I guess, um... Well, I guess...

550
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:30,564
他們不喜歡這樣的人  他們認為你就是這樣的人
they don't like this guy they think you are.

551
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:34,337
明顯不是
Apparently not.

552
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:37,539
我覺得  呃
And, um, and I guess l...

553
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:39,774
我猜  他們想
I guess... I guess they want...

554
00:43:39,814 --> 00:43:41,907
他們想殺了這個人  你就是這個人?
to kill this guy they think you are?

555
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,317
是的  這個就快讓我瘋掉的原因
See, that's... that's the losing my mind part.

556
00:43:45,353 --> 00:43:47,844
我的意思是  我沒理由那樣想
I mean, I have no reason to think that.

557
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:51,825
我只是想工作  你也知道
It's just I was down at work, and, you know...

558
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,627
突然  我想可能  可能是
suddenly I thought maybe... maybe...

559
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:59,224
他們只是過來看看而已
they'd come looking around.

560
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:00,564
你明白嗎?
You know?

561
00:44:03,505 --> 00:44:05,905
呃
And, uh...

562
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,068
你急急忙忙地跑回來救我們?
And then you came running back here to save us?

563
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,739
是啊  一些愚蠢的想法
Yeah, something silly like that.

564
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:16,108
我十分抱歉
I'm sorry.

565
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:19,018
如果你是正確的呢
What if you're right?

566
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:25,151
我們就只有面對
Then we deal with it.

567
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:17,871
看我找到了什麼?
Now, look what I just found.

568
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:20,972
這種款式的最後一雙  剛好合你的尺碼
It's my last pair in this style, and it's exactly your size.

569
00:45:21,015 --> 00:45:23,245
穿上試試  做夢都找不到這麼合適的
Just try these on. They should fit like a dream.

570
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:26,119
感覺怎麼樣?
How do they feel?

571
00:45:26,154 --> 00:45:28,952
很好 謝謝  我很喜歡
Good. Yeah, I think I like them.

572
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,389
我自己也有一雙
I have a pair of these myself.

573
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:31,653
真的很不錯  但真的也是最後一雙了
They look great and they really last.

574
00:45:31,693 --> 00:45:34,526
是嗎?  好的我買下了
Really? OK. I'll take them.

575
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:37,030
我還需要給她賣一雙
And I needed a pair for her as well.

576
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,397
莎拉
Sarah?

577
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:45,563
莎拉
Sarah?

578
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:47,472
- 呃  女士 這鞋子  - 我要找我的女兒
- Uh, ma'am? The shoes... - I have to find my daughter.

579
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:48,942
我不能讓你把鞋子穿出商店
I can't let you leave the store with the shoes.

580
00:45:48,977 --> 00:45:51,445
好的  好的  好的  莎拉
OK, OK, OK. Sarah!

581
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:54,807
莎拉
Sarah?

582
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:59,652
莎拉
Sarah?

583
00:46:10,031 --> 00:46:14,161
莎拉  莎拉  以後別在這樣了
Sarah. Sarah. Don't ever do that again, OK?

584
00:46:14,202 --> 00:46:15,567
對不起  媽媽
I'm sorry, Mommy.

585
00:46:15,603 --> 00:46:17,696
但你看  這裡有新款式的摩托車娃娃
But look. They have the new Vespa dolls.

586
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:19,229
沒什麼好擔心的  史多夫人
Nothin' to worry about, Mrs. Stall.

587
00:46:19,274 --> 00:46:21,139
我一直看著她呢
I've been watching over her.

588
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:24,373
你他媽的離我的家人遠一點  你這個狗娘養的
You stay the fuck away from my family, you son of a bitch.

589
00:46:24,412 --> 00:46:28,405
沒必要用這樣的詞語吧  史多夫人
There's no need for that kind of language, Mrs. Stall.

590
00:46:28,449 --> 00:46:30,508
我告訴你  我不知道你想要什麼
Listen to me. I don't know what you want...

591
00:46:30,552 --> 00:46:31,951
但我也不想知道
and I don't really care.

592
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:34,181
你應該關心我想要的東西  史多夫人
You should care about what I want, Mrs. Stall...

593
00:46:34,222 --> 00:46:36,816
因為我想要從丈夫那裡得到一些東西
because I want something from your husband...

594
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:40,988
那會影響你  甚至改變你的生活
that might affect you, might change your life.

595
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:43,190
我的丈夫不認識你
My husband does not know you.

596
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:45,426
他不會認識像你這樣的人
He wouldn't know you, somebody like you.

597
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:48,492
噢  他認識卡爾·弗加特  知道嗎?
Oh, he knows Carl Fogarty, all right.

598
00:46:48,536 --> 00:46:50,231
他對我再熟悉不過了
He knows me intimately.

599
00:46:51,806 --> 00:46:56,436
看到了嗎?  這只眼睛沒有完全的瞎
See? This isn't a completely dead eye.

600
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:58,809
還可以看到一點
It still works a bit.

601
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:01,212
問題是 我用這只眼睛能看到的唯一的東西
The problem is, the only thing I can see with it...

602
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:03,615
就是  喬依·崔瑟克
is Joey Cusack.

603
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:06,415
能把他看穿
And it can see right through him.

604
00:47:06,454 --> 00:47:08,854
能看穿你的丈夫  伊迪
Right through your husband, Edie.

605
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,849
看看他心裡到底怎麼了?  什麼讓他這麼規矩
See what's inside him, what makes him tick.

606
00:47:12,894 --> 00:47:14,987
那還是原來那個人
He's still the same guy.

607
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:19,159
- 不  - 他還是以前那個瘋狂的喬依
- No. - He's still crazy fuckin' Joey.

608
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,929
你也知道  不是嗎?
And you know it, don't you?

609
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:24,461
我所知道是  我的丈夫是湯姆·史多
I know that my husband is Tom Stall. That's what I know.

610
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:25,836
- 是嗎?  - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

611
00:47:25,873 --> 00:47:28,501
好啊  你怎麼不問問湯姆一些關於他哥哥瑞奇的事情?
Well, why don't you ask Tom about his older brother Richie?

612
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:29,669
他不....
He doesn't...

613
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:34,171
問問湯姆是怎麼用帶刺的鐵絲網把我的眼睛弄瞎的
Ask Tom about how he tried to rip my eye out with barbed wire.

614
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:36,547
問問他  伊迪
And ask him, Edie...

615
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:42,284
他是如何這麼會殺人的?
how come he's so good at killing people?

616
00:47:42,323 --> 00:47:46,225
如果讓我看到你在我5英尺之內
If I see you within five hundred feet of me...

617
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:48,729
或者是我的孩子和丈夫  我就只有讓你被抓起來
or my children or my husband, I'll have you arrested.

618
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:49,957
哼  哼  哼  哼  哼  哼
Heh heh heh heh.

619
00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:52,865
我還能對你講的再清楚一點嗎?
Can I possibly make myself any clearer than that?

620
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,666
不  不  史多夫人  你不會的  謝謝你給我這麼多時間
No, no, Mrs. Stall, you can't. I thank you for your time.

621
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:59,229
你有個可愛的女兒
You have an enchanting daughter.

622
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:03,175
還有  史多夫人
And, Mrs. Stall...

623
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:05,372
別忘了你的鞋子
don't forget your shoes.

624
00:48:05,413 --> 00:48:07,847
哼 哼 哼 哼 哼 哼
Heh heh heh heh.

625
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:09,349
你爸爸怎麼樣了?
So, how's your dad?

626
00:48:09,384 --> 00:48:11,875
我不知道  有點怪怪的
I don't know. A little weird.

627
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:13,682
是啊  在他經歷了那麼多以後
Well, after what he went through?

628
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:16,519
我是說  真的殺掉一個人
I mean, actually killing someone?

629
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:19,617
這足以讓任何一個人瘋掉
I mean, that's enough to freak anybody out.

630
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:22,289
是啊  我也覺得
Yeah. I guess.

631
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:28,435
你爸是條硬漢  對吧?
So, your old man's some kind of tough guy, huh?

632
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:30,596
他怎麼想他這個懦弱的兒子呢?
What's he think of his wimp son?

633
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:33,732
你覺得他能接受嗎?
You think he'd take this shit? You think he'd make jokes?

634
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:36,005
繼續啊  混蛋  說點好笑的啊
Go on, bitch. Say something funny.

635
00:48:36,044 --> 00:48:37,671
博比  別這樣
Bobby, leave him alone.

636
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:40,408
閉嘴 斯刊克
Shut up, skank.

637
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:43,076
啊噢  他要發瘋了
Uh-oh. He's gettin' mad.

638
00:48:43,117 --> 00:48:45,745
傑克 我們出去吧  好嗎?
Jack, let's just get out of here, OK?

639
00:48:46,988 --> 00:48:49,548
傑克  他是個混蛋  你知道的
Jack, he's an asshole. You know that.

640
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,115
他沒什麼其他的意思  我們走吧
He doesn't mean shit. Let's just go.

641
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,025
我們出去吧  好嗎?
Let's just get out of here, OK?

642
00:48:54,062 --> 00:48:57,088
是啊  女人  快跑啊
Yeah, puss. Run away.

643
00:48:57,131 --> 00:49:00,532
我敢打賭你的爸爸因你而感到恥辱
Goddamn, I bet your daddy would be real ashamed by you.

644
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:03,862
來啊  混蛋  說點好玩的啊
Go ahead, bitch. Say something funny.

645
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:06,567
讓我笑笑
Make me laugh.

646
00:49:21,456 --> 00:49:24,118
- 啊  - 噢
- Uhh! - Ohh!

647
00:49:25,993 --> 00:49:31,431
好啊  你這個他媽的傻瓜  過來  你這個狗娘養的
OK, you motherfucker! Get over there, you son of a bitch!

648
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:33,998
過來  你在笑嗎?
Come here. Are you laughin'?

649
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:35,798
你現在在笑嗎?
Are you laughin' now...

650
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:40,399
你他媽的混蛋
you motherfucking cocksucking piece of shit?

651
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,811
你到底在想些什麼?
What the hell were you thinking?

652
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:51,012
- 我沒想  - 當然沒想
- I wasn't thinking. - Obviously not.

653
00:49:51,052 --> 00:49:54,647
博比幾年來一直騎在我頭上  爸爸  他是個混球
Bobby's been riding me all year, Dad. He's a jerk.

654
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,016
他是個混球?
He's a jerk?

655
00:49:57,058 --> 00:49:59,083
是的  他是個混球
Yeah. He's a jerk.

656
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:01,857
不要找藉口  你打了他
That's no excuse. You stand up to him.

657
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:03,523
就差點沒把他送進醫院
You don't put him in the hospital!

658
00:50:03,564 --> 00:50:04,690
噢 沒什麼大不了的
Oh, big deal.

659
00:50:04,732 --> 00:50:07,530
隨便誰打了他都是一件好事
It's the best thing anyone could've done to him.

660
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:09,365
再說了  我只是被停課了而已
Besides, I only got suspended.

661
00:50:09,404 --> 00:50:11,167
這個事情夠大了
It Is a big deal!

662
00:50:11,205 --> 00:50:13,036
他父母說要起訴我們
His parents say they might sue us.

663
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:14,939
可以被告成蓄意傷人
There could be assault charges.

664
00:50:14,976 --> 00:50:16,136
我們負擔不起  傑克
We can't afford that, Jack.

665
00:50:16,177 --> 00:50:17,610
我們沒那麼多錢
We don't have that kind of money.

666
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:19,806
噢  什麼?  媽媽不會接這個案子?
Oh, what? Mom's not gonna take the case?

667
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:23,783
- 噢  不管什麼  爸爸  - 聽著 會說的小子
- Oh, whatever, Dad... - Listen, smart mouth!

668
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:26,946
我們家裡我們解決問題不靠打人
In this family, we do not solve our problems by hitting people!

669
00:50:26,988 --> 00:50:29,320
不  在這個家裡  我們只拿槍殺人
No, in this family, we shoot them!

670
00:50:36,898 --> 00:50:38,263
傑克
Jack.

671
00:50:48,843 --> 00:50:51,676
親愛的  你看到傑克了嗎?
Honey, have you seen Jack?

672
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:56,906
怎麼了?
What?

673
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,078
親愛的  怎麼了?
What's wrong, baby?

674
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,860
弗加特和他的手下跟蹤我們到了商場
Fogarty and his men followed us to the mall.

675
00:51:06,894 --> 00:51:08,384
他怎麼?
He what?

676
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:12,923
打電話給薩姆  我們該打電話找他嗎?
Call Sam. Should... Should we call Sam?

677
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,264
我們應該要打電話
We should call...

678
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:15,667
我已經解決了這件事情了  親愛的
I already took care of it, honey.

679
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:18,263
我已經解決了這個事情了  我去了法院
I already took care of it. Went down to the courthouse...

680
00:51:18,306 --> 00:51:20,433
拿到了逮捕令
got a restraining order.

681
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:22,534
那會起很大的作用
A lot of good that'll do.

682
00:51:22,577 --> 00:51:25,603
恩  只能這樣了
Well, it's something.

683
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:27,477
至少我們能逮捕他
At least we could have him arrested...

684
00:51:27,515 --> 00:51:29,107
如果他再在這個附近出現
if he ever comes around here again.

685
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:33,845
你是對的
You're right.

686
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:38,621
但是我要告訴你一些事情
But I have to tell you something.

687
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:41,621
什麼?
What?

688
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:46,322
這個叫弗加特的人始終認為
This man Fogarty really believes...

689
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:50,861
你就是喬依·崔瑟克
that you're this Joey Cusack.

690
00:51:50,905 --> 00:51:53,897
我是說  他今天下午告訴我的事情
I mean, the things that he told me this afternoon...

691
00:51:53,941 --> 00:51:56,466
- 什麼事情?  - 那些事情  都是胡說的
- What things? - Things. Just bullshit.

692
00:51:56,511 --> 00:52:01,949
但是他很肯定你就是那個人
But he's, uh, he's sure that it's you.

693
00:52:01,983 --> 00:52:04,645
我們必須要讓他相信你不是他說的那個人
And we have to convince him that it's not.

694
00:52:04,685 --> 00:52:09,713
我覺得他是不是對檢測我的DNA有興趣?
Well, I don't think he's interested in examining my DNA.

695
00:52:30,511 --> 00:52:32,376
放下你的武器
Get off our property.

696
00:52:32,413 --> 00:52:33,812
喬依 我們走吧
We'll go, Joey.

697
00:52:33,848 --> 00:52:35,839
我們只是你想和我們一起走
We just want you to come with us.

698
00:52:35,883 --> 00:52:39,011
回費城去見一些人
Come back to Philly, see some people.

699
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:42,250
我告訴過你  我沒有去過費城
I told you, I have never been to Philadelphia.

700
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,487
呵  你自己都相信你的廢話?
Heh. You almost believe your own crap, don't you?

701
00:52:45,526 --> 00:52:48,984
你這麼辛苦的裝成這個人
You know, you're trying so hard to be this other guy.

702
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,089
看起來真痛苦
It's painful to watch.

703
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,198
- 查理  - 是的
- Charlie. - Hey.

704
00:52:55,236 --> 00:52:57,636
看看我們找到了什麼
Look what we found.

705
00:52:57,672 --> 00:52:59,731
出來
Come on.

706
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:01,036
耶!  哈  哈  哈  哈
Yeah? Ha ha ha.

707
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:02,565
- 媽媽  - 傑克
- Mom! - Jack!

708
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,010
- 不要  伊迪 伊迪  - 媽媽
- No! Edie! Edie! - Mom!

709
00:53:05,046 --> 00:53:07,014
- 伊迪 不 不要  - 傑克
- Edie! No! No! - Jack!

710
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:08,811
讓我走  你這個混蛋
Let go, you son of a bitch!

711
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:10,111
過來
Come here.

712
00:53:12,053 --> 00:53:13,611
等等
Wait.

713
00:53:13,654 --> 00:53:15,781
媽媽
Mom.

714
00:53:16,924 --> 00:53:19,324
喬依  不要讓我們傷害孩子
Don't make us hurt the kid, Joey.

715
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,658
我只想你和我們一起旅行一下
We just want you to come for a little trip with us...

716
00:53:21,696 --> 00:53:23,288
沿著記憶之路
down Memory Lane.

717
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:26,858
放下你的玩具槍  過來和我們談談
Put the popgun down. Come over and talk to us.

718
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:28,368
親愛的  等等
Baby, wait.

719
00:53:28,402 --> 00:53:31,838
伊迪  我去把他接回來
Edie... I will get him.

720
00:53:31,872 --> 00:53:34,636
我去  求你了
I'll get him. Please.

721
00:53:34,675 --> 00:53:36,540
去照顧莎拉
Go up to Sarah.

722
00:53:36,577 --> 00:53:39,569
去照顧莎拉  去吧
Go up to her. Do it.

723
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:49,923
放下搶
Put the gun down.

724
00:53:54,962 --> 00:53:57,522
放下槍  喬依
Put it down, Joey.

725
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:05,170
走近點
Come closer.

726
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:12,636
再過來點
A little further.

727
00:54:19,286 --> 00:54:20,685
來吧
Come on.

728
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:37,399
傑克  回屋去
Go back to the house, Jack.

729
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:42,905
去吧
Go on.

730
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,480
你看  當你決定合作的時候一切事情都好辦了
You see how cozy it can be when you decide to play nice?

731
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:00,989
來吧  喬依  上車吧
Now, come on, Joey. Get in the car.

732
00:55:01,028 --> 00:55:04,293
你不用帶牙刷  我們一切為你準備好了
You won't need your toothbrush. We'll take care of everything.

733
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:07,562
我覺得你如果現在離開的話會更好點
I think it'd be better if you'd just leave now.

734
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:14,803
喬依
Joey.

735
00:55:25,486 --> 00:55:27,454
來吧  喬依  我們走吧
Come on, Joey, let's go.

736
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:35,318
- 啊  - 啊
- Uhh! - Uhh! Uhh!

737
00:55:35,362 --> 00:55:36,954
噢  噢
Ohh! Ohh!

738
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,199
湯姆
Tom!

739
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:51,101
媽的
Fuck.

740
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:55,208
媽媽  怎麼了?
Mommy, what's wrong?

741
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:06,120
沒什麼
It's OK.

742
00:56:10,164 --> 00:56:12,826
你死之前還有什麼好說的嗎?
You got anything to say before I blow your brains out...

743
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:14,459
你這個可憐蟲
you miserable prick?

744
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:19,696
我當時在費城的時候就該殺了你
I should've killed you back in Philly.

745
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:27,812
是啊  喬依
Yeah, Joey.

746
00:56:27,848 --> 00:56:29,975
你該的
You should have.

747
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:42,692
啊  啊
Uhh! Uhh.

748
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:12,112
伊迪
Edie.

749
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:21,256
親愛的  你還好嗎?
Honey, are you OK?

750
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:25,194
告訴我真相
Tell me the truth.

751
00:58:28,202 --> 00:58:29,897
真相?
The truth?

752
00:58:32,973 --> 00:58:35,908
求求你了  告訴我好嗎?
Please. You can do that, can't you?

753
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:42,747
告訴我好嗎?  求求你了
You can do that, can't you? Please?

754
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:45,013
你聽到了什麼嗎?
What do you think you heard?

755
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:47,987
不是我聽到的
It's not what I heard.

756
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:49,614
是我看到的
It's what I saw.

757
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:56,254
我看到了喬依
I saw Joey.

758
00:58:56,297 --> 00:59:00,529
我看到你在我眼前變成了喬依
I saw you turn into Joey right before my eyes.

759
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:05,431
我看到了一個殺人魔  弗加特警告過我
I saw a killer... the one Fogarty warned me about.

760
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:11,139
你在費城殺過人  對嗎?
You did kill men back in Philly, didn't you?

761
00:59:13,047 --> 00:59:14,742
你是不是為了錢才那樣做
Did you do it for money...

762
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:16,409
或者是你只是因為  因為你喜歡殺人?
or did you do it because you enjoyed it?

763
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:20,511
都是喬依做的 不是我
Joey did, both. I didn't...

764
00:59:20,554 --> 00:59:21,987
湯姆·史多不會這樣做
Tom Stall didn't.

765
00:59:29,196 --> 00:59:31,528
噢  我的上帝
Oh, God.

766
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:33,055
噢  我的上帝
Oh, my God.

767
00:59:44,278 --> 00:59:46,269
噢  我的天啊  這一切是真的
Oh, God, it's really happening.

768
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:53,686
你到底是什麼?  得了多重人格分裂症?
What are you, like, some multiple personality schizoid?

769
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:56,383
這些對你來說就像來來回回得開關電閘一樣簡單?
It's like flipping a switch back and forth for you?

770
00:59:56,423 --> 00:59:59,119
我也不想再看見那個喬依
I never expected to see Joey again.

771
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:01,957
噢  是啊  喬依
Oh, yeah. Joey.

772
01:00:01,996 --> 01:00:03,987
那他在躲什麼嗎?  還是他死了?
What, was he in hiding? Was he dead?

773
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:05,760
我想是這樣的
I thought he was.

774
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:07,664
我想我已經不是喬依·崔瑟克了
I thought I killed Joey Cusack.

775
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:09,669
我在沙漠死裡逃生的時候之後  我就不再是他了
I went out to the desert, and I killed him.

776
01:00:09,703 --> 01:00:10,829
噢  我的天啊
Oh, my God.

777
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:15,365
我用了三年的時間變成了湯姆·史多
I spent three years becoming Tom Stall.

778
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:17,434
伊迪  這些事情你應該知道
Edie, you have to know this.

779
01:00:17,478 --> 01:00:21,107
我遇到了你以後才如獲重生
I wasn't really born again until I met you.

780
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:24,283
我什麼都不是
I was nothing.

781
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,818
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

782
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,081
我不敢相信這發生的一切
I can't believe this is happening.

783
01:00:32,126 --> 01:00:33,593
我不敢相信這發生的一切
I can't believe this is happening.

784
01:00:33,627 --> 01:00:37,654
我不敢相信他媽的這一切居然發生了
I can't believe this is fucking happening!

785
01:00:39,466 --> 01:00:42,060
你不是在波蘭長大的
You didn't grow up in Portland.

786
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,295
你從來也沒提過你的養父母
And you never talk about your adopted parents...

787
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:47,739
因為你壓根就沒有
because you don't have any!

788
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:50,875
我們的名字
And our name.

789
01:00:50,911 --> 01:00:54,642
我的天  我的名字
Jesus Christ, my name.

790
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,241
傑克的名字  莎拉的名字
Jack's name. Sarah's name?

791
01:00:57,284 --> 01:01:01,778
史多?  湯姆·史多?
Stall? Tom Stall?

792
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:06,158
你亂編的嗎?
Did you just make that up?

793
01:01:06,193 --> 01:01:08,661
這個名字從哪裡來的?
Where did that name come from?

794
01:01:09,963 --> 01:01:11,624
我的意思是
I mean...

795
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,934
這個名字剛好可以用
it was available.

796
01:01:15,969 --> 01:01:17,436
是啊
Yeah.

797
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:30,245
我猜我也是剛好可以用  對吧?
I guess I was available, too.

798
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:13,025
嘿  傑克
Hey, Jack.

799
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:18,529
我現在該叫你什麼?
What am I supposed to call you now?

800
01:02:21,635 --> 01:02:24,001
你該叫我爸爸
You're supposed to call me Dad.

801
01:02:24,037 --> 01:02:25,698
我就是  你的爸爸
That's what I am... your dad.

802
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:27,206
真的嗎?
Are you really?

803
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:32,178
那種犯罪集團裡的爸爸?
So, you're some kind of closet mobster dad?

804
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:34,407
如果我搶劫了米里肯藥店的話
I mean, if I go rob Millikan's Drug Store...

805
01:02:34,448 --> 01:02:37,713
你會因為這個事情打我嗎?
will you ground me if I don't give you a piece of the action?

806
01:02:37,751 --> 01:02:40,276
是嗎?  爸爸  告訴我
What, Dad? You tell me.

807
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,550
別這樣  孩子
Please, son. Don't.

808
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:47,049
如果我把你的事情給薩姆說了  你還會打我嗎?
If I talk to Sam about you, will you have me whacked?

809
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,025
傑克
Jack.

810
01:03:52,526 --> 01:03:54,619
湯姆?
Tom?

811
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:57,027
嘿  薩姆  今天怎麼樣?
Hey, Sam. How are you doing?

812
01:03:57,064 --> 01:03:58,622
看到你康復了  我真是高興
Good to see you up and around.

813
01:03:58,665 --> 01:04:01,793
- 是啊  - 你能讓它跑起來了嗎?
- Yeah. - You had her runnin' yet?

814
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:04,030
是啊  還要等段時間
Yeah, for a second there.

815
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:06,562
它就可以活過來了
She's coming back to life.

816
01:04:07,641 --> 01:04:09,506
噢  媽的
Ah, shit.

817
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:13,038
湯姆
Tom...

818
01:04:14,915 --> 01:04:17,816
我有個問題
I got a problem.

819
01:04:19,553 --> 01:04:22,113
進去坐坐?
Want to come inside for a minute?

820
01:04:27,594 --> 01:04:31,189
我這幾天都在想這個問題
I've been running through it all for the last couple days.

821
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:35,964
我覺的這個事情不太合理
It just doesn't fit.

822
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,405
什麼不合理?
What doesn't fit?

823
01:04:39,439 --> 01:04:40,463
什麼都不合理
None of it.

824
01:04:45,545 --> 01:04:47,809
是伊迪回來了嗎?
Is that Edie coming home?

825
01:04:47,848 --> 01:04:49,679
是的
Yeah.

826
01:04:51,118 --> 01:04:54,019
好吧  我們現在先不說這個
Well, we don't have to do this now.

827
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:57,255
那最好
Might as well.

828
01:05:02,095 --> 01:05:04,154
嗨  薩姆
Hi, Sam.

829
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:05,892
伊迪
Edie.

830
01:05:05,932 --> 01:05:07,695
你好嗎?
How you doing?

831
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:09,964
我很好
I'm OK.

832
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:13,205
來點咖啡嗎?
You want some coffee?

833
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,832
不  我不要
No, I'm good.

834
01:05:17,844 --> 01:05:19,539
那麼  什麼風把你吹過來了?
So, what brings you out here?

835
01:05:19,579 --> 01:05:22,514
我和湯姆剛才在說那件事情
Well, Tom and I were just talking about that.

836
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:25,882
我也想聽聽
Mmm. I'd like to hear it.

837
01:05:27,154 --> 01:05:29,987
好吧  只是
Well, it's just that...

838
01:05:32,192 --> 01:05:33,386
我所說的不代表什麼意思
none of this makes any sense.

839
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:36,820
這些人都是些偷偷摸摸的人
These are serious secretive men.

840
01:05:36,863 --> 01:05:37,921
我是說  他們不會跑到這裡來
I mean, they wouldn't have come out here...

841
01:05:37,964 --> 01:05:39,454
他們不會跑到這裡來這樣做
they wouldn't have gone through all this...

842
01:05:39,499 --> 01:05:42,024
來暴露他們自己
exposed themselves like this...

843
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:44,902
除非是他們認定了他們找到了他們要找的那個人
unless they were dead certain they had the right man.

844
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:49,537
那麼 你到底想說什麼?  薩姆
So, what are you saying, Sam?

845
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:56,545
我只是說  我想知道真相
I'm saying I think I need to hear the truth.

846
01:05:57,818 --> 01:06:00,378
真相?
The truth?

847
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:07,554
是的  真相
The truth.

848
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:18,302
薩姆 你的時間比較充裕
Sam, you've got too much time on your hands.

849
01:06:19,473 --> 01:06:20,599
什麼?
I'm sorry?

850
01:06:22,075 --> 01:06:24,202
湯姆是
Tom is...

851
01:06:25,946 --> 01:06:27,470
湯姆就是他自己
Tom is who he says he is.

852
01:06:27,514 --> 01:06:30,005
就是這個意思
That's all that really matters.

853
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:34,111
薩姆  我們這個家遭遇的事情還不夠多嗎?
Sam, hasn't this family suffered enough?

854
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:40,925
好吧
Well...

855
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:42,553
真該死
goddamn.

856
01:06:45,832 --> 01:06:47,595
伊迪
Edie.

857
01:06:47,634 --> 01:06:48,999
好了
It's OK.

858
01:06:51,738 --> 01:06:54,605
我想我該走了
I guess I'll be going.

859
01:07:00,914 --> 01:07:03,348
如果你們需要什麼?明  給我打個電話就是
You folks give me a ring if you need anything.

860
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:10,922
隨便什麼事情  明白了嗎?
Anything at all, understand?

861
01:07:21,435 --> 01:07:23,596
謝謝
Thanks.

862
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:26,296
你
You...

863
01:07:27,974 --> 01:07:31,307
伊迪  伊迪
Edie. Edie!

864
01:07:31,344 --> 01:07:33,335
- 離我遠點  - 啊
- Get off of me! - Unh!

865
01:07:37,117 --> 01:07:40,245
去你媽的  喬依
Fuck you, Joey!

866
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:43,416
啊  走開
Aah! Get off!

867
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:09,505
我的天啊  我的天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

868
01:10:51,478 --> 01:10:52,877
喂
Hello.

869
01:10:52,912 --> 01:10:55,403
嘿  我的兄弟
Hey, bro-ham.

870
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:58,349
你仍然還是那麼會殺人
You're still pretty good with the killing.

871
01:10:58,385 --> 01:11:00,319
真是刺激
That's exciting.

872
01:11:01,388 --> 01:11:02,719
瑞奇
Richie.

873
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:06,590
對啊  我是瑞奇  你有什麼要說的嗎?  喬依
Yeah, it's Richie. What do you say, Joey?

874
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:08,617
是你來看看我?
Are you going to come see me?

875
01:11:08,662 --> 01:11:10,994
還是我來看看你?
Or do I have to come see you?

876
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,942
那應該是什麼意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

877
01:13:47,053 --> 01:13:49,317
呃  Jenny Cream (酒名)
Uh, Jenny Cream.

878
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:51,323
一瓶
Bottle.

879
01:14:32,098 --> 01:14:34,066
你是魯本?
You Ruben?

880
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,330
是的
Yeah.

881
01:14:36,369 --> 01:14:37,563
你是喬依?
You Joey?

882
01:14:48,781 --> 01:14:50,908
是的  我是喬依
Yeah, I'm Joey.

883
01:14:54,153 --> 01:14:55,814
我們現在做什麼?
So, what do we do now?

884
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,820
你先喝完你的啤酒
You finish your beer...

885
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:03,420
然後我帶你到艾斯卡拉德去見瑞奇
then I take you to see Richie in the Escalade.

886
01:15:24,584 --> 01:15:27,553
房子不錯
Nice houses.

887
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:30,750
瑞奇可是那種高層次的人
Richie's a very upscale kind of guy.

888
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,871
門也不錯
Nice gate.

889
01:15:48,908 --> 01:15:51,035
是啊
Yeah.

890
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,475
我們到了
We're here.

891
01:16:26,546 --> 01:16:29,140
家  溫馨的家
Home, sweet home.

892
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:00,938
我們要搜一下身
Got to frisk you.

893
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,948
不用了  別麻煩了
Nah. I'll save you the trouble.

894
01:17:02,982 --> 01:17:04,210
我什麼都沒帶
I'm not packing.

895
01:17:06,052 --> 01:17:07,280
我們要搜一下身
I got to frisk you.

896
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:12,057
好吧
All right.

897
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:13,888
我身上不怎麼好聞
I don't smell very good.

898
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:15,985
我開了很久的車  沒停過
I've been driving pretty much non-stop...

899
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:18,259
15到16的小時的樣子
fifteen to sixteen hours.

900
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:20,527
我會捏住鼻子
I'll hold my nose.

901
01:17:31,978 --> 01:17:36,776
你還相信那個叫Track & Turf的酒吧還在繼續營業嗎?
Can you believe that place is still standing the Track and Turf?

902
01:17:43,656 --> 01:17:45,817
你沒調戲那個叫吉利·立維的女人嗎?
Didn't you bang Jill Levy there...

903
01:17:45,858 --> 01:17:48,452
就在吧臺上  就在大家的面前
right on the bar in front of everybody?

904
01:17:48,494 --> 01:17:51,122
我從來沒調戲過吉利·立維
I never banged Jill Levy.

905
01:17:52,465 --> 01:17:57,630
你該那樣的  她還有點意思
Well, you should've. She was... She was something.

906
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:08,807
近來可好?  瑞奇
How you doing, Richie?

907
01:18:28,234 --> 01:18:29,724
不錯
Yeah.

908
01:18:29,769 --> 01:18:33,068
很久  很久沒看到你了
It's been a long, long time, bro-ham.

909
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:46,051
- 是啊  - 是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

910
01:18:46,085 --> 01:18:48,349
跟我來
Come with me.

911
01:19:00,867 --> 01:19:03,961
- 你想吃點什麼嗎?  - 不了
- You want anything? - Nah.

912
01:19:08,941 --> 01:19:11,808
你喜歡那樣的田園生活?
So, you like that farm life?

913
01:19:13,212 --> 01:19:15,612
擠牛奶  清理糞便?
Milking cows and shit?

914
01:19:15,648 --> 01:19:18,708
我沒什麼農莊
I don't have a farm.

915
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:20,844
沒有?
No?

916
01:19:20,887 --> 01:19:24,948
弗加特覺得你好象就是生活在那種農莊裡
Fogarty thought you lived on some kind of farm.

917
01:19:26,526 --> 01:19:30,519
還說可以聞到豬的味道
Said you could smell pig.

918
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:32,588
他怎麼可能知道
How that old fart would know...

919
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:33,997
豬聞起來像什麼  我也不知道
what a pig smells like, I don't know...

920
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:35,193
但他就那樣說
but that's what he said.

921
01:19:41,941 --> 01:19:43,966
你喜歡結婚嗎?
Do you like being married?

922
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,773
什麼?
What?

923
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:47,904
你喜歡結婚嗎?
Do you like being married?

924
01:19:49,682 --> 01:19:52,446
對你來說不錯吧?
Does it work for you?

925
01:19:52,485 --> 01:19:55,352
對我來說就行不通
I can't see it working for me.

926
01:19:55,388 --> 01:19:57,652
我從來沒有想結婚的欲望
I never felt the urge, you know?

927
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,557
世界上那麼多漂亮的女人
A lot of great looking women in the world.

928
01:20:00,593 --> 01:20:04,962
我從來沒有遇到哪個女人可以讓我放棄其他的女人
I never met one made me want to give up all the others.

929
01:20:04,997 --> 01:20:06,589
當然了 你可以到處風流
Sure, you can fuck around...

930
01:20:06,632 --> 01:20:09,032
還有很多的事情可以做
but it's so much goddamn work, you know?

931
01:20:09,068 --> 01:20:11,127
然後回家什麼都不說
Keeping it quiet.

932
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,195
那樣不值得
It's not worth the effort.

933
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,230
別那樣做
Don't see the upside.

934
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:19,039
你那樣做了嗎 喬依?
You see the upside, Joey?

935
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:22,546
是的 瑞奇
Yeah, Richie, I do.

936
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:25,781
我現在就是
I do now.

937
01:20:27,653 --> 01:20:31,555
兄弟 你讓我很生氣
I'm pretty pissed at you, bro-ham.

938
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:35,052
你該打個電話給我
You could've called.

939
01:20:35,094 --> 01:20:40,122
或者是寄張明信片來給我
You could've dropped a postcard in the mail.

940
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:43,135
我們是兄弟  你覺得會怎麼樣?
We're brothers. What'd you think would happen?

941
01:20:56,849 --> 01:20:59,977
我覺得我們該先說正事
I thought that business would come first.

942
01:21:00,019 --> 01:21:01,919
好吧
Well, yeah.

943
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:05,423
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

944
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:08,256
我知道
Tch. I know.

945
01:21:10,663 --> 01:21:12,722
我該怎麼辦?
What am I going to do?

946
01:21:12,765 --> 01:21:15,825
你惹到了一些有勢力的人
You bust up a made man's place.

947
01:21:15,868 --> 01:21:17,927
你殺了他幾個手下
You killed some of his guys.

948
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,438
你還弄瞎了他的眼睛
You take his eye.

949
01:21:20,473 --> 01:21:24,136
上帝啊  你弄瞎了他的眼睛
Jesus, Joey, you took his eye.

950
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:26,974
用帶刺的鐵絲網  是嗎?
Barbed wire, wasn't it?

951
01:21:27,013 --> 01:21:30,574
太糟糕了  你總是那個最瘋狂的人
That's disgusting. You always were the crazy one.

952
01:21:30,616 --> 01:21:33,585
- 再也不是了  - 是的  我聽說了
- Not anymore. - Yeah, I heard.

953
01:21:33,619 --> 01:21:35,211
你生活在你的春秋大夢裡
You're living the American dream.

954
01:21:35,254 --> 01:21:37,222
你已經開始做夢了 是嗎?
You really bought into it, didn't you?

955
01:21:37,256 --> 01:21:39,156
你做原來的你那麼久了
You've been this other guy...

956
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:42,490
現在也用了一樣的時間變成了那個人
almost as long as you've been yourself.

957
01:21:45,431 --> 01:21:49,424
嘿 你在做夢的時候
Hey, when you dream...

958
01:21:49,468 --> 01:21:52,904
你還是喬依嗎?
are you still Joey?

959
01:21:54,173 --> 01:21:56,334
喬依已經死了很久了
Joey's been dead a long time.

960
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:58,639
但你現在還坐在這裡
And yet here you sit...

961
01:21:59,845 --> 01:22:01,642
沒什麼區別
big as life.

962
01:22:04,617 --> 01:22:06,710
你要知道 你讓我花費了
You know you cost me...

963
01:22:06,752 --> 01:22:10,210
大量的時間和金錢
a lot of time and money.

964
01:22:10,256 --> 01:22:12,816
在你殺掉弗加特之前
Before you pulled that shit with Fogarty...

965
01:22:12,858 --> 01:22:15,452
我本來是要成為下一任老大的
I was a shoe-in to take over...

966
01:22:15,494 --> 01:22:19,089
而且是內定的
when the boss croaked... a shoe-in.

967
01:22:19,131 --> 01:22:21,929
我說的很清楚了  喬依
It was made very clear to me, Joey.

968
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:24,401
我不得不去收拾你留下的爛攤子
I had to clean up your mess...

969
01:22:24,437 --> 01:22:27,804
還要解決一些我從來沒遇到過的事情
or nothing was ever going to happen for me.

970
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,799
你根本不知道
You got no idea how much shit I had to pull...

971
01:22:31,844 --> 01:22:35,007
我是怎麼才讓那些人不來找我麻煩的
to get back in with those guys.

972
01:22:36,882 --> 01:22:39,510
你花費我
You cost me...

973
01:22:41,687 --> 01:22:45,748
太多  太多  喬依
a hell of a lot, Joey, a hell of a lot.

974
01:22:47,526 --> 01:22:50,495
看起來你已經解決了所有的問題
Looks like you're doing all right over here.

975
01:22:50,529 --> 01:22:54,124
是啊  對啊  對啊
Yeah, I am, I am.

976
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:58,535
我現在還是麻煩不斷
I'm still behind the eightball...

977
01:22:58,571 --> 01:23:00,402
就是因為你
because of you.

978
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:02,430
我們缺少了某種尊重
There's a certain lack of respect...

979
01:23:02,475 --> 01:23:05,000
缺少了某種信任
a certain lack of trust.

980
01:23:07,546 --> 01:23:11,539
那些在波士頓的人還等著我去呢
The boys in Boston are just waiting for me to go down.

981
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:20,285
你一直不斷的給我製造麻煩  喬依
You always were a problem for me, Joey.

982
01:23:20,326 --> 01:23:22,658
當媽媽把你從醫院接回來的時候
When Mom brought you home from the hospital...

983
01:23:22,695 --> 01:23:25,459
我就想把你掐死在搖籃裡
I tried to strangle you in your crib.

984
01:23:25,498 --> 01:23:28,865
我想所有的孩子都要那麼多
I guess all kids try to do that.

985
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:30,869
她發現了我
She caught me...

986
01:23:30,903 --> 01:23:34,202
我就沒好日子過了
whacked the daylights out of me.

987
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,970
我聽說過這個事情
I've heard that story.

988
01:23:40,246 --> 01:23:42,908
是嗎  你怎麼想?
Well, what do you think?

989
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:49,450
晚點總比不殺好?
Better late than never?

990
01:23:49,488 --> 01:23:51,251
瑞奇
Richie...

991
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:56,060
我到這裡來只是來尋求和平
I'm here to make peace.

992
01:23:56,095 --> 01:23:59,861
告訴我怎麼做才好
Tell me what I got to do to make things right.

993
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:04,229
我猜  你可以做一些事情
You could do something, I guess.

994
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:12,037
你死了就可以了  喬依
You could die, Joey.

995
01:25:08,334 --> 01:25:10,029
你怎麼可以失手?
How do you fuck that up?

996
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:16,265
你怎麼可以失手?
How do you fuck that up?

997
01:25:33,893 --> 01:25:36,589
你準備幹什麼?  給他人工呼吸嗎?
What are you going to do, give him mouth-to-mouth?

998
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:39,325
你看到我兄弟了嗎?
Did you see my brother?

999
01:25:39,365 --> 01:25:40,593
媽的 不要管這個
Fuckin' leave this...

1000
01:25:40,633 --> 01:25:44,330
我們一起去殺掉那個混蛋
and let's just kill that little fuck!

1001
01:26:45,931 --> 01:26:48,331
上帝啊  喬依
Jesus, Joey.

1002
01:27:11,457 --> 01:27:13,789
上帝啊 瑞奇
Jesus, Richie.
