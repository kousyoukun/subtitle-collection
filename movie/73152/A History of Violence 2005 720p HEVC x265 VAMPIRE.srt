1
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,410
So, we keep
headin' east?

2
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,150
Yeah, that's the idea.

3
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,020
Stay out of the big cities?

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
Uh-huh.

5
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,620
I think I'm tired.

6
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,220
Yeah.

7
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,360
Me, too.

8
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,930
Here.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Bring it on
up to the office.

10
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm going to go
check us out.

11
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,240
All right.

20
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,650
Nothing.

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,860
I had a little trouble
with the maid,

22
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,660
but everything's
fine now.

23
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,000
Damn.

24
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,900
8:00.

25
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,010
It's already this hot.

26
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,610
Yep.

27
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,880
How are we fixed
for water?

28
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,980
Probably not enough.

29
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,180
Yeah.

30
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,020
There's a cooler
in the back

31
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,190
in the office.

32
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,690
Hey.

33
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,830
Shh.

34
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,990
Aah! Aah! Aah!

35
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,680
Sarah, honey,
what's wrong?

36
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,650
Huh?

37
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,520
What is it,
sweetie? Hmm?

38
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,020
Daddy.
Yeah?

39
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,850
Daddy.
Daddy's here.

40
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,110
Daddy's here.

41
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,760
There were monsters.

42
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,190
No, sweetie.

43
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,030
There's no such thing
as monsters.

44
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,780
You were just having
a bad dream.

45
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,910
What's wrong, dad?

46
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,580
Hi, kiddo.

47
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,440
Sarah's just having
a bad dream.

48
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,390
Oh.

49
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,520
I saw monsters, Jack.

50
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,270
Monsters?

51
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,880
What kind?

52
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,330
I don't know. They came
out of my closet,

53
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,930
and then they were
in the shadows.

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,100
Mmm, shadow monsters.

55
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,980
Well, they look
pretty scary,

56
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,720
but they really
can't do anything,

57
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,390
especially when
the lights are on.

58
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,220
They're scared
of the light.

59
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,090
What happened, baby?

60
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,160
You OK?

61
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,360
I'm OK.

62
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,290
Sarah had a bad dream
about monsters.

63
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,290
Oh.

64
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,460
And I was telling her

65
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,330
that there's no such
thing as monsters.

66
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
Oh.

67
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm going to turn on
my night light just in case.

68
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,320
That sounds like
a brilliant solution.

69
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,720
Mmm.

70
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,110
Hey, Jack?

71
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,060
Hey, mom?

72
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,630
Morning.

73
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,470
Morning, baby.

74
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,690
Hey, hon, the pick up
still won't start.

75
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,570
You mind dropping me off
on the way in?

76
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,910
Sure.

77
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,130
Did you feed Burrow?

78
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,560
Yeah, I fed him.

79
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,800
All right.
Good.

80
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,030
The night light
worked, didn't it?

81
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,820
I got it, dad.

82
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,630
What do you got
going today, Jack?

83
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,800
Uh, nothing much.

84
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,070
A math test
in a few days,

85
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,270
and I think
we're playing baseball

86
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,470
in gym class today,

87
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,090
so I can look forward
to sucking hard

88
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,720
in right field.

89
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,570
Well, just remember,

90
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,240
don't let the hitter get
the ball over your head...

91
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,810
Unless it's
out of the park.

92
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,980
Well, yeah.

93
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,550
Bye.

94
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,870
I get off early today.
All I have

95
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,530
is the Watsons-Willard
day bride's tractor sale.

96
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,510
You want me
to pick you up?

97
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,150
Yeah.

98
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,380
Then we can go to the drive-in
and make out tonight.

99
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,850
There hasn't been
a drive-in here

100
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,070
since the early
seventies, but...

101
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,990
I love you.

102
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,560
I love you.

103
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,630
Have a good one.

104
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,080
You, too.

105
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,740
Morning.

106
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,990
Derek.

107
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,120
Hey, Tom.

108
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,490
Morning, Joseph.

109
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,340
That's wild.

110
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,710
Hey, Tom.

111
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,870
Morning, Pat.

112
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,370
Hey, Mick.

113
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,540
Tom.

114
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,110
Charles is going to be
a little late this morning.

115
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,500
Is he drunk again?

116
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,900
Yeah, I guess.

117
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,970
Hey, who's the craziest
woman you ever dated?

118
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,300
Me?

119
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,700
Yeah. Mick and me,
we were talking

120
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,770
about some of the girls
we went with.

121
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,770
Uh-huh.

122
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
He once dated a girl

123
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,690
who used to attack him
in the middle of the night.

124
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,910
She what?

125
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,280
Yeah.

126
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,750
She used to have these
crazy goddamn dreams

127
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,960
where instead
of her boyfriend,

128
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,470
I was some kind
of demented killer.

129
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,970
I woke up one night,

130
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,390
she stuck a goddamn fork
in my shoulder.

131
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,770
You're kidding me.

132
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,810
No.
I'm spurting blood.

133
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,290
She's sitting there crying,

134
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,190
going, "baby,
I love you, I love you."

135
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,430
So, what happened?

136
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,680
You broke up
with her, right?

137
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,800
No, I married her.

138
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,620
Hey, it lasted 6 years.

139
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,490
Nobody's perfect,
Tom.

140
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,840
I guess not.

141
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,200
Strike this guy out.
We got 'em. Let's go.

142
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,620
Yeah.

143
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,070
2 out.

144
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,560
One winning run
coming right up, boys.

145
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,190
Go, Bobby!
Whoo!

146
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,500
It's all right, Billy.

147
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,800
Look alive, look alive.

148
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,250
Yeah!

149
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,370
Ball.

150
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,910
Yeah, that's it.

151
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,430
He's got
nothing. He's got nothing.

152
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,360
Let's go, let's go.
One more. Come on, now.

153
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,330
Come on, Bobby.

154
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,330
Yeah.
He's yours, he's yours.

155
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,520
Oh!
Whoo!

156
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,470
Whoo!

157
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,360
Easy, Jack.
Come on, Jack.

158
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,010
Don't drop it, Jack!

159
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:38,860
That's yours. Come on.

160
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,980
Jinx, Jackie boy!

161
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,210
Oh!

162
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,330
Game over!

163
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,560
Yellows win.
Let's go, guys.

164
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,780
Taylor, Dietrich,
you're on equipment.

165
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,880
Let's go.

166
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,310
Guys, come on.
Let's go.

167
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,310
Good try, Bobby.

168
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,370
You was robbed, Bobby.

169
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,280
Everyone
hit the showers.

170
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,260
Awesome.
Nice.

171
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,130
Good job.

172
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,180
Guess you think you're
hot shit, huh, Stall?

173
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,920
What?
No, I don't.

174
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,120
Little hero here, huh?

175
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,890
Little superstar here.

176
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,970
Little hero saves the day
at the last minute, right?

177
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,640
Bobby, it's just
a game, OK?

178
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,190
It's just
stupid gym class.

179
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,580
Who you calling
stupid?

180
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,720
Ahem. No, I said
gym class was stupid.

181
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,180
"No, I said
gym class was--"

182
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,090
listen to
this little faggot.

183
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,690
Yeah.
You're right.

184
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm both little
and a faggot.

185
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,730
You got me
dead to rights.

186
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Come on, chickenshit,
let's do this.

187
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,050
What would be the point?

188
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,940
I mean, you win.
You win, you win.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,840
You've established
your Alpha male standing.

190
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,490
You've established
my unworthiness.

191
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,590
But doing violence to me
just seems--ahem--

192
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,660
pointless and cruel,
don't you think?

193
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,380
Let's do this,
you punk bitch.

194
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,570
Shouldn't that be
little punk ass

195
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,770
chickenshit
faggot bitch?

196
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,620
Chickenshit
faggot bitch.

197
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,240
Uh-oh.

198
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,460
God!

199
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,390
Bobby is
a chickenshit.

200
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,290
Hey, good looking.

201
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,650
Where are we going?

202
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,590
Well, Jack's studying
over at Judy Danvers',

203
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,630
and Martha's
taking care of Sarah.

204
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,260
Yeah?

205
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,760
Yeah.

206
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,460
So, where are we going?

207
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,600
We never got to be
teenagers together.

208
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,010
Uh-huh.

209
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,040
I'm going
to fix that.

210
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,720
What's going on
in there?

211
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,820
Keep your shirt on.
I'm coming.

212
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,450
Holy cow.

213
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,820
What?

214
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,250
Do you need some help
with that, big boy?

215
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,910
Uh...

216
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,650
Maybe.

217
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,360
Oh, my God.

218
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,130
What have you done
with my wife?

219
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,430
Ready?

220
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,700
OK!

221
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,350
Go, Wildcats!

222
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,530
No wives in here, mister.

223
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,460
Mmm.

224
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,180
Wow.

225
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,650
Shh.

226
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,540
Quiet. My parents
are in the next room.

227
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,870
Mmm.

228
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,150
You're naughty.

229
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,070
What are you doing?

230
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,760
Nothing.

231
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,400
You are such a bad boy.

232
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,400
Mm-hmm.

233
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,710
Rah, rah,
sis, boom, bah.

234
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,610
Oh.

235
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,450
There wasn't much
of that in high school.

236
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,420
Ah...

237
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,440
Mmm.

238
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,620
Uhh.
Mmm.

239
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,630
What is it?

240
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,700
Huh?

241
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,970
I remember the moment I knew
you were in love with me.

242
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,140
I saw it in your eyes.

243
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,810
I can still see it.

244
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,810
Of course you can.

245
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,160
I still love you.

246
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,790
I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch alive.

247
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,510
You are the best man
I've ever known.

248
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,010
There's no luck
involved.

249
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,560
You want to go down and
get some food or something?

250
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,660
You ever wonder
what kids did for fun

251
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,700
on a Saturday night
100 years ago?

252
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,130
I don't know.

253
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,530
I guess
I always figured

254
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,100
they got into
their parents' wagon

255
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,970
and went cruising up
and down their main drag

256
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,170
playing loud banjo music
and acting like idiots.

257
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,150
So, you think this is
as good as it gets?

258
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,310
For us?

259
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,080
Yeah.

260
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,180
For now.

261
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,190
Eventually,
we--we grow up,

262
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,920
we get jobs,
we have affairs,

263
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,060
and we become
alcoholics.

264
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,930
Ahem.

265
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,530
You know, sometimes,

266
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,570
you depress me.

267
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,770
Hey, that's what
I'm good at.

268
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,200
Give me that.

269
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,490
Hey, isn't that
that Stall faggot?

270
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,320
Yeah.

271
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,990
You should go
kick his ass.

272
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,640
I'm going to.

273
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Who the fuck was that?

274
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,110
I don't know, and
I don't want to know.

275
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,020
Can I just say how sick I am
of these Podunk towns

276
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,570
and the goddamn Podunks
who live in 'em?

277
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,240
Do you think
if you keep saying that

278
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,360
it's actually going
to change anything?

279
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,690
I am so sick
of this shit.

280
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,700
Yeah,
you made that clear

281
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,530
about 10,000 Miles ago.

282
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,320
Now, if you haven't got
a better idea,

283
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,790
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

284
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,600
We are so
goddamned broke.

285
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,010
Yeah, well...

286
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
That's easy to fix.

287
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,060
No way.

288
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,500
Come on.
Mm-mmm.

289
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Are you going to go
shoot pool with Jerry?

290
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,700
Maybe.

291
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,470
Thanks, Tom.

292
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,950
Thanks, Mick--
good as ever.

293
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,710
There you go.

294
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,320
See you in church.

295
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,910
Yep. Have
a good evening.

296
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,430
You, too. See you
tonight, Charlotte.

297
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,150
Yeah.
See you.

298
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

299
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,030
Aw, it's all right,
old fella.

300
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,770
Just closing up,
fellas.

301
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,910
Coffee...

302
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,580
Black.

303
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,750
The same.

304
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,580
I'll have some pie--

305
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,380
some of that
lemon meringue pie.

306
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,700
Guys, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm--we're closed.

307
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,650
I said...

308
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,890
Coffee!

309
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,340
OK.

310
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,880
I guess
we can handle that.

311
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,400
It's not very fresh.

312
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,780
You can go home now,
Charlotte.

313
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,700
Just leave the pie.

314
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,720
OK.

315
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,010
Billy...

316
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,810
You're going to be sticking
around for a while, honey.

317
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,550
Tom?

318
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,020
Don't fuckin' move.

319
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Sir, we don't--we don't
carry much cash here.

320
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,340
You gentlemen
are certainly welcome

321
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,650
to all of it.

322
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,040
Oh, I know that,
asshole, believe me.

323
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,340
I do know that.

324
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,430
Aah!
Shut up, bitch!

325
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,780
OK, Billy...

326
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,990
Let's show this asshole
we mean business.

327
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,150
What? Her?

328
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,850
Yes, her.

329
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,570
Do her!

330
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,290
Aah!

331
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,470
Uhh.

332
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,070
Aah!
Uhh.

333
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,160
Unh.

334
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,070
I'm telling you,
those men were--

335
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,640
they were going
to kill us.

336
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,610
They were going
to kill us,

337
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,490
and if it weren't
for Tom...

338
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,730
He's a hero.

339
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,000
...in conjunction
with several murders

340
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,980
in those states.

341
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,480
Now, Tom Stall
is a family man

342
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,920
with longstanding ties
to this community.

343
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,220
Tom Stall was just
another hard-working

344
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,890
small business
owner and operator

345
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,430
in Millbrook, Indiana,
but now--

346
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,310
um, one of the guys
had a...

347
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,700
A gun to my head,

348
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,930
and Tom--
he was amazing. He--

349
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,070
Hi, baby.

350
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,060
Hey, honey.

351
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,170
How you doing?

352
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,240
How are you?

353
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,130
Uhh.

354
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,930
Are you as sick of
hearing about me as I am?

355
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,370
No, I kind of like it.

356
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,700
Look.

357
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,060
Your picture's
in the paper.

358
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,520
Oh, God.

359
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,720
Careful.

360
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,110
Hi, guys.

361
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,610
Mom.

362
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,180
Can I--can I
get up now?

363
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,180
You got it, dad?

364
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,190
Yeah.

365
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,220
Way to go, Tommy.

366
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,690
We're all
here for you, Tom.

367
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,910
Way to go, Tom.

368
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,720
Hi, sweetie.

369
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,010
Oh, that's so nice.

370
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,910
Thank you so much
for coming.

371
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,770
We're in Millbrook,
just outside the home

372
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,900
of American hero
Tom Stall,

373
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,590
who's just now returning
from the hospital

374
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,440
with his family.

375
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,440
Mr. Stall,
Jenny Wyatt, WRPK news.

376
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,110
I have a few
questions for you.

377
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,280
How did it feel

378
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,150
when you saw the guns
of those ruthless killers

379
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,730
pointed
directly at you?

380
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,970
How did it feel?

381
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,640
Yeah.

382
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,770
Not very good.

383
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,770
Not very good.

384
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,010
Were you surprised,
though,

385
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,240
by your own reaction
to the situation?

386
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,310
Uh...

387
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,480
What I did was...

388
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,150
I mean, anybody
would have done that.

389
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,690
It was just...
It was a terrible thing.

390
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,220
I think we'll all
be better off

391
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,170
when we get past it.

392
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,830
Yeah, but you really went
beyond what the average--

393
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,390
I--I need to--

394
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,000
I really need to be
with my family.

395
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,800
Thanks.

396
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,770
I'm Jenny Wyatt
in Millbrook,

397
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,470
and that was Tom Stall--

398
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,100
American hero,
man of few words.

399
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,340
Well, I guess that's all
we're going to get.

400
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,780
Man, it's good
to be home.

401
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,250
I hope there won't be
too much more of that.

402
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,420
Hey, dad, they all just
want to interview you

403
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,420
because of what you did.

404
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,810
You're a hero, dad.
Ha ha!

405
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,780
No, I'm not.

406
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,150
I just got lucky--
very lucky.

407
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,250
This will all blow over

408
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,920
as soon as they find
some other hot story.

409
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,120
Yeah.
Maybe the Lydons

410
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,190
will have
another 2-headed cow.

411
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,560
You guys aren't
thinking big enough.

412
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,920
<i>You could probably do
Larry king live, dad.</i>

413
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,560
That would be cool.

414
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,060
Stop it.

415
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,160
Look at this--
more reporters.

416
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,950
Are they
still there?

417
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,100
Yeah. Now there's some car
parked across the road.

418
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,820
They're just
sitting there.

419
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,900
Huh.

420
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,900
Does anyone want some tea?

421
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll take some, mom.

422
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,440
Yes, please.

423
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,880
Unh.
Aw, jeez.

424
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,930
Hey, Edie.

425
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,130
Hi.
How are you?

426
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,230
Did you go
to the shop?

427
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,400
Yes, sir.

428
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Hello.
Hey, bill.

429
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,500
Hi, honey.

430
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,430
Hi, baby.
How are you?

431
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,970
Oh, I'm all right.

432
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,100
What brings you by?

433
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,510
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

434
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,340
Doing good.
Business is great.

435
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,340
Just can't keep up.

436
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,340
Yeah, it's busy.

437
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,310
Oh, look,
more reporters. Nice.

438
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,030
They don't look
like reporters.

439
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,550
Grilled cheese
is ready.

440
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,290
Got fries and
a strawberry shake.

441
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,030
Hello.
Welcome to Stall's.

442
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,060
Would you gentlemen
like some coffee?

443
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,510
You're the hero.

444
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,120
Uh, I don't know, sir.
I was just--

445
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,450
nah, you're
the big hero.

446
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,750
You sure took care
of those 2 bad men.

447
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,060
I really don't like
talking about it, sir.

448
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,410
We're trying to get
back to normal here.

449
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,680
So, can I offer
you gentlemen some coffee?

450
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,360
Sure. Give me some coffee.
Make it black...

451
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,480
Yes, sir.

452
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,180
Joey.

453
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,840
And--and
your friends?

454
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,300
They don't drink coffee.

455
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,910
It doesn't agree
with them...

456
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,640
Joey.

457
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,150
Who's Joey?

458
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,880
You are.

459
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,700
My name's Tom, sir.

460
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,570
Of course it is.

461
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,890
Mmm. That's
good coffee.

462
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,110
Thank you, sir.

463
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,420
If I were to find coffee
as good in Philadelphia,

464
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,390
but you know that,
don't you, Tom?

465
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,390
Heh.

466
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,190
No, actually,
I don't.

467
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,560
I've never been
to Philadelphia.

468
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,400
Pennsylvania? Is that where
you gentlemen are from?

469
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,570
Yeah, like
you don't know.

470
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,570
Sorry. Did--did we
know each other?

471
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,090
You tell me.

472
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,470
No.

473
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,070
We don't know
each other.

474
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,890
Come on, Joey.
Cut the crap.

475
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,240
My name is Tom.

476
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,640
Joey Cusack.

477
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,970
Your name is
Joey Cusack.

478
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,480
You're from Philly.

479
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,430
Mm-hmm. OK.

480
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,260
Whatever.
Uh-huh.

481
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,600
Excuse me, gentlemen,

482
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,100
if you're not going
to order anything,

483
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,170
my husband and I
would appreciate it

484
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,350
if you would be
on your way.

485
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,990
We ate
on the road.

486
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
It's all right.

487
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,680
It's OK.

488
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,030
We really are
very busy here today,

489
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,230
as you can see.

490
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,250
Um, so if you gentlemen
aren't going to be eating,

491
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,400
I really should offer your
seats to paying customers.

492
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,720
Hmm.

493
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,220
Well...

494
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,400
Now we're
paying customers.

495
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,720
I can't take this.

496
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
It shouldn't be
any problem for you.

497
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,100
What is that
supposed to mean?

498
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,260
Mr. Fogarty's just making
conversation here.

499
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,460
Well, whatever you
want to call it,

500
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,330
this conversation
is over.

501
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,660
I think he wants us
to leave, Mr. Fogarty.

502
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,890
Do you know
what he does

503
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,630
when he don't like people,
Mr. Fogarty?

504
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,210
Yeah.
I'm scared.

505
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,020
We should leave before he goes
all dirty Harry on us.

506
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,290
I want to thank you
for the coffee, Joey.

507
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,060
It really is very good.

508
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,480
It's Tom.
My name's Tom Stall.

509
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,860
Excuse me.

510
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,180
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

511
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,520
Hi--hi, Molly.
This is Edie Stall.

512
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,020
Is he in?

513
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,420
I'm fine, thanks.

514
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,170
You're calling Sam?

515
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,760
Yes.

516
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,970
Is there a problem
with my driving, officer?

517
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,480
Can I see
your license, sir?

518
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,150
Sure.

519
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,550
I thought I was
under the limit.

520
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,320
Is there some problem
I should know about?

521
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,410
What's your business
in Millbrook, sir?

522
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,080
We're tourists.

523
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,350
And what business did you
have at Stall's diner today?

524
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,550
We heard the coffee
was terrific.

525
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,400
Let me make something clear
to you and...

526
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,270
To Mr. Mulligan.

527
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,570
Uh-huh?

528
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,140
This is a nice town.

529
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,610
We have
nice people here.

530
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,980
We take care
of our nice people.

531
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,680
Do you understand me?

532
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,130
Yeah, sure.

533
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,450
Don't let me see you
around again.

534
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,150
You keep up the good
work, officer.

535
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,120
Charles Roarke,
Philadelphia.

536
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,950
Indicted on 3 counts
of murder.

537
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,760
Frank Mulligan,
out of New York,

538
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,190
indicted on one count
of murder.

539
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,710
Questioned in relation to
dozens of acts of violence

540
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,380
that you don't want
to hear about.

541
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,920
Both men work
for Carl Fogarty.

542
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,820
He's the fella
with the eye.

543
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,720
He spent 15 years
in prison

544
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,290
on several counts
of assault.

545
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,890
He's suspected in
half a dozen murders

546
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,290
and more disappearances.

547
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,750
Tom, these guys
are organized crime

548
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,850
from the east coast.

549
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,650
Now, they're
the real thing.

550
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,050
They're bad men.

551
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,940
Jesus.

552
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,670
Jesus, honey.

553
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,480
I have to ask you
a question.

554
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,950
Are you in some kind of
Witness Protection plan?

555
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,250
Sam.

556
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,480
Some kind of what?

557
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,080
This is no
laughing matter, Edie.

558
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,820
Of course he's not, Sam.

559
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,210
I'd just like to
hear Tom say that.

560
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,180
OK. No. No, I'm not
in a witness program.

561
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,930
Those men just have
the wrong guy.

562
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,220
They must've seen me on TV,
and I guess, uh,

563
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,240
I reminded them
of this Johnny guy.

564
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,440
Joey.
J-Joey somebody.

565
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,910
I mean, good lord.
The idea of me--

566
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,730
I never honestly
believed it,

567
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,460
but I had to ask.

568
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,070
I've done
some research

569
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,720
on this, uh,
Joey Cusack.

570
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,020
I didn't find
anything.

571
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,670
But there is
a Richie Cusack

572
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,510
in Philadelphia.

573
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,740
Apparently,
he's the head

574
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,210
of some kind of
crime syndicate

575
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,780
in that city.

576
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,880
Men like this
come to our town

577
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,280
and start harassing
a citizen,

578
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,750
we have to
take them seriously.

579
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,380
Sure.

580
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,250
All right.
So, if you folks

581
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,790
see them
coming around,

582
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,320
you let me know.

583
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,560
Will do.

584
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,090
I'm sorry, Sam.

585
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,800
Do you want a piece
of pie or something?

586
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,260
Ah, no, thanks, Edie.

587
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,070
I'd love to, but I've
gotta get back to work.

588
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,030
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.

589
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,640
Uh, Sam?

590
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,790
Thank you.

591
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,090
It's good to know you're
watching out for us.

592
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,560
Come on, Tom.

593
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,260
You know we look out
for our own here.

594
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,810
Good night.

595
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,330
Good night.

596
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,570
See ya. Thanks.

597
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,480
Huh.

598
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,930
Don't worry.

599
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,570
They're as good as gone.

600
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,530
Sorry.

601
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,230
Sorry.

602
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,330
It's over
and done with.

603
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,220
OK.

604
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,880
Honey. Can you
get that, hon?

605
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,150
Come on, come on!

606
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,950
Hello?

607
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,900
The shotgun, Edie!
Get the shotgun!

608
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,470
Tom, Tom--
Tom, what's wrong?

609
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,260
They're coming
to the house!

610
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,310
Who's coming to the house?

611
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,980
Just grab it!
Do it and be ready!

612
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,340
OK, stop. Are you serious?

613
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,540
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

614
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,370
Shit.

615
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,310
Come on.

616
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,740
Oh, shit.

617
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,440
Oh, come on.

618
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,480
Come on.

619
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,100
Edie!

620
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,730
Oh.

621
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,890
Ohh, fuck. Tom!

622
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,520
Tom. Tom,
what's going on?

623
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,690
I--
huh?

624
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,960
I--I don't know,
baby.

625
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,110
Jesus.

626
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,230
What's going on?

627
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,320
I don't--I don't know.

628
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,520
Ohh.

629
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,300
Let me call Sam,
all right?

630
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,070
No, don't.
OK.

631
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,310
I--I don't even know--

632
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,210
I--I don't know why
I thought--

633
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,680
I--

634
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,530
mom?

635
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,950
It's OK, baby.

636
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,190
Yeah. Uh...Ha ha.

637
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,190
I--

638
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,700
I--I--I think
I'm losing my mind.

639
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,130
No, no, no. OK.

640
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
You're not
losing your mind.

641
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,000
You've been through
some serious trauma.

642
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,400
All right?

643
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm here for you, baby.
We're all here for you.

644
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,940
It's all right.
It's gonna be OK.

645
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,750
Mom?

646
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,790
You haven't forgotten about
my new shoes, have you?

647
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,860
Gosh, no.

648
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,460
It's my top priority
for the day.

649
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,860
How could I forget?
You all right?

650
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,160
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,900
Hi--hi, sweetie.

652
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,630
Honey, just get ready
for school.

653
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,470
I'll speak to you
afterwards, all right?

654
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,870
OK.

655
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,160
Come on.

656
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,320
Let's go shopping.

657
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,540
Hey.

658
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,360
Careful. It's loaded.

659
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:36,860
Why was mom running
around the house with that?

660
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,980
What's going on, dad?

661
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,510
False alarm.

662
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,460
Nothing to worry about.

663
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,360
<i>I am worried.</i>

664
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,400
You're sweating.
You're soaked, dad.

665
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,170
What kind of
false alarm?

666
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,820
What did you mean,
you think you--

667
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,470
you think you're
losing your mind?

668
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,690
Some mob guys
showed up at the diner.

669
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,000
They saw me on TV,

670
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,300
and they came by
to take a look at me.

671
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,980
Yeah.

672
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,950
Yeah, I heard
about that. Uh...

673
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,090
So...

674
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,500
They thought
they knew me.

675
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,440
They thought...

676
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,610
I was somebody else.

677
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,390
Heh. That's weird.

678
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,730
Yeah. Weird.

679
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,480
And I guess, um...
Well, I guess

680
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,820
they don't like this guy
they think you are.

681
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,960
Apparently not.

682
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,180
And, um,
and I guess I--

683
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,410
I guess--
I guess they want

684
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,610
to kill this guy
they think you are?

685
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,950
See, that's--that's
the losing my mind part.

686
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,420
I mean, I have no reason
to think that.

687
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,500
It's just...

688
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,440
I was down at work,
and, you know,

689
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,240
suddenly I thought
maybe--

690
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,260
maybe...

691
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,860
They'd come
looking around.

692
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,230
You know?

693
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,530
And, uh...

694
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,700
And then you came running
back here to save us?

695
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,410
Yeah,
something silly like that.

696
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,980
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,710
What if you're right?

698
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,800
Then we deal with it.

699
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,000
OK.

700
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,480
Now,
look what I just found.

701
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,320
It's my last pair
in this style,

702
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,590
and it's exactly
your size.

703
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,890
Just try these on.
They should fit like a dream.

704
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,720
How do they feel?

705
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,560
Good. Yeah,
I think I like them.

706
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,940
I have a pair
of these myself.

707
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,330
They look great
and they really last.

708
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,150
Really? OK.
I'll take them.

709
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,680
And I needed a pair
for her as well.

710
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,050
Sarah?

711
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,190
Sarah?

712
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,410
Uh, ma'am?
The shoes--

713
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,660
I have to find
my daughter.

714
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,290
I can't let you leave
the store with the shoes.

715
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,160
OK, OK, OK. Sarah!

716
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,450
Sarah?

717
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,290
Sarah?

718
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,080
Sarah. Sarah...

719
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,780
Don't ever
do that again, OK?

720
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,190
I'm sorry, mommy.

721
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,220
But look. They have
the new Vespa dolls.

722
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,870
Nothin' to worry about,
Mrs. Stall.

723
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,760
I've been watching
over her.

724
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,560
You stay the fuck
away from my family,

725
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,980
you son of a bitch.

726
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,850
There's no need
for that kind of language,

727
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,210
Mrs. Stall.

728
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,130
Listen to me.
I don't know what you want,

729
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,800
and I don't really care.

730
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,740
You should care about
what I want, Mrs. Stall,

731
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,350
because I want something
from your husband

732
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,040
that might affect you,

733
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,810
might change your life.

734
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,790
My husband
does not know you.

735
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,060
He wouldn't know you,
somebody like you.

736
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,120
Oh, he knows
Carl Fogarty, all right.

737
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,920
He knows me intimately.

738
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,690
See?

739
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,060
This isn't
a completely dead eye.

740
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,430
It still works a bit.

741
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,830
The problem is, the only
thing I can see with it

742
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,140
is Joey Cusack.

743
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,130
And it can see
right through him.

744
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,470
Right through
your husband, Edie.

745
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,470
See what's inside him,
what makes him tick.

746
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,810
He's still the same guy.

747
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,790
No.

748
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,780
He's still
crazy fuckin' Joey.

749
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,710
And you know it,
don't you?

750
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,010
I know that my husband
is Tom Stall.

751
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,280
That's what I know.

752
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,180
Yeah?
Yeah.

753
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,650
Well, why don't
you ask Tom

754
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,350
about his older
brother Richie?

755
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,200
He doesn't--

756
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,770
ask Tom about how he tried
to rip my eye out

757
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,920
with barbed wire.

758
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,060
And ask him, Edie,

759
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:40,110
how come he's so good
at killing people?

760
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,830
If I see you
within 500 feet of me

761
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,300
or my children or my husband,
I'll have you arrested.

762
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,570
Heh heh heh heh.

763
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,470
Can I possibly make myself
any clearer than that?

764
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,940
No, no, Mrs. Stall,
you can't.

765
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,180
I thank you
for your time.

766
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,880
You have
an enchanting daughter.

767
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,820
And, Mrs. Stall...

768
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,150
Don't forget
your shoes.

769
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,440
Heh heh heh heh.

770
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,950
So,
how's your dad?

771
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,490
I don't know.
A little weird.

772
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,290
Well, after what
he went through?

773
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,130
I mean, actually
killing someone?

774
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,230
I mean, that's enough
to freak anybody out.

775
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,900
Yeah. I guess.

776
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,020
So, your old man's some
kind of tough guy, huh?

777
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,190
What's he think
of his wimp son?

778
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,290
You think
he'd take this shit?

779
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,340
You think
he'd make jokes?

780
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,790
Go on, bitch.
Say something funny.

781
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,450
Bobby, leave him alone.

782
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,020
Shut up, skank.

783
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,600
Uh-oh.
He's gettin' mad.

784
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,620
Jack, let's just
get out of here, OK?

785
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,340
Jack, he's an asshole.
You know that.

786
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,730
He doesn't mean shit.
Let's just go.

787
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,630
Let's just
get out of here, OK?

788
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,700
Yeah, puss.
Run away.

789
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,270
Goddamn,
I bet your daddy

790
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,130
would be real
ashamed by you.

791
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,490
Go ahead, bitch.
Say something funny.

792
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,370
Make me laugh.

793
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:20,050
Uhh!

794
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,670
Ohh!

795
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,540
Uhh!

796
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,530
OK,
you motherfucker!

797
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:29,180
Get over there,
you son of a bitch!

798
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,310
Ohh!

799
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,650
Come here.
Are you laughin'?

800
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,450
Are you laughin' now,

801
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,220
you motherfucking
cocksucking piece of shit?!

802
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,480
What the hell
were you thinking?

803
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,110
I wasn't thinking.

804
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,730
Obviously not.

805
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,070
Bobby's been riding me
all year, dad.

806
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,430
He's a jerk.

807
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,700
He's a jerk?

808
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,670
Yeah. He's a jerk.

809
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,360
That's no excuse.
You stand up to him.

810
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,110
You don't put him
in the hospital!

811
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,910
Oh, big deal.
It's the best thing

812
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,160
anyone could've
done to him.

813
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,050
Besides,
I only got suspended.

814
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,750
<i>It is a big deal!</i>

815
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,620
His parents say
they might sue us.

816
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,790
There could be
assault charges.

817
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,740
We can't
afford that, Jack.

818
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,170
We don't have
that kind of money.

819
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,410
Oh, what? Mom's not
gonna take the case?

820
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:18,610
Oh, whatever, dad--

821
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,540
listen, smart mouth!

822
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,340
In this family, we do
not solve our problems

823
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,710
by hitting people!

824
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,950
No, in this family,
we shoot them!

825
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,200
Ah!

826
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,870
Jack.

827
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,470
Honey,
have you seen Jack?

828
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,570
What?

829
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,690
What's wrong, baby?

830
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,480
Fogarty and his men
followed us to the mall.

831
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,250
He what?

832
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,720
Call Sam. Should--
should we call Sam?

833
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,840
We should call--

834
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,240
I already
took care of it, honey.

835
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,060
I already took care of it.
Went down to the courthouse,

836
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,180
got a restraining order.

837
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,310
A lot of good
that'll do.

838
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,200
Well, it's something.

839
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,070
At least
we could have him arrested

840
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,940
if he ever
comes around here again.

841
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,460
You're right.

842
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,230
But I have
to tell you something.

843
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,230
What?

844
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,900
This man Fogarty
really believes

845
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:47,040
that you're
this Joey Cusack.

846
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,620
I mean...

847
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,490
The things that he told me
this afternoon--

848
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,630
what things?

849
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,040
Things. Just bullshit.

850
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,450
But he's, uh...

851
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,530
He's sure that it's you.

852
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,270
And we have to convince him
that it's not.

853
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,020
Well, I don't think
he's interested

854
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,590
in examining my DNA.

855
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,940
Get off our property.

856
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,480
We'll go, Joey.

857
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,360
We just want you
to come with us.

858
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,710
Come back to Philly,
see some people.

859
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,770
I told you,

860
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,990
I have never been
to Philadelphia.

861
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,970
Heh. You almost believe
your own crap, don't you?

862
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,560
You know, you're trying
so hard to be this other guy.

863
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,690
It's painful to watch.

864
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,900
Charlie.
Hey.

865
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,200
Look what we found.

866
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,300
Come on.

867
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:58,700
Yeah?
Ha ha ha.

868
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,100
Mom!
Jack!

869
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,710
No! Edie! Edie!
Mom!

870
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,570
Edie! No! No!
Jack!

871
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,380
Let go,
you son of a bitch!

872
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,710
Come here.

873
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,410
Wait.

874
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,400
Mom.

875
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,920
Don't make us
hurt the kid, Joey.

876
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,240
We just want you to come
for a little trip with us

877
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,870
down memory Lane.

878
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:24,640
Put the popgun down.
Come over and talk to us.

879
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,930
Baby, wait.

880
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,400
Edie...
I will get him.

881
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,200
I'll get him.
Please.

882
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,100
Go up to Sarah.

883
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,170
Go up to her.
Do it.

884
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,600
Put the gun down.

885
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,120
Put it down, Joey.

886
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,780
Come closer.

887
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,250
A little further.

888
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,270
Come on.

889
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,190
Go back to the house, Jack.

890
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,630
Go on.

891
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,570
You see how cozy
it can be

892
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,040
when you decide
to play nice?

893
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,540
Now, come on, Joey.
Get in the car.

894
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,050
You won't need
your toothbrush.

895
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,010
We'll take care
of everything.

896
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,280
I think it'd be better
if you'd just leave now.

897
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,410
Joey.

898
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,050
Come on, Joey,
let's go.

899
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,940
Ahh!

900
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,790
Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!

901
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,630
Ohh! Ohh!

902
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,160
Uhh!

903
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,930
Tom!

904
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,670
Fuck.

905
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,960
Mommy, what's wrong?

906
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,890
It's OK.

907
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,380
You got anything to say
before I blow your brains out,

908
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,180
you miserable prick?

909
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,300
I should've killed you
back in Philly.

910
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:25,360
Yeah, Joey.

911
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,690
You should have.

912
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,520
Uhh!

913
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,250
Uhh.

914
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,920
Edie.

915
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,920
Honey, are you OK?

916
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,810
Tell me the truth.

917
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,470
The truth?

918
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,490
Please. You can
do that, can't you?

919
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,290
You can do that,
can't you? Please?

920
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,660
What do you think
you heard?

921
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,520
It's not what I heard.

922
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,420
It's what I saw.

923
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,790
I saw Joey.

924
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:58,090
I saw you turn into Joey
right before my eyes.

925
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:03,000
I saw a killer--the one
Fogarty warned me about.

926
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,800
You did kill men
back in Philly,

927
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,870
didn't you?

928
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,290
Did you do it for money,

929
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,090
or did you do it
because you enjoyed it?

930
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,210
Joey did, both.

931
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,050
I didn't--

932
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:19,810
Tom Stall didn't.

933
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,050
Oh, God.

934
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,620
Oh, my God.

935
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,820
Oh, God, it's
really happening.

936
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:45,520
Oh.

937
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,060
What are you,

938
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,420
like, some multiple
personality schizoid?

939
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,630
It's like flipping
a switch

940
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,060
back and forth for you?

941
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,760
I never expected
to see Joey again.

942
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,480
Oh, yeah. Joey.

943
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,520
What, was he in hiding?
Was he dead?

944
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,490
I thought he was.

945
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,190
I thought I killed
Joey Cusack.

946
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,110
I went out to the desert,
and I killed him.

947
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,320
Oh, my God.

948
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:12,990
I spent 3 years
becoming Tom Stall.

949
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,930
Edie, you have
to know this.

950
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,680
I wasn't really born again
until I met you.

951
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,890
I was nothing.

952
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,370
I don't believe you.

953
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,630
I can't believe
this is happening.

954
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,130
I can't believe
this is happening.

955
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,230
I can't believe this is
fucking happening!

956
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,620
You didn't grow up
in Portland.

957
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,820
And you never talk about
your adopted parents

958
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,290
because
you don't have any!

959
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,390
And our name.

960
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,160
Jesus Christ,
my name.

961
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,770
Jack's name.
Sarah's name?

962
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:59,350
Stall? Tom Stall?

963
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,690
Did you just
make that up?

964
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,290
Where did that name
come from?

965
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,180
I mean...

966
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,580
It was available.

967
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,000
Yeah.

968
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,800
I guess
I was available, too.

969
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,580
Hey, Jack.

970
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:16,090
What am I supposed
to call you now?

971
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,530
You're supposed
to call me dad.

972
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,300
That's what I am--
your dad.

973
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:24,700
Are you really?

974
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,750
So, you're some kind of
closet mobster dad?

975
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,840
I mean, if I go rob
Millikan's drug store,

976
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,160
will you ground me

977
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,220
if I don't give you
a piece of the action?

978
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,960
What, dad?
You tell me.

979
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,190
Please, son.
Don't.

980
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,380
If I talk to Sam
about you,

981
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,620
will you
have me whacked?

982
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,590
Jack.

983
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,130
Tom?

984
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:54,530
Hey, Sam.
How are you doing?

985
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,300
Good to see you
up and around.

986
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,450
Yeah.

987
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,480
You had her
runnin' yet?

988
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:01,550
Yeah,
for a second there.

989
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,890
She's coming back
to life.

990
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,060
Ah, shit.

991
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,630
Tom...

992
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:15,380
I got a problem.

993
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,730
Want to come inside
for a minute?

994
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,610
I've been running
through it all

995
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,780
for the last couple days.

996
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,550
It just doesn't fit.

997
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,920
What doesn't fit?

998
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,270
None of it.

999
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,390
Is that Edie
coming home?

1000
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,260
Yeah.

1001
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,630
Well, we don't have
to do this now.

1002
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,900
Might as well.

1003
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,720
Hi, Sam.

1004
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,410
Edie.

1005
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,410
How you doing?

1006
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,510
I'm OK.

1007
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,710
You want some coffee?

1008
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,580
No, I'm good.

1009
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,100
So, what brings you
out here?

1010
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,020
Well, Tom and I were just
talking about that.

1011
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,590
Mmm.

1012
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,490
I'd like to hear it.

1013
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,510
Well, it's just that...

1014
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,020
None of this
makes any sense.

1015
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,770
Mmm.

1016
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,340
These are serious
secretive men.

1017
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,570
I mean, they wouldn't have
come out here,

1018
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,220
they wouldn't have
gone through all this,

1019
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,720
exposed themselves
like this

1020
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,480
unless they were dead certain
they had the right man.

1021
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,280
So, what are you
saying, Sam?

1022
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:54,090
I'm saying I think
I need to hear the truth.

1023
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,990
The truth?

1024
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,350
The truth.

1025
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,970
Sam, you've got too much
time on your hands.

1026
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,260
I'm sorry?

1027
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,740
Tom is...

1028
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,050
Tom is
who he says he is.

1029
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,770
That's all
that really matters.

1030
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:31,840
Sam, hasn't this family
suffered enough?

1031
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,530
Well...

1032
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,090
Goddamn.

1033
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,100
Edie.

1034
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:46,730
It's OK.

1035
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,360
I guess I'll be going.

1036
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,080
You folks give me a ring
if you need anything.

1037
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:08,450
Anything at all,
understand?

1038
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,130
Thanks.

1039
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,830
You...

1040
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,070
Edie.

1041
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,810
Edie!

1042
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,210
Get off of me!

1043
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,510
Unh!

1044
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,930
Fuck you, Joey!

1045
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,030
Aah! Get off!

1046
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,070
Uhh!

1047
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,290
Uhh!

1048
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,350
Ohh!

1049
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:51,360
Ohh. Ohh.

1050
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,980
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

1051
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,550
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1052
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,380
Mmm.

1053
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:37,870
Uhh.

1054
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,110
Uhh.

1055
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,010
Uhh.

1056
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:50,350
Hello.

1057
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,890
Hey, Bro-ham.

1058
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,830
You're still pretty good
with the killing.

1059
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,830
That's exciting.

1060
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,200
Richie.

1061
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,930
Yeah, it's Richie.

1062
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,070
What do you say, Joey?

1063
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:06,100
Are you going
to come see me?

1064
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:08,500
Or do I have
to come see you?

1065
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,460
What's that
supposed to mean?

1066
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,760
Uh, Jenny cream.

1067
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,800
Bottle.

1068
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,640
You ruben?

1069
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,790
Yeah.

1070
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,060
You Joey?

1071
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,550
Yeah, I'm Joey.

1072
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,410
So, what do we do now?

1073
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:58,260
You finish your beer,

1074
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:01,130
then I take you to see
Richie in the escalade.

1075
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,990
Nice houses.

1076
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:28,220
Richie's a very upscale
kind of guy.

1077
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,320
Nice gate.

1078
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:48,720
Yeah.

1079
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:22,940
We're here.

1080
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,610
Home, sweet home.

1081
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:58,540
Got to frisk you.

1082
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:00,370
Nah. I'll save you
the trouble.

1083
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,810
I'm not packing.

1084
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:04,960
I got to frisk you.

1085
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,480
All right.

1086
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,320
I don't smell very good.

1087
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:13,420
I've been driving
pretty much non-stop

1088
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,690
15 to 16 hours.

1089
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,990
I'll hold my nose.

1090
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:30,500
Can you believe

1091
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:32,240
that place
is still standing,

1092
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,520
the track and turf?

1093
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:43,260
Didn't you bang
Jill Levy there

1094
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,930
right on the bar
in front of everybody?

1095
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:48,770
I never banged
Jill Levy.

1096
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:55,110
Well, you should've.
She was--she was something.

1097
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:06,450
How you doing,
Richie?

1098
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,890
Mmm.

1099
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,370
Yeah.

1100
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,620
It's been a long,
long time, Bro-ham.

1101
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,280
Yeah.

1102
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,620
Yeah.

1103
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,940
Come with me.

1104
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,660
You want anything?

1105
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,430
Nah.

1106
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,270
So, you like
that farm life?

1107
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:13,180
Milking cows
and shit?

1108
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,330
I don't have a farm.

1109
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:18,250
No?

1110
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:22,520
Fogarty thought you lived
on some kind of farm.

1111
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:27,940
Said you could
smell pig.

1112
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,010
How that old fart
would know

1113
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,580
what a pig smells like,
I don't know,

1114
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,810
but that's what he said.

1115
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,320
Ahem.

1116
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,380
Do you like
being married?

1117
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:43,290
What?

1118
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,590
Do you like
being married?

1119
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:50,110
Does it work for you?

1120
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,760
I can't see it
working for me.

1121
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,060
I never felt the urge,
you know?

1122
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:58,200
A lot of great looking
women in the world.

1123
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,580
I never met one

1124
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:02,420
made me want to give up
all the others.

1125
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,000
Sure, you can
fuck around,

1126
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,440
but it's so much
goddamn work, you know?

1127
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,710
Keeping it quiet.

1128
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,650
It's not worth
the effort.

1129
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,880
Don't see the upside.

1130
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:16,500
You see the upside,
Joey?

1131
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah, Richie, I do.

1132
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:23,410
I do now.

1133
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:29,010
I'm pretty pissed
at you, Bro-ham.

1134
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,480
You could've called.

1135
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:37,550
You could've dropped
a postcard in the mail.

1136
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:40,660
We're brothers. What'd you
think would happen?

1137
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,640
I thought that business
would come first.

1138
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,370
Well, yeah.

1139
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,840
Yeah, I know.

1140
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:05,710
Tch. I know.

1141
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,250
What am I going to do?

1142
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,150
You bust up
a made man's place.

1143
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,340
You killed
some of his guys.

1144
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,840
You take his eye.

1145
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,540
Jesus, Joey,
you took his eye.

1146
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:24,310
Barbed wire,
wasn't it?

1147
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,660
That's disgusting.

1148
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,210
You always were
the crazy one.

1149
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,380
Not anymore.

1150
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,000
Yeah, I heard.

1151
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:32,640
You're living
the American dream.

1152
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,550
You really bought
into it, didn't you?

1153
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,570
You've been
this other guy

1154
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,940
almost as long
as you've been yourself.

1155
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,850
Hey, when you dream,

1156
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:50,380
are you still Joey?

1157
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,800
Joey's been dead
a long time.

1158
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:56,090
And yet here you sit...

1159
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:59,090
Big as life.

1160
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:04,160
You know you cost me

1161
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,630
a lot of time and money.

1162
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,150
Before you pulled
that shit with Fogarty,

1163
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:12,870
I was a shoe-in
to take over

1164
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:16,710
when the boss croaked--
a shoe-in.

1165
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:19,330
It was made very clear
to me, Joey.

1166
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:21,930
I had to clean up
your mess,

1167
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,250
or nothing was ever
going to happen for me.

1168
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:29,220
You got no idea
how much shit I had to pull

1169
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:32,440
to get back in
with those guys.

1170
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,940
You cost me...

1171
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:43,380
A hell of a lot, Joey,
a hell of a lot.

1172
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,970
Looks like you're doing
all right over here.

1173
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:51,520
Yeah, I am, I am.

1174
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:55,930
I'm still behind
the eightball...

1175
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,810
Because of you.

1176
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:59,850
There's a certain
lack of respect,

1177
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,650
a certain lack of trust.

1178
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:06,440
The boys in Boston

1179
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,970
are just waiting
for me to go down.

1180
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,680
You always were
a problem for me, Joey.

1181
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,050
When mom brought you home
from the hospital,

1182
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,850
I tried to strangle you
in your crib.

1183
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,250
I guess all kids
try to do that.

1184
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,260
She caught me,

1185
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,730
whacked the daylights
out of me.

1186
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:34,530
I've heard that story.

1187
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,320
Well, what do you think?

1188
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,860
Better late than never?

1189
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,690
Richie...

1190
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:53,460
I'm here to make peace.

1191
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:57,330
Tell me what I got to do
to make things right.

1192
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:01,750
You could do something,
I guess.

1193
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,630
You could die, Joey.

1194
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,010
Ooh!

1195
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,120
Uhh!

1196
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,270
Uhh!

1197
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,000
Unh!
Oh!

1198
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:41,090
Oh!

1199
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:43,340
Uhh!

1200
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,560
Uhh! Ohh!

1201
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,630
How do you fuck that up?

1202
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,600
Uhh!

1203
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:13,680
How do you fuck that up?

1204
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,990
What are you going to do,
give him mouth-to-mouth?

1205
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:36,760
Did you see my brother?

1206
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:37,970
Fuckin' leave this

1207
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,660
and let's just kill
that little fuck!

1208
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:45,950
Jesus, Joey.

1209
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:11,190
Jesus, Richie.
