1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,918
Pelle the Conqueror

2
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,993
- Papa...
- I'm sleeping.

3
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,402
Tell me about it again, papa.

4
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,568
It's very different this new country.

5
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:57,615
- You'll hardly...
- You'll hardly believe your eyes.

6
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,017
They put raisins in the pork roast
and butter on your bread ...

7
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,886
Some places
they put butter on your bread.

8
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:10,485
The brandy... is cheap as water...

9
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,925
... and strong enough
to knock you off your feet.

10
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,629
But your father can handle it, Pelle,
because he's strong.

11
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,468
- And kids are free all day.
- Yes, Pelle, yes.

12
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,334
Tell me about it again.

13
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,638
Wages are so incredibly high,
that kids...

14
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,046
That kids don't have to work.

15
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,881
- They can ... play all day.
- Yes.

16
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,961
They won't fool me. Shouldn't take
the first offer that comes along.

17
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,212
This is my boy.

18
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,315
No, widower.
We're from Tommelilla.

19
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,604
My name is Lasse Karlsson
I'm looking for work.

20
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,048
That one looks like
he'd be kind to children.

21
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,464
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm looking for work.

22
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,795
Go back to Sweden, you old devil.

23
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,845
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm looking for...

24
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,413
No... shouldn't take
the first offer that comes along.

25
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,191
I'm Lasse Karlsson from
Tommelilla. I'm looking ...

26
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:06,097
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm looking for work.

27
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,224
You're too old,
and the boy is too young.

28
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,741
Shouldn't take the first offer
that comes along.

29
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,335
No...

30
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,874
You're too late.

31
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,483
I suppose you're looking for work.

32
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,885
Where are your parents?

33
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,679
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm looking for...

34
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,450
Let me see your papers.

35
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,433
I'll hire you for 100 crowns a year...

36
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,202
... including the boy.

37
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,408
Good Lord ...

38
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,677
You'll be staying in there.

39
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,886
If you have any questions
ask me or the trainee.

40
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:26,753
Come back here,
you stupid animals!

41
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,792
Come back here,
you miserable creatures.

42
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,528
Come on.

43
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,168
Move it. Come on.

44
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,875
H it them on their teats. Or their
hind legs, then they'll listen.

45
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,547
Just hit them.

46
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,289
Get back I said.

47
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,371
If you help me with the cows
and teach me Danish ...

48
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,412
... we can share my food.

49
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:27,315
Always keep a stone in your pocket.
If one runs away...

50
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,220
... hit her with it and call her name.

51
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,120
She'll come back
then she'll know who's boss.

52
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,660
- What's your name?
- Rud.

53
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,391
- Rut?
- Rud. Stick your tongue out.

54
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,537
If you stick your head between your
legs and the sun is above the trees...

55
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,573
... it's time to give them water.

56
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,912
You can also hear it
by the larks' song.

57
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,243
That's my mother.
She can't say Rud either.

58
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,050
Here's my food.

59
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,835
Stablehand, why is that
cow standing there?

60
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,777
Why is Gabriella standing there?

61
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,143
Why is Gabriella standing there?

62
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,252
The girls can't find their cows
when you move them around.

63
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,559
Aspasia it says.

64
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,573
Perhaps Mr. trainee could tell me
where she is suppose to stand.

65
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,278
Kongstrup is back!

66
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:26,001
Erik, why haven't you unharnassed
Kongstrup's horses?

67
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,604
Because I am going to
eat my food first.

68
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,711
Oh, really?

69
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,914
You're not gonna leave these
horses there, while you eat.

70
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,678
Get out... you lazy dog.

71
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,266
Don't you know its forbidden
to steal the milk?

72
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,067
You should be whipped for that!

73
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,568
Well, never mind this time.

74
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,249
Hey, Pelle ...

75
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,481
I've been thinking.

76
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,994
You and your father want to get rich?

77
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:01,357
I know where you can find
lots of gold coins.

78
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,561
If you can keep a secret.

79
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,208
Come in here, Pelle,
very quietly.

80
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,582
The raven can be dangerous
if it hears us.

81
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,250
Come.

82
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,969
Mr. trainee!

83
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,214
Mr. trainee, sir!

84
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,623
Jump, you stinking Swede!

85
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,935
You dirty bastard!

86
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,838
Do you want to taste
the whip yourself?

87
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,609
Stop it or I'll turn you both in
to the authorities.

88
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,595
Get out and don't show your face
for a good while.

89
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,129
You son-of-a-bitch!

90
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,048
He'll be punished. You can be sure.

91
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,061
- On my word of honor... I'll ...
- Kill him.

92
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,495
- That dirty bastard ...
- Promise you'll kill him?

93
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,469
- You can count on it, Pelle.
- How?

94
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,598
- How?
- How are you going to kill him?

95
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,580
With a hammer, I think...

96
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,876
You'll kill him stone dead ...
Like a dead dog?

97
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,183
You bet...

98
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,587
But who'll read
the cows' names then?

99
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,126
You're right...

100
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,094
Yes... We'd better
make it just a whipping.

101
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,099
Then he can still read for us.

102
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,041
But it will be a proper whipping.

103
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:52,687
Yarn for the boy's grey socks.
The patch was for...

104
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,829
The Sunday sweater, said Bengta.

105
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,869
The sleeves should be let down.

106
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:08,176
Your mother was so worried. She
didn't think I could take care of you.

107
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,013
Count on me, Bengta.

108
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:17,052
Don't wear the socks too long,
she said. Don't wear them through.

109
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,247
Lasse!

110
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,250
Lasse?

111
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,700
Lasse?

112
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,228
It's the trainee.

113
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,572
Lasse, where the hell are you,
you Swedish bumpkin?

114
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,543
Will you kill him now, papa?

115
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,383
Yes, yes...

116
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,869
Mr. trainee ...
I want to protest against...

117
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,304
Mr. trainee ... As a father
I want to protest against...

118
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,067
Why don't you answer when I call?

119
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,837
Ex cuse me.

120
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,644
I just want to protest about
the way Pelle was...

121
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,346
Are you deaf? Watch out
I don't report you to the manager.

122
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,629
Aspasia is not going
out to pasture tomorrow.

123
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,264
- Is she going to calve?
- Did you think she was foaling?

124
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,920
You can lie there and cry, but if
one can't read Aspasia's name ...

125
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,998
... one ought to show a little respect.

126
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,092
I know where Aspasia's stall is.
She's the third one from the door.

127
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:17,138
- You promised, papa!
- Speak Swedish with your father!

128
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,105
You do speak Swedish, don't you?

129
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,013
Are you so proud you won't speak
your mother- tongue anymore?

130
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,686
Lasse is old and poor...

131
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:36,094
No respect... They can do
what they want with you.

132
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,830
What good does it do
to make a fist...

133
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,059
... when there's no strength left?

134
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,972
I'm getting older...
But you're young, Pelle ...

135
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,798
You can conquer the whole world.

136
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,909
I nearly forgot... Look here.

137
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,983
Look, Pelle ...
Look what I have ...

138
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,876
Look at this, Pelle.

139
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,479
I brought it with me from Sweden.

140
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,294
From Tommelilla.

141
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,395
If we're lucky,
we'll get wild strawberries.

142
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,809
Just think, Pelle ...
Real Swedish strawberries.

143
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,353
N ils, get your father some water.

144
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,011
N ils, how about that water?

145
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,254
Watch out!

146
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,130
What the hell are you doing son?

147
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,021
Where have you been?

148
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,387
The Missus sent me to the store.

149
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,277
What's that you're hiding
under your jacket, Pelle?

150
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,751
The Missus said
I wasn't to show it to anyone.

151
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,585
You're a clever boy, Pelle.

152
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:40,063
If you give me the bag,
I'll give it to the Missus...

153
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,001
... so no one sees it.

154
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,585
Cognac...

155
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,559
Give it to me.

156
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:20,707
I won't move. The boy should
know that you take my things.

157
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,410
Don't do it!

158
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:31,387
Give me that bottle, Kongstrup!
You lousy bastard!

159
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,287
Pelle, go down and tell them
how he bullies me.

160
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,488
- Tell them how he's ruining my life.
- That's enough!

161
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,442
Keep it.

162
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,499
God who keeps his children near,
look at me who's kneeling here.

163
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:27,344
My happiness is in God's hands,
whatever are the world's demands.

164
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,277
- Happiness comes, happiness...
- Papa?

165
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,147
Tomorrow you can say
the day after tomorrow.

166
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,750
And the day after tomorrow,
you can say tomorrow.

167
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,993
- My birthday.
- Oh, yes...

168
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,326
Pelle, the cognac he poured out...

169
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,996
... was it real cognac?

170
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,772
lnto the flower pot?

171
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,348
Happiness comes, happiness goes.

172
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,547
You better get dressed.

173
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,953
Trousers, Pelle.
Trousers first.

174
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:56,559
But what's in your pocket?

175
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,034
You haven't been stealing
eggs last night, have you?

176
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,138
Let's see.

177
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,110
Oh, it's only paper.

178
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,782
Why do you stuff your pockets?

179
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,946
Happy birthday
and God bless you, son.

180
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:52,990
Thank you.

181
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,563
It's just a poor man's gift, Pelle.

182
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,492
Look.

183
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,467
Now that's really something!

184
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,867
It's a birthday present.

185
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:50,076
I should have guessed. You look like
someone who's got a birthday.

186
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,980
Happy birthday.

187
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,963
They say...

188
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,300
Are you really
going to run away to America?

189
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,539
Run away...
Run away, Pelle.

190
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,069
Do I look like an idiot?

191
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:23,104
You think I'd risk losing
all my savings and be lawless?

192
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,582
I want to be free, Pelle.

193
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,542
A free man.

194
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,553
That's what I'm waiting for.

195
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,583
A free man.

196
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,617
Come and see.

197
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,710
Look here, Pelle.

198
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,150
This...

199
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,488
This is the boat to America.

200
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,964
I've got two years left
to work on this damn farm.

201
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,271
Then I'll have enough
money for the ticket.

202
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:25,773
As soon as the manager pays me,
I'll go out and conquer the world.

203
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,744
Across the ocean.

204
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:34,548
First to America, then to
China, Spain, Negroland.

205
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,387
The whole damn world, Pelle.

206
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:43,519
It's there, waiting for you, Pelle.
It's almost too easy.

207
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,289
- lmagine ...
- I'm coming with you.

208
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,567
Yes.

209
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,470
Since it's your birthday,
I'll let you come along.

210
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,368
Remember, in two years, as soon
as the snow begins to melt...

211
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,536
... we'll go out and conquer it.

212
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,043
That great, awful ...

213
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,314
... wonderful world.

214
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,061
Now.

215
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,155
There you are.

216
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,735
We've always eaten wild
strawberries on your birthday.

217
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,138
Think... real Swedish strawberries.

218
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,572
How far is America, papa?

219
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,674
America?

220
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:19,021
Very far. There's a big
mighty ocean between us.

221
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,218
Erik says the sea is
the strongest there is.

222
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,561
It's soft and yet
it can hold anything up.

223
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,258
lron or rock.

224
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:40,074
I wonder if the countries America
and China are attached ...

225
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:46,978
...to the ocean bottom
or do they drift freely about?

226
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,888
Then they would be hard to find.

227
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,052
They're firmly fix ed to
the ocean bottom, I imagine.

228
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,133
Kongstrup!

229
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,012
Come out, Kongstrup.
I want to talk to you!

230
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:02,613
- Your lad is hungry!
- The sow and the cabbagehead ...

231
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,381
Kongstrup, your bastard son
needs money for food!

232
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,027
Where are you going, you
cabbagehead? Stay here.

233
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,429
Come out and say hello to your
bastard son. He's hungry.

234
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,367
That lecher, he has kids
all over the place.

235
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,597
Ex cept with his missus.

236
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,341
They say she is a witch.

237
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:30,878
- The monthly allowance f or your son.
- Didn't I tell you not to come here?

238
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,813
The lad's allowed to see his father.

239
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:39,819
- Get out, you disgusting sow.
- Kongstrup has to pay his due.

240
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,859
Kongstrup!
You'll never get rid of your son.

241
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,197
You'll never get rid of us!

242
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:07,982
Kongstrup!

243
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,281
Kongstrup!

244
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,744
Take good care of
your slate now, Pelle.

245
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:44,649
And stay out of the way of the big
boys, until you can handle them.

246
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:49,726
But if they won't leave you alone,
you hit first and run hard.

247
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,294
They'll leave you alone
if you hit hard enough.

248
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:58,198
Listen to everything the teacher says
and don't make trouble.

249
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,031
Remember to use your handkerchief.

250
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,764
Do not use your fingers.

251
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:10,643
But if no one's looking, then you
can save the handkerchief.

252
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,750
Take care of your sweater,
now that I've mended it.

253
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:20,255
If the teacher's wife invites you to
coffee, take only one piece cake.

254
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,924
- But she won't.
- Why not?

255
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,860
- He never got married.
- I see.

256
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,259
Run along now.

257
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:37,035
B-A is ba.
B- E is be.

258
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:42,601
B-A is ba.

259
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:47,147
B- E is be.

260
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:51,084
B- I is bi.

261
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,349
B-O is bo.

262
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,825
B- U is bu.

263
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,654
B-Y is by.

264
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:06,268
B-A is bahh!

265
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,771
You miserable brats.
Will you be quiet?!

266
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,272
Quiet, you rascals!

267
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,346
Quiet! Quiet!

268
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,184
You rascals!

269
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,588
Let us welcome the new pupil.

270
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,063
Stand up.

271
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:47,169
- Tell us your name.
- Pelle Karlsson.

272
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,841
And what can you do?

273
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,680
I can hit a cow with a stone
from a hundred paces.

274
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,987
And I can make my cows stand still
by buzzing like a wasp.

275
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,958
- And I can make Bismarck...
- Can you read?

276
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,289
No, otherwise I wouldn't be here.

277
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,462
Leave your impudent
remarks at home.

278
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:28,214
What's this one, Pelle?
Don't think I've ever seen that one.

279
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,650
Have you already forgotten?
I remembered after seeing it once.

280
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:40,224
- It's an F.
- Of course. That's what it is.

281
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:45,028
What's wrong with my head today?
An F that's it.

282
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,399
What do you think it's used for?

283
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,140
It's the first letter in F-ternoon.

284
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:57,939
Of course. But you didn't
figure that out alone.

285
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:02,075
- The teacher must have told you.
- No, I figured it out myself.

286
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,647
You did?
You're getting clever, Pelle.

287
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:11,221
There's no end to what a lad with
so much book learning can do.

288
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:41,815
Maybe we'll get roast pork
with raisins, Pelle.

289
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:48,150
Or with apples. Some places
they make it with apples instead.

290
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,392
We'll see.

291
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,763
Get out! I don't want
any more trouble with you.

292
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:05,841
- Get out!
- Oh, hell, herring on Christmas Eve.

293
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:11,039
If you don't like the food,
then find some other place.

294
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,150
Herring, herring ...
Herring every single day!

295
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:17,253
Couldn't we have had
roast pork for Christmas?

296
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,154
Damn you, always complaining.
Go back to Sweden ...

297
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,156
... if you don't like it here.

298
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:28,287
Are you so damn stingy? Don't
you think we work hard enough?

299
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:32,528
And you, of all people, say that.
Go to your room.

300
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,628
Damned!

301
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,672
Damned!

302
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,641
Damn the Stone Farm.

303
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,755
Does anyone else
have any complaints?

304
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,315
Scram, you oaf!

305
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,118
What are you doing here?
Go back to the other oafs.

306
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,988
Watch out, Pelle. The water's wet.

307
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,596
You could get wet, you yellow-belly.

308
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:11,253
Get lost, Pelle! You could
get dizzy and fall in the water.

309
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,287
Go home, Pelle!

310
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:23,522
- Go back to the other oafs.
- Get lost, yellow-belly!

311
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,906
Go home, yellow-belly!

312
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:35,569
I'm no more that than you! You
don't even dare jump in the water.

313
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,920
You must be crazy,
jumping into the water...

314
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,148
... like some love-sick woman.

315
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,953
A good beating is what you need.

316
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:05,795
If you had drowned I'd have given
you such a beating, believe me.

317
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,463
To think I should be the father
of such a half-witted idiot.

318
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:16,669
Do you think, doctor,
he'd be better if you bled him?

319
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,726
Here you are.

320
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,396
This will help your cold.

321
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,443
Don't be afraid, Pelle.
I'm not a witch.

322
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:52,880
Just very unhappy sometimes.

323
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,482
Oh, dear Lord ...

324
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:03,489
...you don't even have a mother,
poor thing.

325
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,121
It's three years since
Mama Bengta died.

326
00:50:32,582 --> 00:50:33,879
Here you are.

327
00:50:34,684 --> 00:50:36,549
This will help your cold.

328
00:50:43,193 --> 00:50:47,596
Don't be afraid, Pelle.
I'm not a witch.

329
00:50:49,165 --> 00:50:53,033
Just very unhappy sometimes.

330
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:57,635
Oh, dear Lord ...

331
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:03,642
...you don't even have a mother,
poor thing.

332
00:51:04,714 --> 00:51:07,274
It's three years since
Mama Bengta died.

333
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:11,677
She's lying in the left-hand corner
of the cemetery now.

334
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:14,878
Do you miss her much?

335
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,022
Lasse mends my clothes.

336
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:23,654
She was a good mother
to you, wasn't she?

337
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:28,727
She was so ill and grouchy
at the end.

338
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:31,328
It was better that she died.

339
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:37,968
But we'll marry again soon.

340
00:51:39,712 --> 00:51:41,543
And then you'll leave.

341
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,249
You don't like it here anyway,
do you?

342
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:51,347
Nobody likes it at Stone Farm.

343
00:51:52,157 --> 00:51:54,352
Everything turns bad here.

344
00:51:55,394 --> 00:51:57,521
It must be an old curse.

345
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,395
Is that what they say?

346
00:52:01,433 --> 00:52:02,491
Well, well ...

347
00:52:05,337 --> 00:52:07,305
And what do they say about me?

348
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:11,405
That Missus has a pact
with the devil ...

349
00:52:11,543 --> 00:52:14,068
... and turns into a werewolf at night.

350
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:22,483
And just because
I love only one man.

351
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:30,160
Why does he do this to me?

352
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:33,891
He's gone into town again,
the lecher.

353
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:38,128
I married him,
made him a proprietor...

354
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:42,773
... gave him my love.
The best I have, I've given him.

355
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,572
If only he could have
given me a child.

356
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:50,909
- I think I'd better go down to papa.
- Now you're afraid of me again.

357
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:55,843
You're a good boy, Pelle.

358
00:52:57,723 --> 00:53:02,854
If I had a son, I would
want him to be like you.

359
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:26,437
Papa, there's the Missus
with her young family.

360
00:54:29,882 --> 00:54:32,282
Pelle, you step forward.

361
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,553
Hello, Pelle. Where's your father?

362
00:54:45,264 --> 00:54:49,166
This is our stablehand, Lasse
Karlsson and his son Pelle.

363
00:54:49,301 --> 00:54:50,268
Hello.

364
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:58,074
This is my niece from Copenhagen.

365
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,077
Miss Signe is going to stay with us.

366
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:38,073
I've forgotten what 2 x 2 is.

367
00:55:40,252 --> 00:55:43,221
Even if my knowledge
is somewhat rusty...

368
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:45,653
... I'll see if I can help you.

369
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:48,756
2 x 2 is 5.

370
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,563
Which is lighter, a pound of
feathers or a pound of lead?

371
00:55:58,704 --> 00:56:00,729
Not you, Pelle.

372
00:56:02,574 --> 00:56:06,670
Perhaps Pelle would be so kind
as to repeat his question.

373
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,339
If a pound of flour costs 12 øre, what
does a barrel of gunpowder cost?

374
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:16,672
Where the hell's the herring?
That's all I ever eat.

375
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:19,546
Herring, herring, herring!

376
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:23,413
Do you know the difference
between you and a buttock?

377
00:57:24,756 --> 00:57:27,020
I don't know either.

378
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,318
Erik, did you hear what I asked?

379
00:57:33,165 --> 00:57:37,033
Lasse, can you take my place
at the chaff-cutter tonight?

380
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:38,864
But it's Saturday.

381
00:57:40,172 --> 00:57:42,140
I'm going out to have some fun.

382
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:45,777
You're not getting off so easy.

383
00:57:52,484 --> 00:57:55,078
He's got a way with women,
like his papa.

384
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,018
It must be a hell of a long time
since Lasse Karlsson ...

385
00:57:58,156 --> 00:58:02,286
Karna, I've been thinking lately...

386
00:58:02,427 --> 00:58:08,024
You've been good to Pelle,
and you like the boy.

387
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:13,034
Why not move in together. We could
have a good life, the two of us.

388
00:58:13,505 --> 00:58:15,370
You're too old, Lasse.

389
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:19,876
My man has to be dangerous.
You're not dangerous anymore.

390
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:21,539
I see.

391
00:58:24,716 --> 00:58:27,207
So you're out fishing for young men.

392
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:31,245
Watch out you don't miss the boat.

393
00:58:31,923 --> 00:58:35,256
Lasse, run down to the store
and get us some brandy.

394
00:58:35,827 --> 00:58:38,762
Come on, damn it. It's Saturday.

395
00:58:38,897 --> 00:58:43,129
You can get your own brandy.
Just because someone is old ...

396
00:58:44,102 --> 00:58:47,196
In the old days there was respect.
They always said ...

397
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:50,069
... "Where's Lasse?
Get Lasse Karlsson."

398
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:54,108
The girls were chasing you,
even if you were married.

399
00:58:54,246 --> 00:58:55,645
There was respect.

400
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:04,348
Papa!

401
00:59:10,362 --> 00:59:13,160
I had hoped when we came here ...

402
00:59:13,298 --> 00:59:18,759
...that there would be some
money left to buy a little house ...

403
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:23,574
... and maybe find a woman,
who could take care of us.

404
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:29,976
Then we could have coffee in bed
Sunday mornings, eh Pelle?

405
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:34,074
We could run away together, papa.

406
00:59:34,386 --> 00:59:35,648
Run away...

407
00:59:36,354 --> 00:59:40,188
But think of the authorities.
I don't want to become an outlaw.

408
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:43,294
I mean far away, to America.

409
00:59:43,595 --> 00:59:46,826
We could go to America and
get us a house and a wife.

410
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:49,694
We could save up
all our money, papa.

411
00:59:53,171 --> 00:59:54,433
We have to get away.

412
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:22,427
What are you doing here?

413
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:33,375
- Stealing eggs. I was so hungry.
- Don't tell anyone you saw me.

414
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:41,878
I know who the father is.

415
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:02,968
You mustn't tell anyone.

416
01:01:05,744 --> 01:01:10,681
H is father would ...
If he knew, he would ...

417
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:14,375
I'm not good enough for them.

418
01:01:15,353 --> 01:01:17,878
I don't know what to do.

419
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,285
Promise not to tell.

420
01:01:24,629 --> 01:01:25,857
Never.

421
01:01:39,311 --> 01:01:40,369
Pelle!

422
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:43,906
Come here!

423
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:50,950
- What were you doing there?
- Stealing eggs.

424
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,348
Bend over.

425
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:43,504
Can I have your half-crown?

426
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:46,473
Have my half-crown?
Are you crazy?

427
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:49,745
I'll need it when I go to America.

428
01:02:50,882 --> 01:02:53,442
When I'm bigger
I'll give you back ten.

429
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:57,112
You'll never get big.
You're deformed.

430
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:03,019
I'll go on show ... at tivolis.

431
01:03:04,462 --> 01:03:05,690
At tivolis?

432
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:08,594
As a monster. I'll get filthy rich.

433
01:03:15,473 --> 01:03:16,599
But Pelle ...

434
01:03:19,444 --> 01:03:22,971
... give it to me and you can
beat me 100 times with nettles.

435
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:25,505
On your bare skin?

436
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:27,677
A hundred times.

437
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:31,344
- You can't take that.
- As hard as you want.

438
01:03:41,132 --> 01:03:43,293
A hundred blows. Are you ready?

439
01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:04,318
That's enough.

440
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:08,926
Then you don't get the money.

441
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:11,390
You hit too hard.

442
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:16,290
- You want it or not?
- The money first, then.

443
01:05:15,427 --> 01:05:19,124
Can't you tell us anything about
Adam and Eve and the serpent?

444
01:05:21,332 --> 01:05:22,299
Well?

445
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:24,892
We're waiting.

446
01:05:27,138 --> 01:05:30,471
Have you ever heard of
Adam and Eve and the serpent?

447
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:36,774
Haven't you been listening in class?

448
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:43,644
What did the serpent promise them
if they ate from the apple?

449
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,594
Don't think I feel sorry for you.

450
01:05:52,864 --> 01:05:58,894
It promised that if they could
distinguish between good and evil.

451
01:06:00,004 --> 01:06:02,768
How can we let you
continue in this class...

452
01:06:02,907 --> 01:06:06,206
... if you don't understand
the most elementary things?

453
01:06:07,145 --> 01:06:08,976
Are his parents here?

454
01:06:15,787 --> 01:06:19,917
They are not even here.
All right, sit down.

455
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:23,524
Ne xt... Pelle.

456
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:36,507
Perhaps you can tell us
what God said to the serpent?

457
01:06:36,975 --> 01:06:40,467
And God said to the serpent,
You shall ...

458
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:47,039
You shall crawl on your belly...

459
01:06:48,686 --> 01:06:52,122
You shall crawl on your belly...

460
01:06:55,026 --> 01:06:59,122
- And does it still do so?
- Yes, because it has no limbs.

461
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:01,965
And can you tell me what a limb is?

462
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,591
A limb is...

463
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:09,967
- A hand, for e xample.
- Yes.

464
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:14,607
What distinguishes all limbs
from other parts of the body?

465
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:21,808
A limb is...

466
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:27,018
A limb moves independently.
An e xample?

467
01:07:37,368 --> 01:07:38,335
Ears.

468
01:07:39,337 --> 01:07:43,273
- Can you move the ears?
- Yes.

469
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:45,975
I should really like to see that.

470
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:06,956
So your ears saved you.
I always told you to use your ears.

471
01:08:18,443 --> 01:08:19,410
Rud!

472
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:30,019
Rud, you idiot. Come back!

473
01:08:32,857 --> 01:08:38,295
If you run away you'll never get
to your grandma in heaven.

474
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:47,069
You can have my knife
if you come back.

475
01:08:55,913 --> 01:08:57,938
You can't do that to me.

476
01:10:48,559 --> 01:10:49,821
What are you doing?

477
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:55,955
Don't remove those stones.
The child is buried there.

478
01:10:57,835 --> 01:11:02,363
Yes it is... Anna killed your child
and she was sent to jail.

479
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:09,279
I did it...

480
01:11:11,582 --> 01:11:13,550
I killed the child.

481
01:11:17,889 --> 01:11:20,255
Papa could never kill me.

482
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:30,293
Why can't you leave me alone?

483
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:36,130
It's my meadow, and you mustn't
take the stones away from the child.

484
01:11:37,608 --> 01:11:41,169
You mustn't say that.
You mustn't lie before God.

485
01:11:41,712 --> 01:11:44,510
The child is in the cemetery,
in consecrated earth.

486
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:46,082
The child is buried here.

487
01:11:46,217 --> 01:11:49,118
I've seen his soul burning
on the rocks at night.

488
01:11:49,253 --> 01:11:52,313
That's because God won't
let him come up to Heaven.

489
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,092
N ils!

490
01:13:01,259 --> 01:13:04,228
Who has gone out there
into the arms of death?

491
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:08,392
It's N ils.
He went out with the line.

492
01:15:26,637 --> 01:15:29,629
Your eyes are young.
Can you see N ils?

493
01:16:22,126 --> 01:16:23,821
He was a good boy.

494
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:27,322
He was my everything.

495
01:16:28,132 --> 01:16:31,431
My light... my warmth.

496
01:16:33,537 --> 01:16:37,166
He never spoke an evil word.

497
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:40,610
Even though I denied him his love.

498
01:16:42,847 --> 01:16:45,372
Now I'm without a son.

499
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,184
Without a child.

500
01:17:00,197 --> 01:17:06,102
May he find peace now.
He had so little of it here on earth.

501
01:17:09,073 --> 01:17:11,803
He rescued the lives of five men.

502
01:17:12,777 --> 01:17:17,544
Maybe now
Our Lord will receive him.

503
01:17:32,763 --> 01:17:35,323
Come on, Erik.
Come on!

504
01:17:36,233 --> 01:17:39,259
Two more inches and you've won
yourself a bottle of brandy.

505
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,808
When will you drink it?
The Manager says you have to work.

506
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:57,715
He can work if he wants,
the bloody Stone Farm manager.

507
01:17:57,855 --> 01:18:01,814
No one is going to keep Erik in,
when he's free and wants some fun.

508
01:18:02,526 --> 01:18:04,016
Can I come with you?

509
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:06,825
Not now, Pelle.

510
01:18:08,365 --> 01:18:12,426
Not now ...
Remember in one year...

511
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:17,769
When the snow melts, then we'll
go out into the real world.

512
01:18:18,209 --> 01:18:23,579
First to America and then
to Negroland and China.

513
01:18:25,182 --> 01:18:27,548
The whole damn world, Pelle.

514
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:48,897
Where are you going?
You scoundrel! Erik!

515
01:18:52,576 --> 01:18:53,736
What's this?

516
01:18:53,911 --> 01:18:55,469
Are you ill?

517
01:18:55,613 --> 01:18:59,572
I must have caught a cold.
My whole body is shivering.

518
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:03,015
It couldn't be mumps, could it?
Let's look at you, boy.

519
01:19:03,153 --> 01:19:06,054
Look at you, lying there
in your Sunday clothes.

520
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:07,953
What's this, your funeral dress?

521
01:19:08,592 --> 01:19:11,493
Were you going out to buy
yourself a burial place, huh?

522
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:16,692
It's about time we get you into the
ground. You're beginning to smell.

523
01:19:17,534 --> 01:19:19,434
I'm not dead yet...

524
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:24,370
And I don't smell more
than some people.

525
01:19:27,177 --> 01:19:30,169
Always trouble with you.
Never satisfied with the food.

526
01:19:30,314 --> 01:19:33,283
- Always complaining about work.
- Why don't you hit me?

527
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:34,509
Go on, hit me!

528
01:19:39,924 --> 01:19:42,518
There must be authorities
in this country.

529
01:19:45,195 --> 01:19:47,186
Now you do your job...

530
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:50,258
... or I'll show you the authorities.

531
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:36,246
The manager wants you to be quiet.

532
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:43,681
What are you saying,
you little chicken?

533
01:20:45,422 --> 01:20:49,119
- The manager wants you ...
- I can't hear you.

534
01:20:50,728 --> 01:20:53,219
The manager wants you to be quiet.

535
01:20:54,531 --> 01:20:58,797
Listen to him.
Listen to that stupid boy.

536
01:20:59,069 --> 01:21:01,435
He is still wet behind the ears.

537
01:21:05,476 --> 01:21:08,934
Run back and tell him
to run his own errands.

538
01:21:10,447 --> 01:21:11,505
Skol!

539
01:21:19,056 --> 01:21:21,217
Skol, you devil!

540
01:21:27,231 --> 01:21:28,892
Good Lord ...

541
01:21:30,267 --> 01:21:32,201
I'm not dead yet.

542
01:22:55,986 --> 01:22:58,580
- Where are you going, Erik?
- To rest.

543
01:22:58,822 --> 01:23:01,689
- What?
- To rest.

544
01:23:02,826 --> 01:23:06,557
No. You have to do your job.

545
01:23:06,897 --> 01:23:11,163
- I'm allowed to rest.
- Who says so?

546
01:23:11,535 --> 01:23:15,528
- Like the others.
- That's for me to decide.

547
01:23:15,672 --> 01:23:18,004
Get back to work, Erik.

548
01:23:19,143 --> 01:23:23,512
- I always have to work.
- What a pity.

549
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:27,375
That's because you're so clever...

550
01:23:27,518 --> 01:23:32,683
... and yell such loving words at me
when I turn my back.

551
01:23:37,628 --> 01:23:40,756
What the hell do you think
you get your money for?

552
01:23:41,098 --> 01:23:45,762
Are you so goddamn stupid?
You have to work for your wages.

553
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,998
Get back to work...

554
01:23:49,273 --> 01:23:52,037
...you lousy bastard.

555
01:23:57,714 --> 01:24:01,912
I'll have to go to the authorities
and report you ...

556
01:24:02,052 --> 01:24:04,145
... and keep your wages.

557
01:24:04,288 --> 01:24:08,554
All your wages, Erik.
Fine.

558
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:17,258
Papa! Lasse!
They're coming.

559
01:25:38,582 --> 01:25:42,143
Good Lord ...
They're going to do it.

560
01:27:02,632 --> 01:27:04,497
Carry him down to the cellar.

561
01:27:15,178 --> 01:27:17,373
Carry him down to the cellar!

562
01:27:29,292 --> 01:27:31,487
The rest of you go back to work.

563
01:28:41,665 --> 01:28:43,690
Come inside and get warm.

564
01:28:43,834 --> 01:28:46,132
I just wanted to get out of the wind.

565
01:28:54,344 --> 01:28:59,839
The mama Bengta died and now
she's in the cemetery back home.

566
01:29:00,851 --> 01:29:02,978
And your father is a widower?

567
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:09,618
I think that's what it's called.

568
01:29:12,062 --> 01:29:16,021
The sea is hard. My husband's
been out there for a year now.

569
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:18,293
I've been a widow since.

570
01:29:21,972 --> 01:29:23,564
Has he drowned?

571
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:29,406
No, he hasn't.
I haven't had an omen yet.

572
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:44,319
How long did you say
her husband has been at sea?

573
01:29:44,961 --> 01:29:46,451
A year, I think.

574
01:29:48,164 --> 01:29:50,632
So she's been alone a whole year.

575
01:29:52,102 --> 01:29:53,592
That's a long time.

576
01:29:58,942 --> 01:30:01,672
And you told her that
mama Bengta was dead?

577
01:30:02,612 --> 01:30:04,443
Yes, of course you did.

578
01:30:20,664 --> 01:30:24,122
This is all we have left
of mama's things.

579
01:30:27,404 --> 01:30:29,668
It's all or nothing now, Pelle.

580
01:30:31,308 --> 01:30:35,176
You go by Madame Olsen's place
after school tomorrow ...

581
01:30:35,312 --> 01:30:36,677
... and give her this.

582
01:30:38,548 --> 01:30:41,915
As a thank you for her kindness
to you in the storm.

583
01:30:49,693 --> 01:30:51,684
Would you believe it, Pelle ...

584
01:30:52,395 --> 01:30:55,626
... I got an omen last night
in that awful storm.

585
01:30:55,999 --> 01:30:59,628
I dreamt that a big black dog
stood at my bed.

586
01:31:01,438 --> 01:31:03,531
H is coat was dripping wet...

587
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,535
... and I understood it had to be
the shipdog with a message.

588
01:31:07,677 --> 01:31:09,304
I got out of bed ...

589
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:13,174
... and outside my window
I saw a ship go down.

590
01:31:15,185 --> 01:31:17,449
The heavens and the sea met.

591
01:31:19,422 --> 01:31:22,186
I saw my husband rise to heaven.

592
01:31:23,793 --> 01:31:25,988
He was completely transparent.

593
01:31:26,696 --> 01:31:29,631
Saltwater dripped off him.

594
01:32:03,466 --> 01:32:07,698
- Who's there?
- Pelle's father, Lasse Karlsson.

595
01:32:39,335 --> 01:32:40,859
So that's Pelle's father.

596
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,699
It's quite a young son you have.

597
01:32:47,911 --> 01:32:49,845
Come in and sit down.

598
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,354
He was a late-comer you might say.

599
01:33:05,762 --> 01:33:10,222
But I can still do a man's work,
both here and there.

600
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:13,625
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

601
01:33:24,881 --> 01:33:27,679
I really ought to be going.

602
01:33:27,984 --> 01:33:29,178
Eat.

603
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,154
Go ahead, eat.
That's how you know a man.

604
01:33:36,126 --> 01:33:37,821
You've walked a long way.

605
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:41,294
I just wanted to thank you
for being so kind to the boy.

606
01:33:41,431 --> 01:33:45,367
Nonsense. Here ... eat.

607
01:33:49,072 --> 01:33:55,102
- You must have been a good wife.
- That's true enough.

608
01:33:55,945 --> 01:33:59,472
He got everything that was
his due when he was ashore.

609
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:03,610
But he was ungrateful,
and one gets tired.

610
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:09,016
I don't think mama Bengta
would have said that about me.

611
01:34:09,325 --> 01:34:13,455
There's plenty to do in this house,
if there's a man to help.

612
01:34:15,799 --> 01:34:17,562
I only have one cow ...

613
01:34:18,768 --> 01:34:20,929
... but one could have two.

614
01:34:23,006 --> 01:34:26,635
I'm only a poor devil
compared to you ...

615
01:34:28,278 --> 01:34:31,247
... but we have decent clothes.

616
01:34:32,115 --> 01:34:34,515
And I have a pair of good hands.

617
01:34:36,186 --> 01:34:40,122
- You're not afraid of lending a hand.
- No, I'm not.

618
01:34:43,126 --> 01:34:44,821
I'm not afraid of...

619
01:34:46,462 --> 01:34:49,954
... a cup of coffee in bed
Sunday morning either.

620
01:34:57,373 --> 01:34:59,671
Then I think I should have a kiss.

621
01:35:02,579 --> 01:35:04,979
Yes, you should.

622
01:35:20,597 --> 01:35:24,465
We must hope for happiness
and blessings for all three of us.

623
01:35:24,868 --> 01:35:27,462
You already like the boy.
I know that.

624
01:35:34,711 --> 01:35:36,872
You'd better stay the night.

625
01:35:44,254 --> 01:35:47,553
But I must be back
before the cows wake.

626
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,085
And Pelle's all alone.

627
01:36:09,545 --> 01:36:10,534
Pelle ...

628
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:15,316
Come on, Pelle.

629
01:36:19,055 --> 01:36:24,550
Everything's been arranged now.
We'll have a house and home.

630
01:36:25,028 --> 01:36:29,328
And a beautiful mother too.
Madame Olsen. You'll be happy.

631
01:36:31,734 --> 01:36:35,329
And maybe we'll get coffee
in bed Sunday mornings.

632
01:36:45,882 --> 01:36:49,784
Give us this day our daily bread ...

633
01:36:51,688 --> 01:36:54,088
Is that the book of biblical stories?

634
01:36:56,559 --> 01:37:01,428
Does it have the one about the man
whose sons pulled down his pants?

635
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:06,233
- Noah?
- Yeah, old man Noah.

636
01:37:07,303 --> 01:37:09,965
- What did he drink, old man Noah?
- Wine.

637
01:37:10,406 --> 01:37:15,400
Was it wine? Then he must have
been a fine man, old Noah.

638
01:37:15,611 --> 01:37:21,208
Then there was the one about
the man who was so devilish clever.

639
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:24,445
- Laban.
- Laban, of course.

640
01:37:24,587 --> 01:37:28,148
lmagine forgetting that... Laban.

641
01:37:28,825 --> 01:37:32,522
How was it now?
Could you have two wives then?

642
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,567
The great prophets. Let me see ...

643
01:37:42,271 --> 01:37:44,671
lsaiah and Daniel ...

644
01:37:46,642 --> 01:37:52,080
I remember them. If you want to
you can ask me about the prophets.

645
01:37:52,915 --> 01:37:54,246
Okay, let's hear them.

646
01:37:54,417 --> 01:37:57,875
You better stop reading now.
Otherwise you may lose track.

647
01:37:58,021 --> 01:37:59,818
Of the four great prophets?

648
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:08,558
Let's hear them.

649
01:38:09,365 --> 01:38:12,334
Well, first I have to make sure
I have them all.

650
01:38:14,404 --> 01:38:17,168
I don't understand
where they have gone.

651
01:38:17,306 --> 01:38:21,538
There's lsaiah ... and Daniel ...

652
01:38:25,982 --> 01:38:28,507
No, I can't do it today, Pelle.

653
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:31,677
- Think of how old I am.
- lsaiah, Daniel ...

654
01:38:31,888 --> 01:38:37,155
lsaiah, Daniel, Jesus...

655
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:41,221
No, not Jesus.
Of course not... Not him.

656
01:38:41,364 --> 01:38:44,765
They sure had devilish names.

657
01:38:44,934 --> 01:38:46,424
Try, papa.

658
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:54,876
lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel ...

659
01:38:55,745 --> 01:38:58,009
- And ... and ...
- Jeremiah!

660
01:38:58,147 --> 01:38:59,705
And Jeremiah!

661
01:38:59,849 --> 01:39:06,015
lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel
and Jeremiah.

662
01:40:23,696 --> 01:40:25,536
Will you never grow up?

663
01:40:55,363 --> 01:40:58,662
Don't be afraid.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

664
01:41:48,683 --> 01:41:51,117
Erik are you coming?

665
01:41:53,988 --> 01:41:55,683
To the fair, Erik.

666
01:41:59,494 --> 01:42:00,961
Come on, Erik.

667
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,629
Come on!

668
01:42:07,969 --> 01:42:09,698
Come on, Erik.

669
01:42:13,474 --> 01:42:15,066
Isn't he coming?

670
01:42:18,012 --> 01:42:21,209
He can't stay alone here
without the manager.

671
01:42:23,685 --> 01:42:26,984
Can't you go get him?
You're the only one he Iistens to.

672
01:42:27,121 --> 01:42:29,817
Coming with us to the fair,
Erik old boy?

673
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:35,727
Come on, Erik. Come on!

674
01:42:37,832 --> 01:42:39,857
Aren't you coming to the fair?

675
01:43:18,673 --> 01:43:22,734
lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah.

676
01:43:22,944 --> 01:43:27,142
lsaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah.

677
01:43:27,949 --> 01:43:32,613
Those were the days.
Imagine, two wives, Pelle.

678
01:43:32,754 --> 01:43:36,622
One could make coffee and
the other could mend and sew.

679
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:10,958
Smile at the world,
and the world smiles back at you.

680
01:47:36,697 --> 01:47:38,221
What's going on here?

681
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:46,966
I'm leaving, Aunt.

682
01:47:48,542 --> 01:47:50,772
But Signe, dear child...

683
01:47:53,614 --> 01:47:56,708
I don't really Iike Iiving in the country.

684
01:47:58,252 --> 01:48:02,882
I want to learn to take care
of myseIf. I've decided to...

685
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:07,818
- You might have said something.
- I should have said it earlier.

686
01:48:07,962 --> 01:48:10,294
But dear child, I don't understand.

687
01:48:11,499 --> 01:48:14,195
I miss the city so...

688
01:48:15,169 --> 01:48:16,830
But I thought...

689
01:48:17,538 --> 01:48:21,235
Kongstrup and I were sure
you were happy here.

690
01:48:23,577 --> 01:48:25,169
Dear Signe...

691
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:30,244
I'm sorry, Aunt, but I don't think...

692
01:48:31,752 --> 01:48:36,951
So suddenly. If you had said it
earlier I could understand.

693
01:48:38,025 --> 01:48:40,653
- Sorry, Aunt.
- But you might have...

694
01:48:42,463 --> 01:48:47,059
Why can't you look me
in the eye when we talk?

695
01:48:51,739 --> 01:48:53,969
How will you manage the trip?

696
01:48:54,942 --> 01:49:01,279
- And so suddenly...
- Kongstrup will take me to the boat.

697
01:49:01,415 --> 01:49:03,940
Oh thank God. I was so worried.

698
01:49:04,251 --> 01:49:08,881
If only I could understand.
We'II miss you terribly.

699
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:13,187
I imagined Kongstrup and I,
we would sit here...

700
01:49:13,327 --> 01:49:15,921
...and watch you run
this glorious place.

701
01:49:16,063 --> 01:49:21,865
Signe, my dear, don't cry.
My dear...

702
01:49:22,436 --> 01:49:27,703
You can always visit us
whenever you want.

703
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:50,697
Kongstrup!

704
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:53,758
Kongstrup!

705
01:49:57,138 --> 01:49:59,299
Come out and let me talk to you.

706
01:50:01,709 --> 01:50:04,109
You owe me money, Kongstrup.

707
01:50:05,179 --> 01:50:06,441
Kongstrup!

708
01:50:25,933 --> 01:50:28,094
Miss Signe...

709
01:50:29,737 --> 01:50:31,637
Let me say hello to you.

710
01:50:34,175 --> 01:50:36,473
Are you too proud
to say hello to me?

711
01:50:37,344 --> 01:50:39,608
One person's just
as good as another.

712
01:50:40,648 --> 01:50:45,984
Is it because you' re going away
to have your child?

713
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:48,315
I had mine in a turnip patch.

714
01:50:48,455 --> 01:50:51,151
But it was the same old
whoremonger, wasn't it?

715
01:50:52,893 --> 01:50:54,690
Signe... Signe.

716
01:50:57,031 --> 01:51:00,728
Go up to the old whoremonger.
I'm afraid of the Missus.

717
01:51:02,736 --> 01:51:04,533
- Come on.
- Let me go!

718
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:09,669
Kongstrup, come out and
heIp an old sweetheart!

719
01:51:09,810 --> 01:51:12,278
Let me go! Let me go!

720
01:51:13,214 --> 01:51:15,182
Get out! Out!

721
01:52:22,416 --> 01:52:23,815
What are you staring at?

722
01:52:39,633 --> 01:52:41,828
- Why are you late?
- Sorry.

723
01:53:00,621 --> 01:53:02,316
I don't understand.

724
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:06,487
Only death can put an end
to grief so quickly.

725
01:53:07,127 --> 01:53:09,823
She must have a damned
good grip on herseIf.

726
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:27,771
Wake u p and fetch the doctor.
Quick!

727
01:54:31,245 --> 01:54:35,739
- What is it, papa?
- I don't know.

728
01:54:43,123 --> 01:54:45,853
What is it? What happened?

729
01:54:46,493 --> 01:54:49,894
- It's so terrible.
- She cut him.

730
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:52,624
- The Missus cut him.
- What happened?

731
01:54:54,535 --> 01:54:59,029
The Missus cut him.
He's bleeding badly. Get heIp.

732
01:55:48,889 --> 01:55:51,289
See what it says about Pelle.

733
01:56:28,228 --> 01:56:31,356
Could Master Friis teII me
what this means?

734
01:56:33,333 --> 01:56:37,030
"Pelle is the young cuckoo
in Madame Olsen's nest."

735
01:56:37,671 --> 01:56:41,368
- Isn't she married to a sailor?
- She's boatsman Olsen's wife.

736
01:56:41,508 --> 01:56:43,772
He sleeps with her at night.

737
01:56:45,078 --> 01:56:47,774
Your father doesn't care,
does he, Pelle?

738
01:56:48,749 --> 01:56:50,216
Watch out lecher's son!

739
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:52,682
Pelle's father Iikes married women.

740
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:56,118
Pelle's father is a whoremonger.

741
01:57:10,871 --> 01:57:12,964
He's in for a beating.

742
01:57:14,174 --> 01:57:16,335
The cuckoo bird is in for a beating.

743
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:18,068
Here's one from boatsman Olsen.

744
01:57:28,822 --> 01:57:31,723
Just wait, Pelle, we'II get you.

745
01:58:03,924 --> 01:58:05,221
Pelle...

746
01:58:07,294 --> 01:58:10,058
I've been turning it over in my mind...

747
01:58:12,666 --> 01:58:15,260
Shouldn't we move down
to Madame Olsen's?

748
01:58:19,473 --> 01:58:21,532
I've talked to her about it.

749
01:58:29,182 --> 01:58:34,984
It's against the law to move in with
someone who's stiII married...

750
01:58:35,789 --> 01:58:43,423
...but my whole body aches
sometimes to have my own.

751
01:58:45,832 --> 01:58:48,926
Pelle, we could make it look
Iike we were lodgers.

752
01:58:53,707 --> 01:58:58,144
She could sew you new clothes.
You're growing out of the old ones.

753
01:59:02,616 --> 01:59:07,519
If I move into Madame Olsen's,
you'd come too, wouldn't you?

754
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:14,920
It's easy for you, Pelle.
You have your years ahead of you.

755
01:59:15,062 --> 01:59:19,089
I'm beginning to get old and I
need someone to take care of me.

756
01:59:19,232 --> 01:59:22,224
You just go ahead and move,
and I'II run away.

757
01:59:23,203 --> 01:59:27,833
You're so smug and proud. Look
how you' re cutting up the post...

758
01:59:27,974 --> 01:59:31,808
...and someone e lse has to
fiII in the holes with cow dung.

759
01:59:31,945 --> 01:59:33,936
Stop that now, Pelle!

760
01:59:34,081 --> 01:59:37,881
Watch out I don't cut a picture of
you and Madame Olsen on the gate.

761
01:59:38,018 --> 01:59:39,315
You rascal!

762
01:59:39,453 --> 01:59:43,890
Watch out I don't set
the manager on to you.

763
01:59:57,738 --> 01:59:58,932
Pelle!

764
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:07,610
Could you go by Madame Olsen
on the way home from school?

765
02:00:09,282 --> 02:00:12,479
Here are some things
she promised to mend for us.

766
02:00:14,154 --> 02:00:16,782
And teII her I'II come by this eveni ng.

767
02:00:17,057 --> 02:00:20,322
Why don't you marry her properly
Iike others do.

768
02:00:20,927 --> 02:00:23,691
We wiII...
We wiII, Pelle...

769
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:27,459
...but it takes time
with the authorities.

770
02:00:28,001 --> 02:00:31,061
Boatsman Olsen's
death certificate and all.

771
02:00:32,072 --> 02:00:34,597
But soon there wiII be coffee in bed.

772
02:00:54,428 --> 02:00:57,727
WeII, here's Madame Olsen's
young cuckoo.

773
02:01:21,188 --> 02:01:23,486
Let's see how strong you are, Pelle.

774
02:01:25,392 --> 02:01:28,486
- Into the sea with him!
- Jump, Pelle!

775
02:01:32,265 --> 02:01:34,096
Whoremonger's son!

776
02:01:37,137 --> 02:01:39,230
Go back to Sweden!

777
02:01:41,208 --> 02:01:43,369
Let's see how good you are.

778
02:01:46,813 --> 02:01:49,646
- Into the sea with him!
- Jump, Pelle!

779
02:01:50,417 --> 02:01:54,911
- Show us what you can do.
- Papa's Iittle Pelle, come on.

780
02:01:55,789 --> 02:01:57,279
How about a Iittle dance?

781
02:01:57,491 --> 02:02:01,450
What's the Iittle cuckoo going to do?
Show us what you can do.

782
02:02:01,695 --> 02:02:04,391
Go back to Sweden,
you whoremonger's son.

783
02:02:04,831 --> 02:02:06,822
- Fly away cuckoo bird!
- Cuckoo bird!

784
02:03:42,162 --> 02:03:44,289
Look! It's boatsman Olsen!

785
02:04:13,893 --> 02:04:15,326
Are you back already?

786
02:04:21,935 --> 02:04:24,768
Madame Olsen's husband
has come home.

787
02:05:39,512 --> 02:05:43,676
First they pluck one feather
and then another.

788
02:05:43,817 --> 02:05:49,050
And finally you stand there
Iike a plucked chicken in the shit.

789
02:05:49,389 --> 02:05:54,691
I thought I was going to have
a peacefuI old age. I've slaved...

790
02:05:55,729 --> 02:05:59,290
I'm just a poor, miserable man.

791
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,900
Oh, Jesus.

792
02:06:04,003 --> 02:06:05,971
Jesus, heIp me.

793
02:07:25,185 --> 02:07:27,881
What's the point of grieving?

794
02:07:29,989 --> 02:07:32,924
Here... this is my new sweetheart.

795
02:07:34,961 --> 02:07:36,394
Kiss her, lad.

796
02:07:43,002 --> 02:07:47,200
Oh, you're too fine for that, are you?

797
02:07:49,375 --> 02:07:54,210
WeII it doesn't heIp
to go around whimpering.

798
02:08:00,253 --> 02:08:01,811
Stop it, papa.

799
02:08:03,957 --> 02:08:06,152
Frisky isn't she?

800
02:08:11,164 --> 02:08:13,189
Easy now, you deviI!

801
02:08:19,505 --> 02:08:21,530
You're crying, son.

802
02:08:23,943 --> 02:08:26,411
Has someone hurt you?

803
02:08:26,946 --> 02:08:31,474
Don't you know your father's
name is Lasse Karlsson?

804
02:08:31,618 --> 02:08:34,587
It's alright. Lasse is here.

805
02:08:36,122 --> 02:08:38,886
You can be sure he'II prove...

806
02:08:43,129 --> 02:08:46,189
Your father can stand
on his own two feet.

807
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:51,565
Now the bastard's going to
answer for all these years.

808
02:08:52,238 --> 02:08:56,834
We'II have a talk with Missus
and her whoremonger.

809
02:09:40,086 --> 02:09:41,519
Erik?

810
02:09:49,996 --> 02:09:52,658
Spring is coming.
That's what papa says.

811
02:09:56,803 --> 02:09:58,737
Then you'II be a free man.

812
02:09:59,772 --> 02:10:01,467
We can leave, Erik.

813
02:10:03,676 --> 02:10:06,406
We can leave this awfuI place...

814
02:10:07,747 --> 02:10:10,375
...and go out and
conquer the world, Erik.

815
02:10:35,308 --> 02:10:36,400
Pelle...

816
02:10:38,277 --> 02:10:42,509
- What do they say about us?
- Wouldn't know.

817
02:10:43,316 --> 02:10:45,307
H aven't you heard anything?

818
02:10:45,451 --> 02:10:48,909
Do you think I'II go to school
and be made a fool of?

819
02:11:06,105 --> 02:11:09,666
The Lord forgive me
for abusing his gifts...

820
02:11:10,510 --> 02:11:14,071
...but it's a terrible temptation
when you' re broken-hearted.

821
02:11:21,988 --> 02:11:26,652
If I promise you'II never again
see your father Iike yesterday...

822
02:11:26,893 --> 02:11:30,693
...would you then go
to school tomorrow, Pelle?

823
02:11:31,264 --> 02:11:33,391
We'II puII through this.

824
02:11:34,901 --> 02:11:38,860
You have to go or there wiII be
trouble with the authorities.

825
02:12:09,669 --> 02:12:10,693
Master Friis?

826
02:12:11,437 --> 02:12:12,927
Master Friis?

827
02:12:13,873 --> 02:12:15,135
He's sleeping.

828
02:12:15,441 --> 02:12:17,636
Master Friis, it's two o'clock.

829
02:12:26,986 --> 02:12:30,547
Master Friis, it's two o'clock.
Time to go home.

830
02:13:36,656 --> 02:13:39,124
WeII, Pelle...
Where's your father?

831
02:13:42,562 --> 02:13:44,223
Is he out running about?

832
02:13:46,766 --> 02:13:49,564
I'm sure my father would be
happy to marry him...

833
02:13:49,702 --> 02:13:52,068
...as boatsman Olsen's second wife.

834
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,840
HeIp me!

835
02:14:05,318 --> 02:14:08,185
How dare you hit my son,
you scoundreI?

836
02:14:10,089 --> 02:14:13,081
You'II hear from the
authorities about this!

837
02:14:22,068 --> 02:14:26,368
That was about the worst you
could do, hit the minister's son.

838
02:14:26,505 --> 02:14:30,271
He deserved it, I'm sure, but
stiII you should n't have done it.

839
02:14:30,409 --> 02:14:31,933
They'II send you away.

840
02:14:33,012 --> 02:14:37,005
He said he could get you married
as boatsman Olsen's second wife.

841
02:14:37,183 --> 02:14:38,514
Oh, he did...

842
02:14:39,986 --> 02:14:41,351
Did he!

843
02:14:42,421 --> 02:14:46,357
If I had him here,
I'd rip his innards out.

844
02:14:46,859 --> 02:14:50,056
- Did you give him what he deserved?
- No, not really.

845
02:14:50,196 --> 02:14:53,654
He squealed Iike a pig and
his father came running.

846
02:14:53,799 --> 02:14:54,857
Damn.

847
02:14:56,335 --> 02:14:58,963
This isn't good.

848
02:15:00,973 --> 02:15:03,203
And you don't intend to apologize?

849
02:15:04,243 --> 02:15:06,234
No, no you shouldn't.

850
02:15:09,382 --> 02:15:12,749
Although maybe you should...
No, no.

851
02:15:13,653 --> 02:15:18,420
You have to twist and turn
as the eel said in the frying pan.

852
02:15:22,895 --> 02:15:25,523
I hope the proprietor won't mind.

853
02:15:25,665 --> 02:15:30,364
We have no choice,
but to ask for heIp.

854
02:15:31,437 --> 02:15:33,735
Did you blow your nose
properly, Pelle?

855
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:37,502
I hope the proprietor won't mind.

856
02:15:46,352 --> 02:15:50,413
- There's probably no one home.
- We can't stand here all day.

857
02:15:50,523 --> 02:15:53,924
Go first then, if you think
you can handle this better.

858
02:16:00,933 --> 02:16:02,127
Good day.

859
02:16:04,036 --> 02:16:05,833
It's Iike this you see...

860
02:16:08,774 --> 02:16:12,039
I hope the proprietor won't mind...

861
02:16:13,746 --> 02:16:15,236
That he won't mind...

862
02:16:20,219 --> 02:16:24,155
Forgive us for coming, this has
nothing to do with the farm.

863
02:16:29,495 --> 02:16:33,989
But when the sins of a father
are visited upon his son, then...

864
02:16:37,036 --> 02:16:38,731
Are you standing there?

865
02:16:39,205 --> 02:16:40,502
Sit down by all means.

866
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:44,200
Why haven't you
offered them a seat, dear?

867
02:16:54,553 --> 02:16:57,522
What is it? Money?

868
02:17:02,728 --> 02:17:04,628
No, it's j ust that...

869
02:17:07,967 --> 02:17:10,663
I hope Ma'am won't mind, but it's...

870
02:17:14,607 --> 02:17:18,441
It's the boy.
They' re going to send him away.

871
02:17:18,911 --> 02:17:21,471
Send him away?
What have you done?

872
02:17:28,554 --> 02:17:31,045
I hit and kicked the minister's son.

873
02:17:31,924 --> 02:17:33,482
And why did you do that?

874
02:17:37,596 --> 02:17:40,326
Because he said
eviI things about Lasse.

875
02:17:41,467 --> 02:17:42,798
What did he say?

876
02:17:48,607 --> 02:17:51,906
He called me
boatsman Olsen's second wife.

877
02:17:52,211 --> 02:17:55,271
Like, in the story
in the bible, I suppose.

878
02:18:00,786 --> 02:18:05,018
I was... Madame Olsen's sweetheart.

879
02:18:05,157 --> 02:18:08,149
Everyone thought
she was a widow and then...

880
02:18:09,795 --> 02:18:12,764
The other day,
her husband came home.

881
02:18:16,836 --> 02:18:17,825
Have one.

882
02:18:20,272 --> 02:18:23,833
- And then Pelle got furious.
- Yes, unfortunately.

883
02:18:24,376 --> 02:18:29,177
That's how it is with poor wretches.
They're only there to be pecked at.

884
02:18:29,348 --> 02:18:33,216
WeII, I prefer  the bid that
pecks back and defends his nest...

885
02:18:33,352 --> 02:18:34,944
...no matter how poor it is.

886
02:18:35,454 --> 02:18:39,185
I'II do what I can.
Don't worry about it anymore.

887
02:18:39,892 --> 02:18:40,984
Thank you.

888
02:18:42,761 --> 02:18:47,027
Oh by the way,
Kongstrup and I decided.

889
02:18:47,967 --> 02:18:51,425
The old trainee is
leaving us this Spring.

890
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:56,698
Maybe Pelle would Iike to become
trainee here on Stone Farm.

891
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:03,944
Thank you. Thank you very much.

892
02:19:18,297 --> 02:19:22,097
Did you notice how I let the Missus
know you'd Iike to be trainee?

893
02:19:22,234 --> 02:19:24,794
AImost as if she thought
it was her own idea.

894
02:19:26,272 --> 02:19:30,971
These belonged to the old trainee.
They're a bit big.

895
02:19:31,143 --> 02:19:32,633
Try them on, Pelle?

896
02:19:37,883 --> 02:19:40,784
I'II get some boot wax,
and they'II be Iike new.

897
02:19:41,654 --> 02:19:43,645
WeII the n...

898
02:19:48,527 --> 02:19:52,258
Stand up straight, Pelle.

899
02:19:52,765 --> 02:19:55,063
Shoulders up and chin forward.

900
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:58,601
No, Iift your chin. There.

901
02:19:58,737 --> 02:20:03,765
Now a sharp look in your eye. You
must command respect for yourseIf.

902
02:20:04,209 --> 02:20:07,372
Posture and the look in the eye.
That's what does it.

903
02:20:10,649 --> 02:20:14,050
No more hard work.
Just giving orders.

904
02:20:14,186 --> 02:20:18,088
"You can't take tonight off.
The stables must be cleaned."

905
02:20:20,759 --> 02:20:25,492
And Pelle, maybe you'II get to eat
Sunday dinner with the proprietor.

906
02:20:25,631 --> 02:20:28,623
And have your own napkin-ring
with your name on it.

907
02:20:28,767 --> 02:20:30,735
Pelle Karlsson written on it.

908
02:20:42,648 --> 02:20:46,345
And who knows, Pelle. Maybe
one day you'II be the manager.

909
02:20:47,152 --> 02:20:50,349
I could see what the Missus thought.

910
02:21:18,283 --> 02:21:19,341
Erik!

911
02:21:24,223 --> 02:21:25,417
Erik!

912
02:21:28,727 --> 02:21:32,322
Wait, Erik! Wait for me!

913
02:22:03,362 --> 02:22:04,488
I won't...

914
02:22:09,101 --> 02:22:10,830
We have to leave here, papa.

915
02:22:12,304 --> 02:22:13,532
Now, papa!

916
02:22:44,503 --> 02:22:47,438
- Oh, it's Karna.
- I'm glad I caught you.

917
02:22:47,906 --> 02:22:51,069
I was afraid the manager and
the Missus would see me.

918
02:22:51,310 --> 02:22:53,608
I came to give you this quiIt.

919
02:22:54,146 --> 02:22:58,947
It'II keep you warm, no matter
where you end up in the world.

920
02:23:00,085 --> 02:23:01,643
Goodbye, Gabriella.

921
02:23:05,424 --> 02:23:08,621
Goodbye, Blakka. Be good.

922
02:23:19,004 --> 02:23:20,699
WeII, Aspasia.

923
02:23:20,873 --> 02:23:24,707
Say good bye to Pelle, cause he's
going out to see the big world.

924
02:23:34,052 --> 02:23:35,246
Papa...

925
02:23:42,161 --> 02:23:43,355
What is it?

926
02:23:50,536 --> 02:23:52,003
Can't we stay?

927
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:24,498
You'II have to run away
without me, Pelle.

928
02:24:24,636 --> 02:24:27,196
I'm too old to traveI.

929
02:24:27,339 --> 02:24:32,367
I don't have the strength anymore.

930
02:24:34,613 --> 02:24:36,706
I'm too old.

931
02:24:40,385 --> 02:24:42,353
Do you understand that?

932
02:25:03,141 --> 02:25:05,541
We'II make a bundle for you.

933
02:25:05,677 --> 02:25:10,114
You can have two of my shirts
then you'II have four.

934
02:25:10,249 --> 02:25:12,240
The one you' re wearing is clean.

935
02:25:12,384 --> 02:25:16,320
And remember: never wear it
more than two weeks at a time...

936
02:25:16,455 --> 02:25:18,514
...otherwise you'II get
a bad name in town.

937
02:25:18,657 --> 02:25:21,592
And change your socks
before they wear out.

938
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:23,994
He who changes his clothes in time...

939
02:25:24,129 --> 02:25:26,996
...saves half the work
and all the shame.

940
02:25:30,002 --> 02:25:32,197
And you can have my boots too.

941
02:25:34,273 --> 02:25:36,605
Though they're a bit worn.

942
02:25:40,279 --> 02:25:42,304
And here's the Bible.

943
02:25:46,852 --> 02:25:51,721
Mama Bengta wanted you
to have it the day we parted.

02:26:22,454 --> 02:26:26,754
N ext time we'll meet maybe you'll
have a proper home to come to.

02:26:31,496 --> 02:26:33,327
Say hello to Karna for me.

02:26:42,908 --> 02:26:44,603
Goodbye and thank you.
