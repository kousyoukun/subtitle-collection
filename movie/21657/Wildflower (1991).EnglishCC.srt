00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,744
OH, MY GOODNESS.
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

HERE YOU ARE.
YOU PUT THIS SHIRT ON,
RIGHT HERE.

'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT YOU BEIN'
A GIRL AND ME BEIN' A BOY.

COME ON, NOW.
NONE OF THAT.

596
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,960
IT'S SORT OF LIKE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, RIGHT AND WRONG?

597
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,262
SEE, UH, NICE IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

598

THIS RIGHT?
UH, WELL, NO.
UH, SEE--

NO, UH-UH.
NO, ALICE.

602
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:36,380
BECAUSE IT'S NOT NICE
TO SEE A BOY NAKED.

603
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,383
ALL RIGHT? 'CAUSE NOW BOYS
AND GIRLS ARE DIFFERENT.

UH-- BOYS HAVE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAN GIRLS.

DAMN. YOU BETTER NOT
MESS THIS TRUCK UP
ANY MORE THAN IT IS, BOY.

621
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:58,122
I NEVER HEARD OF NO BOOKWORM
FIXIN' NO TRUCK.

GIRL'S GONE CRAZY
ABOUT IT.
WELL, I WAS JUST THINKIN'.

626
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:27,251
YOU KNOW IT'S THE FIRST
INTEREST SHE'S EVER EXPRESSED
IN ANYTHING GIRLISH OR FEMININE.

627
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,255
SAMMY'S GONE PLUMB DUMB.
YOU BEEN POWERFUL
HARD ON HIM, JACK.

628
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:42,065

I DON'T KNOW.
CHANGED ALL OF A SUDDEN.
HE AIN'T NO FUN NO MORE.

THAT OUGHTA BE ENOUGH, AIN'T IT?

649
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,887
YEAH, MAYBE.
BUT I AIN'T NO PAWN BROKER.

COULD YOU REALLY?

652
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,496
THAT LOOKS MIGHTY OLD.
YOU SURE IT'S NOT AN HEIRLOOM?

653
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:23,100
NO. IT'S JUST A LOCKET

657
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:50,127
SAMMY.
PLEASE COME.

658
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,219
[ Ellie ]
SO WHY IS IT THAT YOU CAN'T GO
WITH ME TO SEE ALICE TODAY?

659
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,871
I JUST CAN'T.
NOW QUIT ASKING.

660
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,408
BUT, I MEAN, SAMMY,
IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK,

661
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,543
AND SHE KEEPS ON ASKIN'
OVER AN OVER WHERE YOU'RE AT.

662
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,545
BESIDES, SAMMY, I THOUGHT
WE'S DOIN' THIS TOGETHER.

663
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,547
NAH, I CAN'T SEE HER.
ALL RIGHT?

664
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,899
I DON'T KNOW.

665
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:16,403
SHE WAS DOWN AT THE LAKE.

666
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:20,407
AND I WAS A LITTLE TIRED.
AND SHE WASN'T WEARIN'
NO CLOTHES.

667
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:22,826
WHAT?

668
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,329
SAMUEL PERKINS,
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

669
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:28,832
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

670
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,835
I JUST LOOKED IN THOSE EYES...

671
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,837
AND THAT SMILE.

672
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,340
I NEVER SEEN A PRETTIER SMILE.

673

[ Sighs ]
WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS...

675
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:45,599
THAT'S THE PRETTIEST GIRL
I EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

676
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:50,470
AND IT WAS, UH--
IT WAS JUST LIKE--

677
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,473
- LIKE YOU WAS AN ANIMAL.
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?
- NO. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

678
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,928
YOU JUST WOULDN'T NEVER
DO THAT TO BERTHA, WOULD YOU?

679
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,364
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU REALLY LOVED ALICE.

680
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,568
BUT YOU DIDN'T NEVER ADMIT IT
'CAUSE YOU WAS TOO ASHAMED OF
HER BEIN' SO DIFFERENT AND ALL.

681
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:08,138
BUT YOU HONESTLY THINK
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR HER,
DON'T YOU?

682
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,742
WELL, ELLIE, I'M A LITTLE
MIXED UP, ALL RIGHT?

683
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,494
WHEN I'M WITH ALICE,
I THINK I LOVE HER.

684
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,634
SHE'S JUST NOT LIKE BERTHA,
AND SHE AIN'T LIKE YOU.

685
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:24,638
SHE'S MORE LIKE A--

686
00:50:24,638 --> 00:50:26,640
WELL, A LITTLE BABY.

687
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:30,894
SO MY MIND TELLS ME
I CAN'T LOVE HER.

688
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:34,998
BESIDES, BERTHA'S MY GIRL.
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
DON'T YA?

689
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,503
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND
MORE THAN YOU THINK I DO, SAMMY.

690
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,972
MEN AND BOYS
JUST MAKE ME SICK.

691

HOW SORRY I AM I DONE
WHAT I DONE.

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOT INTO ME--

'CEPT SEEIN' YOU LIKE THAT
IN THE WATER.

HAPPEN AGAIN.

THAT WHAT GIRLS ARE FOR?
NO. UH-UH.
GOD, NO, ALICE.

700
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,777
WE-- BOYS AND GIRLS,

WHEN THEY GET OLDER,
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO-- THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO LOVE EACH OTHER.

00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,186
WHAT LOVE?

703
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,389
WELL-- WELL, LOVE ISN'T
SOMETHING YOU CAN SEE,

704
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,791
AND IT AIN'T SOMETHING
YOU CAN TELL.

[ Jack ]
WATCH HIS HEAD.

765
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:43,106
SHE'S PRETTY BANGED UP,
BUT NOTHING'S BROKEN.

766
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,309
WHERE CAN SHE GO TO REST?
IN THE SHED,
WHERE SHE LIVES, DOC.

767
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:50,313
YOU ALL RIGHT, ALICE?

770
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,225
I UNDERSTAND MY TWO KIDS

WITHIN HIS REACH!

778
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,492
[ Jack ]
KIDS OUGHTN'T TO BE TREATED
THAT WAY.

779
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,996
HER REAL DADDY DIED,
IF IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

780
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:18,751
AT THE TIME I FELT--

[ Sammy ]
HOW BAD IS HE HURT, DOC?
I DON'T KNOW.

804
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,768
FOOL WON'T LET ME
GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL.

805
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:01,521
CAN'T MOVE HIS LEG.
HE'S PARALYZED IN THERE
RIGHT NOW.

806
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:03,973
SO IF HE STAYS PARALYZED
FOREVER MAYBE ALICE

832
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,668
HOW CAN I TAKE CARE OF

842
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,900
A ROOM FOR THIS ALICE.

853
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,173
[ Chuckles ]
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA

858
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:41,390
ANYWAY, THE WAY YOU GET THINGS
