4
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:49,467
Can you tell me,
does Delmar Barry live here?

5
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:23,600
Excuse me, Can you tell me,
is this where Delmar Barry lives?

6
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,034
He ain't here.

7
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:28,865
Go on inside, baby,

8
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:36,339
He's a friend of mine,

9
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:40,183
As a matter of fact,
he wrote this address down,

10
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:41,844
Right here.

11
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:46,554
There. As you can see,
that's Delmar's writing,

12
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,793
I sure had a hard time
finding this place,

13
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,624
That's his writing.

14
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,797
Like I said, he's a friend,

15
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:57,029
My name is John Rambo, We served
on the same team together in Nam.

16
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,632
I don't know if he ever
talked about me,

17
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:04,671
I've got a picture
of us together,, .

18
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,003
Somewhere,

19
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,040
This junk in my pocket,

20
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:12,405
Here it is, Here it is,

21
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:16,182
That's me,
That's Danforth, and Westmore,

22
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,320
Bronson, Drtega, and there's
Delmar right in the back,

23
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,753
We had to put him in the back
'cause he's so big.

24
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:23,153
If we didn't,
he'd take up the whole picture,

25
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:24,348
Look how big he is.

26
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:25,952
Delmar's gone.

27
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,352
Oh, What time will he be back?

28
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,592
He died,

29
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:32,127
What?

30
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:35,062
He died last summer.

31
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,701
Died. How?

32
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:42,399
Cancer,
Brought it back from Nam.

33
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:45,936
All that orange stuff
they spreaded around.

34
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:49,370
Cut him down to nothing,

35
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,440
I could lift him off the sheet,

36
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,825
I'm very sorry,

37
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,606
Morning, Annie,
How you doing, girls?

38
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,107
- Great, Thanks,
- You all right this morning?

39
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,249
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will.

40
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,125
- Morning, Dave,
- Hi, sheriff,

41
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,161
Gonna take a bath this week?

42
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:34,635
Morning,

43
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:42,246
You, uh, you visiting somebody
around here?

44
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,508
No.

45
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,514
You know, wearing that flag
on that jacket,

46
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:50,354
looking the way you do,

47
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,948
you're asking for trouble
around here, friend,

48
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:58,624
- Headed north or south?
- North.

49
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:01,297
Ah, jump in,

50
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:04,060
I'll make sure you're heading
the right direction, hmm?

51
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:18,471
- Where you headed?
- Portland.

52
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:21,042
Portland is south.
You said you were headed north,

53
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,681
You got someplace
I can eat around here?

54
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,458
There's a diner
about 30 miles up the highway.

55
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,928
Is there any law against me
getting something here?

56
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,828
Yeah, Me.

57
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,762
Why are you pushing me?

58
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,096
What did you say?

59
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:46,666
I said, why are you pushing me?
I haven't done anything to you.

60
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,102
You don't ask the questions
around here, I do. You understand?

61
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:51,410
Secondly,

62
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,981
we don't want guys
like you in this town,

63
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,814
Drifters.

64
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,042
First thing you know,

65
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:03,649
we got a whole bunch of guys
like you in this town. That's why.

66
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,514
Besides,
you wouldn't like it here,

67
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:10,552
This is, this is a quiet,
little town,

68
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,589
In fact,
you might say it's boring,

69
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,864
But that's the way we like it.

70
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,231
And I get paid
to keep it that way,

71
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,836
Boring,

72
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,114
Portland, straight ahead,

73
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,050
Now if you want
some friendly advice,

74
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:48,120
get a haircut and take a bath,

75
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,065
You wouldn't get
hassled so much,

76
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,260
Hope this ride helped you out.

77
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,437
You have a nice day, hmm?

78
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,508
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

79
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:44,012
Hey, I' m talking
to you, goddamn.

80
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,586
Let me see some ID,
Damn it!

81
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,555
You're under arrest,
You hear me?

82
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:56,181
Put your hands on the car.

83
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,092
Now you put your hands on the car
and you spread 'em.

84
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,893
Now you're gonna put your hands
on that car,

85
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,293
How you do it, you decide.
Right now!

86
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,135
Get your legs back,

87
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,376
Get 'em back!

88
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,813
You know, you try to be nice
to some people.

89
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,490
Well, what do we have here, huh?

90
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,563
Why would you be carrying
a knife like this?

91
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,066
- Hunting.
- Don't be a wise guy.

92
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,899
What do you hunt with a knife?

93
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,797
Name it,

94
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,373
- Hi, Will,
- Lester,

95
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,671
Buzz us in, will ya?

96
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,514
Talk about your
sorry-looking humanity,

97
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,050
Just another smart-ass drifter.

98
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,781
Good morning, Arthur.

99
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,920
Morning, Will,
What do ya got?

100
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:13,523
I want you to book
this gentleman for vagrancy,

101
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,790
resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon,

102
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,292
He says he uses it for hunting.

103
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,396
Hunting?
What do you hunt? Elephants?

104
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:25,398
Why don't you see
if you can clean him up.

105
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:27,297
He smells like an animal

106
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:35,942
- Hey, Mitch? Mitch?
- Yo.

107
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,740
- Escort this young man downstairs, would ya?
- Yes, sir.

108
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:41,319
Right this way, partner,

109
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,879
Right here.
That's it.

110
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:53,091
Dkay,
Here we go,

111
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,335
You know, it looks like
it's going to take ol' Leroy, .,

112
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:00,030
about ten years
to paint this hall,

113
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:04,864
- Why don't you paint it your damn self?
- Leroy, sling that paint,

114
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:07,343
- Mr. Ward?
- Hm-mm?

115
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,937
- Would you take this for me, please?
- Thank you,

116
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,107
Yeah.

117
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:19,251
Name?

118
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,347
Your name?

119
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:28,521
Your name?

120
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:35,459
Name?

121
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:40,999
Hey, if you're looking
for trouble,

122
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,205
you came to the right place,
buddy.

123
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,365
Wait a second,

124
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,279
Hey, you got three seconds
before I break your face in,

125
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:51,508
He means it,

126
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:52,975
Yeah. I do,

127
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:16,167
What do you know about that?
OI' Harry here's a soldier,

128
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:20,568
' Rambo, John J,?

129
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,038
You gonna talk to me,

130
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:28,507
I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier,

131
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,148
I'm starting
to dislike you, .,

132
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:36,514
a lot!

133
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,983
I'm gonna run
a make on him,

134
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,828
Put his name in the Teletype,

135
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,006
Now just roll it across.

136
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,782
Roll it,
Roll it across.

137
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:54,218
- Push it.
- It won't work that way. It'll only smear,

138
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:57,459
- Now roll it across!
- Look, you son of a bitch,

139
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,983
if you don't put
your goddamn hand down there,

140
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:02,760
I'm going to break it off.
Now, put it down, goddamn it!

141
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,966
Art, what the hell
is going on down here?

142
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:07,024
Oh, nothing I can't handle.

143
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,528
He won't let us print him, Will,

144
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,235
Leave the ink on the hand!

145
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,374
Just what is
your problem, huh?

146
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:19,672
Now, listen, hard ass,
as things stand right now,

147
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,484
you're facing the ass end of
a 90-day incarceration, plus a $250 fine, .,

148
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:26,644
which you don't look to me
like you can pay.

149
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:28,214
At 10:00 tomorrow morning,

150
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:30,216
you're going up
in front of that judge.

151
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,354
And you think we're tough,

152
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:36,427
Now we're going to make you a little bit more
presentable for your courtroom appearance.

153
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,861
And between now and then,
you can just impress the hell out of me., .

154
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:42,557
By doing exactly
as you're told.

155
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,562
Now clean him up,

156
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:51,997
All right, Preston,

157
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,977
I want you to go over there
and get that hose ready,

158
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:56,035
All right?

159
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,914
Holy shit!
Look at this,

160
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:04,680
- What the hell 's he been into?
- Who gives a shit?

161
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:08,285
All right, put your hands
on top of your head and turn around,

162
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,051
Oh, Christ!

163
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:16,588
We should report this to Teasle, Galt.
Look at that,

164
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:19,328
You just do
what I tell ya.

165
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:25,504
Galt, what the fuck was that?

166
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,370
Well, the man said
clean 'em up.

167
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:32,943
Clean him up.

168
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,577
Hey, Preston,

169
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:47,218
don't forget to get him
behind the ears!

170
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:55,293
How do you like that, huh?

171
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,124
What's the matter, Mitch?

172
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,898
Don't you like water sports?

173
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:10,010
Hurry it up.
It's time for my coffee break,

174
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,376
- Sit down,
- Easy, Sit down,

175
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:16,482
Sit down.
All right, Sit on the stool

176
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:19,917
Come on,

177
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:24,216
Damn! Damn, this boy's
hard to get ahold of.

178
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:29,096
Ward, don't worry about the soap,
He's tough,

179
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,723
- Just shave him, dry,
- All right,

180
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,364
How blind are you?
Can't you see this guy's crazy?

181
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:39,902
- Can't you see I don't give a shit?
- Yeah, I can see that,

182
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,663
Good, that's better,

183
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:46,203
See there, I knew he knew
what was good for him.

184
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,944
Just gonna shave you, partner.
Take it easy,

185
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,479
Take this, Mitch.

186
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,609
Don't move,

187
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,850
I don't want you
to cut your own throat.

188
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,788
Hey! Hey!

189
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,103
You son of a bitch!

190
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,627
Come on!

191
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,443
Get him off of me!

192
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,645
What the hell is...

193
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,185
Art? Art?

194
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:57,869
Hey, you can't...

195
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:05,239
Hey, hey,
wait a minute...

196
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:31,229
- I'm gonna get that son of bitch!
- Art, don't shoot!

197
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,231
Goddamn it! Don't shoot,
There's people down there,

198
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,799
Get help,
I'll go after him,

199
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,973
Move!
Look out!

200
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:40,613
Get out of the way!

201
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:21,737
Son of a bitch!

202
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:32,315
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail

203
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:34,806
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

204
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:56,413
I know you can hear me!

205
00:20:58,426 --> 00:20:59,790
You're finished!

206
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:02,918
You've gone as far as
you're gonna go!

207
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,159
As far as you're gonna go!

208
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:08,231
You hear me?

209
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,562
You hear me?

210
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:16,309
Mitch! Lester!

211
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,142
He's up there, beyond the draw.

212
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:23,008
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

213
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,079
Tell him to get out here
with his damn dogs right away,

214
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:28,012
And tell him to bring
the Dobermans,

215
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:30,253
It's gonna rain. We'll need dogs
that can hunt on sight,

216
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:31,254
Right!

217
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:33,551
Lester, tell Galt to get out
to the lumber camp.

218
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,530
- Tell him to get the helicopter up here.
- Right.

219
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:36,360
If they give him any shit,

220
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:40,092
tell him to cite them for obstruction
right on the spot!

221
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:45,869
We'll get him,
No problem,

222
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,094
Come on, Duke, Thunder,
Let's get him,

223
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,904
Come on, sweethearts,
That's it, babies.

224
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:26,633
Let's go get him!

225
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,078
We'll be done
in a couple of hours.

226
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,945
It won't be long before you have
this one stuffed and mounted, huh, Will?

227
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:36,676
- Didrt we go deer hunting here last year?
- Yeah. I got a couple bucks.

228
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:39,782
- I'll shoot anything,
- Hey, Mitch, up the hill,

229
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:01,699
Keep those dogs
away from me, Orval

230
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,269
I don't trust those bastards,

231
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:06,773
Keep moving, 'cause my dogs
can eat and run at the same time,

232
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,080
He's heading straight
for the top,

233
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,449
Is this guy supposed to be dangerous?
He's just dumb.

234
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,692
Hey, Walt,
you're spoiling the scent,

235
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,331
- Let my babies do the job.
- Go ahead.

236
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,332
I'm trailing you here.

237
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,267
- This is no good,
- Why?

238
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,270
There were three of us
on him in the cell block.

239
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:44,840
He went through us
like we werert even there.

240
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:47,410
Aw, come on.

241
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,544
Let's go, babies,
Come on, Duke,

242
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:23,978
Hey, hey.
Okay, Thunder.

243
00:25:59,215 --> 00:26:01,512
Come on, Duke,
We got him cornered,

244
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:04,742
Art, this is Teasle,
He's headed for Chapman Gorge.

245
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,880
Chapman Gorge,
Head him off.

246
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,721
Dh!

247
00:26:42,254 --> 00:26:43,948
There he is!
On the cliff!

248
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:02,965
Son of a bitch!

249
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,280
What the hell 's going on?

250
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:15,044
What are you doing?
We're just supposed to spot him.

251
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,580
Hold it steady,

252
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,116
I can't!
We're in a thermal draft.

253
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:22,552
Galt, he's stuck there,
He can't go anyplace,

254
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,850
If you don't fly
this thing right,

255
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:29,194
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill you.

256
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:32,354
Sheriff to Galt.

257
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:39,794
Hold it steady,
you son of a bitch!

258
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:41,670
Galt, come in, goddamn it!

259
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:44,809
Get in closer
and hold it steady.

260
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,403
Galt, I want to know
what's going on!

261
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,112
I got him,
Easy. Easy.

262
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:23,469
Dw! Jesus!

263
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,451
There he is!

264
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:43,454
He's over there, dummy.
Come on!

265
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:45,887
Go on!

266
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:50,130
Hey, soldier boy!

267
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:57,204
Move it, move it
down the side.

268
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:03,813
Hold it steady!

269
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:06,610
Come on!

270
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:14,084
Galt, get on this radio!
What's going on up there?

271
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:19,486
I want him alive, Galt!
You hear me?

272
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:20,259
Art, come in!

273
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:22,955
Watch out!

274
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:22,077
Art Galt, come in,
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!

275
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,579
Jesus Christ!
Look!

276
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:31,221
Jesus Christ,
Give me the binoculars, hurry.

277
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:35,760
Dh, no, no, no,
Shit!

278
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:42,060
Jesus Christ.

279
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,369
I can't figure it.

280
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,099
How'd he fall out?

281
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,339
Does it matter?

282
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,978
Let's nail this sucker's ass,
He can't be far.

283
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,638
Will!

284
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,279
Looks like
he wants to turn himself in,

285
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,544
There's one man dead!

286
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:43,889
It's not my fault!
I don't want any more hurt!

287
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,151
Freeze!

288
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:48,621
Stand right where you are!
Give yourself up!

289
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,326
But I didn't do anything!

290
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:53,295
Boy, don't make a move!
I'll blow your head off!

291
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:55,934
I didn't do anything!

292
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:58,867
Dw!

293
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,531
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

294
00:32:04,044 --> 00:32:06,511
Ward, goddamn it,
cease fire!

295
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:09,139
I think we hit him.

296
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,674
Let's get down there,
Move!

297
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:14,780
Sheriff to base.
Come in.

298
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:20,080
Go ahead, Will,

299
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:22,821
Lester, we're down
in the gorge,

300
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,394
Galt 's dead all right,
Where the hell is that goddamn chopper?

301
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:29,829
He won't come, Will,
Says there's a storm headed your way,

302
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:33,866
I don't give a goddamn what's on its way!
I want that chopper back here right now!

303
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:36,300
I don't want Galt 's body
out here all night.

304
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:37,574
I'll do what I can.

305
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:41,408
Will, you picked one hell of a guy to mess
around with. This came over the Teletype.

306
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:44,204
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.

307
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,879
He's a Green Beret. Congressional
Medal of Honor. Guy's a war hero.

308
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,278
Jesus, that freak?

309
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:52,883
I knew there was something
about that guy,

310
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,577
I double -checked it, Will.

311
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,556
What do you want me to do?

312
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:03,290
I want you to do what I told you
to do, goddamn it!

313
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:05,895
Get that chopper back here now!
Out!

314
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:12,902
Green Beret.
War hero.

315
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:15,403
That's great,

316
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,269
- That's just great.
- Why don't you shut your mouth?

317
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:19,372
Now what the hell 's
the matter with you guys?

318
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:21,637
He's one man.
He's wounded,

319
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:26,242
Those Green Berets,
they're real bad asses,

320
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:28,176
Why don't you let
the state police handle this?

321
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,683
Come here, boy,
Come here, goddamn it!

322
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:40,290
Look, look at him, look at him!
It's Art Galt, boy,

323
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:44,192
He and I were friends when your mama
was still wiping your nose!

324
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:48,592
Now he'd dead, He's dead
because of that psycho out there!

325
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:52,141
You listen to me, boy,
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.

326
00:33:52,141 --> 00:33:55,439
And I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver,

327
00:33:56,646 --> 00:34:00,843
And I'm gonna do it
with you or without you,

328
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:16,322
Dang! Twisted my ankle!

329
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,861
We're closing in.
The scent's getting stronger.

330
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:23,657
All right, keep your eyes open.

331
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:26,831
Come on, baby,

332
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:30,471
It's gonna storm.
That's all we need now.

333
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:33,304
Will, let' s get out of here
before it gets too dark.

334
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,543
What's the matter?
Are you afraid of the bogeyman?

335
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:36,977
You goddamn pansy,

336
00:34:37,182 --> 00:34:39,684
Ward, put your gun down.
I'll show you who the pansy is.

337
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:40,946
Dkay, come on down!

338
00:34:41,186 --> 00:34:42,914
Hey, guys, knock it off!

339
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:46,781
Ward, move on!
The fight is out there!

340
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,214
He's out there waiting for you!

341
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:51,320
Mitch, get on your feet
and move!

342
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:54,186
Let's go find this guy
for Christ's sake!

343
00:34:54,197 --> 00:34:56,061
- Keep your eyes open!
- Come on there, Duke!

344
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,688
I'll see you later, Ward!

345
00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,360
Shut up, Mitch!

346
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:06,070
Let's go, girl
Come on.

347
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,006
There he is!

348
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:11,713
Turn them loose!
Turn those dogs loose, Drval!

349
00:35:11,714 --> 00:35:14,409
Go get 'em, sweethearts!
There's your dinner!

350
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:27,158
Cease fire! Cease fire!

351
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:33,130
I'm hit!
Goddamn it, I'm hit!

352
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:38,499
Jesus. He's got a gun,

353
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,145
It's not him!
It's a goddamn scarecrow!

354
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:54,206
It was no scarecrow that shot Drval!
He's close, real close!

355
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:58,085
Kill 'im! Kill 'im!
Go get 'im! Go get 'im!

356
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,347
Go get 'im, Maggie!

357
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:11,095
Mitch!

358
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:14,326
Mitch, Ward, come here,

359
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,262
- Shingleton, you cover us.
- Look at his leg,

360
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:20,638
Mitch, get your belt.
Get a tourniquet around that,

361
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:22,902
We gotta get a doctor!

362
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:24,642
Goddamn it!
Get your belt on there fast!

363
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,781
- Where's the first aid kit?
- I left it in the car,

364
00:36:26,781 --> 00:36:28,941
- Shit!
- Where'd he get the gun?

365
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:30,909
It's got to be Art Galt 's gun.

366
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:32,775
- He's out of ammo.
- How do you know that?

367
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:34,788
Because whatever killed
that last dog was no bullet!

368
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:36,813
That's how. Hurry up!

369
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,417
Orval, listen to me,
You got to stay awake,

370
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:42,488
You got to release
that tourniquet every 15 minutes.

371
00:36:42,796 --> 00:36:44,092
We'll be right back!

372
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:45,524
We got to get him now.
He's out of ammo.

373
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:48,494
- Hurry up! Get him,
- He had no right to shoot my babies,

374
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:52,099
- Get the son of a bitch! Go get him!
- Come on! Let's go!

375
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,432
All right, All right.
Now, listen up,

376
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:59,299
We're right on top of him, We're gonna form
a skirmish line 50 feet apart.

377
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:02,438
And keep moving, There's no way
out of here except through us,

378
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:08,341
Dkay,
Let's do some hunting,

379
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:09,318
Hunting?

380
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:11,946
We ain't hunting him.
He's hunting us.

381
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:28,528
Spread out!
Spread out, damn it!

382
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:29,869
I said 50 feet!

383
00:37:49,422 --> 00:37:51,548
Dw! Damn!

384
00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:56,053
God, I hate this!

385
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:08,816
Ow! God!

386
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:13,356
- Will, it's Mitch!
- Oh, shit, Will!

387
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:15,857
Dh, God!

388
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:17,699
Will!

389
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,429
- Who is it?
- Will!

390
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,637
Will!

391
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:34,510
Mitch?

392
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:50,888
- What the hell 's going on?
- Son of a...

393
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,130
Oh! Will!

394
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:55,597
He's got Ward,

395
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:57,633
All right, spread out.
I'll go this way.

396
00:39:58,305 --> 00:39:59,896
Will!

397
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:04,436
Will! Dh! Dh! Will!

398
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:07,836
Over here!

399
00:40:08,314 --> 00:40:10,804
Will!
He's over here!

400
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:13,909
Hold your fire!

401
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,686
- Who the hell is firing?
- I got him! I got him!

402
00:40:18,824 --> 00:40:20,415
Shingleton, follow me!

403
00:40:21,827 --> 00:40:22,952
I got him!

404
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:29,355
Somebody help me!
Help me, Will!

405
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,426
- Will!
- Balford?

406
00:40:34,337 --> 00:40:37,032
- Balford, where the hell are ya?
- Will!

407
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:43,107
Help! Help me!

408
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:44,505
Balford?

409
00:40:49,351 --> 00:40:50,942
Shingleton, over here!

410
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:55,287
God. Jesus.

411
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:58,722
Easy. Easy.
All right. Hold it,

412
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:05,728
Jesus Christ!

413
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,732
Shingleton,
where the hell are ya?

414
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:14,169
Shingleton?

415
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:18,001
Shingleton?

416
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:20,936
Will!

417
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:24,439
Will!

418
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:27,873
Jesus Christ!

419
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:28,681
Jesus...

420
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,551
I could 've killed them all.

421
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,553
I could have killed you,

422
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,385
In town, you're the law,
Dut here, it's me.

423
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,262
Don't push it!

424
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,800
Don't push it, or I'll give you
a war you won't believe.

425
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,235
Let it go!

426
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:53,932
Let it go!

427
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:34,672
All right, Coming in,

428
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:45,320
- Come on. Get back,
- Move back, you guys, Move back,

429
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:57,296
Captain, can we have a comment
on what's happening?

430
00:42:57,466 --> 00:43:00,298
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...

431
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,402
Dnly good thing
to come out of this mess,, .

432
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:04,495
Is the business
we're doing in town.

433
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:06,531
Reporters are drinking
the place dry.

434
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:11,671
You look like you're ready
to keel over, Will.

435
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,982
Why don't you go home?
It's my problem now.

436
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:16,449
Your problem?
Listen, Dave,

437
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:20,613
don't give me any of your horseshit
about jurisdiction on this one, you understand?

438
00:43:20,988 --> 00:43:22,011
Would you like me
to step outside?

439
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:23,717
Just finish up
what you're doing,

440
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:26,856
Somewhere in this
rugged mountain countryside,

441
00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:30,292
possibly above the snow line,
shrouded in mist,

442
00:43:30,496 --> 00:43:33,055
the fugitive John Rambo
is hiding.

443
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:36,297
Units of the state police, along with
local members of the National Guard., .

444
00:43:36,502 --> 00:43:38,059
Are now being mobilized,

445
00:43:38,504 --> 00:43:40,801
What still remains unexplained
by local authorities., .

446
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:43,735
Is just how and where
the former Green Beret., .

447
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:46,033
Came into possession
of the weapons with which, .,

448
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:48,012
he allegedly killed
one deputy sheriff., .

449
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:49,604
And tried to kill six others.

450
00:43:50,014 --> 00:43:53,676
Dnly their skilled training in police
enforcement techniques saved their lives.

451
00:43:54,018 --> 00:43:58,147
Word is that the fugitive will be
in custody in a matter of hours,

452
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:01,011
Here's the maps, Will,

453
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:04,754
Will, there's something
I think you ought to know.

454
00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:07,529
Talk to you later. Dkay?

455
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,225
What is it, Lester?
What is it? Spit it out!

456
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:15,024
Well, I was,
I was just talking to Mitch,

457
00:44:15,537 --> 00:44:18,562
and he was saying that
Galt and a couple deputies,, .

458
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:20,632
Were, uh, a little hard
on the guy,

459
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:22,565
Assholes!

460
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:25,477
Doesrt make one goddamn
bit of difference, Dave,

461
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:26,842
and you know it!

462
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:30,141
Look, if one of my deputies,, .

463
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:32,051
Gets out of line
with a prisoner,

464
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:33,780
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

465
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:36,783
If I find out it's like he says,
I kick the deputy's ass!

466
00:44:37,557 --> 00:44:40,081
Me! The law!
That's the way it's got to be!

467
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,560
People start fuckir around
with the law., .

468
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:44,255
And all hell breaks loose!

469
00:44:47,066 --> 00:44:50,466
Whatever possessed God in heaven
to make a man like Rambo?

470
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:52,092
God didn't make Rambo.

471
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:56,198
- I made him.
- Who the hell are you?

472
00:44:56,574 --> 00:45:00,202
Sam Trautman,
Colonel Samuel Trautman.

473
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:02,909
We're a little busy, Colonel
What can I do for you?

474
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,240
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

475
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:07,481
I recruited him,
I trained him.

476
00:45:07,584 --> 00:45:10,051
I commanded him in Vietnam
for three years.

477
00:45:10,587 --> 00:45:12,110
I'd say that makes him mine,

478
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:17,820
I wonder why the Pentagon would send
a full -bird Colonel down here to handle this.

479
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:20,095
The Army thought
I might be able to help,

480
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:23,826
I don't know in what way,
Rambo's a civilian now. He's my problem,

481
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,794
I don't think you understand.

482
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,729
I didn't come here
to rescue Rambo from you,

483
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,004
I came here
to rescue you from him,

484
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:36,302
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel

485
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,440
I will try to be extra careful

486
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:42,206
I'm just amazed that he allowed
any of your posse to live,

487
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,412
Is that right?

488
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,914
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing.

489
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,109
That's just great!

490
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,350
Colonel, you came out here
to find out., .

491
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,716
Why one of your machines
blew a gasket.

492
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,626
You don't seem to want
to accept the fact, .,

493
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,356
that you're dealing with an expert
in guerrilla warfare.

494
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,791
With a man who's the best, .,

495
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,760
with guns, with knives,
with his bare hands,

496
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:06,364
A man who's been trained
to ignore pain,

497
00:46:06,637 --> 00:46:10,094
ignore weather,
to live off the land,

498
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:13,371
to eat things that would make
a billy goat puke,

499
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:17,169
In Vietnam, his job was
to dispose of enemy personnel

500
00:46:17,147 --> 00:46:19,171
To kill. Period,

501
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:21,206
Win by attrition,

502
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:23,880
Well, Rambo was the best,

503
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,296
Okay, Colonel, you got us all
scared to death,

504
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,230
What do you and the Special Forces
think I ought to do, .,

505
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,371
about your psycho out there?

506
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:29,904
Let him go.

507
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:31,941
- Do what?
- For now,

508
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:35,182
Diffuse the whole situation.
Diffuse him,

509
00:47:35,718 --> 00:47:38,277
Provide a little gap
and let him slip through it.

510
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,778
Then put out
a nationwide APB,

511
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:42,951
In a couple of weeks, you'll pick him up
in Seattle or someplace,

512
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:43,280
working in a car wash,

513
00:47:43,725 --> 00:47:45,419
There'll be no fight,
Nobody else will get hurt.

514
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:47,193
I do my own work,

515
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:51,095
I won't close my eyes and hope
he gets picked up in Seattle.

516
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:53,790
If you send your people in there
after him, they'll get killed,

517
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:57,101
We're just a small,
hick town sheriff's department,

518
00:47:57,237 --> 00:47:58,737
but we're expected
to do our duty., .

519
00:47:58,738 --> 00:48:00,932
Just like our heroes
in the Special Forces,

520
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:04,334
In Special Forces, we teach our people
to stay alive in the line of duty.

521
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:06,301
I never thought of that.

522
00:48:06,246 --> 00:48:07,405
You want a war you can't win?

523
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:11,806
Are you telling me that 200 men
against your boy is a no-win situation for us?

524
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,842
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.

525
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:14,217
What?

526
00:48:14,753 --> 00:48:17,016
A good supply of body bags.

527
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:20,951
Trautman!

528
00:48:24,262 --> 00:48:26,388
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman.

529
00:48:26,764 --> 00:48:29,231
I still think you came out here
just to cover your ass,

530
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:33,292
But if you're serious about
taking Rambo out clean, follow me.

531
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:46,042
Dang,

532
00:48:54,289 --> 00:48:57,655
State Police calling John Rambo.
Acknowledge.

533
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,663
State Police calling John Rambo.

534
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,097
Come in, please.
Acknowledge.

535
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:13,771
If you're listening, Rambo,
here is your situation.

536
00:49:13,806 --> 00:49:15,272
You are surrounded.

537
00:49:15,808 --> 00:49:17,866
Every possible exit
has been blocked,

538
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,812
Every highway, every road,
every firebreak,

539
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:22,506
You have our word that
your services to your country, .,

540
00:49:23,315 --> 00:49:24,645
will be taken
into consideration,

541
00:49:24,816 --> 00:49:26,578
and you will receive
fair treatment,

542
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:29,809
Just respond, We can work
everything out. Dver.

543
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,683
Anything?

544
00:49:32,323 --> 00:49:34,153
He took a radio off
of one of my deputies,

545
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:35,757
Then he has to be listening.

546
00:49:35,826 --> 00:49:38,259
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up information,

547
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:40,762
- Maybe catch some cross talk,
- Df course he's listening.

548
00:49:41,331 --> 00:49:43,093
But he's not gonna break
radio silence,

549
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,594
No, Not for us,

550
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:46,096
But he might do it
for you, Colonel

551
00:49:46,836 --> 00:49:48,393
He's your boy, isn't he?

552
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:51,532
Maybe you can
talk him into, .,

553
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,899
sparing all our lives
by giving himself up,

554
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:57,003
I can try.

555
00:49:57,846 --> 00:49:59,540
At least, we'll get
a radio fix on his position,

556
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:00,974
if you don't mind
setting him up for us,

557
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:05,341
Setting him up for you? It 's like
bringing the pigeons to the cat,

558
00:50:07,355 --> 00:50:08,912
Son of a bitch,

559
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:12,154
Hey, Don, thanks for
bringing your people out.

560
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:13,484
Any time, Will,

561
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,487
Bobby, put the magazine away,
Pay attention.

562
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:18,625
We may only get
one crack at this,

563
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:27,099
Covey Leader calling Raven.
Come on, Raven.

564
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,205
Covey Leader calling Raven.

565
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,677
Covey Leader to Raven.
Talk to me, Johnny.

566
00:50:40,885 --> 00:50:43,182
Covey Leader
to identify Baker Team,

567
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:46,320
Rambo, Messner,

568
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,220
Ortega, Coletta,

569
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:50,621
Jorgensen, Danforth,

570
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:55,091
Barry, Krackauer,
Confirm,

571
00:50:55,898 --> 00:50:57,592
This is Col. Trautman.

572
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:01,300
Talk to me, Johnny.

573
00:51:14,915 --> 00:51:16,472
They're all gone, sir.

574
00:51:17,418 --> 00:51:18,850
It's him. Get on it.

575
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,944
Rambo, are you all right?
Over.

576
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:23,786
Baker Team,
they're all dead, sir,

577
00:51:24,924 --> 00:51:27,357
Not Delmar Barry.
He made it.

578
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:30,258
Barry's gone too, sir.

579
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,793
How?

580
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:35,933
Got himself killed in Nam,
Didrt even know it,

581
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:37,525
Cancer ate him
down to the bone,

582
00:51:39,438 --> 00:51:41,029
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

583
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:43,964
I'm the last one, sir,

584
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:48,342
It's good to hear your voice, Johnny.
It's been a long time.

585
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:51,448
Look, John, you've done
some damage here,

586
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:53,575
- That's it. Northwest.
- But they don't want any more trouble,

587
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,348
He's northwest.

588
00:51:55,452 --> 00:51:56,884
That's why I've come,

589
00:51:58,455 --> 00:52:00,012
I'm gonna come in there
and fly you the hell out.

590
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:02,583
Just you and me.
We'll work this thing out together.

591
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:04,289
Is that fair enough?

592
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,620
Where'd you come from, sir?

593
00:52:06,962 --> 00:52:07,791
Bragg.

594
00:52:08,964 --> 00:52:12,160
I tried to reach you, but the guys at Bragg
never knew where to find you,

595
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:14,969
I haven't been spending
much time there lately.

596
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:18,096
They've got me down in D.C.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.

597
00:52:18,473 --> 00:52:20,599
I wish I was back at Bragg now,

598
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:25,808
We'll talk about that
when you come in,

599
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,377
I can't do that, sir.

600
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:34,044
Well, look, John, we can't have you
runnir around wastir friendly civilians.

601
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,352
There are no friendly civilians.

602
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:38,115
I'm your friend, Johnny.

603
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,823
I was there with you knee-deep
in all that blood and guts.

604
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:44,086
I covered your ass
more than once.

605
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:50,296
Seems like bailir you out of trouble
is gettir to be a lifetime job for me.

606
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:52,969
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king-shit cop.

607
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,995
All I wanted
was something to eat,

608
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,667
but the man
kept pushing, sir.

609
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,272
You did some pushing
of your own, John,

610
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,172
They drew first blood,
not me.

611
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,606
Look, Johnny,

612
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:07,606
let me come in and get you
the hell out of there.

613
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:11,645
They drew first blood.

614
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:22,860
Rambo,
are you still reading me?

615
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:29,467
Covey Leader to Raven,

616
00:53:31,038 --> 00:53:32,561
Rambo, acknowledge.

617
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:35,132
He's all finished, Colonel

618
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:37,771
We've got a real good
fix on him, though.

619
00:53:38,044 --> 00:53:40,603
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got up on that ridge,

620
00:53:42,048 --> 00:53:43,173
Then we'll get him my way,

621
00:53:45,552 --> 00:53:47,416
All right, look down. I want you
to stretch the skirmish line, .,

622
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:50,282
- right across this ridge.
- Goddamn it,

623
00:53:52,558 --> 00:53:53,546
Goddamn it.

624
00:53:58,563 --> 00:54:00,086
Come on. Let's go.
Over here,

625
00:54:03,568 --> 00:54:05,228
Come on! Move it!

626
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:08,798
Let's go,

627
00:54:10,073 --> 00:54:11,596
Hey, this guy got a gun?

628
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,306
Watch your step,

629
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,273
What was that?
What was that?

630
00:54:25,588 --> 00:54:26,645
Which way did he go?

631
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:28,612
Toss it across.
Toss it,

632
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:22,832
Pa! Pa! Pa!

633
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:24,605
- There's a guy over there!
- What happened, son?

634
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:27,302
- I see him! Dver there!
- I' II get him!

635
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:29,008
Don't shoot! Cool down!

636
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:31,771
This way! Let's go!

637
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:40,143
There he is!
Come on!

638
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:51,789
Whoo!

639
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,261
Now we got him!

640
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:05,109
Yes, Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Listen to me very carefully,

641
00:56:05,678 --> 00:56:08,305
Surround the area with every man
you've got, but don't move in.

642
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,376
I repeat, don't move in, In fact,
don't do anything 'til I get there,

643
00:56:11,683 --> 00:56:14,742
And no shooting. I don't want him dead.
I want him alive.

644
00:56:20,692 --> 00:56:21,885
Get down!

645
00:56:32,702 --> 00:56:33,861
Keep firir!

646
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:38,165
Come on, guys,
Shoot!

647
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:40,303
Come on!

648
00:56:43,044 --> 00:56:44,374
Oh, you guys are great,

649
00:56:45,046 --> 00:56:46,547
- All right, Steve?
- Yo?

650
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:49,380
I want you and Bruce, head around
these trees, go to the front of that mine,

651
00:56:49,551 --> 00:56:51,177
Screw that, Clinton,
I ain't goir up there,

652
00:56:51,553 --> 00:56:52,416
No way,

653
00:56:57,057 --> 00:56:58,353
- Raymond?
- What?

654
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,357
- I want you to go into that mine.
- Dh, not me,

655
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:04,564
- What do you mean, ' not me '?
- Look, I do this part-time,

656
00:57:04,564 --> 00:57:08,260
I didn't come to get killed.
He's probably in there just waitir for us.

657
00:57:09,068 --> 00:57:11,092
What's wrong with you,
Clinton?

658
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:18,804
All right, Rambo? This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgen,

659
00:57:19,578 --> 00:57:21,204
National Guard leader,

660
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:27,608
Now, I'm giving you just
three-zero seconds to come on out!

661
00:57:28,953 --> 00:57:30,544
Who's got
the rocket launcher?

662
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:33,112
- I do,
- Come here, Earl

663
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:38,425
Great, Rambo, this is
your last chance to come out,

664
00:57:40,096 --> 00:57:41,460
Maybe we should wait,

665
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,463
Earl, this creep is a killer,

666
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,295
Besides, I' m in charge,
and I say we blow it up.

667
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:49,626
Now fire that thing,

668
00:57:50,105 --> 00:57:51,833
Just let me
get out of the way first,

669
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,321
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

670
00:58:16,629 --> 00:58:18,789
Give that man a cigar!

671
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:20,290
Bull 's-eye!

672
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:03,034
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards,

673
00:59:06,674 --> 00:59:09,039
Move in a little closer,
just like Iwo Jima,

674
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:12,508
I don't believe it.

675
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,340
- Idiots!
- Steady, Got it,

676
00:59:14,682 --> 00:59:16,842
All right, Nick.
Dne more for Soldier of Fortune.

677
00:59:17,183 --> 00:59:18,649
Soldier of Fortune?

678
00:59:19,185 --> 00:59:21,948
Damn it! What the hell do you think
this is? Some kind of a circus?

679
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:23,586
Get the hell out of here!

680
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:26,657
Clinton, Jesus.

681
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:30,194
Didrt you get the word? I told you
people to wait until I got up here!

682
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:33,755
He was shootir at us, Will,
Come on, I wasrt takir any chances,

683
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,667
Christ, what a mess,

684
00:59:40,204 --> 00:59:42,467
We're gonna have to dig his body
out of there right away,

685
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:45,208
You can't get
a dozer up here,

686
00:59:45,209 --> 00:59:46,835
You'll have to find somebody
to dig him out,

687
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:49,405
It's your mess, Clinton,
You clean it up,

688
00:59:49,713 --> 00:59:50,406
Will, come on!

689
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:52,214
I gotta be back
at the drugstore tomorrow,

690
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:54,739
Then you better get started
right away, Clinton!

691
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,083
Shit!

692
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:46,594
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
goddamn weekend warriors.

693
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:49,289
I thought you said
he was the best you ever trained,

694
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:53,394
However he may have ended up, there was
a time when he was very special

695
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:57,001
Special, my ass, He's just
another drifter that broke the law,

696
01:00:57,274 --> 01:01:00,071
Vagrancy, wasrt it?
That's gonna look real good...

697
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:02,004
on his gravestone at Arlington,

698
01:01:02,779 --> 01:01:06,145
"Here lies John Rambo, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor,

699
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:09,478
survivor of countless incursions
behind enemy lines,

700
01:01:10,786 --> 01:01:13,481
killed for vagrancy
in jerkwarter, U.S.A."

701
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:16,222
Now don't give me
any of that crap, Trautman.

702
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:20,124
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?

703
01:01:20,795 --> 01:01:23,092
He killed a police officer
for Christ sake!

704
01:01:23,297 --> 01:01:25,127
You' re goddamn lucky
he didn't kill all of ya.

705
01:01:42,314 --> 01:01:46,443
This character, he comes waltzing in here
full of all kinds of good advice,, .

706
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:50,822
On how we should let the goddamn maniac
go loose so we can save our own asses!

707
01:01:50,823 --> 01:01:54,155
We saved our asses, Colonel,
and we didn't let him go loose!

708
01:01:54,826 --> 01:01:56,486
The best man lost!

709
01:01:57,328 --> 01:01:58,851
And he doesn't like it!

710
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:34,541
- How ya doir, Will?
- Hold my calls.

711
01:05:55,043 --> 01:05:56,202
Colonel?

712
01:06:01,048 --> 01:06:02,105
Have a seat,

713
01:06:08,055 --> 01:06:11,251
Dh, miss, would you
do this again, please?

714
01:06:11,057 --> 01:06:12,921
- Hi, sheriff.
- And for my friend,

715
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:15,549
Give me a shooter.
Wild Turkey,

716
01:06:18,064 --> 01:06:20,190
Look, if I was out of line before,

717
01:06:20,565 --> 01:06:22,759
well, I just want to apologize.

718
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:27,663
None of that makes
much difference now, does it?

719
01:06:29,574 --> 01:06:30,870
Nah, I guess not,

720
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:33,906
I suppose, .,

721
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:37,842
I don't know,
I just feel.,

722
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:43,540
Like you were cheated
out of your chance,

723
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:45,849
I wanted to kill that kid,

724
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,387
I wanted to kill him so bad
I could taste it,

725
01:06:51,593 --> 01:06:53,389
Doesrt sit well
with that badge, hmm?

726
01:06:55,097 --> 01:06:57,360
It can get confusing sometimes.

727
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:02,536
In Vietnam, you can bet that
Rambo and I got pretty confused.

728
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:05,162
But we had orders.

729
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:08,972
When in doubt, kill.

730
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:13,737
What the hell,
you're a civilian,

731
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:18,982
You can go home to your wife and your house
and your little flower garden,

732
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,381
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.

733
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,679
What about you, Colonel? What did you
figure out from all of this, huh?

734
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,647
What would you have done
with him if he came in?

735
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,627
Would you wrap your arms around him,
give him a big, sloppy kiss?

736
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,652
Dr would you have
blown his brains out?

737
01:07:40,638 --> 01:07:43,504
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face-to-face.

738
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:48,633
Yeah.
Well, there it is.

739
01:07:50,647 --> 01:07:52,944
It's just as well we never got
a chance to find out.

740
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:54,444
Hmm,

741
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:46,114
Drive.

742
01:09:49,254 --> 01:09:50,982
Don't look at me,
look at the road,

743
01:09:51,256 --> 01:09:52,882
That's how accidents happen.

744
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:57,386
- What's your name?
- Cathcan't, Robert A,

745
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,819
All right, what do ya got
in the back, Robert A.?

746
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:01,525
M60,

747
01:10:05,269 --> 01:10:06,769
Dkay, Robert A,,
get outta the truck.

748
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,292
Dh, please, I got no beef
with you. No!

749
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,533
Go on! Move! Go!

750
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:28,982
Whoa!

751
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:34,419
SP Car 1,
Charlie 5 to central

752
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:35,886
Want to turn that up?

753
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:37,057
Are we still on that
three-way hookup?

754
01:10:37,297 --> 01:10:38,820
Sheriff Teasle' s office,

755
01:10:39,299 --> 01:10:43,428
Roger. Still working.
What's your story, Steamboat?

756
01:10:44,304 --> 01:10:46,703
Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon.

757
01:10:46,806 --> 01:10:49,603
That Rambo guy is
on the loose again.

758
01:10:49,808 --> 01:10:50,296
Shit.

759
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:51,809
Roger, Steamboat.
This is Trapper.

760
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,538
We 're setting up roadblocks
on Highway 26.

761
01:10:54,313 --> 01:10:57,110
Hey, Will, it's Rambo,
He's still around,

762
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:39,511
Holy fuck!

763
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,912
All right, get out there
right away, Move!

764
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,800
What the hell
is goir on anyway?

765
01:15:12,713 --> 01:15:15,738
- Watch yourself!
- They're all gonna blow!

766
01:15:25,224 --> 01:15:27,054
Attention all civilians,

767
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:29,852
For your own safety,

768
01:15:29,728 --> 01:15:32,457
please evacuate
the streets immediately.

769
01:15:33,732 --> 01:15:36,734
Remain indoors until you receive
further instructions.

770
01:15:36,734 --> 01:15:42,365
I repeat, this is a police emergency.
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

771
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,950
We found Rambo's body.

772
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:08,422
As a matter of fact, it stole
an Army truck, blew up a gas station,

773
01:16:10,264 --> 01:16:11,389
The kid is resilient,

774
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:14,768
Forget what you're thinkir
and clear out while you can.

775
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:17,760
Get the fuck outta here.
Take your advice with you.

776
01:16:19,272 --> 01:16:22,502
When I talked to you earlier, you knew
he was still alive, didn't you?

777
01:16:25,278 --> 01:16:27,837
- I suspected.
- Yeah, sure,

778
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,078
That's why you stuck around,
You trained him.

779
01:16:31,784 --> 01:16:34,445
You taught him how to get out of places
like that cave,

780
01:16:34,787 --> 01:16:36,651
But he's not gonna
get out of this place,

781
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:40,291
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before,

782
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,053
What makes you think
you can handle him now?

783
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:45,761
Because God knows what damage
he's perpared to do.

784
01:16:57,307 --> 01:16:58,432
You're gonna die, Teasle.

785
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:01,002
Everybody dies,

786
01:17:02,311 --> 01:17:04,835
There's only one man in this room
that's got half a chance,

787
01:17:04,814 --> 01:17:06,371
That's not because
I'm better than he is.

788
01:17:06,816 --> 01:17:08,510
It's because he trusts me.

789
01:17:08,817 --> 01:17:10,841
See, I' m the closest thing
to family he has left.

790
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:13,548
That may be all the edge
I need.

791
01:17:13,321 --> 01:17:16,016
Jesus Christ,
where do you people come from?

792
01:17:21,328 --> 01:17:24,091
No, No, this is my job,
Trautman, This is my town,

793
01:17:24,331 --> 01:17:27,822
I'm not giving it up to you
or to Rambo or to anybody else.

794
01:17:28,335 --> 01:17:30,495
Now, you just stay
the hell out of my way.

795
01:17:40,846 --> 01:17:44,372
- Get a little closer!
- I can't! It's too goddamn hot!

796
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:48,648
Will, this is Lester.
Do you copy? Dver,

797
01:17:50,354 --> 01:17:51,752
Come on, let's go!

798
01:17:52,356 --> 01:17:54,084
Will, this is Lester.
Do you copy? Dver,

799
01:17:54,859 --> 01:17:57,861
Listen, Will, we got
some serious problems.

800
01:17:57,862 --> 01:18:02,127
The highway's been cut off. The truck's
out here, but we couldn't find the body.

801
01:18:01,865 --> 01:18:04,992
I repeat, no body.
It's totally burned out.

802
01:18:05,869 --> 01:18:07,529
Preston, get those
people outta here!

803
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:08,097
Hey!

804
01:18:08,371 --> 01:18:09,769
Move 'em back
to the south side.

805
01:18:09,873 --> 01:18:10,634
Move back! Move back!

806
01:18:10,873 --> 01:18:12,703
Listen, Will
we don't know how many...

807
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,808
gasoline reservoirs there are
under those gas pumps.

808
01:18:20,382 --> 01:18:22,713
- Do you copy? Over.
- We got a reporter here.

809
01:18:23,384 --> 01:18:25,510
Preston, push them back!
I don't care who he is!

810
01:18:30,391 --> 01:18:32,654
Move them around!
Get the trucks to the other side!

811
01:18:32,893 --> 01:18:34,325
Come on!
Let's go!

812
01:18:34,394 --> 01:18:36,156
Will, do you copy?
Over.

813
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:31,816
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!

814
01:24:08,696 --> 01:24:11,528
Go ahead,
Go ahead,

815
01:24:12,199 --> 01:24:14,257
Go ahead, you crazy
son of a bitch! Finish!

816
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:14,962
Rambo!

817
01:24:16,036 --> 01:24:17,559
Rambo, don't do it!

818
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,064
Listen to me, Rambo.
You have no chance.

819
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:24,565
So drop your weapon.

820
01:24:26,045 --> 01:24:28,808
I'm gonna order the chopper in
to fly you back to Bragg,

821
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,175
Hold your fire!

822
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:35,643
Kern!

823
01:24:37,055 --> 01:24:38,043
Hold your fire,

824
01:24:38,556 --> 01:24:41,023
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire!

825
01:24:41,059 --> 01:24:42,423
Think about
what you're doing,

826
01:24:44,561 --> 01:24:47,654
The building's perimeter
is covered, No exits.

827
01:24:48,065 --> 01:24:50,828
There are nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s.

828
01:24:52,069 --> 01:24:54,263
You did everything to make
this private war happen.

829
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:56,935
You've done enough damage!

830
01:24:57,573 --> 01:25:00,040
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?

831
01:25:01,577 --> 01:25:03,237
This mission is over!

832
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:07,547
Look at 'em out there,

833
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:11,847
Look at 'em!

834
01:25:15,089 --> 01:25:17,215
If you don't end this now,
they're gonna kill you,

835
01:25:18,092 --> 01:25:19,683
Is that what you want?

836
01:25:23,097 --> 01:25:24,723
It's over, Johnny,

837
01:25:25,098 --> 01:25:28,726
- It 's over!
- Nothing is over! Nothing!

838
01:25:29,102 --> 01:25:31,092
You just don't turn it off!

839
01:25:31,604 --> 01:25:33,070
It wasrt my war!

840
01:25:33,606 --> 01:25:35,630
You asked me,
I didn't ask you!

841
01:25:35,607 --> 01:25:37,108
And I did what
I had to do to win!

842
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:38,735
But somebody wouldn't let us win!

843
01:25:39,111 --> 01:25:40,839
Then I come back to the world,

844
01:25:41,113 --> 01:25:43,114
and I see all those maggots
at the airport.,,

845
01:25:43,115 --> 01:25:47,517
protestir me, spittir, callir me
' Baby Killer' and all kinds of vile crap!

846
01:25:48,619 --> 01:25:50,347
Who are they
to protest me, huh?

847
01:25:51,122 --> 01:25:54,852
Who are they, unless they've been me and
been there and know what they're yelling about!

848
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:58,423
It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo.
It's all in the past now,

849
01:25:58,128 --> 01:26:01,221
For you! For me,
civilian life is nothing!

850
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:03,257
In the field,
we had a code of honor:

851
01:26:03,633 --> 01:26:05,497
You watch my back,
I watch yours,

852
01:26:05,634 --> 01:26:08,761
- Back here there's nothing!
- You're the last of an elite group.

853
01:26:09,638 --> 01:26:10,763
Don't end it like this.

854
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:13,869
Back there I could fly a gunship,
I could drive a tank,

855
01:26:14,143 --> 01:26:15,871
I was in charge of
million-dollar equipment!

856
01:26:16,144 --> 01:26:18,941
Back here I can't even
hold a job parking cars!

857
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:23,878
Fuck it. Dh.

858
01:26:25,153 --> 01:26:27,347
Geez,
Oh, God.

859
01:26:29,156 --> 01:26:30,918
Where is everybody?

860
01:26:31,658 --> 01:26:32,988
Oh, God.

861
01:26:36,162 --> 01:26:39,289
I had a friend,
it was Danforth.

862
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:42,360
I had all these guys, man.

863
01:26:42,668 --> 01:26:46,159
Back there I had all these flaky guys
who were my friends.

864
01:26:47,172 --> 01:26:49,196
Back here there's nothing.

865
01:26:49,174 --> 01:26:50,697
Remember Danforth?

866
01:26:52,177 --> 01:26:56,203
He wore this black headband. I took
one of his magic markers and it said,

867
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,671
"If found. Mail us to Las Vegas"
'cause we were always talkirs about Vegas.

868
01:26:59,683 --> 01:27:03,118
And his fuckir car,
this red '58 Chevy convertible.

869
01:27:03,187 --> 01:27:06,917
He was talkir about this car. He said
we were gonna cruise 'til the tires fall off,

870
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:20,260
We go in this bar in Saigon, and this kid
comes up carrying a shoe shine box.

871
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:23,329
And he says,
"Shine, please, Shine,'

872
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,901
I said no. He kept askir,
and Joey said yeah,

873
01:27:27,209 --> 01:27:29,802
And I went to get
a couple beers,

874
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:33,509
And the box is wired,
And he opened up the box.

875
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,647
Fuckir blew his body
all over the place,

876
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:37,683
And he's layir there,
He's fuckir screamir,

877
01:27:38,218 --> 01:27:41,584
There's pieces of him all over me,
Just, ., like this.

878
01:27:41,721 --> 01:27:45,281
And I'm tryir to pull him off,
my friend that's all over me!

879
01:27:45,725 --> 01:27:48,591
I've got blood and everything.
I'm tryir to hold him together.

880
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:51,524
I'm puttir the guy's fuckir insides
keep comir out!

881
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:54,630
And nobody would help!
Nobody would help!

882
01:27:55,234 --> 01:27:57,235
He's sayir, " I wanna go home,
I wanna go home."

883
01:27:57,236 --> 01:28:00,671
He keeps callir my name. "I wanna go home,
Johnny. I wanna drive my Chevy."

884
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:04,002
I said, ' Why I can't
find your fuckir legs.

885
01:28:04,742 --> 01:28:06,504
I can't find your legs,'

886
01:28:08,246 --> 01:28:09,940
I can't get it
out of my head,

887
01:28:10,747 --> 01:28:12,475
I dream it seven years.

888
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,944
Every day I have this,

889
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:17,150
Sometimes I wake up,
I don't know where I am,

890
01:28:18,755 --> 01:28:20,244
I don't talk to anybody.

891
01:28:21,757 --> 01:28:23,223
Sometimes a day,

892
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,193
sometimes a week.

893
01:28:28,364 --> 01:28:30,228
I can't put it
out of my mind,

894
01:28:36,388 --> 01:28:37,479
Fuck it,

895
01:29:42,947 --> 01:29:46,609
It's a long road

896
01:29:47,452 --> 01:29:50,318
When you're on your own

897
01:29:51,456 --> 01:29:53,889
And it hurts when

898
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,984
They tear your dreams apart

899
01:29:58,962 --> 01:30:02,727
And every new town

900
01:30:02,965 --> 01:30:06,559
Just seems to bring you down

901
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:11,730
Trying to find peace of mind

902
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:14,697
Can break your heart

903
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:18,873
It's a real war

904
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:22,239
Right outside your front door

905
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,149
I tell ya

906
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,915
Out where they'll kill ya

907
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:31,156
You could use a friend

908
01:30:32,192 --> 01:30:35,524
Where the road is

909
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:39,220
That's the place for me

910
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:43,725
Where I'm me in my own space

911
01:30:44,202 --> 01:30:47,659
Where I'm free. That's the place

912
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:50,730
I wanna be

913
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:56,805
'Cause the road is long, yeah

914
01:30:57,715 --> 01:31:01,150
Each step is only the beginning

915
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:04,812
No breaks, just heartaches

916
01:31:05,221 --> 01:31:09,748
Oh, man, is anybody winning

917
01:31:12,228 --> 01:31:15,663
It's a long road

918
01:31:16,231 --> 01:31:18,960
And it's hard as hell

919
01:31:20,235 --> 01:31:23,761
Tell me what do you do

920
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,798
To survive

921
01:31:27,742 --> 01:31:31,302
When they draw first blood

922
01:31:31,746 --> 01:31:35,181
That's just the start of it

923
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:40,048
Day and night, you gotta fight

924
01:31:40,754 --> 01:31:43,119
To keep alive

925
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:47,419
It's a real war

926
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,956
Right outside your front door

927
01:31:51,263 --> 01:31:52,559
I tell ya

928
01:31:53,265 --> 01:31:56,427
Out where they'll kill ya

929
01:31:56,768 --> 01:31:59,235
You could use a friend

930
01:32:02,273 --> 01:32:06,834
'Cause the road is long, yeah

931
01:32:07,778 --> 01:32:11,235
Each step is only the beginning

932
01:32:11,749 --> 01:32:14,842
No breaks, just heartaches

933
01:32:15,753 --> 01:32:20,189
Oh, man, is anybody winning

934
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,956
The road is long, yeah

935
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:31,357
Each step is only the beginning

936
01:32:31,767 --> 01:32:34,826
No breaks, just heartaches

937
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:40,571
Oh, man, is anybody winning

938
01:32:42,276 --> 01:32:45,711
