1
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:39,196
Here it is, trying to buy
the pot. Here he goes.

2
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:40,284
Buying the pot.

3
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,878
-He doesn't have enough to buy it.
-Buying the pot.

4
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,089
What do you got?

5
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,780
Let's see 'em.

6
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:50,407
-That's lucky.
-No he has.

7
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:51,944
That's a flush.

8
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,672
-He had a flush...
-You're lucky.

9
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,146
-It's called being The Champ.
-That's what it's called.

10
00:01:55,178 --> 00:02:00,046
I'll give you "The Champ". Take your
God damned money there, fuckin' punk.

11
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,858
Thank you very much! Fuck yeah.

12
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:07,959
Fuckin' stripper girls on me
tonight, boys.

13
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,177
It's gettin' cold, boys.

14
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:13,468
I could share some of this with
you gentlemen, if you'd like.

15
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:16,542
It is the first of November.

16
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:19,234
Well, look at this.

17
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:23,462
One month from today, I'll be sippin'
margaritas with the lady in Florida.

18
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:27,977
-Florida?
-Every year, baby. Christmas in Florida.

19
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,021
Margaritas?

20
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,550
Is that, Disney World or
Disney Land in Florida?

21
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:34,800
What was that, excuse me?

22
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:37,427
Is it Disney World or
Disney Land in Florida?

23
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,444
PPAh, fuck Disney World.

24
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:41,943
I'm there for the women, dude.
I'm a grown man.

25
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,737
The women and your girl?

26
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:45,562
Well...

27
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:50,271
That's what this money will
help me get, right?

28
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,327
Well

29
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,858
I like a white winter.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,965
So what's the deal, you staying
here again this year?

31
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:58,727
Yeah. Fuck.

32
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,624
I love it up here, you know.

33
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:02,123
You poor son of a bitch.

34
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:03,500
Stupid.

35
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,606
-Alright.
-I like the double pay, man.

36
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,298
I'll need it after this poker
game.

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,059
Double pay, right...

38
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,109
I wanna see this. C'mon, give
me something good here.

39
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:14,423
Let's see what we got here.

40
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:17,306
Here we go. Game on, bud.

41
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,055
<i>Jensen!</i>

42
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,352
<i>-Jensen, come in!
-Fuck me!</i>

43
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:46,582
<i>Chopper's comin' in.
We got company.</i>

44
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,656
<i>Outpost NTC-291,
this is DBA Transport.</i>

45
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:55,198
<i>Stand by for landing...</i>

46
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:08,933
Check. Check.

47
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:14,346
Fold.

48
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:15,690
Alright, everyone.
This is Professor Olsen.

49
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:19,791
Head of archaeology for U of T.
Head of field research for the SAA.

50
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:23,987
Professor, Francis Månro, project
director. Pleasure to meet you.

51
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:26,901
Likewise. I did a paper
on you in University.

52
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:31,931
That's Drew McNaughton, he's
our equipment technician.

53
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,757
And Robert Michael Giles,
field supervisor.

54
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:36,382
What he's doing here and not
on site is beyond me.

55
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,824
I'm on my break.

56
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:40,963
And that's, Dr. Richard Andervs,
site assigned medical supervisor.

57
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:41,957
-Pleasure to meet ya.
-Likewise.

58
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,813
Let me know if
you need anything,

59
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:47,401
It would be nice to do something
around here for a change.

60
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:51,789
Let me show you the lab.

61
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,815
-You want in here?
-Yeah.

62
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:57,459
Alrighty.

63
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,579
Do it up.

64
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:03,097
And this is Steven Welles, he's
here on a corporate internship

65
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:05,114
with a company in Calgary.

66
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:07,260
He's been my assistant for the
past few months.

67
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,214
-How's it going?
-Well, thank you.

68
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,648
You've got a very
impressive resume.

69
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,026
Thank you.

70
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:14,915
Professor Olsen is here to write a
report to hopefully get us a grant

71
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,324
from the SSHRC to get us more
funding and more hands.

72
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:20,361
Hey, that would be great. I really
look forward to working with you.

73
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:21,707
Likewise.

74
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:23,563
So, how was the trip in?

75
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,133
Long.

76
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah, it's a long ride on that chopper.
You're lucky, it's three times as long

77
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,650
if you were to ride
up during a storm.

78
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,026
Is it usually this cold out?

79
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,326
It's not usually this warm.

80
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:35,415
-Really?
-Yeah.

81
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,305
So I...

82
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:39,899
Bet you're wondering why they
sent you up to

83
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,423
a Northern Paleo Indian outpost.
Something like that, yeah.

84
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:45,377
I'm curious what they told you.

85
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,395
Unusual Clovis findings.

86
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:48,772
That's all?

87
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:50,534
They were pretty
vague with the details.

88
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:55,081
Yeah, we were pretty stingy
with the details ourselves.

89
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,811
It's pretty standard, right?

90
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:59,695
Yeah, I'd say. Standard Clovis
culture. Yeah.

91
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:03,058
The past three years we've stationed
here, that's all we've dug up.

92
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:06,100
11,000 B.C.E. Clovis.

93
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:10,041
It's pretty interesting stuff.
Nothing too exciting though.

94
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:10,808
Right.

95
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:15,518
Two weeks ago,
we found this pot.

96
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:18,367
11,000 B.C.E. Clovis pottery.

97
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,257
It's interesting, but not
impossible.

98
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,179
Yeah, that's not what's
interesting, though.

99
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:26,312
We found it under sediment
dated to 14,000 B.P.

100
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,681
14,000 B.P. Clovis pottery.

101
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,989
Nope, not Clovis.

102
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,429
Pre-Clovis pottery?

103
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:35,024
Mesoamerican.

104
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,850
I mean, it looks Mesoamerican.

105
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,676
It's got similar
symbols and markings.

106
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:43,385
We're over 4,000 miles from the
nearest Mesoamerican site.

107
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:46,427
There's one hundred different
reasons for this being here.

108
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,118
Early trade activity in this
area,

109
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,129
ceremonial burial of a more recent
culture. Something like that.

110
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:55,075
Right, but 14,000 B.P.?

111
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:58,630
Well, you know that radio-carbon
dating's not always accurate.

112
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:00,457
Right...

113
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:04,235
We've also started unearthing a
structure.

114
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,421
A structure?

115
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:09,233
A week ago, we began unearthing
a large object that we think

116
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,763
is the roof of a structure that
goes down...

117
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,973
Well, really far.

118
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:14,934
How far?

119
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:16,439
Maybe a meter. Maybe ten meters.
We don't know.

120
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:20,507
We don't want to jump to any conclusions
here. I mean, it could be nothing.

121
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,589
It could be planted...
We don't know.

122
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,062
Right. But...

123
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:27,201
If this is the real deal, then we're
looking at one of the biggest finds

124
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:31,141
in the past century. We are right in
the middle of the ice-free corridor

125
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:35,755
and this could confirm that
theory.

126
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:45,619
Over the past three years we've covered
over two square kilometers of ground.

127
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:51,162
Going as deep as
12,000 B.P. of sediment.

128
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,756
Have a good night.

129
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:55,517
Any of them speak English?

130
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:56,925
All of 'em.

131
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,584
They speak Dogrib with one another,
but they're all fluent in English.

132
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:02,468
Any of them have experience
with Archaeology?

133
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,846
Not one of 'em.

134
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,990
No, they're all from a reserve about
a hundred miles south of here.

135
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:10,701
We just pay the, band council
and they give us workers.

136
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,824
Usually finish this early?

137
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:17,651
We don't get much sunlight up
here.

138
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,437
And when the sun isn't
up, it hits fifty below.

139
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,622
Sun goes down real fast.

140
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:24,025
Yeah, get stuck out here for
long and your blood will freeze.

141
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:28,220
I wouldn't want to be the poor son of
a bitch to have to experience that.

142
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:32,032
Okay, gentlemen. Thank you
again.

143
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,729
How many hours of sunlight do
you get?

144
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,683
What, this time of year?
I don't no.

145
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:36,997
Like five... Five and a half.

146
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,840
You know, we try to use as we can
but come December and January

147
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:45,004
we barely get any at all.

148
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:48,175
So, what do you do with the
other nineteen hours?

149
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:52,373
Drink, mostly.

150
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:03,871
Welles and Månro sleep there.

151
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,368
That's my office, and

152
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,546
there's the communication cabin.

153
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,020
That's where Jensen is.

154
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:14,249
And McNaughton and Giles, they have
their own cabins; They're over there.

155
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,637
And, this is us.

156
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:23,089
Home, sweet home.

157
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,672
That's me.

158
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:35,324
Ramis, the site chef; He sleeps
in there.

159
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:37,502
It's pretty small.

160
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,168
Cozy.

161
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,929
It's a shit hole.

162
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:43,076
You're upstairs, c'mon. I'll
show ya.

163
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,652
And, finally, your room.

164
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:55,152
Bed's kind of shitty, but it'll
do the trick.

165
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,682
That heater takes about an hour
to start to work, so...

166
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:00,276
Sometimes you gotta smack it
around a little.

167
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:01,655
You're gonna need blankets,
pillows...

168
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:05,177
There's a stack of that stuff in
laundry room; It's the next room over.

169
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,292
By the way, it gets kind of
loud.

170
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:09,662
-Wonderful.
-Yeah, it sounds shitty, but

171
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:13,024
there's a little vent there that siphons
hot air from the machines into this room

172
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:17,284
so it's actually not that shitty.
Believe me, in a couple of days

173
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:23,019
you're gonna be thankful we
gave you this room.

174
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,573
Enjoy.

175
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,245
Hey, puss.

176
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:57,164
Gibson, get off the table.

177
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:58,091
Gibson!

178
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:02,128
Okay.

179
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,801
Beat it.

180
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:05,874
-Bye, puss.
-We're out of eggs.

181
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:09,782
Alright... Anything else?

182
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:13,916
Yeah, we'll be out of milk soon.

183
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:18,335
Okay, I'll radio it in tomorrow.

184
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,758
How many more sites like this
are there?

185
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,633
There's a site like this, one
every hundred miles or so.

186
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:56,867
Two dozen spread across
the whole area.

187
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,263
Any of the other ones have
anything like this?

188
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:05,516
Not that we've heard of.
We're out of radio range.

189
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:09,137
I was reviewing some of the
photos last night.

190
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,315
If you look here, these

191
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:14,901
kind of look like
symbols of a Trecena.

192
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:17,976
It's a Mesoamerican
period of time.

193
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:21,179
It's similar, but it's faded

194
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:22,876
so it's hard to tell.

195
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:26,016
Maybe a simplified version.

196
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,387
Now, if you look over here,

197
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:31,814
that's nothing. It's just an
image. Maybe a hunting ritual?

198
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:37,803
Something like that.

199
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:40,142
How far down do
you think it goes?

200
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:41,231
No clue.

201
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:44,498
Based on the depth of
the bedrock in the area, I'd say

202
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:48,758
-three feet.
-Maybe as many as ten feet.

203
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:00,994
Outpost NTC-291 calling
Station-9, over.

204
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:13,614
Outpost NTC-291, calling
Station-9, over.

205
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:17,009
<i>This is Station-9, what can we
do for you, 291? Over.</i>

206
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,962
Hey, how ya doin', Station-9?

207
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:23,640
When's the next supply
drop at this location? Over.

208
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:29,661
<i>Hold on a minute. Let me check
that for you, 291,</i>

209
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:31,680
<i>Sunday, November 10th.</i>

210
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:36,164
<i>In three days, 291. Over.</i>

211
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:38,405
Okay great.

212
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:40,551
Can you add...

213
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:43,145
Let's see. Hang on one
second here.

214
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:48,975
Milk, cigarettes, and eggs to
the list, please? Over.

215
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:53,876
<i>Sure can do, 291. Eggs,
milk and cigarettes. Over.</i>

216
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:59,546
Great, thanks a lot.
Over and out.

217
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:03,710
Hunker down with a
bottle of Whiskey and a

218
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:09,379
box of porn. Yeah, well
it's much deserved, anyway.

219
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,041
-To whiskey and porn.
-To whiskey and porn!

220
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:14,856
There it is. Cheers for that.

221
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:18,091
You know what,
while on the subject,

222
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:20,589
how about a toast,

223
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,767
-to the crew...
-Yep.

224
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,722
Who will be remembered...

225
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:27,316
For the greatest
archaeological find.

226
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:28,340
Yeah.

227
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,494
-Possibly ever.
-Alright.

228
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,615
I like the sound of that.

229
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:31,938
-Cheers!
-Gentlemen.

230
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,972
Cheers.

231
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:38,847
And you'll be remembered as the guy
who sat on his ass the whole time

232
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:40,993
it was happening.

233
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,498
I,

234
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,446
I'm okay with that.

235
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:49,513
So, what do you think, Doc?

236
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:51,372
What do I think about what?

237
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,485
About that temple out there?

238
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:54,830
What do I think?

239
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:58,515
Who gives a damn what I think? I'm
a doctor, not an archaeologist.

240
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,037
It doesn't get old, does it?

241
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:05,080
No.

242
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,065
Jesus Christ...

243
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:08,988
Olsen!

244
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,774
What do you think?

245
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,601
About the temple?

246
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:16,067
-It's probably not a temple.
-Whatever, you know... How,

247
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:17,635
how far do you
think it goes down?

248
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:21,609
Just based on experience...
If I was looking at a

249
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,067
similar structure, in the
Amazon, based on

250
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,975
shape, size, some of the
defining characteristics

251
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:32,531
I would put it about...
20,000 B.C.E.,

252
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:36,631
which is, well, not possible.

253
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,656
Well.

254
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:44,093
-You know what I think?
-Yeah, what do you think?

255
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,080
Aliens.

256
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:49,218
That's just...

257
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,294
Hey, hey. You laugh now, but
wait until we start pulling up

258
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:54,663
little green bodies.

259
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:58,060
You're a God damned idiot.

260
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,995
Where's the file on Alpha-226?

261
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:11,544
Alpha 200 to Alpha 250 is
listed under fifty-nine.

262
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,067
Well this one is labeled one
hundred.

263
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:19,199
Red files are one hundred, blue
files are two-hundred.

264
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,413
Fuck.

265
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,359
This is giving me a headache.

266
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:32,525
Why don't you
just call it a day?

267
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:37,329
Yeah, maybe I will.

268
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:53,089
<i>Come in, Jensen. Over.</i>

269
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,422
What's up, Giles?

270
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,984
<i>Can you come down to the site?</i>

271
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:05,709
<i>I think you better see this.</i>

272
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,110
Yeah, I'll, be right down.

273
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:08,816
Over.

274
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:17,592
What the hell?

275
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:18,680
What is that?

276
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:20,443
It's Ramis' cat.

277
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:25,375
Jesus Christ, who did this?

278
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:28,224
I don't no.

279
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,698
One of the workers?

280
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:33,029
Why would they do it?

281
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:36,586
This is fucked up.

282
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,330
McNaughton?

283
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,546
Yes.

284
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:48,308
Why would McNaughton
kill the cat?

285
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,929
I don't know.

286
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:56,059
-You saw this happen?
-Yeah.

287
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,064
Okay.

288
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,050
Okay.

289
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:06,278
I'll look into it.
You can go back to work.

290
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:15,983
This makes no sense.

291
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:23,575
Hey McNaughton, come in.

292
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:25,465
Yeah?

293
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:29,404
Did you kill Ramis' cat?

294
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,365
No.

295
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:32,415
Well then, who did?

296
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:35,329
I don't no.

297
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:40,102
Navaron just came into my office,
he said he saw you doin' it.

298
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:41,383
He saw me do it?

299
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:45,612
That's what he says.

300
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:48,783
Nope, I didn't do it.

301
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:52,498
You'll figure it out.
I believe in you, buddy.

302
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,380
Copy.

303
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:56,086
Okay...

304
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:10,820
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

305
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:16,873
Just get up here, McNaughton, I'll tell
you everything when you get here, okay?

306
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:23,343
Hey Doc, wake up. I need you
out here right now.

307
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,355
What the fuck is going on?

308
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:28,083
Jesus Christ.

309
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,300
What's going on?

310
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:31,799
Three of our guys are gone. The
other two went lookin' for 'em.

311
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,042
Three of the workers? Yeah.

312
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:38,717
Giles still here? Yeah.

313
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,870
What do you mean, gone?

314
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,888
I mean they're gone, what the
fuck do you think I mean?

315
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,323
Well, why, man? I have
no idea why! Guys, guys!

316
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:46,629
The workers are all gone.

317
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,360
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

318
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,891
-All but two.
-What about Giles?

319
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:51,787
Not Giles.

320
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,656
-You didn't hear 'em leave?
-No, I didn't.

321
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,147
There's some tracks from the
cabin, going to the reserve.

322
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,806
-There going back to the rez?
-I don't no, I guess so.

323
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:05,367
What? Walking? Apparently.

324
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:09,371
This is fucking great.

325
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:16,193
Three weeks before wrap, you
think they'll send more guys?

326
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:17,635
I doubt it.

327
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:21,287
Why would they leave in the middle
of the night when it's fifty below?

328
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:23,913
Maybe they got spooked.

329
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:24,940
Spooked?

330
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,950
I don't no. They believe in all
sorts of wacky shit.

331
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:29,679
Maybe something spooked 'em.

332
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,659
Yeah? Like what?

333
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:34,387
The cat?

334
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,238
Yeah. Maybe the cat.

335
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:38,967
You know, it's possible.

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,946
They are a pretty superstitious
people.

337
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,797
So, they see the dead cat,
freak out, and leave?

338
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,878
And then wait until the middle
of the night?

339
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:50,530
I don't no. Maybe it was the cat in
combination with something else.

340
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:54,983
You know, an animal sighting or something.
What do you mean, an animal sighting?

341
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:59,628
Animals have a lot of
significance in Dogrib mythology.

342
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:03,566
They can come in the form of
demons, gods, or whatever.

343
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:09,078
So these guys see a moose in
the camp and run for the hills?

344
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:12,152
Well, regardless, we can't
work without more guys.

345
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,202
I'm going to call it in.

346
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,540
Well, I wouldn't say no
to an early winter break.

347
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:29,576
Five months alone here is
more than enough.

348
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,787
What happened to
"can't say no..."

349
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,125
Jesus Christ!

350
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,918
What the hell is wrong with him?

351
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:40,946
-He's got no fever.
-What did you eat?

352
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:42,613
I don't no, the same
shit you guys ate.

353
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:48,155
Alright, let's get to my
office. Let's go look at ya.

354
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:55,553
Jesus Christ.

355
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:07,820
Come in Station-9. Over.

356
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:19,545
Station-9, come in. Over.

357
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:35,336
Station-9, come in. Over.

358
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:47,155
Station-9, are you there?
Come in, please. Over.

359
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,269
So, what's the word?
We goin' home? Or...

360
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,633
No, I couldn't get
a hold of anyone.

361
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:03,555
What the hell's all this?

362
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:06,405
Welles threw up.

363
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:07,942
Is he okay?

364
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:11,113
I think so.

365
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,868
So what do we do?

366
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:19,537
Go back to work until we can
get a hold of someone.

367
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:36,866
Alright. Keep those walkies
tuned to the worker's channel,

368
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:39,590
that's channel 3. And keep an
ear by the two-way.

369
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,689
If anyone calls, we'll be back
before dark, alright?

370
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,451
Yeah, yeah. If it's Station-9,
tell them to send an E-Vac.

371
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:46,892
Yeah, yeah. Look, I know
it sounds trivial, but

372
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:48,397
it's important. I don't
care if you have to

373
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:53,106
take those radios with you when you take
a shit. Just stay by them, alright?

374
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,924
Okay.

375
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:22,062
Still feel like shit?

376
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:23,983
Yeah.

377
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:27,186
And you've been feeling progressively
worse throughout the week?

378
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:30,133
Yeah.

379
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,472
Any conditions? Anything?

380
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:36,346
Not that I know about.

381
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:40,350
Alright. How've
you been sleeping?

382
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:40,800
I'm not.

383
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,359
Open your mouth.

384
00:25:54,348 --> 00:25:56,943
Okay.

385
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:58,864
My best bet is

386
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:01,331
you got a real bad flu.

387
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:02,644
How'd I get it?

388
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:06,712
Well, sometimes, someone has a
virus, but they have the antibodies

389
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:09,467
so they don't even realize
they're contagious. Right.

390
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:10,716
Then, they give it to someone
else

391
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:13,791
and they don't have the antibodies,
and then they get sick.

392
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:18,980
I'm going to give you some new pain killers,
and some Triazolam; It'll help you sleep.

393
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:19,621
Alright?

394
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:43,194
Think they went home?

395
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,949
Just doesn't make any sense.

396
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:49,569
I mean, they don't have any of their
stuff. They've got no supplies.

397
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:52,581
They're not gonna make it very
far. Not in this weather.

398
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,855
Fuck, it's cold.

399
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:55,558
Yeah.

400
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,350
What's wrong?

401
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:05,712
Has anyone else been up here?

402
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:06,898
Why?

403
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:14,682
What? We lost?

404
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:20,703
We're not.

405
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:23,969
But these tracks aren't
going to the reservation.

406
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:26,148
They're going in the
complete opposite direction.

407
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,288
No one's been out here as far
as I can tell.

408
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,644
These tracks are headed north.
Reservation's south.

409
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:38,513
Well if they're headed north,
they're definitely dead.

410
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:03,527
It's not in bad condition
considering it's 11,000 years old.

411
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,776
Yeah, well nothing comes up
here.

412
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,853
On top of that, it's all untouched;
Buried beneath snow and ice.

413
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,766
The reserve where the workers are
from, they don't come up here ever?

414
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,508
No, the town they all took off to is the
northern most town for hundreds of miles.

415
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:17,365
Really?
Yep.

416
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,767
We're the northern most outpost.

417
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,690
291 out of 291.

418
00:28:23,738 --> 00:28:25,853
Stop that.

419
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:32,420
Most northern outpost by about
ninety miles.

420
00:28:32,451 --> 00:28:34,181
So what comes up here, then?

421
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,558
Nothing.

422
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,999
So, why are we here?

423
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:41,292
Same reason 290 is there. And
250...

424
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:43,374
226, 215...

425
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,905
Some surveyor found some
scribble on a rock

426
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:48,627
and figured it was important
enough to waste years of

427
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:50,420
people's time and government
money.

428
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:52,696
Yeah, nothing comes up
this far north through

429
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:55,385
these mountains except for
the odd charter plane.

430
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:59,709
Even those stopped coming up here after
that one went down, fifty miles from here.

431
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:03,425
Engine failure, from the cold.

432
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:06,468
So what motivated them to build
a camp here?

433
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,678
Rock pile formations, the usual
stuff.

434
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:12,746
You can see the initial reports.
Jensen's got 'em in his office...

435
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,188
Stop that!

436
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:20,753
Same old stupid shit.

437
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:51,407
-You wanna pass me that can?
-This one? I guess it's

438
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:55,124
empty. We've got...
Three more cans back in

439
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:59,703
storage. How long can we go for?
I say we got supplies

440
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:03,162
for, two weeks. At the most.

441
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:07,903
Supply drop was supposed to
be three days ago? Yeah.

442
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:11,651
Fuck.

443
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:27,218
Okay.

444
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:31,638
We're on for now.

445
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:52,522
Just put it down there.

446
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:53,611
Is it on?

447
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,020
Yeah, okay? I told you,
this thing works fine.

448
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:57,486
I just wanna see.

449
00:30:57,518 --> 00:30:59,441
Test, test.

450
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:07,896
Turn the dial.

451
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:12,060
The dial?

452
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:15,039
Test, test.

453
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:22,919
Try ninety-eight.

454
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:29,134
Test, test.

455
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:30,991
See, it works.

456
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,250
They must have theirs turned
off.

457
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:36,788
Or they aren't there.

458
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:41,785
Maybe there's a storm on the
other side. Who knows?

459
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,861
Well, just rig a loop to
ninety-eight.

460
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:46,685
Okay?

461
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:13,336
Yeah, there are, stone piles like this,
one every couple of miles or so.

462
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:16,346
They're all about a mile from
my initial dig spot,

463
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:20,126
where we found most of the
Clovis points.

464
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,912
This means the Dogrib
knew about the temple?

465
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,929
Nope. That's likely
just a coincidence.

466
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:28,518
Stone piles like these are really
common among native cultures.

467
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,073
They're used to mark important
spots like,

468
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:35,277
ceremonial burial grounds
or recurring settlements.

469
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:38,512
Our theory is, that these were
used to mark a

470
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,785
hunting spot, for,

471
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:42,932
deer, or maybe bear.

472
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:43,924
A lot of bear in this area?

473
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,302
Yeah, but you don't have to
worry about that.

474
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,351
This place is covered in bear
traps,

475
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,370
and those will really fuck you
up.

476
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:50,908
Bear traps?

477
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:56,608
Yeah, put down in the thirties
by the Dogrib.

478
00:32:57,729 --> 00:32:59,940
These stones were put down
maybe, five,

479
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:01,862
six hundred years ago.

480
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:03,527
You see, the natives, they kept
a close eye on this spot

481
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,018
for a few thousand years,
along with some other

482
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:10,861
spots, that we haven't
started to excavate yet.

483
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:13,009
No markings... Nothing?

484
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,661
Just boring old stones.

485
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:20,695
Your specialty's Clovis.

486
00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:24,667
Yeah, since grad school.

487
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:28,735
Graduation year? '02.

488
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:32,899
You ever seen
anything like this?

489
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:37,032
I've never even heard
about anything like this.

490
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:37,736
Yeah.

491
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:43,757
You don't think we're,
we're trying to pull some sort

492
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,000
of elaborate hoax, do you?

493
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:47,376
Nah.

494
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:49,779
The radio-carbon dating
you had done on the

495
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:52,662
structure places it near
the end of the ice age.

496
00:33:52,695 --> 00:33:53,591
Yep.

497
00:33:53,623 --> 00:33:55,289
And it's a solid structure?

498
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,346
Right.

499
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:58,973
People didn't stay in one place
during the ice age.

500
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:01,150
Carbon dating of the artifacts
suggests that

501
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:04,161
these people were here for a
span of a few hundred years.

502
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:05,890
That's what doesn't make sense.

503
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:09,061
Maybe they found ways to adapt
to the cold.

504
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,408
Then why did they leave?

505
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:11,465
Where did they go?

506
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:14,346
South, to form early
Mesoamerica.

507
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:19,377
If they were going south, they
would have gone south.

508
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:54,610
For Christ sakes, would you cut
it out?

509
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:55,731
I'm bored.

510
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:59,029
Go to work. You're still on the
clock.

511
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,919
What clock? There's nothing to
do.

512
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:02,937
Why don't you try fixing that
radio?

513
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:05,628
You are the equipment
technician, aren't you?

514
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,344
That fucking radio is fine.
Everything on it works.

515
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:11,650
Except the part that lets us
talk to other people.

516
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:14,245
It's the ranger's station's
radio that's fucked, alright?

517
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:15,974
Nothing I can do here can fix
that.

518
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,800
Well if you aren't going to go
to work,

519
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:23,118
knock it off with that God
damned ball!

520
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,054
We're out of cream.
That's fine.

521
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:52,008
Look at this.

522
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,354
You see here?

523
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:57,998
That looks like a simplified version
of something you'd see on a.

524
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,983
Mayan or Aztec wall.

525
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,426
Really simplified.

526
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:02,804
Right.

527
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:04,469
What's strange is that, all of
these symbols

528
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:08,889
mean nothing in any Mesoamerican
system of writing.

529
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,436
Aesthetically, they look Mesoamerican,
but there's nothing here to suggest

530
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:15,391
that that is what this is.

531
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,665
I think that the similar
aestheric is

532
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,588
likely just coincidence.

533
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:21,189
So, what does it stem from?

534
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,271
Well, it doesn't look like
anything from South America,

535
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:25,000
so it's out of my expertise.

536
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:29,068
I do believe, however, that
what we're looking at is not a

537
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,945
writing system, but a
systematic series of drawings.

538
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:36,724
A lot of them are animals.
Maybe a hunting ritual?

539
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:40,054
Cave wall kind of stuff, but just
with more of a coherent style.

540
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:43,162
So, maybe a culture that was
here before the ice age.

541
00:36:43,193 --> 00:36:45,788
They built the structure
to survive in the cold,

542
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:48,927
but they didn't make it
to the end of the ice age

543
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:54,211
because of the cold.

544
00:38:03,206 --> 00:38:06,056
McNaughton, you in there?

545
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,804
McNaughton?

546
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:14,608
I'm coming in, okay?

547
00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:21,431
Hey.

548
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:26,107
Why didn't you answer the door?

549
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,095
Sorry...

550
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:29,856
I was just...

551
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,162
Reading.

552
00:38:32,194 --> 00:38:34,629
Right.

553
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,866
We saved you some lunch. You missed
breakfast, too. Are you okay?

554
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:43,019
I'm fine.

555
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:47,728
You... Need me to get you
anything? Something to drink?

556
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,004
I'm fine.

557
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:53,014
Okay.

558
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:55,864
Your lunch is in the kitchen.

559
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:11,719
<i>-Jensen, come in. Jensen.
-Yeah.</i>

560
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:14,763
<i>Meet me at my office,
I heard screaming.</i>

561
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:15,939
<i>-I think it's Welles.
-What?</i>

562
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,228
<i>Alright, yeah.
I'll be right there.</i>

563
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,881
<i>What? Alright, yeah.
I'll be right there.</i>

564
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,540
What's going on?

565
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,821
Doc heard screaming.

566
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:37,247
He went to go check on Welles.

567
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,074
And? Is he alright?

568
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:43,399
I don't no, it's fucked up.

569
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:47,050
Help me find it! Just look!

570
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:48,203
It's okay, Welles, it's okay.

571
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:51,246
Help me hold him down! What the
fuck are you waiting for?

572
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:54,512
Jesus! It's right here!

573
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:57,811
-What the hell!?
-Hold him down!

574
00:39:57,844 --> 00:40:02,361
It's moving up his God damned arm!
What the fuck are you waiting for!?

575
00:40:02,391 --> 00:40:04,026
Hold him down! Hold him down!
Shit.

576
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:05,371
Holy fuck!

577
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,221
-What do you... What do you want me to do?!
-Do something!

578
00:40:08,254 --> 00:40:10,144
-The fuck is that!?
-Cut it off!

579
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,897
-Cut it off!
-Yeah.

580
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:14,307
The fuck is going on here!?

581
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:14,803
No! No!

582
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:16,197
-Hold him down!
-No!

583
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:18,471
-Giles, hold him down!
-Take it easy, kid.

584
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,393
-Hold him. Hold him!
-Easy kid.

585
00:40:20,424 --> 00:40:22,539
Olsen! Olsen what
the fuck are you...

586
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:25,807
Clear!

587
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,163
-What the fuck is that, man!?
-Okay, deep breaths.

588
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,989
Deep breaths.

589
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:34,037
-Hold on, kid. Hold on.
-What are you doing?

590
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:37,722
-Get the fucking morphine.
-Deep breaths.

591
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:40,284
Hang on kid. Almost there.

592
00:40:40,316 --> 00:40:42,110
Almost there.

593
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:46,562
Almost there. Almost there.

594
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:54,026
Fuck!

595
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:58,863
Fuck.

596
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,170
Anyone ever been sick like this
before?

597
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,955
Yeah, all the time. I'm serious.

598
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,365
You puttin' this in your report?

599
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,127
I'm putting everything in the
report.

600
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,953
Woah. This has nothing to do
with the site.

601
00:42:16,985 --> 00:42:20,444
The report's not just about the
site. It's about the entire camp.

602
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:21,918
Look. Professor.

603
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:23,711
We brought you up here to check on
that structure, and get us more money.

604
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:25,761
You want more money, you have
to address the issues.

605
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,652
Issues? What issues? The guy's sick. It
has nothing to do with the operation.

606
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:30,437
You weren't properly equipped
to deal with the situation.

607
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:32,231
That's bull shit.

608
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:34,185
We cauterized his arm with a
fucking shovel.

609
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:36,780
Yeah, well we weren't exactly
anticipating a God damned amputation.

610
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:38,349
You're ill-equipped.
You know what, fine.

611
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:43,731
Do your report. Maybe we can use the grant
money to buy a fucking Cat-Scan machine.

612
00:43:17,618 --> 00:43:22,872
Francis...

613
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:42,250
Do you see it?

614
00:45:22,698 --> 00:45:25,903
Woah. Jesus fucking Christ.

615
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:27,951
What... Jesus Christ.

616
00:45:27,984 --> 00:45:29,296
McNaughton...

617
00:45:32,051 --> 00:45:34,742
Anyone, come in, come in,
anyone!

618
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,569
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

619
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:37,593
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

620
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:39,740
-McNaughton's lost it!
-McNaughton's lost it!

621
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:44,192
Come in, we're in the lodging cabin,
he cut off his fucking hand, get Doc!

622
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:46,209
He cut off his fucking hand,
get Doc!

623
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,213
I'm on my way, over. Okay, bud. Just
calm down. What's up? What's happening?

624
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:54,345
It's going to be okay, Doc's on his
way, okay? Just relax, McNaughton.

625
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:58,606
Dude,
what the fuck is...

626
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:02,544
Grab him! Hold him down. Holy
shit!

627
00:46:02,577 --> 00:46:04,980
Hold him down! What happened?
He cut his arm off!

628
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,741
What's wrong with him?!

629
00:46:06,773 --> 00:46:09,207
Help me hold him still.

630
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:11,162
Hold him still.

631
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:14,940
Tie it up!

632
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:19,458
Hurry!

633
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,077
C'mon, hold on, McNaughton.

634
00:46:32,943 --> 00:46:38,291
It's probably safe to assume you've
never heard of anything like this.

635
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:42,904
Is he gonna make it?

636
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:45,818
I don't want to sound
pessimistic, but I doubt it.

637
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,926
Not as long as he stays here.

638
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:49,983
And McNaughton?

639
00:46:50,013 --> 00:46:53,794
I've got him on an
anti-psychotic.

640
00:46:53,825 --> 00:46:55,299
Did it work?

641
00:46:55,331 --> 00:46:59,144
We'll see. I'll keep a close eye on him
until we can get him out of here, but...

642
00:46:59,174 --> 00:47:01,161
He's probably going to lose the
rest of that arm.

643
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:05,069
He made a real gnarly mess out
of it.

644
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:05,582
Christ.

645
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:12,366
Good.

646
00:48:18,675 --> 00:48:19,348
This way.

647
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:32,033
Follow my voice.

648
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:40,040
Open your eyes.

649
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,133
Good.

650
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:48,945
I can see you, Jensen.

651
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,789
Any symptoms? Feeling sick?

652
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:11,621
Dizziness, headaches?

653
00:49:11,655 --> 00:49:15,947
No, no, I feel fine, I'm
just... Tired.

654
00:49:15,977 --> 00:49:17,932
Have you been sleeping?

655
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:20,014
Yeah, some. I,

656
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:23,378
I wake up and then I can't get
back to sleep.

657
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:25,459
How long's that been going on
for?

658
00:49:25,491 --> 00:49:28,343
A few weeks.

659
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:31,064
It's probably stress.

660
00:49:31,097 --> 00:49:35,261
You, have any heart palpitations?
Shortness of breath?

661
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:36,798
No.

662
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:39,008
Just waking up for no reason?

663
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,659
Yeah, pretty much.

664
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:46,919
I have been... Having this,
dream,

665
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:47,625
though.

666
00:49:53,518 --> 00:49:54,640
Well,

667
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:58,291
sometimes when you dream. The
body releases adrenaline.

668
00:49:58,322 --> 00:49:59,893
Wakes you up. Is it a nightmare?

669
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:04,953
No, it's not a nightmare, I mean, it's not
like I'm afraid, or anything like that.

670
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:11,455
What's the dream?

671
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:19,432
I see this... Person.

672
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:22,185
These people, I guess.

673
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:26,285
They're like us, but
they're not.

674
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:29,649
It's very strange...

675
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,703
I just feel like they're
watching me.

676
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:37,240
I don't know.

677
00:50:37,271 --> 00:50:41,820
Alright, well. I'll get you some sleeping
pills. They'll help reduce REM sleep.

678
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:46,464
You got any allergies? Heart
condition?

679
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:47,171
Okay.

680
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:56,074
All the artifacts were found within
thirty feet of the structure.

681
00:50:56,106 --> 00:50:59,020
They all have animals on
them being portrayed as

682
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:02,321
god-like creatures. That
much is fairly evident.

683
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:03,794
Right.

684
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:05,267
Based on the sheer amount of effort that
went into making all these artifacts,

685
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:09,206
and the structure, and the consistent
use of animal imagery on all of it,

686
00:51:09,237 --> 00:51:12,505
there's no question that this site
was extremely important to them.

687
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:14,363
Probably a place of worship.
Right, like a shrine.

688
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:18,079
Right. Now, one recurring theme in
a lot of these pieces is the deer.

689
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,552
This deer god is very important
to them.

690
00:51:19,585 --> 00:51:26,279
Maybe a creator god, like a Kukulkan in
Mayan, or Ehecatl in Aztec religion.

691
00:51:26,311 --> 00:51:27,689
You alright?

692
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,874
Yeah, just thinking...

693
00:51:28,906 --> 00:51:33,294
Yeah, as for where they went
to... Look here.

694
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:36,977
A lot of early tribes and civilizations
were wiped out by disease.

695
00:51:37,008 --> 00:51:41,109
Obviously, they had no medicine back
then, and they had no understanding

696
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:44,569
of the concept of
germs and bacteria.

697
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:47,835
Now, this piece. This is our
youngest piece by...

698
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:50,525
about a hundred years, so far.

699
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:51,934
Now, if you look here,

700
00:51:51,966 --> 00:51:56,131
these resemble people but, what's
strange is that they're disfigured.

701
00:51:56,164 --> 00:51:59,655
In all the other pieces, their portrayal
of people is fairly accurate.

702
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:02,537
Standing up... Arms, legs,
heads...

703
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:04,844
But that's not the case in this
piece.

704
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,919
People are missing appendages.
They're slouched over.

705
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:11,057
I believe this
depicts an illness...

706
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,211
A plague.

707
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:16,567
As the ice melted, the bacteria
could have been unfrozen.

708
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:22,077
I mean, the time line of our pieces
ends near the end of the ice age.

709
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:24,158
It's just a theory.

710
00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:26,431
So it wasn't the cold that
killed them,

711
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:28,770
it was the cold
protecting them, in a way.

712
00:52:28,803 --> 00:52:30,404
Exactly.

713
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:31,429
So everyone dies,

714
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:34,889
then no one comes through
for thousands of years,

715
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,669
letting the thing get buried
beneath sediment and ice.

716
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:43,729
Interesting. Well, it's interesting,
but it's not what I'm worried about.

717
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,156
What are you worried about?
I'm worried about Welles.

718
00:52:47,188 --> 00:52:51,865
Welles. You think what he has is
what this artifact is showing?

719
00:52:51,897 --> 00:52:55,067
It's happened before.
The Curse of the Pharaohs.

720
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:58,270
So, we're looking at a bacteria that's
ten to eleven thousand years old.

721
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:04,582
Yeah, frozen, deep in the ice along with
that structure and these artifacts.

722
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:31,294
Someone was sneaking around
the outpost last night.

723
00:53:31,327 --> 00:53:32,448
Who?

724
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,761
You tell me.

725
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,043
I don't no, maybe it was an animal.

726
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:37,316
For Christ sake, that was no
animal.

727
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:39,430
It was speaking words, I heard
it outside my room!

728
00:53:39,462 --> 00:53:42,345
Look! I'm hearing things, we're
all hearing things. Okay?

729
00:53:42,377 --> 00:53:43,402
But there's no one out there.

730
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:45,932
We're in the middle of nowhere.
This is just stress.

731
00:53:45,964 --> 00:53:47,535
It's not stress!

732
00:53:47,566 --> 00:53:49,686
There was someone
outside my fucking window,

733
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:51,569
speaking fucking
words to someone else!

734
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:53,203
What are you suggesting?
It's one of the crew?

735
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:55,574
I'm suggesting,
someone in our crew is

736
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:58,392
sneaking around, snatching
up all our supplies

737
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:01,403
and is going to leave us with
nothing, and then we're fucked!

738
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:02,493
-That's insane.
-Is it?

739
00:54:02,523 --> 00:54:03,741
-Yes.
-Is it insane?

740
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:04,350
Yes!

741
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:06,400
Is McNaughton slicing up his
arm insane?

742
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:09,955
Is all our workers waking up
one day and deciding to walk

743
00:54:09,988 --> 00:54:12,774
one hundred miles in the arctic
winter insane?

744
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:15,466
Just look into it!

745
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:44,484
<i>Look.</i>

746
00:54:44,517 --> 00:54:48,649
<i>As hard as you can.</i>

747
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:53,805
<i>Don't look at the trees,</i>

748
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:56,369
<i>or the mountains...</i>

749
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,130
<i>Look past them.</i>

750
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:09,821
<i>Look.</i>

751
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:37,400
I just found him
here like this...

752
00:55:43,068 --> 00:55:47,200
He must have untied himself
and taken my rifle.

753
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:52,549
Well, that's just wonderful.

754
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,561
Did he have a family?

755
00:55:55,592 --> 00:55:57,611
Ex-wife and a kid.

756
00:55:57,643 --> 00:55:59,308
Yeah, divorced though.

757
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,750
Still...

758
00:56:03,536 --> 00:56:04,978
Do an autopsy.

759
00:56:05,009 --> 00:56:08,758
See if you can find out what
was wrong with him.

760
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:21,729
Any word on a rescue?

761
00:56:21,762 --> 00:56:24,421
Not yet...

762
00:56:40,018 --> 00:56:42,549
Wash your hands.

763
00:56:42,581 --> 00:56:47,835
I think I'll take a shower.

764
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:56,066
Are you gonna watch me cut him
open?

765
00:56:56,098 --> 00:56:58,180
No, thanks.

766
00:56:58,212 --> 00:56:58,886
Fuck...

767
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:23,772
I ran some tests on the tumors
that were forming under his skin.

768
00:57:23,804 --> 00:57:25,919
The cells aren't human.

769
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:26,977
What are they?

770
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:32,806
They bare similarity to the
cells of a cephalopod.

771
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:34,376
An octopus.

772
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:37,226
There were traces of human cells, but they
were weird in the sense that they were

773
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:39,307
in the process of changing...

774
00:57:39,339 --> 00:57:40,397
Into what?

775
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:41,773
Into the octopus like cells...
Or squid or whatever.

776
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:46,322
You're trying to tell us that Welles
was turning into an octopus...

777
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:48,213
Well, sort of.

778
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:49,654
The cell formations that were building
on his muscle tissue, they would...

779
00:57:49,686 --> 00:57:54,234
detach once they reached a certain
size. I ran some blood tests earlier,

780
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:57,949
and the invader cells were
present in his blood stream.

781
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:00,353
And more than likely in his
spine, too.

782
00:58:00,383 --> 00:58:02,401
Welles is turning into an
octopus...

783
00:58:02,434 --> 00:58:04,228
More like, thousands of tiny
little ones.

784
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,110
What the fuck does that mean? It means
that he's really God damned sick.

785
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:09,865
Okay? I can't dumb it down for
you more than that.

786
00:58:09,897 --> 00:58:11,115
Jesus.

787
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:12,396
Yeah.

788
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:13,709
It's not possible.

789
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:14,702
Really?

790
00:58:14,733 --> 00:58:16,879
-Tell me more, professor.
-Guys!

791
00:58:16,912 --> 00:58:18,961
Guys!

792
00:58:18,993 --> 00:58:21,619
What are we gonna do?

793
00:58:21,652 --> 00:58:23,639
Well, I've got him on
every antibiotic I have.

794
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:26,746
Hopefully, it can stop
the invader cells...

795
00:58:26,777 --> 00:58:27,515
Otherwise...

796
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,461
We have to get a fucking
aquarium.

797
00:58:30,493 --> 00:58:34,016
What about McNaughton?

798
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:37,220
I found the same bacteria in
McNaughton's blood stream and his spine.

799
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:40,807
Which leads me to believe that
this bacteria, it spreads like

800
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:44,811
tertiary syphilis. Okay? It starts
in the spine; It moves to the bones,

801
00:58:44,843 --> 00:58:47,501
the muscle tissue, the skin
and then eventually,

802
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:49,550
as in this case, the brain.

803
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,729
So, the bacteria drove him
insane?

804
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,067
Well, it's a bit of a stretch
to make that kind of diagnosis,

805
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,630
based on the fact that I've never
seen anything like this before.

806
00:58:56,661 --> 00:59:00,986
I mean, he could have had a mental
breakdown due to isolation sickness, or

807
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:04,638
a schizophrenic episode brought
on by stress, or the bacteria.

808
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,770
I mean, he was exhibiting signs of
schizophrenia. Sudden temper, depression...

809
00:59:08,802 --> 00:59:14,246
But I'd have to see his family's medical
history, and I can't access that from here.

810
00:59:14,278 --> 00:59:15,591
All right, so what do we do?

811
00:59:15,624 --> 00:59:18,571
We need to get Welles to a
hospital or he will die.

812
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:20,621
I can keep him pumped up with,
antibiotics.

813
00:59:20,653 --> 00:59:26,867
But, hopefully he can fight off
the side effects.

814
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:29,590
Is it... Contagious?

815
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:30,712
Probably.

816
00:59:30,743 --> 00:59:33,465
First thing tomorrow, I want
that structure re-buried,

817
00:59:33,497 --> 00:59:36,893
I want the artifacts quarantined,
I want the whole site sterilized.

818
00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:38,014
What?

819
00:59:38,046 --> 00:59:40,191
You can't re-open this site
until you've quarantined,

820
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:42,818
tested, and surveyed all
the wildlife in the area.

821
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,196
That'll take years.

822
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:47,014
You're already responsible for the
death of one, maybe two crew members.

823
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:49,480
You started excavating before
the site was deemed safe,

824
00:59:49,512 --> 00:59:51,178
and now you're dealing
with the consequences.

825
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,721
-To re-bury the site...
-We are dealing a

826
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,989
dangerous bacteria that
we know nothing about.

827
00:59:55,021 --> 00:59:57,648
What I saw come out of Welles's
arm...

828
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,571
I won't have you, or anyone
else subjected to.

829
00:59:59,603 --> 01:00:01,524
I'm not going to throw away
three years of work! Look, he's

830
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,671
right, okay? This is foreign to
anything I've ever seen before.

831
01:00:03,702 --> 01:00:07,449
We don't know what it can do.
We shouldn't fuck with it.

832
01:00:07,481 --> 01:00:13,183
This is fucking bull shit.

833
01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:40,410
<i>Francis...</i>

834
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:48,354
<i>Come here...</i>

835
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:39,633
<i>Did you see it?</i>

836
01:01:39,665 --> 01:01:42,452
I saw you.

837
01:01:42,483 --> 01:01:46,520
<i>What else did you see?</i>

838
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:50,203
Nothing.

839
01:01:50,236 --> 01:01:52,222
There was nothing there.

840
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:55,361
<i>They're talking about you.</i>

841
01:01:55,393 --> 01:01:58,116
Who?

842
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,647
<i>The others.</i>

843
01:02:00,678 --> 01:02:02,631
Why?

844
01:02:02,664 --> 01:02:08,590
<i>They think you're going mad.</i>

845
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:09,743
Am I?

846
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:14,164
<i>They think you've got it.</i>

847
01:02:17,014 --> 01:02:17,495
Do I?

848
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:29,794
<i>That's right...</i>

849
01:02:29,826 --> 01:02:33,670
<i>Good.</i>

850
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:58,717
Hey. You're up late.

851
01:03:01,343 --> 01:03:03,490
First thing tomorrow, we're going
to quarantine these artifacts,

852
01:03:03,522 --> 01:03:08,424
start a report so we can get the ball
rolling on re-opening this site.

853
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:13,195
Okay.

854
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,533
You okay?

855
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:17,711
Yeah.

856
01:03:17,744 --> 01:03:19,795
I mean, I've seen some
shit before, but...

857
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:21,267
Nothing like that...

858
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:25,015
This thing goes sour, I'm the one that
has to explain it to his parents.

859
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:36,290
<i>Kill him.</i>

860
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:40,390
If a rescue doesn't come
in the next few days, I

861
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:43,369
think a few of us should
go hike up to the reserve.

862
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,860
<i>-Do it.
-Sure.</i>

863
01:03:46,892 --> 01:03:48,398
<i>Kill him.</i>

864
01:03:48,428 --> 01:03:52,401
Weather's going to break
in the next few days.

865
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:56,950
I think it might be smart to
take advantage of that

866
01:03:56,981 --> 01:04:00,728
while we can.

867
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,242
Okay.

868
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:09,826
You need anything?

869
01:04:09,856 --> 01:04:12,485
No.

870
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:13,188
You sure?

871
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,467
Yeah.

872
01:04:19,498 --> 01:04:23,599
Alright.

873
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:38,864
Stop!

874
01:06:39,824 --> 01:06:46,937
I... Just stop!

875
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:48,761
Why?

876
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:50,010
He was in pain.

877
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:51,998
I put him out of his pain.

878
01:06:52,028 --> 01:06:53,214
He was in pain.

879
01:06:53,245 --> 01:06:55,841
His face, I've never
seen anything like it.

880
01:06:55,873 --> 01:06:59,460
-It was horrible.
-Just step back.

881
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:04,777
All the way to the wall.

882
01:07:04,808 --> 01:07:08,589
Step back! Just
stay the fuck back.

883
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:12,305
What did you do?
What the fuck did you do?

884
01:07:12,336 --> 01:07:14,129
He was in pain. He couldn't die.

885
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:17,910
He wanted me to kill him. I didn't
want to. But he wanted me to...

886
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:22,010
He made me do it. He made me do
it. So I cut his wrist,

887
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,309
but he didn't die, so I... I cut
his throat, but he kept screaming

888
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,422
so I thought if I take off his
head, and I kept hitting him...

889
01:07:27,454 --> 01:07:30,529
-Step back! He didn't die, man!
-He didn't die!

890
01:07:30,561 --> 01:07:32,035
-And I didn't know what to do!
-Stop!

891
01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:34,182
I kept trying and I tried to
stop his heart

892
01:07:34,214 --> 01:07:38,121
but it didn't stop. It didn't
stop! And it was horrible!

893
01:07:38,153 --> 01:07:41,677
I didn't know, it was why...
It was so horrible.

894
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:42,862
It was...

895
01:07:42,894 --> 01:07:46,160
It was... He made me
do it. I swear to God.

896
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:50,326
I swear to God, he made me...
He...

897
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:54,328
Jesus...

898
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,269
What the fuck is going on!?

899
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,318
I... I didn't... He...

900
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:04,193
I want to go home.

901
01:08:04,226 --> 01:08:07,621
I would like to go home.

902
01:08:14,572 --> 01:08:15,758
No, I told you, I want to go...

903
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:19,794
No, don't, no!

904
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:20,786
He made me do it.

905
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:23,572
Don't try anything, or
I'll fucking shoot you.

906
01:08:23,605 --> 01:08:25,526
Please.

907
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:27,288
I had no choice.

908
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:31,004
I'm going to be out in the room,
right here, so don't try anything!

909
01:08:31,036 --> 01:08:33,117
We'll let you out when the
rescue comes.

910
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:36,481
<i>No! Listen to me! I had no
choice!</i>

911
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:39,813
<i>Giles! He made me do it!</i>

912
01:08:39,844 --> 01:08:41,542
<i>Giles!</i>

913
01:08:41,574 --> 01:08:45,546
<i>Giles! Listen!</i>

914
01:08:45,578 --> 01:08:49,261
<i>Giles!</i>

915
01:08:57,621 --> 01:09:01,464
<i>You did a good thing.</i>

916
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:35,290
Your blood pressure's good.
Liver checks out,

917
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,300
kidneys are fine... Thyroid,
it's all fine.

918
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:42,240
<i>Hey Doc, come in.</i>

919
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,457
Go ahead.

920
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:44,898
<i>Yeah. Look, I'm down at the
supply shed, I just need a hand.</i>

921
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:50,568
<i>I gotta get a bunch of these boxes
inside. Can you, can you come down?</i>

922
01:09:50,599 --> 01:09:54,379
Copy.

923
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:56,815
I'll be right back.

924
01:10:26,154 --> 01:10:29,934
Who's there?

925
01:10:29,965 --> 01:10:31,408
Hello?

926
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:43,419
Olsen...

927
01:10:46,653 --> 01:10:47,262
Olsen...

928
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:54,885
McNaughton?

929
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:04,558
Onchocerca

930
01:11:04,591 --> 01:11:06,513
volvulus...

931
01:11:06,543 --> 01:11:12,375
It lays it's maggots,
in human skin,

932
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:14,937
which survive in the eyeball.

933
01:11:14,968 --> 01:11:16,473
Shut up!

934
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,141
It only lays

935
01:11:18,172 --> 01:11:21,695
it's eggs in humans.

936
01:11:21,726 --> 01:11:26,019
Why are you telling me this?

937
01:11:26,051 --> 01:11:30,471
Five million people a year

938
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:36,685
to propagate it's species...
Shut up!

939
01:11:36,717 --> 01:11:39,151
Such tiny,

940
01:11:39,184 --> 01:11:41,586
insignificant creatures...

941
01:11:57,248 --> 01:12:01,252
It was... Speaking to me... I...

942
01:12:01,285 --> 01:12:04,328
I swear, it was speaking...

943
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:09,165
It was saying something about maggots,
and it wouldn't stop, and I...

944
01:12:09,196 --> 01:12:13,200
I had to stop it. I...

945
01:12:17,876 --> 01:12:21,657
I stopped it.

946
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:25,341
When was the last time you
slept?

947
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:29,120
I'm not sure...

948
01:12:32,867 --> 01:12:37,064
You're hallucinating. No.

949
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:40,203
Maybe... I...

950
01:12:40,234 --> 01:12:44,046
I don't know. It's... It's...

951
01:12:44,077 --> 01:12:47,569
It seemed real.

952
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,389
I'm going to give you some sleeping
pills so you can get some rest.

953
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,181
Lack of sleep, it triggers
hallucinations.

954
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:56,154
It seemed so real. I'm going
to give you some Xanax, too.

955
01:12:56,186 --> 01:13:01,630
I want you to take these and
get some sleep.

956
01:13:01,663 --> 01:13:04,514
I'll take care of this...

957
01:13:19,535 --> 01:13:23,924
It seemed real...

958
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:47,339
I brought you some soup.

959
01:13:52,207 --> 01:13:58,006
We're gonna hike up, to the
reserve tomorrow, if...

960
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,208
What the hell happened to you?

961
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:03,097
Do you not see him?

962
01:14:05,147 --> 01:14:07,871
There's not much of that left,
so you just make it last.

963
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,792
Please tell me you see him.

964
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:11,425
You see him, right?

965
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:14,341
I don't. I don't see anything.
What should I see?

966
01:14:14,373 --> 01:14:16,903
He's here. Now.

967
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:17,991
Listening.

968
01:14:18,024 --> 01:14:21,835
Watching. He's watching me,
Jensen.

969
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:25,168
I can't move without him
watching me. I can't move!

970
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:26,384
Just calm down!

971
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:31,925
-Okay? It's alright.
-I can't do it anymore. He wants me to...

972
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:34,295
He made me do it.

973
01:14:34,327 --> 01:14:39,005
Okay, just tell me what you see.

974
01:14:39,036 --> 01:14:41,952
He's behind you.

975
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:55,564
What's he doing?

976
01:14:55,596 --> 01:14:57,551
Watching you.

977
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:05,495
Touching you.

978
01:15:08,216 --> 01:15:09,786
Watching me.

979
01:15:09,817 --> 01:15:11,996
He's angry with me. He's going
to do something. I don't...

980
01:15:12,027 --> 01:15:13,213
Who is he? A deer.

981
01:15:13,244 --> 01:15:16,607
He's a deer. It's...
I don't know!

982
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:19,299
Don't leave me.

983
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,893
This is all in your head.

984
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:24,520
I don't want it anymore.

985
01:15:24,552 --> 01:15:26,564
I'm going to see if Doc
has something for you, okay?

986
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,332
No.

987
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:32,463
Jensen, please.

988
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:35,026
Stay. Please. No.

989
01:15:35,057 --> 01:15:37,588
Jensen!

990
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:51,746
Come back!

991
01:15:51,778 --> 01:15:56,103
Jen, come back!

992
01:16:32,136 --> 01:16:34,378
Where are you going?

993
01:16:34,411 --> 01:16:36,011
I think we should
hike up to the rez.

994
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:38,094
The weather's gonna be
nice in the next few days.

995
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:41,106
Yeah, it looks like you already
thought about that.

996
01:16:41,136 --> 01:16:42,931
I was going to tell you guys.

997
01:16:42,962 --> 01:16:44,244
Really?

998
01:16:44,276 --> 01:16:46,871
Because it looks like you were
about to leave us here.

999
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:48,280
I was not going to leave you
guys.

1000
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,772
What? Were you just going to take
the rest of our food with you, too?

1001
01:16:51,803 --> 01:16:53,885
I'm not ditching you guys.

1002
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:56,416
Just making sure you got the
map and the flashlights?

1003
01:16:56,448 --> 01:16:57,698
You got the batteries there,
too? Hey!

1004
01:16:57,728 --> 01:17:00,355
There's other maps and
there's other flashlights,

1005
01:17:00,387 --> 01:17:02,404
and I'm not fucking
ditching you guys.

1006
01:17:02,437 --> 01:17:04,711
I know your type, Jensen.

1007
01:17:04,744 --> 01:17:06,090
Fucking sociopaths.

1008
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,581
Acting all respectable and altruistic
until your opportunity pops up,

1009
01:17:09,613 --> 01:17:14,770
to get ahead, and bam, there you are,
pushing the rest of us out of the way!

1010
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:16,691
Well guess what? What?

1011
01:17:16,722 --> 01:17:19,447
If I see you touching
any of our shit,

1012
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:20,760
I'm going to shoot you.

1013
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:21,817
And then I'm going to kill you.

1014
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:25,370
And I won't hesitate, and I
won't have no sympathy.

1015
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:27,869
Because people like
you got it coming.

1016
01:17:27,902 --> 01:17:30,336
People like you
have it long coming.

1017
01:17:30,367 --> 01:17:34,789
Don't think I don't
have my eyes on you.

1018
01:18:07,908 --> 01:18:10,119
Scared me.

1019
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:14,121
When was the last time you
slept?

1020
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:16,043
I don't no.

1021
01:18:16,076 --> 01:18:18,190
Yesterday?

1022
01:18:18,221 --> 01:18:19,887
The day before?

1023
01:18:19,918 --> 01:18:21,168
Okay, I'm taking over.

1024
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:21,648
Why?

1025
01:18:21,682 --> 01:18:23,635
So you can sleep.

1026
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:26,966
No, I'm fine.

1027
01:18:26,997 --> 01:18:28,535
Worry about yourself.

1028
01:18:28,567 --> 01:18:30,906
What, you don't trust me?

1029
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,283
Why should I?

1030
01:18:32,315 --> 01:18:33,405
What did I do?

1031
01:18:33,436 --> 01:18:36,672
What did McNaughton do?

1032
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:38,273
What'd he do?

1033
01:18:38,306 --> 01:18:40,419
You know it's going to be a long winter if
you're gonna spend it up here by yourself

1034
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,764
not trusting anyone.

1035
01:18:41,796 --> 01:18:45,064
Well, if that's what I have to do,
then that's what I have to do.

1036
01:18:48,746 --> 01:18:52,847
I brought you this.

1037
01:18:52,878 --> 01:18:55,474
I don't want it.

1038
01:18:55,505 --> 01:18:58,357
When was the last time you ate?

1039
01:18:58,388 --> 01:19:01,687
I don't no.

1040
01:19:01,719 --> 01:19:03,545
Eat it.

1041
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:04,730
No.

1042
01:19:04,762 --> 01:19:07,805
I can make my
own food, thank you.

1043
01:19:07,838 --> 01:19:09,984
It's not poison. Leave me alone.

1044
01:19:10,015 --> 01:19:11,488
Fucking hell, man.
It's freezing cold.

1045
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,140
You're not going to eat, you're not going
to sleep? You're going to die in here.

1046
01:19:15,172 --> 01:19:16,037
Then let me die!

1047
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:21,163
Worry about your fucking
selves, I'm fine.

1048
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,002
Giles!

1049
01:20:58,599 --> 01:21:02,124
Yeah.

1050
01:21:29,988 --> 01:21:32,167
Fuck!

1051
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,756
Mother fucker!

1052
01:22:09,612 --> 01:22:15,698
Jesus fucking Christ...

1053
01:22:15,729 --> 01:22:17,587
He's dead.

1054
01:22:21,527 --> 01:22:25,691
Doc's dead.

1055
01:22:30,976 --> 01:22:32,674
This is bad.

1056
01:22:32,704 --> 01:22:36,389
It's not that bad. No, you're
losing a lot of blood.

1057
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,856
There's probably some
internal bleeding.

1058
01:22:38,888 --> 01:22:40,553
Fuck. Fuck...

1059
01:22:40,585 --> 01:22:43,084
We need a doctor, I don't
know what I'm doing.

1060
01:22:43,114 --> 01:22:44,396
We've got to get to the reserve.

1061
01:22:44,428 --> 01:22:51,092
You can't go anywhere like this.

1062
01:22:51,122 --> 01:22:53,012
You gotta go.

1063
01:22:53,044 --> 01:22:55,191
I'll stay here.

1064
01:22:55,223 --> 01:22:56,825
You'll die.

1065
01:22:56,857 --> 01:22:59,836
I'll be fine.

1066
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:03,679
There's a... a trail, behind the
site.

1067
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:08,131
It goes all the way to the reserve.
It's about... Ninety miles.

1068
01:23:08,163 --> 01:23:14,088
If you, hurry, you can get
there in a day and a half, so...

1069
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,691
Okay.

1070
01:23:15,722 --> 01:23:17,644
Sun's coming up in
an hour and a half.

1071
01:23:17,645 --> 01:23:20,527
You'll be down the
mountain in, I don't know...

1072
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:21,937
Five. And,

1073
01:23:21,969 --> 01:23:26,676
it's going to be a
lot warmer then, so...

1074
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:30,201
There's a map... in my room.

1075
01:23:30,232 --> 01:23:32,378
I'll be sure to send help.

1076
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:33,083
Okay.

1077
01:23:59,605 --> 01:24:02,264
<i>Stop him.</i>

1078
01:24:02,296 --> 01:24:05,595
<i>Stop him.</i>

1079
01:24:05,627 --> 01:24:09,855
<i>Go. Stop him, Jensen.</i>

1080
01:25:38,227 --> 01:25:42,038
Fuck!

1081
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,590
You're not real!

1082
01:27:15,249 --> 01:27:17,491
What do you want from me?

1083
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:21,686
<i>When an animal looks
up at the night sky,</i>

1084
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:24,536
<i>what does it see?</i>

1085
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:29,790
<i>Thousands and thousands
of tiny points.</i>

1086
01:27:29,821 --> 01:27:33,474
<i>Then a man looks up at the same
points</i>

1087
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:37,445
<i>and sees millions of stars.</i>

1088
01:27:37,477 --> 01:27:40,456
<i>Galaxies, within which</i>

1089
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:44,844
<i>are billions of planets.</i>

1090
01:27:44,876 --> 01:27:47,823
<i>Do you want to know what I see?</i>

1091
01:27:50,545 --> 01:27:55,510
<i>Were you there,
when I created the stars?</i>

1092
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:57,400
No.

1093
01:27:57,431 --> 01:28:00,250
<i>Space?</i>

1094
01:28:00,282 --> 01:28:01,692
<i>Time?</i>

1095
01:28:01,725 --> 01:28:02,654
No!

1096
01:28:02,685 --> 01:28:07,137
<i>But still, you think you
deserve understanding.</i>

1097
01:28:07,169 --> 01:28:10,981
I've done nothing to you.
I'm leaving your home.

1098
01:28:11,013 --> 01:28:15,657
<i>You don't really think I'm
bound to that structure,</i>

1099
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:16,908
<i>do you?</i>

1100
01:28:18,091 --> 01:28:23,248
<i>Artificial carvings on a stone?</i>

1101
01:28:23,281 --> 01:28:28,470
<i>Certainly, you don't believe
that I can be omnipotent,</i>

1102
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:30,424
<i>omniscient</i>

1103
01:28:30,456 --> 01:28:32,795
<i>but not omnipresent.</i>

1104
01:28:32,826 --> 01:28:34,140
You're not God!

1105
01:28:34,171 --> 01:28:38,623
God isn't cruel. He doesn't
kill men like this!

1106
01:28:38,655 --> 01:28:40,514
<i>-No?
-No!</i>

1107
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:41,988
<i>Do you believe that?</i>

1108
01:28:42,018 --> 01:28:46,343
If you are God, tell me why!

1109
01:28:46,376 --> 01:28:48,201
Tell me!

1110
01:28:48,232 --> 01:28:50,219
<i>I have to go.</i>

1111
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:53,326
Why don't you stop me?

1112
01:28:53,357 --> 01:28:56,913
Because you're in my fucking
mind, that's why!

1113
01:28:56,945 --> 01:28:59,251
<i>Why don't you think I'm real?</i>

1114
01:28:59,283 --> 01:29:01,782
Because you're a
fucking parasite!

1115
01:29:01,813 --> 01:29:05,049
<i>I'm not here to teach you,</i>

1116
01:29:05,081 --> 01:29:07,483
<i>or to make you believe in me.</i>

1117
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:09,598
Then shut the fuck up.

1118
01:29:15,235 --> 01:29:18,086
I don't give a shit
what you want,

1119
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:19,367
where you came from,

1120
01:29:19,399 --> 01:29:22,345
or what you're fucking doing
here.

1121
01:29:26,798 --> 01:29:29,425
You can go fuck yourself,
asshole.

1122
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:41,083
Where are you!?

1123
01:29:45,824 --> 01:29:49,128
Tell me, God dammit!
