found their way there.

planting explosives on a ship's hull.

00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,955
Okay. You got me.

631
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,876
All you had to do was say something.

632
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,256
MAN ON TV: To recap our lead story,

633
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,842
a private jet carrying
an Algerian negotiating committee

634
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:21,179
was shot down this morning
as it left the airport in Madrid.

635
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,348
Seven passengers and two crewmen
were killed.

636
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,891
-What's up, skipper?
-Take a look at this.

637
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,393
Eyewitnesses report the plane exploded
less than a minute after takeoff.

638
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,896
Unconfirmed reports say
the weapon which downed the plane

639
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,650
was an American-built,
hand-held missile called the Stinger.

640
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,569
Two men believed responsible
for the attack were captured.

641
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,196
Spanish police say they have evidence

642
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,574
that more attacks on civilian aircraft
are planned.

643
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,459
Did you hear what happened?

644
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:56,589
Your defender of religious faith just blew
a peace commission out of the sky.

645
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,925
It's happening, Claire.

646
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,971
Help us. Give me some information.
Something. Anything!

647
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,973
Why can't you understand?

648
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:07,851
I don't create the news.
I report it. I'm a journalist.

649
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,144
-You're involved.
-I won't be an accomplice.

650
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,606
Well, who are you helping
by not giving me any information?

651
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,487
All right.

652
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:23,199
Write your story. And the next one.

653
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,535
And when the next plane is shot down,

654
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,789
make sure you get the names and ages
of the innocent victims right.

655
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,669
Okay.

656
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,715
But I can't volunteer anything.

657
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,469
You ask the questions
and I'll try and answer what I know.

658
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,139
All right.

659
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,660
I think I've got something.

660
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,829
Walid Fahladi.

661
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:13,666
Wasn't he with Shaheed's go-between
at the second meeting that you had in...

662
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,335
-Balbec. Right.
-Balbec. Yeah, that's right.

663
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,920
Right, right, right.
Now we're getting someplace.

664
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,089
Except he dropped out of sight
six months ago.

665
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,841
-What are you talking about?
-Disappeared.

666
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:25,011
Kidnapping, probably.
Could've been the Israelis.

667
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,473
Great.

668
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:32,644
Now, that is the best goddamn idea
I've heard all day.

669
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,898
-What?
-What you just said.

670
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,107
What did I just say?

671
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,275
Why don't we just go in there,

672
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,028
grab one of these cheese-dicks
and make them talk?

673
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,613
Sounds great.

674
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,867
I don't think
she's taking us that seriously.

675
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,452
What do you expect?

676
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,580
I don't think you understand the situation.

677
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:56,626
These guys are religious zealots.
There's no way you could make them talk.

678
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,378
You're dealing with extremists.

679
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,339
-And you're dealing with the Navy SEALs.
-Oh, okay.

680
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,926
(ALL CHATTERING)

681
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,641
All right. I've heard enough.
I've heard enough.

682
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,476
I can assure you that this administration

683
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,979
will take no part
in the kidnapping of a foreign national.

684
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,981
-МАN: Warren, hear him out.
-No.

685
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,067
I appreciate your zeal in this matter, Dick,
but it's totally out of the question.

686
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,486
Just a minute. We know this guy.

687
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,822
-You know him, Elliott?
-Yeah, he's a paid asset.

688
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,949
We've bought information from him
in the past.

689
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,534
I always thought he was a little fish.

690
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,370
If this guy has any information,
why hasn't he contacted you already?

691
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,206
He's probably scared shitless.

692
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,543
But if we extract him
and we make it look like a kidnapping,

693
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,462
I feel certain he'd sell us
anything he knows.

694
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,548
Look, can we call this a defection?
I'm thinking...

695
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,967
You can call it an immigration
if you want to, Jim.

696
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,429
The point is, you give the guy money,
he jumps into bed.

697
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,437
Warren, shall we continue to plan?

698
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,111
All right. I'll update the President.

699
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,576
All right. Let's go through it again.

700
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,621
It may be the last chance with this model,
so go over it again.

701
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,126
-Ramos.
-Street to south.

702
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,587
-Graham.
-Street to the north.

703
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,965
-Hawkins.
-Front door. First floor.

704
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,135
-Dane.
-Side wall. Second floor secure.

705
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,389
-Right. Rexer.
-Rear wall. Secure courtyard.

706
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,224
All right, for those people on the street,

707
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,393
if there's any trouble,
collapse on the house.

708
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,437
Those inside, stay inside.

709
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,023
We move out together, only together.

710
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,276
Remember, there's only one hostile,
a bodyguard,

711
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,737
so let's not hose down the place.

712
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,114
I'd be happy if no shots were fired.

713
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,908
So would he, I'm sure.

714
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,835
-I want you to keep right on top of him.
-I'm sure it'll be okay.

715
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,506
You're gonna be on Syrian
and Israeli radar the moment you take off.

716
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,674
So you have to stay
in commercial airspace

717
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,512
and jump from 12 miles offshore
and swim in.

718
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,430
Assuming everything goes okay,

719
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:17,600
the biggest thing to worry about
is the extraction.

720
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,602
You'll be extracting in a Ribex.

721
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,605
It'll be on radar the moment it starts in.

722
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,149
You only get one pass at it.

723
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:27,401
If you're not right there on time
to the second,

724
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,612
you're gonna have to walk home.

725
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,532
We'll be there, skipper.

726
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,075
Do the deed!

727
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,724
Two hours in.

728
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:02,103
Forty-five minutes
at the beach landing site.

729
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,523
If I'm a no-show, you're taking them in.

730
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,484
With pleasure. Just a walk in the park.

731
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:09,819
No, it isn't.

732
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,405
Just because
we aren't expecting resistance,

733
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,407
don't relax on this one.

734
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,874
How you doing?

735
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,502
I hate jumping out
of a perfectly good airplane.

736
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,754
You don't gotta love it,
you just gotta do it.

737
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:58,409
What's our altitude?

738
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:03,164
-What's our altitude?
-It's about 30,000. That's six miles up.

739
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,874
You guys are crazy.

740
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,294
That's right, and proud of it, baby.
