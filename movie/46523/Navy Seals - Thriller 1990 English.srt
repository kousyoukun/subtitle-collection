[MAN ON TV] To recap our lead story,

636
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,833
a private jet carrying
an Algerian negotiating committee

637
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,169
was shot down this morning
as it left the airport in Madrid.

638
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,345
Seven passengers and two crewmen
were killed.

639
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,951
- What's up, skipper?
- Take a look at this.

640
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,454
Eyewitnesses report the plane exploded
less than a minute after take off.

641
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,890
Unconfirmed reports say
the weapon which downed the plane

642
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,644
was an American-built,
hand-held missile called the Stinger.

643
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,567
Two men believed responsible
for the attack were captured.

644
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,190
Spanish police say they have evidence

645
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,568
that more attacks on civilian aircraft
are planned.

646

Did you hear what happened?

647
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:56,583
Your defender of religious faith just blew
a peace commission out of the sky.

648
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,915
It's happening, Claire.

Something. Anything!

- I won't be an accomplice.

by not giving me any information?

of the innocent victims right.

664

Wasn't he with Shaheed's go-between
at the second meeting that you had in...

665
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,395

- Disappeared.

669
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,008
Kidnapping, probably.
Could've been the Israelis.

670

Great.

671

These guys are religious zealots.
There's no way you could make them talk.

will take no part
in the kidnapping of a foreign national.

- [MAN] Warren, hear him out.
- No.

688
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,127
I appreciate your zeal in this matter,
Dick, but it's totally out of the question.

689
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,483
Just a minute. We know this guy.

690
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,811
- You know him, Elliott?
- Yeah, he's a paid asset.

691
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,943
We've bought information from him
in the past.

692
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,553
I always thought he was a little fish.

693
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,360
If this guy has any information,
why hasn't he contacted you already?

694
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,196
He's probably scared shit less.

695
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,533
But if we extract him
and we make it look like a kidnapping,

696
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,460
I feel certain he'd sell us
anything he knows.

Look, can we call this a defection?
I'm thinking...

You can call it an immigration
if you want to, Jim.

We move out together, only together.

Remember, there's only one hostile,
a bodyguard,

714
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,727
so let's not hose down the place.

You're gonna be on Syrian

and jump from 12 miles offshore
and swim in.

Assuming everything goes okay,

722
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,597
the biggest thing to worry about
is the extraction.

723

You'll be extracting in a Ribex.

It'll be on radar the moment it starts in.
