00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,115
Cap station changed to sector
Lima, 50 miles, Angels 320, over.

3
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,118
I'm outside, roger.

4
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:22,290
Mayday! Kuwaiti Star here!

5
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,084
Your bogey, 20 right, 35. Over.

6
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,882
No joy.
Keep bogey dope coming. Over.

7
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,761
Target 306, platform. State 5.0.

8
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,262
Target tanker, what's your posit?

9
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,765
This is tanker Kuwaiti Star.
Mayday!

10
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:42,268
Can anybody hear us? Please, answer!

11
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,395
- Sir.
- This is tanker Kuwaiti Star!

12
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,023
Kuwaiti Star, this is United
States warship Yankee Bravo.

13
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,274
What is your situation, over?

14
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,569
We have been attacked! Five wounded.
Please, come now!

15
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,281
Roger, Kuwaiti Star.
This is United States Navy helo

16
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,533
approaching your position.
Stand by, over.

17
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,494
Yankee Bravo, this is Nightingale 501.

18
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,496
We have visual contact
with the burning tanker.

19
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:05,041
Bearing 209. Range, two miles.

20
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:09,254
Have established radio communication.
ETA one minute.

21
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,756
Roger, 01. Continue inbound.
Be careful.

22
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,760
Get the TAO in here.

23
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,555
Yankee Bravo. Nightingale 501.

24
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,225
We have reached Kuwaiti Star's position.
Circling tanker.

25
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,352
It is on fire and adrift, over.

26
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,939
Roger, 01. Stand by.
Gunship is en route your sector. Over.

27
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,650
We cannot wait!

28
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,361
We are about to explode
and we have five men wounded!

29
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,530
Yankee Bravo,
don't think we can wait.

30
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,240
Request permission to go in.

31
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,326
We are carrying high-grade fuel!
We are going to explode!

32
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,494
All right.

33
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,371
Roger, 01. Watch yourself.

34
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,206
Kuwaiti Star, stand by.

35
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,000
We're coming in on your port side.

36
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,167
Thank you.

37
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,921
Okay, we move all the crew to port side
for you to pick up. Thank you.

38
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,173
Okay, Kuwaiti Star, this is US Navy helo.

39
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,845
Kuwaiti Star, we're moving into position
to lower a diver onto your deck.

40
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,724
It'd be a big help if you could keep an area
clear in front of the bridge for us. Over.

41
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,685
We're running 2K over the bridge,
and I'll go in on the port side.

42
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,478
We got a gunboat on our starboard side!

43
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,855
I got him here.

44
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,356
Unidentified gunboat,

45
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,108
I am an United States Navy helicopter,

46
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,776
here to take off wounded from the tanker.

47
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,155
I am unarmed in international waters.
What are your intentions? Over.

48
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,535
No! Webb's hit! Webb's hit!

49
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,580
- Webb!
- Yankee Bravo, we're taking gunfire!

50
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,707
Tell them to get the hell out of there.

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,500
Nightingale 01, get out of there!

52
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,547
Gunship, cease fire! Cease fire!

53
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,925
Yankee Bravo, this is 501!
They got our tail rotor!

54
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,720
- We're going to...
-01, get out of there!

55
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,348
The helicopter has been hit!
The helicopter has been hit!

56
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,933
Nightingale 01, this is Yankee Bravo.
Come in.

57
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,854
Come in, 01.

58
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:56,235
Nightingale 01, this is Yankee Bravo.
Come in.

59
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,030
Come in, 01.

60
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,192
Where the fuck am I?

61
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,474
Hawkins! Where's Graham?

62
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,767
Who cares?

63
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,563
He's getting married in 30 minutes.

64
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,152
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey.

65
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,659
How are you doing?

66
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,619
I don't know, man.

67
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,332
Stopped drinking
and started thinking.

68
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,043
Shouldn't have done that.

69
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,715
I don't know if I
can do this thing, Jim.

70
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,717
Come on, Graham.

71
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,553
I'll be there, right by your side.

72
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,889
We'll do this thing together.

73
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,392
What do you mean "we", paleface?

74
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,314
- I gotta get dressed.
- All right, man.

75
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,739
Lighten up, Chief.
The best is all ahead of you.

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,073
Like what?

77
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,202
Marriage, children, a commitment.
That's what's important.

78
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,162
It's too horrible to even think about.

79
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,414
Look, I have a commitment,
to the teams.

80
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,083
Yeah, well, the teams
aren't gonna last forever.

81
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,877
Then what are you gonna come home to?

82
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:22,006
A fridge full of beer and an address book
full of phone numbers, that's what.

83
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:26,135
Coming from a guy whose marriage
lasted all of what, a year and a half?

84
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,387
You should consider the source.

85
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,723
Is this really what you wanna do, Billy?

86
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,851
Yeah. Hell, I guess so.

87
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,354
You guess so. Well, that's beautiful.

88
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:43,319
Well, I'm sorry, guys, but I cannot be
a part of this funeral procession.

89
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,781
See you later!

90
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,537
He's a crazy motherfucker!

91
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,874
- I hope he dies of pneumonia.
- Did you see that shit?

92
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,422
Thank you!

93
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,895
What the hell am I doing?
I hardly know this woman.

94
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,106
You've known her three years, Chief.

95
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,636
We gotta go, now.

96
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,482
- Sorry, honey. I gotta go.
- Now?

97
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,151
This minute.

98
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,987
This is some kind of joke, right?
I don't believe it.

99
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,447
Sorry, Jo. Excuse me.

100
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,823
I know this is bad timing.

101
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,619
With you guys it's
always bad timing.

102
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,621
I'll call you when I can.

103
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,505
Close call, Chief!

104
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,051
He was either born lucky
or unlucky. I can't figure which.

105
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,472
- It's over?
- Never happened.

106
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,890
That was quick.

107
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,478
- What's going on?
- Balloon went up. Get in.

108
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,149
Gentlemen, there's a God in heaven.

109
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,062
You bastard!

110
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,114
Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!

111
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,139
- Clear!
- Clear!

112
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,182
Clear!

113
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,810
Real clear.

114
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,234
Search team in.

115
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,737
X- Ray, this is Bad Karma.
Objective secured.

116
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,947
Bad Karma, X-Ray.
What is your situation? Over.

117
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,950
Preparing to move. Three passengers.
On schedule. Primary LZ.

118
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,869
-60 seconds.
- X-Ray, roger. Out.

119
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,954
We're a SEAL team.
We're here to get you out.

120
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,123
- I believe you.
-50 seconds.

121
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,673
Bad guy.

122
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,967
Good guy.

123
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,054
I want you to relax, okay?

124
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,973
Hey, hey.

125
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,644
- Clearing, gotta move.
- Twenty-five.

126
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,778
We got a locked door over here.

127
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,571
Hawkins, don't break...

128
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,032
Damn!

129
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,914
We got an unknown in here.

130
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,542
We're compromised.
Everybody out, now!

131
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,088
I got him.

132
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,137
- What's he saying? What's he saying?
- He says he's an Egyptian sailor.

133
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,890
- Take his fucking picture!
- All right. I got it.

134
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,019
Bad guys thought he was a spy.
They beat the shit out of him.

135
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,896
Egyptian sailor, my ass!

136
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,149
I ought to smoke this
piece of shit right here.

137
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,193
Hawkins! Damn it! Let's go!

138
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,463
What was that shit at the door?

139
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,965
Room service.

140
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,600
- Where is he?
- Rooftop! Rooftop! Back of us!

141
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,438
God? God?

142
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,065
God here.

143
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,818
God, we got a single shooter,
southeast tower.

144
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,779
Yeah, I see him.

145
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,413
Nice shot, but you got two more.

146
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:58,128
Got nothing on starlight.
Switching to thermal.

147
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,091
Okay.

148
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,968
Hold on.

149
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,726
- God, what's our status?
- They're not moving. You're clear.

150
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,436
Let's move out.

151
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,906
Get those men inside!

152
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,537
We are meeting heavy resistance.

153
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,415
What the fuck is this?
Fuck this soft target!

154
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,375
They're coming out of
the fucking woodwork!

155
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,502
Bad guys! Alley! To the rear!

156
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:39,795
Fuck!

157
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,550
Hang on! God damn it.
We're losing him.

158
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,887
- We gotta get him out of here.
- Partying now!

159
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,017
Come on, Dale. We gotta move!

160
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,478
All units, we're cut
off from our primary LZ.

161
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,356
Going to LZ Two. Repeat, going to LZ Two.

162
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,483
Bad Karma, X-Ray. Roger.

163
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,279
You're starting to piss me off.
Now cool out!

164
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,282
I am cool.
You should see me when I'm hot.

165
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,367
- Help me.
- Jimmy, let's go.

166
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,870
- You gotta buy us some time.
- How much time do you want?

167
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,456
Bird leaves at 0245. Be there or swim.

168
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,166
We got more coming!

169
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,751
Ramos, give me a hand.

170
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,717
- Graham!
- Yo!

171
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,968
Cover me!

172
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,272
I hope these fuckers paid their gas bill.

173
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,237
- Case of beer, Billy!
- You got it!

174
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,704
Shit! Follow me!

175
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,026
Why aren't they firing?

176
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,656
That's why. Stingers.

177
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,202
- Shit! Guided missiles?
- Jackpot.

178
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,788
Bad Karma Leader, this is Bad Karma Two.
Do you copy? Over.

179
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,875
Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?

180
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,671
Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?

181
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,885
- May I?
- What do you have in mind?

182
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,011
Well,

183
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,389
I'm gonna do this.

184
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,518
Shit!

185
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,437
And now,

186
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,692
- I'm gonna do this.
- God damn it, Hawkins!

187
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,748
- It didn't blow.
- No shit, sir!

188
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,634
Behind those bags, cover. Take cover.
Let's set perimeters.

189
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,178
X- Ray, Bad Karma.
We're extracting.

190
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,891
Sniper on the wall!

191
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,395
There's another one!

192
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,695
Bad Karma, X-Ray coming in.
Take in five.

193
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,326
- Come on! We gotta go!
- Where's Hawkins?

194
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,250
Bad Karma, X-Ray grounded.
Load them up. Come on. Let's go!

195
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:50,462
All right! Extract!
Everybody go! Go! Go!

196
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,174
We just found an entire
warehouse full of missiles!

197
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,801
- We gotta blow them!
- What?

198
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,303
- Missiles!
- No! We're extracting!

199
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,514
Give me the breaching charges!
I can handle it!

200
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,516
- No! We're extracting now!
- I can handle it!

201
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,352
No! Let's move out! Go!

202
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,230
Units, let's go. Come on, let's move!

203
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,233
Let's go!

204
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,445
Come on! Move! In! In! In!

205
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,589
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray.
Pickup complete. RTB. ETA 10 minutes.

206
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,509
- How's he doing?
- I think he'll be okay.

207
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,013
- Good.
- Lieutenant, I really...

208
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,181
You guys are incredible. Thank you.

209
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,060
There's no reason to thank us
because we don't exist.

210
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,064
You never saw us. This never happened.

211
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,900
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray. On final.
Tally-ho.

212
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,028
One more thing.

213
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,487
You're welcome.

214
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:03,452
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray. Roger.
Steady 306. Needle's good on the ball.

215
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,831
X- Ray to Bravo. Clear to land. Pad two.

216
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:29,144
- Describe your method of entry.
- I came through a skylight.

217
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,147
- And you had contact in the hallway?
- One confirmed.

218
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,858
What was your action
at the objective area?

219
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,236
I entered the room in the third position.
Swept left to right.

220
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,074
- Did you fire your weapon?
- Fucking A, sir.

221
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,410
- There were no other documents?
- I got everything in the room.

222
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,413
- Everything?
- Everything but the onions.

223
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,376
Crew chief was dead.
Copilot had serious internal injuries.

224
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:56,088
I stabilized him, prepared to move.

225
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,923
That's when the shit hit the fan.

226
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,633
The primary LZ was aborted.

227
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,219
I covered their movement
to the secondary.

228
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,429
You engaged hostiles?

229
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,932
I vaporized hostiles.

230
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,851
Why did you decide to break
silence and blow the door?

231
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,104
I thought I heard something.

232
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,232
We all hear things, Lieutenant.
Some of us react differently.

233
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,401
Some of us don't react at all.

234
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,319
Why did you let this man go?

235
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,113
I had a plane to catch.

236
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,704
Can you tell us why you
elected not to go back in

237
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,290
and blow up the missiles, Lieutenant?

238
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,918
I had one dead and two wounded.

239
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,421
I didn't have time to dick around.

240
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,632
You consider searching for internationally
important munitions dicking around?

241
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,510
Hey, don't point the finger at me

242
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,098
about something you guys at intel
should've known about in the first place.

243
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,475
By the way, thanks for the hot tip

244
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,229
on the 100 assholes we
encountered at your soft target.

245
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,939
Makes you wonder
why they call it intelligence.

246
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,150
That'll be enough, Lieutenant.

247
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,573
Hey, mail from the boat.

248
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,659
Hey, LT, wanna lose
some of that combat pay?

249
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,120
No. I'll keep my 60 bucks, thanks.

250
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,393
Am I interrupting something?

251
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,103
No. No.

252
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,940
I thought you might
want to take a look at that.

253
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,406
Could have used this a week ago.

254
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,453
- Yeah, well, who knew?
- God damn.

255
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,872
I am still jacked up.

256
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,374
You wanna talk about a rush?
Fuck me!

257
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,377
You wanna keep that
emotion under control.

258
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,590
Yeah, but it's flowing through me, boss.
It's flowing right through me.

259
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,802
That high is not the
one you're looking for.

260
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,012
Believe me.

261
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,266
End of lecture?

262
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,227
Yeah, for now.

263
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,485
You cannot invade our land
and talk about security.

264
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:28,490
You cannot send soldiers into
our homes and talk about peace.

265
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:33,203
You cannot kill a man's family
and talk about human rights.

266
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,207
And you wage this war with acts
of terrorism against civilians.

267
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,877
If America kills our people,
then our people will kill Americans.

268
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,631
As in the bombing of the
Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983?

269
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,092
In the reprisal for the
shelling of our homes

270
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,887
and the murder of our
families by American warships.

271
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,639
He's a real sweetheart, huh?

272
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,767
- How does he fit in over there?
- Shaheed?

273
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,103
He just emerged as leader of a group.

274
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,938
- Al-Shuhada.
- Al-Shuhada.

275
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,190
- Whatever.
- Who are they?

276
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,067
They just put a new team in the field.

277
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,527
We know next to nothing about them

278
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,280
except we believe they're
connected to the Hezbollah.

279
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,490
Jesus! We don't know much
about anything, do we?

280
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,658
Who's that reporter?

281
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,951
- Claire Verens?
- Yeah.

282
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,412
- How come she's so knowledgeable?
- Well, she's half-Lebanese.

283
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,664
She's got contacts over there
we couldn't even hope to have.

284
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,874
She covered the Mideast
for the networks for five years.

285
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,711
She's a reporter.
She's not gonna give us anything.

286
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,880
What they've got is the
perfect terrorist weapon.

287
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,257
Portable, hand-held.

288
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,883
Jesus. What a mess.

289
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,429
Those fanatics got a warehouse
full of these missiles.

290
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,727
Why in the hell didn't you blow
those things when you had the chance?

291
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,104
Sir, the lieutenant made
a decision under fire.

292
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,106
And we stand behind that decision.

293
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,025
Navy SEALs, they're paid to take risks.

294
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,819
They're paid to get shot at,
they're paid to die if necessary.

295
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,655
- Now, I take exception to that decision.
- Damn it, Warren.

296
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,784
The point here is not what might
have been done, but what we do now.

297
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,794
With due respect, sir,
let me take my team back in there.

298
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,671
With my first-hand knowledge
of this Shaheed...

299
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,925
That'll be up to the President.

300
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,262
Now, we'll see if he wants to give
your SEALs another opportunity.

301
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,352
Nobody's blaming the SEALs
and nobody is blaming you, Curran.

302
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,562
Sir, I don't care about the blame.

303
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,897
I care about the safety of my team

304
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,649
and I care about
getting those Stingers back.

305
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,941
The situation has changed.

306
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,818
No one knows where in the
hell those missiles are.

307
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,528
It's up to the
intelligence community now.

308
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,322
It's out of our hands.
Completely out of our hands.

309
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,200
- I don't accept that.
- It's out of your hands.

310
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:39,037
You're an operator, not a policymaker.
Get used to it.

311
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,207
I had him.

312
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,875
I should have taken
him out when I had him.

313
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,294
How do you know you
would have made it?

314
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,589
I think more than likely you and
your team would have been waxed.

315
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,592
Well, like the man says,
that's what we're paid to do.

316
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,930
I want your team to
stand down for a while.

317
00:25:56,931 --> 00:26:00,517
Relax. Cool out. Get some
perspective on this, all right?

318
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,063
Lieutenant?

319
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,272
Aye, sir.

320
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,689
Keep your head down, hotshot!

321
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,069
Incoming!

322
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,008
- Fellow cake-eater.
- Hotshot.

323
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,011
- Brain grenade?
- Sure.

324
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,183
What, are you still
thinking about bad guys?

325
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,601
Yeah.

326
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,979
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- It's old news, man.

327
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,273
We go in there,
we hit them and forget them.

328
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,025
It's what we do, right?

329
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,693
There's more to it than that.

330
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,238
Look, if you got a problem,
do something about it.

331
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,740
You stick it out, then don't
be afraid to get it cut off.

332
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,909
That's what I always say.

333
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,578
You gotta get these emotions
under control, son.

334
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,010
I need to know if
this is what you want.

335
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,973
Jo, I want this.

336
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,852
I love you and
I wanna marry you.

337
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,272
And you... But you know who I am.

338
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:55,483
- And you just gotta understand...
- I understand, I do.

339
00:28:55,484 --> 00:29:00,280
I know that you can be pulled away at
any time to go anywhere. I know that.

340
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,782
If anybody knows that, I do.

341
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:07,328
It's part of the package and
I'm in it for the long haul.

342
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,165
I love you, Billy.

343
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,756
Just let my man shoot here, okay?
Just take it easy. $50 on this.

344
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,220
Wait a minute.

345
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,265
That's my car. He's taking my car!

346
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:32,478
Hey!

347
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,440
That's what you get for
parking on the fairway, Hawkins!

348
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,567
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

349
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,086
Oh, shit!

350
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,071
Okay, gentlemen. We're getting
another shot at those missiles.

351
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,492
Satellite photos show them located in
a merchant vessel called the Latanya

352
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,120
bound for Lebanon.

353
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:16,124
The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims,
which could present a hostage situation.

354
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,544
- How many terrorists, sir?
- We don't know.

355
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,505
So what do we do about
the hostage situation, sir?

356
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,882
Avoid it. At all costs.

357
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,428
That's right. The last thing
we want is an international incident.

358
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,346
You know, the missiles
could be booby-trapped.

359
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,641
So when you locate them,
call the bomb disposal group.

360
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,727
Sounds like a real pleasure cruise.

361
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,105
Your insertion platform is the USN Nayak,

362
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,400
presently shadowing the Latanya
off the coast of Syria.

363
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,079
- Captain.
- Well, here she is, gentlemen.

364
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,592
Looks peaceful enough.

365
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,510
Let's go swimming.

366
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:15,433
The op's a go.
Equipment check in 30 mikes.

367
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,394
All right, you heard the man.
Rock the box.

368
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,566
Lockout chamber clear.

369
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:26,903
Up! Up!

370
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:29,906
Open it up.

371
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,908
- Valve's open to the max.
- Water pressure?

372
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,527
Ask him where the gunmen are.

373
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,450
- Says there are none.
- Ask him about the missiles.

374
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,748
Nothing.

375
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,918
He's running out of time.

376
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,879
What gunmen? What missiles?

377
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,257
This is a merchant ship.
We're carrying machine parts.

378
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,179
What the hell's going on here?

379
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,724
We got the right ship.

380
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,916
- What was that?
- Deal with him!

381
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,793
Rexer! You stay.

382
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,172
Leader, this is Two.
Be advised, we've had an explosion.

383
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,465
What kind of explosion?

384
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,306
Hawkins, what's your status?

385
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,434
- Hawkins, talk to me!
- Hold on.

386
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,981
- What's he saying?
- Something about your mother.

387
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,155
Never talk about Mom.

388
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:51,328
- What's this?
- Looks like a dead terrorist to me, boss.

389
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,540
- What happened?
- Capped a bad guy down in the hold.

390
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,333
Looks like he fell
on his own booby trap.

391
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,170
Okay. Round everybody up, pat
them down. Let's get EOD in here.

392
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,588
You got it.

393
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,040
I've got nine crates
in the forward hold!

394
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,181
Lieutenant, I think
you boys have been had.

395
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,684
No shit.

396
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,817
True Islam does
not preach terrorism.

397
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:08,197
True Islam is one of the most
tolerant of the world's religions,

398
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,575
accepting Christians and Jews
as people of the same God.

399
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,456
True Islam also preaches
equality and justice.

400
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:21,043
The Shiite Muslims of Lebanon
have seen little of either.

401
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:26,006
Fourteen years of
devastating civil war

402
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,760
have given rise to small but
militant groups of fundamentalists

403
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:33,347
who believe the very survival
of their faith is at stake.

404
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,225
And then tolerance fades

405
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,812
and faith turns to anger.

406
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,566
For the Al-Shuhada of Lebanon,
it's turned to absolute rage.

407
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,110
- Perfect.
- Great.

408
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,570
Okay, that's it.

409
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,825
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

410
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:53,909
I'm interested in your work

411
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,997
and I thought I might be able to look
at some of your research material.

412
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,251
Who are you?
Who do you represent?

413
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,673
My name is James Curran.
I don't represent anyone.

414
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,634
I'm in the Navy.

415
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,595
And what do you do for the Navy?

416
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,514
I'm with the teams.

417
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:20,060
- A SEAL, huh?
- That's right.

418
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,021
Okay. Let's have lunch.

419
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,860
Why do you keep going
back to the Al-Shuhada?

420
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,863
Is there something special
about this group that interests you?

421
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:31,864
No.

422
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:37,828
You know, I don't think we're having
a Mideast current affairs lesson here.

423
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,206
I think we're talking about missiles.

424
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,458
Missiles?

425
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,212
Why the hell do you
think I'm sitting here?

426
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,423
Because I have strong
contacts who are telling me

427
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,550
that US missiles have somehow
found their way there.

428
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:55,095
Now I have a Navy SEAL
asking me questions about Shaheed.

429
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,516
You're telling me the Al-Shuhada
has gotten their hands on US missiles?

430
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,684
No, you're telling me.

431
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,020
- I didn't say anything.
- Me neither.

432
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,193
Come on, Lieutenant.
What are the SEALs up to?

433
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,488
Nothing special. Training.

434
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,199
May I take a look?

435
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,327
Sure.

436
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,549
Only about 10% will make it.

437
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,344
For these guys,
it's all about endurance.

438
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,237
All that and a paycheck, too?

439
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,366
A very small one.

440
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,035
- These guys, they don't do it for money.
- What?

441
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,414
- They don't do it for money.
- Then why do they do it?

442
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,711
I guess we're all trying to
prove something to ourselves.

443
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:55,007
It's called a dive tower.

444
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,592
What are they doing exactly?

445
00:43:56,593 --> 00:44:00,304
They're simulating planting
explosives on a ship's hull.

446
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,640
So you really think they're
keeping the missiles on a ship?

447
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,726
This is normal training, Claire.

448
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:09,605
Lieutenant Scott, you have
a telephone call on line three.

449
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:12,816
- That's normal?
- No, that's abnormal.

450
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,861
That's Hawkins.
He's part fish.

451
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,237
I think we'd better
get out of here

452
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,531
before he presses something
else up against the window.

453
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,334
- You ever had any Mideast assignments?
- Beirut.

454
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,420
- When?
- '83, '84.

455
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,925
So you were there during the
bombing of the Marine barracks?

456
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:40,677
Yeah, I was there, all right.

457
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,971
Lost a couple of
good friends that day.

458
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,391
So what about it?

459
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,852
Are you gonna tell me what I wanna
know about the missiles or not?

460
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,105
You don't seem to understand, Lieutenant.
I'm a journalist, not a spy.

461
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,984
What's this, the Officers' Club?

462
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:57,778
No.

463
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,364
We call this the kill house.

464
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,576
We use it for CQB.

465
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,411
Close-quarters battle.

466
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,665
Sounds like fun.

467
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,584
It is.

468
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,639
- Clear!
- Clear!

469
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:29,852
Thanks.

470
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,401
She's not upset,
is she, Lieutenant?

471
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:38,735
Sweet!

472
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,201
Hey, hey, hey.

473
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,121
What the hell was that about?

474
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,747
It's about being in
the middle of a war

475
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,083
and not being able to
do a damn thing about it!

476
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:57,462
You know he's got the missiles.
I know he's got the missiles.

477
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,298
Now, what are we
gonna do about it?

478
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,592
- Are the SEALs going after him?
- If we can find him.

479
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,093
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

480
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,344
Who does?

481
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:13,729
I don't know.
I don't know what I can tell you.

482
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,833
Good evening, sir.

483
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,418
Welcome to ll Giardino.

484
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,962
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

485
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,257
In the Fireplace Room.
Right this way.

486
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,595
- Hey, Hawk. How you doing?
- Hi, Ruth. How you doing?

487
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,643
I'm just gonna borrow your phone.

488
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:55,103
- Right this way, please.
- Great. Thanks.

489
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,193
Yes, can I have the
Command Duty Officer, please?

490
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,653
Thank you.

491
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,030
Yeah, this is Captain Dunne.

492
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,450
Beep Lieutenant Curran immediately.

493
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,826
Right away.

494
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,832
And you made your home
in the Navy, right?

495
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,211
Not necessarily. How about you?

496
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,964
Hi, girls.
What's happening?

497
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:24,132
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

498
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,843
There's a familiar face.
How you doing? Dale Hawkins.

499
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,553
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

500
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,973
This is Claire Verens.
She's a journalist.

501
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:33,976
- She specializes in the Middle East.
- Well, Beirut, really.

502
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,353
One of my favorite spots.

503
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,980
What a shithole.

504
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:42,192
- You been there?
- Are you kidding?

505
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:45,153
Rags knocking each other off
like the national pastime.

506
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,363
Rags?

507
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,242
Ragheads. Arabs.

508
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:53,578
I think they're all a few
sandwiches shy of a picnic.

509
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,164
I happen to be half-rag myself.

510
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,291
My mother's Lebanese.

511
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,459
Is she?

512
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,797
Well, I guess I've
done it again, haven't I?

513
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,215
What's new?

514
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,717
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

515
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,845
I was just being me, you know?

516
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,305
What's up?

517
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,393
I've gotta leave.
I'm sorry.

518
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,647
- Can I give you a call?
- Yeah, sure. That's fine.

519
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,233
- Can you give her a ride home?
- Gladly.

520
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,236
I'll be fine.

521
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,283
We'll see you around, boss.

522
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,621
So, where were we?

523
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,417
Well, I was insulting your heritage,
and now we're having dinner.

524
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,044
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

525
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:51,845
So I guess growing up in the wetback
section of Fresno wasn't that bad.

526
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,889
- It was...
- You mean Mexican?

527
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,934
Wet... Depends if they're
working for you or not.

528
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,645
You're gonna actually make me
think before I talk, aren't you?

529
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,731
I'm sure that'll be a first.

530
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:05,859
Anyways, my mom taught
school and my dad,

531
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:09,321
when he did work, he used
to supervise fruit pickers.

532
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:14,242
He had to drive around the fields
in a golf cart 'cause a Jap...

533
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:19,331
...anese mine blew both of his feet off,
so he couldn't get around too well.

534
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:23,877
He's a good guy, but he thinks I'm nuts
for being a full-time frogman.

535
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,938
What are we doing?

536
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:46,358
Well, hopefully each other,
if all goes as planned.

537
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,491
You don't like these guys?
Well, me neither.

538
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,952
So, you got a favorite tune?

539
00:49:56,953 --> 00:50:01,498
Yeah. Do you know "Turn the car
around and take me to my hotel"?

540
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,627
What's wrong? Look, we got
a beautiful ocean, we got the moon,

541
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,380
we got two people strongly
attracted to each other.

542
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,298
Two?

543
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,467
Well, one out of
two ain't bad, huh?

544
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:16,680
See you.

545
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:21,017
Wait a minute. Claire.
Come on. Claire! Hey!

546
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,727
Wait a minute.
Come here.

547
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:28,024
Now, look. You're a vaguely
amusing and not unattractive guy,

548
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,569
but I'm not even remotely interested.

549
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,698
And if you don't take me to my hotel,
that means I have to walk.

550
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:38,702
So I guess the weekend in Bora Bora
is out of the question, right?

551
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,165
Come on.

552
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,318
- Nice move.
- What's the matter with you?

553
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,737
- What's the matter with you?
- What kind of bullshit was that?

554
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,947
Hey, trust me with your life
but not your money or your wife.

555
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,449
You're an asshole!

556
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,702
What is up with you?
Am I missing something here?

557
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,371
- Yeah, a lot.
- Why don't you fill me in?

558
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,376
I told her about the Stingers.

559
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,212
Shaheed.

560
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,506
Well, that's great.

561
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,675
Why the hell did you do that?

562
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,135
Information.

563
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,930
Who are you?
The goddamn CIA now?

564
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,265
CIA's giving us nothing.

565
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,434
They never have and they never will.

566
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,398
She's all we've got.

567
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,112
We've still got her,
don't we, Hawkins?

568
00:51:57,657 --> 00:52:00,450
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she's still around. Sure.

569
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,827
Help me out with this.

570
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:05,872
Okay. You got me.

571
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,751
All you had to do was say something.

572
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,257
To recap our lead story,

573
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:17,842
a private jet carrying an
Algerian negotiating committee

574
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,179
was shot down this morning as
it left the airport in Madrid.

575
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,348
Seven passengers and
two crewmen were killed.

576
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,891
- What's up, skipper?
- Take a look at this.

577
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,394
Eyewitnesses report the plane exploded
less than a minute after takeoff.

578
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,896
Unconfirmed reports say
the weapon which downed the plane

579
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:33,650
was an American-built,
hand-held missile called the Stinger.

580
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,611
Two men believed responsible
for the attack were captured.

581
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,238
Spanish police say
they have evidence

582
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,491
that more attacks on
civilian aircraft are planned.

583
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:51,459
Did you hear what happened?

584
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:56,589
Your defender of religious faith just
blew a peace commission out of the sky.

585
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,925
It's happening, Claire.

586
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,971
Help us. Give me some information.
Something. Anything!

587
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,973
Why can't you understand?

588
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:07,851
I don't create the news.
I report it. I'm a journalist.

589
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,145
- You're involved.
- I won't be an accomplice.

590
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,481
Well, who are you helping by
not giving me any information?

591
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,529
All right.

592
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,241
Write your story. And the next one.

593
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,577
And when the next plane is shot down,

594
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:29,664
make sure you get the names and
ages of the innocent victims right.

595
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:34,544
Okay.

596
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:38,590
But I can't volunteer anything.

597
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:43,345
You ask the questions and
I'll try and answer what I know.

598
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,014
All right.

599
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,702
I think I've got something.

600
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,871
Walid Fahladi.

601
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:13,666
Wasn't he with Shaheed's go-between
at the second meeting that you had in...

602
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,335
- Balbec. Right.
- Balbec. Yeah, that's right.

603
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,920
Right, right, right.
Now we're getting someplace.

604
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:20,090
Except he dropped out
of sight six months ago.

605
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,841
- What are you talking about?
- Disappeared.

606
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,886
Kidnapping, probably.
Could've been the Israelis.

607
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,473
Great.

608
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:32,519
Now, that is the best goddamn
idea I've heard all day.

609
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:36,898
- What?
- What you just said.

610
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,108
What did I just say?

611
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,150
Why don't we just go in there,

612
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,903
grab one of these cheese-dicks
and make them talk?

613
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,530
Sounds great.

614
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,909
I don't think she's
taking us that seriously.

615
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,494
What do you expect?

616
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:52,580
I don't think you
understand the situation.

617
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:56,626
These guys are religious zealots.
There's no way you could make them talk.

618
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,378
You're dealing with extremists.

619
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:01,214
- And you're dealing with the Navy SEALs.
- Oh, okay.

620
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,641
All right. I've heard enough.
I've heard enough.

621
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,476
I can assure you
that this administration

622
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,979
will take no part in the
kidnapping of a foreign national.

623
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,981
- Warren, hear him out.
- No.

624
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:21,067
I appreciate your zeal in this matter,
Dick, but it's totally out of the question.

625
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,528
Just a minute.
We know this guy.

626
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,864
- You know him, Elliott?
- Yeah, he's a paid asset.

627
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,949
We've bought information
from him in the past.

628
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,576
I always thought he was a little fish.

629
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:32,412
If this guy has any information,
why hasn't he contacted you already?

630
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:35,206
He's probably scared shitless.

631
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,543
But if we extract him and we
make it look like a kidnapping,

632
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,463
I feel certain he'd sell
us anything he knows.

633
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,548
Look, can we call this a defection?
I'm thinking...

634
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,967
You can call it an immigration
if you want to, Jim.

635
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:49,304
The point is, you give the
guy money, he jumps into bed.

636
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:57,312
Warren, shall we continue to plan?

637
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:05,028
All right.
I'll update the President.

638
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,576
All right.
Let's go through it again.

639
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:15,497
It may be the last chance with
this model, so go over it again.

640
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,084
- Ramos.
- Street to south.

641
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,545
- Graham.
- Street to the north.

642
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,924
- Hawkins.
- Front door. First floor.

643
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,968
- Dane.
- Side wall. Second floor secure.

644
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,348
- Right. Rexer.
- Rear wall. Secure courtyard.

645
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,183
All right, for those people on the street,

646
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,352
if there's any trouble,
collapse on the house.

647
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:39,395
Those inside, stay inside.

648
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,981
We move out together, only together.

649
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:45,235
Remember, there's only
one hostile, a bodyguard,

650
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:47,737
so let's not hose down the place.

651
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,114
I'd be happy if no shots were fired.

652
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,783
So would he, I'm sure.

653
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,794
- I want you to keep right on top of him.
- I'm sure it'll be okay.

654
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:06,464
You're gonna be on Syrian and Israeli
radar the moment you take off.

655
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,633
So you have to stay
in commercial airspace

656
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:12,470
and jump from 12 miles
offshore and swim in.

657
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,389
Assuming everything goes okay,

658
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,559
the biggest thing to worry
about is the extraction.

659
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,561
You'll be extracting in a Ribex.

660
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:22,564
It'll be on radar the
moment it starts in.

661
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,108
You only get one pass at it.

662
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,235
If you're not right there
on time to the second,

663
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:29,612
you're gonna have to walk home.

664
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,532
We'll be there, skipper.

665
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:33,908
Do the deed!

666
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,683
Two hours in.

667
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:02,061
Forty-five minutes
at the beach landing site.

668
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,481
If I'm a no-show, you're taking them in.

669
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,318
With pleasure. Just a walk in the park.

670
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,819
No, it isn't.

671
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,405
Just because we aren't
expecting resistance,

672
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,282
don't relax on this one.

673
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:22,832
How you doing?

674
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,461
I hate jumping out of a
perfectly good airplane.

675
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:28,588
You don't gotta love it,
you just gotta do it.

676
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,409
What's our altitude?

677
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:03,122
- What's our altitude?
- It's about 30,000. That's six miles up.

678
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,832
You guys are crazy.

679
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,127
That's right, and proud of it, baby.

680
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,383
Zebra 23, six minutes
to launch point.

681
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:15,176
Copy, Black Fire.

682
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,011
Roger. Six minutes.

683
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,388
Six minutes!

684
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:24,435
Six minutes.

685
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:38,241
Hey, man, what's with the goggles?
You look like you're underwater already.

686
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,701
Eat shit!

687
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,798
Okay, gentlemen,
grab your masks.

688
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,717
We're beginning to depressurize.

689
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:57,677
We are going to depressurize here.

690
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,522
Let's go.

691
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,973
Jesus, Dane!
Who the fuck packed your chute?

692
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:48,436
It doesn't look good.
I wouldn't jump it if I were you.

693
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:50,772
All right, gentlemen.
Stand by.

694
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:54,066
On the green!
On the green!

695
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,945
One more thing.
For God's sakes, be careful out there!

696
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,531
If I was careful,
I'd be in the Coast Guard.

697
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,826
Five, four, three, two, one.

698
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,119
Go! Go! Go!

699
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,716
Oh, shit!

700
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:04,637
Shit! Graham's got a streamer!

701
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,430
Graham, release!

702
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,849
Release, Graham!

703
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,851
Bail! Bail! Bail!

704
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:11,435
Get away, Graham!

705
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,313
Pull out!

706
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,357
Pull out, Graham! Pull!

707
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,567
Pull!

708
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,159
Two booger-eaters dead ahead.

709
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,243
Easy.

710
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,533
There she is.

711
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,083
- Try and stay awake.
- You bet.

712
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:34,930
Team, this is Leader.
We're in.

713
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,058
Leader, this is God.
I'm in position.

714
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:39,393
This is Five.
Security set.

715
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,481
Two, this is Leader.
What's your status?

716
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,568
Leader, this is Two.
I'm in position.

717
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:02,083
Leader, this is Four.

718
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,921
I got a midnight stroller headed my way.

719
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:08,881
Is he gonna be a problem?

720
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,178
Four, this is Leader.
Is he gonna be a problem?

721
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:17,139
Leader, this is Three.

722
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,016
Ramos ain't being rude.

723
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:23,604
Our stroller just camped
out in his backyard.

724
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:24,897
What's his status?

725
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,443
If he was any closer,
he'd be inside him.

726
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:35,491
All right. Let's try to keep it quiet.
We don't need a confrontation right now.

727
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,826
You got it.

728
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:17,575
Leader, party just got bigger.

729
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,745
And they brought their fireworks.

730
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,832
I'm not there, Chief.
You make the call.

731
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,376
Three, this is Two.
Sounds like you need some help.

732
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,003
Negative, Two.

733
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:33,424
- I got them dead to rights. Stay put.
- I'm coming down.

734
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,135
- Hawkins, don't start anything.
- I'm on my way.

735
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,344
Hawkins.

736
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:50,774
Ramos, we're clear?

737
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:51,942
Clear.

738
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:56,030
All right, Chief.
Let's go tag them and bag them.

739
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,076
Hey, Chief.

740
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:28,520
He's dead.

741
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,235
I told you to stay put.

742
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,412
Let's get the fuck out of here.

743
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:55,524
Oh, God!

744
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,487
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

745
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,367
Detail, ready. Aim. Fire!

746
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:14,793
Aim. Fire!

747
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:16,503
Present!

748
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:29,785
On behalf of a grateful
nation and a proud Navy,

749
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,286
I present this flag to you

750
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:35,332
in recognition of your son's years
of honorable and faithful service

751
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,960
and his sacrifice for this nation.

752
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:41,004
Yes. Thank you.

753
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:44,675
Right!

754
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,094
Order!

755
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:00,399
I've got a right to know, James.

756
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,403
How did he die?

757
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,284
It was a training accident.

758
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,619
Bullshit.

759
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:16,582
You're lying.

760
01:12:17,459 --> 01:12:19,001
I can't talk about it, Jo.

761
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:23,755
You can take all of that classified,
unsung hero stuff and shove it!

762
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,722
Tell me something, James.

763
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:38,562
It may seem simple to you,

764
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:42,608
but if we had been married,

765
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,904
would I have gotten a flag?

766
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,408
Yeah.

767
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,912
You would have gotten a flag.

768
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:02,878
Oh, God.

769
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,721
- God damn it, man! I can't watch this shit.
- Another round here!

770
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,057
Let's get another round here!

771
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,227
Another round here!
Another round!

772
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:02,729
- Put it on my tab.
- You got it. Mr. Graham, right?

773
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,732
Billy Graham.
All the drinks are on me tonight.

774
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:08,110
- Big spender!
- That's right.

775
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,737
- What are you celebrating?
- Retirement.

776
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,739
Hey! Where's mine?

777
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,410
Retirement!

778
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:18,412
Hey, ain't it time for the game?

779
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:19,997
Hell, yeah. Turn it on!

780
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:21,498
- Turn it on.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

781
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,876
We're watching the Cuervo Gold
Golf Classic, okay? Thanks.

782
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:29,298
Is this your bar, squidly?
'Cause if it ain't, butt out.

783
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:32,634
You want me to butt out?
Okay, right, yeah.

784
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,387
This guy wants a beer
bottle shoved up his ass.

785
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,056
Butt out.

786
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,520
- Now who you telling to butt out?
- Hey, hey, hey.

787
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:46,273
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We just lost a good buddy.

788
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:48,525
Same guy that happens
to be on that television.

789
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,694
So, we're having a couple
drinks to say goodbye to him.

790
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,904
Now, why don't you say goodbye?

791
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,589
Fucking asshole.

792
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:12,924
I love you.

793
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,434
A toast.

794
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,270
Chief!

795
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,522
The best friend a guy ever had.

796
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:53,215
Hey.

797
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,926
What's your problem?

798
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,969
My toast not good enough for you?

799
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:03,183
You still don't get it, do you?

800
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:06,645
Don't you take any responsibility
for what happened?

801
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,109
How come you left the doorway?

802
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:14,778
Huh?

803
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,823
You looking for a fight?

804
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,787
You looking for a rush? A little rush?

805
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,707
Well, I hope you got it.

806
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:29,501
'Cause you're toasting a
man you put in the grave.

807
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,004
All right!

808
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,716
All right, I did!
I fucked up!

809
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:37,884
I fucked up and he's gone!

810
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,929
And there isn't a damn
thing I can do about it!

811
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,140
So what do you want from me? Huh?

812
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,972
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The party's over here.

813
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,849
Please.

814
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,642
No? I tried.

815
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:36,401
Hello?

816
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:18,026
You okay?

817
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:38,880
So when he tells you
where the missiles are,

818
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,091
does that mean you have to go back?

819
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:45,637
Yeah.

820
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,850
- You should...
- What?

821
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:55,647
Nothing. It's...

822
01:19:45,323 --> 01:19:46,907
They found them.

823
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:23,318
So Mohammed spilled the beans, huh?

824
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,446
Hey. I'm still a part
of this fucking outfit.

825
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,453
All right.

826
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,830
Grab your gear.
We're going to Beirut.

827
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,587
The missiles are located in a
schoolhouse in the Shiite slums of Beirut.

828
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:46,466
A contact from the Amal militia will
meet you on the beach and take you in.

829
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,803
Heavy fighting has just broken out,
so don't get involved.

830
01:20:49,804 --> 01:20:53,974
Just get to the missiles and blow them.
Be back in the water by dawn.

831
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,600
See you on the sub.

832
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,477
Make sure you're there.

833
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:43,875
Let's stash these boats.

834
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:59,724
Where the hell's this guy
we're supposed to meet? He's late.

835
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:08,691
You're late.

836
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,151
You from Amal?

837
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:16,032
Ali.

838
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:17,992
Christ, he's just a kid.

839
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,041
I guess the kid's on point.

840
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,786
Incoming!

841
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:08,001
Go! Go! Go!

842
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:09,460
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

843
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:30,023
Dark side of the moon, guys.

844
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:32,025
Green line.

845
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:35,612
Druze, Amal, Hezbollah, Al-Shuhada.

846
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:38,615
Israel.

847
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,369
The asshole of misery.

848
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:33,795
This ain't our beef, guys.

849
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:35,296
Let's move out.

850
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,747
Now knock it off! We need you!

851
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:13,376
- Watch the kid!
- Like he was my own.

852
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:23,261
I'm going to high ground!

853
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:25,138
Find it!

854
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:26,764
- Cover me!
- Go!

855
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:32,562
Fuck!

856
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,334
Hawkins!

857
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:55,501
Go!

858
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,762
Fucking kid led us
into a shitstorm!

859
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:07,472
What was your first clue?

860
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,433
Bad Karma, this is God.

861
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:14,020
I'm about 100 meters to
the west of your position.

862
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,230
Have multiple targets sighted.

863
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:24,113
God, this is Bad Karma.
Come in.

864
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,116
God, this is Bad Karma.
Come in!

865
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,453
It's not right.
I'm gonna go check it out.

866
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:31,996
Keep me posted.

867
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:05,863
You guys, I've got company up here.

868
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,449
You're an American?

869
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,952
God. Come in, God.

870
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,995
Your God doesn't help you now.

871
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:27,718
Dane?

872
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:40,148
Dane.

873
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,568
Hi, Lieutenant.

874
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,407
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

875
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,908
Yeah, I'm fine.

876
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:37,288
This is Two. Dane's dead.
We're coming down.

877
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:00,645
- Get us out of here, kid.
- Come.

878
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,677
There.

879
01:30:32,678 --> 01:30:34,178
- Where?
- There.

880
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,140
I go.

881
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,614
Looks like we got a slumber
party on the third floor.

882
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:41,078
Looks like about it.

883
01:31:42,456 --> 01:31:44,332
All right.

884
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:46,709
I'm going in.

885
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,919
I want in on this, Lieutenant.

886
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,963
Okay, let's do it.

887
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:52,423
You might need this.

888
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,277
Come on, guys.

889
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:42,890
- Clear.
- Clear.

890
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:43,891
Clear.

891
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:49,689
- Bingo.
- Verify it.

892
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:13,504
Let's pray for rain.

893
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,259
Jesus Christ!

894
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:21,137
Go to work.

895
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:35,860
Piece of cake.

896
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:46,537
Christ, the sun will be
up in 10 or 15 minutes.

897
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:49,999
When that light hits the water,
this boat will be compromised.

898
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,754
I'm sorry. In 20 minutes, we're
out of here, SEALs or no SEALs.

899
01:33:54,755 --> 01:33:57,006
Relax. They'll be here.

900
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:11,353
Leader, this is Two.
It's getting real bright out here.

901
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:15,733
- What the fuck are they doing in there?
- Maybe they're having breakfast.

902
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:24,241
Be advised.
We have movement on the second floor.

903
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:38,923
Boring conversation.
Leader, we're gonna have company.

904
01:34:38,924 --> 01:34:40,800
Rexer! Leary! We gotta go!

905
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:43,594
Do it.

906
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:05,032
Curran's hit.

907
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,332
Hello again, scumbag!

908
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:35,104
Hawkins! Blow it!

909
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:37,106
Sorry, boss. I can't do that.

910
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:39,859
- Sounds like an order to me, Lieutenant.
- Fuck his order!

911
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:41,569
Blow it. Blow it.

912
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,905
Leary, maintain your field of fire.
Keep their fucking heads down.

913
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:47,575
Hawkins, yeah, okay. I'm going hot.

914
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:51,453
Rexer, try and get an
angle on that balcony.

915
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:53,664
If he shows you a piece, blow it off.

916
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:57,710
Ramos, when I break cover,
you rock the front of that building.

917
01:35:57,711 --> 01:36:00,796
Here. You might need this.

918
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:30,910
This is Two. I'm pinned down.

919
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:33,579
Ramos, jump on the 50.
Put that fucker on his knees.

920
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:36,415
Hang tight. Hang tight.

921
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:37,958
Power is on its way.

922
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:45,257
Take that, Shaheed.

923
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,765
SEAL team.
I've come to get you out.

924
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:54,558
- Christ!
- Come on.

925
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,896
This is Two. We're moving.

926
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:08,822
Blow it, Ramos!

927
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:28,300
- You all right?
- Never better!

928
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,302
Need some help over here!

929
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:39,436
Go, go, go, go!

930
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,491
- I'm out of ammo here.
- You got any mags?

931
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:57,121
Morphine syrette.
Give me a morphine syrette.

932
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:58,497
I got it. I got it.

933
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:02,334
- Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh.
- Dress it. Quickly.

934
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:03,460
Quickly.

935
01:38:04,254 --> 01:38:07,214
Okay, let it go. Let go for a second.
Let go for a second.

936
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:09,091
You're really gonna love this.

937
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:11,468
Wow!

938
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:14,471
- Help him, Rexer. Ramos, you got rear!
- I got one mag left.

939
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:17,057
Use it! Come on, pull it!
Let's hit the beach!

940
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:51,216
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Move your fucking ass!

941
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:53,719
Out! Get out!

942
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,180
Get out! Move it!

943
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:58,098
Get out of here! Get out of here!

944
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:09,985
I got him.

945
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,536
Go! Go! Go! Go!

946
01:39:21,915 --> 01:39:24,708
Put your heads down.
Put your fucking heads down!

947
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:28,587
- Back down here. Back down!
- All right, all right, all right.

948
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:30,464
It's a one-way street!

949
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:34,134
Oh, shit!

950
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,609
We know the ocean is west
and we're traveling east,

951
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,778
so where the fuck are we?

952
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:54,029
Lost.

953
01:39:55,365 --> 01:39:58,200
It looks the same. It all looks the same.

954
01:39:58,201 --> 01:39:59,618
Stay left.

955
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:08,293
The sub leaves in five minutes.
This doesn't look good.

956
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:10,254
- It just got worse.
- Duck!

957
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:36,446
I think we lost them.

958
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:42,286
- Behind us!
- Oh, shit! He's right on my ass!

959
01:40:44,164 --> 01:40:48,709
- We gotta get out of here!
- No, don't move! He can't get a clear shot!

960
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:52,129
Hard right! Hard right! Hard right!

961
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:05,267
Leary, you got that missile.
You might wanna think about using it.

962
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:07,352
I would if I could figure
the damn thing out.

963
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:09,313
It's a one-shot deal.

964
01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:11,773
- What?
- You miss, we die.

965
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:26,246
- We lost them! I think we lost them!
- Thank God!

966
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,874
I can smell the ocean.
We're close. Real close.

967
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:30,209
Yeah, real close.

968
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:34,004
- Fuck!
- Get down!

969
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:52,522
Waste that fucker!

970
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:55,901
Eat this!

971
01:41:59,948 --> 01:42:01,323
Outstanding.

972
01:42:02,492 --> 01:42:04,952
- Come on! Come on!
- Rexer!

973
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:06,662
Rexer.

974
01:42:06,663 --> 01:42:08,622
The car's on fire, guys.

975
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,374
Come on, we got time.
We gotta get out of here!

976
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:12,209
- What about Rexer?
- Rexer's dead.

977
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:13,752
We got to leave him! He's dead.

978
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:16,171
Come on, Hawk! Get him up!
Get him up!

979
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:29,935
Come right 270 degrees. Depth, 300.

980
01:42:29,936 --> 01:42:32,729
All ahead standard.

981
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,356
Ten more minutes.
That's all I ask.

982
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:39,236
Look, I've got 107 men aboard this
half-billion-dollar piece of equipment.

983
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:41,697
No way I'm gonna hazard this boat.

984
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:44,658
All ahead standard. Depth, 300.

985
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,168
Come on.

986
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:57,981
Come on! Get up! Get up!

987
01:43:57,982 --> 01:44:00,984
They won't fuck with us in the water!
Come on!

988
01:44:19,796 --> 01:44:21,004
Get down!

989
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:31,681
Down!

990
01:46:58,579 --> 01:46:59,704
Clear!

991
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:12,592
- Any sign of the sub?
- What do you think?

992
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:15,303
It's typical.

993
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,560
Maybe they heard something.

994
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:24,688
Maybe.

995
01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:26,940
Maybe they heard the explosion.

996
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:41,871
How long you guys wanna wait?
