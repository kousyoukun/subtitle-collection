1
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:14,240
Cap station changed
to sector Lima, 50 miles, Angels 320, over.

2
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,243
I'm outside, roger.

3
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,373
Mayday! Kuwaiti Star here!

4
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,209
Your bogey, 20 right, 35. Over.

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,048
No joy.
Keep bogey dope coming. Over.

6
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,760
Target 306, platform. State 5.0.

7
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,262
Target tanker, what's your posit?

8
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,764
This is tanker Kuwaiti Star.
Mayday!

9
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,268
Can anybody hear us? Please, answer!

10
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,395
- Sir.
- This is tanker Kuwaiti Star!

11
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,023
Kuwaiti Star, this is United States warship
Yankee Bravo.

12
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,274
What is your situation, over?

13
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,694
We have been attacked! Five wounded.
Please, come now!

14
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,281
Roger, Kuwaiti Star.
This is United States Navy helo

15
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,533
approaching your position. Stand by, over.

16
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,493
Yankee Bravo, this is Nightingale 501.

17
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,454
We have visual contact
with the burning tanker.

18
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,999
Bearing 209. Range, two miles.

19
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,253
Have established radio communication.
ETA one minute.

20
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,881
Roger, 01. Continue inbound. Be careful.

21
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,885
Get the TAO in here.

22
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,555
Yankee Bravo. Nightingale 501.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,224
We have reached Kuwaiti Star's position.
Circling tanker.

24
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,352
It is on fire and adrift, over.

25
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,064
Roger, 01. Stand by.
Gunship is en route your sector. Over.

26
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,650
We cannot wait!

27
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,361
We are about to explode
and we have five men wounded!

28
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,529
Yankee Bravo,
don't think we can wait.

29
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,239
Request permission to go in.

30
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,326
We are carrying high-grade fuel!
We are going to explode!

31
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,494
All right.

32
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,329
Roger, 01. Watch yourself.

33
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,164
Kuwaiti Star, stand by.

34
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,999
We're coming in on your port side.

35
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,167
Thank you.

36
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,921
Okay, we move all the crew to port side
for you to pick up. Thank you.

37
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,173
Okay, Kuwaiti Star, this is US Navy helo.

38
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,844
Kuwaiti Star, we're moving into position
to lower a diver onto your deck.

39
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,723
It'd be a big help if you could keep an area
clear in front of the bridge for us. Over.

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,685
We're running 2K over the bridge,
and I'll go in on the port side.

41
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,478
We got a gunboat on our starboard side!

42
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,854
I got him here.

43
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,356
Unidentified gunboat,

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,108
I am an United States Navy helicopter,

45
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,776
here to take off wounded from the tanker.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,279
I am unarmed in international waters.
What are your intentions? Over.

47
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,535
No! Webb's hit! Webb's hit!

48
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,538
- Webb!
- Yankee Bravo, we're taking gunfire!

49
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,665
Tell them to get the hell out of there.

50
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,625
Nightingale 01, get out of there!

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,547
Gunship, cease fire! Cease fire!

52
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,967
Yankee Bravo, this is 501!
They got our tail rotor!

53
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,720
- We're going to...
-01, get out of there!

54
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,347
The helicopter has been hit!
The helicopter has been hit!

55
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,058
Nightingale 01, this is Yankee Bravo.
Come in.

56
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,854
Come in, 01.

57
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:56,360
Nightingale 01, this is Yankee Bravo.
Come in.

58
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,155
Come in, 01.

59
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,317
Where the fuck am I?

60
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,474
Hawkins! Where's Graham?

61
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,892
Who cares?

62
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,687
He's getting married in 30 minutes.

63
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,276
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey.

64
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,659
How are you doing?

65
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,744
I don't know, man.

66
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,415
Stopped drinking and started thinking.

67
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,168
Shouldn't have done that.

68
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,714
I don't know if I can do this thing, Jim.

69
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,716
Come on, Graham.

70
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,553
I'll be there, right by your side.

71
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,055
We'll do this thing together.

72
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,517
What do you mean "we," paleface?

73
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,438
- I gotta get dressed.
- All right, man.

74
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,738
Lighten up, Chief.
The best is all ahead of you.

75
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,073
Like what?

76
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,201
Marriage, children, a commitment.
That's what's important.

77
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,120
It's too horrible to even think about.

78
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,372
Look, I have a commitment,
to the teams.

79
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,083
Yeah, well, the teams
aren't gonna last forever.

80
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,877
Then what are you gonna come home to?

81
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,006
A fridge full of beer and an address book
full of phone numbers, that's what.

82
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,135
Coming from a guy whose marriage
lasted all of what, a year and a half?

83
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,387
You should consider the source.

84
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,723
Is this really what you wanna do, Billy?

85
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,851
Yeah. Hell, I guess so.

86
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,478
You guess so. Well, that's beautiful.

87
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:43,319
Well, I'm sorry, guys, but I cannot be
a part of this funeral procession.

88
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,906
See you later!

89
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,620
He's a crazy motherfucker!

90
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,957
- I hope he dies of pneumonia.
- Did you see that shit?

91
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,547
Thank you!

92
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,895
What the hell am I doing?
I hardly know this woman.

93
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,230
You've known her three years, Chief.

94
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,761
We gotta go, now.

95
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,482
- Sorry, honey. I gotta go.
- Now?

96
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,150
This minute.

97
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,987
This is some kind ofjoke, right?
I don't believe it.

98
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,446
Sorry, Jo. Excuse me.

99
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,823
I know this is bad timing.

100
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,618
With you guys it's always bad timing.

101
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,745
I'll call you when I can.

102
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,505
Close call, Chief!

103
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,175
He was either born lucky
or unlucky. I can't figure which.

104
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,471
It's over?
- Never happened.

105
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,056
That was quick.

106
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,602
- What's going on?
- Balloon went up. Get in.

107
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,274
Gentlemen, there's a God in heaven.

108
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,187
You bastard!

109
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,239
Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!

110
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,595
- Clear!
- Clear!

111
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,139
- Clear!
- Clear!

112
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,306
Clear!

113
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,935
Real clear.

114
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,234
Search team in.

115
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,736
X- Ray, this is Bad Karma.
Objective secured.

116
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,947
Bad Karma, X-Ray.
What is your situation? Over.

117
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,950
Preparing to move. Three passengers.
On schedule. Primary LZ.

118
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,994
-60 seconds.
- X-Ray, roger. Out.

119
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,912
We're a SEAL team.
We're here to get you out.

120
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,206
- I believe you.
50 seconds.

121
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,588
Bad guy.

122
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,798
Bad guy.

123
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,092
Good guy.

124
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,179
I want you to relax, okay?

125
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,098
Hey, hey.

126
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,768
Clearing, gotta move.
Twenty-five.

127
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,777
We got a locked door over here.

128
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,696
Hawkins, don't break...

129
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,157
Damn!

130
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,039
We got an unknown in here.

131
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,666
We're compromised. Everybody out, now!

132
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,213
I got him.

133
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,137
- What's he saying? What's he saying?
- He says he's an Egyptian sailor.

134
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,015
- Take his fucking picture!
- All right. I got it.

135
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,019
Bad guys thought he was a spy.
They beat the shit out of him.

136
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,896
Egyptian sailor, my ass!

137
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,149
I ought to smoke
this piece of shit right here.

138
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,318
Hawkins! Damn it! Let's go!

139
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,463
What was that shit at the door?

140
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,090
Room service.

141
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,725
- Where is he?
- Rooftop! Rooftop! Back of us!

142
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,438
God? God?

143
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,064
God here.

144
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,818
God, we got a single shooter,
southeast tower.

145
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,903
Yeah, I see him.

146
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,496
Nice shot, but you got two more.

147
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,253
Got nothing on starlight.
Switching to thermal.

148
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,215
Okay.

149
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,092
Hold on.

150
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,726
- God, what's our status?
- They're not moving. You're clear.

151
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,561
Let's move out.

152
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,031
Get those men inside!

153
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,495
We are meeting heavy resistance.

154
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,373
What the fuck is this?
Fuck this soft target!

155
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,375
They're coming out of
the fucking woodwork!

156
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,627
Bad guys! Alley! To the rear!

157
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Fuck!

158
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,674
Hang on! God damn it. We're losing him.

159
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,054
- We gotta get him out of here.
- Partying now!

160
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,141
Come on, Dale. We gotta move!

161
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,478
All units,
we're cut off from our primary LZ.

162
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,356
Going to LZ Two. Repeat, going to LZ Two.

163
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,608
Bad Karma, X-Ray. Roger.

164
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,278
You're starting to piss me off.
Now cool out!

165
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,281
I am cool.
You should see me when I'm hot.

166
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,367
- Help me.
- Jimmy, let's go.

167
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,994
- You gotta buy us some time.
- How much time do you want?

168
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,414
Bird leaves at 0245. Be there or swim.

169
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,165
We got more coming!

170
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,875
Ramos, give me a hand.

171
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,716
- Graham!
- Yo!

172
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,093
Cover me!

173
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,397
I hope these fuckers paid their gas bill.

174
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,362
Case of beer, Billy!
- You got it!

175
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,787
Shit! Follow me!

176
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,151
Why aren't they firing?

177
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,781
That's why. Stingers.

178
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,202
- Shit! Guided missiles?
- Jackpot.

179
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,871
Bad Karma Leader, this is Bad Karma Two.
Do you copy? Over.

180
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,999
Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?

181
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,796
Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?

182
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,051
- May I?
- What do you have in mind?

183
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,135
Well,

184
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,514
I'm gonna do this.

185
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,643
Shit!

186
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,562
And now,

187
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,817
- I'm gonna do this.
- God damn it, Hawkins!

188
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,831
- It didn't blow.
- No shit, sir!

189
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,633
Behind those bags, cover. Take cover.
Let's set perimeters.

190
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,303
X- Ray, Bad Karma.
We're extracting.

191
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,016
Sniper on the wall!

192
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,520
There's another one!

193
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,820
Bad Karma, X-Ray coming in. Take in five.

194
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,451
- Come on! We gotta go!
- Where's Hawkins?

195
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,249
Bad Karma, X-Ray grounded.
Load them up. Come on. Let's go!

196
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:50,462
All right! Extract! Everybody go! Go! Go!

197
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,174
We just found an entire warehouse
full of missiles!

198
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,800
- We gotta blow them!
- What?

199
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,303
- Missiles!
- No! We're extracting!

200
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,513
Give me the breaching charges!
I can handle it!

201
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,515
- No! We're extracting now!
- I can handle it!

202
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,477
No! Let's move out! Go!

203
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,355
Units, let's go. Come on, let's move!

204
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,358
Let's go!

205
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,570
Come on! Move! In! In! In!

206
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,589
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray.
Pickup complete. RTB. ETA 10 minutes.

207
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,509
How's he doing?
I think he'll be okay.

208
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,012
- Good.
- Lieutenant, I really...

209
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,181
You guys are incredible. Thank you.

210
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,060
There's no reason to thank us
because we don't exist.

211
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,064
You never saw us. This never happened.

212
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,900
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray. On final. Tally-ho.

213
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,027
One more thing.

214
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,612
You're welcome.

215
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,576
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray. Roger.
Steady 306. Needle's good on the ball.

216
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,914
X- Ray to Bravo. Clear to land. Pad two.

217
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:29,144
- Describe your method of entry.
- I came through a skylight.

218
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,147
- And you had contact in the hallway?
- One confirmed.

219
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,858
What was your action
at the objective area?

220
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,236
I entered the room in the third position.
Swept left to right.

221
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,073
- Did you fire your weapon?
- Fucking A, sir.

222
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,410
- There were no other documents?
- I got everything in the room.

223
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,371
- Everything?
- Everything but the onions.

224
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:52,375
Crew chief was dead.
Copilot had serious internal injuries.

225
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,087
I stabilized him, prepared to move.

226
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,964
That's when the shit hit the fan.

227
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,632
The primary LZ was aborted.

228
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,218
I covered their movement
to the secondary.

229
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,429
You engaged hostiles?

230
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,931
I vaporized hostiles.

231
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,851
Why did you decide to break silence
and blow the door?

232
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,103
I thought I heard something.

233
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,231
We all hear things, Lieutenant.
Some of us react differently.

234
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,400
Some of us don't react at all.

235
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,319
Why did you let this man go?

236
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,237
I had a plane to catch.

237
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,662
Can you tell us why
you elected not to go back in

238
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,415
and blow up the missiles, Lieutenant?

239
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,959
I had one dead and two wounded.

240
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,420
I didn't have time to dick around.

241
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,632
You consider searching for internationally
important munitions dicking around?

242
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,510
Hey, don't point the finger at me

243
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:48,097
about something you guys at intel
should've known about in the first place.

244
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,475
By the way, thanks for the hot tip

245
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,229
on the 100 assholes
we encountered at your soft target.

246
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,939
Makes you wonder
why they call it intelligence.

247
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,274
That'll be enough, Lieutenant.

248
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,572
Hey, mail from the boat.

249
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,659
Hey, LT, wanna lose
some of that combat pay?

250
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,203
No. I'll keep my 60 bucks, thanks.

251
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,393
Am I interrupting something?

252
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,228
No. No.

253
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,065
I thought you might
want to take a look at that.

254
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,531
Could have used this a week ago.

255
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,578
- Yeah, well, who knew?
- God damn.

256
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,830
I am still jacked up.

257
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,499
You wanna talk about a rush? Fuck me!

258
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,377
You wanna keep that emotion
under control.

259
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,590
Yeah, but it's flowing through me, boss.
It's flowing right through me.

260
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,802
That high is not the one you're looking for.

261
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,137
Believe me.

262
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,266
End of lecture?

263
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,351
Yeah, for now.

264
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,610
You cannot invade our land
and talk about security.

265
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,489
You cannot send soldiers into our homes
and talk about peace.

266
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:33,328
You cannot kill a man's family
and talk about human rights.

267
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,206
And you wage this war
with acts of terrorism against civilians.

268
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:41,044
If America kills our people,
then our people will kill Americans.

269
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,631
As in the bombing of the Marine barracks
in Beirut in 1983?

270
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,091
In the reprisal
for the shelling of our homes

271
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,054
and the murder of our families
by American warships.

272
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,639
He's a real sweetheart, huh?

273
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,767
- How does he fit in over there?
- Shaheed?

274
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,102
He just emerged as leader of a group.

275
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,938
- Al-Shuhada.
Al-Shuhada.

276
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,190
- Whatever.
- Who are they?

277
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,067
They just put a new team in the field.

278
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,526
We know next to nothing about them

279
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,279
except we believe
they're connected to the Hezbollah.

280
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,490
Jesus! We don't know much
about anything, do we?

281
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,658
Who's that reporter?

282
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:12,951
- Claire Verens?
- Yeah.

283
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,370
- How come she's so knowledgeable?
- Well, she's half-Lebanese.

284
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,622
She's got contacts over there
we couldn't even hope to have.

285
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,874
She covered the Mideast
for the networks for five years.

286
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,835
She's a reporter.
She's not gonna give us anything.

287
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,880
What they've got
is the perfect terrorist weapon.

288
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,256
Portable, hand-held.

289
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,050
Jesus. What a mess.

290
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,553
Those fanatics got a warehouse
full of these missiles.

291
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,726
Why in the hell didn't you blow
those things when you had the chance?

292
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,104
Sir, the lieutenant made a decision
under fire.

293
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,106
And we stand behind that decision.

294
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,024
Navy SEALs, they're paid to take risks.

295
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,819
They're paid to get shot at,
they're paid to die if necessary.

296
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,655
- Now, I take exception to that decision.
- Damn it, Warren.

297
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,909
The point here is not what might
have been done, but what we do now.

298
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,794
With due respect, sir,
let me take my team back in there.

299
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,796
With my first-hand knowledge
of this Shaheed...

300
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,925
That'll be up to the President.

301
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,387
Now, we'll see if he wants to give
your SEALs another opportunity.

302
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,351
Nobody's blaming the SEALs
and nobody is blaming you, Curran.

303
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,562
Sir, I don't care about the blame.

304
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,896
I care about the safety of my team

305
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,648
and I care about
getting those Stingers back.

306
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,941
The situation has changed.

307
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,818
No one knows
where in the hell those missiles are.

308
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,528
It's up to the intelligence community now.

309
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,321
It's out of our hands.
Completely out of our hands.

310
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,199
- I don't accept that.
- It's out of your hands.

311
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:39,120
You're an operator, not a policymaker.
Get used to it.

312
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,206
I had him.

313
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,042
I should have taken him out
when I had him.

314
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,294
How do you know
you would have made it?

315
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,589
I think more than likely you and your team
would have been waxed.

316
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,717
Well, like the man says,
that's what we're paid to do.

317
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,971
I want your team
to stand down for a while.

318
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,641
Relax. Cool out.
Get some perspective on this, all right?

319
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,063
Lieutenant?

320
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,397
Aye, sir.

321
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,814
Keep your head down, hotshot!

322
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,194
Incoming!

323
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,133
- Fellow cake-eater.
- Hotshot.

324
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,136
- Brain grenade?
- Sure.

325
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,183
What,
are you still thinking about bad guys?

326
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,601
Yeah.

327
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,979
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- It's old news, man.

328
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,273
We go in there,
we hit them and forget them.

329
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,025
It's what we do, right?

330
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,818
There's more to it than that.

331
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,196
Look, if you got a problem,
do something about it.

332
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,698
You stick it out,
then don't be afraid to get it cut off.

333
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,867
That's what I always say.

334
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,661
You gotta get these emotions
under control, son.

335
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,135
I need to know if this is what you want.

336
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,097
Jo, I want this.

337
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,976
I love you and I wanna marry you.

338
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,271
And you... But you know who I am.

339
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,483
- And you just gotta understand...
- I understand, I do.

340
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:00,238
I know that you can be pulled away
at any time to go anywhere. I know that.

341
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,740
If anybody knows that, I do.

342
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:07,411
It's part of the package
and I'm in it for the long haul.

343
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,290
I love you, Billy.

344
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,881
Just let my man shoot here, okay?
Just take it easy. $50 on this.

345
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,220
Wait a minute.

346
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,265
That's my car. He's taking my car!

347
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,516
Hey!

348
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,478
Hey!

349
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,439
That's what you get
for parking on the fairway, Hawkins!

350
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,692
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

351
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,210
Oh, shit!

352
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,154
Okay, gentlemen. We're getting
another shot at those missiles.

353
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,575
Satellite photos show them located
in a merchant vessel called the Latanya

354
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,078
bound for Lebanon.

355
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:16,123
The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims,
which could present a hostage situation.

356
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,543
How many terrorists, sir?
- We don't know.

357
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,505
So what do we do
about the hostage situation, sir?

358
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,882
Avoid it. At all costs.

359
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,427
That's right. The last thing
we want is an international incident.

360
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,346
You know, the missiles
could be booby-trapped.

361
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,641
So when you locate them,
call the bomb disposal group.

362
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,726
Sounds like a real pleasure cruise.

363
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,105
Your insertion platform is the USN Nayak,

364
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:42,525
presently shadowing the Latanya
off the coast of Syria.

365
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,162
- Captain.
- Well, here she is, gentlemen.

366
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,591
Looks peaceful enough.

367
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,635
Let's go swimming.

368
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:15,433
The op's a go.
Equipment check in 30 mikes.

369
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,519
All right, you heard the man.
Rock the box.

370
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,691
Lockout chamber clear.

371
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,027
Up! Up!

372
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,030
Open it up.

373
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,991
- Valve's open to the max.
- Water pressure?

374
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,610
Ask him where the gunmen are.

375
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,533
- Says there are none.
- Ask him about the missiles.

376
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,831
Nothing.

377
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,917
He's running out of time.

378
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,879
What gunmen? What missiles?

379
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,382
This is a merchant ship.
We're carrying machine parts.

380
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,304
What the hell's going on here?

381
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,849
We got the right ship.

382
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,916
What was that?
- Deal with him!

383
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,918
Rexer! You stay.

384
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,172
Leader, this is Two.
Be advised, we've had an explosion.

385
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,590
What kind of explosion?

386
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,306
Hawkins, what's your status?

387
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,558
- Hawkins, talk to me!
- Hold on.

388
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,105
- What's he saying?
- Something about your mother.

389
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,238
Never talk about Mom.

390
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:51,286
- What's this?
- Looks like a dead terrorist to me, boss.

391
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,540
- What happened?
- Capped a bad guy down in the hold.

392
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,333
Looks like he fell on his own booby trap.

393
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,169
Okay. Round everybody up,
pat them down. Let's get EOD in here.

394
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,712
You got it.

395
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,164
I've got nine crates in the forward hold!

396
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,306
Lieutenant,
I think you boys have been had.

397
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,809
No shit.

398
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,942
True Islam
does not preach terrorism.

399
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:08,155
True Islam is one of the most tolerant
of the world's religions,

400
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,658
accepting Christians and Jews
as people of the same God.

401
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,456
True Islam also preaches
equality and justice.

402
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,168
The Shiite Muslims of Lebanon
have seen little of either.

403
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,006
Fourteen years of devastating civil war

404
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,760
have given rise to small
but militant groups of fundamentalists

405
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,472
who believe the very survival
of their faith is at stake.

406
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,350
And then tolerance fades

407
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,937
and faith turns to anger.

408
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,690
For the Al-Shuhada of Lebanon,
it's turned to absolute rage.

409
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,068
Perfect.
- Great.

410
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,653
Okay, that's it.

411
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,783
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.

412
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,867
I'm interested in your work

413
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:58,080
and I thought I might be able to look at
some of your research material.

414
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,376
Who are you? Who do you represent?

415
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,798
My name is James Curran.
I don't represent anyone.

416
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,634
I'm in the Navy.

417
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,719
And what do you do for the Navy?

418
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,639
I'm with the teams.

419
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:20,060
- A SEAL, huh?
- That's right.

420
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,145
Okay. Let's have lunch.

421
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,985
Why do you keep going back
to the Al-Shuhada?

422
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,821
Is there something special
about this group that interests you?

423
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,947
No.

424
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:37,786
You know, I don't think we're having
a Mideast current affairs lesson here.

425
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,206
I think we're talking about missiles.

426
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,582
Missiles?

427
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,212
Why the hell do you think I'm sitting here?

428
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,423
Because I have strong contacts
who are telling me

429
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,550
that US missiles have somehow
found their way there.

430
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:55,220
Now I have a Navy SEAL
asking me questions about Shaheed.

431
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,516
You're telling me the Al-Shuhada
has gotten their hands on US missiles?

432
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,684
No, you're telling me.

433
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,145
- I didn't say anything.
- Me neither.

434
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,317
Come on, Lieutenant.
What are the SEALs up to?

435
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,571
Nothing special. Training.

436
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,282
May I take a look?

437
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,410
Sure.

438
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,549
Only about 10% will make it.

439
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,469
For these guys, it's all about endurance.

440
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,320
All that and a paycheck, too?

441
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,324
A very small one.

442
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,993
- These guys, they don't do it for money.
- What?

443
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,497
- They don't do it for money.
- Then why do they do it?

444
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,836
I guess we're all trying
to prove something to ourselves.

445
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,006
It's called a dive tower.

446
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,591
What are they doing exactly?

447
00:43:56,676 --> 00:44:00,303
They're simulating
planting explosives on a ship's hull.

448
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,640
So you really think
they're keeping the missiles on a ship?

449
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,725
This is normal training, Claire.

450
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,604
Lieutenant Scott,
you have a telephone call on line three.

451
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,816
- That's normal?
- No, that's abnormal.

452
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,819
That's Hawkins. He's part fish.

453
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,195
I think we'd better get out of here

454
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,614
before he presses something else
up against the window.

455
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:30,333
- You ever had any Mideast assignments?
- Beirut.

456
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,545
- When?
- '83, '84.

457
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,924
So you were there during the bombing
of the Marine barracks?

458
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,677
Yeah, I was there, all right.

459
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,096
Lost a couple of good friends that day.

460
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,391
So what about it?

461
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,852
Are you gonna tell me what I wanna know
about the missiles or not?

462
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,230
You don't seem to understand, Lieutenant.
I'm a journalist, not a spy.

463
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,109
What's this, the Officers' Club?

464
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,861
No.

465
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,447
We call this the kill house.

466
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,534
We use it for CQB.

467
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,494
Close-quarters battle.

468
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,789
Sounds like fun.

469
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:12,709
It is.

470
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,429
- Clear!
- Clear!

471
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,764
- Clear!
- Clear!

472
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,976
Thanks.

473
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,525
She's not upset, is she, Lieutenant?

474
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,818
Sweet!

475
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,284
Hey, hey, hey.

476
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,079
What the hell was that about?

477
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,705
It's about being in the middle of a war

478
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,208
and not being able
to do a damn thing about it!

479
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,462
You know he's got the missiles.
I know he's got the missiles.

480
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,297
Now, what are we gonna do about it?

481
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,591
- Are the SEALs going after him?
- If we can find him.

482
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,093
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

483
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,469
Who does?

484
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,853
I don't know.
I don't know what I can tell you.

485
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,833
Good evening, sir.

486
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,543
Welcome to ll Giardino.

487
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,087
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

488
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,382
In the Fireplace Room. Right this way.

489
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:46,720
- Hey, Hawk. How you doing?
- Hi, Ruth. How you doing?

490
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,642
I'm just gonna borrow your phone.

491
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,228
- Right this way, please.
- Great. Thanks.

492
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,318
Yes, can I have the
Command Duty Officer, please?

493
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,736
Thank you.

494
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,988
Yeah, this is Captain Dunne.

495
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,408
Beep Lieutenant Curran immediately.

496
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,909
Right away.

497
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,957
And you made your home
in the Navy, right?

498
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,210
Not necessarily. How about you?

499
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,963
Hi, girls. What's happening?

500
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,132
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

501
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,843
There's a familiar face.
How you doing? Dale Hawkins.

502
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,553
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

503
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,972
This is Claire Verens. She's a journalist.

504
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,975
- She specializes in the Middle East.
- Well, Beirut, really.

505
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,353
One of my favorite spots.

506
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,104
What a shithole.

507
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,192
- You been there?
- Are you kidding?

508
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,111
Rags knocking each other off
like the national pastime.

509
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,446
Rags?

510
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,200
Ragheads. Arabs.

511
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,536
I think they're all
a few sandwiches shy of a picnic.

512
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,164
I happen to be half-rag myself.

513
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,291
My mother's Lebanese.

514
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,584
Is she?

515
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,797
Well, I guess I've done it again, haven't I?

516
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,215
What's new?

517
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,841
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.

518
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,969
I was just being me, you know?

519
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,430
What's up?

520
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,393
I've gotta leave. I'm sorry.

521
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:20,647
- Can I give you a call?
- Yeah, sure. That's fine.

522
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,358
- Can you give her a ride home?
- Gladly.

523
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,319
I'll be fine.

524
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,366
We'll see you around, boss.

525
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,579
So, where were we?

526
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:40,417
Well, I was insulting your heritage,
and now we're having dinner.

527
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,168
Enjoy.
- Thank you.

528
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,845
So I guess growing up in the wetback
section of Fresno wasn't that bad.

529
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,013
- It was...
- You mean Mexican?

530
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,934
Wet...
Depends if they're working for you or not.

531
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,645
You're gonna actually make me
think before I talk, aren't you?

532
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,730
I'm sure that'll be a first.

533
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,984
Anyways,
my mom taught school and my dad,

534
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,279
when he did work,
he used to supervise fruit pickers.

535
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:14,200
He had to drive around the fields
in a golf cart 'cause a Jap...

536
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:19,330
...anese mine blew both of his feet off,
so he couldn't get around too well.

537
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:24,002
He's a good guy, but he thinks I'm nuts
for being a full-time frogman.

538
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,937
What are we doing?

539
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,483
Well, hopefully each other,
if all goes as planned.

540
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:54,449
You don't like these guys?
Well, me neither.

541
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,951
So, you got a favorite tune?

542
00:49:57,036 --> 00:50:01,498
Yeah. Do you know "Turn the car around
and take me to my hotel"?

543
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:05,627
What's wrong? Look, we got
a beautiful ocean, we got the moon,

544
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,379
we got two people
strongly attracted to each other.

545
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,298
Two?

546
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,592
Well, one out of two ain't bad, huh?

547
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,679
See you.

548
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:21,017
Wait a minute. Claire. Come on.
Claire! Hey!

549
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,727
Wait a minute. Come here.

550
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:28,024
Now, look. You're a vaguely amusing
and not unattractive guy,

551
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,527
but I'm not even remotely interested.

552
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:34,656
And if you don't take me to my hotel,
that means I have to walk.

553
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,785
So I guess the weekend in Bora Bora
is out of the question, right?

554
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,289
Come on.

555
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,442
- Nice move.
- What's the matter with you?

556
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,695
- What's the matter with you?
- What kind of bullshit was that?

557
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,905
Hey, trust me with your life
but not your money or your wife.

558
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,407
You're an asshole!

559
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,660
What is up with you?
Am I missing something here?

560
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,454
- Yeah, a lot.
- Why don't you fill me in?

561
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,501
I told her about the Stingers.

562
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,336
Shaheed.

563
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,506
Well, that's great.

564
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,675
Why the hell did you do that?

565
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,135
Information.

566
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,929
Who are you? The goddamn CIA now?

567
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,265
CIA's giving us nothing.

568
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,559
They never have and they never will.

569
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,523
She's all we've got.

570
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,195
We've still got her, don't we, Hawkins?

571
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,533
Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's still around. Sure.

572
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,910
Help me out with this.

573
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,955
Okay. You got me.

574
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,876
All you had to do was say something.

575
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,256
To recap our lead story,

576
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,842
a private jet carrying
an Algerian negotiating committee

577
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,179
was shot down this morning
as it left the airport in Madrid.

578
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,348
Seven passengers and two crewmen
were killed.

579
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,891
- What's up, skipper?
- Take a look at this.

580
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,393
Eyewitnesses report the plane exploded
less than a minute after takeoff.

581
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,896
Unconfirmed reports say
the weapon which downed the plane

582
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,650
was an American-built,
hand-held missile called the Stinger.

583
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,569
Two men believed responsible
for the attack were captured.

584
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,196
Spanish police say they have evidence

585
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,574
that more attacks on civilian aircraft
are planned.

586
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,459
Did you hear what happened?

587
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:56,589
Your defender of religious faith just blew
a peace commission out of the sky.

588
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,925
It's happening, Claire.

589
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,970
Help us. Give me some information.
Something. Anything!

590
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,972
Why can't you understand?

591
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:07,850
I don't create the news.
I report it. I'm a journalist.

592
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,144
- You're involved.
- I won't be an accomplice.

593
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,606
Well, who are you helping
by not giving me any information?

594
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,487
All right.

595
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:23,199
Write your story. And the next one.

596
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,535
And when the next plane is shot down,

597
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,789
make sure you get the names and ages
of the innocent victims right.

598
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,669
Okay.

599
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,715
But I can't volunteer anything.

600
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,469
You ask the questions
and I'll try and answer what I know.

601
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,139
All right.

602
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,660
I think I've got something.

603
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,829
Walid Fahladi.

604
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,666
Wasn't he with Shaheed's go-between
at the second meeting that you had in...

605
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,334
- Balbec. Right.
- Balbec. Yeah, that's right.

606
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,919
Right, right, right.
Now we're getting someplace.

607
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,089
Except he dropped out of sight
six months ago.

608
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,841
- What are you talking about?
- Disappeared.

609
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,011
Kidnapping, probably.
Could've been the Israelis.

610
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,473
Great.

611
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:32,643
Now, that is the best goddamn idea
I've heard all day.

612
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,898
- What?
- What you just said.

613
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,107
What did I just say?

614
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,275
Why don't we just go in there,

615
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,028
grab one of these cheese-dicks
and make them talk?

616
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,613
Sounds great.

617
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,867
I don't think
she's taking us that seriously.

618
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,452
What do you expect?

619
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,580
I don't think you understand the situation.

620
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,626
These guys are religious zealots.
There's no way you could make them talk.

621
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,377
You're dealing with extremists.

622
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,339
- And you're dealing with the Navy SEALs.
- Oh, okay.

623
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,641
All right. I've heard enough.
I've heard enough.

624
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,476
I can assure you that this administration

625
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,978
will take no part
in the kidnapping of a foreign national.

626
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,980
Warren, hear him out.
- No.

627
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,067
I appreciate your zeal in this matter, Dick,
but it's totally out of the question.

628
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,486
Just a minute. We know this guy.

629
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,822
- You know him, Elliott?
- Yeah, he's a paid asset.

630
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,949
We've bought information from him
in the past.

631
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,534
I always thought he was a little fish.

632
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,370
If this guy has any information,
why hasn't he contacted you already?

633
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,206
He's probably scared shitless.

634
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,543
But if we extract him
and we make it look like a kidnapping,

635
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,462
I feel certain he'd sell us
anything he knows.

636
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,548
Look, can we call this a defection?
I'm thinking...

637
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,967
You can call it an immigration
if you want to, Jim.

638
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,428
The point is, you give the guy money,
he jumps into bed.

639
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,436
Warren, shall we continue to plan?

640
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,111
All right. I'll update the President.

641
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,576
All right. Let's go through it again.

642
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,621
It may be the last chance with this model,
so go over it again.

643
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,126
- Ramos.
- Street to south.

644
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,587
- Graham.
- Street to the north.

645
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,965
- Hawkins.
- Front door. First floor.

646
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,135
- Dane.
- Side wall. Second floor secure.

647
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,389
- Right. Rexer.
- Rear wall. Secure courtyard.

648
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,224
All right, for those people on the street,

649
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,393
if there's any trouble,
collapse on the house.

650
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,437
Those inside, stay inside.

651
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,023
We move out together, only together.

652
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,276
Remember, there's only one hostile,
a bodyguard,

653
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,737
so let's not hose down the place.

654
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,114
I'd be happy if no shots were fired.

655
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,908
So would he, I'm sure.

656
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,835
- I want you to keep right on top of him.
- I'm sure it'll be okay.

657
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,505
You're gonna be on Syrian
and Israeli radar the moment you take off.

658
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,674
So you have to stay
in commercial airspace

659
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,511
and jump from 12 miles offshore
and swim in.

660
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,430
Assuming everything goes okay,

661
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,600
the biggest thing to worry about
is the extraction.

662
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,602
You'll be extracting in a Ribex.

663
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,605
It'll be on radar the moment it starts in.

664
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,149
You only get one pass at it.

665
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,401
If you're not right there on time
to the second,

666
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,612
you're gonna have to walk home.

667
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,531
We'll be there, skipper.

668
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,075
Do the deed!

669
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,724
Two hours in.

670
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:02,103
Forty-five minutes
at the beach landing site.

671
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,523
If I'm a no-show, you're taking them in.

672
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,484
With pleasure. Just a walk in the park.

673
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,819
No, it isn't.

674
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,405
Just because
we aren't expecting resistance,

675
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,407
don't relax on this one.

676
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,873
How you doing?

677
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,502
I hate jumping out
of a perfectly good airplane.

678
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,754
You don't gotta love it,
you just gotta do it.

679
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:58,409
What's our altitude?

680
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:03,164
- What's our altitude?
- It's about 30,000. That's six miles up.

681
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,874
You guys are crazy.

682
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,294
That's right, and proud of it, baby.

683
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,424
Zebra 23,
six minutes to launch point.

684
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,217
Copy, Black Fire.

685
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,053
Roger. Six minutes.

686
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,554
Six minutes!

687
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:22,058
Six minutes.

688
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,602
Six minutes.

689
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:38,240
Hey, man, what's with the goggles?
You look like you're underwater already.

690
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,825
Eat shit!

691
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,839
Okay, gentlemen,
grab your masks.

692
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,758
We're beginning to depressurize.

693
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,843
We are going to depressurize here.

694
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,688
Let's go.

695
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:44,014
Jesus, Dane!
Who the fuck packed your chute?

696
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,477
It doesn't look good.
I wouldn't jump it if I were you.

697
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,813
All right, gentlemen. Stand by.

698
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,108
On the green! On the green!

699
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,945
One more thing.
For God's sakes, be careful out there!

700
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,531
If I was careful, I'd be in the Coast Guard.

701
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,826
Five, four, three, two, one.

702
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,244
Go! Go! Go!

703
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,883
Oh, shit!

704
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,678
Shit! Graham's got a streamer!

705
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,472
Graham, release!

706
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,890
Release, Graham!

707
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,892
Bail! Bail! Bail!

708
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,602
Get away, Graham!

709
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,355
Pull out!

710
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,398
Pull out, Graham! Pull!

711
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,733
Pull!

712
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,159
Two booger-eaters dead ahead.

713
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,368
Easy.

714
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,658
There she is.

715
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,250
- Try and stay awake.
- You bet.

716
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,972
Team, this is Leader. We're in.

717
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,099
Leader, this is God. I'm in position.

718
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,560
This is Five. Security set.

719
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,647
Two, this is Leader. What's your status?

720
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:47,734
Leader, this is Two. I'm in position.

721
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,249
Leader, this is Four.

722
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,962
I got a midnight stroller headed my way.

723
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,047
Is he gonna be a problem?

724
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,219
Four, this is Leader.
Is he gonna be a problem?

725
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:17,181
Leader, this is Three.

726
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,183
Ramos ain't being rude.

727
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:23,645
Our strollerjust camped out
in his backyard.

728
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,063
What's his status?

729
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,610
If he was any closer, he'd be inside him.

730
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:35,491
All right. Let's try to keep it quiet.
We don't need a confrontation right now.

731
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,950
You got it.

732
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,699
Leader, party just got bigger.

733
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,745
And they brought their fireworks.

734
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,873
I'm not there, Chief. You make the call.

735
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,417
Three, this is Two.
Sounds like you need some help.

736
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,169
Negative, Two.

737
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,465
- I got them dead to rights. Stay put.
I'm coming down.

738
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,176
Hawkins, don't start anything.
- I'm on my way.

739
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,511
Hawkins.

740
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,816
Ramos, we're clear?

741
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,109
Clear.

742
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:56,154
All right, Chief.
Let's go tag them and bag them.

743
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,201
Hey, Chief.

744
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,687
He's dead.

745
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,401
I told you to stay put.

746
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,537
Let's get the fuck out of here.

747
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,691
Oh, God!

748
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,612
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

749
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,492
Detail, ready. Aim. Fire!

750
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,622
Aim. Fire!

751
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,960
Aim. Fire!

752
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:16,670
Present!

753
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,785
On behalf of a grateful nation
and a proud Navy,

754
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,286
I present this flag to you

755
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:35,373
in recognition of your son's years
of honorable and faithful service

756
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,126
and his sacrifice for this nation.

757
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,171
Yes. Thank you.

758
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:44,841
Right!

759
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:47,260
Order!

760
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,565
I've got a right to know, James.

761
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:04,528
How did he die?

762
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,408
It was a training accident.

763
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,744
Bullshit.

764
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:16,748
You're lying.

765
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,042
I can't talk about it, Jo.

766
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:23,922
You can take all of that classified,
unsung hero stuff and shove it!

767
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,888
Tell me something, James.

768
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,728
It may seem simple to you,

769
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,774
but if we had been married,

770
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,028
would I have gotten a flag?

771
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,533
Yeah.

772
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,078
You would have gotten a flag.

773
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,457
Oh, God.

774
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,044
Oh, God.

775
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:54,763
- God damn it, man! I can't watch this shit.
- Another round here!

776
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,098
Let's get another round here!

777
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,268
Another round here! Another round!

778
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,771
- Put it on my tab.
- You got it. Mr. Graham, right?

779
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,774
Billy Graham.
All the drinks are on me tonight.

780
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,109
- Big spender!
- That's right.

781
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,737
- What are you celebrating?
- Retirement.

782
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,864
Hey! Where's mine?

783
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,409
Retirement!

784
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,411
Hey, ain't it time for the game?

785
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,038
Hell, yeah. Turn it on!

786
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,539
- Turn it on.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

787
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:25,085
We're watching the
Cuervo Gold Golf Classic, okay? Thanks.

788
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,339
Is this your bar, squidly?
'Cause if it ain't, butt out.

789
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,676
You want me to butt out?
Okay, right, yeah.

790
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,553
This guy wants a beer bottle
shoved up his ass.

791
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,223
Butt out.

792
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,561
- Now who you telling to butt out?
- Hey, hey, hey.

793
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:46,314
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We just lost a good buddy.

794
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,566
Same guy that happens to be
on that television.

795
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,694
So, we're having a couple drinks
to say goodbye to him.

796
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,071
Now, why don't you say goodbye?

797
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,755
Fucking asshole.

798
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,091
I love you.

799
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:22,600
A toast.

800
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,311
Chief!

801
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,689
The best friend a guy ever had.

802
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,381
Hey.

803
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,967
What's your problem?

804
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,136
My toast not good enough for you?

805
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,224
You still don't get it, do you?

806
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,811
Don't you take any responsibility
for what happened?

807
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:12,275
How come you left the doorway?

808
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:14,903
Huh?

809
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,947
You looking for a fight?

810
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,787
You looking for a rush? A little rush?

811
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,748
Well, I hope you got it.

812
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,667
'Cause you're toasting a man
you put in the grave.

813
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,046
All right!

814
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,757
All right, I did! I fucked up!

815
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,926
I fucked up and he's gone!

816
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,970
And there isn't a damn thing
I can do about it!

817
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:43,306
So what do you want from me? Huh?

818
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:24,013
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The party's over here.

819
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:25,890
Please.

820
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,809
No? I tried.

821
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,568
Hello?

822
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,193
You okay?

823
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,922
So when he tells you
where the missiles are,

824
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,257
does that mean you have to go back?

825
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,803
Yeah.

826
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,016
- You should...
- What?

827
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,813
Nothing. It's...

828
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,031
They found them.

829
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,484
So Mohammed spilled the beans, huh?

830
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:26,571
Hey. I'm still a part of this fucking outfit.

831
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,453
All right.

832
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,997
Grab your gear. We're going to Beirut.

833
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:42,754
The missiles are located in
a schoolhouse in the Shiite slums of Beirut.

834
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:46,632
A contact from the Amal militia will
meet you on the beach and take you in.

835
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:49,844
Heavy fighting has just broken out,
so don't get involved.

836
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:54,015
Just get to the missiles and blow them.
Be back in the water by dawn.

837
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,641
See you on the sub.

838
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,643
Make sure you're there.

839
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,041
Let's stash these boats.

840
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:59,891
Where the hell's this guy
we're supposed to meet? He's late.

841
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,733
You're late.

842
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,318
You from Amal?

843
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,032
Ali.

844
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,117
Christ, he's just a kid.

845
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,208
I guess the kid's on point.

846
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,911
Incoming!

847
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,042
Go! Go! Go!

848
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,627
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

849
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,064
Dark side of the moon, guys.

850
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,066
Green line.

851
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,736
Druze, Amal, Hezbollah, Al-Shuhada.

852
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:38,739
Israel.

853
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,494
The asshole of misery.

854
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,836
This ain't our beef, guys.

855
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,463
Let's move out.

856
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,914
Now knock it off! We need you!

857
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,542
- Watch the kid!
- Like he was my own.

858
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,302
I'm going to high ground!

859
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,179
Find it!

860
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:26,931
- Cover me!
- Go!

861
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,728
Fuck!

862
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,375
Hawkins!

863
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:55,668
Go!

864
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,803
Fucking kid led us into a shitstorm!

865
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,638
What was your first clue?

866
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,599
Bad Karma, this is God.

867
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:14,061
I'm about 100 meters
to the west of your position.

868
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:16,397
Have multiple targets sighted.

869
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:24,238
God, this is Bad Karma. Come in.

870
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,241
God, this is Bad Karma. Come in!

871
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,453
It's not right. I'm gonna go check it out.

872
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,163
Keep me posted.

873
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:05,863
You guys, I've got company up here.

874
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,449
You're an American?

875
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,951
God. Come in, God.

876
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,162
Your God doesn't help you now.

877
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,885
Dane?

878
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:34,975
Dane.

879
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:40,314
Dane.

880
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,734
Hi, Lieutenant.

881
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:49,406
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

882
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,033
Yeah, I'm fine.

883
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:37,454
This is Two. Dane's dead.
We're coming down.

884
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,811
- Get us out of here, kid.
- Come.

885
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:32,718
There.

886
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,345
- Where?
- There.

887
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,307
I go.

888
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:34,738
Looks like we got a slumber party
on the third floor.

889
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,245
Looks like about it.

890
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,373
All right.

891
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:46,750
I'm going in.

892
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,003
I want in on this, Lieutenant.

893
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,005
Okay, let's do it.

894
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:52,589
You might need this.

895
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,402
Come on, guys.

896
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,931
- Clear.
- Clear.

897
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:44,058
Clear.

898
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,855
- Bingo.
- Verify it.

899
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:13,670
Let's pray for rain.

900
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,425
Jesus Christ!

901
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:21,303
Go to work.

902
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:36,026
Piece of cake.

903
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:46,578
Christ, the sun will be up
in 10 or 15 minutes.

904
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:50,040
When that light hits the water,
this boat will be compromised.

905
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:54,795
I'm sorry. In 20 minutes,
we're out of here, SEALs or no SEALs.

906
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,172
Relax. They'll be here.

907
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:11,395
Leader, this is Two.
It's getting real bright out here.

908
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:15,899
- What the fuck are they doing in there?
- Maybe they're having breakfast.

909
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:24,366
Be advised.
We have movement on the second floor.

910
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:38,964
Boring conversation.
Leader, we're gonna have company.

911
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,966
Rexer! Leary! We gotta go!

912
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:43,760
Do it.

913
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,157
Curran's hit.

914
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:13,498
Hello again, scumbag!

915
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:35,145
Hawkins! Blow it!

916
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:37,147
Sorry, boss. I can't do that.

917
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:40,025
- Sounds like an order to me, Lieutenant.
- Fuck his order!

918
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:41,735
Blow it. Blow it.

919
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:45,072
Leary, maintain your field of fire.
Keep their fucking heads down.

920
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:47,699
Hawkins, yeah, okay. I'm going hot.

921
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,495
Rexer, try and get an angle
on that balcony.

922
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,830
If he shows you a piece, blow it off.

923
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:57,751
Ramos, when I break cover,
you rock the front of that building.

924
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,963
Here. You might need this.

925
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:30,909
This is Two. I'm pinned down.

926
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:33,620
Ramos, jump on the 50.
Put that fucker on his knees.

927
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:36,456
Hang tight. Hang tight.

928
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,125
Power is on its way.

929
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,424
Take that, Shaheed.

930
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:52,806
SEAL team. I've come to get you out.

931
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,725
- Christ!
- Come on.

932
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,062
This is Two. We're moving.

933
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,947
Blow it, Ramos!

934
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,342
- You all right?
- Never better!

935
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:30,469
Need some help over here!

936
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,603
Go, go, go, go!

937
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:52,616
- I'm out of ammo here.
- You got any mags?

938
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:57,162
Morphine syrette.
Give me a morphine syrette.

939
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,538
I got it. I got it.

940
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:02,376
- Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh.
- Dress it. Quickly.

941
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,627
Quickly.

942
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:07,255
Okay, let it go. Let go for a second.
Let go for a second.

943
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,132
You're really gonna love this.

944
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,510
Wow!

945
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,513
- Help him, Rexer. Ramos, you got rear!
I got one mag left.

946
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:17,224
Use it! Come on, pull it!
Let's hit the beach!

947
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:51,258
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Move your fucking ass!

948
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,760
Out! Get out!

949
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,221
Get out! Move it!

950
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:58,265
Get out of here! Get out of here!

951
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,110
I got him.

952
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:19,703
Go! Go! Go! Go!

953
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:24,875
Put your heads down.
Put your fucking heads down!

954
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,628
- Back down here. Back down!
- All right, all right, all right.

955
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,630
It's a one-way street!

956
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:34,301
Oh, shit!

957
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,650
We know the ocean is west
and we're traveling east,

958
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,777
so where the fuck are we?

959
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:54,154
Lost.

960
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:58,200
It looks the same. It all looks the same.

961
01:39:58,284 --> 01:39:59,743
Stay left.

962
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:08,335
The sub leaves in five minutes.
This doesn't look good.

963
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,420
- It just got worse.
- Duck!

964
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:36,571
I think we lost them.

965
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,452
- Behind us!
- Oh, shit! He's right on my ass!

966
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:48,875
- We gotta get out of here!
- No, don't move! He can't get a clear shot!

967
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:52,295
Hard right! Hard right! Hard right!

968
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:05,308
Leary, you got that missile.
You might wanna think about using it.

969
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,394
I would if I could figure
the damn thing out.

970
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:09,354
It's a one-shot deal.

971
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:11,940
- What?
- You miss, we die.

972
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:26,288
- We lost them! I think we lost them!
- Thank God!

973
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:29,082
I can smell the ocean.
We're close. Real close.

974
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,375
Yeah, real close.

975
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:34,170
- Fuck!
- Get down!

976
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:52,689
Waste that fucker!

977
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,067
Eat this!

978
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:01,448
Outstanding.

979
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,951
- Come on! Come on!
- Rexer!

980
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,703
Rexer.

981
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:08,663
The car's on fire, guys.

982
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:10,415
Come on, we got time.
We gotta get out of here!

983
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:12,250
- What about Rexer?
- Rexer's dead.

984
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:13,793
We got to leave him! He's dead.

985
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,338
Come on, Hawk! Get him up!
Get him up!

986
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:29,976
Come right 270 degrees. Depth, 300.

987
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,771
All ahead standard.

988
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:34,397
Ten more minutes. That's all I ask.

989
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:39,235
Look, I've got 107 men aboard this
half-billion-dollar piece of equipment.

990
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,696
No way I'm gonna hazard this boat.

991
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:44,783
All ahead standard. Depth, 300.

992
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,334
Come on.

993
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:58,022
Come on! Get up! Get up!

994
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:01,151
They won't fuck with us in the water!
Come on!

995
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,171
Get down!

996
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:31,848
Down!

997
01:46:58,704 --> 01:46:59,871
Clear!

998
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,759
- Any sign of the sub?
- What do you think?

999
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:15,470
It's typical.

1000
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:21,726
Maybe they heard something.

1001
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,729
Maybe.

1002
01:47:24,813 --> 01:47:27,106
Maybe they heard the explosion.

1003
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,038
How long you guys wanna wait?
