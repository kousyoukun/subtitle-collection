-Careless squawks cost lives.

319
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,458
We have to lie low.

320
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.

321
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
If you can find me.

322
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,791
-[Fowler yelps]
-[hens] Ooh.

323
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,583
[Molly] What's it for, Mum?

324
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,583
[chickens clucking inside truck]

325
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,166
[gasps] Oh! What is that?

326
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,916
[chickens clucking loudly]

327
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,500
It's got a chicken sitting
in a bucket on it.

328
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,333
It's doing this.

329
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,375
[giggles] Oh, that's so funny.

330
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,791
Uh, let's go home.

331
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,666
[Molly sighs]

332
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,458
[chuckles softly]

333
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,000
Where are they going?
[gasps] Can we go with them?

334
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,333
-It looks like a lot of fun.
-I'm sorry, Molly.

335
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,791
-You're not ready to go off the island.
-But I…

336
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,458
Uh, Rocky? Little help?

337
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,916
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?

338
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,375
Why am I not ready?

339
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,750
I'm a big, brave girl.

340
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,000
-You always say so.
-I know.

341
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,708
But you're still a child.

342
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,166
Says who?

343
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,375
Says me and your dad.

344
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,541
Right, Rocky?

345
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,958
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes.
Listen to your mom, kiddo.

346
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,958
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow?
Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?

347
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
Something that's a little shorter.

348
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:20,833
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks
because I am a Lone Free Ranger.

349
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,166
Like Dad was.

[both gasp]

351
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,583
I've seen his poster.

352
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,708
Ah.

353
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,416
He used to live over there,
and you did too.

-[Ginger gasps]
-[laughs nonchalantly, clears throat]

355
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,291
Did I say that? I don't… I don't remember.

356
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,375
That's it.

357
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,875
Molly, you are not leaving this island.

358
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,833
You can't make me stay here.
You're not the boss of me.

359
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,083
Actually, I am.

360
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:48,458
Look, Molly, you've got
everything you want right here.

361
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,583
Except for one thing.

362
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,958
And what's that?

363
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,083
Freedom.

No.

Isn't it a bit late
for you to be out, baby girl?

I'm not a baby girl.

I'm a… I'm a big, brave girl.

415

And isn't it a bit late
for you to be out too?

[chuckles] Okay, I like it.

Molly.

[sighs] Although,
it's kind of a goofy name.

422
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,416
So I'm thinking of changing it to…

423
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,458
Zip it, kidda.

424

00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,916
To the happy chicken truck.

427
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,791
[gasps] You've seen them too?

428

Right.

Wherever that truck's goin',

431
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,958
it's gonna be cooler
than a penguin's toenails.

432
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,083
Uh, what's a toenail?

433
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,041
What's a penguin?

434
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:08,041
Oh! You have got so much to learn.
Come on.

435
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,875
[sighs] Wait for me!

436
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,916
I mean, so she found my poster,
and I told her a story.

437
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,291
I don't think that's such a big deal.

438
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,541
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible
to encourage our daughter

439
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,375
to be a Lone Free Ranger.

440
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,041
You know, if you had it your way,
she'd still be in her shell.

441
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,041
Well, better in her shell
than out on the open road.

442
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,666
So, do you live on an island too?

443
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,833
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.

444
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,208
Then the trucks came,
and they said I was too small to go.

445
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,750
But that's not gonna stop me.

446
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,625
You get to sit in a bucket.

447
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,333
What chicken doesn't want
their own bucket?

448
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,250
I want a bucket.

449
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,708
The thing about us, Mol,

450
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,458
is that we wanna go
where we wanna go whenever we want.

451
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,875
Yeah. With nobody telling us
what we can and can't do.

452
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
Me and you, kidda. All the way.

453
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,916

What is that?

462
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,375
You've never seen a human before?

463
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,041
We had them back at the farm.

464
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,083
[quietly] They're kinda stupid.

465
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,708
They fed us and tidied up after us.
They're basically like waitin' staff.

466
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,958
Oi!

467
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,250
-Oi, you!
-Huh?

468

How did you two get out here?

469
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,750

-[Molly] Uh…

470

00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,416
What an honor
to have a knight of the realm with us.

965
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,250
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant.

966
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,416
My name is… Oh.

967
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,000
[yelps, chuckles]

968
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,291
[Molly gasps]

969
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,458
Oh.

970
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,166
[splutters] Here at Fun Land Farms,

971
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,208
we do everything we can
to make our chickens feel right at home.

972
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,000
Well, I must say, I've never seen
a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.

973
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,625
Is all this security really necessary?

974
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,750
[Fry] Oh yes.

975
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,666
Molly.

976
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,083
You see, behind these doors are secrets

977
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:25,583
that will change
the world of poultry technology forever.

978
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,708
Come on.

979
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,375
[panting] No!

980
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,916
[all grunt]

981
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:39,166
Oi, what are you lot doing?

982
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,333

-[all] Attack!
-[guard groans]

985
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,625
This place is a maze.

986
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,000
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?

987
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,458
[footsteps below]

988
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,208
-There she is.
-[Rocky] Huh?

989
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,125
Molly?

990
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,375
Molly! Molly!

991
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,083
[Molly panting]

992
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:09,458
[Fry] And, um,
how's the restaurant business?

993
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,166
[Smith] Actually, a little slow.

994
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,541
[Ginger gasps]

995
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,458
[chuckling] Oh well,
I think we can help you with that.

996
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,541
Molly! [yells]

997
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,583
[Fry chuckles]

998
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,208
No! No!

999
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,416
Molly! Molly! Molly!

1000
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,291
[Ginger grunts]

1001
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,166
Ah. Ginger?

1002
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,083
[sighs]

1003
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,916
[ominous music playing]

1004
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,333
Right. I'm gone.

1005
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,125
Well, can't we just take the lift?

1006
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,666
[bell dings]

1007
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,541
All I can say, Dr. Fry,
is this had better be…

1008
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,375
good.

1009
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:52,916
[mysterious music playing]

1010
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,541
My, uh, partner
will be joining us shortly.

1011
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:04,166
In the meantime, we've prepared
a little presentation. [chuckles]

1012
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,208
Please, be seated.

1013
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,416
-[Fry chuckles]
-[control panel whirs, beeps]

1014
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
[whirring]

1015
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,500
[lively flute music playing]

1016
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,791
[film projector whirring]

1017
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,416
[narrator] This is an ordinary chicken.

1018
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,875
Plain, dull, and easily frightened.

1019
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:38,333
-[horn honks]
-[panicked clucking]

1020
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,458
[narrator] Like any simpleminded creature,

1021
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,958
its natural instincts,
when faced with processing,

1022
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,041
is fear and panic.

1023
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,458
[frantic clucking]

1024
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,791
[grinding whir]

1025
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,541
[narrator] When this occurs,
the muscles tense,

1026
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:55,125
which cause the connective tissues
to form knots.

1027
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,291
[muscle whooshes]

1028
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,500
[narrator] The result?

1029
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,583
Meat that is tough, dry, and flavorless.

1030
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,041
Mummy, this meat is tough,
dry, and flavorless.

1031
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,250
-I hate you, Mummy.
-Oh!

1032
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:10,708
Molly.

1033
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:13,208
[narrator] Fear not,
underappreciated mother.

1034
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,208
For what if science could change all that?

1035
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:20,208
For what if science could alter
a chicken's response to fear?

1036
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,791
[hen exclaims]

1037
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:22,750
[grunts]

1038
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,750
[narrator] What if it could make
a chicken happy to be processed?

1039
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:27,666
[hen exclaims]

1040
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,875
[grinding whir]

1041
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,708
[narrator] Then you'd say,
"Well done, science."

1042
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,291
[Ginger grunts]

1043
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,250
[narrator] Because a happy chicken

1044
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,458
is a tasty chicken.

1045
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,625
[cooker chimes]

1046
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:42,166
[chimes play]

1047
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,375
This is the most delicious chicken
in the whole wide world.

1048
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,750
I love you, Mummy.

1049
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,416
Thank you, science.

1050
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,666
[whispering] Molly.

1051
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,791
[control panel beeps]

1052
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,000
That's a clever little cartoon, Dr. Fry.

1053
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,708
But will you be able to do it?

1054
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,791
[woman, echoing] We already have.

1055
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,333
-[gasps] That voice.
-[footsteps approaching]

[tense music playing]

1057
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:30,208
Allow me to introduce my wife.

[tense music swells]

1059
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:35,208
[Fry] Melisha Tweedy.

1060
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,166
Welcome to the future.

1061
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:44,083
-[Ginger gasps]
-[sinister music playing]

1062
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,250
It's her.

1063
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,791
[sinister music continues]

1064
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:52,541
Darling, this is Sir Eat-a-Lot.

1065
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,333
The name is Reginald Smith.

1066
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:58,208
Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant chain.

1067
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:59,541
[Fry chuckles nervously]

1068
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,041
Hello, Reginald.

1069
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,666
I see you've met
my current husband, Dr. Fry.

1070
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,666
Was I attracted to his large inheritance
and vast acres of land?

1071
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:15,875
No, it was his mind.

1072
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:20,666
You probably can't tell
by looking at him, but he's a genius.

1073
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,375
You flatter me, darling. [chuckles]

1074
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:26,708
With degrees from Oxford
and Cambridge in clinical neurology,

1075
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:30,541
behavioral psychology,
genetic engineering…

1076
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,750
And drama!

1077
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,583
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]
-[Fry yelps, thuds]

1078
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,458
Now you've had the appetizer,

1079
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,333
time for the main course.

1080
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:43,666
Come.

1081
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,000
[Fry groans]

1082
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,791
[energetic music playing]

1083
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,291
Molly, no. Get back.

1084
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,000
[grunting, muffled] Let me go!

1085
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,708
Right. Try and find Molly.

1086
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,958
-[control panel beeping]
-Oh, look.

1087
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,750
Rocky and the rats are on telly.

1088
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:05,208
Looks like a real cliffhanger.

1089
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:06,958
-[Bunty grunts]
-Where is she?

1090

[ominous music playing]

1091
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,750
Oh.

1092
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,833
[hens clamoring below]

1093
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,208
[Fry] Oh, look.

1094
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,666
They like the new egg cup ride.

1095
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:24,791
[chuckles sheepishly]

1096

[Molly gasps]

1097
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,541
[quietly] Frizzle.

1098
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,375
[gasps] Mum?

1099
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,000
Oh, Mollypod.

1100
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,291
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1101
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,000
Promise never to run away again.

1102
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,458
-Did they hurt you?
-I'm fine, but I think they eat…

1103
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,750
-[Mrs. Tweedy] Come on. Get on with it.
-Shh.

1104
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,625
[Fry] Right you are, pumpkin.

1105
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,708
Behold.

1106
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,208
[dramatically] The remote control.

1107
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:55,000
-And the other remote controls.
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

1108
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,625
Why three?

1109
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,833
-Nobody knows.
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

1110
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,833
Let's go with…

1111
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,541
that one.

1112
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,416
-[collars power down]
-[hens] Huh?

1113
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,375
-Why am I playing golf?
-Where am I?

1114
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:14,541
-What am I doing?
-Molly? Where are you, Molly?

1115
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,333
What's going on?

1116
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:19,083
[splutters] No, no, no.
Wrong one, my angel.

1117

-That's the off button. [chuckles]

-[gasps] It's me.
-[joyful fanfare playing]

1124

01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:48,958
I should not have told you all
of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.

1442
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,916
No, this is on me.

1443
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,916
I used to hate being fenced in.

1444
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,083
So why did I expect you
to be any different?

1445
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,875
I guess I was afraid
you were so much like me.

1446
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,333
What's wrong with being like you?

1447
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,000
Nothing.

1448
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,833
-Because your mom is the best.
-[sighs]

1449
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:19,083
And she always has a plan.

1450
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,041
Not this time.

1451
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:23,750
[tense music playing]

1452
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,583
[sighs] He's here.

[Fry murmuring nervously]

1454
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,708
-Are we ready to fry, Fry?
-[buttons beeping]

1455
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,375
Five minutes, pumpkin. [chuckles]

1456
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,541
-Make it four.
-[Fry, shakily] Oh.

1457
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:35,250
Where is she?

1458
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,583
-[bell dings]
-Hmm?

1459
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:41,083
Them runaway chickens, uh,
have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.

1460
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,708
In the silo, you say?

1461
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,166
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.

1462
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,416
Production starts in three minutes.

1463
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,875
[splutters] Three? [yelps]

1464
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:55,041
Looks like you've just run out of cluck,
little chickens.

1465
01:06:56,833 --> 01:07:00,916
-[machine whirring]
-[menacing orchestral music playing]

1466
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,958
[rumbling]

1467
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,208
[family] Huh?

1468
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,125
[Rocky] Huh?

1469
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:06,750
Huh?

1470
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,166
[Babs whines]

1471
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,666
I think there's a grinder
at the bottom of this thing.

1472
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,625
On the plus side, though,
we will all probably drown

1473
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,666
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.

1474
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1475
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,333
Popcorn. [chuckles nervously]

1476
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:25,208
Popcorn, everyone. Look.
Look, popcorn. [laughs]

1477
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,250
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to…

1478
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:31,958
Ah.

1479
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,750
[bright music playing]

1480
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:36,583
The answer to all life's problems.

1481
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:37,708
Of course.

1482
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,916
Mac, we need heat.

1483
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,625
-Lots of it.
-[Mac] Oh.

1484
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,833
Will this work? [grunts]

1485
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,708
[grunts] Perfect.

1486
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:48,541
[grunts] Now, does anyone have a match?

1487
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.

1488
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,291
-You'll blow us all to bits.
-[Molly gasps]

1489
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:59,458
Besides, we've used the last one.

1490
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,375
Oh no.

1491
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,333
-[gentle chimes]
-[Rocky gasps]

1492
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,375
[gasps] That's my girl.

01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:15,916
[suspenseful music playing]

1494
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,041
Um, can I once again raise
my health and safety concerns?

1495
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:21,458
What is it?

1496
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:23,458
[Rocky and Babs yelp]

1497
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:25,625
-[both] Huh?
-[rumbling and popping]

1498
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,000
All right.

1499
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,041
Oh!

1500
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,666
[alarm blaring]

1501
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,541
Mm. That tastes nice.

1502
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:39,958
Is there any more?

1503
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,708
[all scream]

1504
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,125
[Fowler] But guess what?

1505
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,916
Just as Whizzbang Charlie
thought we were back in Blighty,

1506
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,291
enemy fire at six o'clock.

1507
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,791
-[whimsical music playing]
-Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?

1508
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,791
Good old British weather.

1509
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:04,958
Unpredictable.

1510
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,458
You never know what's coming.

1511
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:08,333
-[groans]
-[Bunty sighs]

1512
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,000
Outrageous.

1513
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:13,333
[laughs]

-[groans]
-[Molly] Hmm?

01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,041
[laughing and cheering]

1520
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,125
-Get in there!
-We made it.

1521
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,875
-Look.
-[Fetcher] Whoo-hoo!

1522
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:29,750
Fowler's only gone
and set up our escape route.

1523
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:34,375
-[bright music playing]
-Well done, you old sausage.

1524
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,791
Firm handshake will do, thank you.

1525
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:41,708
[laughs] Mission accomplished.
Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?

1526
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,208
[Babs] Oh yes.

1527
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:45,416
[group chattering excitedly]

1528
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,666
[Fetcher] Oh, look, Nick.

1529
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,333
Have we got snacks for the way home?

Ginger, are you coming?

1539
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,375
No, I'm not.

1540
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,291
I'm going back.

[Molly gasps]

1542
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,333
For Frizzle?

1543
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,250
For Frizzle and all the chickens.

-Yes!

[tender instrumental music playing]

1546
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:44,375
Just because where we live is cut off
from the world doesn't mean we are too.

1547
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,833
No chicken is an island.

1548
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,291
[Rocky] Hmm.

1549
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,166
We are with you, Ginger.

1550
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,125
Aye, me too.

1551
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,583
Me four.

1552
01:10:58,666 --> 01:10:59,708
The rats are in.

1553
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,833
Right. What's the plan, Mum?

1554
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:08,541
Oh, well, I didn't think you…

1555
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:10,583
Rocky.

1556
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:15,750
Hey, Molly, um,
are you sure you're ready for this?

1557
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,125
-I was hatched ready, Dad.

What was that noise up on the roof?

1563
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,041
-[guard grunts, thuds]
-Sounded like an explosion.

1564
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:41,916
[gasps, yelps] Looks like one of the silos
has blown its top.

1565
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,458
-[alarm blaring]
-Oh.

1566
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,458
Maybe you shouldn't have put
those chickens

1567
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,500
through the grinder, my love.

1568
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,208
Don't be ridiculous.

1569
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,916
[Smith] Melisha,
all ready for the big day?

1570
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,375
[Mrs. Tweedy sighs]

1571
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:56,333
[cheerfully] Oh yes, Reginald.

1572
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,208
Everything is tickety-boo.

1573
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:01,041
[Smith] Jolly good.
My truck is ready to go.

1574
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,875
We've got to move fast.

1575
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,166
While Tweedy is busy
with her guest outside,

1576
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,250
we sneak back in.

1577
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:10,916
Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac
to where all the chickens are.

1578
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,083
Come on.

1579
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,375
-This way.
-[Babs] Ah.

1580
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:16,125
[Ginger] Stay out of sight

1581
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,666
and get ready to stop
the chickens going up that staircase.

1582
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,833
Rocky, we've got
to get hold of that button.

1583
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,208
-[remote beeps]
-[Ginger] And disable those collars.

1584
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:26,250
[hens murmur]

1585
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,125
[Ginger] As soon as the collars are off,

1586
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,083
Molly's team leads the chickens
out of there.

1587
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,208
-We bust our way out.
-[hens clamoring]

1588
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:36,208
Steal the truck,

1589
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,958
then we're home free.

1590
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,208
Well, what are we waiting for?

1591
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:43,375
-All right. Let's do this.
-We're doing it today, are we?

1592
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,291
[Fowler] So where was I? Ah, yes.

1593
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,666
Whizzbang Charlie had lost
his undercarriage,

1594
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,458
and the old crate was catching fire…

1595
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,458
[gentle music playing]

1596
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:57,583
Actually, Melisha,
I have a little something for our big day.

1597
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:02,500
[sweetly] Why, Reginald,
this is all very sudden.

1598
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,958
-Uh…
-[music stops abruptly]

1599
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:06,041

我要跟你說一個故事

關於我們從養雞場逃出來的故事

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,208
從前有一位雞農

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,916
她對雞恨之入骨

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,750
把雞像囚犯一樣關起來

10

可以說是磨斧霍霍向雞群

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,791
她買了一臺

14
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,625
能把雞做成餡餅的機器

15
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,125
我們絕對不能驚慌！

16
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,875
但她沒料到的是

17
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,333
她會跟一隻

18
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:59,333
為自由抗爭的母雞針鋒相對

19
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,083
她兇猛無畏

20
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,708
而且滿腦子衹有一個念頭

21
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,041
自由

22
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,791
她讓雞群團結一致

23
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,000
還給了我們一對飛出雞場的翅膀

24
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,541
她救出裡面的每一隻雞

25
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,875
同時擺脫了那位邪惡雞農的魔掌

26

27

00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,333

52
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,958
妳說得沒錯

53
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,541

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,166
-給你
-莫莉，幫爸爸拿著

103
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,000
-很高興見到你們
-下個月再見

104
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,375
妳好，小母雞

105
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,333
掰掰！

106
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,458
看招

107
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,458
不可以，你作弊！

108
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,541
晚點見

109
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,041
-大家好
-早安

110
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,500
-早安
-早安

111
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,291
-大家好
-早安，小傢伙

112
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,291
媽

113
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,208
妳好，親愛的

114
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,666
老爸

115
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,000
尼克叔叔！費奇叔叔！

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
她剛才…叫我“叔叔”

117
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,375
冷靜點，夥計

118
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,416
冷靜

119
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,958
可是我從來沒有家人

120
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,208
我也沒有

121
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,958
媽

122
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,416
我在想

123
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,291
我們可以去那一頭嗎？

124
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,250
哪一頭？

125
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,208
河水的另一頭

126
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,791
我們已經討論過了，莫莉

127
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,791
那裡什麼都沒有

128
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,458
尼克叔叔和費奇叔叔帶來的東西呢？

129
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,958
不是給我們的嗎？

130
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,583
怎麼了？金潔

131
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,916
洛奇

132
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,375
莫莉在問是否能離開這座島

133
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,333
瞭解

134
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,541
我懂了

135
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,041
莫莉，妳想看世上最酷的發明嗎？

136
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:13,791
好吧

137
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,666
爸，這是什麼東西？

138
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,500
人生所有難題的答案

139
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,875
爆米花

140
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,291
妳們說這是不是世上最棒的發明？

141
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,916
真的很棒

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,916
何止很棒

143
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,541
根本是超讚！

144
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,125
女兒，在這世上

145
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,750
沒有比這更棒的人生了

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
媽

147
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,375
怎麼了？

148
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,083
沒什麼好擔心的，莫莉

149
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,416
什麼事都沒有

150
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,875
人類出現衹是時間問題

151
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,791
看來人類要載他們去像養雞場的地方

152
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,166
我好久沒看到那種表情了

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,791
妳無法改正世上所有錯誤，雞友

154
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,708
今晚開會

155
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,500
去通知大家

156
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,166
又來了

157
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,125
媽，發生什麼事了？

158
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,333
為什麼我不能再爬樹了？

159
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,958
會議主題是什麼？

160
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,125
沒什麼，莫莉

161
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,416
衹是…

162
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,875
今年樹上發現了一些大型黃蜂

163
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,583
-真的嗎？
-而且

164
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,916
我需要有人留在家

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,666
看好妳爸

166
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,500
別擔心

167
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,416
我沒事

168
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,333
好

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,708
也許他能在
妳出門的時候講故事給我聽

170
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,875
好主意

171
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,083
晚安，我勇敢的大女孩

172
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,458
晚安，金潔

173
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,416
祝妳好運

174
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,750
說吧，莫莉甜心，妳想做什麼？

175
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,250
我想你可以告訴我這個故事

176
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,458
（飛天公雞洛奇）

177
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,291
那個人…不是我

178
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,083
好吧，沒錯，就是我

179
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,416
但那是很久以前的事了

180
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,875
然後呢？

181
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,375
然後

182
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,750
其實

183
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,291
這個故事很精彩

184
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,083
他們不衹是要我們的蛋

185
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,083
金潔又露出了那個表情

186
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,458
我覺得她會讓我們衝進戰場

187
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,000
我不想衝進戰場

188
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,500
我有戰場恐懼症

189
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,416
-好了，各位，請安靜！
-她要開始了

190
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,250
-安靜
-閉上雞嘴

191
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,750
聽我說，我們都知道開了一條新路

192
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,208
也看見有貨車

193
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:47,083
把雞運到像養雞場的地方

194
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,333
養雞場？

195
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,458
別擔心，貝爾瑞

196
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,916
聽我說

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,750
根據我們的經驗

198
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,416
我們知道那代表什麼意思

199
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,791
我們不能對此視而不見

200
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,875
我們真的衹有一個選擇

201
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
我不想聽了

202
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,708
我們得採取行動

203
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,125
我們必須躲起來

204
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,833
躲起來？

205
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,708
沒錯，躲起來！

206
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,583
意思是假裝我們不在這裡？

207
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,166
沒錯

208
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,291
低調行動

209
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,291
非常好

210
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,791
我喜歡低調

211
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,333
尤其是低調直紋圖案

212
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,500
她說得沒錯

213
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,500
此事確實與我們無關

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,708
妳還好嗎？雞友

215
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,125
躲避危險不像妳的作風

216
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,708
我知道

217
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,583
但我現在得為莫莉著想

218
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,083
而且我…

219
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,333
我們不能拿自由冒險

220
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,583
進入一個覺得雞是…

221
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,458
人間美味的世界

222
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:09,958
拉起來

223
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,541
好極了！

224
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,500
我們現在衹需要保持安靜

225
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,333
別引起註意就好了

226
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,250
公雞咕咕叫！

227
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,833
洛奇

228
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,583
考慮到我們的新處境

229
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,333
也許你該停止啼叫了

230
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,208
停止啼叫？

231
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,416
但那是我的興趣

232
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,250
也許你可以換個興趣

233
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,208
安靜一點的興趣？

234
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,875
天啊，這個真棒

235
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,125
莫莉！妳別靠近那裡

236
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,916
金潔，我們能不能談談…

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,125
其實她說得沒錯

238
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,666
胡亂啼叫丟小命

239
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,458
我們必須保持低調

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,458
我會在中午開一堂偽裝課

241
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,791
前提是你要能找到我

242
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
媽媽，這是做什麼用的？

243
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,166
那是什麼？

244
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,541
有隻雞坐在桶子裡面

245
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,125
兩隻手比讚

246
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,375
太好笑了

247
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,791
我們回家吧

248
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,500
他們要去哪裡？

249
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,000
我們能一起去嗎？

250
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,333
-看起來很好玩
-對不起，莫莉

251
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,333
妳還沒準備好離開這座島

252
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,583
可是我…

253
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,458
洛奇？能幫個忙嗎？

254
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,875
也許我可以在週末啼叫，妳懂嗎？

255
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,375
為什麼我還沒準備好？

256
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,875
我是勇敢的大女孩

257
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,083
妳總是這麼說

258
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,000
我知道

259
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,708
但妳還是小孩子

260
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,166
誰說的？

261
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,375
我和妳爸說的

262
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,541
對吧？洛奇

263
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,416
對，沒錯，就是這麼回事

264
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,000
聽媽媽的話，孩子

265
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,000
我把長度減半如何？

266
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,958
像“咕咕”或“嘎嘎”？

267
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
換成短一點的

268
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,333
我要去另一頭看看那些貨車

269
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,291
因為我是獨行放山雞

270
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,166
跟爸爸以前一樣

271
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,583
我看到他的海報了

272
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,416
他以前住在另一頭，妳也是

273
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,208
是我說的嗎？我…

274
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,291
什麼都不記得了

275
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,375
夠了

276
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,875
莫莉，妳不能離開這座島

277
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,833
妳不能逼我留在這裡，我又不歸妳管

278
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,791
妳就是歸我管

279
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,666
聽著

280
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,458
莫莉，妳想要的一切都在這裡

281
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,583
除了那一樣

282
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,958
哪一樣？

283
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,083
自由

284
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,666
其實

285
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,458
她真的跟妳很像

286
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,625
妳女兒一定很美味！

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,666
說好不打臉！

288
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,625
莫莉？

289
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,250
-莫莉？
-莫莉？

290
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,916
-快出來，莫莉！
-莫莉！

291
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,250
-莫莉？
-莫莉？

292
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,541
-莫莉！
-莫莉！

293
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,041
-莫莉！
-莫莉？

294
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,083
出來吧，莫莉

295
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,208
不！

296
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,791
她離開這座島了

297
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,375
其實沒那麼糟嘛

298
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,625
我不知道媽在擔心什麼

299
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,500
我長大了

300
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,208
而且很勇敢

301
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,750
一點沒錯

302
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,250
我長大了…

303
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,791
而且

304
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,458
不是很勇敢

305
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,083
妳剛才在做什麼？

306
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,750
不想活了嗎？

307
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,083
不是

308
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,458
等等

309
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,958
不想活是什麼意思？

310
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,500
這個時間在外遊蕩

311
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,375
是不是太晚了點？小女孩

312
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,208
我才不是小女孩

313
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,750
我是勇敢的大女孩

314
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,333
而且這個時間妳也不該在外面吧？

315
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,125
很好，我喜歡

316
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,166
妳喜歡以牙還牙，是吧？

317
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,791
我叫捲毛

318
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,083
妳是？

319
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,291
莫莉

320
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,750
這名字有點好笑

321
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,416
所以我打算改叫…

322
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,458
安靜，女孩

323
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,625
它要停下來了

324
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,458
我們的機會來了

325
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,375
妳到底要不要一起來？

326
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,791
去哪裡？

327
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,916
搭上那輛快樂雞貨車

328
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,791
妳也有看到嗎？

329
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,333
對

330
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,666
不管那輛貨車要去哪裡

331
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,958
肯定都比企鵝的腳指甲更酷

332
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,958
腳指甲是什麼？

333
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,041
企鵝又是什麼？

334
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,125
妳要學的東西太多了

335
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,041
來吧

336
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,791
等等我

337
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,583
她找到我的海報

338
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,916
然後我跟她講了一個故事

339
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,291
我覺得這沒什麼大不了的

340
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,500
是啊

341
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,583
鼓勵女兒成為獨行放山雞

342
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,375
是非常合理的行為

343
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,041
若照妳的意思，她到現在都無法破殼

344
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,041
在蛋殼裡總比在大馬路上好

345
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,708
所以

346
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,666
妳也住在島上嗎？

347
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,666
不是

348
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,833
我被困在一個無聊的破雞場

349
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,208
然後貨車來了

350
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,208
他們說我還太小，不能上車

351
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,750
但這不會阻止我

352
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,666
有機會坐在桶子裡

353
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,333
哪隻雞不想要屬於自己桶子？

354
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,250
我要專屬桶子

355
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,708
小莫，我們要這麼做

356
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,458
衹要是想去的地方
不論何時，我們說走就走

357
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,875
對，誰都不能對我們指手畫腳

358
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,375
雞友，我和妳

359
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,625
我們要一路相挺

360
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,916
我的老天爺

361
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,166
聽見了嗎？

362
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,791
裡面就像在開派對一樣

363
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,666
那是什麼東西？

364
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,375
妳沒看過人類？

365
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,125
我待的雞場就有人類

366
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,083
他們有點蠢

367
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,166
他們提供我們食物，然後清潔環境

368
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,708
基本上就像服務生

369
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,250
你這傢伙

370
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,625
妳們是怎麼跑出來的？

371
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,125
怎麼樣？莫莉

372
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,541
想不想體驗這千載難逢的冒險？

373
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,375
-不好了！
-糟糕！

374
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,541
莫莉！

375
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,458
金潔！

376
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,208
莫莉！

377
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,916
我知道妳在想什麼

378
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,583
怎麼沒有桶子？

379
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,250
我肯定等到了之後就能拿到了

380
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,416
我們快到了嗎？

381
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,458
莫莉！

382
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,500
妳好

383
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,916
我的雞柳條

384
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,250
弗勒，你撐住！

385
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,666
不然我在做什麼？

386
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,125
莫莉！

387
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,625
（樂土雞場）

388
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,958
（雞的幸福結局）

389
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,791
其實看起來還不錯

390
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,333
天啊，看起來糟透了

391
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,125
好，停車

392
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,583
我們檢查一下

393
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,666
好了，沒問題

394
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,666
可以走了

395
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:10,416
（高壓電）

396
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,166
我們絕對不能慌

397
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,083
-沒錯，別慌！
-我不喜歡

398
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,166
這是最該慌張的時候

399
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,625
因為敵人佔了上風

400
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,208
我們必須讓腦袋保持冷靜！

401
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,666
腦袋要放哪裡才能冷靜？

402
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,958
我在想辦法

403
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,583
不許慌，不可以，我說不許慌張！

404
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,500
金潔

405
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,750
-妳覺得呢？
-我是怎麼說的？

406
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,250
我覺得

407
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,833
上次我們從養雞場逃出來

408
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,458
這一次

409
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,541
我們要闖進去

410
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,833
-有臭臭的味道
-跟我想像中不一樣

411
00:23:58,916 --> 00:23:59,833
這裡…

412
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,250
很酷

413
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,208
對吧？

414
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,666
就是這樣，可愛的小雞

415
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,250
全都下去吧

416
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,958
那個我不喜歡，跟我來

417
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:25,916
從這裡

418
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,333
-天啊
-天啊

419
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:02,291
我不是說過會有千載難逢的冒險嗎？

420
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,375
走吧

421
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,916
我們去玩

422
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,041
好耶

423
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,708
我們去泳池玩水吧

424
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,416
大家聽我說

425
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,708
我們一定沒問題

426
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,958
衹要想出一個妙計就好

427
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,291
好，這個交給我

428
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,666
我會進去裡面

429
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,333
並且把莫莉救出來

430
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,791
你要用什麼方法把她救出來？

431
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,916
這個嘛，我要…

432
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,375
就是…

433
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,500
進去裡面

434
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,416
然後

435
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
把她救出來

436
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,958
這算哪門子的計畫？

437
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,083
你衹是說出願望而已

438
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,958
對，若是你不瞭解規則

439
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,166
十二條鯡魚和一支風笛根本說不通

440
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,375
我覺得妳這番話聽起來有點消極

441
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,250
麥兒說得對，我們需要更多細節

442
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,625
機會衹有一次

443
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,416
我們的一舉一動

444
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,291
都必須經過深思熟慮

445
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,375
我們不能直接衝進去…

446
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:07,625
洛奇？

447
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,583
你在做什麼？

448
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,958
有時候得放手一搏，金潔

449
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:16,291
-準備好了嗎？弗勒
-準備好了

450
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,000
-發射
-洛奇

451
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,416
公雞咕咕…

452
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,083
一切都很順利

453
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:43,791
這個嘛

454
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,333
往好的方面想

455
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,791
至少現在我們掌握細節了

456
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,916
好

457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,416
看來我們需要支援

458
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,041
不可能

459
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,416
那個地方根本是銅牆鐵壁

460
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,125
對，而且根本進不去

461
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,750
這是不可能的任務

462
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,791
不是任務不可能嗎？

463
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,541
你別像個笨蛋一樣，費奇

464
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,166
聽著，我知道看起來機會渺茫

465
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,750
不過我們知道工廠格局

466
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,458
而且麥兒覺得有方法能進去

467
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,916
這就是樂土雞場

468
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,833
我沒想到這麼小

469
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,000
謝了，貝絲

470
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,375
在盲點區

471
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,250
有一扇小門

472
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,375
要用無恥的小把戲才能開啟

473
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,250
所以

474
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,375
我們衹需要穿過電圍欄

475
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,500
通過所有警衛

476
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:38,750
攝影機驅動的持槍鼴鼠

477
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,916
還有雷射導引的爆炸鴨子

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,625
拜託，你們一定要幫幫我們

479
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,583
洛奇在裡面

480
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,125
真是可惜了，我挺喜歡他的

481
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,833
莫莉也在裡面

482
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,541
莫莉？我們的小侄女？

483
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,833
冷靜點，夥計

484
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,208
你要堅強

485
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,416
不！

486
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:01,916
-你們答應了嗎？
-說吧

487
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,666
妳要我們做什麼

488
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,875
我們願意為小莫莉赴湯蹈火

489
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,666
各位，我們一定能辦到

490
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,958
巴蒂

491
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,083
親愛的，有妳大塊雞

492
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,083
我們能成就大事

493
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,666
麥兒，妳是高材雞

494
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,500
貝絲，妳是

495
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,208
打毛線雞

496
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,291
尼克和費奇

497
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:26,500
你們是約克郡谷地最狡猾的小壞蛋

498
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,916
-妳人真好
-過獎了

499
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,166
還有弗勒，有了你的智慧和警覺心…

500
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,541
弗勒？

501
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,375
然後…

502
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,125
第二波炸彈攻擊接近目標

503
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,083
那就是我出場的時候

504
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,375
其實，弗勒

505
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,375
我們得讓你負責特別任務

506
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:52,791
好

507
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,375
你覺得…

508
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,500
偵察雞如何？

509
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,041
偵察雞嗎？

510
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,208
聽起來很重要

511
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,625
-我喜歡
-好

512
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,333
帶著需要的東西

513
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,333
動作要快

514
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,375
不知道莫莉在裡面的處境有多駭人

515
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,916
這裡太好玩了

516
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,333
是史上最讚的地方

517
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,583
我媽說，我們住的地方才是最讚的

518
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:26,541
最好是

519
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,375
妳住的地方有棉花糖地板嗎？

520
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,791
妳能在上面狂跳嗎？

521
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:32,875
不行

522
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,666
路面都是泥土

523
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,375
妳能整天躺著什麼都不做嗎？

524
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,250
這個…我爸可以

525
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,166
在這裡大家都可以

526
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,208
天啊

527
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,000
我聽說過這個東西

528
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,208
但我不知道它真的存在

529
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,250
酷耶

530
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,166
這是什麼？

531
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,000
吃到飽自助餐

532
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,291
比企鵝的腳趾甲更酷

533
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,708
對吧？

534
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,291
衹是我在家有工作要做

535
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,333
我幫麥兒採収作物

536
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,958
幫巴蒂挑選胡蘿蔔

537
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:19,916
跟貝絲一起織毛線

538
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
但在這裡我衹要玩就好

539
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,166
而且根本玩不完

540
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,833
不知道他們有沒有想我

541
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,583
是不是很棒？

542
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,291
我們可以隨心所欲

543
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,208
來吧

544
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,500
抱歉

545
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,583
捲毛！

546
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:34,333
這個地方有點怪怪的

547
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,375
我同意

548
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,416
妳有看過這種東西嗎？

549
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,708
不好了，這是怎麼回事？

550
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,875
妳不該走到後面去

551
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,291
妳的編號是…

552
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,833
妳沒有編號

553
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:08,458
我們不希望有小雞在這裡惹麻煩

554
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,500
特別是今天

555
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,625
（吸盤槍）

556
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:45,875
好了，各位

557
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,791
我們上吧

558
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,208
不用了

559
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,666
出發前我已經上過了

560
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:31,583
這是…

561
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,958
你這個笨蛋

562
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,541
照片上下顛倒了

563
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,250
對喔

564
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,875
動作快！

565
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,333
請說

566
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,875
沒有異常

567
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,041
行動

568
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,125
完美降落

569
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,416
跟按開關一樣精準

570
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,791
按開關？

571
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,375
好吧

572
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,583
讓我出去！

573
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,125
相機

574
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,291
我去拿

575
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,916
（員工眼書）

576
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,833
（夜班葛蘭，東尼）

577
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,125
她說我是偵察雞

578
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,750
但卻更像是兩隻老鼠的計程車司機

579
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,416
到了，完美降落

580
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,125
稍息，大兵

581
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,125
我知道他們覺得我太老

582
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,125
不適合這種勾當

583
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,583
覺得我是容易分心，愛閒晃的老公雞

584
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,750
其實

585
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,791
關於這一點，有個很有趣的故事

586
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,916
有一次，我在外四處閒晃…

587
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,041
是參加演習才對，然後…

588
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:23,833
好

589
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:25,625
我進來了

590
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,000
從我身上下來

591
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,750
尼克

592
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,833
我不想讓你擔心，可是…

593
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,833
剛才你的屁屁好像說話了

594
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,208
是你們？你們在這裡做什麼？

595
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,125
-洛奇
-洛奇

596
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:50,125
我們跟金潔一起，是來救你的

597
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,083
救我？

598
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,375
不對，是我來救人

599
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,166
要人救的不是我

600
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:58,708
是我來救莫莉出去

601
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,583
還順利嗎？

602
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,125
這個嘛…

603
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,333
聽著，你們別誤會

604
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:10,083
不過你們真的衹會拖累我

605
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,125
我喜歡獨自行動

606
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,166
是嗎？

607
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,333
是的，我是獨行放山雞

608
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,291
對吧？

609
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,375
我很接近目標了

610
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,083
我能感覺到

611
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,958
我興奮到身體發熱了

612
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,875
其實真的挺熱的

613
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,958
有人聞到烤雞香嗎？

614
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,000
就說你們會拖累我吧！

615
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,666
天啊

616
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,041
其實這在我們的計畫中

617
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,083
有嗎？

618
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,250
好，我得去找莫莉

619
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,333
莫莉？

620
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:10,916
忍住，小子

621
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,250
別激動

622
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,791
看看他們

623
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,250
感覺他們都有點…

624
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,708
無腦

625
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,666
我不喜歡這個地方

626
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,791
是啊

627
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:30,958
沒有海報看起來那麼好玩吧？

628
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,041
捲毛

629
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:36,250
也許我們該找出這裡的陰謀

630
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:40,875
這聽起來才像真正的冒險

631
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:41,916
走吧

632
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,833
我們開始調查

633
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:13,333
過來，妳這淘氣的小東西

634
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:17,458
我是一心希望妳快樂的大雞友

635
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,791
捲毛！

636
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:32,666
那是什麼東西？

637
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:38,833
妳好

638
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,208
妳是誰？

639
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,916
什麼？

640
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,833
是我啊

641
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,333
我是莫莉

642
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,375
很高興認識妳

643
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,500
捲毛

644
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,708
這是什麼東西？

645
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,041
來吧，捲毛

646
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,458
我們得走了

647
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,750
可是我從來沒有這麼快樂過

648
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,250
不

649
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,666
我長大了

650
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,583
而且很勇敢

651
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,041
捲毛

652
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,041
聽我說

653
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,000
我會找出這裡的真相

654
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,666
等事成之後再回來救妳

655
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,291
我保證

656
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:18,750
油炸博士

657
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:21,000
客人已經到了

658
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,541
蘭食洛爵士

659
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,541
好

660
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,833
輪到我大展身手了

661
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,416
（麵包屑）

662
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,250
蘭食洛爵士，歡迎

663
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,458
有爵士大駕光臨是我們的榮幸

664
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:46,250
其實蘭食洛爵士是餐廳的名字

665
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,333
我的名字是…

666
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,166
樂土雞場的主旨是

667
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,208
盡全力讓雞有在家的感覺

668
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,000
我得說，油炸博士
我從沒見過這樣的養雞場

669
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,625
這些安全措施真的有必要嗎？

670
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,750
當然了

671
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,666
莫莉

672
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,083
在這扇門後面

673
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:25,583
隱藏著徹底改變家禽科技界的秘密

674
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,666
我們走

675
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:32,375
不！

676
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,250
你們在做什麼？

677
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,458
-攻擊！
-攻擊！

678
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,625
這裡跟迷宮一樣

679
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,375
我要怎麼找到莫莉？

680
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:54,750
她就在那裡

681
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,125
莫莉？

682
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,375
莫莉！

683
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:09,458
餐廳生意好嗎？

684
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,166
其實有點不如預期

685
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:15,458
這我們應該能幫上忙

686
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:16,791
莫莉！

687
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,208
不要

688
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,416
莫莉…

689
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,166
金潔？

690
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,833
好

691
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:41,333
我要爬上去

692
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,000
我們不能搭電梯嗎？

693
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,166
我得說，油炸博士

694
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,458
這裡最好能提供…

695
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,083
優質服務

696
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,541
我的夥伴馬上就到

697
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:58,958
在此同時

698
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:03,666
我們準備了短短的簡報

699
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,208
你請坐

700
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,791
（樂土雞場為你呈現）

701
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,416
這是一隻普通的雞

702
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,916
平淡、無聊

703
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,500
而且容易受驚

704
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,416
跟頭腦簡單的動物一樣

705
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,958
牠們面對加工過程的本能反應

706
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,041
是恐懼與驚慌

707
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,541
在這種情況下，肌肉會變得緊繃

708
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:55,291
導致結締組織打結

709
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,500
結果是什麼？

710
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,208
雞肉變得很硬

711
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:01,583
口感乾柴而且沒有風味

712
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,041
媽咪，這塊肉好硬、乾柴又沒風味

713
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,458
我討厭妳，媽咪

714
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:10,708
莫莉

715
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:13,208
沒人感謝的母親，不用擔心

716
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,208
若是科學能改變這一切呢？

717
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:20,625
若是科學能夠改變
雞對恐懼的反應呢？

718
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:26,875
若是有辦法讓雞樂於接受加工呢？

719
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,708
那你會說：“幹得好，科學”

720
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,250
因為快樂的雞

721
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,791
美味無比

722
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,875
這是全世界最美味的雞肉

723
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,750
我愛妳，媽咪

724
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,416
感謝科學

725
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,416
（樂土雞場）

726
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,666
莫莉

727
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,000
油炸博士，這段卡通畫得真好

728
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,708
不過你們真能辦到嗎？

729
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,916
我們已經辦到了

730
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:06,625
那個聲音

731
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:30,208
容我介紹我的妻子

732
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:35,333
梅莉莎敦蒂

733
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,166
歡迎進入未來

734
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,250
是她

735
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:52,541
親愛的，這位是蘭食洛爵士

736
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,333
我叫雷吉諾史密斯

737
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:58,208
蘭食洛爵士是連鎖餐廳的名字

738
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,041
你好，雷吉諾

739
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,541
你已經見過我的現任丈夫

740
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,666
油炸博士了

741
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,666
我是被他的巨額遺產
和寬闊土地所吸引嗎？

742
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:13,208
不是

743
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,458
是他的聰明才智

744
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:18,416
雖然你可能看不出來

745
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,666
但他是個天才

746
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,375
妳太誇獎我了，老婆

747
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:25,500
他擁有牛津和劍橋大學學位

748
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:26,708
主修臨床神經學

749
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,625
行為心理學

750
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,541
基因工程

751
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,750
和戲劇

752
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,458
你開胃菜吃完了

753
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,333
是時候上主菜了

754
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:43,666
來吧

755
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,250
莫莉，不要

756
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:51,291
退後

757
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:53,833
放開我

758
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,708
好，試試能不能找到莫莉

759
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,958
妳們看

760
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,750
洛奇和兩隻老鼠上電視了

761
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:05,041
看起來真是命懸一線

762
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,958
她在哪裡？

763
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,208
你看

764
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,583
牠們喜歡新的蛋杯遊樂設施

765
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,541
捲毛

766
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:31,375
媽？

767
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,000
莫莉寶貝

768
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,291
-妳沒事吧？
-沒事

769
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,000
跟我保證妳再也不亂跑

770
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,458
-他們有傷害妳嗎？
-我沒事，但我想他們會吃…

771
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:39,708
快啊

772
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:40,750
繼續介紹

773
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,666
妳說得沒錯，甜心

774
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,708
請看

775
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,208
這偉大的遙控器

776
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,750
還有另外兩個

777
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:55,000
遙控器

778
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,625
為什麼要三個？

779
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,416
沒人知道

780
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,833
我們先從

781
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,541
那裡開始

782
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,375
-我幹嘛打高爾夫球？
-這是哪裡？

783
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:12,875
-我在做什麼？
-莫莉？

784
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:14,541
莫莉，妳在哪裡？

785
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,375
怎麼回事？

786
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:17,666
沒有問題

787
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,083
衹是按錯而已，我的天使

788
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,875
那個是關閉鈕

789
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,708
讓我來

790
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,333
是我

791
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:49,208
她中獎了

792
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,416
真棒

793
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,166
真是幸運雞

794
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,333
不，住手

795
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:08,708
快跑，小雞，快跑！

796
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,333
再見

797
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,833
祝妳愉快

798
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,666
看著我

799
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,166
別移開視線

800
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,458
看啊

801
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,541
這就是雞塊新世代

802
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,375
我愛妳，媽咪

803
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:52,000
我是說雞塊很好吃

804
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,583
你想像一下

805
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:56,583
在每個城鎮的大街小巷

806
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,250
人們忙忙碌碌

807
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:01,125
生活在現代世界的現代人

808
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:04,041
他們想要快點拿到美食

809
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:08,291
我們會一桶一桶供應

810
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,625
速食

811
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,000
我喜歡，這可能會紅

812
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:16,916
不對

813
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,916
這會造成轟動

814
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,291
而且梅莉莎敦蒂會成功復仇

815
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,125
復仇？

816
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,291
富有

817
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:32,125
我是說富有

818
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:36,833
明天黎明我會派貨車來収第一批雞塊

819
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:41,125
我的雞塊跟你的連鎖餐廳攜手合作

820
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:44,583
肯定是合作無間

821
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,708
要我送你上車嗎？爵士

822
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:53,833
快點

823
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,125
我們離開這裡

824
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,291
等一下

825
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:57,541
我們不能丟下捲毛

826
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:58,458
捲毛？

827
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,125
捲毛是誰？

828
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,625
她是我的朋友，我不能丟下她不管

829
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:03,875
我承諾會回去救她

830
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:04,958
拜託，莫莉

831
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,166
妳不懂

832
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,583
但妳見到發生什麼事了，她會沒命的

833
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:11,708
若現在不離開，我們也必死無疑

834
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:13,791
我不管，我不會把她留在這裡

835
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:15,000
妳衹是小孩子

836
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:17,500
根本不知道敵人有多厲害

837
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:24,333
掰掰

838
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,375
是妳

839
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:35,625
給我過來！

840
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,750
抓到了吧

841
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,916
小小逃脫大師

842
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:54,500
我不會讓妳毀了這一切

843
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:55,416
絕不重蹈覆轍

844
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,458
博士，你立刻回來

845
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:00,333
順便拿個項圈過來

846
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:03,333
雞場來了一位意外訪客

847
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,458
站住

848
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,125
你快讓我們累死了，朋友

849
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,750
我上次累成這樣

850
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:20,125
已經是試跑倉鼠風火輪的時候

851
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,166
總算被我抓到了

852
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,416
安靜，你們聽

853
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,375
那隻逃出敦蒂雞場的

854
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,583
可悲又愛抱怨的小雞

855
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:30,333
就是牠毀了我的人生

856
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,250
這到底是什麼鳥地方？

857
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,208
莫莉，妳在哪裡？

858
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,541
他把我織的布撐開了

859
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,833
快跑！

860
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,291
我滿足妳身為母雞的所有需求

861
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,708
有溫暖的雞舍

862
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:03,208
提供妳不限量的飼料

863
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,416
可是妳還是不快樂

864
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:09,916
現在我要讓妳快樂

865
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:18,875
媽

866
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,375
我必須進去

867
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:23,541
我有個主意

868
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,791
你是獨行放山雞，對吧？

869
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,125
對

870
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,708
你有被大砲射出去過吧？

871
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,583
那是…這有什麼關係嗎？

872
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:36,875
沒有用

873
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,208
加強功率

874
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,083
設備運作正常，親愛的

875
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,833
我從沒見過意志如此堅強的雞

876
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,583
是你孤陋寡聞

877
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,833
把功率調到最大

878
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,083
調到最大？

879
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,958
但我們從來沒有測試過

880
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:56,041
難道凡事都要我親自動手嗎？

881
00:57:56,541 --> 00:58:00,625
丈夫和雞是我人生的禍根

882
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,750
你確定這樣可行嗎？

883
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:28,833
確定，費奇是電工專家

884
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,375
他還沒學會走路就會咬電線了

885
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,500
-好了
-做得好，兩位

886
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,041
我準備起飛了

887
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,041
再見，兄弟

888
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,875
或是該說

889
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:40,791
永別了

890
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,208
老實說，這樣說更像道別

891
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:02,041
走吧

892
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,250
走吧，媽

893
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,416
媽？

894
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,625
妳在叫誰？

895
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:10,875
叫妳啊

896
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,083
我們必須逃出去

897
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:14,250
為什麼？

898
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,208
我好喜歡這裡

899
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,541
我好快樂

900
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,833
不好了

901
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:27,375
爸？

902
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,000
莫莉

903
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:38,916
好吧

904
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:54,041
牠舞跳得真好

905
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,666
媽，等等

906
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:04,916
我們不會飛，我們是雞

907
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:11,625
抓住牠

908
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,625
給我過來

909
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:18,791
抓住牠

910
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:33,291
把那幾隻雞找出來

911
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,375
我快樂無比！

912
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,958
我快樂無比

913
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,291
我知道我快樂！

914
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,916
我是真的快樂！

915
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,958
我快樂無比！

916
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:48,583
-一起來！
-安靜，媽

917
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:49,708
我們得安靜

918
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,000
可是我想唱歌！

919
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:53,916
跟我走就對了

920
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,291
好耶

921
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,125
我們要去度假嗎？

922
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:59,375
不是，我們得找到捲毛和爸爸

923
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:00,791
然後離開這裡

924
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,250
可是為什麼？

925
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,625
因為我說了算

926
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:09,625
我又不歸妳管

927
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,583
我能看見自己的腳

928
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:13,750
牠們去哪裡了？

929
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,291
-來吧，媽
-拜託！

930
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,333
往這裡

931
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:21,708
等等我

932
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,708
快點，我們得加快速度

933
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:33,166
金潔，感謝老天妳逃走了

934
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,458
我們竟然又要對付那個老妖婆

935
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:37,541
什麼？

936
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,750
敦蒂太太最棒了

937
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,375
-我愛她
-巴蒂

938
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,458
-麥兒，是項圈的關係
-她是最討人喜歡

939
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:45,625
-這讓媽變得怪怪的
-最優秀的女子

940
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:46,833
-莫莉！
-莫莉！

941
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,000
-打昏他了
-尼克叔叔？

942
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,458
費奇叔叔

943
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:09,291
你們是怎麼找到我們的？

944
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,166
-我們衹是從通風口掉下來…
-因為愛，莫莉

945
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,375
是愛指引我們道路

946
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,166
電梯向上

947
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:17,875
-掰掰
-金潔

948
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:18,833
媽！

949
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,125
我快樂無比

950
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,500
我知道我快樂

951
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,458
-我是真的快樂
-拿不下來

952
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,791
-我快樂無比
-貝絲，妳包包裡有什麼？

953
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,875
恐怕沒什麼能用的

954
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:36,625
好極了

955
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:37,875
就是這個

956
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:41,625
好癢

957
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:55,750
感覺好像在一個巨大餅乾罐裡

958
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,875
衹是沒有餅乾

959
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,458
我的眼鏡不見了

960
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,500
什麼都看不見

961
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,125
媽？

962
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:06,125
媽！

963
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,291
莫莉？

964
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,375
妳沒事

965
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,458
我的莫莉

966
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:21,416
發生什麼事了？

967
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:22,875
這是什麼地方？

968
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:24,875
不知道

969
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,291
但是沒有出口

970
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,416
天無絕雞之路

971
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:31,875
洛奇人呢？

972
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,708
我在那個大房間有看到他

973
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,541
是他救了我們

974
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,000
真的嗎？

975
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:49,833
加油

976
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:51,708
這次我們一定能辦到

977
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:54,666
我撐不了多久了

978
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,500
費奇，快一點

979
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,041
找個能抓住的突出物或裂縫

980
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,083
沒問題

981
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:02,500
不是那個裂縫

982
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,750
面對事實吧，雞友們

983
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,291
我們要等奇蹟發生才能離開這裡

984
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:16,875
下面有人嗎？

985
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,041
-爸！
-洛奇

986
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:20,750
別告訴我他就是我們的奇蹟

987
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,041
他這個人超難相處

988
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,166
交給洛奇就對了

989
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,500
-不！別跳！
-不！別跳下來！

990
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,416
什麼？你們說什麼？

991
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,833
我聽不清楚

992
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,208
等等，我這就下去

993
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:32,458
別跳！

994
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,708
家人抱抱

995
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,625
我好想妳們

996
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:46,541
好，我們炸了這座養雞場然後回家去

997
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,291
剛才那裡就是出口，對吧？

998
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:01,125
我真的很抱歉

999
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:11,333
莫莉

1000
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:12,583
妳怎麼了？

1001
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,333
這全是我的錯

1002
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:18,666
我應該聽妳的話，照妳說的做

1003
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,958
現在全搞砸了

1004
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,208
我勇敢的大女孩到哪裡去了？

1005
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:31,791
那個女孩是笨蛋

1006
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,000
妳說得沒錯

1007
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:37,333
若我們能回家，我會待在那裡不離開

1008
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:38,875
一輩子不離開

1009
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:40,958
不對，莫莉

1010
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:42,791
錯的人是我

1011
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:45,958
我不該告訴妳

1012
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:48,958
荒謬的獨行放山雞故事

1013
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:51,208
不

1014
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,666
錯的人是我

1015
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:55,791
以前的我痛恨被關起來

1016
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,083
妳的個性當然會跟我一樣

1017
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,875
我應該是擔心妳太像我了

1018
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:06,333
像妳有什麼不好？

1019
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,083
沒有不好

1020
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,791
因為妳媽媽是最棒的

1021
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:17,333
而且

1022
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:19,083
她總是有妙計

1023
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,916
這次沒有

1024
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:25,583
他來了

1025
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,708
準備好炸雞了嗎？油炸先生

1026
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,375
再五分鐘，甜心

1027
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,125
給你四分鐘

1028
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:35,416
牠在哪裡？

1029
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:41,083
那些落跑雞困在玉米筒倉裡了

1030
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,583
你說在筒倉裡？

1031
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,458
好極了

1032
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:47,166
我來會會這幾位客人

1033
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,416
三分鐘後開始生產

1034
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,458
三分鐘？

1035
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:55,041
小雞們，看來你們的好運用完了

1036
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,750
（玉米筒倉研磨機）

1037
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,666
我想這下面有一個研磨機

1038
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,625
但往好處想，我們在磨成碎片之前

1039
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,666
應該會先被玉米淹死

1040
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,083
等一下…

1041
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:21,916
爆米花

1042
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:23,666
爆米花，大家快看

1043
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,791
是爆米花

1044
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,250
洛奇，我覺得現在不適合…

1045
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:36,583
人生所有難題的答案

1046
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:37,708
沒錯

1047
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:38,750
麥兒

1048
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:39,916
我們需要熱量

1049
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,916
超熱的那種

1050
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,333
這個夠嗎？

1051
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:45,541
完美

1052
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:48,541
誰有火柴？

1053
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,000
衹有你跟真正的瘋子才會帶火柴

1054
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:52,875
你會把我們炸成碎片的

1055
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:57,500
更何況

1056
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,625
最後一根已經用掉了

1057
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,166
不會吧

1058
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,375
我女兒真聰明

1059
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:20,041
我能再次提出健康安全擔憂嗎？

1060
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:21,458
是什麼？

1061
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:29,875
好

1062
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,541
真好吃

1063
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,000
還有嗎？

1064
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,125
但你知道嗎？

1065
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:56,000
就在威茲班查理
以為我們已經回英國的時候

1066
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:58,083
敵軍從六點鐘方向開火

1067
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,041
天啊

1068
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:01,791
天下爆米花雨嗎？

1069
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,958
英國天氣就是這樣難以預測

1070
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,583
永遠不知道會有什麼從天而降

1071
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,000
太離譜了

1072
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,125
-做得好！
-我們逃出來了

1073
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,458
你們看

1074
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:29,541
弗勒竟然為我們拉好了逃生路線

1075
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:34,375
幹得好，你這個老傢伙

1076
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,791
用力握個手就行了，謝謝

1077
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,166
任務完成

1078
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,708
我們趕緊逃離這座瘋狂雞場吧？

1079
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,208
沒錯

1080
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,666
尼克，你看

1081
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,333
我們有準備回家路上的點心嗎？

1082
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:05,250
好，可以進去了

1083
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,250
金潔，妳不走嗎？

1084
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,375
我不走

1085
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,291
我要回去

1086
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,333
為了捲毛？

1087
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,041
為了捲毛

1088
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:31,250
以及所有的雞友

1089
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,916
太好了

1090
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:42,083
雖然住的地方與世隔絕

1091
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,375
但我們不是與世隔絕的雞

1092
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,833
沒有雞是一座孤島

1093
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,166
我們跟妳同進退，金潔

1094
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,125
對，我也是

1095
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,583
我排第四

1096
01:10:58,666 --> 01:10:59,708
老鼠也加入

1097
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,833
好，媽，妳有什麼計畫？

1098
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:08,541
我沒想到妳…

1099
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:10,583
洛奇

1100
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,916
莫莉

1101
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:15,750
妳確定準備好了嗎？

1102
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,125
我一孵出來就準備好了，爸

1103
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,666
她跟我好像

1104
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,583
油炸博士

1105
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:36,041
屋頂的噪動是怎麼回事？

1106
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,041
聽起來像是爆炸聲

1107
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:42,041
看來有一個筒倉炸開了

1108
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,458
也許妳不該把那些雞

1109
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,500
丟進研磨機裡，親愛的

1110
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,208
別說蠢話了

1111
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:50,500
梅莉莎

1112
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:52,500
準備好迎接大日子了嗎？

1113
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:56,333
當然了，雷吉納

1114
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,208
一切都沒問題

1115
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:01,041
非常好，我的貨車可以上貨了

1116
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,875
我們得加緊腳步

1117
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,166
趁敦蒂忙著在外面接待客人

1118
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,250
我們偷偷溜進去

1119
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,500
莫莉，妳帶巴蒂、貝絲和麥兒

1120
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:10,916
到雞友聚集的地方

1121
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,083
來吧

1122
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:13,541
往這裡

1123
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:15,750
別被人看見

1124
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,666
準備好阻止雞友們走上樓梯

1125
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,333
洛奇

1126
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,833
我們得按下那個按鈕

1127
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,541
解除項圈的控制

1128
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,125
等項圈一解除

1129
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,083
莫莉組就帶領大家離開

1130
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,958
我們衝出大門

1131
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:36,208
偷走貨車

1132
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,958
就可以平安回家了

1133
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,208
那麼我們還等什麼？

1134
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:43,375
-動手吧
-是今天行動吧？

1135
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,291
我講到哪裡了？對

1136
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,666
威茲班查理沒了起落架

1137
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,458
加上那架破飛機著了火…

1138
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:54,833
說實話，梅莉莎

1139
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:57,583
我為我們的大日子準備了一份小禮

1140
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,250
天啊，雷吉納

1141
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,500
這一切太突然了

1142
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:06,041
番茄醬？

1143
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:07,583
不是

1144
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,666
這是全新產品

1145
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,208
我取名為

1146
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:12,833
“沾醬”

1147
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:19,666
這味道甜甜的

1148
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,125
又酸酸的

1149
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:25,041
我們不都是如此嗎？雷吉諾

1150
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,500
油炸博士？

1151
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,041
什麼事？親愛的

1152
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:33,708
說些我愛聽的話吧

1153
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:36,000
快點行動，北七

1154
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,708
（全體雞隻）

1155
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:51,833
是搞笑雞

1156
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,583
還有紅毛雞

1157
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,333
糟糕，我老婆會不高興的

1158
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,791
快過來，你們兩隻淘氣小雞！

1159
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:14,666
這下糟了

1160
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,750
我們另個世界見，蛋頭男

1161
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:18,458
妳懂我的梗嗎？

1162
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,500
油炸博士？

1163
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:21,000
上面發生什麼事了？

1164
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:22,708
快，我們走

1165
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:26,041
油炸博士！

1166
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,833
-有人嗎？
-油炸博士！

1167
01:14:27,916 --> 01:14:29,875
-有人在嗎？
-油炸博士！

1168
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:31,875
油炸博士！

1169
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,333
我的雞塊呢？

1170
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:38,041
那傢伙真是沒用，就像一隻無頭…

1171
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,291
雞！

1172
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,375
我們來做雞塊吧

1173
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,625
不好了

1174
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:17,083
糟了，情況不妙，麥兒

1175
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,500
捲毛，妳在哪裡？

1176
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,833
輪到我了

1177
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:28,583
再見

1178
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,541
捲毛！

1179
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:34,250
美麗的陽光…

1180
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:36,458
-等等
-把她抓好

1181
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:41,583
麥兒，快點

1182
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,875
我拿到了

1183
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:53,333
我弄掉了！

1184
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,833
洛奇

1185
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:10,708
衝啊！金潔

1186
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:21,291
我們準備過暑假

1187
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,541
一、兩週內不再工作

1188
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:24,958
大家一起來

1189
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,791
我們要去度假了

1190
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,250
不對，貝絲

1191
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,958
他們會把所有雞都變成雞塊

1192
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:38,458
我們要去陽光明媚的地方

1193
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:39,916
現在不是跳舞的時候，夥計

1194
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:45,750
拜託妳，麥兒，快一點

1195
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:46,875
就快好了

1196
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:50,541
衹要再插個幾下…

1197
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:54,291
發生什麼事了？

1198
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,916
這是怎麼回事？

1199
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,083
捲毛，這裡不是最棒的地方

1200
01:16:58,166 --> 01:17:01,416
我們要等到
被切塊煮熟後才會有專屬桶子

1201
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:07,250
妳為了我回來？

1202
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:08,833
那還用說

1203
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,000
雞友，我和妳

1204
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:12,250
我們要一路相挺

1205
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,250
該走了！

1206
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:21,666
試著把他們推回去！

1207
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,208
數量太多了

1208
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:28,333
這也是其中一項設施嗎？

1209
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,541
媽！

1210
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:09,125
金潔！

1211
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:17,875
快看

1212
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,250
桶子都在那裡

1213
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:23,875
是那個按鈕！

1214
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:26,958
就是這樣

1215
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,416
捲毛，妳站在巴蒂的肩膀上

1216
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,416
什麼？

1217
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:32,375
相信我

1218
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,625
上去吧

1219
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:43,833
莫莉，祝妳順利

1220
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:45,083
加油，莫莉！

1221
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:05,958
莫莉？

1222
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,541
這裡交給我，你去幫媽媽

1223
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:22,625
莫莉，小心

1224
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,250
看看這位是誰？

1225
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,125
是縮小版的妳

1226
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:35,791
媽，接住

1227
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,541
媽，他們要掉下去了！

1228
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,666
金潔，我們擋不住他們！

1229
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,666
媽，不能再等了

1230
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,125
快按下去！

1231
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:10,875
有時候

1232
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,666
得放手一搏

1233
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:21,125
不！

1234
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:24,833
公雞咕咕叫！

1235
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,125
不可以！

1236
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,416
金潔！

1237
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:58,291
我抓住妳了

1238
01:20:58,375 --> 01:20:59,416
我抓住妳了

1239
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,625
現在

1240
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:07,083
我想你們三隻剛好夠一桶的量

1241
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,625
再見

1242
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,833
再也不見

1243
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,625
（危險，超巨雞）

1244
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,125
快走

1245
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,458
怎麼這麼久？

1246
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:46,708
還敢說是速食

1247
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:52,375
有意思

1248
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:53,291
聽起來像…

1249
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:55,375
群雞逃竄！

1250
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,500
-動作快
-快點動起來

1251
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:59,166
-大家都上車
-快點！

1252
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,958
你真的知道怎麼開嗎？

1253
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,208
知道

1254
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:06,791
油門、煞車

1255
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:07,791
和備用腳踏？

1256
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,541
快，我們得走了

1257
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,958
全速前進！

1258
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:14,583
錯邊了

1259
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,958
你用哪一檔？

1260
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:17,750
我這身搭配是“魅力無法擋”

1261
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:27,958
妳呀！

1262
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:31,625
怎麼會有這麼離譜的養雞場？

1263
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,500
梅莉莎？

1264
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,291
妳怎麼穿得跟雞塊一樣？

1265
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:46,166
出口就在前面

1266
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:52,958
把她甩下去！

1267
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:00,583
（橋樑控制區）

1268
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:10,708
我想他們需要更大的桶子

1269
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:23,083
起飛了！

1270
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:45,458
偵察雞弗勒

1271
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:47,208
前來報到

1272
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:49,708
弗勒，我們沒有你該怎麼辦？

1273
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,833
親愛的！

1274
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,166
親愛的！

1275
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:00,041
生產線嚴重過熱

1276
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:11,583
甜心，妳要小心…

1277
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,541
-可惡
-怎麼了？

1278
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,833
我好像把傘留在雞場了

1279
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:56,791
最棒的假期就是回家，對不對？

1280
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:00,583
對，可不是嗎？貝絲

1281
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,666
修好了

1282
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,333
衹是有一根螺絲鬆了

1283
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,750
能有幾桶爆米花真不錯

1284
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:14,708
這樣就不怕肚子餓了

1285
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:16,458
大家都有份

1286
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,625
聽說這個項圈
能讓你變得快樂又無腦

1287
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,833
是耶，我感覺到了

1288
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:24,708
這感覺太棒了

1289
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:27,291
夥計，我還沒打開

1290
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:34,541
看來我們終於有了幸福結局

1291
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,125
就當作是幸福的開端吧

1292
01:25:44,166 --> 01:25:46,875
莫莉中士，偵察區報告

1293
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,875
北邊的養雞場

1294
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:51,041
30隻雞關在一個籠子裡

1295
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:52,416
可憐的雞友

1296
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,250
聽著，各位

1297
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:04,041
我不喜歡這樣

1298
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,083
該行動了

1299
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,500
不過我有一個問題

1300
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,708
我可以繼續啼叫了嗎？

1301
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,291
那當然了

1302
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:13,875
大家準備好了嗎？

1303
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:16,541
-準備好了！
-準備好了！

1304
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:19,333
公雞咕咕叫！

1305
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:30,458
（緬懷莫里斯摩根）
