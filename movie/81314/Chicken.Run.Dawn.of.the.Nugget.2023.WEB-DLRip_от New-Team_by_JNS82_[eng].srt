-[Fowler] She's right, you know.

-Careless squawks cost lives.

317
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,458
We have to lie low.

318
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.

319
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
If you can find me.

320
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,791
-[Fowler yelps]
-[hens] Ooh.

321
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,583
[Molly] What's it for, Mum?

322
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,583
[chickens clucking inside truck]

323
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,166
[gasps] Oh! What is that?

324
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,916
[chickens clucking loudly]

325
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,500
It's got a chicken sitting
in a bucket on it.

326
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,333
It's doing this.

327
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,375
[giggles] Oh, that's so funny.

328
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,791
Uh, let's go home.

329
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,666
[Molly sighs]

330
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,458
[chuckles softly]

331
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,000
Where are they going?
[gasps] Can we go with them?

332
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,333
-It looks like a lot of fun.
-I'm sorry, Molly.

333
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,791
-You're not ready to go off the island.
-But I…

334
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,458
Uh, Rocky? Little help?

335
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,916
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,375
Why am I not ready?

337
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,750
I'm a big, brave girl.

338
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,000
-You always say so.
-I know.

339
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,708
But you're still a child.

340
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,166
Says who?

341
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,375
Says me and your dad.

342
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,541
Right, Rocky?

343
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,958
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes.
Listen to your mom, kiddo.

344
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,958
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow?
Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?

345
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
Something that's a little shorter.

346
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:20,833
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks
because I am a Lone Free Ranger.

347
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,166
Like Dad was.

[both gasp]

349
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,583
I've seen his poster.

350
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,708
Ah.

351
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,416
He used to live over there,
and you did too.

-[Ginger gasps]
-[laughs nonchalantly, clears throat]

353
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,291
Did I say that? I don't… I don't remember.

354
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,375
That's it.

355
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,875
Molly, you are not leaving this island.

356
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,833
You can't make me stay here.
You're not the boss of me.

357
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,083
Actually, I am.

358
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:48,458
Look, Molly, you've got
everything you want right here.

359
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,583
Except for one thing.

360
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,958
And what's that?

361
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,083
Freedom.

No.

Wait, what's a death wish?

410
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,375
Isn't it a bit late
for you to be out, baby girl?

I'm not a baby girl.

I'm a… I'm a big, brave girl.

413

And isn't it a bit late
for you to be out too?

[chuckles] Okay, I like it.

Molly.

[sighs] Although,
it's kind of a goofy name.

420
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,416
So I'm thinking of changing it to…

421
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,458
Zip it, kidda.

422
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,625

00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,916
To the happy chicken truck.

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,791
[gasps] You've seen them too?

426

Right.

Wherever that truck's goin',

429
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,958
it's gonna be cooler
than a penguin's toenails.

430
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,083
Uh, what's a toenail?

431
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,041
What's a penguin?

432
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:08,041
Oh! You have got so much to learn.
Come on.

433
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,875
[sighs] Wait for me!

434
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,916
I mean, so she found my poster,
and I told her a story.

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,291
I don't think that's such a big deal.

436
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,541
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible
to encourage our daughter

437
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,375
to be a Lone Free Ranger.

438
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,041
You know, if you had it your way,
she'd still be in her shell.

439
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,041
Well, better in her shell
than out on the open road.

440
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,666
So, do you live on an island too?

441
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,833
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.

442
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,208
Then the trucks came,
and they said I was too small to go.

443
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,750
But that's not gonna stop me.

444
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,625
You get to sit in a bucket.

445
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,333
What chicken doesn't want
their own bucket?

446
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,250
I want a bucket.

447
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,708
The thing about us, Mol,

448
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,458
is that we wanna go
where we wanna go whenever we want.

449
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,875
Yeah. With nobody telling us
what we can and can't do.

450
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
Me and you, kidda. All the way.

451
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,916

What is that?

460
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,375
You've never seen a human before?

461
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,041
We had them back at the farm.

462
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,083
[quietly] They're kinda stupid.

463
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,708
They fed us and tidied up after us.
They're basically like waitin' staff.

464
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,958
Oi!

465
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,250
-Oi, you!
-Huh?

466
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,625
How did you two get out here?

467
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,750

-[Molly] Uh…

468

00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,416
What an honor
to have a knight of the realm with us.

963
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,250
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant.

964
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,416
My name is… Oh.

965
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,000
[yelps, chuckles]

966
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,291
[Molly gasps]

967
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,458
Oh.

968
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,166
[splutters] Here at Fun Land Farms,

969
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,208
we do everything we can
to make our chickens feel right at home.

970
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,000
Well, I must say, I've never seen
a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.

971
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,625
Is all this security really necessary?

972
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,750
[Fry] Oh yes.

973
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,666
Molly.

974
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,083
You see, behind these doors are secrets

975
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:25,583
that will change
the world of poultry technology forever.

976
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,708
Come on.

977
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,375
[panting] No!

978
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,916
[all grunt]

979
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:39,166
Oi, what are you lot doing?

980
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,333

-[all] Attack!
-[guard groans]

983
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,625
This place is a maze.

984
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,000
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?

985
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,458
[footsteps below]

986
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,208
-There she is.
-[Rocky] Huh?

987
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,125
Molly?

988
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,375
Molly! Molly!

989
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,083
[Molly panting]

990
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:09,458
[Fry] And, um,
how's the restaurant business?

991
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,166
[Smith] Actually, a little slow.

992
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,541
[Ginger gasps]

993
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,458
[chuckling] Oh well,
I think we can help you with that.

994
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,541
Molly! [yells]

995
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,583
[Fry chuckles]

996
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,208
No! No!

997
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,416
Molly! Molly! Molly!

998
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,291
[Ginger grunts]

999
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,166
Ah. Ginger?

1000
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,083
[sighs]

1001
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,916
[ominous music playing]

1002
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,333
Right. I'm gone.

1003
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:43,125
Well, can't we just take the lift?

1004
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,666
[bell dings]

1005
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,541
All I can say, Dr. Fry,
is this had better be…

1006
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,375
good.

1007
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:52,916
[mysterious music playing]

1008
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,541
My, uh, partner
will be joining us shortly.

1009
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:04,166
In the meantime, we've prepared
a little presentation. [chuckles]

1010
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,208
Please, be seated.

1011
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,416
-[Fry chuckles]
-[control panel whirs, beeps]

1012
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
[whirring]

1013
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,500
[lively flute music playing]

1014
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,791
[film projector whirring]

1015
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,416
[narrator] This is an ordinary chicken.

1016
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,875
Plain, dull, and easily frightened.

1017
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:38,333
-[horn honks]
-[panicked clucking]

1018
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,458
[narrator] Like any simpleminded creature,

1019
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,958
its natural instincts,
when faced with processing,

1020
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,041
is fear and panic.

1021
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,458
[frantic clucking]

1022
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,791
[grinding whir]

1023
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,541
[narrator] When this occurs,
the muscles tense,

1024
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:55,125
which cause the connective tissues
to form knots.

1025
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,291
[muscle whooshes]

1026
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,500
[narrator] The result?

1027
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,583
Meat that is tough, dry, and flavorless.

1028
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,041
Mummy, this meat is tough,
dry, and flavorless.

1029
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,250
-I hate you, Mummy.
-Oh!

1030
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:10,708
Molly.

1031
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:13,208
[narrator] Fear not,
underappreciated mother.

1032
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,208
For what if science could change all that?

1033
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:20,208
For what if science could alter
a chicken's response to fear?

1034
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,791
[hen exclaims]

1035
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:22,750
[grunts]

1036
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,750
[narrator] What if it could make
a chicken happy to be processed?

1037
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:27,666
[hen exclaims]

1038
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,875
[grinding whir]

1039
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,708
[narrator] Then you'd say,
"Well done, science."

1040
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,291
[Ginger grunts]

1041
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,250
[narrator] Because a happy chicken

1042
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,458
is a tasty chicken.

1043
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,625
[cooker chimes]

1044
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:42,166
[chimes play]

1045
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,375
This is the most delicious chicken
in the whole wide world.

1046
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,750
I love you, Mummy.

1047
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,416
Thank you, science.

1048
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,666
[whispering] Molly.

1049
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,791
[control panel beeps]

1050
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,000
That's a clever little cartoon, Dr. Fry.

1051
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,708
But will you be able to do it?

1052
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,791
[woman, echoing] We already have.

1053
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,333
-[gasps] That voice.
-[footsteps approaching]

[tense music playing]

1055
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:30,208
Allow me to introduce my wife.

[tense music swells]

1057
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:35,208
[Fry] Melisha Tweedy.

1058
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,166
Welcome to the future.

1059
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:44,083
-[Ginger gasps]
-[sinister music playing]

1060
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,250
It's her.

1061
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,791
[sinister music continues]

1062
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:52,541
Darling, this is Sir Eat-a-Lot.

1063
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,333
The name is Reginald Smith.

1064
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:58,208
Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant chain.

1065
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:59,541
[Fry chuckles nervously]

1066
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,041
Hello, Reginald.

1067
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,666
I see you've met
my current husband, Dr. Fry.

1068
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,666
Was I attracted to his large inheritance
and vast acres of land?

1069
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:15,875
No, it was his mind.

1070
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:20,666
You probably can't tell
by looking at him, but he's a genius.

1071
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,375
You flatter me, darling. [chuckles]

1072
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:26,708
With degrees from Oxford
and Cambridge in clinical neurology,

1073
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:30,541
behavioral psychology,
genetic engineering…

1074
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,750
And drama!

1075
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,583
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]
-[Fry yelps, thuds]

1076
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,458
Now you've had the appetizer,

1077
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,333
time for the main course.

1078
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:43,666
Come.

1079
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,000
[Fry groans]

1080
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,791
[energetic music playing]

1081
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,291
Molly, no. Get back.

1082
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,000
[grunting, muffled] Let me go!

1083
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,708
Right. Try and find Molly.

1084
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,958
-[control panel beeping]
-Oh, look.

1085
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,750
Rocky and the rats are on telly.

1086
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:05,208
Looks like a real cliffhanger.

1087
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:06,958
-[Bunty grunts]
-Where is she?

1088

[ominous music playing]

1089
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,750
Oh.

1090
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,833
[hens clamoring below]

1091
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,208
[Fry] Oh, look.

1092
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,666
They like the new egg cup ride.

1093
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:24,791
[chuckles sheepishly]

1094

[Molly gasps]

1095
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,541
[quietly] Frizzle.

1096
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,375
[gasps] Mum?

1097
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,000
Oh, Mollypod.

1098
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,291
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1099
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,000
Promise never to run away again.

1100
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,458
-Did they hurt you?
-I'm fine, but I think they eat…

1101
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:40,750
-[Mrs. Tweedy] Come on. Get on with it.
-Shh.

1102
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,625
[Fry] Right you are, pumpkin.

1103
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,708
Behold.

1104
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,208
[dramatically] The remote control.

1105
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:55,000
-And the other remote controls.
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

1106
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,625
Why three?

1107
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,833
-Nobody knows.
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

1108
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,833
Let's go with…

1109
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,541
that one.

1110
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,416
-[collars power down]
-[hens] Huh?

1111
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,375
-Why am I playing golf?
-Where am I?

1112
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:14,541
-What am I doing?
-Molly? Where are you, Molly?

1113
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,333
What's going on?

1114
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:19,083
[splutters] No, no, no.
Wrong one, my angel.

1115
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:21,291
-That's the off button. [chuckles]

-[gasps] It's me.
-[joyful fanfare playing]

1122

01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:48,958
I should not have told you all
of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.

1440
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,916
No, this is on me.

1441
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,916
I used to hate being fenced in.

1442
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,083
So why did I expect you
to be any different?

1443
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,875
I guess I was afraid
you were so much like me.

1444
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,333
What's wrong with being like you?

1445
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,000
Nothing.

1446
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,833
-Because your mom is the best.
-[sighs]

1447
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:19,083
And she always has a plan.

1448
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,041
Not this time.

1449
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:23,750
[tense music playing]

1450
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,583
[sighs] He's here.

[Fry murmuring nervously]

1452
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,708
-Are we ready to fry, Fry?
-[buttons beeping]

1453
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,375
Five minutes, pumpkin. [chuckles]

1454
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,541
-Make it four.
-[Fry, shakily] Oh.

1455
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:35,250
Where is she?

1456
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,583
-[bell dings]
-Hmm?

1457
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:41,083
Them runaway chickens, uh,
have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.

1458
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,708
In the silo, you say?

1459
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,166
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.

1460
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,416
Production starts in three minutes.

1461
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,875
[splutters] Three? [yelps]

1462
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:55,041
Looks like you've just run out of cluck,
little chickens.

1463
01:06:56,833 --> 01:07:00,916
-[machine whirring]
-[menacing orchestral music playing]

1464
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,958
[rumbling]

1465
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,208
[family] Huh?

1466
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,125
[Rocky] Huh?

1467
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:06,750
Huh?

1468
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,166
[Babs whines]

1469
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,666
I think there's a grinder
at the bottom of this thing.

1470
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,625
On the plus side, though,
we will all probably drown

1471
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,666
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.

1472
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1473
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,333
Popcorn. [chuckles nervously]

1474
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:25,208
Popcorn, everyone. Look.
Look, popcorn. [laughs]

1475
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,250
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to…

1476
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:31,958
Ah.

1477
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,750
[bright music playing]

1478
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:36,583
The answer to all life's problems.

1479
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:37,708
Of course.

1480
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,916
Mac, we need heat.

1481
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,625
-Lots of it.
-[Mac] Oh.

1482
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,833
Will this work? [grunts]

1483
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,708
[grunts] Perfect.

1484
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:48,541
[grunts] Now, does anyone have a match?

1485
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,000
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.

1486
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,291
-You'll blow us all to bits.
-[Molly gasps]

1487
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:59,458
Besides, we've used the last one.

1488
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,375
Oh no.

1489
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,333
-[gentle chimes]
-[Rocky gasps]

1490
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,375
[gasps] That's my girl.

01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:15,916
[suspenseful music playing]

1492
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,041
Um, can I once again raise
my health and safety concerns?

1493
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:21,458
What is it?

1494
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:23,458
[Rocky and Babs yelp]

1495
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:25,625
-[both] Huh?
-[rumbling and popping]

1496
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,000
All right.

1497
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,041
Oh!

1498
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,666
[alarm blaring]

1499
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,541
Mm. That tastes nice.

1500
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:39,958
Is there any more?

1501
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,708
[all scream]

1502
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,125
[Fowler] But guess what?

1503
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,916
Just as Whizzbang Charlie
thought we were back in Blighty,

1504
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,291
enemy fire at six o'clock.

1505
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,791
-[whimsical music playing]
-Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?

1506
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,791
Good old British weather.

1507
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:04,958
Unpredictable.

1508
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,458
You never know what's coming.

1509
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:08,333
-[groans]
-[Bunty sighs]

1510
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,000
Outrageous.

1511
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:13,333
[laughs]

-[groans]
-[Molly] Hmm?

01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,041
[laughing and cheering]

1518
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,125
-Get in there!
-We made it.

1519
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,875
-Look.
-[Fetcher] Whoo-hoo!

1520
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:29,750
Fowler's only gone
and set up our escape route.

1521
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:34,375
-[bright music playing]
-Well done, you old sausage.

1522
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,791
Firm handshake will do, thank you.

1523
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:41,708
[laughs] Mission accomplished.
Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?

1524
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,208
[Babs] Oh yes.

1525
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:45,416
[group chattering excitedly]

1526
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,666
[Fetcher] Oh, look, Nick.

1527
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,333
Have we got snacks for the way home?

1528

Ginger, are you coming?

1537
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,375
No, I'm not.

1538
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,291
I'm going back.

[Molly gasps]

1540
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,333
For Frizzle?

1541
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,250
For Frizzle and all the chickens.

-Yes!

[tender instrumental music playing]

1544
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:44,375
Just because where we live is cut off
from the world doesn't mean we are too.

1545
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,833
No chicken is an island.

1546
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,291
[Rocky] Hmm.

1547
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,166
We are with you, Ginger.

1548
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,125
Aye, me too.

1549
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,583
Me four.

1550
01:10:58,666 --> 01:10:59,708
The rats are in.

1551
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,833
Right. What's the plan, Mum?

1552
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:08,541
Oh, well, I didn't think you…

1553
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:10,583
Rocky.

1554
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:15,750
Hey, Molly, um,
are you sure you're ready for this?

1555
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,125
-I was hatched ready, Dad.

What was that noise up on the roof?

1561
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,041
-[guard grunts, thuds]
-Sounded like an explosion.

1562
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:41,916
[gasps, yelps] Looks like one of the silos
has blown its top.

1563
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,458
-[alarm blaring]
-Oh.

1564
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,458
Maybe you shouldn't have put
those chickens

1565
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,500
through the grinder, my love.

1566
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,208
Don't be ridiculous.

1567
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,916
[Smith] Melisha,
all ready for the big day?

1568
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,375
[Mrs. Tweedy sighs]

1569
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:56,333
[cheerfully] Oh yes, Reginald.

1570
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,208
Everything is tickety-boo.

1571
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:01,041
[Smith] Jolly good.
My truck is ready to go.

1572
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,875
We've got to move fast.

1573
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:05,166
While Tweedy is busy
with her guest outside,

1574
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,250
we sneak back in.

1575
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:10,916
Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac
to where all the chickens are.

1576
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,083
Come on.

1577
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,375
-This way.
-[Babs] Ah.

1578
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:16,125
[Ginger] Stay out of sight

1579
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,666
and get ready to stop
the chickens going up that staircase.

1580
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,833
Rocky, we've got
to get hold of that button.

1581
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,208
-[remote beeps]
-[Ginger] And disable those collars.

1582
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:26,250
[hens murmur]

1583
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,125
[Ginger] As soon as the collars are off,

1584
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,083
Molly's team leads the chickens
out of there.

1585
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,208
-We bust our way out.
-[hens clamoring]

1586
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:36,208
Steal the truck,

1587
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,958
then we're home free.

1588
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,208
Well, what are we waiting for?

1589
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:43,375
-All right. Let's do this.
-We're doing it today, are we?

1590
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,291
[Fowler] So where was I? Ah, yes.

1591
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,666
Whizzbang Charlie had lost
his undercarriage,

1592
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,458
and the old crate was catching fire…

1593
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,458
[gentle music playing]

1594
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:57,583
Actually, Melisha,
I have a little something for our big day.

1595
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:02,500
[sweetly] Why, Reginald,
this is all very sudden.

1596
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,958
-Uh…
-[music stops abruptly]

1597
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:06,041
