2
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:55,624
The fumes of the dead
hung in the air like poison.

3
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:02,739
A plague more cruel and more pitiless
than war had descended upon us.

4
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:08,117
A pestilence
that would leave half our kingdom dead.

5
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,119
Where did it come from?

6
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:16,998
What carried it's germ?

7
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:20,282
The priests told us
it was God's punishment.

8
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:22,555
For what sin?

9
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:25,942
What commandment must we break
that would earn this?

10
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:31,678
No, we knew the truth.

11
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:36,399
This was not God's work,
but devilry.

12
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:38,721
Or witchcraft.

13
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:44,159
And our task, to hunt down a demon,
is God's cure.

14
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,756
Brother Thomas.

15
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,972
Brother Thomas.

16
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:58,949
- Who was taken from us?
- Brother Ignatius.

17
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:01,890
- Is it the pestilence?
- We have not been told.

18
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:05,805
I have no signs.
Please brother.

19
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,958
Let me out.

20
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,829
Averill.

21
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:36,500
O thanks pretty gorgeous.

22
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:40,621
- Where've you been?
- I was confined... sacred.

23
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,777
I thought you were dead.

24
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:52,380
- I'm alright.
- I prayed, prayed all the time.

25
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,367
I'm alright.

26
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,642
I've brought food.

27
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,376
One of our brothers
died this morning, Averill.

28
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:09,465
Even the monastery is no longer safe,
you must go now.

29
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:13,378
You must go back to Dentwich Forest
and you must hide there till this is passed.

30
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:19,703
On Sunday the prior said the pestilence was
God's new purge, send to wash away our sins.

31
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,856
- Is God punishing us?
- No.

32
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,988
No.

33
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,439
You must go now.

34
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,214
You must go back to Dentwich.

35
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:41,001
You must go.

36
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,144
- Osmund, I...
- Averill, you'll die.

37
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,460
And you will not?

38
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,057
Come with me.

39
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,777
If I leave the monastery now,
I betray God.

40
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:15,179
We've already betrayed him.

41
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:59,173
You know the Martyrs Cross
at Dentwich forest?

42
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:03,796
I will wait for you there,
every morning at dawn for one week.

43
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,876
And then I will be gone.

44
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,552
Forgive me, Father. I am confused.

45
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,166
I confess, I am torn.

46
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,572
Can I serve you outside of these walls?

47
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,531
I would leave here, but I would never
stray from your grace, father.

48
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,593
Show me Your will.

49
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,628
Father, give me a sign.

50
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:44,485
I am Ulric, envoy to the bishop.

51
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:48,192
What I say know does not leave these walls.

52
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:53,812
Word has reached the bishop of a village
that does not suffer as the rest.

53
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,010
They say it is a sanctuary
from the pestilence.

54
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:02,927
There are many villages that have not
been ravaged yet by the pestilence.

55
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,888
It is claimed these villagers
are beyond it's icy grasp.

56
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,446
Then they are greatly mistaken.

57
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:15,889
These are difficult times.

58
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:19,240
Such claims however fantastical...

59
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:23,687
can find favor with those
less educated than you or I.

60
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:28,365
Precisely why we cannot fall foul
of rumor and superstition.

61
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:31,087
God's grip on his people is lucent.

62
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:36,220
We must ensure the flock is not tempted
to look beyond God and church for answers.

63
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,447
I must see for myself
how this village is kept safe.

64
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,567
What part have we in this?

65
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:45,668
The village I seek
lies in the great marsh.

66
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,918
I require a guide, a man of God,
to show the way.

67
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,086
No man here fit for such a task.

68
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:58,245
With the bishop's blessing
I may choose any man here.

69
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,806
Out of respect..
I grant you that choice

70
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,157
I will lead you there.

71
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:08,998
No, he is a mere novice.
This requires a more experienced hand.

72
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,560
Let him speak.

73
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,764
The said village you seek
lies in the great marsh.

74
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:15,365
I was raised
close by in Dentwich Forest.

75
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,722
I know the area better than any man.

76
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,844
He has all the experience I require.

77
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:26,767
You will lead us.
We leave at dawn.

78
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,876
Osmund, that man is more dangerous
than the pestilence itself.

79
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,475
Father, I prayed for guidance.

80
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:37,167
God has answered.

81
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:59,594
Even if you survive,
the world out there will change you.

82
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,271
Perhaps that's what I want Father.

83
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,476
My lady love and I, we lived in joyeous sin,

84
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:27,639
now my lady love has got the blackened skin.

85
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:31,557
My lady love and I,
we pour our love so brave,

86
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,911
now my lady love rots in an early grave.

87
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:49,230
We have our guide.

88
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,030
God has no men left,

89
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,995
he sends us a boy.

90
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,078
Are you up to it, son?

91
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:10,111
I can lead you there.

92
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:11,988
Pray you do.

93
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:16,511
Split any man from his asshole to his apple.

94
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,710
What's that for?

95
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,436
How much does he know?

96
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:26,663
Ulric was ahh 'frugal' shall we say
with the truth.

97
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,304
This village we're headed to...

98
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:35,987
they've cast God aside.
In his place sits a demon.

99
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:41,667
There was talk of sacrifice.
Of men eating men and of raising the dead.

100
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:42,829
Now we're charged...

101
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,330
to bring the leader of this village back
for confession, trial and execution.

102
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,345
The bishop seeks to roast themself
a necromancer.

103
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,846
Sorry, what is a necromancer?

104
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:55,188
A necromancer is someone
who plucks the dead from the cold earth,

105
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,704
breathes new life into them.

106
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:01,345
We have the tools, we have the will.

107
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:03,627
We journey into hell.

108
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:08,070
- But God travels with us.
- So you misled me.

109
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,166
Return to your monastery
if you feel betrayed...

110
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,867
or join us
and do God's work.

111
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:16,866
Let's get this cleared up, let's get going.

112
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:20,472
That includes you, Swire.

113
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,901
We are not as bad as you think.

114
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:09,419
But worse.
But we need you alive.

115
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:13,182
You seem well suited to keeping men alive.

116
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:17,662
I've spent many a long years
in the king's army with Wolfstan and Griff.

117
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,050
I'll be honest with ya'.

118
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:23,051
We've never faced a demon before,
but we take what comes our way.

119
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,705
- What happened to him?
- Ivo was captured.

120
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:31,264
Wouldn't talk, so the bastard French
tore out his tongue.

121
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:36,622
- And him?
- Mold is a men to leave alone...

122
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,543
unless there's butchery to be done.

123
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:42,629
And Dalywag, he is a torturer,
a hangman,

124
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:47,539
and if the rumor is true, murderer,
thief and deceiver of women.

125
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:50,103
But apart from that he's a good man.

126
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:53,907
- What about Ulric?
- I've got a wife and child.

127
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:59,626
I'm here for the money. Ulric is here,
because God told him to come.

128
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,338
- Burn!
- What's it...

129
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:15,140
Have mercy, please have mercy.
No!

130
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:23,140
I've done nothing.

131
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:27,094
- We must help her.
- Do you here me?! You deserve to burn!

132
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:30,773
- I've down nothing.
- Burn! Burn the witch! Burn!

133
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,023
- You're in league with the devil.
- What is her crime?

134
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:38,838
She brought death
to our village.

135
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,339
Death is all around us,
and it's no invitation.

136
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,400
This does not involve you monk.
Step aside.

137
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:45,101
I have done nothing, please.

138
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:47,057
Please, stand aside.

139
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:52,420
What is this woman accused of?

140
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:55,321
She poisoned our well in a pact with
the devil now half the village is dead.

141
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:58,655
I offered a simple blessing over
our water to keep everyone safe.

142
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,740
- Liar.
- I did nothing wrong.

143
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,761
The dying began
after she was seen at the well.

144
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:03,661
You have her confession?

145
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:06,280
Plenty of us saw her cast her spell.
Now she must burn,

146
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:09,160
to spare what remains of our village.

147
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:12,775
Move aside.

148
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:19,854
I will not ask you again.

149
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,779
Back.

150
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,134
Thank you.

151
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,770
Do not stop again.

152
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,009
Come on, brown slug.

153
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:20,410
As sure as the sun will rise and fall,
witches will burn.

154
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:25,489
There's a village in the north,
that burned 128 witches in one night.

155
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,930
That's sixteen an hour, for eight hours.

156
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:33,495
By the time that night was through,
they'd killed every woman in the village.

157
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,735
By the end of that week
the men were shagging pigs.

158
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:41,931
Pestilence isn't trial enough,
now God has us shagging pigs.

159
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:46,295
This village we seek, you been there?

160
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:49,852
No, but I know where it lies.

161
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,650
Hell awaits us, or so we're told.

162
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:55,310
If you've not got the stomach for it,
then leave it now.

163
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,511
And I'll have your share
of the bounty.

164
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,727
What is the Church believe
this pestilence is come from?

165
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:05,210
I don't believe God
is punishing us like many do.

166
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:10,008
I say from France,
where all foul things emerge.

167
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:13,967
For once Swire,
you might not be too far from the truth.

168
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:18,652
Three summers passed,
we fought a battle at Crecy in Normandy,

169
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:20,645
King Edward's army was dwarfed.

170
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:24,546
For every 20 of us,
there were a 100 Frenchmen, at least.

171
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,973
The French...

172
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,485
Ah, the French.

173
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:33,130
They could sense victory,
you could smell it.

174
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:38,365
On that day for the first time
our archers used the longbow.

175
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:41,212
Quicker to load, further in flight.

176
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:45,487
Their arrows, their arrows were useless.
Couldn't reach us.

177
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:50,163
And ours, ours were like a dark,
buzzing cloud.

178
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:55,690
And that day's end, field was littered
with their dead and their dying.

179
00:20:56,412 --> 00:21:00,962
And custom how matter how fierce the battle,
was to use the misericorde.

180
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,844
Misericorde, it's the 'mercy-giver'.

181
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,329
You stab straight through the armpit
directly into the heart.

182
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,630
It's quick and painless.

183
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,443
But on this day,
there was an end to chivalry.

184
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:18,171
King Edward ordered every Frenchman
left alive to be killed without mercy.

185
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:23,165
Arms, heads, legs...

186
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:25,362
hacked away.

187
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:30,519
God's greatest army
descended into savagery.

188
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,086
Forgive me, but how does that
conscern the pestilence?

189
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,201
We invited Death among us that day.

190
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,367
He hasn't left us since.

191
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,688
That woman you killed,

192
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:18,244
she was not a witch.

193
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,958
Why did you volanteer to join us, monk?

194
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,322
To serve God.

195
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:30,280
Killing witches serves God.

196
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:34,040
The woman was already dead.

197
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:35,803
If I had freed her,

198
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,604
the mob would have caught her again
and burned her.

199
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:43,321
I spared her suffering.

200
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:48,996
Sometimes that is all you can do.

201
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,278
He says: 'turn back'.

202
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:18,189
Where we're headed
men have become savages.

203
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:50,678
It must've been something
pretty special,

204
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,479
to tempt you away from that nice,
warm monastery.

205
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:02,671
- Anything you wanna tell me?
- No.

206
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,234
You know what my job is?

207
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:17,394
I am a torturer, truth-getter.
Spend hours on a man.

208
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:21,533
Can smell a lie,
and I smell you.

209
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,306
Pray somewhere else, if i were you.

210
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,863
Have you broken any vows yet, boy?

211
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:12,791
Leave him be, Mold.

212
00:26:16,872 --> 00:26:18,784
Back, get back!
Griff!

213
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:22,424
Griff?

214
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:28,504
- I said: Get Back!
- Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

215
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,586
Let me look.

216
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,163
Let me look.

217
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,509
Just going to take a look.

218
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:45,630
Alright? Okay my friend.
Just having a look.

219
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:19,824
Why didn't you tell us?

220
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,099
I'm sorry.

221
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:26,459
His journey is finished here.

222
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:35,305
I prefer mercy.

223
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:39,902
I need to make
a confession to the friar.

224
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:41,003
No...

225
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:46,134
- cannot be sure how this thing spread.
- Who the hell asked you?!

226
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,465
I will take your confession.

227
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:55,179
Come, you shall have absolution.

228
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:03,901
You keep your mouth shut!

229
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:18,579
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine
patris et filii et spiritus sancti.

230
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,294
Forgive me.

231
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:27,096
Our Father who art in Heaven...

232
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,541
Hallowed be thy name...

233
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:34,693
Come thy kingdom, forfilled be thine
when in heaven as in earth...

234
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:37,842
bread give us today...

235
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:44,979
I need a moment with him.

236
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:47,015
Alright.

237
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:05,838
I'm glad it's you.
I can see things... Urgh...

238
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,376
Farewell my friend.

239
00:29:33,202 --> 00:29:35,292
Bury him.

240
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,212
- The forest of Dentwich.
- How far to the marsh?

241
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,371
Half a day, perhaps less.

242
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:18,256
Be on your guard.
God has slipped over the horizon.

243
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:31,686
You're on watch tonight, Swire.

244
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:45,850
Giving Griff absolution...

245
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:49,211
took courage.

246
00:30:56,493 --> 00:31:00,043
Do you truly believe
this village can rise the dead?

247
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:02,981
I would not be here otherwise.

248
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:05,546
You doubt it?

249
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,432
I believe that hunting
necromancers and demons...

250
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,733
serves men
more than it serves god.

251
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:17,167
You have learned much
nestled inside the monastery.

252
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:23,523
Demons and necromancers are among us.

253
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,112
As you will find out.

254
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:29,593
Soon enough.

255
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:35,004
I'll get some sleep.

256
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,119
Averill.

257
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:42,399
Averill.

258
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:49,365
Averill.

259
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,164
Averill?

260
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:17,592
No.

261
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:31,160
No, no, no. No.

262
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:37,522
Averill.

263
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,684
Wake up!

264
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:57,786
Ulric!

265
00:33:57,987 --> 00:33:58,984
Get up!

266
00:33:58,985 --> 00:34:00,483
Wolfstan!

267
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:03,523
Ulric, wake up!
Wake up! Ulric!

268
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,115
- How many are in the forrest?
- Calm down.

269
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:06,916
How many? What did you see?
What did you see?

270
00:34:06,923 --> 00:34:08,635
- They're in the forrest. I don't...
- How many? How many?

271
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:10,035
I don't know. I don't know!

272
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:11,547
- How many?
- He doesn't know.

273
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:26,160
Mold, forward, now.

274
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:44,679
Wait. Wait.

275
00:35:26,478 --> 00:35:28,194
Get in there.
Now!

276
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:54,686
Yah, shut the fuck...

277
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,014
No!

278
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:21,242
God! God!

279
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:42,184
Where is Ivo?

280
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:50,587
You alright?

281
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:04,907
We lost Ivo.

282
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:10,784
Why did you leave the camp?

283
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:12,666
Speak.

284
00:38:14,227 --> 00:38:16,946
- I came her to meet a woman.
- And where is she?

285
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:19,502
She did not survive the forrest.

286
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:23,347
God has punished me
for leaving his monastery.

287
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,778
God has better things to think of.

288
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,744
Because of you...

289
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:33,303
one of my men is dead.

290
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:41,862
If we move, we move now.

291
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,136
How do we know
the man we've come for is not here?

292
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,780
These men are nothing more
than common thieves.

293
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:52,065
- You will lead us to the great marsh.
- Sir, I am of no use to you.

294
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:54,541
You will lead us...

295
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:59,825
or stay here alone and be damned.

296
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:34,777
The village lies beyond the marsh.

297
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:36,973
What's the plan?

298
00:39:38,982 --> 00:39:41,372
Identify the heretic...

299
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,195
capture him...

300
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:44,603
put him in the cage.

301
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:48,170
- That will never go across the marsh.
- Then we'll leave it behind!

302
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,413
Drag him here.

303
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,131
Come on, boy.

304
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:12,135
Come on.

305
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,759
What brings you to our village?

306
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:31,364
We seek refuge.

307
00:43:32,128 --> 00:43:34,165
A place to rest, nothing more.

308
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,561
Then you are welcome.

309
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:45,517
My name is Hob.

310
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,440
I am Ulric.

311
00:43:53,648 --> 00:43:56,446
You were attacked?

312
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:57,922
In the forest.

313
00:43:58,129 --> 00:44:02,122
Then you did well to reach us.
That forest can be dangerous.

314
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:06,000
- May I ask what you were doing?
- Bringing relief to the suffering.

315
00:44:06,203 --> 00:44:08,082
Relief?

316
00:44:08,285 --> 00:44:10,116
From what?

317
00:44:10,325 --> 00:44:12,794
Word of the pestilence has not reached you?

318
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:15,645
Word is all that has reached us.

319
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:24,635
Come.

320
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:29,673
What the hell is going on?

321
00:44:29,883 --> 00:44:32,761
We need guile to draw out the necromancer.

322
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:41,960
Noone acts
unless I say so.

323
00:44:57,622 --> 00:44:59,533
Tonight we'll feed you and give you a bed.

324
00:44:59,842 --> 00:45:02,800
And in the morning we'll escort you
to a safe part of the forrest.

325
00:45:03,002 --> 00:45:04,880
We're not welcome?

326
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:06,716
Of course.

327
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,519
But why would you stay?

328
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,591
Here is some buckets,
you need to wash.

329
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,798
This is no time to be blinded by grief.

330
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:48,570
If this is hell
can't wait for heaven.

331
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:51,996
You're not bound for heaven, Swire.
Believe me.

332
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:20,876
I'll tend to your wounds.

333
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:23,410
I'll tend to your wound.

334
00:46:26,457 --> 00:46:28,606
That needs to be dressed.

335
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:32,396
- Come with me.
- Maybe you should get her seeing to.

336
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:03,023
- Where are you from?
- From the monastery at Staveley.

337
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:07,147
You're in mourning.

338
00:47:07,356 --> 00:47:08,947
Is it so obvious?

339
00:47:10,513 --> 00:47:12,328
Was it a woman?

340
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:15,471
It's no sin to love a woman.

341
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:17,126
I have sworn to god.

342
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:20,390
A man needs more
than divine love to sustain him.

343
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:23,344
And he shouldn't be punished for wanting it.

344
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:27,306
Do you have a husband?

345
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:31,223
- My husband is dead.
- I'm sorry.

346
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,832
Take off your clothes.

347
00:47:35,994 --> 00:47:38,270
I need to dress your wound.

348
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,185
The pain is going already.

349
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,744
It's extraordinary, the pain is gone.

350
00:48:13,948 --> 00:48:16,019
It is a strong remedy.

351
00:48:20,753 --> 00:48:23,026
May I ask you, how did your husband die?

352
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:24,886
Men like you killed him.

353
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,213
Men like me?

354
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,580
Men of God.

355
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:09,102
This church has not seen worship
for a long while.

356
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:35,982
- The woman you went with...
- She dressed my wounds, nothing more.

357
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:40,195
Nothing here is what it seems.

358
00:49:40,506 --> 00:49:42,462
You can help us keep warm, girls.

359
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,277
Child.

360
00:49:58,343 --> 00:49:59,935
I found it.

361
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:03,020
Where?
- In the marsh.

362
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:13,215
Every village we rode through
had graveyards bursting.

363
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:16,423
No corpse-fueled pits, no burning bodies.

364
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,091
We cannot judge them for having no disease.

365
00:50:19,303 --> 00:50:22,179
A party was send before us
charged with the same task...

366
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,896
four men, none returned.

367
00:50:25,102 --> 00:50:27,253
They were lead by a man like myself.

368
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:33,095
This symbol is worn only
by the bishops envoy.

369
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:36,377
The girl wore its twin.

370
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,057
Please welcome our guests.
What is ours is now yours.

371
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,332
- To our guests.
- 'To our guest'.

372
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:19,172
We also want to give thanks that we've
been spared the terrible pestilence...

373
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:21,813
sweeping through the land.

374
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,016
If I may...

375
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:33,933
I would like to express
our gratitude for your welcome.

376
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,254
Now let us pray.

377
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:46,415
Pater noster qui es in caelis,
sanctificetur nomen tuum.

378
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,692
Adveniat regnum tuum.

379
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,365
Fiat voluntas tua,
sicut in caelo et in terra...

380
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:56,044
Panem nostrum
cotidianum da nobis hodie.

381
00:51:58,298 --> 00:52:04,168
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra,
sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.

382
00:52:06,419 --> 00:52:08,136
- Amen.
- Amen.

383
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:12,446
I expected grace
not the entire Lord's Prayer.

384
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:26,533
Women outnumber men here.
Maybe that's why a woman speaks for them.

385
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:28,804
Do not be fooled.

386
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:32,884
Evil works within this place,
within these people.

387
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,324
Osmund.

388
00:52:49,892 --> 00:52:51,966
I just need some air.

389
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,202
We found her in the forrest.

390
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:09,084
She spoke of you before she died.

391
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,489
Forgive me Lord. I am angry.

392
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,797
Why did you take her?

393
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,923
Why did you take her?

394
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:54,605
Osmund, where were you?

395
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:00,997
Why did you betray me?

396
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:04,958
Why?

397
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,474
Why did you betray me?

398
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:12,318
Osmund? Osmund?

399
00:55:12,565 --> 00:55:13,963
Osmund.

400
00:55:17,684 --> 00:55:18,832
Osmund?

401
00:55:19,043 --> 00:55:22,274
- What troubles you?
- We're to become beasts.

402
00:55:22,482 --> 00:55:25,315
We must become more than beasts
if we are to triumph here.

403
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:29,892
I see no evil here, just a simple village
that has not yet been ravished.

404
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,624
Leave a suffering to your heart
daunt your senses.

405
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:35,523
Sir, how would you know,
you have no heart to suffer.

406
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:37,679
I have known grief.

407
00:55:37,885 --> 00:55:40,795
My wife and child sit at God's side.

408
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,273
Yes...

409
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,758
this village is without the pestilence.

410
00:55:57,762 --> 00:56:00,323
But it is also without God.

411
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,996
For this they will suffer.

412
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:34,358
Are you shy?

413
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:42,555
I am ugly and I am Christian.

414
00:56:42,759 --> 00:56:45,397
And that is not a good combination in here.

415
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:48,235
Hm? Piss off.

416
00:57:06,078 --> 00:57:08,034
When will she be buried?

417
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:11,227
Do not worry.
I will take care of everything.

418
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:13,555
Can I see her again?

419
00:57:13,755 --> 00:57:15,472
You will.

420
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,673
You were going to tell me
these men mean us harm.

421
00:57:28,877 --> 00:57:31,153
Me in particular.

422
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,113
I knew the moment I looked into Ulrics eyes.

423
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:38,273
But I did not know
with whose side you were on.

424
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,514
Come with me.

425
00:57:44,955 --> 00:57:46,434
Come.

426
00:58:19,155 --> 00:58:20,873
What's going on?

427
00:58:21,274 --> 00:58:23,502
Something you should see.

428
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,029
Now.

429
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,137
What's wrong?

430
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:03,578
Get off.

431
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:21,217
Eat and drink.

432
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:39,055
As a Christian you'll appreciate
the concept of betrayal.

433
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,016
Together...
Keep your head together.

434
01:02:35,475 --> 01:02:36,495
- Keep it together.
- Get lost.

435
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:37,806
- Keep it together.
- Get lost.

436
01:02:37,915 --> 01:02:39,335
Keep your head together.

437
01:02:41,816 --> 01:02:42,804
Stop! Piss off!

438
01:02:43,015 --> 01:02:46,848
You're not there boy.
Look at me boy. Look at me!

439
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:12,971
Come on, boy.

440
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:27,446
Whore!

441
01:03:28,453 --> 01:03:30,284
Whore!

442
01:03:42,856 --> 01:03:49,293
These Christians arrived in our village
claiming to seek refuge.

443
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,650
This was their true purpose.

444
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:57,209
They came uninvited to our home
bringing malice and hatred.

445
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:59,767
These are God's gifts to us.

446
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:02,166
These are his words...

447
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:05,890
and these fine men his ambassadors.

448
01:04:07,131 --> 01:04:11,604
Thirteen centuries of control
and intimidation...

449
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,641
now gaze back at us through those bars.

450
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:49,005
We do not relish suffering.

451
01:04:49,211 --> 01:04:51,771
We do what we must to keep us safe.

452
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:59,563
The pestilence, the Christian disease, send
by your god to ravage his own people.

453
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:03,556
By spilling your Christian blood
the pestilence is kept away.

454
01:05:03,768 --> 01:05:07,317
You and your flock,
you believe that blasphemous filth?

455
01:05:07,526 --> 01:05:10,121
Kill us now, you bitch.
Get it over with.

456
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:13,240
I will offer you all the chance to live.

457
01:05:14,928 --> 01:05:17,917
Renounce your vengeful God,
and you will be free.

458
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:21,599
Keep him and you will die.

459
01:05:21,806 --> 01:05:24,797
Not one man here will bow down to you.

460
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:29,832
- I will die first.
- Who wants to live?

461
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:33,660
You?

462
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,486
I will fight Ulric
for the right to die first.

463
01:05:39,207 --> 01:05:40,924
Choose one.

464
01:06:09,003 --> 01:06:11,039
You will renounce.

465
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:17,989
I look forward to shagging
your mother's ass in hell.

466
01:06:18,922 --> 01:06:23,836
My mother is alive and she doesn't relish
the company of soldiers.

467
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,683
Come on.

468
01:06:29,884 --> 01:06:31,522
Come on, men.

469
01:06:31,724 --> 01:06:34,114
- Die well my friend.
- Oh, I will.

470
01:06:34,322 --> 01:06:35,836
Come on.

471
01:06:36,446 --> 01:06:39,592
My lady love and I,
we lived in joyeous sin...

472
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:43,590
now my lady love has got
the blackened skin.

473
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:47,432
Lady love and I,
we pour our love so brave...

474
01:06:47,643 --> 01:06:48,960
She says yeah.

475
01:06:49,161 --> 01:06:52,455
Now my lady love rots in an early grave.

476
01:06:52,657 --> 01:06:56,548
My lady love and I,
we lived in joyeous sin...

477
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,172
Now you will learn about pain.

478
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,976
Nothing you can teach me
about pain.

479
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,628
Don't look. Don't look. Hey, look away.

480
01:07:09,837 --> 01:07:11,634
Look away, boy.

481
01:07:17,278 --> 01:07:21,797
Blood of our blood, unholy trinity divine...

482
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,908
we offer this lamb slaughtering down...
