1
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,867
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

2
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,285
Up that rope!

3
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,662
Move it! Faster, faster!

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,830
Go, go, go!

5
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,561
Nice work.

6
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,438
At ease, Major.

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,898
You've won.

8
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,281
Never let your
guard down, Major,

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,076
even when you think you've won.

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,468
On behalf of
President Bosik and myself,

11
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,887
we are pleased to be
here today to announce

12
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,972
that we intend
to sign an agreement,

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,476
which will make Astovia
energy independent,

14
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,146
while providing clean oil
and gas for us

15
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,981
here at home in America.

16
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,983
-Hi, Uncle Sam.
-Hey.

17
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,572
That looked like it hurt.

18
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,907
It did.

19
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,991
He's a good teacher.

20
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,159
Hm.

21
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,453
I ran into your old buddy
Tobias Masters

22
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,330
at the general's
retirement party.

23
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,665
Mm, good old Toby.

24
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,542
He's quite proud of
the JSOC designation.

25
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,918
Yeah? Good for Toby.

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,003
I'm proud to be in MARSOC.

27
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,463
It's good enough for me.

28
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,257
You should be proud,

29
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,134
being one of the
first women selected

30
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,177
for Marine Corps
Special Operations.

31
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,554
It's no easy task.

32
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,516
Incidentally,
the general told me,

33
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,977
off the record,
of course,

34
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,521
that the JSOC selection,
it should've been you.

35
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,067
If you tell anyone that,
I'll disown you, okay?

36
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,193
I'm in your will?

37
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,862
Yeah, got
a couple ex-wives

38
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,363
that are hopin'
for a mention, but...

39
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,906
Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,032
But you are
my favorite niece.

41
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,492
I am your only niece.

42
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,707
You are my only anything
at this point, Allison.

43
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,959
Yeah, you too.

44
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,587
It is
important to usher nations

45
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,297
that are behind
the United States in progress

46
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,381
into the new world.

47
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,716
It's incredibly important

48
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,259
to give them the measures
they need.

49
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,470
So... still a big fan
of this president?

50
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,639
Don't even get me
started, Uncle Sam.

51
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,683
You know how I feel
about this guy.

52
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,144
Tell me why you
hate him so much.

53
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,770
I don't hate him.

54
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,482
I just... I don't think he
deserves to be where he's at.

55
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,984
The guy's had
everything in his life

56
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,861
handed to him
on a silver platter,

57
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,448
and yet preaches this campaign
of hard work and discipline?

58
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,158
Yeah, sure, I bet
life's pretty easy

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,451
when you've got
a safety net

60
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,369
like Dallas Edwards
was born into,

61
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,955
all money and connections.

62
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,165
Put that guy
in the real world,

63
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,000
he wouldn't get
elected dog catcher.

64
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,377
Well, the Falcon I know
is not the man you think he is.

65
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,629
Falcon?

66
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,547
Falcon's codename
for the president.

67
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,800
Okay, well, call him
whatever you want, Uncle Sam.

68
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,885
The man is soft.

69
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,054
I'd tell him to his face.

70
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,222
-Really?
-Hell yeah.

71
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,723
You might just be doing that.

72
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,517
Sure.

73
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,977
You ready to come work
for Uncle Sam?

74
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,647
I already work
for Uncle Sam.

75
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,315
Not in the military.

76
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,816
I meant me,

77
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,277
this Uncle Sam, Waitman.

78
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,571
Secret Service?

79
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,407
We are looking for someone
with your exact training,

80
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:06,204
and you are, by far,
everyone's favorite choice.

81
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,542
The answer is
either yes... or no.

82
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,421
Hell yes.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,493
What's on your mind?

84
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,539
I'm just thinking how

85
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,960
what makes the greats great
is how they handle pressure.

86
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,548
Lincoln was under pressure
his entire presidency,

87
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,967
the fate of the country
on his shoulders.

88
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,304
FDR was elected in
the middle of a depression,

89
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,597
then had to navigate
the world at war.

90
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,976
And Washington,
he navigated war,

91
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,644
navigated peace,

92
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,064
then just stepped
away from power

93
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,774
when he could've
simply kept it.

94
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,903
You act like you've
never been here before.

95
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,448
I mean, how many summertime
vacations did you take with me?

96
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,158
How many times did I take you

97
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,743
to the top of the
Washington Monument?

98
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,287
Well, that's different.
That's just vacation.

99
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,621
Oh.

100
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,915
Now, I live here.

101
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,546
So first day in Secret Service.

102
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,964
What am I doing?

103
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,632
How do you feel about coffee?

104
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,639
We've gone over this
time and time again, okay?

105
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,350
He's got his heels
dug in on this one.

106
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,310
Mark, you and I both know

107
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,020
this is going to be disastrous

108
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,438
for our partners in the region,

109
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,983
not to mention a public
relations nightmare!

110
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,110
You know
the president's position.

111
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,779
-But hey--
-Gentlemen.

112
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,822
-Mr. President.
-I'm sorry, Mr. President,

113
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,616
he insisted on
talking to you.

114
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,663
...Mr. President, is this really
what you want to do?

115
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,666
-Especially when Congress...
-Okay.

116
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,418
Doughnut patrol?

117
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,212
Yes, sir.

118
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,756
Everybody's gotta
start somewhere.

119
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,965
Yup.

120
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,342
By supporting President Bosik,

121
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885
we're helping to create
political stability

122
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,595
in a very important
corner of the world.

123
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,223
Eastern European cartels have
used the Astovian oil fields

124
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,350
as a piggy bank, funding
terrorism, narcotics,

125
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,185
trafficking--
anything and everything.

126
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,229
So no matter which way
you look at it,

127
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,897
it's the right thing to do.

128
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,982
Regarding the cartels, sir.

129
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,901
-Sir.
-You've seen the daily briefings.

130
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,112
All the back channel threats
against the United States,

131
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,655
against you, sir.

132
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,740
Since when has
the United States been afraid

133
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,743
of this cartel,
or any other, Mr. Jones?

134
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,585
What's the deal with all that?
Doesn't sound like

135
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,962
everyone agrees
with the president.

136
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,756
We don't do politics.
We do protection.

137
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,299
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Yes, sir.

138
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,676
Good morning,
Madam Vice President.

139
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,344
What about the promises
we made to our voters?

140
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,804
They expect us to do
things differently.

141
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,805
Nothing has changed.

142
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,348
Big picture, everyone.

143
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,850
But Mr. President,
are you really looking

144
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,810
to take on Congress this
early in your first term?

145
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,061
Did you hear the president?

146
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,438
You may not like it,

147
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,814
but you goddamn well
better get behind it.

148
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,649
As you no doubt already know,

149
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,318
today's agenda has Falcon
doing a political photo op

150
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,903
in the press room,

151
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,864
followed by an event
in the Rose Garden.

152
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,160
Agent strategic positioning
and details to follow.

153
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,454
Stay alert, stay ready.
Any questions?

154
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,332
Doughnut duty, huh?

155
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,794
Looks good on you, Miles.

156
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,091
So... what do you think
of our president?

157
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,178
I think he's the president.

158
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,471
Come on.

159
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,764
I know about what happened
with that, uh,

160
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,266
senator's nephew and you.

161
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,310
Somebody who didn't deserve it

162
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,479
got everything handed
to him,

163
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,439
just like Edwards.

164
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,483
I mean, the guy
was born into money.

165
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,860
He got preferential
treatment everywhere he went,

166
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,613
and, don't say anything,

167
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,406
but when his wife died,

168
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,991
he played the sympathy
card to get elected.

169
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,577
Wow.

170
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,205
We serve the chair,
not the man.

171
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,623
You sound like your uncle.

172
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,000
She sounds like somebody
who understands her job.

173
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,753
You know, in the future
you would do well

174
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,005
to keep your opinions to
yourself, Agent Richards.

175
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,215
Yes, sir.

176
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,675
All right, let's go, move.

177
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,886
Move out.

178
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,558
Good job keeping
your mouth shut.

179
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,353
When he gave you the opportunity
to say how you feel--

180
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,939
Look, what I said at
the bar was between us.

181
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,191
This is my job.

182
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,236
Well, technically, right now,
I think doughnut duty is my job.

183
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,779
Don't worry about
doughnut patrol.

184
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,447
It's something
we do for rookies.

185
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,032
Usually, there's a guy
from commissary

186
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,408
who handles
the doughnuts and coffee.

187
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,452
They do that to see
if you complain.

188
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,828
Complainers don't last long.

189
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,080
And I didn't complain.

190
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,623
Now, leave that be,
I already called.

191
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,250
Somebody from commissary
is gonna come pick that up.

192
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,585
Uncle Sam, I told you,
I don't want special treatment.

193
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,254
-I got this.
-Allison,

194
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,047
you're not getting
any special treatment.

195
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,759
I need you to go home,
pack your stuff,

196
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,302
and get some sleep, okay?

197
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,013
-I need you fresh tomorrow.
-What happens tomorrow?

198
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,099
One of my agents
called in sick,

199
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,684
so I need you on the team.

200
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,852
You're on Air Force One.

201
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,078
We need the trucks.
Bring the trucks out quickly.

202
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,330
Come on. Let's go!
Where are they?

203
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,748
We've been waiting for an hour!

204
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,084
When the general says
that we go, we go.

205
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,211
Come, follow me this way. Hurry.

206
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,177
We will, together, produce

207
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,931
clean, efficient oil and gas
for both of our nations

208
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,766
in the safest way possible.

209
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,228
And to consummate
our joint agreement,

210
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,896
and as a show of respect

211
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,898
and support
for President Bosik,

212
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,067
we will be meeting in Astovia

213
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,153
for the signing
of this historic deal.

214
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,071
Mr. President.

215
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,991
Thank you, Mr. President.

216
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,785
I'd like to say that the--

217
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:25,041
Toma Hasak, a man I
once counted as a friend,

218
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,084
and very intelligent person.

219
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,171
Why would you think that
I would ever allow you

220
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,550
to broker a deal with
Americans for our oil?

221
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,722
What do I always say, Bahrudin?

222
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,931
"It's all about oil."

223
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,976
Yeah, it's all about the oil.

224
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:48,147
Oil that, thanks to the deal
you helped arrange,

225
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,108
will now flow into American
hands instead of mine.

226
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,986
How much did they pay you?

227
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,696
They didn't pay me,
they didn't--

228
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,949
You and this puppet
president of ours,

229
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,243
you both sold out our country!

230
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,620
No, no, we didn't--

231
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,289
What?
What you say?

232
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,416
I'm not a traitor,
I'm not a traitor!

233
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,752
-I'm not hearing you.
-I'm not a traitor!

234
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,463
Take off this tape
that I can hear him.

235
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,550
What?

236
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,761
-I love my country.
-You love your country?

237
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,807
It's funny way
how you show it, huh?

238
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,143
But I do!
I never steal a cent.

239
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,146
This deal... this deal
will be good for us,

240
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,482
if only you give it a chance.

241
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,943
You are a fool
if you believe that,

242
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,779
a fool who betrayed
his own people.

243
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,781
Shoot this idiot.

244
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,449
No!

245
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,826
No, don't!

246
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,036
This is great for
both of our nations,

247
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,788
and we, uh, will work--

248
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:54,046
President Edwards
is right about one thing.

249
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,926
Tomorrow's going to be historic.

250
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,471
We are in.

251
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,416
Hello?

252
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,668
Honey?

253
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,798
Guys?

254
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,552
Daddy.

255
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,975
You're going to call in sick
for tomorrow's flight.

256
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,312
I don't see you
picking up the phone.

257
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,231
Pick up the phone!

258
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,607
Okay.

259
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,655
Daddy?

260
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,079
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Martinez.

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,581
I have a family emergency
I need to address.

262
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,252
I won't be making
tomorrow's itinerary.

263
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,255
Correct.

264
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,966
Tell Dan I appreciate it.

265
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,303
They're calling in a backup
named Dan Smith.

266
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,513
He's brand-new.

267
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,640
This will be his first flight.

268
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,935
-Daddy!
-I know.

269
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,479
No, Daddy!
Daddy, no!

270
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,730
No!

271
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,504
Falcon will arrive
in ten minutes.

272
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,320
-We are ready?
-Yes, sir.

273
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,448
We're going to
fuck these Americans.

274
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,910
No, that is not
what we are here for.

275
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,954
We are here to take back
our country,

276
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,958
and to do that, we need the oil,

277
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,419
which give us the money

278
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,504
that give us the power

279
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,882
to do what we need to do.

280
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,759
And then,

281
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,053
and then, yes,

282
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,556
we will fuck these Americans
until they bleed.

283
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,602
Yes.

284
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,291
You waiting for an invitation?

285
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,512
Check the front hatch.

286
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,472
Make sure everything's
secure before we take off.

287
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,849
Sorry, I promise I'll get
my head out of the clouds

288
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,851
in a minute,
but this is just...

289
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,228
I know, it's quite a sight

290
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,854
when you see it
for the first time.

291
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,692
You, you got me that model
when I was a kid, remember?

292
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,901
Of course.

293
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,528
Still have it.

294
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,782
Is everything all right?

295
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,535
Well, Agent Richards
is a no-show.

296
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,120
We have two people
that haven't checked in.

297
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,413
Are we covered?

298
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,831
Of course, we always
have people on hand

299
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,166
for, you know, last-minute
contingency stuff.

300
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,877
But you don't like last-minute
contingency stuff.

301
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,088
Well, I like when things
go according to plan A.

302
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,506
Even though you
always have a plan B.

303
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,841
Hell, I usually have a plan Z,

304
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,801
but I'm a big fan of plan A.

305
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,220
Here comes Falcon.

306
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,851
Mr. President!

307
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm gonna get coffee,

308
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,147
get a little bit of work done,
and there'll be plenty of time

309
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,066
for all of your questions.

310
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,612
Afternoon, gonna get a cup
of coffee, finish the brief,

311
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,654
and then we'll get to work.

312
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,118
Sam, better break this one in.

313
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,411
Yes, sir.

314
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,455
-Morning, Mr. President.
-James.

315
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
Good morning,
Mr. President.

316
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,876
-Hello, Charlotte.
-Okay, what'd I do?

317
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,420
The president isn't
big on formalities.

318
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,839
-So no saluting.
-No saluting.

319
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,466
Right.

320
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,301
Morning, Mr. President.

321
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,435
Just enough time for the
president to finish his coffee.

322
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,062
Good afternoon,
Mr. President.

323
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,189
Greetings to all of you
flying with us today.

324
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,525
We have about ten minutes
before we depart,

325
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,653
so if you can find your seats
and finish up your last task,

326
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,947
we'll let you know
before we take off.

327
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,461
Prepare cabin for takeoff.

328
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,558
Air Force One,
you're clear for takeoff.

329
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,967
Andrews Air Force Base,
this is Air Force One, over.

330
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,101
Andrews Air Force Base,
this is Air Force...

331
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,104
Come in, please.

332
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,823
The plane is ours.

333
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,581
Astovian press first.

334
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,333
You have a question?

335
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,084
Thank you, Mr. President.

336
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,920
Amar Hozman of the
Novaya Pravda News,

337
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,006
and if I might ask,
why are you doing this?

338
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,883
Your country claims
it wants to go green,

339
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,594
and yet you invade other
countries for their oil.

340
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,679
No one is planning

341
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,389
to invade your country,
and you know that.

342
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,100
I was asked to enter into
this deal by your president,

343
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,062
and I agreed, because it is
one that I believe in strongly.

344
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,648
Simply, there are things
that you can do,

345
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,275
things that you should do,
and things that you must do.

346
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,444
This is something
that we must do.

347
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,905
President Bosik and I
have negotiated a deal

348
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,823
that is equally beneficial
to both of our countries.

349
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,492
It creates many new jobs
for Astovians,

350
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,078
which gives you greater economic
freedom and independence,

351
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,414
and makes you a better strategic
partner for us in the region.

352
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,416
-Thank you for your question.
-Mr. President, sir!

353
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,751
Jennifer.

354
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,044
What's wrong?

355
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,338
Trying to send an email.

356
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,590
Internet's gone down.

357
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,841
Is that normal?

358
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,843
Not on Air Force One.

359
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,976
It's all yours, General.

360
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,106
Good evening, Air Force One.

361
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,984
Mr. President,

362
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:21,363
my name is Azem Rodinov.
General Rodinov.

363
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,740
I believe you heard of me.

364
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,284
Sam, what the fuck is this?

365
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,453
President Edwards,

366
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,706
your plane has been hijacked.

367
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,958
All communications
have been blocked.

368
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,712
No cellular
or satellite service

369
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,089
can penetrate this hub.

370
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,716
And right now,

371
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,968
Andrews Air Force Base

372
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,637
is tracking a radar ghost

373
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,932
that assures them
you are on course.

374
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:53,061
I'll be back in touch shortly
to let you know our demands.

375
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,523
You two, let's go, move.
Move out.

376
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,402
But for now,
what is it you Americans say?

377
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,197
"Sit back and enjoy the ride."

378
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,658
You two, get Falcon
to a secure location now.

379
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,702
I don't wanna go to a
goddamn secure location.

380
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,746
Mr. President, I don't tell
you how to run the country.

381
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,914
Please don't tell me
how to protect you.

382
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,624
Don't they have fail-safes?

383
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,043
Lead on.

384
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,087
All right, you're with me.

385
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,172
The rest of you sit down,

386
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,465
and don't do a damn thing!

387
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,841
Stay seated!

388
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,967
Are you okay?

389
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,302
You're in charge
'til I get back.

390
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,429
Secure this location.
Let's roll.

391
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,249
What's the matter?

392
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,586
I have asthma.

393
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,881
I need my inhaler.

394
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,270
What's your plan Z,
Uncle Sam?

395
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,980
First, we have to
take the plane back.

396
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,859
Mr. President,
as you have no doubt surmised,

397
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,361
we have taken your plane.

398
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,364
By now, you are probably
in a secure location.

399
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,574
My colleagues have
taken as hostage

400
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,994
all your staffers and
journalists traveling with us.

401
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,496
No, please!

402
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,748
And all of you
in the Secret Service

403
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,667
who might still be out there...

404
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,711
you need to understand this.

405
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,673
Air Force One is ours.

406
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,113
Will they see
what's happening

407
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,782
to Air Force One
at Andrews Base?

408
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,826
The only thing
Andrews can see

409
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,453
is what we want them
to see.

410
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,096
Hold on.

411
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,681
Mr. President,

412
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,725
the people who have
taken control of your plane

413
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,560
are willing to die
to get what they want.

414
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,228
Goddamn it.

415
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,689
Any attempt to try
and regain control

416
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,900
of this plane
is going to be futile,

417
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,820
and ultimately fatal
for everyone on the plane.

418
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,532
So right now, I'm going to give
you one minute, Mr. President,

419
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,993
to rejoin
the rest of the hostages,

420
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,580
at which point,
we'll start shooting them.

421
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,007
Forty seconds,
Mr. President.

422
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,014
Twenty seconds.

423
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,351
Ten seconds.

424
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,313
Five.

425
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,109
Wait!

426
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,653
No!

427
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,198
Tell your agents to
put their weapons down.

428
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,954
Must I remind you gentlemen
who controls this plane?

429
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,665
Put your weapons down!

430
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,007
All right, listen.

431
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,300
We gotta split up.

432
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,843
That is not a good idea.

433
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,845
You're faster,
more mobile than I am.

434
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,430
I'm only gonna slow you down.

435
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,849
-Protect the president.
-What about the hostages?

436
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,434
I'll go check on them.

437
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,645
Remember, kid,
you only have one job.

438
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,273
Uncle Sam.

439
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,819
Go.

440
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,911
The general would like
to speak to you in private.

441
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,497
Please!
No, please!

442
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,985
President Edwards.

443
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,574
Rodinov.

444
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,909
General Rodinov.

445
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,413
You're not
a general of anything, Azem.

446
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,581
You're a war criminal.

447
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,085
One man's war criminal
is another man's hero,

448
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,714
and in my country,
I am a hero.

449
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,799
Your people fear you.

450
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,093
They don't admire you.

451
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,305
For my people,
fear inspires respect.

452
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:24,934
Listen, Mr. President. You will
announce from Air Force One

453
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,271
that you are pulling
out of your deal

454
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,690
with this fake president,

455
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,818
and you will say that
you have realized

456
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,029
the election was stolen,

457
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,614
and if you agree with me,

458
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,076
then the world will
stop paying attention.

459
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,245
You have one hour.

460
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,958
After that, we start
killing the hostages.

461
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,629
And if you say no,

462
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,924
I'll simply kill all of you.

463
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,968
I'm not a murderer.

464
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,471
Don't make me have
to become one.

465
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,435
My man is going to
wait with you

466
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,356
just in case you are thinking
of trying to be heroic.

467
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,527
And remember,
Mr. President...

468
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,154
one hour.

469
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,336
I'm guessing you're not
a real journalist.

470
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,737
Sit down.

471
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,579
You are lucky the general
wants you untouched.

472
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,665
For now, anyway.

473
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,676
Mark, can I speak
to you for a moment?

474
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,677
Of course.

475
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,478
I'm sorry to bother you, Mark,
but during dinner

476
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,273
I emailed the president,
and CC'd a couple key staffers.

477
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,983
May I ask about what?

478
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,110
About the oil deal
we're making with Astovia.

479
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,320
I know,

480
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,988
but I still
have deep reservations,

481
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,366
and I wanted to make sure my
position is clear in writing

482
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,659
before this deal goes through.

483
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,620
-And?
-That's the thing.

484
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,747
Somebody should've
gotten back to me by now,

485
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,832
even if it was to tell me
the decision was made,

486
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,918
and it's too late
to make a change.

487
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,711
I should've gotten a response.

488
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,338
That's unusual.

489
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,631
I know.

490
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,091
I don't like unusual.

491
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,141
Can you patch me through to
air traffic control at Andrews?

492
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,271
This is Andrews
air traffic control.

493
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,606
What can we do for you,
Mr. Miller?

494
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,941
I'm with the vice president.

495
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,859
We need you to check
on something for us.

496
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,946
Air Force One, this is
Andrews Air Force Base

497
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,198
air traffic control.
Please acknowledge, over.

498
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,285
Andrews, this is
Air Force One, go ahead.

499
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,746
Air Force One, we have
Vice President Hansen

500
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,999
and Chief of Staff Miller
on the line.

501
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,085
Good evening,
Madam Vice President,

502
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,294
Mr. Miller.

503
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,712
-Evening.
-Good evening.

504
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,172
If this is about
the president,

505
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,383
he's got everybody watching
The Godfather.

506
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,177
Again?

507
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,512
How many times is this?

508
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,888
I lost count.

509
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,140
The president wants to know
if this is important,

510
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,350
or if it can wait.

511
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,895
It can wait.

512
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,065
Roger that. We'll get back
to you when it's over.

513
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,650
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

514
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,236
We're good.

515
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,988
Air Force One
signing off.

516
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,575
Well done, Dmitri.

517
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,684
Fucking Secret Service.

518
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,941
I am going hunting.

519
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,955
We have to get you to safety,
Mr. President.

520
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,923
Are you okay?

521
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,969
It's pretty cold
where we're headed.

522
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,303
Grab your coat.

523
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,272
Don't move!

524
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,066
Where's your niece?

525
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,400
Who?

526
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,360
Don't play ignorant
with me, Mr. Waitman.

527
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,112
I'm running
a military operation,

528
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,989
and my intel is good.

529
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,532
We know she's your niece.

530
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,077
Now, where's Allison Miles?

531
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,038
I don't know.

532
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,306
It's your first time
on Air Force One.

533
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,100
How did you even
know this was here?

534
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,893
Stayed up and read the manual.

535
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,603
Of course you did.

536
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,832
Yes?

537
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,958
Vlady has gone dark,

538
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,709
and isn't answering
at his post.

539
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,838
The president is free with
the last Secret Service agent.

540
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,965
Put the plane on autopilot,

541
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,341
and get to
the emergency exit

542
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,135
in case they try
to get out that way.

543
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,636
I'm on it.

544
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,182
Fuck you.

545
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,976
Yeah, we'll see about that.

546
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,276
I've run out of
patience, Agent Waitman.

547
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,778
You're either going to tell
your niece to surrender,

548
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,366
or I'm going to litter this
floor with dead bodies!

549
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,744
What about the hostages?

550
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,080
You really think they're
gonna let anyone off alive?

551
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,374
Of course not.
Even if I do what Rodinov asks,

552
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,792
I don't think he's
gonna let anyone live.

553
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,335
That's why it's up to us
to save the passengers.

554
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,588
No, sir, it is our job
to get you off this plane.

555
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,423
You might be the president,
but with all due respect, sir,

556
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,009
right now, I am the only
Secret Service you've got left.

557
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,636
You say exactly what
I told you to say,

558
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,597
or you're all dead.

559
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,225
Agent Allison Miles?

560
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,727
We have your uncle here.

561
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,398
And he has something
he wants to tell you.

562
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,649
Allison!

563
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,276
Allison,
we serve the chair,

564
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,028
not the man.

565
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,323
You protect Falcon at all costs.

566
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,051
Well, I guess that's one down,

567
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,385
and, uh...

568
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,638
none to go.

569
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,357
Agent Miles--

570
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,942
Sir, we have to get you
off this plane.

571
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,652
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,700
You all right, sir?

573
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,870
It's nothing.

574
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,832
-We're gonna have to jump.
-Do we have a choice?

575
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,125
No.

576
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,245
That fucking bitch.

577
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,964
General Rodinov, over.
Air Force One--

578
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,757
You're breaking up.
Please repeat.

579
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,593
President Edwards
has escaped Air Force One

580
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,512
with a Secret Service Agent.

581
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,139
Why are you
still on the plane?

582
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,017
Agent Allison Miles,
he's with her.

583
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,896
She's the only one
left with the president.

584
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,907
What now, General?

585
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,952
Show me the map of the area

586
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,704
they might have come down.

587
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,665
Based on the flight path,

588
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,375
they would be somewhere
in this valley.

589
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,835
I see.

590
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,921
In 30 minutes, I want you
to kill the signal.

591
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,549
What do they know
back at Andrews?

592
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,217
Until I tell them,
they will think

593
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,178
that the plane
is still in the air.

594
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,555
They'll start a search
in the wrong place,

595
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,100
and by the time they
figure out what's happened,

596
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,352
it will be too late.

597
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,646
Hail to the chief,
American pig fucks.

598
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,042
Air Force One, come in.

599
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,046
Air Force One, this is Andrews
Air Force Base, come in.

600
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,465
Oh, my God.

601
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,894
-Hello?
-I'm sorry to wake you,

602
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,104
Madam Vice President.

603
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,230
It's Mark Miller.

604
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,066
What is it, Mark?

605
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,652
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

606
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,572
Madam Vice President.

607
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,867
What has happened?

608
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,494
We're still gathering intel.

609
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,746
We're coordinating the search
with President Bosik.

610
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,456
The search?

611
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,624
For survivors?

612
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,292
For bodies,
Madam Vice President.

613
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,628
It's unlikely anyone
survived the crash.

614
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,171
Unlikely.

615
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,548
Highly, ma'am.

616
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,633
Very well.

617
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,969
Mark, I'm gonna need you
on a plane to Astovia

618
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,470
in the next two hours.

619
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,514
A plane?
To do what?

620
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,099
You're going to
reassure President Bosik

621
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,351
that America honors
its commitments.

622
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,477
Are you certain?

623
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,147
We both know that you never
agreed with President Edwards

624
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,231
about the oil deal.

625
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,983
My very first act
as president

626
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,694
is not to revoke President
Edwards' signature deal.

627
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,736
Understood.

628
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,677
We need to figure out
where the hell we are.

629
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,929
Pardon my language,
Mr. President.

630
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,893
Oh, I've been known
to say a bit worse.

631
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,352
And I wish you'd
call me Dallas.

632
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,812
Can't do that, sir.

633
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,151
We're surrounded
by mountains.

634
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,486
We're gonna have to
get to higher ground

635
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,862
if we want a chance
at a signal.

636
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,405
I'm in your hands,
Agent Miles, lead on.

637
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,639
Can we get
the trucks out here going?

638
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,076
Let me know if this pace
is all right, Mr. President.

639
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,869
We don't have time
to stop.

640
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,497
I'm fine, Agent Miles.

641
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,792
Unless you need a break,
we should keep moving.

642
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,211
Yes, sir.

643
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,109
Well, we're still
surrounded by mountains

644
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,944
and it'll be getting dark soon.

645
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,531
This is probably our best bet
to bunk down for the night.

646
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,967
Clear.

647
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,637
All right, Mr. President.

648
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,642
Let's get you patched up.

649
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,566
I've got some
water heating, sir.

650
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,152
We should both get cleaned up
before I close your wound.

651
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,902
Mr. President,
there's, um...

652
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,780
there's something
you should consider.

653
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,784
The hijackers wouldn't
have been able

654
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,952
to take the plane
without help.

655
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,209
They had someone on the inside
that gave them everything.

656
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,588
Schedules, security codes,

657
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,174
passwords, everything.

658
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,386
And for them to have
all that,

659
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,638
it would have to be
someone close to you.

660
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,396
There's only a few people
in the world that it could be,

661
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,564
and I don't wanna believe
that it's any of 'em.

662
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:01,323
I'm better with, um, doing
these things than fixing them.

663
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,665
That'll have to do 'til we
get you to a real doctor.

664
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,877
Thank you.

665
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,212
Of course.

666
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,104
You know, it occurs to me
that, uh,

667
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,151
you've been running all over
the place saving my life.

668
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,613
You haven't had any time
to process your loss.

669
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,366
Mr. President, my uncle
would never forgive me

670
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,160
if I didn't do my job.

671
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,997
And I would never
forgive myself

672
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,832
if I let Sam down.

673
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:56,545
So I need you to just
let me do my job.

674
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,135
Does that make any sense?

675
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,470
Absolutely.

676
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,557
A lot of people died
in the last 24 hours,

677
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,643
Sam, and everyone else
that was on that plane,

678
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,687
each of them
someone that I know.

679
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,523
So we owe it to them.

680
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,110
We're not gonna let
the bad guys win.

681
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,618
You sound like my uncle.

682
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:35,667
That's the best compliment
you could give me, Agent Miles.

683
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,608
Did you know that your uncle
wasn't a big fan of mine

684
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,235
when he and I first met?

685
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,237
He never
mentioned that, sir.

686
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,072
Well, he wouldn't, would he?

687
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,950
No, he would not.

688
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,788
Well, he never said so much,
but I suspect that Sam thought

689
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,749
that I had everything handed
to me on a silver platter.

690
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,043
Sam didn't think that, sir.

691
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,213
-That's what everybody thinks.
-Sam respected you, sir.

692
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,673
We respected each other.

693
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,343
All my life people
have judged me

694
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,387
based on what they
think that they know.

695
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,514
I come from money.

696
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,057
Everybody knows that.

697
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,644
What they don't know is
that right before college

698
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,231
I had a terrible fight
with my father,

699
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:44,444
and I did not take
one penny of his money.

700
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,905
He wanted to dictate
every step that I took,

701
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,657
and of course I had
to choose my own path,

702
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,744
so I worked two jobs,
I put myself through school,

703
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,205
finished ROTC,

704
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,457
and then I flew jets
for the Air Force.

705
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,378
After the service,
I ran for Congress, and I won,

706
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,797
and what helped me
was the lesson

707
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,301
that I took from
that fight with my old man,

708
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,012
and it's the one that
I carry with me to this day.

709
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,266
And that's that you can't
make everybody happy.

710
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,895
So you just gotta do
what you think is right.

711
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,234
Why don't you let
your campaign managers

712
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,777
tell that story to the press?

713
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,866
I think the work
defines the man,

714
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,285
not the story.

715
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,751
My whole life I knew I was
gonna serve my country.

716
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,629
My dad was a Marine.

717
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,384
I barely remember him.

718
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,141
Was an IED,
early days of Iraq,

719
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,310
and, uh...

720
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,314
Well, Sam...

721
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,818
Sam was the black sheep
of our family

722
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,198
for being in the Secret Service,
and not a military lifer.

723
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,410
But he was the only one

724
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,121
who didn't try and talk me
out of joining the Service.

725
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,170
It's in my blood.

726
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,423
Even if I-I wanted
to do something else,

727
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,217
I genuinely don't think I could.

728
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,303
Guess the truth is I...

729
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,848
I don't want
to do anything else.

730
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,937
Me neither.

731
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,611
I'm sorry.

732
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,738
What for?

733
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,198
For judging you.

734
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,201
I'm one of those people.

735
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,538
Everybody is one of those people
until they learn not to be.

736
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,962
I'll take the first watch.

737
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,424
Get some sleep, Mr. President.
You're gonna need it tomorrow.

738
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,883
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
Mr. President.

739
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,135
No apology necessary.

740
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,558
You'll never guess what they
put in the survival pack.

741
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,978
Care for some coffee?

742
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,605
Uh, yes, please.

743
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,217
Don't move.

744
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,975
Some people just don't listen.

745
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,277
Stand down, Agent Miles.

746
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,404
This is not a fight we can win.

747
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,646
How's that head feel?

748
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,398
I've been better, sir.

749
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,735
I think, at this point,

750
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,612
you should start
calling me Dallas.

751
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,113
Can't do that, sir.

752
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,740
Just like your uncle.

753
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,366
Certainly hope so.

754
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,707
I can see that
he's taught you so much.

755
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,920
I'm sorry.

756
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,797
It's not fair to lose
someone that close to you.

757
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,175
He taught me everything.

758
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,430
He told me once,
"If life was fair,

759
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,849
the world wouldn't
need people like us."

760
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,646
He was, um, trying to soften
the blow over some thing

761
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,314
I got passed over years ago.

762
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,566
Tobias Masters?

763
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,319
You know about Toby?

764
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,445
Of course.

765
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,571
His uncle, the senator,

766
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,740
is an insufferable prick,

767
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,660
and from what I gather,
so is the nephew.

768
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,037
-How do you know all that?
-Because I know everything

769
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,747
about the people around me,
Agent Miles.

770
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,377
Now, you tell me,

771
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,089
what would Sam Waitman
do in this situation?

772
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,386
Formulate a plan, or 26,

773
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,388
to get Falcon outta here safely.

774
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,015
Oh, that's you, by the way.

775
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,560
I think I know
my own codename.

776
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,689
And that sounds just like Sam.

777
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,776
Problem is this ain't
The Count of Monte Cristo.

778
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,738
We don't have time to
dig a secret tunnel out. So...

779
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,116
Our best bet is gonna be

780
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,118
to make a play for time,
Mr. President.

781
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,913
Rodinov may say he's a general,
but he's a thug.

782
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,708
Sooner or later,
he will make a mistake.

783
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,959
And if he does?

784
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,295
Not if, sir, when.

785
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,134
And it'll be the last mistake
he ever makes.

786
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,473
Come.

787
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,861
What's wrong?

788
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,240
-Speak.
-American Vice President

789
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,492
has announced her plan to honor
her predecessor's deal

790
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,077
with Bosik.

791
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,247
What about the high command?

792
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,666
The high command
will not rally to your side

793
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,044
as long as deal is in place.

794
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,216
We have work to do.

795
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,614
Mr. President,
you will come now.

796
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,127
I'll walk on my own.

797
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,788
Hi.

798
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,669
You know what
this place used to be?

799
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,255
A dairy processing plant.

800
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,464
And what happened?

801
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,509
It was bought by
an American company,

802
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,304
who sold off machines,
closed the plant,

803
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,057
and started selling
German milk.

804
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,438
We didn't need
German milk.

805
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,399
Now, it's all we drink.

806
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,901
You were still general.

807
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,194
The military owned everything

808
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,447
back when this factory
was sold off, yes?

809
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,115
What of it?

810
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,409
I know how things
worked under you.

811
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,078
Anyone wishing to do business
here had to pay you off.

812
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,623
The factory was
supposed to remain open.

813
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,000
They lied to me!

814
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,585
Now, you're just
complaining

815
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,170
that they're better
crooks than you.

816
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,547
You think I was stealing
from my own country?

817
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,674
It was capitalism,

818
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,385
and you Americans
gave it to us.

819
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,929
Your government
wanted us to get rich,

820
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,848
forget who we are,
who we were.

821
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:01,102
You know nothing about
our history, about our life,

822
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,687
our culture, religion.

823
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,982
You people
turn us into you,

824
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,486
and hate what you see.

825
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:13,323
Know what? I would like
to kill you right now.

826
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,330
But I will not kill you,

827
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,874
because I'm smart.

828
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,129
So let us try

829
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,132
and be civilized about this.

830
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,844
Shall we?

831
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,774
I was hoping we might
find a middle ground.

832
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,401
I don't think so.

833
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,990
Here we are.

834
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,202
You did it your way, huh?

835
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,828
Cheers.

836
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,505
You know what I need from you?

837
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,423
Why don't you tell me?

838
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:17,303
Your vice president has
done some unexpected thing.

839
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,889
We were sure that she
would kill your deal

840
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,849
with our fake president,

841
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,685
but she has announced

842
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,896
that she plans to honor
your agreement,

843
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,399
and, uh, it will not be good.

844
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,777
So you will kill this deal

845
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,573
in a recorded video statement
that we will release.

846
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,828
Well, I hate to spoil your plan,
but I will not do that.

847
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,081
I think you will.

848
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,083
Beat me all you want.

849
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,544
Kill me, if need be.

850
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,923
But I will not be threatened.

851
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,843
I know you won't,
Mr. President,

852
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:01,014
but I'm not threatening you,
understand?

853
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,434
I realize...

854
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,228
you are ready to die

855
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,272
on this stupid hill.

856
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:20,491
But imagine the young woman...

857
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:25,580
who has gone through hell
trying to protect you.

858
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,581
Nice knife.

859
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:32,712
Now, imagine I turn
my men loose on her.

860
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,272
You won't enjoy this.

861
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,569
My men will rape
Special Agent Miles for hours,

862
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,322
and hours...

863
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,700
...and hours.

864
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,672
When they are not raping her,

865
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,007
they will torture her.

866
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:25,723
She will get to a point
where she prays to die.

867
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,477
But I will not grant her

868
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,270
pleasure of death.

869
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,738
I will keep her alive
indefinitely.

870
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,243
And I will force you to watch.

871
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,502
Every night,

872
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,423
my personal physician will
give her a blood transfusion,

873
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:02,385
if necessary,
to keep her alive.

874
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,846
And the next day,

875
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,849
it will start all over again,

876
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,016
and again,

877
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:13,146
and... again.

878
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,198
I will not give you
what you want,

879
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,284
but I am prepared
to make a statement

880
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,786
that the people of Astovia
should have the right

881
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,873
to vote on whether the oil
venture moves forward or not,

882
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,541
-and that's it.
-No!

883
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,586
You will do it
exactly as I say,

884
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,630
and you will do it
in presidential manner.

885
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,925
What are you
so afraid of, General?

886
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,643
You will let me
make my statement,

887
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:58,483
and then you can tell
the people anything you like,

888
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:01,444
and if you know them
as well as you say that you do,

889
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:06,199
I have no doubt that
they will rise up

890
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,202
and stand behind you.

891
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:12,747
Listen, if you
don't do what I want,

892
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,625
my man, Bahrudin,

893
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:19,295
will flay the skin
off Agent Miles

894
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,381
one inch at a time.

895
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,426
I've seen him do it.

896
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,845
Now, tell me,

897
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,724
do you think I'm lying?

898
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,280
You know what?

899
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,492
You will look presentable
for this announcement.

900
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,118
Come.

901
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,336
Very nice, yeah.

902
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,417
Ready?

903
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,711
Listen, Mr. President,

904
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,671
if you try and change it,

905
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,840
we'll just start
recording again.

906
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,217
And Mr. President...

907
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,512
I need a good performance.

908
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:40,686
The moment you've said what
you're supposed to say,

909
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,399
I'll call off my men,
and she can go free.

910
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,489
Yosef, what's happened?

911
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,832
Sounds like she is already.

912
01:09:58,569 --> 01:09:59,778
She's up there!

913
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,617
Shoot her, shoot her!

914
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,914
Don't let her get away!

915
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:11,999
Where is the machine gun?

916
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,146
Looks like you're
outnumbered, General.

917
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,316
You lose.

918
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,026
You are still my hostage.

919
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,319
I've lost nothing.

920
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,570
You've lost everything.

921
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,989
You just don't know it yet.

922
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:48,077
The difference between us
is that you are soft,

923
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,080
because you are weak.

924
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,665
And I am not.

925
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,875
I am ready to fight.

926
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,087
I will kill anyone in my way.

927
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:03,759
I'll kill thousands,
tens of thousands,

928
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,554
for the justice of my people
and my country.

929
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,015
That is why I will win.

930
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:13,185
That is why you will
most certainly lose.

931
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,569
You grow tiresome,
Agent Miles.

932
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,210
We're done here.

933
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,309
Thanks...

934
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,144
Dallas.

935
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,982
-You're welcome.
-Yeah.

936
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,443
Yeah, don't get used
to it, all right?

937
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,403
I won't.

938
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,740
This is Special Agent
Allison Miles.

939
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,366
Falcon is safe and secure.

940
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,201
I repeat, I have Falcon secure.

941
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:14,163
Need extraction coordinates
immediately, over.

942
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,337
Falcon's alive.
I repeat, Falcon's alive.

943
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,672
I have the coordinates
of the president's location.

944
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,799
Chief of Staff Mark Miller
is in the area,

945
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,092
and is on his way.

946
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,469
Air Force activated.

947
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,804
That-that-that's great news.

948
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,057
Send me the coordinates.

949
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,683
We're nearby.
We'll head right there.

950
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,141
Mr. President!

951
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,811
-Mark!
-It's good to see you alive!

952
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:24,066
Mark Miller...

953
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,194
Special Agent Allison Miles.

954
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,612
A large portion of
the president's survival

955
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,988
can be chalked up to you,
Agent Miles.

956
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,990
Just doing my job, sir.

957
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,243
Mr. President, we need
to debrief you immediately

958
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:35,911
so that we can
issue a statement.

959
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,746
There's a small airfield east,
which we'll take off from,

960
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,415
and he can take care
of wounds while we talk.

961
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:40,541
Treat Agent Miles first.

962
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,750
-Sir, I--
-Sir--

963
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,585
Oh! I have not
asked either of you

964
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:45,045
for your opinion on this matter.

965
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,047
You'll treat Agent Miles first.
That's an order.

966
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,424
Yes, sir.

967
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:50,342
-I'd like to stay with you--
-Miles.

968
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,387
You're off duty.

969
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:57,307
-Sir, with all due--
-At ease, Agent Miles.

970
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:01,937
At ease.

971
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,313
You've won.

972
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,363
Never let your
guard down, Major,

973
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,949
even when you think
you've won.

974
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,142
Mr. President, what happened?

975
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,271
All right, let's get
a look at that wound.

976
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,444
I'll tell you
the story later on.

977
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,447
So you're JSOC, huh?

978
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,990
That's right.

979
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,117
How's good old
Toby Masters doing?

980
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,745
Toby, yeah, I know him.

981
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:02,414
He's good, just saw him
last week at a briefing.

982
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,668
Then you know,
uh, Scott Gray, too.

983
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,962
He went over there with
Toby to be his adjutant.

984
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,214
You know, Scotty?

985
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,174
Yeah, Scotty.
Sure, I know him.

986
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,967
-Yeah.
-Yeah, hell of a guy.

987
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,016
Miles!

988
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:22,684
One of these men
claimed to know a soldier

989
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,228
named Scott Gray, sir.

990
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,146
So you shot him?

991
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,147
Scott Gray doesn't exist, sir.

992
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,440
I made him up.

993
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,276
Miller isn't here to
save you, Mr. President.

994
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,903
He's here to kill you.

995
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,196
Allison...

996
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,490
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

997
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,745
Your chief of staff is the one
who betrayed you, Mr. President.

998
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,622
Bet you never agreed
with that deal

999
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,707
that President Edwards made
with President Bosik, did you?

1000
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,001
No, he didn't,
but none of 'em did.

1001
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,670
Maybe so.

1002
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,838
But this idiot's the only one
who's willing to kill for it.

1003
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,382
Is that true?

1004
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,010
Gonna kill me over
a fuckin' energy deal?

1005
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,555
I never would've expected this,
but someone had to act.

1006
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:02,307
You went all in
on backing Bosik,

1007
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,017
so I did the same
in backing Rodinov.

1008
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,227
Something had to be done.

1009
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,688
-Why?
-Because you betrayed us,

1010
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,189
everyone who believed in you.

1011
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,899
We were supposed to
do things different.

1012
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,401
We thought that you
were the future,

1013
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,653
and then you just
went right back

1014
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,780
to the same old, same old,
making deals for oil.

1015
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,116
In my wildest dreams...

1016
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:22,828
I never would've thought that
you could've done this to me,

1017
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,621
or to our country,

1018
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:27,207
or to those innocent people
on that plane.

1019
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,750
Put that gun down
or I'll kill him!

1020
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,294
Agent Miles, do not
relinquish your weapon!

1021
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,170
Marcus, look at me.

1022
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,007
You're not a killer.

1023
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:37,509
Yesterday, that was true.

1024
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,720
But I can't let you
walk away from this.

1025
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:41,930
You died in that crash.

1026
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,473
You want me dead?

1027
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,559
Okay then, go on.

1028
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,063
Do it.

1029
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,696
Agent Miles, if he does,
you take him down.

1030
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,197
Yes, sir!

1031
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,160
Or better yet, take him alive,

1032
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,245
where you will stand
trial for treason.

1033
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,705
Either way...

1034
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:09,416
it's up to you, Mark.

1035
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,893
Fuck it.

1036
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:43,992
Mr. President.

1037
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,455
Can we get the hell
out of this place?

1038
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,873
Absolutely, sir.

1039
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,244
Cavalry's on the way.

1040
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:29,246
Extraction team says
they'll be here in 30.

1041
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,421
Why wait?

1042
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,967
Are you sure
about that, sir?

1043
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:44,219
They don't call me
Falcon for nothing.

1044
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:46,346
This...

1045
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:48,682
This I got.

1046
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,890
This is
Ramstein Air Base calling

1047
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,184
unidentified aircraft
approaching our airspace.

1048
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:34,060
Please identify.

1049
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,229
Ramstein Air Base,
this is Air Force One

1050
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,689
requesting permission to land.

1051
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,107
I have Falcon on board.

1052
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,193
Say again?

1053
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:43,236
Ramstein, this is Air Force One,

1054
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,781
code delta-five-eagle
one-niner-delta-two,

1055
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:47,574
requesting permission to land.

1056
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:48,950
I have Falcon on board.

1057
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:51,036
Ramstein, this is
President Dallas Edwards

1058
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:52,871
on board Air Force One.

1059
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:55,999
Approaching from your east.

1060
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,376
Bring us on in.

1061
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,179
Nice to have
you back, Mr. President.

1062
01:20:28,114 --> 01:20:29,991
Mr. President, stand by.

1063
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,203
And three, two, one.

1064
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,873
Good afternoon.

1065
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:41,586
It has been two weeks since
the downing of Air Force One,

1066
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,922
and the tragic loss
of so many

1067
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:46,633
trusted colleagues
and friends.

1068
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,761
In the days to come,
there will be hearings

1069
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:53,014
and investigations into
how this cowardly attack

1070
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,975
was planned
and executed.

1071
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,727
The findings
will be made public.

1072
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:01,398
Anyone found culpable
or complicit

1073
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:02,899
will face
the full brunt

1074
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:05,735
of the United States of
America's judicial system,

1075
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:09,072
and the unbearable weight
of her military might.

1076
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:13,702
I sit here
this evening, alive,

1077
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:17,831
thanks to the bravery
and courageousness

1078
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,585
of our Secret Service agents
aboard Air Force One,

1079
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:24,796
most of whom gave their lives
to ensure my protection.

1080
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:29,009
These were my friends,
my confidants,

1081
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,928
in many ways,
my family.

1082
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:35,348
Our great nation
is no stranger to tragedy.

1083
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:40,395
What is most important now
is how we respond,

1084
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,065
what we do next.

1085
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,568
We will get up off of the mat.

1086
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,070
We will live our fullest lives.

1087
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:53,742
We will adhere to our ideals
and our morals with integrity.

1088
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:57,245
That is how we will honor
those whom we have lost.

1089
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,957
That is how we will
honor the heroes

1090
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,376
who have given
their lives in service.

1091
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:07,797
We will not lash out blindly
like a wounded animal.

1092
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:10,717
We will not engage
in the performative

1093
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,095
or theatrical
to soothe our fears.

1094
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:16,932
We will not declare war
on an abstract

1095
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:19,392
to regain
the illusion of control.

1096
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:23,772
We will not repeat
the mistakes of our past.

1097
01:22:23,813 --> 01:22:27,192
We will acknowledge
the uncomfortable reality

1098
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,444
that there will be those
that wish us harm.

1099
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:33,239
Dangers will always linger in
the shadows of our vast world.

1100
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,367
Tyrants
will seek power,

1101
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:38,370
and terrorists will
attempt to intimidate.

1102
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,539
And while we will
remain vigilant,

1103
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:43,583
we must
also be sure

1104
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,919
not to seed
the grounds of despair

1105
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,630
that allow their lies
and false promises to grow

1106
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,548
in the minds
of the desperate.

1107
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,717
We will heal,

1108
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:55,887
we will grow,

1109
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:58,765
and we will move
forward together.

1110
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:01,810
May God bless you,

1111
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,730
and God bless
the United States of America.
