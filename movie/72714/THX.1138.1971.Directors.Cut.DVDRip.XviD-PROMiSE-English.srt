00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,591
Buck Rogers, now adventuring
in the amazing world of the 20th century,

in the wonderful world of the future,

5
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:39,135
A world that sees a lot of our scientific
and mechanical dreams come true,

6
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,433
You know, there's nothing supernatural
or mystic about Buck,

7
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:46,738
He's just an ordinary, normal human being
who keeps his wits about him,

8
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,677
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, nothing really,

9
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,913
I just feel that I need
something stronger,

10
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,651
If you have a problem,
don 't hesitate to ask for assistance,

Never mind,

14

Never mind,

15
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:40,815
Never mind,

16
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,647
Never mind, Never mind,

Can you feel this?

18
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,455
What is that? Nausea?

19
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,230
Are you now?

20
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,730

30
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,587
-What's wrong?
-I want you to take a visual record of this,

31
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,560
We found it in the patching cells,
We killed it,

32
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,734
Thank you for being conscientious,

33
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,095

-That's right,
-What's wrong?

48
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,793
I just bought one of these yesterday

,,,and the store doesn 't have
the other kind,

Must demand complete insertion
in the override,

56
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,849
It's getting into a critical phase,

57
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,178

This is city probe scanner,

00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,845
We 've run across
some illegal sexual activity,

68
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,714
It should be on your DTO screen now,

69

74
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:50,230
That accident over in Red Sector L
destroyed another 63 personnel,,,

75
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:55,169
,,,giving them a total
of 242 lost to our 1 95,

76
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,400
Keep up the good work
and prevent accidents,

This shift is concluded,

-Masses for the masses.

One for all. All is one.
Masses are what we are.

91
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,218
We are the masses.
But all in all, we are masses.

For the Party and for all,
masses are what we are.

Very good, Proceed,

94
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,129
Well...

95
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,128
...I slipped...

96
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,164
...on a thermal transfer this morning.

97
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,970
It's never happened before.

98
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,413
I wasn't concentrating enough.

99
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,345
Yes, I understand,

100
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,217
Things haven't been...

101
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,612
-...going well.
-Yes, fine,

102
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,349
How could I be so wrong?.

103
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,026
My mate...

104
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,792
...has been acting very strange.

105
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,430
I can't explain it.

106
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,041
-Yes,
-I haven't been feeling very well myself.

107
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:48,043
-Yes, I understand,
-I don't know, maybe it's me.

108
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,014
Yes, fine,

109
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,081
I needed some pinural last night.

110
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,955
-I feel as if something...
-Excellent,

111
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,423
...odd were happening to me.

112
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,153
-Something that...
-Yes?

113
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,460
-...I can't understand.
-Could you be more,,,

114
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,261
,,,specific?

115
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,370
The sedatives.

116
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:18,710
I'm taking etracene,
but it doesn't seem strong enough.

117
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,245
I have a hard time concentrating.

118
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,575
You are a true believer,
Blessings of the state,

119

122
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:41,226
Let us be thankful
we have an occupation to fill,

123
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,363
Work hard,

124
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,560

,,,be happy,

128
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:58,079
If it will make you happy,
just this once.

129
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,684
Now, be careful, it' s heavy.

130
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,219
THX?.

131
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,343
THX?.

132
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,331
THX?.

133
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,305
Is that you?.

134
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,262
We are sorry,
but we must deny your request,

135
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:27,929
Birthborns are not allowed
more than 5 units of enerval,

136
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,234
Substitution of enerval for etracene,,,

137
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,739
,,,may cause
a serious chemical imbalance,

138
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,842
Thank you,

139
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,559
Never before have we been
so contented, Never,

140
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,827
A dragon sounds like this when--

141
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,982
--nine units of detuned escalatories
have not, however,,,

142
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:26,089
,,,prevented virus and ordnance
from invading our centers,

143
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,587
The three recently elected representatives
from Con 9 have again resigned,,,

144
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,732
-,,,and returned to their sectors,
-You ought to eat.

145
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,095
Five felons were caught fleeing
rehabilitation center DD2,

146
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,296
All five have been undergoing treatment
for drug offenses,

147
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,538
-Where did you get this car?
-I was just issued it,

148
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:51,944
I took it for a test drive and ran straight
through a crowd at the dispersal center,

149
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,179
Oh, terrible, Terrible,

150
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,480
No, No, it was wonderful,

151
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,885
Because I didn 't hit anyone, just an 1 1 14,

152
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,322
What's this?. Why did you change it?.

153
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,894
-You've seen enough.
-Well, that's wonderful,

154
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,588
-No, it's terrible,
-You know I don't feel well.

155
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,993
-Take your sedation.
-That is terrible, just terrible,

156
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,969
No, it was wonderful, wonderful,

157
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,611
Because my hand,
it was paralyzed anyway,

158
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,973
That was very funny.

159
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:32,381
Remember, an enerval overdose
may cause a serious chemical imbalance,

160
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,639
My time is yours,

161
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,007
Go ahead,

162
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,613
What' s wrong with me?.

163
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,743
What am I to her or she to me?.
Nothing.

164
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:04,082
- Yes, fine,
-She' s an ordinary roommate.

165
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,190
I share rooms with her.

166
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,194
-Our relationship is normal, conforming.
-Excellent,

167
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,195
We share nothing...

168
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,698
...but space.

169
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,297
What is she doing to me?.

170
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,038
Yes, I understand,

171
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,336
I think I'm dying.

172
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,704
Could you be more,,,

173
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,678
,,,specific?

174
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,823
You are a true believer,

175
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,053
Blessings of the state,

176
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,425
Blessings of the masses,

177
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:53,367
Thou art a subject of the divine,
created in the image of man,,,

178
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,668
,,,by the masses, for the masses,

179
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,777
Let us be thankful we have commerce,

180
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,847
Buy more, Buy more now,

181
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,449
Buy,,,

182
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,677
,,,and be happy,

183
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,384
What's wrong?

184
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,789
What's wrong?

185
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,958
What's wrong?

186
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,901
What's wrong?

187
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,361
What's wrong?

188
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,803
What's wrong?

189
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,071
What's wrong?

190
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,903
-What's wrong?
-Never mind,

191
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,634
I was so afraid.

192
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,973
So alone.

193
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,675
I wanted to touch you...

194
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,518
...so many times.

195
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,627
I was happy.

196
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,424
Why get me involved?.

197
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,305
They know.

198
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,340
They've been watching us.

199
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,781
I can feel it.

200
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,416
No one knows.

201
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,987
They're watching us now.

202
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,285
No one can see us.

203
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,091
I can,,,

204
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,856
,,,feel it,

205
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,345
Twenty-four,

206
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,853
Twenty-three,

207
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,380
Twenty-two,

208
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,760
6442, gate five, please,

209
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,413
We've got a malfunctioning officer
in corridor 7A,

210
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,378
All right, just a minute,
Standby, scope 1,

211
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:07,414
If you go back on sedation,
you won't feel the same way about me.

212
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,980
You'll report me for drug violation.

213
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,422
I've got a slip movement to install
on my next shift.

214
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,392
I'll never make it the way I am now.

215
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,536
I wouldn't turn you in, not now.

216
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,506
-You don't--
-I know I wouldn't.

217
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,703
You can do it without etracene.

218
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,042
-You can. I know you can.
-Then what?.

219
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,317
It can't go on forever, you know it can't.

220
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,553
We could leave.

221
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,320
And live in the superstructure.

222
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,924
You only have one more shift left,
don't you?.

223
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,463
We could be gone
before the next series started.

224
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,284
It's all right.

225
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,949
-It's all right.
-Standing by,

226
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,761
What's this?.

227
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,298
I have to see SEN.

228
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,908
I've just been given a shift change.

229
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,876
-When?.
-Now.

230
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,877
-Now?.
-He wants me to come to his quarters.

231
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,448
A shift change should come
through scheduling.

232
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,676
Why should he want to see you?.

233
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,483
I don't know.

234
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,259
-Don't go.
-I have to. He's a G34.

235
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,394
You don't have to.

236
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,891
I don't trust him.
You ought to file a report.

237
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,160
No.

238
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,296
Don't make trouble.

239
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,339
It's nothing.

240
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,738
Then why did you bring it up?.

241
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,774
I didn't.

242
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,015
You asked me about the card.

243
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,351
You're going to get us
into trouble.

244
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,654
Do not push or shove at the fountain,
It's more work for the cleaning detail,

245
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,888
-Did you copy that?
-The android, the hung-over writing,

246
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,067
Is he getting that?
Is he copying me?

247
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,795
This is borough-flow submaster,
Control, have you got that code yet?

248
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,634
I read you very badly,
I'll check the message,,,,

249
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,423
-Twenty-three hunter portapods.
-lt' s you.

250
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,651
-Twenty-three hunter portapods.
-Come in, come in. Sit down.

251
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,593
You know, this is really odd.
I was just thinking about you.

252
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,463
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning...

253
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,299
...and it's been going on all day.

254
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,101
The roommate was destroyed, you know.

255
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,939
Terrible inconvenience.

256
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:29,010
Have to try to see things in perspective,
do what you can...

257
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,519
...to make things...

258
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,659
...fit.

259
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,624
I can accept things up to a point.

260
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,962
But if you get a chance...

261
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,734
...to make...

262
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,699
...adjustments...

263
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,501
...you're very foolish to pass them up.

264
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,738
Where is LUH?.

265
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,972
-What?.
-Your card, please.

266
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,116
Thank you.

267
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:10,660
This monitor is to be used for emergencies
or special requests only,

268
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,127
All routine information
can easily be obtained,,,

269
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:17,699
,,,through the bulletin panels
installed at--

270
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,529
Why did you have LUH come here?.

271
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,032
Why are you so concerned?.

272
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,268
What's going on?.

273
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,148
I want you for my roommate.

274
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,845
We'll be very good for one another.

275
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,758
I don't understand. Living--

276
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,428
Living selection is computed.

277
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,465
I know what you're thinking.

278
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,032
Program-shifting isn't
that major a crime, is it?.

279
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,903
You're in violation.

280
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,477
Don't say that.

281
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,375
What have you done to LUH?.
She was here.

282
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,508
We...

283
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,417
...had a long talk.

284
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:16,460
And she agreed that it would be better
for both of you to switch.

285
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:22,132
She seemed to think that you weren't
accurately mated with her in the first place.

286
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,031
I'll never have another mate like ONA.

287
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,339
You rate very high in sanitation.
I've checked.

288
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,473
I don't feel well.

289
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,415
We'll be happy.

290
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,295
Combined with the economic advantages
of the mating structure,,,

291
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,664
,,,it far surpasses any disadvantages
in increased perversions,

292
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,168
A final trans--

293
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:05,468
An infinite translated mathematics
of tolerance and charity,,,

294
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:11,582
,,,among artificial memory devices
is ultimately binary,

295
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,910
Stimulating rhetoric,

296
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,515
LUH?.

297
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,751
Absolute,

298
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,285
The theater of noise is proof
of our potential,

299
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,198
The circulation of prototypes,

300
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:32,392
The golden talisman underfoot
is phenomenon approaching,

301
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,540
And in the history of now,,,

302
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,676
,,,all ethos are designed,

303
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,080
Why are you here?.
You ' re not cleared for this area.

304
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,725
You know I have a way with computers.
I can program myself for any area, almost.

305
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,393
I'll report you.

306
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,154
Listen, no need to be distressed with me.

307
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,891
-Get out of here, leave me alone.
-I've taken care of LUH.

308
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,729
I programmed her to area 5450.

309
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,599
The transfer should come through
by the next series.

310
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,275
You're gonna need a new roommate.

311
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,659
Performance perfect
is perfect performance,

312
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,805
Your radiation rate is five--

313
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,913
1 1 38, retract.

314
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,878
1 1 38, retract,

315
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:01,081
Something is touching
the TTO integrated logic modules,

316
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,224
Switch tools,

317
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,459
1 1 38, what's wrong?
Would you like a stronger pill?

318
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,267
1 1 38, you're getting talmod contact,

319
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,768

This is critical,

324
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,415
Okay, you can start your descent,
That's it,

325
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,284
Slow down just a little bit,
You're overriding, 7,

326
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,618
Okay, hold it, 1 1 38,

the minute you first detected it,

In any mindlock situation that is
already put to character, try and relieve it,

Everything will be all right.

You are in my hands.

Reject. Reject.

375
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,609
Inefficient, unwarranted destruction.

376
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,679
-Must be saved--
-He's allowed erotics to exist--

-lnane. What is the prosecution doing?.
-But there can be no doubt--

378
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,621
-Records show he is of clinic origin.
-Remotely subject to alteration.

379
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,316
If society is to free itself
of these deviants--

380
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,463
-This is not a race issue.
-He must be destroyed.

381
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,258
We must not continue
to consume these erotics.

382
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,765
We must exterminate the source of sin.

383
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,235
Economics must not dictate situations
which are obviously religious.

384
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,809
Masses won.
Defendant used, not destroyed.

385
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,309
Case rest.

Are you now?.

391
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,780
Or have you ever been?.

392
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,395
1 642, try 61 2.

393
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,758
He seems to have an 81 8.

394
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,866
Can you feel this?.

395
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,028
481 4...

396
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,434
...avoid the 71 4 and the 2336.

397
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,130
All right.

398
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,906
3334, that's right.

399
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,716
Concentrate on the tri-1 4 area.

400
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,415
Move slowly.

401
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,724
6341 0. Wait for 32.

402
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,362
9.

403
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,463
3437.

404
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,072
Now the 5552.

405
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,969
The 41 05.

406
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:07,015
Above the 521. The 1 22.

407
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,616
Skip the 1 1 1 4.

408
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,186
-What do you say, 56?.
-The 321.

409
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,984
And 21.

410
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,319
Under the 69.

411
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,124
That's enough.

412
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,084
Can I borrow one of your etracenes?.

413
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,355
Sure.

414
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:05,353
-I think that the lesson'll go a lot better--
-Let's write this up. You said 45 on the--

415
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,895
All right. Should we zoom
this a little here?.

416
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,066
Here, I'll just zoom it.

417
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,757
Hey, doesn't it zoom like--?.

418
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,097
Now, what have you been
checked out on over at level 387?.

419
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,400
Well, at 387, our system
was never completed. We'd use--

420
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,737
So you haven't any experience
with the Mark 8 board?. Never--

421
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,937
No, but with the Mark 7,
you had the same--

422
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,879
You could just open them up as if--
Open all four up.

423
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,349
Yeah. You ought to be careful
about the....

424
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,688
You got any polarity here
on the mobile travel?. Look.

425
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,795
-What--?.
-I just punched up one and I'm opening--

426
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,695
--imagine that that has something to do
with the results the 378 was getting.

427
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,505
That's it. Okay, now watch
that reading. And as it--

428
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,982
-Watch the needle on 5, now. Watch--
-This-- This knob is loose.

429
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,882
Wait, which switch gets it out?.

430
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,819
-Master at the bottom.
-Okay, there we are.

431
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:13,019
What is the real dope
on the cortex bond problem, anyway?.

432
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,754
Oh, you find yourself with--

433
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,470
-Don't let it get above 4.8.
-Look at this.

434
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,164
-Little monkey.
-I cut myself.

435
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,875
What if you put a dual display on it
and I punch two up?.

436
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:38,748
Yes, you can see two at once. When you see
three-- Punch a third, you'll see the numbers.

437
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:43,120
Yeah. So it's best to go back to two.
And really, to get an accurate reading....

438
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,830
-I don't see any dissolution here.
-Well, you haven't--

439
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,163
Don't let it get above 4.7.

440
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,866
Here, I'll bring these back down
a little bit.

441
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:01,033
-Yeah, I seem to be overloading it.
-Well, you should put-- lnstead of--

442
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:10,710
-There it is, about 4.6 now. Is that all right?.
-Yes, but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

443
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,548
Oh, yeah?.

444
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,160
Are you all right?.

445
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,973
What did they do to you?.

446
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,743
What?. What?.

447
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,044
I'm going to have a child.

448
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,124
Hold me.

449
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,559
Hold me.

450
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:26,686
-Come on, stand up.
-We are only here to help you.

451
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,948
-You have nothing--
-Watch it.

452
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,525
Come on, now.
We don't wanna hurt you.

453
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,424
Let go.

454
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,491
We won't harm you.

455
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,294
We only want to help you.

456
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,546
3927, could you get him
from where you are?.

457
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,140
THX 1 1 38.

458
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,789
Hi.

459
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,173
I know you turned me in.

460
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,748
I'm doing quite well here anyway.

461
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,822
I'm setting some things up...

462
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,518
...but it isn't easy.

463
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:17,063
A very difficult balance, you know?.

464
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,867
Listen. Now, let's get something straight
right from the start.

465
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:26,167
It's gonna take you some time
to see my overall plan.

466
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,834
So until then, stay out of things
you don't understand, right?.

467
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,613
You're gonna be making things
more difficult for me.

468
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,917
It's the least you can do.

469
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,658
What's wrong with you?.

470
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,226
-Don't be like that.
-It's all right.

471
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,826
You're safe now.

472
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,645
When posterity judges our actions here...

473
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,251
...it will perhaps see us
not as unwilling prisoners...

474
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,547
...but as men who,
for whatever reason...

475
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:17,659
...preferred to remain as non-contributing
individuals on the edge of society.

476
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:21,092
-We must not let this happen.
-Countless diversions.

477
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,199
-Gentlemen, the choice is there.
-Reciting where we are.

478
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,494
-Arguing about leaving.
-Make no mistake.

479
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,570
-Predicting the future. Ridiculous.
-We must choose a leader...

480
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,265
-What about keeping things livable here?.
-...to unite us.

481
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,971
-LUH 9998.
-LUH?.

482
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,542
What happened?. Who's gone?.

483
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,448
-JOT.
-My friend, your point of view....

484
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,683
Yes, CAM, that's it.

485
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,727
Your point is well taken, CAM...

486
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,459
...but it lacks the balance that a broader
and deeper range of experience can lend it.

487
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,770
When I first arrived here,
I saw things as perhaps you do now.

488
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,635
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.

489
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:10,578
I longed to thrash out, to tear down,
to destroy and annihilate...

490
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,979
...to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.

491
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,518
Being basically levelheaded, however...

492
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:22,715
...I realized that my first goal
should be to study this place...

493
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,362
...where what seemed
blind circumstance had placed me.

494
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,827
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...

495
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:34,197
...and bank those flames
with earnest inquiry and honest observation.

496
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,329
"Mumblings."

497
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,737
"Mumblings," you hear?. Know how
many times we've listened to that speech?.

498
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:45,574
Do you know how many times
we've had to listen to that speech?.

499
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,651
Thinks we're as blind as him.
Know what you are?.

500
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,979
You make me sick.
If we thought like you--

501
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:54,715
You know what I want?.
I want ideas. I want one idea.

502
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:58,520
One idea could get us out of here!

503
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:01,420
We'll just have to be sure
it's the right idea.

504
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:05,362
We'll find it. We'll know it when we see it.
I'll know it when I see it!

505
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:09,665
Clear and straightforward
and plain as the nose on your face.

506
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:15,577
Talked to oneself over....

507
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:19,010
--believed he was going
to a place where he'd be happy.

508
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:24,677
And in so believing, he created
a veritable paradise for himself right here.

509
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:30,556
Unfortunately, not all of us can have
the positive conviction of LOO.

510
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:35,789
But, thankfully, not all of us are burdened
with the ominous forebodings of SEN.

511
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,626
I, myself--

512
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,906
Now, that's what I mean
by the wrong idea.

513
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,636
Look, I'm not going to try
to prove the usefulness of history.

514
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:53,509
It is genuinely too obvious
to need proof.

515
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,089
I want to help you.

516
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:08,595
You can help me.

517
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,565
Here.

518
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,999
Take a biscuit.

519
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,968
You understand, we're all in this together.

520
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,638
You want to leave. You're not like them.

521
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,244
I'll see to it
that we all get out of here.

522
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,743
Take it easy! Look at them.
It's pathetic. It's pitiful.

523
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:31,182
They've even begun to go into
my corner and look for things.

524
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,650
My things.

525
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,618
You're with me.

526
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,349
I know.

527
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,661
I have a contract.

528
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,092
All it says is:

529
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,460
"You're with me."

530
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,662
We're all in this together.

531
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,136
We must convince the others.

532
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,004
Later, then.

533
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:14,061
We need a new unity.

534
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,199
And not a unity
which discourages dissent.

535
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:21,765
We need dissent,
but we need a creative dissent.

536
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,404
Our voices are not raised
in any harmonious chorus...

537
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:31,241
...but our differences are differences
of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.

538
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:37,745
-Tomorrow, as we--
-Nondescript 6431 399.

539
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,926
-What is it?.
-A shell dweller.

540
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,619
They live in the outer shell. Quite unique.

541
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,994
There have been two here before,
and they smell.

542
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,032
What do you know?.

543
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,569
Come here, my friend.

544
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,606
Let me touch you.

545
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:26,966
What'd he just do?.

546
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:30,032
What's wrong, huh?.

547
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,968
Your lunch is dirty. What a waste.

548
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,509
Here, we can save some of it.

549
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,844
It's all right.

550
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,184
Everything's fine.

551
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,276
What?.

552
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,510
Well, if you didn't want it,
why'd you take it?.

553
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,981
I thought this was all settled.

554
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,719
-Where you going?.
-I'm leaving.

555
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,398
Leaving?. Leaving what?.
You can't leave.

556
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,193
You can't go. Hey, wait.

557
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,094
Oh, I know, the smell. Yeah, it's terrible.

558
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,435
It's a little bit....

559
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,805
Hey, you can't--
You can't leave without....

560
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,371
Just a minute.

561
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,880
Wait. Just wait there a minute.

562
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,746
After long deliberation,
I have decided to go out...

563
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,184
...and personally examine the barrier...

564
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,291
...to learn firsthand
what difficulties are involved...

565
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:00,020
...and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk...

566
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,030
...but moments such as these require
that a choice be made and action taken...

567
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,930
...regardless of the danger.
We'll be back soon...

568
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,039
...but we'll be gone long enough to form
an accurate and functional escape.

569
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:15,337
And I shall have an honest idea
how best to organize us into a working unit.

570
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:19,208
-The new alignment.
-lncredible.

571
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,717
Wait. Wait. Hey, wait for me.

572
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:26,753
Just the thing to put them on their feet.
Show them who the leaders are.

573
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,824
When we get back, they'll be right there,
right in the palm of my hand.

574
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,058
There's no question.
Even old PTO would be with us...

575
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,323
...if he'd still been advised.

576
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:50,970
How far before they can't
see us anymore, huh?.

577
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,877
Maybe we better sit down right here.

578
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,747
Hey, rest for a while.

579
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,583
I can't....

580
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,687
I can't see them anymore.

581
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,193
LUH.

582
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,829
You're going after LUH, aren't you?.

583
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,965
Why, it's ridiculous.

584
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,798
Going after....

585
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:18,706
Oh, wait, I knew there was something
I had to tell you.

586
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,706
LUH, you know, the other--?.
The new LUH?.

587
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:26,905
He told me he'd seen her.
He saw her just before he came out here.

588
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,551
-She's gonna be coming out here.
-How was she?.

589
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,245
Oh, very well. Very good health.
Just exactly the way--

590
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,948
-You're lying.
-No, I am not.

591
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,457
The air's getting thinner.

592
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:48,327
Or pressure's getting greater.

593
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,465
It's the pressure.

594
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,771
How do you feel?.

595
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,204
Shouldn't be this far.

596
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,043
There's no air.

597
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,193
I haven't got the time.
You can stay here if you like.

598
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,401
I'll come with you.

599
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,108
What?.

600
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,547
Look.

601
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,080
What?.

602
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,580
That's a man.

603
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,988
It's a man. He's waving.
He's waving to us.

604
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,313
Hi.

605
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,046
Hi.

606
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,676
Hello.

607
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,755
Where'd you guys come from?.

608
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,954
Oh, well, it doesn't make any difference.
Is that food?.

609
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,654
I'm starving. Do you mind?.

610
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,299
How did you get here?.

611
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,302
I mean, I was lost.

612
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,498
You're not lost now?.

613
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,543
Know the way out?.

614
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,043
-That's the way out.
-That's the way we came.

615
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,615
Yeah, but maybe you were traveling
in circles. That's the way out.

616
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,012
How do you know?.

617
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,709
Well, look.

618
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:47,985
Look more closely. You see?.

619
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,186
Come on.

620
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:51,951
Oh, yeah.

621
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,983
Nothing stopped us.

622
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,284
Come on.

623
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,485
Here's a doorway.

624
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,819
Keep causeways clean,

625
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,597
Save time, Save lives,

626
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,934
Keep causeways clean,

627
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,870
Save time, save lives,

628
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,810
Keep causeways clean,

629
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,270

00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,987
Save time, save lives,

632
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,922
Keep causeways clean,

633
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,366
Save time, save lives,

634
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,810
-Hello, 1 2,
-Synapse module, this is security B,

635
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,239
Read me, synapse module?

636
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,573
Research into relay system

637

--intercerebral process reported earlier,

638
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,523
How shall the new environment
be programmed?.

639
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,719
It all happened so slowly that...

640
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,526
...most men failed to realize
that anything had happened at all.

641
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,866
I wonder what happened to SEN.

642
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,701
We'll never make it through
that main way.

643
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,575
-Who are you?.
-I'm a hologram.

644
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:54,383
I'm not real. You know,
the fantasy bureau...

645
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,178
...electrically-generated realities
and all that.

646
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,153
I was stuck in the same circuit
for too long.

647
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,884
The arm and leg routine,
did you see that one?.

648
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,094
I always wanted to be part
of the real world.

649
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,734
So I left.

650
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,103
Hey, look.

651
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,646
You are engaged
in an unauthorized procedure,

652
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,680
Remain where you are, This--

653
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:31,686
We have a U65 on a K8.

658
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:44,880
This is 91 021 on case 91 8.
We are going to need assistance.

659
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:47,078
This is an electronic-restricted area.

660
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:50,348
It would be nice to have
three additional officers.

661
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,961
-Have you seen them?.
-No. They must be somewhere in group 9.

662
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,188
Operation 5271.

663
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:15,135
Budget Control, we'd like a cost analysis
on the THX 1 1 38 account,

664
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,845
Include all interest
and inflation percentages,

665
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:22,245
Expenditures are 649 and rising,

666
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:35,322
-What was that?.
-Must be an expressway.

667
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:41,731
This is Budget Control, The expenditure
ceiling on the THX case is 14,000 credits,

668
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:46,666
Remember, thrifty thinkers
are always under budget,

669
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,041
Would you like part of this?.
It's not very much.

670
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:06,651
Did you know all the insides are gone
from all these people?.

671
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,203
Halt.

672
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,723
Economics make it necessary
to terminate any operation,,,

673

of its primary budget,

Expenditures are 1 000 and rising,

675
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,929
Things don ' t seem to make sense.

676
01:07:57,139 --> 01:08:00,506
Sometimes I see things get left out...

677
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,435
...and they don ' t fit.

678
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,944
People don't seem to see them.

679
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,077
Or they don't know what to do.

680
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,847
Sometimes l--

681
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,954
Sometimes little....

682
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:18,418
A little adjustment...

683
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,027
...can make all the difference.

684
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:25,229
I wanna do the right thing.

685
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,536
I wanna go back.

686
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,437
I.... I....

687
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:33,938
I can-- I can start again.

688
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,339
I can change.

689
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,842
I can-- I can help.

690
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,521
I just need a....

691
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,019
Need to rest up for a little while.

692
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,590
This is no place for prayer.

693
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,860
If you want to speak to OMM,
you must go to a unichapel, you know that.

694
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,061
-Yeah.
-What?.

695
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,537
-Are you in any trouble?.
-No. I'm okay. I'm going now.

696
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:10,769
What's your number and your prefix?.
I'm gonna see this gets into your report.

697
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,470
No, I'm leaving now.

698
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:15,673
I'm sorry, I have to report all intruders.

699
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,945
-Where's your identification badge?.
-I lost it.

700
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,318
You're in violation.
I'll have to report you to the authorities.

701
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,959
-No, it's not my time.
-Please, just--

702
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,146
Trapped.

703
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,554
Trapped.

704
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:13,468
Looks like the only way out
is the way we came in.

705
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,539
Say, do you have any more
of that food?. I'm hungry.

706
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,013
She's not there.

707
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,778
Who are you looking for?.

708
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:32,090
Can you hear me?. Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.

709
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,854
The door seems to be jammed.

710
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,026
Please check the lock on your side.

711
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:43,634
Everything will be all right,
We are here to help you,

712
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:46,030
Stay calm,

713
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:49,473
We are not going to harm you,

714
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,441

715
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:58,409
Well, unless that computer
has made a mistake...

716
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,118
...that' s your roommate.

717
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,953
No. No, you ' re wrong.

718
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,496
I hope that auxiliary load holds.

719
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:15,226
I'm almost through
to the upper positive plates.

720
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,669
Upper positive plates?.

721
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,971
Maybe you are right. Maybe there's
something wrong with the computer.

722
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,639
I don't know. It's a strange life.

723
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,785
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers
and all those things.

724
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:33,750
I guess I'll never understand
any of that stuff.

725
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,156
Guess maybe holograms
are not supposed to.
