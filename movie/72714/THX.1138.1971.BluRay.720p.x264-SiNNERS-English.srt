1
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:23,397
Buck Rogers in the 20th century!

2
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,777
Buck Rogers, now adventuring in the
amazing world of the 20th century.

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,947
By turning the dial
to project us ahead in time...

4
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:36,285
...we're able to be with Buck and friends
in the wonderful world of the future.

5
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,289
A world that sees a lot of our scientific
and mechanical dreams come true.

6
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,625
You know, there's nothing supernatural
or mystic about Buck.

7
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,004
He's just an ordinary, normal human
being who keeps his wits about him.

8
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,896
What's wrong?
Nothing really.

9
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,107
I just feel that I need something stronger.

10
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,819
If you have a problem,
don't hesitate to ask for assistance.

11
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,947
Yes, thank you, I'll be all right.
Call 348-FUN...

12
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,791
What's wrong?

13
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,627
Never mind.

14
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,590
Never mind.

15
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,970
Never mind.

16
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,805
Never mind.
Never mind.

17
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,311
Can you feel this?

18
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,647
What is that?
Nausea?

19
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,440
Are you now?

20
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,943
Or have you ever been?

21
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,445
Move slowly.

22
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,178
Hello, is somebody else there?

23
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,514
THX, this is inner control.

24
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,353
You're off .017 to the right.
Correct it, please.

25
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,856
Make the correction, THX.

26
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:40,195
All right. Just back off, THX 1138.
Back off for a second.

27
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,574
Okay, hold it there, 1138.
Hold. Hold. Hold...

28
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,661
What's wrong?
I need something stronger.

29
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,705
Take four red capsules.

30
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,458
In 10 minutes, take two more.
Help is on the way.

31
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,754
What's wrong?
Take a visual record of this.

32
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,716
We found it in the patching cells.
We killed it.

33
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,884
Thank you for being conscientious.

34
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,262
A visual record is being taken...

35
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,932
...and filed with the Department
of Biological Flow. You have...

36
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,102
...now out of service
in one section of the Filoz era...

37
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,064
...shall, in any consequence
of any law or regulation...

38
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,191
...be discharged from such service...

39
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:23,488
...but shall be delivered up on claim of the
party to whom such service may be due.

40
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:33,415
For greater efficiency,
consumption is being standardized.

41
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,875
We are sorry.

42
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:39,421
All right, just back off, THX 1138.
Back off for a second.

43
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,924
All right,
make the appropriate correction.

44
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,052
That's it.

45
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:52,434
Check the grid line.
Should be 1239, 1239.

46
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,104
All right, watch it.
You're gonna override again. Bring it down.

47
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,773
You're right next to it.

48
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,441
Right.
What's wrong?

49
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,945
I bought one of these yesterday
and it doesn't fit my consumer...

50
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,573
...and the store doesn't have
the other kind.

51
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,910
For more enjoyment
and greater efficiency...

52
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,954
...consumption is being standardized.

53
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,456
- We are sorry.
- This is...

54
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,793
Attention all stations,
I have a temporary blockage...

55
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,087
...affecting a Red Section module.

56
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,298
Watch the insertion in the override.
It's getting into a critical phase.

57
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,345
What's wrong?
Comperson and penderal...

58
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,598
What's wrong, Papa?
...compatible within group 3A.

59
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,643
If you feel
you are not properly sedated...

60
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:39,272
...call 348-844 immediately.

61
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,483
Failure to do so may result...

62
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,196
...in prosecution
for criminal drug evasion.

63
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,156
A. Excursions...

64
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,535
For more enjoyment
and greater efficiency...

65
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,664
...consumption is being standardized.
We are sorry...

66
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,666
This is city probe scanner.

67
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,002
We've run across
some illegal sexual activity.

68
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,880
It should be on your DTO screen now.

69
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,524
There has been an accident
in Red Sector L14.

70
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:27,737
Do not abandon your post.
There is no danger of radiation leakage.

71
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:32,868
Repeat, there has been
an accident in Red Sector L14.

72
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:38,707
Do not abandon your post.
There is no danger of radiation leakage.

73
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,711
6241, is everything all right down there?

74
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,717
That accident over in Red Sector L...

75
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,386
...destroyed another 63 personnel...

76
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:56,349
...giving them a total
of 242 lost to our 195.

77
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,561
Keep up the good work
and prevent accidents.

78
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,563
This shift is concluded.

79
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,361
A libido leveler has been mislaid...

80
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,572
...near the pulse-buffering gate.

81
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,407
If you have accidentally...

82
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:26,087
Today, blue dendrites are only 47 credits.
Buy now.

83
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,723
Visual binaries now can previse
and improve your reading.

84
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:52,906
Your consumer has a factor of 98.

85
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,705
Stay calm.

86
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,017
This elevator
has been removed from service.

87
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,772
Please use the next elevator
on your right.

88
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,111
This elevator has been removed
from service.

89
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,321
Please use the next elevator...

90
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,203
My time is yours.

91
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,205
- Masses for the masses.
- Go ahead.

92
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,292
One for all. All is one.
Masses are what we are.

93
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,378
We are the masses.
But all in all, we are masses.

94
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,172
For the Party and for all,
masses are what we are.

95
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,676
Very good.
Proceed.

96
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,307
Well...

97
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,311
...I slipped...

98
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,355
...on a thermal transfer this morning.

99
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,150
It's never happened before.

100
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,573
I wasn't concentrating enough.

101
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,534
Yes, I understand.

102
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,370
Things haven't been...

103
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,832
- ...going well.
- Yes, fine.

104
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,543
How could I be so wrong?

105
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,216
My mate...

106
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,012
...has been acting very strange.

107
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,598
I can't explain it.

108
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,226
- Yes.
- I haven't been feeling very well myself.

109
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,230
- Yes, I understand.
- I don't know, maybe it's me.

110
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,193
Yes, fine.

111
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,237
I needed some pinural last night.

112
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,117
- I feel as if something...
- Excellent.

113
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,578
...odd were happening to me.

114
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,373
- Something that...
- Yes?

115
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,627
- ...I can't understand.
- Could you be more...

116
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,420
...specific?

117
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,547
The sedatives.

118
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,886
I'm taking etracene,
but it doesn't seem strong enough.

119
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,430
I have a hard time concentrating.

120
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,767
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.

121
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,436
- Please, forgive me.
- Blessings of the masses.

122
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:33,650
Thou art a subject of the divine,
created in the image of man...

123
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,112
...by the masses, for the masses.

124
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,409
Let us be thankful
we have an occupation to fill.

125
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,577
Work hard.

126
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,746
Increase production.

127
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,083
Prevent accidents.

128
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,960
And...

129
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,129
...be happy.

130
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:59,259
If it will make you happy, just this once.

131
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,803
Now, be careful, it's heavy.

132
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,439
THX?

133
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,504
THX?

134
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,525
THX?

135
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,486
Is that you?

136
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,426
We are sorry,
but we must deny your request.

137
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:29,098
Birthborns are not allowed
more than 5 units of enerval.

138
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,393
Substitution of enerval for etracene...

139
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,898
...may cause
a serious chemical imbalance.

140
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,025
Thank you.

141
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,736
Never before have we been so contented.
Never.

142
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,992
A dragon sounds like this when...

143
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,171
...nine units of detuned escalatories
have not, however...

144
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,300
...prevented virus and ordnance
from invading our centers.

145
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,805
The three recently elected representatives
from Con 9 have again resigned...

146
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,892
- ...and returned to their sectors.
- You ought to eat.

147
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,228
Five felons were caught fleeing
rehabilitation center DD2.

148
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,398
All five have been undergoing treatment
for drug offenses.

149
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,695
- Where did you get this car?
- I was just issued it.

150
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:52,367
I took it for a test drive and ran straight
through a crowd at the dispersal center.

151
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,329
Terrible.
Terrible.

152
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,581
No.
No, it was wonderful.

153
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,042
Because I didn't hit anyone, just an 1114.

154
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,419
What's this?
Why did you change it?

155
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,047
- You've seen enough.
- That's wonderful.

156
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,758
- It's terrible.
- You know I don't feel well.

157
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:14,180
- Take your sedation.
- That is just terrible.

158
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,183
No, it was wonderful, wonderful.

159
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,770
Because my hand, it was paralyzed anyway.

160
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,189
That was very funny.

161
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,405
An enerval overdose...

162
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,574
...may cause
a serious chemical imbalance.

163
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,801
My time is yours.

164
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,220
Go ahead.

165
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,764
What's wrong with me?

166
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,935
What am I to her or she to me?
Nothing.

167
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:05,273
- Yes, fine.
- She's an ordinary roommate.

168
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,402
I share rooms with her.

169
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,406
- Our relationship is normal, conforming.
- Excellent.

170
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,408
We share nothing...

171
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,910
...but space.

172
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,455
What is she doing to me?

173
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,251
Yes, I understand.

174
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,503
I think I'm dying.

175
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,923
Could you be more...

176
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,842
...specific?

177
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,978
You are a true believer.

178
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,272
Blessings of the state.

179
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,608
Blessings of the masses.

180
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,530
Thou art a subject of the divine,
created in the image of man...

181
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,826
...by the masses, for the masses.

182
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,954
Let us be thankful we have commerce.

183
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:06,000
Buy more.
Buy more now.

184
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,627
Buy...

185
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,837
...and be happy.

186
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,553
What's wrong?

187
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,971
What's wrong?

188
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,140
What's wrong?

189
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,060
What's wrong?

190
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,521
What's wrong?

191
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,981
What's wrong?

192
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,234
What's wrong?

193
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,070
- What's wrong?
- Never mind.

194
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,836
I was so afraid.

195
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,134
So alone.

196
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,895
I wanted to touch you...

197
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,733
...so many times.

198
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,780
I was happy.

199
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,617
Why get me involved?

200
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,493
They know.

201
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,498
They've been watching us.

202
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,959
I can feel it.

203
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,629
No one knows.

204
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,174
They're watching us now.

205
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,470
No one can see us.

206
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,256
I can...

207
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,049
...feel it.

208
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,527
Twenty-four.

209
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,031
Twenty-three.

210
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,574
Twenty-two.

211
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,918
6442, gate five, please.

212
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,598
We've got a malfunctioning
officer in corridor 7A.

213
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,559
All right, just a minute.
Standby, scope 1.

214
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,594
If you go back on sedation,
you won't feel the same way about me.

215
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,141
You'll report me for drug violation.

216
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,604
I've got a slip movement to install
on my next shift.

217
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,608
I'll never make it the way I am now.

218
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,701
I wouldn't turn you in, not now.

219
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,662
- You don't...
- I know I wouldn't.

220
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,872
You can do it without etracene.

221
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,209
- You can. I know you can.
- Then what?

222
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,504
It can't go on forever, you know it can't.

223
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,715
We could leave.

224
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,510
And live in the superstructure.

225
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,139
You only have one more shift left,
don't you?

226
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,644
We could be gone
before the next series started.

227
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,497
It's all right.

228
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,208
It's all right.

229
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,627
Standing by.

230
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,929
What's this?

231
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,516
I have to see SEN.

232
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,060
I've just been given a shift change.

233
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,062
- When?
- Now.

234
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,065
- Now?
- He wants me to come to his quarters.

235
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,610
A shift change should come
through scheduling.

236
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,862
Why should he want to see you?

237
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,698
I don't know.

238
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,410
- Don't go.
- I have to. He's a G34.

239
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,579
You don't have to.

240
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,085
I don't trust him.
You ought to file a report.

241
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,379
No.

242
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,466
Don't make trouble.

243
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,551
It's nothing.

244
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,929
Then why did you bring it up?

245
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,931
I didn't.

246
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,226
You asked me about the card.

247
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,566
You're going to get us into trouble.

248
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,818
Do not push at the fountain.

249
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,820
It's more work for the cleaning detail.

250
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,074
Did you copy that?
The hung-over writing.

251
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,243
Is he getting that?
Is he copying me?

252
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,328
This is borough-flow submaster.

253
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,955
Control, have you got that code?

254
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,792
I read you very badly.
I'll check the message...

255
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,600
...hunter portapods.
It's you.

256
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,812
Twenty-three hunter portapods.
Come in. Sit down.

257
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,774
You know, this is really odd.
I was just thinking about you.

258
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:13,654
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning...

259
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,490
...and it's been going on all day.

260
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,286
The roommate was destroyed, you know.

261
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,122
Terrible inconvenience.

262
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:30,170
Have to try to see things in perspective,
do what you can...

263
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,674
...to make things...

264
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,844
...fit.

265
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,805
I can accept things up to a point.

266
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,141
But if you get a chance...

267
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,893
...to make...

268
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,855
...adjustments...

269
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,692
...you're very foolish to pass them up.

270
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,904
Where is LUH?

271
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,158
- What?
- Your card, please.

272
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,327
Thank you.

273
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,043
This monitor is to be used...

274
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,837
...for emergencies
or special requests only.

275
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,341
All routine information
can easily be obtained...

276
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,843
...through the bulletin panels
installed at...

277
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,723
Why did you have LUH come here?

278
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,225
Why are you so concerned?

279
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,436
What's going on?

280
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,360
I want you for my roommate.

281
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,032
We'll be very good for one another.

282
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,910
I don't understand.
Living...

283
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,579
Living selection is computed.

284
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,625
I know what you're thinking.

285
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,212
Program-shifting isn't
that major a crime, is it?

286
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,092
You're in violation.

287
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,636
Don't say that.

288
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,557
What have you done to LUH?
She was here.

289
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,727
We...

290
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,606
...had a long talk.

291
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,611
And she agreed that it would be better
for both of you to switch.

292
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,906
She seemed to think that
you weren't accurately mated...

293
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,283
...with her in the first place.

294
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:28,247
I'll never have another mate like ONA.

295
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,502
You rate very high in sanitation.
I've checked.

296
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,633
I don't feel well.

297
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,595
We'll be happy.

298
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,483
With the economic advantages
of the mating structure...

299
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,821
...it far surpasses any disadvantages
in increased perversions.

300
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,322
A final trans...

301
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,660
An infinite translated mathematics
of tolerance and charity...

302
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:12,791
...among artificial memory devices
is ultimately binary.

303
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,169
Stimulating rhetoric.

304
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,672
LUH?

305
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,966
Absolute.

306
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,470
The theater of noise is proof
of our potential.

307
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,348
The circulation of prototypes.

308
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:33,562
The golden talisman underfoot
is phenomenon approaching.

309
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,691
And in the history of now...

310
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,861
...all ethos are designed.

311
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,246
Why are you here?
You're not cleared for this area.

312
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,876
You know I have a way with computers.
I can program myself for any area, almost.

313
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,544
I'll report you.

314
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,339
Listen, no need to be distressed with me.

315
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,051
- Get out of here, leave me alone.
- I've taken care of LUH.

316
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,887
I programmed her to area 5450.

317
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,765
The transfer should come through
by the next series.

318
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,434
You're gonna need a new roommate.

319
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:29,868
Performance perfect is perfect performance.

320
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,016
Your radiation rate is five...

321
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,102
1138, retract.

322
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,063
1138, retract.

323
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:02,276
Something is touching
the TTO integrated logic modules.

324
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,403
Switch tools.

325
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,615
1138, what's wrong?
Would you like a stronger pill?

326
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,453
1138, you're getting talmod contact.

327
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,956
Retract at 220.

328
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,625
Vector 079.

329
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:24,464
We're making contact at .003.

330
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,134
Don't override here.
This is critical.

331
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,596
Okay, you can start your descent.
That's it.

332
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,474
Slow down just a little bit.
You're overriding .7.

333
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,810
Okay, hold it, 1138.

334
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,148
THX, do you read me?
THX?

335
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,150
The radiation rate...

336
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,027
...is nine.

337
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:49,615
THX, you're entering a critical phase.

338
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,451
All right, contact.
That's it.

339
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,580
Respiratory count: 347, or plus 7.

340
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,499
Adrenal off .74.

341
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:04,463
We are receiving an extreme respiratory
count from a magnum manipulator...

342
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,966
...in operating cell 94107.

343
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,845
- Erratic visual behavior.
- Transfer control information.

344
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:16,683
Current brain wave confirmation on 1138:
adrenal off .74.

345
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,602
Analyze: severe.

346
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,856
An explanation for blocking,
so allow me to make correction.

347
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,360
You are entering a red phase, THX.

348
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,154
1138 suffering severe sedation depletion...

349
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,073
...which requires mindlock and arrest.

350
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,496
1138 filed a violation report on
SEN 5241 immediately prior to...

351
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:42,084
Request mindlock for operating cell 94107.

352
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:46,046
Subject: 1138.
Prefix: THX.

353
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,175
Mindlock restricted.
Do not mindlock cell 9410...

354
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,719
Priority shift.
Repeat, priority...

355
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,681
Mindlock pending.

356
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,394
Priority shift.
Cut the mindlock. Hold all...

357
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,166
Emergency in cell 94107.

358
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,092
Evacuate all.
Secure all atomic mass.

359
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,928
Situation white.
Repeat...

360
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,931
...situation white.
Will somebody cut the mindlock?

361
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,560
Clear.
Clear.

362
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:47,232
Who permitted a mindlock priority
in magnum cell 94107?

363
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,127
Release mindlock.

364
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,423
Relapse to command monitor.
Release mindlock.

365
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,474
6241, is everything all right down there?
Did we ignore it?

366
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,978
WO Control center 626
holds no responsibility...

367
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,647
...for error in mindlock.

368
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,610
Control center's
transreceiver, this is grid control.

369
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,779
The power run incorporating
an H020 claim...

370
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,864
...which blocked communication
in the...

371
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,451
You should've reported
that the minute you first detected it.

372
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,453
In any mindlock situation...

373
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,289
...that is already put to character,
try and relieve it.

374
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,680
Everything will be all right.

375
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,016
You are in my hands.

376
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,894
I am here to protect you.

377
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,688
You have nowhere to go.

378
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,483
You have nowhere to go.

379
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:29,709
1138 THX is charged with violation
appendix 445 to 613, index 78.7.

380
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:35,048
Drug evasion, malicious sexual
perversion and transgression.

381
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,219
Immediate destruction on the basis
of an ECO-TRX 314...

382
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,889
...incurable imbalance
with socially deteriorating conscience.

383
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,016
Reject.
Reject.

384
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,811
Inefficient, unwarranted destruction.

385
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,859
- Must be saved...
- Allowed erotics to exist...

386
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,779
- Inane. What is the prosecution doing?
- But there can be no doubt...

387
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,783
- Records show he is of clinic origin.
- Remotely subject to alteration.

388
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,536
If society is to free itself
of these deviants...

389
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,622
- This is not a race issue.
- He must be destroyed.

390
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,417
We must not continue
to consume these erotics.

391
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,919
We must exterminate the source of sin.

392
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:17,424
Economics must not dictate situations
which are obviously religious.

393
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,970
Masses won.
Defendant used, not destroyed.

394
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,471
Case rest.

395
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,440
1138, prefix THX...

396
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,151
...is pronounced incurable...

397
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,279
...and shall be conditioned...

398
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,157
...and held in detention.

399
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,764
Are you now?

400
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,974
Or have you ever been?

401
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,605
1642, try 612.

402
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,941
He seems to have an 818.

403
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,026
Can you feel this?

404
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,195
4814...

405
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,615
...avoid the 714 and the 2336.

406
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,325
All right.

407
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,122
3334, that's right.

408
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,918
Concentrate on the tri-14 area.

409
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,630
Move slowly.

410
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,926
63410.
Wait for 32.

411
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,515
9.

412
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,643
3437.

413
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,234
Now the 5552.

414
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,154
The 4105.

415
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:08,201
Above the 521.
The 122.

416
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,830
Skip the 1114.

417
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,375
- What do you say, 56?
- The 321.

418
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,168
And 21.

419
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,920
Under the 69.

420
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,340
That's enough.

421
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,246
Can I borrow one of your etracenes?

422
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,540
Sure.

423
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,376
I think that the lesson'll go
a lot better...

424
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,546
Let's write this up.
You said 45 on the...

425
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,048
All right.
Should we zoom this a little here?

426
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,217
Here, I'll just zoom it.

427
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,927
Hey, doesn't it zoom like...?

428
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,264
Now, what have you been
checked out on over at level 387?

429
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,559
Well, at 387, our system
was never completed. We'd use...

430
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,896
So you haven't any experience
with the Mark 8 board? Never...

431
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,106
No, but the Mark 7, you had the same...

432
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:29,068
You could just open them up as if...
Open all four up.

433
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,529
Yeah.
You ought to be careful about the...

434
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,869
You got any polarity here
on the mobile travel? Look.

435
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,955
- What...?
- I just punched up one and I'm opening...

436
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:49,881
...imagine that that has something to do
with the results the 378 was getting.

437
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,724
That's it. Okay, now watch that reading.
And as it...

438
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:04,145
- Watch the needle on 5, now. Watch...
- This... This knob is loose.

439
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,064
Wait, which switch gets it out?

440
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,983
Master at the bottom.
Okay, there we are.

441
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:14,239
What is the real dope
on the cortex bond problem, anyway?

442
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,949
You find yourself with...

443
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,457
Don't let it get above 4.8.
Look at this.

444
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,334
- Little monkey.
- I cut myself.

445
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:35,093
What if you put a dual display on it
and I punch two up?

446
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,803
Yes, you can see two at once.

447
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,931
When you see three, punch a third.
The numbers read...

448
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,310
Yeah. So it's best to go back to two.
And really, to get an accurate reading...

449
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,983
I don't see any dissolution here.
You haven't...

450
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,320
Don't let it get above 4.7.

451
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,032
Here, I'll bring these back down
a little bit.

452
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,245
- Yeah, I seem to be overloading it.
- You should put... Instead of...

453
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,002
There it is, 4.6.
All right?

454
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,879
Yes, but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

455
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,756
Yeah?

456
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,341
Are you all right?

457
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,184
What did they do to you?

458
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,901
What?
What?

459
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,236
I'm going to have a child.

460
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,329
Hold me.

461
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,748
Hold me.

462
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,890
- Come on, stand up.
- We are only here to help you.

463
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,143
- You have...
- Watch it.

464
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,687
Come on, now.
We don't wanna hurt you.

465
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,605
Let go.

466
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,650
We won't harm you.

467
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,486
We only want to help you.

468
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,708
3927, could you get him
from where you are?

469
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:27,325
THX 1138.

470
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,008
Hi.

471
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,358
I know you turned me in.

472
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,906
I'm doing quite well here anyway.

473
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,035
I'm setting some things up...

474
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,704
...but it isn't easy.

475
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:18,251
A very difficult balance, you know?

476
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:24,048
Listen. Now, let's get something straight
right from the start.

477
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,385
It's gonna take you some time
to see my overall plans.

478
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,055
So until then, stay out of things
you don't understand, right?

479
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,767
You're gonna be making things
more difficult for me.

480
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,773
It's the least you can do.

481
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,819
What's wrong with you?

482
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:54,036
- Don't be like that.
- It's all right. You're safe now.

483
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,800
When posterity judges our actions here...

484
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,429
...it will perhaps see us
not as unwilling prisoners...

485
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,764
...but as men who,
for whatever reason...

486
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:18,811
...preferred to remain as non-contributing
individuals on the edge of society.

487
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,273
- We must not let this happen.
- Countless diversions.

488
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,359
- Gentlemen, the choice is there.
- Reciting where we are.

489
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,653
- Arguing about leaving.
- Make no mistake.

490
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,781
- Predicting the future. Ridiculous.
- We must choose a leader...

491
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,452
What about keeping it livable?
...to unite us together.

492
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,165
- LUH 9998.
- LUH?

493
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,711
What happened?
Who's gone?

494
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,632
My friend, your point of view...

495
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,844
...yes, CAM, that's it.

496
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,889
Your point is well taken, CAM...

497
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,974
...but it lacks the balance
that a broader...

498
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,644
...and deeper range
of experience can lend it.

499
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,981
When I first arrived here,
I saw things as perhaps you do now.

500
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,817
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.

501
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:11,739
I longed to thrash out, to tear down,
to destroy and annihilate...

502
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:16,243
...to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.

503
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,705
Being basically levelheaded, however...

504
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,876
...I realized that my first goal
should be to study this place...

505
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,546
...where what seemed
blind circumstance had placed me.

506
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,007
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...

507
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:35,388
...and bank those flames with earnest
inquiry and honest observation.

508
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,931
"Mumblings."

509
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,894
"Mumblings," you hear? Know how many
times we listened to that speech?

510
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:46,732
Do you know how many times
we've had to listen to that speech?

511
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,860
Thinks we're as blind as him.
Know what you are?

512
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,196
You make me sick.
If we thought like you...

513
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,908
You know what I want?
I want ideas. I want one idea.

514
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,704
One idea could get us out of here!

515
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,207
We'll have to be sure it's the right idea.

516
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,544
We'll know it when we see it.
I'll know it when I see it!

517
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:10,881
Clear and straightforward
and plain as the nose on your face.

518
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,762
Talked to oneself over...

519
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,224
...believed he was going
to a place where he'd be happy.

520
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:25,896
And in so believing, he created a
veritable paradise for himself right here.

521
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,736
Unfortunately, not all of us can have
the positive conviction of LOO.

522
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:36,949
But thankfully, not all of us are burdened
with the ominous forebodings of SEN.

523
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,784
I, myself...

524
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,731
That's what I mean by the wrong idea.

525
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,796
Look, I'm not going to try to prove
the usefulness of history.

526
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,717
It is genuinely too obvious to need proof.

527
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,270
I want to help you.

528
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,774
You can help me.

529
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,776
Here.

530
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,153
Take a biscuit.

531
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,157
You understand,
we're all in this together.

532
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,827
You want to leave.
You're not like them.

533
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,662
A secret that we all get out of here...

534
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,959
Take it easy! Look at them.
It's pathetic. It's pitiful.

535
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,338
They've even begun to go into
my corner and look for things.

536
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,839
My things.

537
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,800
You're with me.

538
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,510
I know.

539
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,845
I have a contract.

540
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,306
All it says is:

541
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,646
"You're with me."

542
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,856
We're all in this together.

543
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,319
We must convince the others.

544
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,199
Later, then.

545
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,214
We need a new unity.

546
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,384
And not a unity which discourages dissent.

547
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,930
We need dissent,
but we need a creative dissent.

548
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,559
Our voices are not raised
in any harmonious chorus...

549
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:32,398
...but our differences are differences
of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.

550
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:38,904
- Tomorrow, as we...
- Nondescript 6431399.

551
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,078
- What is it?
- A shell dweller.

552
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,789
They live in the outer shell.
Quite unique.

553
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,209
There have been two here before
and they smell.

554
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,211
What do you know?

555
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,758
Come here, my friend.

556
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,760
Let me touch you.

557
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,120
What'd he just do?

558
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,248
What's wrong?

559
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,127
Your lunch is dirty.
What a waste.

560
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,671
Here, we can save some of it.

561
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,010
It's all right.

562
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,388
Everything's fine.

563
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,457
What?

564
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,669
Well, if you didn't want it,
why'd you take it?

565
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:21,840
I thought this was all settled.

566
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,888
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.

567
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,557
Leaving? Leaving what?
You can't leave.

568
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,352
You can't go.
Hey, wait.

569
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,313
I know, the smell.
Yeah, it's terrible.

570
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,650
It's a little bit...

571
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,987
Hey, you can't...
You can't leave without...

572
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,531
Just a minute.

573
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,034
Wait.
Just wait there a minute.

574
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,912
After long deliberation,
I have decided to go out...

575
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,373
...and personally examine the barrier...

576
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,501
...to learn firsthand
what difficulties are involved...

577
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,213
...and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk...

578
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:05,217
...but moments such as these require
a choice be made and action taken...

579
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,095
...regardless of the danger.
We'll be back soon...

580
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:12,224
...but we'll be gone long enough to form
an accurate and functional escape.

581
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:16,520
And I shall have an honest idea how best
to organize us into a working unit.

582
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:20,399
- The new alignment.
- Incredible.

583
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,902
Wait. Wait.
Hey, wait for me.

584
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,906
Just the thing to put them on their feet.
Show them who the leaders are.

585
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:32,036
When we get back, they'll be right there,
right in the palm of my hand.

586
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,247
There's no question.
Even old PTO would be with us...

587
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,541
...if he'd still been advised.

588
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:52,139
How far before they can't see us anymore?

589
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,059
Maybe we better sit down right here.

590
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,936
Hey, rest for a while.

591
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,773
I can't...

592
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,901
I can't see them anymore.

593
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,403
LUH.

594
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,989
You're going after LUH, aren't you?

595
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,116
Why, it's ridiculous.

596
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,953
Going after...

597
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,416
Wait, I knew there was something
I had to tell you.

598
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:23,921
LUH, you know, the other, the new LUH?

599
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:28,092
He told me he'd seen her.
He saw her just before he came out here.

600
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,761
- She's gonna be coming out here.
- How was she?

601
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,431
Very well. Very good health.
Just exactly the way...

602
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:38,143
- You're lying.
- No, I am not.

603
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,650
The air's getting thinner.

604
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:49,488
Or pressure's getting greater.

605
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,658
It's the pressure.

606
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,953
How do you feel?

607
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,373
Shouldn't be this far.

608
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,212
There's no air.

609
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,348
I haven't got the time.
You can stay here if you like.

610
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,603
I'll come with you.

611
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,319
What?

612
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,699
Look.

613
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,242
What?

614
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,745
That's a man.

615
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:42,166
It's a man. He's waving.
He's waving to us.

616
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,522
Hi.

617
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,232
Hi.

618
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,861
Hello.

619
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,908
Where'd you guys come from?

620
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,121
Well, it doesn't make any difference.
Is that food?

621
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,874
I'm starving.
Do you mind?

622
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,463
How did you get here?

623
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,465
I mean, I was lost.

624
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,717
You're not lost now?

625
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,720
Know the way out?

626
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,223
- That's the way out.
- That's the way we came.

627
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,768
Yeah, but maybe you traveled in circles.
That's the way out.

628
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,228
How do you know?

629
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,896
Well, look.

630
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,191
Look more closely.
You see?

631
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,401
Come on.

632
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,111
Yeah.

633
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,133
Nothing stopped us.

634
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,470
Come on.

635
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,640
Here's a doorway.

636
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,977
Keep causeways clean.

637
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,773
Save time.
Save lives.

638
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,111
Keep causeways clean.

639
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,031
Save time, save lives.

640
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,995
Keep causeways clean.

641
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,456
Save time, save lives.

642
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,002
Keep causeways clean.

643
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,172
Save time, save lives.

644
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:00,137
Keep causeways clean.

645
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,517
Save time, save lives.

646
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,986
Hello, 12.
This is security B.

647
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,404
Read me, synapse module?

648
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,740
Research into relay system
must be given...

649
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,495
...intercerebral process reported earlier.

650
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,376
How shall the new environment
be programmed?

651
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,880
It all happened so slowly that...

652
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:39,718
...most men failed to realize
that anything had happened at all.

653
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,057
I wonder what happened to SEN.

654
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,893
We'll never make it through that main way.

655
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,730
- Who are you?
- I'm a hologram.

656
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,567
I'm not real.
You know, the fantasy bureau...

657
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,362
...electrically-generated realities
and all that.

658
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,368
I was stuck in the same circuit
for too long.

659
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,079
The arm and leg routine,
did you see that one?

660
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,252
I always wanted to be part
of the real world.

661
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,922
So I left.

662
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,261
Hey, look.

663
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,808
You are engaged
in an unauthorized procedure.

664
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,935
Remain where you are.
This...

665
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,896
We have a U65 on a K8.

666
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,440
Transfer all unauthorized contacts...

667
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:40,445
...in precinct 688 Con-G
to this center, mode 7.

668
01:01:54,627 --> 01:02:00,841
Termination of exurban links DD, NEC-08.

669
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:05,929
This tram will return
to the Central Web in five minutes.

670
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:46,071
This is 91021 on case 918.
We are going to need assistance.

671
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,240
This is an electronic-restricted area.

672
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,535
It would be nice to have
three additional officers.

673
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:55,121
- Have you seen them?
- No. They must be in group 9.

674
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,374
Operation 5271.

675
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,450
Budget Control...

676
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,328
...we'd like a cost analysis
on the THX 1138 account.

677
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,997
Include all interest
and inflation percentages.

678
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:23,460
Expenditures are 649 and rising.

679
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:36,514
- What was that?
- Must be an expressway.

680
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,184
This is Budget Control.

681
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,896
The expenditure ceiling
on the THX case is 14,000 credits.

682
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:47,859
Remember, thrifty thinkers
are always under budget.

683
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:55,200
Would you like part of this?
It's not very much.

684
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,837
Did you know all the insides
are gone from all these people?

685
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,386
Halt.

686
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,944
Economics make it necessary
to terminate any operation...

687
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:16,114
...which exceeds 5 percent
of its primary budget.

688
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,784
Expenditures are 1000 and rising.

689
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,113
Things don't seem to make sense.

690
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,659
Sometimes I see things get left out...

691
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,621
...and they don't fit.

692
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,123
People don't seem to see them.

693
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,293
Or they don't know what to do.

694
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,004
Sometimes I...

695
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,131
Sometimes little...

696
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,636
A little adjustment...

697
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,180
...can make all the difference.

698
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,392
I wanna do the right thing.

699
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,686
I wanna go back.

700
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,648
I... I...

701
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,151
I can start again.

702
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,531
I can change.

703
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:44,035
I can help.

704
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,706
I just need a...

705
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,211
Need to rest up for a little while.

706
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,757
This is no place for prayer.

707
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:02,053
If you want to speak to OMM, you must
go to a unichapel, you know that.

708
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,222
- Yeah.
- What?

709
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,725
- Are you in any trouble?
- No. I'm okay. I'm going now.

710
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:11,938
What's your number and your prefix?
I'm gonna see this gets into your report.

711
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,690
No, I'm leaving now.

712
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,860
I'm sorry, I have to report all intruders.

713
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,113
- Where's your identification badge?
- I lost it.

714
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,533
You're in violation.
I'll have to report you to authorities.

715
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,119
No, it's not my time.
Please, just...

716
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,357
Trapped.

717
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,737
Trapped.

718
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,626
Looks like the only way out
is the way we came in.

719
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,758
Say, do you have any more of that food?
I'm hungry.

720
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,177
She's not there.

721
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,971
Who are you looking for?

722
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:33,269
Can you hear me? Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.

723
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:36,022
The door seems to be jammed.

724
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:39,192
Please check the lock on your side.

725
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:44,822
Everything will be all right.
We are here to help you.

726
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,200
Stay calm.

727
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:50,662
We are not going to harm you.

728
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,622
Everything will be all right.

729
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:59,629
Well, unless that computer
has made a mistake...

730
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,297
...that's your roommate.

731
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,136
No.
No, you're wrong.

732
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,685
I hope that auxiliary load holds.

733
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:16,437
I'm almost through
to the upper positive plates.

734
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:18,856
Upper positive plates?

735
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:26,155
Maybe you are right. Maybe there's
something wrong with the computer.

736
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,825
I don't know.
It's a strange life.

737
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,995
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers
and all those things.

738
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:34,956
I guess I'll never understand
any of that stuff.

739
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,334
Guess maybe holograms are not supposed to.

740
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:50,847
THX 1138 will be taken into custody...

741
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,391
...at a minimal monetary expenditure.

742
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,103
Total operation cost:
6000 credits under budget.

743
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,564
Congratulations.
Be efficient...

744
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,899
...be happy.
Thank you.

745
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,403
Are you all right in there?

746
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:13,578
Proceed to dispersal center 21.

747
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:16,414
Projected route of flight
will be transferred.

This tram will return
to the Central Web in five...

750
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,656
What is that?
An inducer?

751
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,410
- Did it fall off?
- Yeah.

752
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,083
- How...?
- What're you doing?

753
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,085
Sorry.
Excuse me.

754
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:03,753
Hello.

755
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:06,756
Let me see that again.
I think I got it.

756
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,758
Here, give me your arm.

757
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,136
You know...

758
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:15,765
...when I was at school,
it was all very different.

759
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:20,770
We used to stay in bed all the time.
Combined primary economics...

760
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,649
Combined primary economics
was a bottle about this big.

761
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,068
Took a week.

762

A visual contact with 5241 SEN.

763
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,449
Two officers to pick up felon SEN.

764
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:36,494
Officer 1088, proceed with recovery...

765
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:41,707
...of felon 5241 SEN.
Current position...

766
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:50,341
...sure to report all decibel
surges in excess of one point...

767
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:54,679
...in your zoned section
for longer than three minutes.

768
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:59,976
Jet acceleration will not be safe
to persons in dispersal area.

769
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:05,398
To avoid being singed by jet exhaust,
please exit your vehicle on the right...

770
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:09,485
...and walk through the blue zone
on the left.

...is not equipped with afterburner...

772
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,412
...you are not to park

773
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:33,050
...temporarily restricted in this area.

777
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,209
Be sure to report all decibel surges...

778
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:10,880
...in excess of 1.5
on the Murrer-Wiggins scale.

779
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:16,385
...and stand to the right. If you wish
to pass, please do so on the left.

780
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:19,555
Fourstar vehicles at the observation...

781
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,441
There's been an accident in level...

782
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:41,452
I think I ran over a Wookiee
back there on the expressway.

...proves its analogy to the J20 series.

786
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:11,440
We have an accident in 821.

787
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:13,943
Felon vehicle is a 3T Support.

788
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,737
Felon is not in vehicle.

Mutable.

792
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,958
Variable.

793
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,627
Versatile.

794
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:34,130
Moldable.

795
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,507
Movable.

796
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:39,677
Fluctuate.

797
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,346
Undulate.

You exceeded your primary budget.

832
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,520
Stop your vehicle.

833
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:26,857
You are approaching a work area.
Stop your vehicle.

834
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:31,528
You are traveling in a restricted-access
expressway. Stop your vehicle.

835
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:34,198
Do you read?

He's headed for that construction site
at tunnel 400.

Control, he's in the area.
He's now passed into expressway...

842
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,529
He appears to be headed
for that construction site.

843
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:40,556

Can you pick him up on the electroscan?
Thank you.

It sounds like shell dwellers.

849
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:53,295
He appears to be heading outside the city.

850
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,339
Repeat, he is heading outside the city.

851
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,800
All I can do is note your information.

We have to go back.

860
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:54,940
This is your last chance to return with us.

861
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:58,902
You have nowhere to go.

862
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:04,199
You cannot survive outside the city shell.

863
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:08,579
We only want to help you.

864
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:12,541
This is your last chance.
