1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Buck Rogers in the 20th century!!

2
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,040
 Buck Rogers, now adventuring
 in the ama2zing world of the 20th century.

3
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:32,280
 By turning the dial
 to project us ahead in time...

4
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,281
 ...we're able to be with Buck and friends
 in the wonderful world of the future.

5
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:39,618
 A world that sees a lot of our scientif
 and mechanical dreams come true.

6
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:43,656
 You know, there's nothing supernatural
 or mystic about Buck.

7
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,959
 He's just an ordinary, normal human being
 who keeps his wits about him.

8
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,203
 -What's wrong?
 -Nothing, nothing really.

9
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:12,204
 Ijust feel that I need
 something stronger.

10
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,441
 If you have a problem,
 don't hesitate to ask for assistance.

11
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:19,178
 -Yes, thank you, I'll be all right.
 -Call 348-FUN--

12
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,658
 What's wrong?

13
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,659
 Never mind.

14
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:36,898
 Never mind.

15
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:39,899
 Never mind.

16
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:45,337
 Never mind. Never mind.

17
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,644
 Can you feel this?

18
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,079
 What is that? Nausea?

19
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,748
 Are you now?

20
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,617
 Or have you ever been?

21
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:59,618
 Move slowly.

22
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:23,511
 Hello, is somebody else there?

23
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,314
 THX, this is inner control.

24
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:29,315
 You're off .017 to the right.
 Correct it, please.

25
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:35,454
 Make the correction, THX.

26
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:38,657
 All right, then. Just back off, THX 1 138.
 Back off for a second.

27
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:44,496
 -Okay, hold it, 1 138.
 -Hold. Hold. Hold....

28
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:48,002
 -What's wrong?
 -I need something stronger.

29
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:51,003
 Take four red capsules. In 10 minutes,
 take two more. Help is on the way.

30
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:57,776
 -What's wrong?
 -I want you to take a visual record of this.

31
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:01,082
 We found it in the patching cells.
 We killed it.

32
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,250
 Thank you for being conscientious.

33
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,620
 A visual record is being taken...

34
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,621
 ...and filed with the Department
 of Biological Flow. You have--

35
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,458
 --now out of service in one section
 of the Filo2z era--

36
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:15,461
 --shall, in any consequence
 of any law or regulation...

37
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:18,532
 ...be discharged from such service...

38
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,533
 ...but shall be delivered up on claim of
 the party to whom such service may be due.

39
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:31,944
 --and greater efficiency,
 consumption is being standardi2zed.

40
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,182
 We are sorry.

41
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:38,183
 All right then, just back off, THX 1 138.
 Back off for a second.

42
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:43,155
 All right, make the appropriate correction.

43
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:46,592
 That's it.

44
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:49,728
 Check the grid line.
 Should be 1239, 1239.

45
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,801
 All right, watch it. You're gonna
 overrid again. Bring it down.

46
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,105
 You're right next to it.

47
00:05:58,106 --> 00:05:59,740
 -That's right.
 -What's wrong?

48
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,741
 Ijust bought one of these yesterday
 and it doesn't fit my consumer...

49
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:06,881
 ...and the store doesn't have
 the other kind.

50
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:09,882
 For more enjoyment
 and greater efficiency...

51
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:13,252
 ...consumption is being standardi2zed.

52
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:14,989
 -We are sorry.
 -This is--

53
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,990
 Attention all stations,
 I have a temporary blockage...

54
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,394
 ...affecting a Red Section module.

55
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:23,230
 Must demand complete insertion
 in the overrid.

56
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,231
 It's getting into a critical phase.

57
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,703
 -What's wrong?
 -Comperson and penderal...

58
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:31,704
 -...are compatible within group 3A.
 -What's wrong, Papa?

59
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:34,907
 If you feel you are not
 properly sedated...

60
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,976
 ...call 348-844 immediately.

61
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:41,849
 Failure to do so may result...

62
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,850
 ...in prosecution
 for criminal drug evasion.

63
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:48,489
 --A. Excursions--

64
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,490
 For more enjoyment
 and greater efficiency...

65
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:54,893
 ...consumption is being standardi2zed.
 We are sorry--

66
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,998
 This is city probe scanner.

67
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:00,999
 We've run across
 some illegal sexual activity.

68
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:04,369
 It should be on your DTO screen now.

69
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:22,654
 There has been an accidnt
 in Red Sector L 14.

70
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,891
 Do not abandon your post.
 There is no danger of radiation leakage.

71
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,096
 Repeat, there has been an accidnt
 in Red Sector L 14.

72
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:36,201
 Do not abandon your post.
 There is no danger of radiation leakage.

73
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:42,374
 6241, is everything all right down there?

74
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,348
 That accidnt over in Red Sector L
 destroyed another 63 personnel...

75
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,753
 ...giving them a total
 of 242 lost to our 195.

76
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:59,691
 Keep up the good work
 and prevent accidnts.

77
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:02,928
 This shift is concluded.

78
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:09,034
 A libid leveler has been mislaid
 near the pulse-buffering gate.

79
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,939
 If you have accidntally--

80
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:23,182
 Today only, blue dendrites
 are only 47 credits. Buy now.

81
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:35,394
 Visual binaries now can previse
 and improve your reading.

82
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:50,676
 Your consumer has a factor of 98.

83
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
 Stay calm.

84
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:20,305
 This elevator has been removed
 from service.

85
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:24,376
 Please use the next elevator
 on your right.

86
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,349
 This elevator has been removed
 from service.

87
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:34,419
 Please use the next elevator--

88
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,561
 My time is yours.

89
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:42,563
 -Masses for the masses.
 -Go ahead.

90
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:45,564
 One for all. All is one.
 Masses are what we are.

91
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:48,634
 We are the masses.
 But all in all' we are masses.

92
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:51,505
 For the Party and for all'
 masses are what we are.

93
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:54,506
 Very good. Proceed.

94
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,047
 Well...

95
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,818
 ...l slipped...

96
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,819
 ...on a thermal transfer this morning.

97
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:11,023
 lt's never happened before.

98
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,931
 l wasn't concentrating enough.

99
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:19,932
 Yes, I understand.

100
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:23,437
 Things haven't been...

101
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:26,140
 -...going well.
 -Yes, fine.

102
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:29,141
 How could l be so wrong?

103
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:36,583
 My mate...

104
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:39,584
 ...has been acting very strange.

105
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:42,688
 l can't explain it.

106
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,559
 -Yes.
 -l haven't been feeling very well myself.

107
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,560
 -Yes, I understand.
 -l don't know' maybe it's me.

108
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,667
 Yes, fine.

109
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:56,668
 l needed some pinural last night.

110
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:00,973
 -l feel as if something...
 -Excellent.

111
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,944
 ...odd were happening to me.

112
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,945
 -Something that...
 -Yes?

113
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:10,148
 -...l can't understand.
 -Could you be more...

114
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,786
 ...specif?

115
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:15,589
 The sedatives.

116
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,590
 l'm taking etracene'
 but it doesn't seem strong enough.

117
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,763
 l have a hard time concentrating.

118
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,764
 You are a true believer.
 Blessings of the state.

119
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,769
 -Please' forgive me.
 -Blessings of the masses.

120
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,770
 Thou art a subject of the divine,
 created in the image of man...

121
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:37,009
 ...by the masses, for the masses.

122
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:40,879
 Let us be thankful
 we have an occupation to fill.

123
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,885
 Work hard.

124
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,821
 Increase production.

125
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:50,391
 Prevent accidnts.

126
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,326
 And...

127
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:55,095
 ...be happy.

128
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,096
 lf it will make you happy'
 just this once.

129
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:02,601
 Now' be careful' it's heavy.

130
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,780
 THX?

131
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,170
 THX?

132
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:57,858
 THX?

133
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,859
 ls that you?

134
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:23,348
 We are sorry,
 but we must deny your request.

135
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,785
 Birthborns are not allowed
 more than 5 units of enerval.

136
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,458
 Substitution of enerval for etracene...

137
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:37,531
 ...may cause
 a serious chemical imbalance.

138
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,532
 Thank you.

139
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:23,475
 Never before have we been
 so contented. Never.

140
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:29,414
 A dragon sounds like this when--

141
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:23,034
 --nine units of detuned escalatories
 have not, however...

142
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:26,504
 ...prevented virus and ordnance
 from invading our centers.

143
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:31,376
 The three recently elected representatives
 from Con 9 have again resigned...

144
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:36,114
 -...and returned to their sectors.
 -You ought to eat.

145
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:39,284
 Five felons were caught fleeing
 rehabilitation center DD2.

146
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,621
 All five have been undergoing treatment
 for drug offenses.

147
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:47,158
 -Where did you get this car?
 -I was just issued it.

148
00:15:48,062 --> 00:15:51,062
 I took it for a test drive and ran straight
 through a crowd at the dispersal center.

149
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,703
 Oh, terrible. Terrible.

150
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,006
 No. No, it was wonderful.

151
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,408
 Because I did't hit anyone, just an 1 1 14.

152
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,844
 What's this? Why did you change it?

153
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,413
 -You've seen enough.
 -Well, that's wonderful.

154
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:09,349
 -No, it's terrible.
 -You know l don't feel well.

155
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,350
 -Take your sedation.
 -That is terrible, just terrible.

156
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:17,491
 No, it was wonderful, wonderful.

157
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,492
 Because my hand,
 it was paraly2zed anyway.

158
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,129
 That was very funny.

159
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:30,702
 Remember, an enerval overdose
 may cause a serious chemical imbalance.

160
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,589
 My time is yours.

161
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:54,995
 Go ahead.

162
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,996
 What's wrong with me?

163
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:01,268
 What am l to her or she to me?
 Nothing.

164
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,269
 -Yes, fine.
 -She's an ordinary roommate.

165
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:09,710
 l share rooms with her.

166
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,711
 -Our relationship is normal' conforming.
 -Excellent.

167
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:16,149
 We share nothing...

168
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,418
 ...but space.

169
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,419
 What is she doing to me?

170
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,559
 Yes, I understand.

171
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,560
 l think l'm dying.

172
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:31,231
 Could you be more...

173
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:34,232
 ...specif?

174
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:44,344
 You are a true believer.

175
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:46,580
 Blessings of the state.

176
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:48,949
 Blessings of the masses.

177
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,950
 Thou art a subject of the divine,
 created in the image of man...

178
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:57,889
 ...by the masses, for the masses.

179
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:02,193
 Let us be thankful we have commerce.

180
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:05,296
 Buy more. Buy more now.

181
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:07,968
 Buy...

182
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:10,969
 ...and be happy.

183
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,911
 What's wrong?

184
00:18:17,912 --> 00:18:20,080
 What's wrong?

185
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:22,249
 What's wrong?

186
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,618
 What's wrong?

187
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:27,254
 What's wrong?

188
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:29,556
 What's wrong?

189
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,591
 What's wrong?

190
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:34,592
 -What's wrong?
 -Never mind.

191
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:32,517
 l was so afraid.

192
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,390
 So alone.

193
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:49,467
 l wanted to touch you...

194
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:53,638
 ...so many times.

195
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,146
 l was happy.

196
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:03,147
 Why get me involved?

197
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,791
 They know.

198
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:51,197
 They've been watching us.

199
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:54,198
 l can feel it.

200
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,936
 No one knows.

201
00:20:57,972 --> 00:21:00,972
 They're watching us now.

202
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:05,577
 No one can see us.

203
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,614
 I can...

204
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:43,615
 ...feel it.

205
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:03,001
 Twenty-four.

206
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,672
 Twenty-three.

207
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:08,673
 Twenty-two.

208
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:17,448
 6442, gate five, please.

209
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:30,294
 We've got a malfunctioning officer
 in corridr 7A.

210
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:33,931
 All right, just a minute.
 Standby, scope 1.

211
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:06,964
 lf you go back on sedation'
 you won't feel the same way about me.

212
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:14,305
 You'll report me for drug violation.

213
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:18,042
 l've got a slip movement to install
 on my next shift.

214
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:23,047
 l'll never make it the way l am now.

215
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,059
 l wouldn't turn you in' not now.

216
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,028
 -You don't--
 -l know l wouldn't.

217
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,230
 You can do it without etracene.

218
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:40,231
 -You can. l know you can.
 -Then what?

219
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:43,801
 lt can't go on forever' you know it can't.

220
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:47,907
 We could leave.

221
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:50,043
 And live in the superstructure.

222
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:53,044
 You only have one more shift left'
 don't you?

223
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:58,549
 We could be gone
 before the next series started.

224
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:19,804
 lt's all right.

225
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:23,241
 -lt's all right.
 -Standing by.

226
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,520
 What's this?

227
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:37,824
 l have to see SEN.

228
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:40,825
 l've just been given a shift change.

229
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,395
 -When?
 -Now.

230
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:45,396
 -Now?
 -He wants me to come to his quarters.

231
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:47,967
 A shift change should come
 through scheduling.

232
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:50,968
 Why should he want to see you?

233
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:53,606
 l don't know.

234
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:56,607
 -Don't go.
 -l have to. He's a G34.

235
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:59,777
 You don't have to.

236
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:05,216
 l don't trust him.
 You ought to file a report.

237
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:08,621
 No.

238
00:25:08,622 --> 00:25:11,324
 Don't make trouble.

239
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:12,859
 lt's nothing.

240
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,395
 Then why did you bring it up?

241
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:17,897
 l didn't.

242
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:20,898
 You asked me about the card.

243
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:27,874
 You're going to get us
 into trouble.

244
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,875
 Do not push or shove at the fountain.
 It's more work for the cleaning detail.

245
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:35,179
 -Did you copy that?
 -The android, the hung-over writing.

246
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,584
 Is he getting that?
 Is he copying me?

247
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:40,585
 This is borough-flow submaster.
 Control, have you got that code yet?

248
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:44,322
 I read you very badly.
 I'll check the message....

249
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,941
 -Twenty-three hunter portapods.
 -lt's you.

250
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:04,942
 -Twenty-three hunter portapods.
 -Come in' come in. Sit down.

251
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:08,179
 You know' this is really odd.
 l was just thinking about you.

252
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:12,116
 l must apologize for all this chaos.
 They moved in this morning...

253
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,988
 ...and it's been going on all day.

254
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:20,858
 The roommate was destroyed' you know.

255
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:24,061
 Terrible inconvenience.

256
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,832
 Have to try to see things in perspective'
 do what you can...

257
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,039
 ...to make things...

258
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,176
 ...fit.

259
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:40,177
 l can accept things up to a point.

260
00:26:40,414 --> 00:26:43,414
 But if you get a chance...

261
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,252
 ...to make...

262
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:49,253
 ...adjustments...

263
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:52,623
 ...you're very foolish to pass them up.

264
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:56,262
 Where is LUH?

265
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:59,263
 -What?
 -Your card' please.

266
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:03,034
 Thank you.

267
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:09,573
 This monitor is to be used for emergencies
 or special requests only.

268
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,179
 All routine information
 can easily be obtained...

269
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:18,649
 ...through the bulletin panels
 installed at--

270
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:23,289
 Why did you have LUH come here?

271
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,992
 Why are you so concerned?

272
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:28,993
 What's going on?

273
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:34,632
 l want you for my roommate.

274
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:40,671
 We'll be very good for one another.

275
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:43,276
 l don't understand. Living--

276
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:46,277
 Living selection is computed.

277
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,083
 l know what you're thinking.

278
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:53,084
 Program-shifting isn't
 that major a crime' is it?

279
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,825
 You're in violation.

280
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:01,826
 Don't say that.

281
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,030
 What have you done to LUH?
 She was here.

282
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,969
 We...

283
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,970
 ...had a long talk.

284
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:16,374
 And she agreed that it would be better
 for both of you to switch.

285
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:21,512
 She seemed to think that you weren't
 accurately mated with her in the first place.

286
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:27,651
 l'll never have another mate like ONA.

287
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,390
 You rate very high in sanitation.
 l've checked.

288
00:28:37,731 --> 00:28:40,731
 l don't feel well.

289
00:28:41,935 --> 00:28:44,935
 We'll be happy.

290
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:56,313
 Combined with the economic advantages
 of the mating structure...

291
00:28:56,817 --> 00:28:59,817
 ...it far surpasses any disadvantages
 in increased perversions.

292
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:02,688
 A final trans--

293
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:05,689
 An infinite translated mathematics
 of tolerance and charity...

294
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:09,994
 ...among artifial memory devices
 is ultimately binary.

295
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:17,134
 Stimulating rhetoric.

296
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,372
 LUH?

297
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:21,541
 Absolute.

298
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:24,542
 The theater of noise is proof
 of our potential.

299
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,079
 The circulation of prototypes.

300
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:31,715
 The golden talisman underfoot
 is phenomenon approaching.

301
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:36,921
 And in the history of now...

302
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:41,058
 ...all ethos are designed.

303
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:51,604
 Why are you here?
 You're not cleared for this area.

304
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:54,605
 You know l have a way with computers.
 l can program myself for any area' almost.

305
00:29:56,243 --> 00:29:57,910
 l'll report you.

306
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:00,680
 Listen' no need to be distressed with me.

307
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:03,681
 -Get out of here' leave me alone.
 -l've taken care of LUH.

308
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:07,253
 l programmed her to area 5450.

309
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:10,123
 The transfer should come through
 by the next series.

310
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:13,124
 You're gonna need a new roommate.

311
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:27,037
 Performance perfect
 is perfect performance.

312
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,130
 Your radiation rate is five--

313
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:56,433
 1 1 38' retract.

314
00:30:56,603 --> 00:30:58,404
 1 138, retract.

315
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:01,405
 Something is touching
 the TTO integrated logic modules.

316
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:05,044
 Switch tools.

317
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:08,045
 1 138, what's wrong?
 Would you like a stronger pill?

318
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:13,217
 1 138, you're getting talmod contact.

319
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:16,289
 Retract at 220.

320
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,958

 We're making contact...

 ...at .003.

323
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:27,466
 Now, don't overrid here.
 This is critical.

324
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:30,467
 Okay, you can start your descent.
 That's it.

325
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:33,938
 Slow down just a little bit.
 You're overriding .7.

326
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:37,808
 Okay, hold it, 1 138.

327
00:31:38,912 --> 00:31:41,514
 THX, do you read me? THX?

328

 The radiation rate...

329
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:45,551
 ...is nine.

330
00:31:45,552 --> 00:31:48,552
 THX, you're entering a critical phase.

331
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:52,792
 All right, contact. That's it.

 An explanation for blocking,
 so allow me to make correction.

340
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:26,223
 You are entering a red phase, THX.

341
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:29,727
 1 138 suffering severe sedation depletion,
 which requires mindlock and arrest.

342
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:34,431
 1 1 38 filed a violation report on SEN 5241

 ...situation white.
 Will somebody cut the mindlock?

353
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:42,134
 Clear. Clear.

354
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:45,135
 Who permitted a mindlock priority
 in magnum cell 94107?

355
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,125
 Release mindlock.

356
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:11,228
 Relapse to command monitor.
 Release mindlock.

357
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:19,937
 6241, is everything all right down there?
 Everything all right?

358
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:25,242
 Control center 626
 holds no responsibility...

359
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:28,312
 ...for error in mindlock.

360
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,784
 Control center's transreceiver,
 this is grid control.

 The power run incorporating an H020
 flame which blocked communication in the--

362
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,390
 You should've reported that
 the minute you first detected it.

363
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,760
 In any mindlock situation that is
 already put to character, try and relieve it.

364
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:01,046
 Everything will be all right.

365
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:03,382
 You are in my hands.

366
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:06,252
 l am here to protect you.

 You have nowhere to go.

 You have nowhere to go.

00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:48,492
 lnefficient' unwarranted destruction.

00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:54,200
 -Must be saved--
 -He's allowed erotics to exist--

377
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:57,201
 -lnane. What is the prosecution doing?
 -But there can be no doubt--

378
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:01,138
 -Records show he is of clinic origin.
 -Remotely subject to alteration.

379
00:36:02,142 --> 00:36:04,844
 lf society is to free itself
 of these deviants--

380
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:07,845
 -This is not a race issue.
 -He must be destroyed.

381
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,783
 We must not continue
 to consume these erotics.

382
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:13,285
 We must exterminate the source of sin.

383
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:16,286
 Economics must not dictate situations
 which are obviously religious.

384
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:20,757
 Masses won.
 Defendant used' not destroyed.

385
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:25,329
 Case rest.

386
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,772
 1 1 38' prefix THX...

 ...and held in detention.

390
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:06,071
 Are you now?

391
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:09,072
 Or have you ever been?

392
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:13,913
 1 642' try 61 2.

393
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:16,282
 He seems to have an 81 8.

394
00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:18,717
 Can you feel this?

395
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:20,553
 481 4...

396
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:23,554
 ...avoid the 71 4 and the 2336.

397
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:26,957
 All right.

398
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:31,595
 3334' that's right.

399
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:35,098
 Concentrate on the tri-1 4 area.

400
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:40,003
 Move slowly.

401
00:37:40,106 --> 00:37:43,106
 6341 0. Wait for 32.

402
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,982
 9.

403
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:52,983
 3437.

404
00:37:57,057 --> 00:38:00,057
 Now the 5552.

405
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:04,261
 The 41 05.

406
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:07,464
 Above the 521 . The 1 22.

407
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:12,703
 Skip the 1 1 1 4.

408
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,708
 -What do you say' 56?
 -The 321 .

409
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,576
 And 21 .

410
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:20,577
 Under the 69.

411
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,780
 That's enough.

412
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:59,035
 Can l borrow one of your etracenes?

413
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:01,140
 Sure.

414
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:04,141
 -l think that the lesson'll go a lot better--
 -Let's write this up. You said 45 on the--

415
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,414
 All right. Should we zoom
 this a little here?

416
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:11,583
 Here' l'll just zoom it.

417
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:13,285
 Hey' doesn't it zoom like--?

418
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:16,286
 Now' what have you been
 checked out on over at level 387?

419
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:19,623
 Well' at 387' our system
 was never completed. We'd use--

420
00:41:19,926 --> 00:41:22,926
 So you haven't any experience
 with the Mark 8 board? Never--

421
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:25,464
 No' but with the Mark 7'
 you had the same--

422
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:28,465
 You could just open them up as if--
 Open all four up.

423
00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:32,402
 Yeah. You ought to be careful
 about the....

424
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:37,808
 You got any polarity here
 on the mobile travel? Look.

425
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:41,211
 -What--?
 -l just punched up one and l'm opening--

426
00:41:45,985 --> 00:41:48,985
 --imagine that that has something to do
 with the results the 378 was getting.

427
00:41:56,796 --> 00:41:59,796
 That's it. Okay' now watch
 that reading. And as it--

428
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:03,033
 -Watch the needle on 5' now. Watch--
 -This-- This knob is loose.

429
00:42:04,504 --> 00:42:06,405
 Wait' which switch gets it out?

430
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:09,341
 -Master at the bottom.
 -Okay' there we are.

431
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:12,342
 What is the real dope
 on the cortex bond problem' anyway?

432
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:17,547
 Oh' you find yourself with--

433
00:42:20,987 --> 00:42:23,987
 -Don't let it get above 4.8.
 -Look at this.

434
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:27,991
 -Little monkey.
 -l cut myself.

435
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:34,631
 What if you put a dual display on it
 and l punch two up?

436
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:38,401
 Yes' you can see two at once. When you see
 three-- Punch a third' you'll see the numbers.

437
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:43,273
 Yeah. So it's best to go back to two.
 And really' to get an accurate reading....

438
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,280
 -l don't see any dissolution here.
 -Well' you haven't--

439
00:42:51,317 --> 00:42:54,317
 Don't let it get above 4.7.

440
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:58,390
 Here' l'll bring these back down
 a little bit.

441
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:01,391
 -Yeah' l seem to be overloading it.
 -Well' you should put-- lnstead of--

442
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:10,533
 -There it is' about 4.6 now. ls that all right?
 -Yes' but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

443
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:15,007
 Oh' yeah?

444
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:57,714
 Are you all right?

445
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,390
 What did they do to you?

446
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,267
 What? What?

447
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:18,268
 l'm going to have a child.

448
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:27,112
 Hold me.

449
00:44:27,113 --> 00:44:30,113
 Hold me.

450
00:45:23,669 --> 00:45:26,669
 -Come on' stand up.
 -We are only here to help you.

451
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:30,475
 -You have nothing--
 -Watch it.

452
00:45:30,476 --> 00:45:33,045
 Come on' now.
 We don't wanna hurt you.

453
00:45:33,046 --> 00:45:35,680
 Let go.

454
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:38,016
 We won't harm you.

455
00:45:38,017 --> 00:45:41,017
 We only want to help you.

456
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,530
 3927' could you get him
 from where you are?

457
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:26,896
 THX 1 1 38.

458
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:45,582
 Hi.

459
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:01,397
 l know you turned me in.

460
00:47:04,437 --> 00:47:07,437
 l'm doing quite well here anyway.

461
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:11,343
 l'm setting some things up...

462
00:47:11,344 --> 00:47:14,045
 ...but it isn't easy.

463
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:17,046
 A very difficult balance' you know?

464
00:47:19,952 --> 00:47:22,952
 Listen. Now' let's get something straight
 right from the start.

465
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,390
 lt's gonna take you some time
 to see my overall plan.

466
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:30,693
 So until then' stay out of things
 you don't understand' right?

467
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:34,597
 You're gonna be making things
 more difficult for me.

468
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:39,936
 lt's the least you can do.

469
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:46,075
 What's wrong with you?

470
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:51,881
 -Don't be like that.
 -lt's all right.

471
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:55,118
 You're safe now.

472
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:08,164
 When posterity judges our actions here...

473
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:11,167
 ...it will perhaps see us
 not as unwilling prisoners...

474
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:14,072
 ...but as men who'
 for whatever reason...

475
00:48:14,073 --> 00:48:17,073
 ...preferred to remain as non-contributing
 individuals on the edge of society.

476
00:48:19,178 --> 00:48:22,178
 -We must not let this happen.
 -Countless diversions.

477
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:25,615
 -Gentlemen' the choice is there.
 -Reciting where we are.

478
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:28,019
 -Arguing about leaving.
 -Make no mistake.

479
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,020
 -Predicting the future. Ridiculous.
 -We must choose a leader...

480
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,090
 -What about keeping things livable here?
 -...to unite us.

481
00:48:34,794 --> 00:48:37,794
 -LUH 9998.
 -LUH?

482
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,833
 What happened? Who's gone?

483
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:47,637
 -JOT.
 -My friend' your point of view....

484
00:48:49,475 --> 00:48:52,210
 Yes' CAM' that's it.

485
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:55,211
 Your point is well taken' CAM...

486
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:58,248
 ...but it lacks the balance that a broader
 and deeper range of experience can lend it.

487
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:03,253
 When l first arrived here'
 l saw things as perhaps you do now.

488
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,290
 Yes' l was confused about my predicament.

489
00:49:07,526 --> 00:49:10,526
 l longed to thrash out' to tear down'
 to destroy and annihilate...

490
00:49:12,098 --> 00:49:15,098
 ...to ravage' wreak havoc and plunder.

491
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:20,038
 Being basically levelheaded' however...

492
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,039
 ...l realized that my first goal
 should be to study this place...

493
00:49:24,243 --> 00:49:27,243
 ...where what seemed
 blind circumstance had placed me.

494
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,348
 Listen to the mumblings of an old man...

495
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:33,349
 ...and bank those flames
 with earnest inquiry and honest observation.

496
00:49:36,088 --> 00:49:38,390
 ""Mumblings.""

497
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:41,391
 ""Mumblings'"" you hear? Know how
 many times we've listened to that speech?

498
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:45,261
 Do you know how many times
 we've had to listen to that speech?

499
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,168
 Thinks we're as blind as him.
 Know what you are?

500
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:52,504
 You make me sick.
 lf we thought like you--

501
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:55,505
 You know what l want?
 l want ideas. l want one idea.

502
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:59,242
 One idea could get us out of here!

503
00:50:00,212 --> 00:50:02,947
 We'll just have to be sure
 it's the right idea.

504
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:05,948
 We'll find it. We'll know it when we see it.
 l'll know it when l see it!

505
00:50:06,886 --> 00:50:09,886
 Clear and straightforward
 and plain as the nose on your face.

506
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:16,959
 Talked to oneself over....

507
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:20,096
 --believed he was going
 to a place where he'd be happy.

508
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:23,533
 And in so believing' he created
 a veritable paradise for himself right here.

509
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:30,106
 Unfortunately' not all of us can have
 the positive conviction of LOO.

510
00:50:32,078 --> 00:50:35,078
 But' thankfully' not all of us are burdened
 with the ominous forebodings of SEN.

511
00:50:37,316 --> 00:50:40,316
 l' myself--

512
00:50:43,856 --> 00:50:46,856
 Now' that's what l mean
 by the wrong idea.

513
00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:50,426
 Look' l'm not going to try
 to prove the usefulness of history.

514
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:54,163
 lt is genuinely too obvious
 to need proof.

515
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:06,642
 l want to help you.

516
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,079
 You can help me.

517
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:12,450
 Here.

518
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:15,451
 Take a biscuit.

519
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:18,521
 You understand' we're all in this together.

520
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:22,160
 You want to leave. You're not like them.

521
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:24,929
 l'll see to it
 that we all get out of here.

522
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,930
 Take it easy! Look at them.
 lt's pathetic. lt's pitiful.

523
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:32,268
 They've even begun to go into
 my corner and look for things.

524
00:51:32,705 --> 00:51:34,239
 My things.

525
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,141
 You're with me.

526
00:51:36,142 --> 00:51:38,510
 l know.

527
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:40,178
 l have a contract.

528
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:43,179
 All it says is:

529
00:51:46,786 --> 00:51:48,987
 ""You're with me.""

530
00:51:48,988 --> 00:51:51,988
 We're all in this together.

531
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:56,292
 We must convince the others.

532
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:01,831
 Later' then.

533
00:52:12,511 --> 00:52:15,511
 We need a new unity.

534
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:18,581
 And not a unity
 which discourages dissent.

535
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:21,884
 We need dissent'
 but we need a creative dissent.

536
00:52:23,422 --> 00:52:26,422
 Our voices are not raised
 in any harmonious chorus...

537
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:29,926
 ...but our differences are differences
 of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.

538
00:52:32,998 --> 00:52:35,998
 -Tomorrow' as we--
 -Nondescript 6431 399.

539
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:46,444
 -What is it?
 -A shell dweller.

540
00:52:46,445 --> 00:52:49,147
 They live in the outer shell. Quite unique.

541
00:52:49,148 --> 00:52:52,148
 There have been two here before'
 and they smell.

542
00:52:52,518 --> 00:52:55,518
 What do you know?

543
00:52:58,123 --> 00:53:00,091
 Come here' my friend.

544
00:53:00,092 --> 00:53:03,092
 Let me touch you.

545
00:53:26,986 --> 00:53:28,720
 What'd he just do?

546
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:31,721
 What's wrong' huh?

547
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:35,191
 Your lunch is dirty. What a waste.

548
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:38,494
 Here' we can save some of it.

549
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,168
 lt's all right.

550
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:47,169
 Everything's fine.

551
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,232
 What?

552
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:17,233
 Well' if you didn't want it'
 why'd you take it?

553
00:54:17,636 --> 00:54:20,636
 l thought this was all settled.

554
00:54:26,478 --> 00:54:28,246
 -Where you going?
 -l'm leaving.

555
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:30,915
 Leaving? Leaving what?
 You can't leave.

556
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,885
 You can't go. Hey' wait.

557
00:54:33,886 --> 00:54:36,886
 Oh' l know' the smell. Yeah' it's terrible.

558
00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:39,958
 lt's a little bit....

559
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:42,959
 Hey' you can't--
 You can't leave without....

560
00:54:44,096 --> 00:54:45,897
 Just a minute.

561
00:54:45,898 --> 00:54:48,898
 Wait. Just wait there a minute.

562
00:54:49,401 --> 00:54:52,270
 After long deliberation'
 l have decided to go out...

563
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:54,706
 ...and personally examine the barrier...

564
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:57,707
 ...to learn firsthand
 what difficulties are involved...

565
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:00,810
 ...and decide how to overcome them.
 l recognize an element of risk...

566
00:55:01,547 --> 00:55:04,547
 ...but moments such as these require
 that a choice be made and action taken...

567
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:08,453
 ...regardless of the danger.
 We'll be back soon...

568
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:11,454
 ...but we'll be gone long enough to form
 an accurate and functional escape.

569
00:55:12,558 --> 00:55:15,558
 And l shall have an honest idea
 how best to organize us into a working unit.

570
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:19,862
 -The new alignment.
 -lncredible.

571
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:24,133
 Wait. Wait. Hey' wait for me.

572
00:55:24,236 --> 00:55:27,236
 Just the thing to put them on their feet.
 Show them who the leaders are.

573
00:55:28,273 --> 00:55:31,273
 When we get back' they'll be right there'
 right in the palm of my hand.

574
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:35,580
 There's no question.
 Even old PTO would be with us...

575
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:38,581
 ...if he'd still been advised.

576
00:55:47,793 --> 00:55:50,793
 How far before they can't
 see us anymore' huh?

577
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:55,498
 Maybe we better sit down right here.

578
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:58,834
 Hey' rest for a while.

579
00:55:59,638 --> 00:56:01,773
 l can't....

580
00:56:01,774 --> 00:56:04,774
 l can't see them anymore.

581
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:07,211
 LUH.

582
00:56:07,212 --> 00:56:09,347
 You're going after LUH' aren't you?

583
00:56:09,348 --> 00:56:12,348
 Why' it's ridiculous.

584
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:16,318
 Going after....

585
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:19,622
 Oh' wait' l knew there was something
 l had to tell you.

586
00:56:20,826 --> 00:56:23,826
 LUH' you know' the other--?
 The new LUH?

587
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:27,229
 He told me he'd seen her.
 He saw her just before he came out here.

588
00:56:28,434 --> 00:56:31,069
 -She's gonna be coming out here.
 -How was she?

589
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:34,070
 Oh' very well. Very good health.
 Just exactly the way--

590
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:37,773
 -You're lying.
 -No' l am not.

591
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:45,715
 The air's getting thinner.

592
00:56:46,618 --> 00:56:49,618
 Or pressure's getting greater.

593
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:53,723
 lt's the pressure.

594
00:56:54,393 --> 00:56:57,393
 How do you feel?

595
00:56:57,496 --> 00:57:00,496
 Shouldn't be this far.

596
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:06,836
 There's no air.

597
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:16,245
 l haven't got the time.
 You can stay here if you like.

598
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:23,285
 l'll come with you.

599
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:31,026
 What?

600
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:34,065
 Look.

601
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:37,066
 What?

602
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:39,403
 That's a man.

603
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:42,404
 lt's a man. He's waving.
 He's waving to us.

604
00:58:04,163 --> 00:58:05,963
 Hi.

605
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:08,964
 Hi.

606
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:12,401
 Hello.

607
00:58:13,672 --> 00:58:16,672
 Where'd you guys come from?

608
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:21,177
 Oh' well' it doesn't make any difference.
 ls that food?

609
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,480
 l'm starving. Do you mind?

610
00:58:27,853 --> 00:58:29,821
 How did you get here?

611
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:31,823
 l mean' l was lost.

612
00:58:31,824 --> 00:58:34,824
 You're not lost now?

613
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,061
 Know the way out?

614
00:58:37,062 --> 00:58:39,564
 -That's the way out.
 -That's the way we came.

615
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:42,565
 Yeah' but maybe you were traveling
 in circles. That's the way out.

616
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:44,535
 How do you know?

617
00:58:44,536 --> 00:58:47,071
 Well' look.

618
00:58:47,072 --> 00:58:50,072
 Look more closely. You see?

619
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:51,709
 Come on.

620
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,710
 Oh' yeah.

621
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:16,332
 Nothing stopped us.

622
00:59:17,236 --> 00:59:20,004
 Come on.

623
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:23,005
 Here's a doorway.

624
00:59:23,475 --> 00:59:26,475
 Keep causeways clean.

625
00:59:26,979 --> 00:59:29,979
 Save time. Save lives.

626
00:59:31,817 --> 00:59:34,817
 Keep causeways clean.

627
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:38,787
 Save time, save lives.

628
00:59:40,192 --> 00:59:43,192
 Keep causeways clean.

629
00:59:44,062 --> 00:59:47,062
 Save time, save lives.

630
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:51,433
 Keep causeways clean.

631
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:54,904
 Save time, save lives.

632
00:59:57,509 --> 01:00:00,509
 Keep causeways clean.

633
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:05,748
 Save time, save lives.

634
01:00:13,158 --> 01:00:16,158
 -Hello, 12.
 -Synapse module, this is security B.

635
01:00:16,328 --> 01:00:17,762
 Read me, synapse module?

636
01:00:17,763 --> 01:00:20,763
 Research into relay system
 must be given--

637
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:26,235
 --intercerebral process reported earlier.

638
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:31,507
 How shall the new environment
 be programmed?

639
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:35,246
 lt all happened so slowly that...

640
01:00:35,247 --> 01:00:38,247
 ...most men failed to realize
 that anything had happened at all.

641
01:00:42,988 --> 01:00:45,389
 l wonder what happened to SEN.

642
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,390
 We'll never make it through
 that main way.

643
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:52,094
 -Who are you?
 -l'm a hologram.

644
01:00:52,264 --> 01:00:55,264
 l'm not real. You know'
 the fantasy bureau...

645
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:58,901
 ...electrically-generated realities
 and all that.

646
01:01:01,273 --> 01:01:04,273
 l was stuck in the same circuit
 for too long.

647
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:07,676
 The arm and leg routine'
 did you see that one?

648
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:14,283
 l always wanted to be part
 of the real world.

649
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:18,754
 So l left.

650
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:24,793
 Hey' look.

651
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:28,130
 You are engaged
 in an unauthori2zed procedure.

652
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,534
 Remain where you are. This--

653
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:33,204
 We have a U65 on a K8.

654
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:35,806
 Transfer all unauthorized contacts...

655
01:01:35,807 --> 01:01:38,807
 ...in precinct 688 Con-G
 to this center' mode 7.

656
01:01:54,826 --> 01:01:57,826
 Termination of exurban links DD, NEC-08.

657
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:04,199
 This tram will return
 to the Central Web in five minutes.

658
01:03:41,533 --> 01:03:44,533
 This is 91 021 on case 91 8.
 We are going to need assistance.

659
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:48,672
 This is an electronic-restricted area.

660
01:03:48,673 --> 01:03:51,673
 lt would be nice to have
 three additional officers.

661
01:03:51,877 --> 01:03:54,877
 -Have you seen them?
 -No. They must be somewhere in group 9.

662
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,480
 Operation 5271 .

663
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,890
 Budget Control, we'd like a cost analysis
 on the THX 1 138 account.

664
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:19,363
 Include all interest
 and inflation percentages.

665
01:05:19,364 --> 01:05:22,364
 Expenditures are 649 and rising.

666
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:36,044
 -What was that?
 -Must be an expressway.

667
01:05:36,848 --> 01:05:39,848
 This is Budget Control. The expenditure
 ceiling on the THX case is 14,000 credits.

668
01:05:43,455 --> 01:05:46,455
 Remember, thrifty thinkers
 are always under budget.

669
01:05:51,763 --> 01:05:54,763
 Would you like part of this?
 lt's not very much.

670
01:06:04,476 --> 01:06:07,476
 Did you know all the insides are gone
 from all these people?

671
01:06:54,893 --> 01:06:57,893
 Halt.

672
01:07:09,741 --> 01:07:12,741
 Economics make it necessary
 to terminate any operation...

673
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:16,244
 ...which exceeds 5 percent
 of its primary budget.

674
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:19,481
 Expenditures are 1000 and rising.

675
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:57,652
 Things don't seem to make sense.

676
01:07:58,456 --> 01:08:01,456
 Sometimes l see things get left out...

677
01:08:03,228 --> 01:08:04,962
 ...and they don't fit.

678
01:08:04,963 --> 01:08:07,963
 People don't seem to see them.

679
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:11,199
 Or they don't know what to do.

680
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:13,370
 Sometimes l--

681
01:08:13,371 --> 01:08:16,173
 Sometimes little....

682
01:08:16,174 --> 01:08:19,174
 A little adjustment...

683
01:08:19,944 --> 01:08:22,944
 ...can make all the difference.

684
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:26,884
 l wanna do the right thing.

685
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:29,353
 l wanna go back.

686
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:31,955
 l.... l....

687
01:08:31,956 --> 01:08:34,956
 l can-- l can start again.

688
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:39,528
 l can change.

689
01:08:41,065 --> 01:08:44,065
 l can-- l can help.

690
01:08:46,938 --> 01:08:49,938
 l just need a....

691
01:08:50,742 --> 01:08:53,742
 Need to rest up for a little while.

692
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:58,115
 This is no place for prayer.

693
01:08:58,116 --> 01:09:01,116
 lf you want to speak to OMM'
 you must go to a unichapel' you know that.

694
01:09:02,387 --> 01:09:04,588
 -Yeah.
 -What?

695
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:07,589
 -Are you in any trouble?
 -No. l'm okay. l'm going now.

696
01:09:08,059 --> 01:09:11,059
 What's your number and your prefix?
 l'm gonna see this gets into your report.

697
01:09:12,297 --> 01:09:13,997
 No' l'm leaving now.

698
01:09:13,998 --> 01:09:16,998
 l'm sorry' l have to report all intruders.

699
01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:20,471
 -Where's your identification badge?
 -l lost it.

700
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:23,472
 You're in violation.
 l'll have to report you to the authorities.

701
01:09:23,842 --> 01:09:26,842
 -No' it's not my time.
 -Please' just--

702
01:09:54,939 --> 01:09:57,939
 Trapped.

703
01:09:59,244 --> 01:10:02,244
 Trapped.

704
01:10:12,123 --> 01:10:15,123
 Looks like the only way out
 is the way we came in.

705
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:21,796
 Say' do you have any more
 of that food? l'm hungry.

706
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:25,035
 She's not there.

707
01:10:25,036 --> 01:10:28,036
 Who are you looking for?

708
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,640
 Can you hear me? Stay calm.
 Everything will be all right.

709
01:10:33,611 --> 01:10:36,611
 The door seems to be jammed.

710
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:39,681
 Please check the lock on your side.

711
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:43,184
 Everything will be all right.
 We are here to help you.

712
01:10:45,823 --> 01:10:48,025
 Stay calm.

713
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:50,994
 We are not going to harm you.

714
01:10:50,995 --> 01:10:53,995
 Everything will be all right.

715
01:10:55,733 --> 01:10:58,733
 Well' unless that computer
 has made a mistake...

716
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:03,104
 ...that's your roommate.

717
01:11:04,676 --> 01:11:07,676
 No. No' you're wrong.

718
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,017
 l hope that auxiliary load holds.

719
01:11:14,018 --> 01:11:17,018
 l'm almost through
 to the upper positive plates.

720
01:11:17,655 --> 01:11:20,655
 Upper positive plates?

721
01:11:22,727 --> 01:11:25,727
 Maybe you are right. Maybe there's
 something wrong with the computer.

722
01:11:26,931 --> 01:11:29,166
 l don't know. lt's a strange life.

723
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:32,167
 Cybernetics' genetics' lasers
 and all those things.

724
01:11:32,303 --> 01:11:35,303
 l guess l'll never understand
 any of that stuff.

725
01:11:36,107 --> 01:11:39,107
 Guess maybe holograms
 are not supposed to.

726
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:50,785
 THX 1 138 will be taken into custody
 at a minimal monetary expenditure.

727
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:56,825
 Total operation cost:
 6000 credits under budget.

728
01:11:57,562 --> 01:11:59,896
 Congratulations. Be efficient...

729
01:11:59,897 --> 01:12:02,897
 -...be happy.
 -Thank you.

730
01:12:03,234 --> 01:12:06,234
 Are you all right in there?

731
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:14,342
 Proceed to dispersal center 21 .

734
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,679
 What is that? An inducer?

735
01:12:52,183 --> 01:12:55,183
 -Did it fall off?
 -Yeah.

736
01:12:58,356 --> 01:13:00,424
 -How--?
 -Look out. What're you doing?

737
01:13:00,425 --> 01:13:02,392
 Oh' sorry. Excuse me.

738
01:13:02,393 --> 01:13:04,094
 Hello.

739
01:13:04,095 --> 01:13:07,095
 Let me see that again.
 l think l have it.

740
01:13:07,098 --> 01:13:10,098
 Here' give me your arm.

741
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:12,736
 You know...

742
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:15,737
 ...when l was at school'
 it was all very different.

743
01:13:16,074 --> 01:13:19,074
 We used to stay in bed all the time.
 Combined primary economics....

744
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:24,979
 Combined primary economics
 was a bottle about this big.

745
01:13:25,016 --> 01:13:28,016
 Took a week.

 A brand-new 6071 .

 This lodging network converts

811

 I have a vehicle entering a restricted-access

 You havejust exceeded

 Stop your vehicle.

816
01:22:23,854 --> 01:22:26,854
 You are approaching a work area.
 Stop your vehicle.

817
01:22:27,224 --> 01:22:30,224
 You are traveling in a restricted-access
 expressway. Stop your vehicle.

818
01:22:31,895 --> 01:22:34,895
 Do you read? Do you read?

819
01:22:39,103 --> 01:22:42,103
 He appears to be headed
 for that construction site at tunnel 400.

820
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:52,580
 Approaching the restricted area...

 ...at 235 miles per hour.

822

01:23:11,035 --> 01:23:14,035
 He appears to be headed
 for that construction site.

827
01:23:39,196 --> 01:23:42,196
 Mission control--

828
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,267
 We've lost him.

829
01:24:18,268 --> 01:24:21,204

 lt sounds like shell dwellers.

833
01:24:50,934 --> 01:24:53,934
 He appears to be heading outsid the city.
 Repeat, he is heading outsid the city.

834
01:24:55,706 --> 01:24:58,706
 All I can do is note your information.

 Stand by.

 Please come back.
 You have nothing to be afraid of.

837
01:25:35,212 --> 01:25:38,212
 The THX account is 6 percent over budget.
 The case is to be terminated.

838
01:25:40,284 --> 01:25:42,652
 Discontinue operation.

839
01:25:42,653 --> 01:25:45,388

 This is your last chance
 to return with us.

843
01:25:56,233 --> 01:25:59,233
 You have nowhere to go.

844
01:25:59,236 --> 01:26:02,236
 You cannot survive outside the city shell.

845
01:26:05,042 --> 01:26:08,042
 We only want to help you.

846
01:26:09,379 --> 01:26:12,379
 This is your last chance.
