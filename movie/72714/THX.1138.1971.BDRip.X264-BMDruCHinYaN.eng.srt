00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:24,112
<i>Buck Rogers in the 20th century!</i>

2
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:28,751
<i>Buck Rogers, now adventuring in the amazing world of the 20th century.</i>

3
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:31,916
<i>By turning the dial to project us ahead in time...</i>

4
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:36,254
<i>... we're able to be with Buck and friends in the wonderful world of the future.</i>

5
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:40,295
<i>A world that sees a lot of our scientific and mechanical dreams come true.</i>

6
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,593
<i>You know, there's nothing supernatural or mystic about Buck.</i>

7
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:47,898
<i>He's just an ordinary, normal human being who keeps his wits about him.</i>

8
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,837
<i>- What's wrong? - Nothing, nothing really.</i>

9
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:12,073
<i>I just feel that I need something stronger.</i>

10
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:15,811
<i>If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.</i>

11
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,922
<i>- Yes, thank you, I'll be all right. - Call 348-FUN...</i>

12
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,796
<i>What's wrong?</i>

13
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,696
<i>Never mind.</i>

14
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,537
<i>Never mind.</i>

15
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:41,975
<i>Never mind.</i>

16
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,807
<i>Never mind. Never mind.</i>

17
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,282
<i>Can you feel this?</i>

18
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,615
<i>What is that? Nausea?</i>

19
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,390
<i>Are you now?</i>

20
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,890
<i>Or have you ever been?</i>

21
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:58,395
<i>Move slowly.</i>

22
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,153
<i>Hello, is somebody else there?</i>

23
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,482
<i>THX, this is inner control.</i>

24
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:31,357
<i>You're off.017 to the right. Correct it, please.</i>

25
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:34,857
<i>Make the correction, THX.</i>

26
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,164
<i>All right, then. Just back off, THX 1138. Back off for a second.</i>

27
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,570
<i>- Okay, hold it, 1138. - Hold. Hold. Hold...</i>

28
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,635
<i>- What's wrong? - I need something stronger.</i>

29
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:53,409
<i>Take four red capsules. In 10 minutes, take two more. Help is on the way.</i>

30
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:57,747
<i>- What's wrong? - I want you to take a visual record of this.</i>

31
00:04:57,956 --> 00:05:00,720
<i>We found it in the patching cells. We killed it.</i>

32
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,894
<i>Thank you for being conscientious.</i>

33
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,255
<i>A visual record is being taken...</i>

34
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:08,922
<i>... and filed with the Department of Biological Flow. You have...</i>

35
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:12,099
<i>- now out of service in one section of the Filoz era...</i>

36
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:16,035
<i>- shall, in any consequence of any law or regulation...</i>

37
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:18,175
<i>... be discharged from such service...</i>

38
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:23,439
<i>... but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service may be due.</i>

39
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:33,383
<i>- And greater efficiency, consumption is being standardized.</i>

40
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:34,820
<i>We are sorry.</i>

41
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:39,429
<i>All right then, just back off, THX 1138. Back off for a second.</i>

42
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:42,933
<i>All right, make the appropriate correction.</i>

43
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,993
<i>That's it.</i>

44
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:52,441
<i>Check the grid line. Should be 1239, 1239.</i>

45
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,171
<i>All right, watch it. You're gonna override again. Bring it down.</i>

46
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:57,743
<i>You're right next to it.</i>

47
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,382
<i>- That's right. - What's wrong?</i>

48
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:03,953
<i>I just bought one of these yesterday and it doesn't fit my consumer...</i>

49
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,521
<i>... and the store doesn't have the other kind.</i>

50
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:09,888
<i>For more enjoyment and greater efficiency...</i>

51
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:13,030
<i>... consumption is being standardized.</i>

52
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:14,459
<i>- We are sorry. - This is...</i>

53
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,768
<i>Attention all stations, I have a temporary blockage...</i>

54
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,028
<i>... affecting a Red Section module.</i>

55
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,866
<i>Must demand complete insertion in the override.</i>

56
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:26,009
<i>It's getting into a critical phase.</i>

57
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,338
<i>- What's wrong? - Comperson and penderal...</i>

58
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:31,539
<i>...are compatible within group 3A. - What's wrong, Papa?</i>

59
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,617
<i>If you feel you are not properly sedated...</i>

60
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,222
<i>... call 348-844 immediately.</i>

61
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,483
<i>Failure to do so may result...</i>

62
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:46,187
<i>... in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.</i>

63
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,126
<i>- A. Excursions...</i>

64
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,530
<i>For more enjoyment and greater efficiency...</i>

65
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:55,672
<i>... consumption is being standardized. We are sorry...</i>

66
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,637
<i>This is city probe scanner.</i>

67
00:06:57,842 --> 00:07:01,005
<i>We've run across some illegal sexual activity.</i>

68
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,874
<i>It should be on your D TO screen now.</i>

69
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:22,523
<i>There has been an accident in Red Sector L 14.</i>

70
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:27,728
<i>Do not abandon your post. There is no danger of radiation leakage.</i>

71
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,842
<i>Repeat, there has been an accident in Red Sector L 14.</i>

72
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:38,710
<i>Do not abandon your post. There is no danger of radiation leakage.</i>

73
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:42,675
<i>6241, is everything all right down there?</i>

74
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:51,390
<i>That accident over in Red Sector L destroyed another 63 personnel...</i>

75
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:56,329
<i>... giving them a total of 242 lost to our 195.</i>

76
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,560
<i>Keep up the good work and prevent accidents.</i>

77
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,534
<i>This shift is concluded.</i>

78
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:10,576
<i>A libido leveler has been mislaid near the pulse-buffering gate.</i>

79
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,409
<i>If you have accidentally...</i>

80
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:26,055
<i>Today only, blue dendrites are only 47 credits. Buy now.</i>

81
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:36,697
<i>Visual binaries now can previse and improve your reading.</i>

82
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,889
<i>Your consumer has a factor of 98.</i>

83
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:00,663
Stay calm.

84
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:21,016
<i>This elevator has been removed from service.</i>

85
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:25,713
<i>Please use the next elevator on your right.</i>

86
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,060
<i>This elevator has been removed from service.</i>

87
00:09:31,262 --> 00:09:33,287
<i>Please use the next elevator...</i>

88
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,197
<i>My time is yours.</i>

89
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:42,202
<i>- Masses for the masses. - Go ahead.</i>

90
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,274
One for all. All is one. Masses are what we are.

91
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:48,378
We are the masses. But all in all, we are masses.

92
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,140
For the Party and for all, masses are what we are.

93
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:54,682
<i>Very good. Proceed.</i>

94
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,289
Well...

95
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:04,288
...I slipped...

96
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,324
...on a thermal transfer this morning.

97
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:10,130
It's never happened before.

98
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:16,573
I wasn't concentrating enough.

99
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:19,505
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

100
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:22,377
Things haven't been...

101
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,772
<i>...going well. - Yes, fine.</i>

102
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:28,509
How could I be so wrong?

103
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,186
My mate...

104
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,952
...has been acting very strange.

105
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,590
I can't explain it.

106
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:45,201
<i>- Yes. - I haven't been feeling very well myself.</i>

107
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:49,203
<i>- Yes, I understand. - I don't know, maybe it's me.</i>

108
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,174
<i>Yes, fine.</i>

109
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:56,241
I needed some pinural last night.

110
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:01,115
<i>- I feel as if something... - Excellent.</i>

111
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,583
...odd were happening to me.

112
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,313
<i>- Something that... - Yes?</i>

113
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:10,620
<i>...I can't understand. - Could you be more...</i>

114
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,421
<i>... specific?</i>

115
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,530
The sedatives.

116
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:19,870
I'm taking etracene, but it doesn't seem strong enough.

117
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,405
I have a hard time concentrating.

118
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:25,735
<i>You are a true believer. Blessings of the state.</i>

119
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:28,412
<i>- Please, forgive me. - Blessings of the masses.</i>

120
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:33,641
<i>Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man...</i>

121
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:37,117
<i>... by the masses, for the masses.</i>

122
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:42,386
<i>Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.</i>

123
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,523
<i>Work hard.</i>

124
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:46,720
<i>Increase production.</i>

125
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,031
<i>Prevent accidents.</i>

126
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,964
<i>And...</i>

127
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,138
<i>... be happy.</i>

128
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:59,239
If it will make you happy, just this once.

129
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,844
Now, be careful, it's heavy.

130
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,379
THX?

131
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,503
THX?

132
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,491
THX?

133
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,465
Is that you?

134
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:23,422
<i>We are sorry, but we must deny your request.</i>

135
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:29,089
<i>Birthborns are not allowed more than 5 units of enerval.</i>

136
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,394
<i>Substitution of enerval for etracene...</i>

137
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>... may cause a serious chemical imbalance.</i>

138
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,002
<i>Thank you.</i>

139
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,719
<i>Never before have we been so contented. Never.</i>

140
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:28,987
<i>A dragon sounds like this when...</i>

141
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,142
<i>- nine units of detuned escalatories have not, however...</i>

142
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:27,249
<i>... prevented virus and ordnance from invading our centers.</i>

143
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:32,747
<i>The three recently elected representatives from Con 9 have again resigned...</i>

144
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:35,892
<i>...and returned to their sectors. - You ought to eat.</i>

145
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:39,255
<i>Five felons were caught fleeing rehabilitation center DD2.</i>

146
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:42,456
<i>All five have been undergoing treatment for drug offenses.</i>

147
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:47,698
<i>- Where did you get this car? - I was just issued it.</i>

148
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:53,104
<i>I took it for a test drive and ran straight through a crowd at the dispersal center.</i>

149
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,339
<i>Oh, terrible. Terrible.</i>

150
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,640
<i>No. No, it was wonderful.</i>

151
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,045
<i>Because I didn't hit anyone, just an 1114.</i>

152
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,482
What's this? Why did you change it?

153
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:06,054
<i>- You've seen enough. - Well, that's wonderful.</i>

154
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,748
<i>- No, it's terrible. - You know I don't feel well.</i>

155
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:14,153
<i>- Take your sedation. - That is terrible, just terrible.</i>

156
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:17,129
<i>No, it was wonderful, wonderful.</i>

157
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,771
<i>Because my hand, it was paralyzed anyway.</i>

158
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:23,133
That was very funny.

159
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:33,541
<i>Remember, an enerval overdose may cause a serious chemical imbalance.</i>

160
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:51,799
<i>My time is yours.</i>

161
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:54,167
<i>Go ahead.</i>

162
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,773
What's wrong with me?

163
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,903
What am I to her or she to me? Nothing.

164
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:05,242
<i>- Yes, fine. - She's an ordinary roommate.</i>

165
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,350
I share rooms with her.

166
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:13,354
<i>- Our relationship is normal, conforming. - Excellent.</i>

167
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:15,355
We share nothing...

168
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,858
...but space.

169
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:20,457
What is she doing to me?

170
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,198
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

171
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:27,496
I think I'm dying.

172
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,864
<i>Could you be more...</i>

173
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:32,838
<i>... specific?</i>

174
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:43,983
<i>You are a true believer.</i>

175
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,213
<i>Blessings of the state.</i>

176
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:48,585
<i>Blessings of the masses.</i>

177
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:54,527
<i>Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man...</i>

178
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:58,828
<i>... by the masses, for the masses.</i>

179
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,937
<i>Let us be thankful we have commerce.</i>

180
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:06,007
<i>Buy more. Buy more now.</i>

181
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,609
<i>Buy...</i>

182
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:09,837
<i>... and be happy.</i>

183
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,544
<i>What's wrong?</i>

184
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:18,949
<i>What's wrong?</i>

185
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,118
<i>What's wrong?</i>

186
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:24,061
<i>What's wrong?</i>

187
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:26,521
<i>What's wrong?</i>

188
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,963
<i>What's wrong?</i>

189
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,231
<i>What's wrong?</i>

190
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:34,063
<i>- What's wrong? - Never mind.</i>

191
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,794
I was so afraid.

192
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,133
So alone.

193
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,835
I wanted to touch you...

194
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,678
...so many times.

195
00:19:58,456 --> 00:19:59,787
I was happy.

196
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,584
Why get me involved?

197
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:45,465
They know.

198
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:50,500
They've been watching us.

199
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,941
I can feel it.

200
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:56,576
No one knows.

201
00:20:57,815 --> 00:21:00,147
They're watching us now.

202
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,445
No one can see us.

203
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:40,251
<i>I can...</i>

204
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,016
<i>... feel it.</i>

205
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:01,505
<i>Twenty-four.</i>

206
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,013
<i>Twenty-three.</i>

207
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:06,540
<i>Twenty-two.</i>

208
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,920
<i>6442, gate five, please.</i>

209
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,573
<i>We've got a malfunctioning officer in corridor 7 A.</i>

210
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:33,538
<i>All right, just a minute. Standby, scope 1.</i>

211
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:08,574
If you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.

212
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:14,140
You'll report me for drug violation.

213
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:18,582
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.

214
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,552
I'll never make it the way I am now.

215
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,696
I wouldn't turn you in, not now.

216
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:34,666
- You don't... - I know I wouldn't.

217
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,863
You can do it without etracene.

218
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:40,202
- You can. I know you can. - Then what?

219
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:43,477
It can't go on forever, you know it can't.

220
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,713
We could leave.

221
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,480
And live in the superstructure.

222
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:53,084
You only have one more shift left, don't you?

223
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,623
We could be gone before the next series started.

224
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:18,444
It's all right.

225
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,109
<i>- It's all right. - Standing by.</i>

226
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:33,921
What's this?

227
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,458
I have to see SEN.

228
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:40,068
I've just been given a shift change.

229
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:42,036
- When? - Now.

230
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:45,037
- Now? - He wants me to come to his quarters.

231
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:47,608
A shift change should come through scheduling.

232
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,836
Why should he want to see you?

233
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,643
I don't know.

234
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,419
- Don't go. - I have to. He's a G34.

235
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,554
You don't have to.

236
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:05,051
I don't trust him. You ought to file a report.

237
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,320
No.

238
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,456
Don't make trouble.

239
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,499
It's nothing.

240
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:14,898
Then why did you bring it up?

241
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,934
I didn't.

242
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:20,175
You asked me about the card.

243
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,511
You're going to get us into trouble.

244
00:25:27,718 --> 00:25:31,814
<i>Do not push or shove at the fountain. It's more work for the cleaning detail.</i>

245
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:35,048
<i>- Did you copy that? - The android, the hung-over writing.</i>

246
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,227
<i>Is he getting that? Is he copying me?</i>

247
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:40,955
<i>This is borough-flow submaster. Control, have you got that code yet?</i>

248
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,794
<i>I read you very badly. I'll check the message...</i>

249
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,583
- Twenty-three hunter portapods. - It's you.

250
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:04,811
- Twenty-three hunter portapods. - Come in, come in. Sit down.

251
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,753
You know, this is really odd. I was just thinking about you.

252
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:13,623
I must apologize for all this chaos. They moved in this morning...

253
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:16,459
...and it's been going on all day.

254
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,261
The roommate was destroyed, you know.

255
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:23,099
Terrible inconvenience.

256
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:30,170
Have to try to see things in perspective, do what you can...

257
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,679
...to make things...

258
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:36,819
...fit.

259
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,784
I can accept things up to a point.

260
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:42,122
But if you get a chance...

261
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:44,894
...to make...

262
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:47,859
...adjustments...

263
00:26:49,466 --> 00:26:51,661
...you're very foolish to pass them up.

264
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,898
Where is LUH?

265
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:59,132
- What? - Your card, please.

266
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:01,276
Thank you.

267
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:11,820
<i>This monitor is to be used for emergencies or special requests only.</i>

268
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:15,287
<i>All routine information can easily be obtained...</i>

269
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:18,859
<i>... through the bulletin panels installed at...</i>

270
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:22,689
Why did you have LUH come here?

271
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:25,192
Why are you so concerned?

272
00:27:25,836 --> 00:27:27,428
What's going on?

273
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:34,308
I want you for my roommate.

274
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:40,005
We'll be very good for one another.

275
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,918
I don't understand. Living...

276
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,588
Living selection is computed.

277
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:49,625
I know what you're thinking.

278
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:53,192
Program-shifting isn't that major a crime, is it?

279
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:58,063
You're in violation.

280
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:00,637
Don't say that.

281
00:28:02,873 --> 00:28:05,535
What have you done to LUH? She was here.

282
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,668
We...

283
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,577
...had a long talk.

284
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:17,620
And she agreed that it would be better for both of you to switch.

285
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:23,292
She seemed to think that you weren't accurately mated with her in the first place.

286
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:28,191
I'll never have another mate like ONA.

287
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:33,499
You rate very high in sanitation. I've checked.

288
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:39,633
I don't feel well.

289
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:43,575
We'll be happy.

290
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:56,455
<i>Combined with the economic advantages of the mating structure...</i>

291
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,824
<i>... it far surpasses any disadvantages in increased perversions.</i>

292
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,328
<i>A final trans...</i>

293
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,628
<i>An infinite translated mathematics of tolerance and charity...</i>

294
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:12,742
<i>... among artificial memory devices is ultimately binary.</i>

295
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:16,070
<i>Stimulating rhetoric.</i>

296
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:18,675
LUH?

297
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,911
<i>Absolute.</i>

298
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,445
<i>The theater of noise is proof of our potential.</i>

299
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:28,358
<i>The circulation of prototypes.</i>

300
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,552
<i>The golden talisman underfoot is phenomenon approaching.</i>

301
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:37,700
<i>And in the history of now...</i>

302
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,836
<i>... all ethos are designed.</i>

303
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:51,240
Why are you here? You're not cleared for this area.

304
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:55,885
You know I have a way with computers. I can program myself for any area, almost.

305
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,553
I'll report you.

306
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,314
Listen, no need to be distressed with me.

307
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:04,051
- Get out of here, leave me alone. - I've taken care of LUH.

308
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,889
I programmed her to area 5450.

309
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,759
The transfer should come through by the next series.

310
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,435
You're gonna need a new roommate.

311
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,819
<i>Performance perfect is perfect performance.</i>

312
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,965
Your radiation rate is five...

313
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:55,073
1138, retract.

314
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,038
<i>1138, retract.</i>

315
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:02,241
<i>Something is touching the TTO integrated logic modules.</i>

316
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,384
<i>Switch tools.</i>

317

Under the 69.

411
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:22,284
That's enough.

412
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:58,244
Can I borrow one of your etracenes?

413
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:00,515
Sure.

414
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:06,513
- I think that the lesson'll go a lot better... - Let's write this up. You said 45 on the...

415
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:09,055
All right. Should we zoom this a little here?

416
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,226
Here, I'll just zoom it.

417
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,917
Hey, doesn't it zoom like...?

418
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:16,257
Now, what have you been checked out on over at level 387?

419
00:41:16,466 --> 00:41:19,560
Well, at 387, our system was never completed. We'd use...

420
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,897
So you haven't any experience with the Mark 8 board? Never...

421
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,097
No, but with the Mark 7, you had the same...

422
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:29,039
You could just open them up as if... Open all four up.

423
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:31,509
Yeah. You ought to be careful about the...

424
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,547
You got any polarity here on the mobile travel? Look.

425
00:41:37,753 --> 00:41:40,654
- What...? - I just punched up one and I'm opening...

426
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:49,554
- imagine that that has something to do with the results the 378 was getting.

427
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:59,364
That's it. Okay, now watch that reading. And as it...

428
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:03,841
- Watch the needle on 5, now. Watch... - This... This knob is loose.

429
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,741
Wait, which switch gets it out?

430
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:08,678
- Master at the bottom. - Okay, there we are.

431
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:13,878
What is the real dope on the cortex bond problem, anyway?

432
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:15,613
Oh, you find yourself with...

433
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:24,329
- Don't let it get above 4.8. - Look at this.

434
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,023
- Little monkey. - I cut myself.

435
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,734
What if you put a dual display on it and I punch two up?

436
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:39,607
Yes, you can see two at once. When you see three... Punch a third, you'll see the numbers.

437
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:43,979
Yeah. So it's best to go back to two. And really, to get an accurate reading...

438
00:42:46,822 --> 00:42:49,689
- I don't see any dissolution here. - Well, you haven't...

439
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,022
Don't let it get above 4.7.

440
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:57,725
Here, I'll bring these back down a little bit.

441
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:01,892
- Yeah, I seem to be overloading it. - Well, you should put... Instead of...

442
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:11,569
- There it is, about 4.6 now. Is that all right? - Yes, but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

443
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,407
Oh, yeah?

444
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,019
Are you all right?

445
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,832
What did they do to you?

446
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:14,602
What? What?

447
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,903
I'm going to have a child.

448
00:44:24,186 --> 00:44:25,983
Hold me.

449
00:44:26,655 --> 00:44:28,418
Hold me.

450

- Come on, stand up. - We are only here to help you.

451
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:29,996
- You have nothing... - Watch it.

452
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,573
Come on, now. We don't wanna hurt you.

453
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:34,472
Let go.

454
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:37,539
We won't harm you.

455
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:40,342
We only want to help you.

456
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:53,594
3927, could you get him from where you are?

457
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:27,188
THX 1138.

458
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:43,837
Hi.

459
00:46:58,128 --> 00:47:00,221
I know you turned me in.

460
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:06,796
I'm doing quite well here anyway.

461
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:10,870
I'm setting some things up...

462
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:13,566
...but it isn't easy.

463
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:18,111
A very difficult balance, you know?

464
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:23,915
Listen. Now, let's get something straight right from the start.

465
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:27,215
It's gonna take you some time to see my overall plan.

466
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:30,882
So until then, stay out of things you don't understand, right?

467
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:34,661
You're gonna be making things more difficult for me.

468
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,965
It's the least you can do.

469
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:44,706
What's wrong with you?

470
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,274
- Don't be like that. - It's all right.

471
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:53,874
You're safe now.

472
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:07,693
When posterity judges our actions here...

473
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:11,299
...it will perhaps see us not as unwilling prisoners...

474
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:13,595
...but as men who, for whatever reason...

475
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:18,707
...preferred to remain as non-contributing individuals on the edge of society.

476
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:22,140
- We must not let this happen. - Countless diversions.

477
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:25,247
- Gentlemen, the choice is there. - Reciting where we are.

478
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:27,542
- Arguing about leaving. - Make no mistake.

479
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:30,618
- Predicting the future. Ridiculous. - We must choose a leader...

480
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:34,313
- What about keeping things livable here? ...to unite us.

481
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:39,019
- LUH 9998. - LUH?

482
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:43,590
What happened? Who's gone?

483
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,496
- JOT. - My friend, your point of view...

484
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:51,731
Yes, CAM, that's it.

485
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:54,775
Your point is well taken, CAM...

486
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:59,507
...but it lacks the balance that a broader and deeper range of experience can lend it.

487
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:03,818
When I first arrived here, I saw things as perhaps you do now.

488
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:06,683
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.

489
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:11,626
I longed to thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate...

490
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:16,027
...to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.

491
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:19,566
Being basically levelheaded, however...

492
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,763
...I realized that my first goal should be to study this place...

493
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:27,410
...where what seemed blind circumstance had placed me.

494
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:29,875
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...

495
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,245
...and bank those flames with earnest inquiry and honest observation.

496
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,377
"Mumblings."

497
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:41,785
"Mumblings," you hear? Know how many times we've listened to that speech?

498
00:49:41,992 --> 00:49:46,622
Do you know how many times we've had to listen to that speech?

499
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:49,699
Thinks we're as blind as him. Know what you are?

500
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,027
You make me sick. If we thought like you...

501
00:49:52,236 --> 00:49:55,763
You know what I want? I want ideas. I want one idea.

502
00:49:55,973 --> 00:49:59,568
One idea could get us out of here!

503
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:02,468
We'll just have to be sure it's the right idea.

504
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,410
We'll find it. We'll know it when we see it. I'll know it when I see it!

505
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:10,713
Clear and straightforward and plain as the nose on your face.

506
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,625
Talked to oneself over...

507
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:20,058
- believed he was going to a place where he'd be happy.

508
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:25,725
And in so believing, he created a veritable paradise for himself right here.

509
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:31,604
Unfortunately, not all of us can have the positive conviction of LOO.

510
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:36,837
But, thankfully, not all of us are burdened with the ominous forebodings of SEN.

511
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,674
I, myself...

512
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:46,954
Now, that's what I mean by the wrong idea.

513
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:50,684
Look, I'm not going to try to prove the usefulness of history.

514
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:54,557
It is genuinely too obvious to need proof.

515
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:06,137
I want to help you.

516
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,643
You can help me.

517
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,613
Here.

518
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:14,047
Take a biscuit.

519
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:18,016
You understand, we're all in this together.

520
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:21,686
You want to leave. You're not like them.

521
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,292
I'll see to it that we all get out of here.

522
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:28,791
Take it easy! Look at them. It's pathetic. It's pitiful.

523
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:32,230
They've even begun to go into my corner and look for things.

524
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:33,698
My things.

525
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,666
You're with me.

526
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,397
I know.

527
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:39,709
I have a contract.

528
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,140
All it says is:

529
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:48,508
"You're with me."

530
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,710
We're all in this together.

531
00:51:53,023 --> 00:51:55,184
We must convince the others.

532
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:00,052
Later, then.

533
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:15,109
We need a new unity.

534
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:18,247
And not a unity which discourages dissent.

535
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:22,813
We need dissent, but we need a creative dissent.

536
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:26,452
Our voices are not raised in any harmonious chorus...

537
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:32,289
...but our differences are differences of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.

538
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:38,793
- Tomorrow, as we... - Nondescript 6431399.

539
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,974
- What is it? - A shell dweller.

540
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,667
They live in the outer shell. Quite unique.

541
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:52,042
There have been two here before, and they smell.

542
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:54,080
What do you know?

543
00:52:57,854 --> 00:52:59,617
Come here, my friend.

544
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:01,654
Let me touch you.

545
00:53:26,717 --> 00:53:28,014
What'd he just do?

546
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:31,080
What's wrong, huh?

547
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:35,016
Your lunch is dirty. What a waste.

548
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:37,557
Here, we can save some of it.

549
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:42,892
It's all right.

550
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,232
Everything's fine.

551
00:54:12,062 --> 00:54:13,324
What?

552
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:16,558
Well, if you didn't want it, why'd you take it?

553
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:20,029
I thought this was all settled.

554
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:27,767
- Where you going? - I'm leaving.

555
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:30,446
Leaving? Leaving what? You can't leave.

556
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,241
You can't go. Hey, wait.

557
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:36,142
Oh, I know, the smell. Yeah, it's terrible.

558
00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:39,483
It's a little bit...

559
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,853
Hey, you can't... You can't leave without...

560
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:45,419
Just a minute.

561
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:48,928
Wait. Just wait there a minute.

562
00:54:49,132 --> 00:54:51,794
After long deliberation, I have decided to go out...

563
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:54,232
...and personally examine the barrier...

564
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:57,339
...to learn firsthand what difficulties are involved...

565
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:01,068
...and decide how to overcome them. I recognize an element of risk...

566
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:05,078
...but moments such as these require that a choice be made and action taken...

567
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,978
...regardless of the danger. We'll be back soon...

568
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:12,087
...but we'll be gone long enough to form an accurate and functional escape.

569
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:16,385
And I shall have an honest idea how best to organize us into a working unit.

570
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:20,256
- The new alignment. - Incredible.

571
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:23,765
Wait. Wait. Hey, wait for me.

572
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:27,801
Just the thing to put them on their feet. Show them who the leaders are.

573
00:55:28,004 --> 00:55:31,872
When we get back, they'll be right there, right in the palm of my hand.

574
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:35,106
There's no question. Even old PTO would be with us...

575
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:37,371
...if he'd still been advised.

576
00:55:47,524 --> 00:55:52,018
How far before they can't see us anymore, huh?

577
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:54,925
Maybe we better sit down right here.

578
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,795
Hey, rest for a while.

579
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:00,631
I can't...

580
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,735
I can't see them anymore.

581
00:56:04,808 --> 00:56:06,241
LUH.

582
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:08,877
You're going after LUH, aren't you?

583
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:11,013
Why, it's ridiculous.

584
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:14,846
Going after...

585
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:19,754
Oh, wait, I knew there was something I had to tell you.

586
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:23,754
LUH, you know, the other...? The new LUH?

587
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,953
He told me he'd seen her. He saw her just before he came out here.

588
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:30,599
- She's gonna be coming out here. - How was she?

589
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:34,293
Oh, very well. Very good health. Just exactly the way...

590
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:37,996
- You're lying. - No, I am not.

591
00:56:42,446 --> 00:56:44,505
The air's getting thinner.

592
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,375
Or pressure's getting greater.

593
00:56:50,454 --> 00:56:52,513
It's the pressure.

594
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:55,819
How do you feel?

595
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:59,252
Shouldn't be this far.

596
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,091
There's no air.

597
00:57:12,976 --> 00:57:16,241
I haven't got the time. You can stay here if you like.

598
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:21,449
I'll come with you.

599
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:29,156
What?

600
00:57:32,128 --> 00:57:33,595
Look.

601
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,128
What?

602
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:38,628
That's a man.

603
00:57:39,135 --> 00:57:42,036
It's a man. He's waving. He's waving to us.

604
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:05,361
Hi.

605
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,094
Hi.

606
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:10,724
Hello.

607
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:15,803
Where'd you guys come from?

608
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:21,002
Oh, well, it doesn't make any difference. Is that food?

609
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:23,702
I'm starving. Do you mind?

610
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,347
How did you get here?

611
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,350
I mean, I was lost.

612
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:33,546
You're not lost now?

613
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,591
Know the way out?

614
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:39,091
- That's the way out. - That's the way we came.

615
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:42,663
Yeah, but maybe you were traveling in circles. That's the way out.

616
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,060
How do you know?

617
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:45,757
Well, look.

618
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:49,033
Look more closely. You see?

619
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:51,234
Come on.

620
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:52,999
Oh, yeah.

621
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:15,031
Nothing stopped us.

622
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:18,332
Come on.

623
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,533
Here's a doorway.

624
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:24,867
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

625
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,645
<i>Save time. Save lives.</i>

626
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:33,982
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

627
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:37,918
<i>Save time, save lives.</i>

628
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:42,858
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

629
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:46,318
<i>Save time, save lives.</i>

630
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:49,859
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

631
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:54,035
<i>Save time, save lives.</i>

632
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,970
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

641

It sounds like shell dwellers.

01:24:50,665 --> 01:24:55,227
<i>He appears to be heading outside the city. Repeat, he is heading outside the city.</i>

Please come back. You have nothing to be afraid of.

You cannot survive outside the city shell.

We only want to help you.

846
