<i>Do not push or shove at the fountain. It's more work for the cleaning detail.</i>

250
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:35,048
你聽到了嗎？ 機器人，寫的那些東西
<i>- Did you copy that? - The android, the hung-over writing.</i>

251
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,193
他成功了嗎？ 他複製了我嗎？
<i>Is he getting that? Is he copying me?</i>

252

00:36:31,114 --> 00:36:33,412
1138，姓名THX…
1138, prefix THX...

392
00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:36,107
顯然無法治癒…
...is pronounced incurable...

393
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,284
應該是有條件的…
<i>... and shall be conditioned...</i>

394
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,117
關在禁閉室裡
<i>... and held in detention.</i>

395
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:05,671
你是第一次？
Are you now?

396
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:07,940
還是以前來過？
Or have you ever been?

397
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:13,555
1642，試試612
1642, try 612.

398
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:15,918
他好像有個818
He seems to have an 818.

399
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:18,026
能感覺到這個嗎？
Can you feel this?

400
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:20,153
4814…
4814...

401
00:37:20,397 --> 00:37:23,560
避開714和2336
...avoid the 714 and the 2336.

402
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,267
好的
All right.

403
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:31,066
3334，就這樣
3334, that's right.

404
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:34,876
集中在三-14區
Concentrate on the tri-14 area.

405
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:38,575
慢點移動
Move slowly.

406
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:42,884
63410，等待32
63410. Wait for 32.

407
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:48,522
9.

408
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:51,623
3437.

409
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,232
Now the 5552.

410
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:03,129
The 4105.

411
00:38:04,307 --> 00:38:08,175
521上面，122
Above the 521. The 122.

412
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:11,776
跳過1114
Skip the 1114.

413
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,346
-你覺得怎麼樣，56？
- What do you say, 56? - The 321.

414
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,110
還有21
And 21.

415
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,445
69下面
Under the 69.

416
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:22,284
夠了
That's enough.

417
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:58,244
能借你一個通行證嗎？
Can I borrow one of your etracenes?

418
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:00,481
當然
Sure.

419
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:06,479
-我覺得這堂課會進行的更好 把這個寫下來，你說45
- I think that the lesson'll go a lot better... - Let's write this up. You said 45 on the...

420
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:09,055
好吧，我們要把這個放大些嗎？
All right. Should we zoom this a little here?

421
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,192
這個，我剛剛放大了
Here, I'll just zoom it.

422
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,894
不要放大成這樣…？
Hey, doesn't it zoom like...?

423
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:16,257
你檢查了387級別以上怎麼樣嗎？
Now, what have you been checked out on over at level 387?

424
00:41:16,466 --> 00:41:19,526
在387，我們的系統無法完成，我們通常
Well, at 387, our system was never completed. We'd use...

425
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,897
你沒有過標號8板的經歷嗎？ 沒有
So you haven't any experience with the Mark 8 board? Never...

426
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,097
沒有，不過有過標號7的，你也一樣
No, but with the Mark 7, you had the same...

427
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:29,039
就只要把它們打開就像 把四個都打開
You could just open them up as if... Open all four up.

428
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:31,509
是的，你要小心…
Yeah. You ought to be careful about the...

429
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,513
移動傳播方面有什麼極性嗎？你看
You got any polarity here on the mobile travel? Look.

430
00:41:37,753 --> 00:41:40,654
-什麼…？ 我只打開了一個，我打開
- What...? - I just punched up one and I'm opening...

431
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:49,520
看來378剛剛得到的結果有關係
- imagine that that has something to do with the results the 378 was getting.

432
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:59,330
就是這個，沒錯，注意看數據，當數據
That's it. Okay, now watch that reading. And as it...

433
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:03,841
-注意5上面的指針，注意… 這個……這個線團在鬆開
- Watch the needle on 5, now. Watch... - This... This knob is loose.

434
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,741
等等，哪個開關把它弄出來？
Wait, which switch gets it out?

435
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:08,644
-底部那個 好了，來了
- Master at the bottom. - Okay, there we are.

436
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:13,844
皮層結合處問題上的真正濃液是什麼？
What is the real dope on the cortex bond problem, anyway?

437
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:15,579
噢，你發現自己…
Oh, you find yourself with...

438
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:24,329
-不要讓數據升到4.8以上 看這個
- Don't let it get above 4.8. - Look at this.

439
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,000
-小猴子 我傷到自己
- Little monkey. - I cut myself.

440
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,700
要是你給個雙屏，我加上兩個怎麼辦？
What if you put a dual display on it and I punch two up?

441
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:39,573
你馬上就能看到兩個 當你看到三個 沖一個三級，看看數字
Yes, you can see two at once. When you see three... Punch a third, you'll see the numbers.

442
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:43,979
沒錯，最好恢復到兩個 有一個準備讀書
Yeah. So it's best to go back to two. And really, to get an accurate reading...

443
00:42:46,822 --> 00:42:49,689
-我沒看到任何分解 你沒有…
- I don't see any dissolution here. - Well, you haven't...

444
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,987
不要讓它升到4.7
Don't let it get above 4.7.

445
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:57,691
我會把這些降下來一點
Here, I'll bring these back down a little bit.

446
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:01,892
-好像超載了 你應該…而不是…
- Yeah, I seem to be overloading it. - Well, you should put... Instead of...

447
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:11,535
-就這樣，大概4.6，這樣可以吧？ 可以，不過分解是在4.5
- There it is, about 4.6 now. Is that all right? - Yes, but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

448
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,407
噢，是嗎？
Oh, yeah?

449
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,019
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

450
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,832
他們對你做了什麼
What did they do to you?

451
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:14,567
什麼？什麼？
What? What?

452
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,869
我懷孕了
I'm going to have a child.

453
00:44:24,186 --> 00:44:25,983
抱住我
Hold me.

454
00:44:26,655 --> 00:44:28,384
抱住我
Hold me.

455
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,734
-好了，站起來 我們是來幫你的
- Come on, stand up. - We are only here to help you.

456
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:29,962
-你不必…… 小心
- You have nothing... - Watch it.

457
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,573
好了，我們不想傷害你
Come on, now. We don't wanna hurt you.

458
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:34,438
放手
Let go.

459
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:37,539
我們不會傷害你
We won't harm you.

460
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:40,342
我們只想幫助你
We only want to help you.

461
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:53,594
3927，你能幫忙抓住他嗎？
3927, could you get him from where you are?

462
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:27,188
THX1138
THX 1138.

463
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:43,803
嗨
Hi.

464
00:46:58,128 --> 00:47:00,221
我知道是你把我弄進來的
I know you turned me in.

465
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:06,796
我在這過得很好
I'm doing quite well here anyway.

466
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:10,836
我在準備一些事情…
I'm setting some things up...

467
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:13,543
不過不簡單
...but it isn't easy.

468
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:18,111
一種非常難的平衡，明白嗎？
A very difficult balance, you know?

469
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:23,915
我們直接進入主題吧
Listen. Now, let's get something straight right from the start.

470
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:27,181
瞭解我的整個計劃會需要點時間
It's gonna take you some time to see my overall plan.

471
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:30,860
所以沒到那時候，不要管你 不明白的東西，明白嗎？
So until then, stay out of things you don't understand, right?

472
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:34,661
因為你會越幫越忙
You're gonna be making things more difficult for me.

473
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,965
這就是你僅有的作用
It's the least you can do.

474
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:44,706
你怎麼啦？
What's wrong with you?

475
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,274
-不要這樣 沒事的
- Don't be like that. - It's all right.

476
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:53,874
你現在安全了
You're safe now.

477
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:07,693
當後人評判我們的現在的行為
When posterity judges our actions here...

478
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:11,299
也許不好把我們看作被強迫的戰俘
...it will perhaps see us not as unwilling prisoners...

479
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:13,595
但是作為人類，不管什麼原因
...but as men who, for whatever reason...

480
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:18,707
在社會邊緣首先要保留 非貢獻性的個體
...preferred to remain as non-contributing individuals on the edge of society.

481
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:22,106
-我們不能讓這種事發生無數的轉換
- We must not let this happen. - Countless diversions.

482
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:25,247
-各位，機會來了 看看我們現在的地方
- Gentlemen, the choice is there. - Reciting where we are.

483
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:27,508
-爭論離開的問題 不要搞錯了
- Arguing about leaving. - Make no mistake.

484
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:30,618
-預言未來，荒謬 我們必須選擇一位領袖
- Predicting the future. Ridiculous. - We must choose a leader...

485
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:34,313
-保持這些東西的可居住性怎麼樣？ 把我們團結起來
- What about keeping things livable here? ...to unite us.

486
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:39,019
LUH9998 LUH？
- LUH 9998. - LUH?

487
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:43,556
怎麼啦？誰死了？
What happened? Who's gone?

488
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,496
J0T. 朋友，你的觀點…
- JOT. - My friend, your point of view...

489
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:51,731
沒錯，中央存儲器，就是這個
Yes, CAM, that's it.

490
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:54,775
你的觀點很受歡迎，中央存儲器
Your point is well taken, CAM...

491
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:59,473
不過它缺乏平衡性，經驗 更豐富的就能領導它
...but it lacks the balance that a broader and deeper range of experience can lend it.

492
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:03,818
我剛來到這時，對一切的 看法跟你差不多
When I first arrived here, I saw things as perhaps you do now.

493
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:06,649
我對自己的困境感到困惑
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.

494
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:11,626
我渴望解決，渴望狂奔，渴望毀滅
I longed to thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate...

495
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:16,027
渴望破壞，復仇，搶劫
...to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.

496
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:19,566
然後作為主要的領導人…
Being basically levelheaded, however...

497
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,763
我意識到自己的第一個目標 應該是熟悉這個地方
...I realized that my first goal should be to study this place...

498
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:27,375
好像是盲目的環境把我放到了這
...where what seemed blind circumstance had placed me.

499
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:29,875
聽聽老人的喃喃細語…
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...

500
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,245
通過認真的調查和誠實的 觀察儲存這些激情
...and bank those flames with earnest inquiry and honest observation.

501
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,377
"喃喃細語"
"Mumblings."

502
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:41,785
"喃喃細語"，你聽到了嗎？ 知道這個演說我們聽了多少次嗎？
"Mumblings," you hear? Know how many times we've listened to that speech?

503
00:49:41,992 --> 00:49:46,588
你知道這個演說我們聽了多少次嗎？
Do you know how many times we've had to listen to that speech?

504
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:49,665
以為我們跟他一樣盲目 知道你是什麼嗎？
Thinks we're as blind as him. Know what you are?

505
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,993
你讓我噁心，如果我們的 想法跟你一樣
You make me sick. If we thought like you...

506
00:49:52,236 --> 00:49:55,728
你明白我的意思嗎？ 我需要想法，我需要一個想法
You know what I want? I want ideas. I want one idea.

507
00:49:55,973 --> 00:49:59,534
一個可以帶我們離開這的想法！
One idea could get us out of here!

508
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:02,434
我們只要確定這是正確的想法
We'll just have to be sure it's the right idea.

509
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,410
會找到的，見到它我們就會明白 我看到它就能認出來！
We'll find it. We'll know it when we see it. I'll know it when I see it!

510
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:10,713
勇往直前，就像你的鼻子一樣
Clear and straightforward and plain as the nose on your face.

511
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,625
跟自己談過後…
Talked to oneself over...

512
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:20,024
相信他會找到自己快樂的地方
- believed he was going to a place where he'd be happy.

513
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:25,702
堅定這個信仰，他在這為自己 創造了真正的天堂
And in so believing, he created a veritable paradise for himself right here.

514
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:31,604
不幸的是，我們不是都能 擁有L00堅定信仰
Unfortunately, not all of us can have the positive conviction of LOO.

515
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:36,837
不過非常感謝的是，不是所有人 被SEN的兇兆壓制了
But, thankfully, not all of us are burdened with the ominous forebodings of SEN.

516
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,639
我自己…
I, myself...

517
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:46,954
這就是我對錯誤想法的意思
Now, that's what I mean by the wrong idea.

518
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:50,649
我不打算證明歷史的有效性
Look, I'm not going to try to prove the usefulness of history.

519
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:54,557
很顯然這是不需要證明的
It is genuinely too obvious to need proof.

520
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:06,137
我想幫助你
I want to help you.

521
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,643
你可以幫助我
You can help me.

522
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,613
拿著
Here.

523
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:14,047
拿著一塊點心
Take a biscuit.

524
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:17,982
你知道，我們都在一條船上
You understand, we're all in this together.

525
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:21,686
你想離開，你不像他們
You want to leave. You're not like them.

526
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,292
我希望看到我們都離開這
I'll see to it that we all get out of here.

527
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:28,791
別緊張！看看他們 又可憐，又令人同情
Take it easy! Look at them. It's pathetic. It's pitiful.

528
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:32,196
他們甚至到我的角落裡尋找東西
They've even begun to go into my corner and look for things.

529
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:33,698
我的東西
My things.

530
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,666
你跟我一條陣線
You're with me.

531
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,397
我知道
I know.

532
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:39,675
我有份合同
I have a contract.

533
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,105
上面說…
All it says is:

534
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:48,508
"你跟我在一條陣線"
"You're with me."

535
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,687
我們在一條船上了
We're all in this together.

536
00:51:53,023 --> 00:51:55,184
我們必須說服其他人
We must convince the others.

537
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:00,029
那待會兒再說
Later, then.

538
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:15,109
我們需要新的聯合
We need a new unity.

539
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:18,247
不是聯合阻礙異議
And not a unity which discourages dissent.

540
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:22,813
我們需要異議，但我們 需要創造性的異議
We need dissent, but we need a creative dissent.

541
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:26,452
我們的聲音和諧中出現的…
Our voices are not raised in any harmonious chorus...

542
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:32,254
但我們的區別重點的區別 不是基本的區別
...but our differences are differences of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.

543
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:38,759
-明天，當我們… 五名6431399
- Tomorrow, as we... - Nondescript 6431399.

544
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,974
-什麼東西？ 一個矮子
- What is it? - A shell dweller.

545
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,644
他們生活在外殼中，非常獨特
They live in the outer shell. Quite unique.

546
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:52,042
以前這有兩個，他們有氣味
There have been two here before, and they smell.

547
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:54,080
你知道嗎？
What do you know?

548
00:52:57,854 --> 00:52:59,583
過來，朋友
Come here, my friend.

549
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:01,654
讓我摸摸你
Let me touch you.

550
00:53:26,717 --> 00:53:28,014
他剛剛做了什麼
What'd he just do?

551
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:31,046
怎麼啦？
What's wrong, huh?

552
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:35,016
你的午餐髒了，真浪費
Your lunch is dirty. What a waste.

553
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:37,557
還有些可以吃
Here, we can save some of it.

554
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:42,892
沒事
It's all right.

555
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,232
一切都會好的
Everything's fine.

556
00:54:12,062 --> 00:54:13,324
幹嘛？
What?

557
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:16,558
如果你不想到，幹嘛要接啊？
Well, if you didn't want it, why'd you take it?

558
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:20,029
我以為每個人都有
I thought this was all settled.

559
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:27,767
-你去哪？ 我要走
- Where you going? - I'm leaving.

560
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:30,412
走？走什麼？你不能走
Leaving? Leaving what? You can't leave.

561
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,207
你不能走，嘿，等等
You can't go. Hey, wait.

562
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:36,108
噢，我明白了，氣味，真難聞
Oh, I know, the smell. Yeah, it's terrible.

563
00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:39,483
有點…
It's a little bit...

564
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,853
嘿，你不能…你不能就這樣走…
Hey, you can't... You can't leave without...

565
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:45,385
等等
Just a minute.

566
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:48,928
等等，就等一下
Wait. Just wait there a minute.

567
00:54:49,132 --> 00:54:51,794
經過深思熟慮，我覺得出去…
After long deliberation, I have decided to go out...

568
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:54,197
親自檢查柵欄…
...and personally examine the barrier...

569
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:57,339
瞭解第一手的困難…
...to learn firsthand what difficulties are involved...

570
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:01,033
並決定如何克服它們 我承認這有危險
...and decide how to overcome them. I recognize an element of risk...

571
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:05,078
但這樣的時刻需要做出決定，採取行動
...but moments such as these require that a choice be made and action taken...

572
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,978
別顧及危險了.我們不久回來…
...regardless of the danger. We'll be back soon...

573
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:12,087
但是我們會找到一個可以出去的口子
...but we'll be gone long enough to form an accurate and functional escape.

574
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:16,350
我會有一個真誠的想法指導這次工作
And I shall have an honest idea how best to organize us into a working unit.

575
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:20,222
新隊組合.難以置信
- The new alignment. - Incredible.

576
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:23,765
等等.嘿.等我啊
Wait. Wait. Hey, wait for me.

577
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:27,801
擺正事情.讓他們知道誰是領導者
Just the thing to put them on their feet. Show them who the leaders are.

578
00:55:28,004 --> 00:55:31,872
當我們回來時，他們會在那裡的 會在我的手掌心的
When we get back, they'll be right there, right in the palm of my hand.

579
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:35,106
毫無疑問的 就算老PT0跟著我們
There's no question. Even old PTO would be with us...

580
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:37,337
如果他仍然建議
...if he'd still been advised.

581
00:55:47,524 --> 00:55:51,984
我們走了多遠了.知道嗎？
How far before they can't see us anymore, huh?

582
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:54,925
也許我們最好坐在這裡
Maybe we better sit down right here.

583
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,760
嘿.休息一下
Hey, rest for a while.

584
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:00,631
我不能…
I can't...

585
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,735
我看不見任何人
I can't see them anymore.

586
00:56:04,808 --> 00:56:06,241
LUH
LUH.

587
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:08,877
你在追求LUH，是嗎？
You're going after LUH, aren't you?

588
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:11,013
哇，太可笑
Why, it's ridiculous.

589
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:14,846
追求…
Going after...

590
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:19,754
噢.等等.有些事我不必須得告訴你
Oh, wait, I knew there was something I had to tell you.

591
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:23,754
LUH，你知道的.另一個 新人LUH嗎？
LUH, you know, the other...? The new LUH?

592
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,919
他告訴我他已經看到她了 他在來這裡前看到她過
He told me he'd seen her. He saw her just before he came out here.

593
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:30,599
她會來這裡的 她怎樣了？
- She's gonna be coming out here. - How was she?

594
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:34,293
噢.很好.健康著呢 就是這條路
Oh, very well. Very good health. Just exactly the way...

595
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:37,996
你在撒謊.不.我沒有
- You're lying. - No, I am not.

596
00:56:42,446 --> 00:56:44,505
空氣變的稀薄
The air's getting thinner.

597
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,341
或者是大氣壓變的很強
Or pressure's getting greater.

598
00:56:50,454 --> 00:56:52,513
是大氣壓
It's the pressure.

599
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:55,819
你感覺如何？
How do you feel?

600
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:59,252
Shouldn't be this far.

601
00:57:00,227 --> 00:57:02,218
不應該走遠

602
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,057
沒有空氣
There's no air.

603
00:57:12,976 --> 00:57:16,241
我沒有時間了 如果你喜歡你就呆在這
I haven't got the time. You can stay here if you like.

604
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:21,449
我願意跟著你
I'll come with you.

605
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:29,156
那是什麼？
What?

606
00:57:32,128 --> 00:57:33,561
瞧
Look.

607
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,128
瞧什麼？
What?

608
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:38,594
有個人呢
That's a man.

609
00:57:39,135 --> 00:57:42,036
是個男的，在揮手 他在向我們揮手
It's a man. He's waving. He's waving to us.

610
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:05,327
嗨
Hi.

611
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,094
嗨
Hi.

612
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:10,690
你好
Hello.

613
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:15,803
你們從哪裡來？
Where'd you guys come from?

614
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:21,002
噢.是的.那沒什麼的 那是吃的嗎？
Oh, well, it doesn't make any difference. Is that food?

615
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:23,679
我餓了.不介意吧？
I'm starving. Do you mind?

616
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,313
你怎麼到這裡來的？
How did you get here?

617
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:31,316
我是說.我迷路了
I mean, I was lost.

618
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:33,523
你現在迷路了嗎？
You're not lost now?

619
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,591
知道出口嗎？
Know the way out?

620
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:39,091
在那裡.那是我們開始的地方
- That's the way out. - That's the way we came.

621
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:42,663
是的.也許你們在打圈圈.那是出口
Yeah, but maybe you were traveling in circles. That's the way out.

622
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,026
你如何知道的？
How do you know?

623
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:45,734
那好.瞧瞧去
Well, look.

624
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:49,033
走近點.看到了嗎？
Look more closely. You see?

625
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:51,234
來吧
Come on.

626
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:52,965
來啊
Oh, yeah.

627
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:14,997
沒什麼能阻擋我們
Nothing stopped us.

628
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:18,332
來
Come on.

629
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,533
這是出口
Here's a doorway.

630
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:24,867
保持通道暢通
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

631
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,645
節省時間.保住生命
<i>Save time. Save lives.</i>

632
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:33,982
保持通道暢通
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

633
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:37,918
節省時間.保住生命
<i>Save time, save lives.</i>

634
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:42,858
保持通道暢通
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

635
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:46,284
節省時間.保住生命
<i>Save time, save lives.</i>

636
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:49,859
保持通道暢通
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

637
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:54,035
節省時間.保住生命
<i>Save time, save lives.</i>

638
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,970
保持通道暢通
<i>Keep causeways clean.</i>

639
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:05,414
節省時間.保住生命
<i>Save time, save lives.</i>

640
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:15,824
你好.12. 神經指令艙.我是安全部門b
<i>- Hello, 12. - Synapse module, this is security B.</i>

641
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:17,287
回話，神經指令艙？
<i>Read me, synapse module?</i>

642
01:00:17,494 --> 01:00:19,621
中轉系統必須…
Research into relay system must be given...

643
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:25,366
做早期可行性報告
<i>- intercerebral process reported earlier.</i>

644
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:31,571
新的環境下計劃的如何？
How shall the new environment be programmed?

645
01:00:32,742 --> 01:00:34,733
發生的很慢…
It all happened so slowly that...

646
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:39,540
大多數人根本沒意識到有事發生
...most men failed to realize that anything had happened at all.

647
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:44,914
我想知道SEN發生什麼事
I wonder what happened to SEN.

648
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:47,749
我們從不那樣做
We'll never make it through that main way.

649
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:51,623
你是誰？我是全息圖
- Who are you? - I'm a hologram.

650
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:55,396
我不是真的.你知道的 白日做夢…
I'm not real. You know, the fantasy bureau...

651
01:00:55,632 --> 01:00:58,192
所有的都得需要電池維持
...electrically-generated realities and all that.

652
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:04,167
我在電路裡憋的太久
I was stuck in the same circuit for too long.

653
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:06,898
你看到那個胳膊和腿了嗎？
The arm and leg routine, did you see that one?

654
01:01:11,014 --> 01:01:14,142
我一直是屬於現實世界
