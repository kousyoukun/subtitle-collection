1
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,573
列车52，
从图卢兹来的，蒙托邦，

2
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:29,343
卡奥尔，brives，
利摩日，和沙托鲁，

3
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,043
现在进入车站。

4
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:43,560
这是巴黎奥斯特里茨。
所有乘客请下车。

5
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,681
...进取精神。
随流而走。

6
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:03,843
这将有助于你在材料平面上取得成功。

7
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:08,681
你的行动的范围和强度将很长。做它！

8
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:12,119
学习，运用你的想象力！

9
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:15,795
水瓶座，你的直觉很好。

10
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:20,392
你倾向于各种各样的学习和创造性的工作。

11
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,829
又浪费了2个小时！

12
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,940
人们是疯狂的！

13
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,202
Take Baby for me.

14
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:30,538
他们把这地方描述得象它的宫殿。

15
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:32,647
你一路走到巴黎，

16
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,544
当你到达那里，
这是个垃圾场。

17
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:35,775
Did you get pictures?

18
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,317
Yes.

19
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,817
他们称之为“旧的风格。”
别逗我笑！

20
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,091
A place like that is more than old.
It's a ruin.

21
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,249
Here.

22
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,261
当然，它是大的。

23
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,864
But who in their right mind
would ever live there?

24
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:55,095
我没在灌木丛中打。

25
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,363
我告诉他们，

26
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,508
“如果你不把它修好，
你会得到花生的。”

27
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,534
Max?

28
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,941
Yes, ma'am?

29
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,205
- Did you type that contract for Mr. Reinhard?
- Yes.

30
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:07,979
How do you spell that?

31
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:09,951
Like it's pronounced.

32
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,251
How do you pronounce it, then?

33
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,087
Renard.

34
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:16,919
That's what I thought.

35
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:19,194
Right, Paulot?
You did say Renard?

36
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:22,757
It's not Renard. It's Reinhard.

37
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,730
Type it all over again!

38
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,099
No, don't. Let me sit down.
I'll do it myself.

39
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:30,466
That way I'll know
it's done right for once.

40
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,075
Make yourself useful.
Get us some coffee.

41
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:41,680
I swear!

42
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:47,554
Hello.

43
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,219
Paulot, a customer.

44
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:50,984
I'm looking for an apartment.

45
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,728
Step this way.
I'll see what I can do.

46
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,352
Sit down.

47
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:58,662
- Just what are you looking for?
- A place that's all mine.

48
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:01,736
I'm sick of crashing at friends' places,
and hotels are depressing.

49
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,401
- You have to be more precise.
- In what way?

50
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,768
- What part of town?
- I don't know Paris.

51
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,275
Soissons Real Estate.

52
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:11,777
I don't care,
as long as it's near the center.

53
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:13,948
- Furnished or not?
- Unfurnished.

54
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,745
How big?

55
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,444
I don't know.
Depends on what you've got.

56
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,684
And how much
are you looking to pay?

57
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:24,919
Not too much.
As cheap as possible.

58
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:28,621
- Still, I'd like something nice.
- You have some financial guarantees?

59
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,623
I'm an actress.
I can earn 200 francs a night.

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,995
I see. That's wonderful!

61
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:34,831
I don't get top billing yet,
but that'll come.

62
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:37,598
I only have one scene,
but I give the name of the play:

63
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:38,969
Tea or Chocolate.
Have you seen it?

64
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:40,975
Tea or Chocolate? No.

65
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:43,039
I've got a ticket with me.

66
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,007
Here.

67
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:48,207
Gertrude Soissons Real Estate.

68
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:50,779
11:30! I have an audition.
Anything more you need to know?

69
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,446
No, that's all for now.

70
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,120
Well, good-bye.

71
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:28,479
Yes, call me back.

72
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,218
Really, Hector!

73
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:32,224
Girls don't just blow away in the wind.

74
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,421
Did you search the whole house?

75
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:38,396
She can't be far away.
The car's still in the garage.

76
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:41,664
Rosalie.

77
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,039
Did Madame ring?

78
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:48,576
Tell me, Rosalie. Have you seen
Mademoiselle this morning?

79
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:49,768
Mademoiselle?

80
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:52,580
Yes, Mademoiselle!
My daughter Veronique!

81
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,443
No, I haven't seen anybody.

82
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:57,245
Madame and monsieur
are the first people I've seen today.

83
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:00,878
Did you sleep well?

84
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:02,686
Not really.

85
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,326
Tea or chocolate?

86
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:07,754
Coffee, Rosalie.
Today we'll have coffee.

87
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:10,258
May I have a cup of tea?

88
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:17,969
It's a mystery! There are too many
mysteries around this house.

89
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,331
Everyone acts so mysterious!

90
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,034
Veronique ran away from home.
Nothing mysterious about that.

91
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,111
For God's sake!

92
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,811
- You dare say such a thing?
- Yes, I dare!

93
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,381
Veronique lacks for nothing here.

94
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:38,685
She's blossoming.
She's radiant and full of joy.

95
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,097
Wait. I still have my makeup on.

96
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:53,768
Nice of you to come.

97
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:56,938
I wanted to say thanks for the ticket.

98
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,769
Come in.

99
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,208
I saw your scene. It was really-

100
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,247
You have a lot of presence.

101
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,279
You think so?

102
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:08,951
Fred.

103
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,290
My name is Paulot.

104
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,262
My name's Anne Larrieu.

105
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,431
But everyone calls me Nina.

106
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,437
This radio's a piece of junk.

107
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:36,345
Now I got it.
I saw you in the play too, didn't I?

108
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:38,285
Not in the play.

109
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:39,716
I was an usher.

110
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,923
What are you doing tonight, Paulot?

111
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:47,026
Me?

112
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:48,527
Tonight?

113
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,528
- Nothing.
- Why not come with us?

114
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,266
Will you get the wine, Fred?

115
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,470
All I could find for the moment is this.

116
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,510
Let me see.

117
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:11,119
It's in terrible condition,
but it's dirt-cheap at least.

118
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:12,877
Can't ask for everything.

119
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,282
We're out of wine.
We'll have to drink water.

120
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:20,125
I found another poster today.

121
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,527
Look.

122
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,094
- What are those pictures?
- Nothing.

123
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,200
He may have found me an apartment.

124
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:30,764
What for?

125
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,805
- You unhappy here?
- No, it's just not mine.

126
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:38,772
- Isn't it good enough for you?
- I didn't say that.

127
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,182
- I just want a place of my own.
- What for?

128
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,347
To fuck anybody you want?

129
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,148
You already do that here.

130
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,485
That won't change anything.

131
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:52,958
This looks delicious.

132
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,098
What's the matter?
Ashamed in front of him?

133
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,928
Up yours, Fred.

134
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,238
Shall I tell him how you picked me up?

135
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,232
And all the others?

136
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,746
Don't worry. She'll get over it.

137
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:24,952
That's it. Go ahead.
Pack up your things.

138
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,328
Don't forget anything!

139
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,566
Because if you split on me now,
you'll never set foot in here again.

140
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:33,900
Look at her.

141
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:36,469
Three months in Paris.
Three months.

142
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,870
Screws anyone, anywhere.

143
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:43,568
But she gets upset if you say it.

144
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,044
Will you help me?

145
00:10:49,218 --> 00:10:51,186
If you're next, I wish you luck.

146
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,687
Fuck her good, then throw her out.
Some friendly advice.

147
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:55,653
Beat it! I'm glad!

148
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,316
Good riddance.
I hope you drop dead!

149
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,191
You hear? I hope you drop dead!

150
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,494
What I liked about Fred
was his one-track mind.

151
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,729
His poster collection,
his obstinate ways. You know?

152
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:08,699
Obsessed with who knows what.

153
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:11,203
There's always something
to like about a man.

154
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,274
Where are we going?

155
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,307
If you've got nowhere else,
come to my place.

156
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:16,944
- Okay.
- Only it's pretty far.

157
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:19,437
The subway's stopped running,
but we can grab a taxi.

158
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,640
No, I prefer walking.
I'm not at all sleepy.

159
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,580
- You don't mind?
- No, of course not.

160
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:25,811
- It's not too heavy, is it?
- No, it's fine.

161
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,621
Do you often go around
hurting guys that way?

162
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,294
I don't get it. At first they're glad
to jump into bed with me,

163
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,260
but afterward
they start insulting me.

164
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:38,127
I'm used to it.
I don't care anymore.

165
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,592
So you've had lots of lovers then.

166
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:41,727
I'll say!

167
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:45,567
The nights I've slept alone since I came to Paris
I could count on the fingers of one hand.

168
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:49,844
So you like Paris?

169
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,404
I love it.
Especially at night.

170
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:11,661
Do you often walk
all night long this way?

171
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,325
Sometimes I get lost,
and I won'task people for help.

172
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:17,534
It's big.

173
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,206
Too big for one man.

174
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,969
This is Quentin.
The man who never sleeps.

175
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:27,512
Sit down.

176
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:32,881
- Coffee?
- No, thanks. I'm dead tired.

177
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:36,020
I'm gonna sleep right here.

178
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:42,496
The light and the noise won't bother me.
Just pretend I'm not here.

179
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,071
I poured you a cup anyway.
You can drink it later.

180
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,240
She's gonna stay a few days
till she finds a place.

181
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,244
Poor girl doesn't know anybody else.

182
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:01,110
Let her sleep under the bridge.

183
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:02,750
Why are you being like this?

184
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:05,079
I forbid you to put anyone up here.

185
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:08,690
I never stopped you from bringing anyone
home. Don't preach to me now.

186
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,052
Nobody stays more than 24 hours.
We agreed.

187
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,057
A quickie, okay.
But no live-ins.

188
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,857
- It's not a quickie.
- Then what is it?

189
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:19,023
Honestly, you two.
Can't you keep it down a bit?

190
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,528
Can't you see someone's sleeping?

191
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:23,968
Really, Quentin. You disappoint me.

192
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,137
I hardly recognize you.

193
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,900
I met him in London four years ago.

194
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:31,273
He taught me my French.

195
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,488
Stop it, Olympia.

196
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:46,286
He's changed so much.
Isn't it strange?

197
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:47,923
Very strange.

198
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:50,288
But stranger things happen.

199
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,601
Wait. You can't just leave.

200
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,672
Wait five minutes.

201
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:00,069
Wait!

202
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,332
It's right across the street.

203
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,404
I think the Italian girl stays here too.

204
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,904
Good morning.
Do you have a room?

205
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:40,876
- Are you alone?
- Why?

206
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,880
It's a different price for two.

207
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,152
You've been very nice to me.

208
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,955
Thanks.

209
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,026
Now you can go back to your friend.

210
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:54,261
Quentin's not really a friend.

211
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,261
We only met a month ago.

212
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:58,229
We wanted the same apartment.

213
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,561
It was too expensive for either of us,

214
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,063
so we decided to share the rent.

215
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,737
Besides, I don't have any real friends.

216
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,072
I'm sorry, Paulot.
I wasn't listening.

217
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:09,775
I'm dead tired.

218
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,471
You've been in Paris three months?
Where were you before that?

219
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,813
The southwest of France.
Near Toulouse.

220
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,251
I couldn't wait to turn 18.
I was counting the days.

221
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,122
When the day finally came,

222
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,420
I packed my bags
and took the first train.

223
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:30,895
The day I arrived at the Austerlitz station
was the most wonderful day of my life.

224
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,466
But why'd you come here?

225
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,466
To be an actress, right?

226
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:41,134
Not just that.

227
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:44,238
To live my life.

228
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:49,113
Well, I might as well sleep here.

229
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,685
I want to be alone.

230
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:00,323
It's suffocating in here.

231
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:10,037
No, go away, Paulot. I'm tired.

232
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:13,140
All that walking, and besides, I'm sick of
cheap hotels, and sleeping with men -

233
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:14,366
It's too much.

234
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:17,512
Calm down.
You're just on edge. It'll pass.

235
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,106
You'll be fine.

236
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:21,910
And I left my cigarettes in the lobby.

237
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:23,616
Wait here.

238
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,130
Who is it?
Is that you, Paulot?

239
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,099
Go away or I'll scream!

240
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,570
What are you so afraid of?

241
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,744
I'm not going to kill you.

242
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:31,980
Wouldn't be hard, though.
Nobody saw me come in,

243
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:34,748
and if I work it right,
nobody would see me leave either.

244
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:38,354
You can yell all you like,
but no one would hear over the storm.

245
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,729
Besides, all the other rooms
are empty during the day.

246
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,831
What do you want?

247
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,404
Really, Hector.
Girls don't just blow away in the wind!

248
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:29,967
Did you search the whole house?

249
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:32,943
She can't be far away.
The car is still in the garage.

250
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:35,081
Rosalie.

251
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,978
Did Madame ring?

252
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:43,056
Rosalie, we were wondering.
Have you seen Mademoiselle this morning?

253
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:44,556
Mademoiselle?

254
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,717
Yes, Mademoiselle!
My daughter Veronique.

255
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:48,988
I haven't seen anybody.

256
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:52,463
Madame and Monsieur
are the first people I've seen today.

257
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,832
Did you sleep well?

258
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,495
Not really.

259
00:18:58,674 --> 00:18:59,971
Tea or chocolate?

260
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:02,508
Today we'll have coffee, Rosalie.

261
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,202
May I have a cup of tea?

262
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:07,508
Yes, call me back.

263
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:10,584
You can't just walk out on me.
We have to talk. Let's have dinner.

264
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:13,550
I'm sick of being dragged
through the mud and called a whore.

265
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:14,984
I told the truth.

266
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:18,149
I didn't sleep with anybody
when we were living together.

267
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,260
Yeah, but you've always got guys
prowling around you.

268
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:23,796
Because all I ever meet
are pricks like you.

269
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:26,864
Who are you calling a prick?
Who do you think you are, huh?

270
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,696
You small-town hick!

271
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:30,971
I taught you what little you know
about acting.

272
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,040
You'll have a great time
with that nerd you were with last night!

273
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,611
Quiet, please!
There's a play going on out there!

274
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,611
Wash your dirty laundry at home!

275
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,216
- So long, Fred.
- Out of the way!

276
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:49,385
Hector, our daughter's been kidnapped.

277
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:05,236
I saw your big scene.

278
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:06,998
Magnificent.

279
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:08,972
"Did Madame ring?"
"Tea or chocolate?"

280
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:10,372
Bravo. Great theater.

281
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:12,103
Did I ask your opinion?

282
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,111
Now get out of here!

283
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,115
Did you hear me?

284
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,221
How's it feel to take that off every night
and find there's nothing underneath?

285
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:25,484
Nothing.
That's what attracts me about you.

286
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,150
You get me?

287
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:29,829
If I'm hot for a woman,
I don't need artifice.

288
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:31,090
Kills the hard-on, in fact.

289
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,029
Get out or I'll have you thrown out.

290
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,930
Calm down.

291
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,668
You have to look at things
the way they are.

292
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,768
I want you.

293
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,739
Make up your mind - yes or no.

294
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:46,075
If it's yes, you come with me.

295
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:50,508
Say no, and you're rid of me.

296
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,215
It's up to you.
Yes or no?

297
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:57,155
You think I'm joking, huh?

298
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,350
Then say it.
See if I'm faking. Say no!

299
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:00,688
Say it!

300
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,428
Look, cut out the act.

301
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:04,225
Yes or no? Quick!

302
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:26,220
You nearly said no.
But you couldn't, right?

303
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,619
You'd have done me a favor.

304
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,382
You're crazy!

305
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,160
What kind of a game is this?

306
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,956
It's no game, believe me.

307
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,944
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't ask questions. I'm late.

308
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,311
- Late for what?
- Here we are.

309
00:21:57,686 --> 00:21:59,153
It's about time.

310
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,754
Hurry up, Quentin.

311
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,373
You'll be fine here.

312
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:39,991
The scene takes place
in Juliet's room.

313
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:44,595
She's bored in her palace.

314
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,593
Summer nights are long in Verona,

315
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,264
and youth is so short.

316
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:54,774
But what is Juliet doing?

317
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:58,603
Juliet, my child!
What are you doing in there?

318
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:01,182
Let me be, Mother.
I'm dreaming.

319
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:08,650
But what is Juliet's dream?

320
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:13,794
I'll dream on the balcony.

321
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:17,489
Shall I leave her to her solitary dreams,
or shall I shatter them for good?

322
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,998
Am I the answer to her yearning?

323
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:21,868
Or an unwelcome suitor?

324
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:23,902
She is Juliet,

325
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,470
so am I not Romeo?

326
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:30,008
They say the most innocent virgins
make the most lascivious bitches.

327
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:32,507
I intend to find out!

328
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:40,416
What are you doing here?

329
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:44,081
I've come to wish you
a pleasant night.

330
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:44,309
- Sorry, Paulot. I'm very late.
- Never mind. That's okay.

331
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:46,420
- I had an audition.
- Do you have many?

332
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:48,249
Yeah, but I never get the part.
Where is it?

333
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,516
Right here, but it's a dump.
You won't want it.

334
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,388
Yes, I will. I even have my bags.

335
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,586
I tell you, it's really disgusting.

336
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:56,992
I still want it.

337
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,828
There's no concierge or anyone around.

338
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,832
And the other floors are empty.

339
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,834
They're going
to tear the building down soon.

340
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:07,241
- I'll have something else by then.
- Let me carry a bag.

341
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:09,639
- What floor is it on?
- The second. It's right here.

342
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:12,471
Wait. Let me get the right key.

343
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,212
I could never live here.

344
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:25,854
- I find it old-fashioned and musty.
- Not me. I think it's wonderful.

345
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:27,961
Stop! It's so old.

346
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:29,858
No, it's perfect for me.

347
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:32,591
Sure you won't change
your mind in a week?

348
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,665
- You won't be scared living here?
- Scared of what?

349
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,306
I don't know.

350
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:43,740
Well, if you're positive you want it,
I'll help you fix it up.

351
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:45,743
It really is a wreck.

352
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:48,678
I can give you an old bed.
I'll help you, okay?

353
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,410
First time someone helped me
without asking for anything.

354
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:57,186
That means a lot.

355
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:01,292
Well, you mean
a lot to me too, Nina.

356
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:03,363
I've never had my own place before.

357
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:08,099
- Let's open the shutters.
- Wait till we've seen the whole place.

358
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:11,897
Look. It's much lighter in here.

359
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:18,542
Ah, that's what I like.

360
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:22,513
There are no trees out there.
I hate nature.

361
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:32,154
Go ahead. Keep going.

362
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:41,398
What's wrong?
Don't you want it?

363
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,236
Of course you do,
just like all the others.

364
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,375
Well, make it fast.

365
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:02,214
Since you're looking for payment,
go on! Have a ball.

366
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:07,124
Ah, you like it the other way.

367
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,064
Okay, go on.

368
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,163
Hurry up. Get it over with.

369
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:15,900
Do it, damn it!

370
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,994
Well, if it isn't Miss Larrieu.

371
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:22,102
Always a pleasure
to have you with us.

372
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,862
You're very early today.

373
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:26,336
I'd have preferred it
if you'd stayed later last night.

374
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,598
Oh, well. Come with me.

375
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:32,538
After the play,
Hector summons you for a curtain call.

376
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:35,877
You answer, "Coming, sir,"
and you go out and take a bow.

377
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,642
You act like a slab of wood.

378
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:42,915
At least try to smile
and say thank you.

379
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,820
I don't really give a shit
about your play.

380
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:46,756
It's hurting my career
more than helping.

381
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:48,418
Ah, your career!

382
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:51,365
Poor little twit.

383
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:07,838
I'M WAITING OUTSIDE.
COME QUICKLY! QUENTIN.

384
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,910
Hector, girls don't just
blow away in the wind!

385
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:16,948
Did you search the whole house?

386
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,855
She can't be far away.
The car's still in the garage.

387
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:22,961
Rosalie!

388
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,799
Where the hell is she?

389
00:29:35,977 --> 00:29:37,410
Where can Rosalie be?

390
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:39,739
You know she's always late.

391
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:41,479
Ad-lib.

392
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,710
Two disappearances in one day!

393
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:46,285
Unbelievable!

394
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,148
Rosalie.

395
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:52,921
- Quentin, I'm afraid.
- You're always afraid.

396
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:55,028
- I wasn't afraid before.
- Before what?

397
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,185
Before you.

398
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:58,798
What'll I do? I have no money,
no job, no anything.

399
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,824
Why did I do that?

400
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:03,493
Now you're all mine.
I hear music.

401
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:04,968
Come on.

402
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,201
Turn up the radio!

403
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:11,072
Turkey, Yugoslavia, Morocco, Spain.
What do you say?

404
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,179
No one to look for us,
no one to find us.

405
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:16,111
We'd disappear for good.
Want to run away with me?

406
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:17,715
No, I don't.

407
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:25,182
Why won't you run away with me?

408
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,158
I'm through running.
I want to go home.

409
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:29,828
All right. Let's go.

410
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,702
I have the feeling you've been
following me since we met.

411
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:44,868
I have been.
I even know where you live.

412
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:48,879
How will I pay my rent?

413
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:51,178
Come work at the sex club like me.

414
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,219
It's really easy, and the pay's good.

415
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:55,913
I can't. I just can't.

416
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:59,855
Of course, you wouldn't have your cute
little maid's costume to hide behind.

417
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,729
What you do in life,
you might as well do on stage.

418
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:05,297
What's the difference
if I fuck you in public?

419
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,626
Shut up.

420
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,299
You'd finally be taking some risks.

421
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,797
You'd put your own body on the line.

422
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:14,100
That way you'd understand
what it's all about.

423
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:20,444
You'll see. It's a great business.

424
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,406
I'll teach you.

425
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,732
I'm sorry. What are you drinking?
Let me buy you one.

426
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:52,174
A beer, please.

427
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,448
- No, I'll buy you one.
- Okay.

428
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:07,489
Not exactly talkative, are you?

429
00:32:08,196 --> 00:32:10,061
It's fine by me.
I can't stand gabby girls.

430
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:13,166
More talk means less action.
Isn't that right?

431
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,330
Thanks for walking me home.

432
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:17,698
- Ask me up for a drink?
- I've got nothing in the house.

433
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:20,432
Don't lead me on.
And I've had enough to drink.

434
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,141
You know this guy?

435
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,911
What are you after?

436
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:29,447
Just shaking the hand
of the first sucker who came along.

437
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:31,710
Who do you think you are, you bastard?

438
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,285
Get out of here!

439
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:40,721
Why don't you fight back?
Fight back!

440
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:46,894
- Beat it!
- You stay out of this!

441
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:47,864
Take that.

442
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,902
- You asshole!
- Nobody talks that way to me!

443
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:55,241
Can't you see what you've done,
you bastard?

444
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,240
See what you've done?

445
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:11,891
Lean on me, Quentin.

446
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:15,295
- Let me help you.
- I said no!

447
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:17,994
I don't want anyone's help.

448
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,772
You understand?

449
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:31,769
Say it.

450
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,777
Promise you won't help me.

451
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,080
I won't help you.

452
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,443
Why are you so scared
of me helping you?

453
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,456
There's already someone
trying to change my life,

454
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:21,094
and one is plenty.

455
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:22,388
Who?

456
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:25,365
A maniac.

457
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,931
Somebody I used to know.

458
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:32,136
Calls me up every single day.

459
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,071
To save me, so he says.

460
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:38,242
The fool.

461
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:43,076
He must have a reason to say it.

462
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,813
Sure he has a reason.

463
00:34:54,462 --> 00:34:56,430
What is it? Tell me.

464
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:02,360
Never.

465
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:08,873
I'll never tell you.

466
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:27,784
What are you doing here?

467
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,888
What about you?

468
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,722
I was just bringing some-

469
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:39,425
Don't you think we better
settle this with Nina?

470
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,766
Settle what?

471
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:43,867
You gonna weasel out of it?

472
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:46,000
No, I'm not.

473
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:47,265
Then come on.

474
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,441
Go on.

475
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,018
Sit down.

476
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,251
What's going on? Are you crazy?

477
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,912
I asked Paulot in.
This way you don't have to lie to him.

478
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,786
The three of us should
work this out together.

479
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,586
What do you say?

480
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:44,728
Ever want to fuck Paulot?

481
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,264
Stop. You're hurting me.

482
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,559
Let go!

483
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,599
How about you, Paulot?
Don't you want her?

484
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,103
Fuck off!

485
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:55,367
No use getting all uptight.

486
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:57,977
It'd be more friendly
if everyone made it with everyone.

487
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:00,906
Why won't you sleep with Paulot?
Don't you like him?

488
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,015
He could make you happy.

489
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:05,015
He's a real one-woman man.

490
00:38:05,186 --> 00:38:06,710
Isn't that right, Paulot?

491
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:10,480
You're the ideal pair, you two.

492
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,491
You want me to fix up
your other cheek the same way?

493
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:15,928
No, Nina wouldn't like that.

494
00:38:16,096 --> 00:38:18,792
- That's enough, Quentin.
- Am I bothering you?

495
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:22,760
Okay, I'll leave.

496
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:29,504
What are you doing with that guy?

497
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,540
You fool! He's the worst thing
that could happen to you.

498
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:47,386
The thought of him fucking you
is enough to make me puke!

499
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,392
How long's this been going on?

500
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:51,497
What do I care?

501
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:53,360
You have to stop now!

502
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:55,525
If you came to criticize me, go away.

503
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,933
I'm not criticizing, Nina.
I just want to warn you.

504
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,037
He'll hurt you as much as he can.

505
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,075
He loves to hurt people.
It's the only thing he talks about.

506
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:07,544
If you think you'll beat Quentin,
you're kidding yourself.

507
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:51,391
I'd like to speak to Paul Trabichet.

508
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,026
Follow me.

509
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:59,993
Paul, someone to see you.

510
00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:04,527
My name is Scrutzler.

511
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,367
I'm a friend of Quentin's.

512
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,970
I just got to Paris.
I stopped by his place.

513
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,836
They sent me here.

514
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:14,139
We lived together, but-

515
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:16,146
Could you give me his new address?

516
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:17,909
I don't understand.

517
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:20,110
I wrote him I was coming.

518
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,554
We'd set up a very important meeting.

519
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:28,191
Quentin... had an accident.

520
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:29,829
Yesterday morning.

521
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,125
He's dead.

522
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:36,630
You must be a relative.

523
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:38,397
A relative, no.

524
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:41,668
I mean... yes.

525
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,308
Yes and no.

526
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,212
I'm really very sorry,
but we had no idea who to call.

527
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,788
There's no one to call.

528
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:01,090
I'll take care of everything.

529
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:06,165
Who is that man?

530
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,025
I've heard his name before.

531
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:10,966
Whenever he'd call,
Quentin would run like the devil.

532
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:26,713
I went by the agency,
but you weren't there.

533
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,878
I waited for you till nearly 8:00.

534
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:30,921
You're all set. I got the lease.

535
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,225
It's all filled out.
I'll take care of the rent.

536
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,787
You happy? Look.

537
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,398
Hey, look.

538
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:42,761
Tell me everything
you know about Quentin.

539
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:48,632
Quentin's gone. He doesn't exist.
It doesn't matter anymore.

540
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,038
I'm sure you know something.

541
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:54,009
If Quentin wanted you to know,
he'd have told you.

542
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,445
There's nothing to be afraid of now.
You're rid of him.

543
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,786
You piss me off talking like that.
What do you want to know?

544
00:42:00,954 --> 00:42:02,751
I think he was living with some girl.

545
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:04,720
He caused an accident,
and she was killed.

546
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:05,916
What kind of accident?

547
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:08,220
I don't know,
and I don't want to know!

548
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:10,090
I've had it!

549
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:04,808
- May I ask who you are?
- Leave me alone.

550
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:13,519
Were you Quentin's friend?

551
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:16,162
I don't know.
He didn't want any friends.

552
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,055
So he was running away from you too.

553
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:29,339
What do you mean by that?

554
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:32,505
It was an accident.

555
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,647
He threw himself under a car.

556
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:36,913
Does the word suicide frighten you?

557
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:39,382
It was an accident. I saw it.

558
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,412
You got some color back.

559
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:12,212
To our meeting.

560
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,885
Cheers.

561
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:25,954
When I'm in Paris,
I always stay at this hotel.

562
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:30,330
The last time I saw Quentin,
it was here, almost a year ago.

563
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:35,898
- No word from him after that?
- Oh, yes. Strange letters.

564
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,512
I was sure it would end this way.

565
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:44,378
We had this project together,
but in spite of that, he-

566
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:49,819
You can never save anybody.

567
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:52,156
I'm going.

568
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:57,386
Are you going to leave just like that?

569
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:04,236
Did you know him a long time?

570
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,201
We met in London four years ago.

571
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,975
I was putting on Romeo and Juliet.

572
00:45:10,143 --> 00:45:12,077
I needed an actor for Romeo.

573
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:14,680
The minute he auditioned, I knew.

574
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:16,907
He was extraordinary in the role.

575
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:21,653
"I dreamed my lady came
and found me dead,

576
00:45:22,656 --> 00:45:25,090
and breathed such life with kisses
on my lips that I revived -"

577
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:26,248
Mr. Scrutzler.

578
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:28,951
Forgive me,
but I believe we had an appointment.

579
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:30,756
So we did.

580
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,660
I'll be right back.

581
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,770
Flowers for young lovers.

582
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:42,038
Flowers for young lovers.

583
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:57,384
We had a very vague agreement.
No contract was signed.

584
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:01,118
The play's been announced, dates are set,
and rehearsals are about to begin!

585
00:46:01,295 --> 00:46:03,729
Rehearsals with whom?
Who's going to play Romeo?

586
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:06,627
You insisted on a certain actor,
and we accepted him sight unseen.

587
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,258
That actor's out of the picture.
There's no reason now to do the play.

588
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:12,064
It makes no sense without him.

589
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:14,173
Flowers for young lovers.

590
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:49,599
- Thank God you're home.
- What's the matter?

591
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,328
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?

592
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:52,802
- Myself. I don't know.
- Go on in.

593
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,634
- You don't mind?
- No.

594
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:03,105
I didn't notice the first time I came by,
but it's really nice here.

595
00:48:03,283 --> 00:48:04,614
Think so?

596
00:48:04,785 --> 00:48:07,447
I did it all.
Except for Quentin's nudes.

597
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:09,418
It was an obsession with him.

598
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:13,958
I'll be sad to leave here,
but the rent's too much for me.

599
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:16,727
- How about something to eat?
- No, I'm not hungry.

600
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,364
It'll do you good.

601
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:20,494
All right.

602
00:48:22,803 --> 00:48:25,499
What will you do with Quentin's things?
Burn them?

603
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:27,205
No. Why?

604
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:30,832
I'll keep a few things.
This sweater was his. How does it look?

605
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:43,151
Would you mind if I look in his room?

606
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:46,652
No, go ahead. It's in there.

607
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:37,770
Coming?

608
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:39,837
Cut it out.
Don't start again.

609
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:43,181
I don't want to sleep with you.

610
00:49:48,522 --> 00:49:50,990
I'd really like it
if we could live together.

611
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:53,182
And watch you screwing other men?

612
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:56,492
What do you take me for, Nina?

613
00:49:57,197 --> 00:49:58,926
I won't screw anybody.

614
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,363
I give you my word.

615
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,477
I love you, Paulot.

616
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:15,878
You're the only person I love.

617
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,817
I want to live with you, but not here.
It's too expensive.

618
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:23,012
Move into my place.

619
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:27,287
We'll share the rent.
We'll share everything.

620
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:33,028
With you near me,

621
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:36,098
I'd feel better.

622
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:41,866
You've got to believe me.

623
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:44,240
You've got to trust me.

624
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:02,795
- Where are you going?
- I'll sleep over there.

625
00:51:25,151 --> 00:51:27,415
"If I may trust
the flattering truth of sleep,

626
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:29,851
my dreams presage
some joyful news at hand.

627
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,954
My bosom's lord
sits lightly in his throne,

628
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:37,260
and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts
me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.

629
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:40,159
I dreamed my lady came
and found me dead-

630
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,528
strange dream that gives
a dead man leave to think! -

631
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:47,763
and breathed such life with kisses in my lips
that I revived and was an emperor.

632
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:50,940
Ah me,
how sweet is love itself possessed

633
00:51:51,344 --> 00:51:54,245
when but love's shadows
are so rich in joy."

634
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,976
"O Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

635
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:00,443
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,

636
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,220
or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love

637
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:05,450
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

638
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:07,823
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

639
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:12,021
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

640
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:13,960
What's Montague?

641
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:16,827
It is nor hand, nor foot,
nor arm, nor face,

642
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,527
nor any other part belonging to a man."

643
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:20,639
Take her.
You won't find anybody better.

644
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:23,469
Very nice, Miss Monteil.
Thank you.

645
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:24,610
She's perfect.

646
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:27,212
No more of your excuses.
We've got you now.

647
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:30,177
She'd be perfect
if she were the right age.

648
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:32,342
Juliet is 14.

649
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,546
It's right here in the text.

650
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,686
- This is too much.
- What do we do now?

651
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:40,886
Go on auditioning?

652
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:43,523
- Anne Larrieu?
- That's me.

653
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:52,635
Good morning. Shall I begin?

654
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:55,130
Go ahead.

655
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:57,640
"Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face.

656
00:52:57,811 --> 00:53:00,405
Else would a maiden blush
be paint my cheek

657
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,048
for that which thou
hast heard me speak tonight.

658
00:53:03,216 --> 00:53:04,877
Fain would I dwell on form.
Dost thou love me?

659
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,417
I know thou wilt say "aye,"
and I will take thy word.

660
00:53:07,587 --> 00:53:09,680
Yet if thou swearest-"

661
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:12,086
That'll be all.
Thank you very much.

662
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:21,563
I'll do the play if she's Juliet.
Otherwise I'm not interested.

663
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:23,899
We've wasted enough time on this.

664
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,368
You're not being fair.
She's over 14 too!

665
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,803
She is over 14, and I am unfair.

666
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:31,273
Sometimes you have to be.

667
00:53:31,811 --> 00:53:34,302
Besides, do you know
any 14-year-old actresses?

668
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:37,713
You're a real hypocrite!

669
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:41,512
It took you a whole week
to make up your mind.

670
00:53:41,988 --> 00:53:44,354
Not at all.
I was convinced right away.

671
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,293
But I had to persuade the others,
and that was no small feat.

672
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:51,563
- You weren't sure at all.
- I was very sure.

673
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,227
This is the first time I've had sea urchins.

674
00:53:57,837 --> 00:54:01,136
- How do you eat them?
- With a spoon or your fingers.

675
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:04,765
- And some lemon juice?
- No, no lemon juice.

676
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:09,338
What do you think of Juliet?

677
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:11,211
Oh, she's perfect.

678
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:13,580
And so is Romeo.

679
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:17,448
But I don't believe in perfection.
Doesn't interest me.

680
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,956
I have no idea what to do
with that damn play.

681
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:23,419
It's not the best thing
Shakespeare ever wrote.

682
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:30,129
Come with me.
I've got something to show you.

683
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:43,115
I'm keeping nothing
from my old production except this dress.

684
00:54:43,716 --> 00:54:45,047
It's Juliet's.

685
00:54:46,186 --> 00:54:49,280
- Why did you pick me?
- I didn't.

686
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,415
It was fate that brought us together.

687
00:54:52,992 --> 00:54:55,756
I came looking for Quentin,
and I found you instead.

688
00:54:57,597 --> 00:54:59,531
Why not use the other Juliet?

689
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:01,326
The other Juliet-

690
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:07,037
She was killed in a car accident.

691
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:12,104
Four years ago.

692
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,377
Quentin was driving, wasn't he?

693
00:55:15,548 --> 00:55:16,742
Yes.

694
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:19,484
They were 16 when they met.

695
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:21,817
They discovered everything together.

696
00:55:22,288 --> 00:55:24,381
The theater, love, success.

697
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:27,356
Too much success,
too much love.

698
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:30,927
You know...

699
00:55:32,098 --> 00:55:36,034
it's not easy when everything's
handed to you all at once.

700
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,328
You understand?

701
00:55:39,505 --> 00:55:41,837
Nothing more to want,
nothing more to wait for.

702
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:45,510
Nothing more to ask for.

703
00:55:46,746 --> 00:55:48,646
They realized it couldn't last.

704
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:52,348
The only place they could go was down.

705
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,611
So they decided to die together,

706
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:57,255
but Quentin survived.

707
00:55:57,824 --> 00:56:02,454
I'm the guilty party in all this.
I practically forced them to fall in love.

708
00:56:03,663 --> 00:56:05,358
I took advantage of their youth.

709
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:07,556
Maybe it's best not to stir all this up

710
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:09,995
and drop the play.

711
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:12,628
Juliet could be my big chance.

712
00:56:15,108 --> 00:56:16,803
I won't give it up.

713
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:31,653
I'd like to start work right away.

714
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,965
- I've got great news.
- I'm in a hurry.

715
00:56:43,336 --> 00:56:45,236
I got the part of my life.

716
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:47,100
You were out all night.

717
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,901
You've got no business living with me
if that's how it is.

718
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:58,110
You're out of your mind.
It was for work.

719
00:56:58,284 --> 00:56:59,273
For work?

720
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,545
I thought you never got
anywhere in auditions.

721
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:03,882
If you got a part,
you must've done something for it.

722
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:06,582
- You don't really believe I -
- I don't believe anything.

723
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:08,852
You do whatever you want anyway.

724
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:20,435
"My only love sprung from my only hate.

725
00:57:20,873 --> 00:57:23,467
Too early seen unknown,
and known too late.

726
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:28,973
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
that I must love a loathed enemy."

727
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:34,483
Prodigious...

728
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:42,058
"Prodigious birth of love..."

729
00:57:51,904 --> 00:57:54,532
No use screaming.
I won't let you go.

730
00:57:55,908 --> 00:57:57,500
So you're gonna play Juliet.

731
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:00,736
The tea-or-chocolate wench
wants to be a princess, eh?

732
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:02,676
Alas, it's a story about love,

733
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,840
an emotion you're incapable of feeling.

734
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:08,878
You're too shallow to imagine it,
too common to understand it.

735
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:13,281
I know what love is about
because I gave my all for it.

736
00:58:15,795 --> 00:58:17,786
I paid the price with my life.

737
00:58:19,932 --> 00:58:21,559
And so did she.

738
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:23,691
The real Juliet.

739
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,728
The only Juliet.

740
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:31,110
With you, the play'll turn into
a cheap bourgeois farce.

741
00:58:31,277 --> 00:58:34,405
Maybe that's what Scrutzler's after.
You never know with him.

742
00:58:34,981 --> 00:58:38,849
You'll be booed, your name dragged
through the mud, and it'll serve you right.

743
00:58:39,118 --> 00:58:42,781
You'll step over anybody to get
your shabby little name up in lights.

744
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:45,956
You exploit my death,
and what's more, you use her.

745
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,184
She sacrificed everything
for an ideal you can't touch,

746
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:50,226
and you wipe your filthy feet on it!

747
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:52,455
I forbid you to take her place,
you understand?

748
00:58:52,632 --> 00:58:55,362
I forbid you to sully a story
that doesn't belong to you!

749
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:01,432
"My only love sprung from my only hate.

750
00:59:01,941 --> 00:59:04,466
Too early seen unknown,
and known too late.

751
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:10,007
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that I must love a loathed enemy."

752
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,240
This isn't working.

753
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:15,217
This isn't working. I can't get it.

754
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:28,223
I don't get this play at all.

755
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:33,066
Why do they love each other?
Why does she love him?

756
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:35,838
You mustn't ask all these questions.

757
00:59:36,008 --> 00:59:38,476
They're beside the point.
Why do they love each other?

758
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:42,546
Why do people love each other?
Because they're enemies.

759
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:46,317
You're too sentimental.
You've got to act love as if it were hate.

760
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:49,314
I'll pick it up after the kiss,

761
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:52,622
when she says, "Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

762
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:56,724
You can't spend all Sunday on it.
It's after 6:00.

763
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:58,796
But I've got to work on it!

764
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:00,796
I'm fed up.

765
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:04,035
You gave me this part.
I need time.

766
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:08,804
It's your responsibility.

767
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:20,913
It was just the birds
knocking against their cage.

768
01:00:29,028 --> 01:00:31,724
You're spending your life in here.
That's not good.

769
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:35,762
You ought to go out,
have fun, make love.

770
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:37,027
With whom?

771
01:00:39,038 --> 01:00:40,232
I don't know.

772
01:00:41,073 --> 01:00:42,904
You said you lived with someone.

773
01:00:43,075 --> 01:00:44,508
Make love with Paulot?

774
01:00:45,178 --> 01:00:46,873
He's sweet, but that's not enough.

775
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:50,545
Have you ever loved anyone?

776
01:00:51,117 --> 01:00:52,277
Quentin.

777
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,050
You love him because you've lost him.

778
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:05,163
Have you ever loved anyone?

779
01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:09,433
My daughter.

780
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,901
And I lost her.

781
01:01:13,873 --> 01:01:15,500
It was my own fault.

782
01:01:18,377 --> 01:01:19,901
Your fault?

783
01:01:23,282 --> 01:01:24,840
She was Juliet.

784
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:29,280
I've lost her,
and there's nothing I can do.

785
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:33,453
Shall we go?

786
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,040
We have to forget all that.
Let's go enjoy ourselves.

787
01:02:13,332 --> 01:02:15,163
Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here?

788
01:02:15,334 --> 01:02:18,167
Waiting for you.
You always go home the same way.

789
01:02:18,337 --> 01:02:19,998
That raincoat was Quentin's.

790
01:02:20,172 --> 01:02:21,571
Not only that.

791
01:02:22,341 --> 01:02:24,104
This was his too.

792
01:02:24,277 --> 01:02:25,574
You're being ridiculous.

793
01:02:25,745 --> 01:02:29,078
I don't give a damn.
You want to sleep with Nina, don't you?

794
01:02:29,715 --> 01:02:31,342
That's none of your business.

795
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:36,283
She's young and pretty,
and you're old and ugly. It's disgusting!

796
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:40,221
You think she prefers
ignorant little creeps like you?

797
01:02:40,993 --> 01:02:43,393
I love her,
and I'm ready to fight for her!

798
01:02:44,363 --> 01:02:46,388
And you'd easily win.

799
01:02:46,899 --> 01:02:48,833
But would that prove she loves you?

800
01:02:49,402 --> 01:02:52,235
You mustn't ever touch her!
Is that clear?

801
01:02:52,705 --> 01:02:54,229
You needn't be afraid.

802
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:55,931
That'll never happen.

803
01:02:57,143 --> 01:02:59,509
I'm not the one who's afraid.
You are!

804
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,510
You're a pathetic old man!

805
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:04,980
Your position gives you power over her.
Don't take advantage of it!

806
01:03:05,151 --> 01:03:07,449
I never did.
I never slept with Nina.

807
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,645
I love her like only a father can.

808
01:03:11,824 --> 01:03:14,850
Like what? A father?

809
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:19,361
Did you say like a father?

810
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:24,099
You're right to laugh.

811
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:01,571
Paulot, come look.

812
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:05,207
Is this how you see Juliet?

813
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:08,045
- It's not the way I see you.
- Why not?

814
01:04:08,981 --> 01:04:11,677
Why not? Ever since you got this part,
Nina's disappeared.

815
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:13,716
And I don't give a damn about Juliet!

816
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:15,251
Yes, but it's tough going.

817
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:17,321
I'm afraid I might not make it.

818
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:21,724
Oh, I'm not too worried.
You have plenty of aces up your sleeve.

819
01:04:21,894 --> 01:04:24,089
Will you listen to a scene?
I want your opinion.

820
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,695
My opinion?

821
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:29,091
I couldn't care less
whether you play Juliet or not!

822
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:34,534
Look at me for once!
Don't you see I'm packing my bags?

823
01:04:35,241 --> 01:04:37,038
What's the matter, Paulot?

824
01:04:37,209 --> 01:04:39,143
Don't, Paulot. Please.

825
01:04:39,311 --> 01:04:41,871
This little comedy has run its course.
I'm leaving!

826
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:44,344
What have I done?

827
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:45,848
Nothing. Not a damn thing.

828
01:04:46,018 --> 01:04:47,508
I didn't sleep with anybody!

829
01:04:47,686 --> 01:04:51,281
I'm leaving you everything
except the alarm clock.

830
01:04:52,057 --> 01:04:54,525
What's going on?
Are you out of your mind?

831
01:04:54,794 --> 01:04:57,058
So now I'm the one out of my mind?

832
01:04:57,229 --> 01:04:59,163
You know I love you, Paulot.

833
01:04:59,265 --> 01:05:03,292
Nina, you want everyone to love you,
but you're incapable of love yourself.

834
01:05:03,702 --> 01:05:06,034
Love's not something
in some shitty play. It's life.

835
01:05:06,372 --> 01:05:09,068
But you can't see that.
You can't see anything!

836
01:05:19,718 --> 01:05:21,709
You see? You're not frightened
of me anymore.

837
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:25,616
I once told you that
when you became nothing-

838
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:28,025
a speck of dust-
we'd be together again.

839
01:05:29,395 --> 01:05:31,556
Well, the moment has come.

840
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:35,901
You're all alone now.

841
01:05:36,268 --> 01:05:38,099
There's just you and me.

842
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,810
Tell me you won't play Juliet.

843
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,480
I won't play Juliet.

844
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:15,207
You see? I can be tender.

845
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:19,138
Why are you crying?

846
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:21,010
I'm here.

847
01:07:02,555 --> 01:07:04,386
What are you doing here?

848
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:07,725
I'm being interviewed on TV today.

849
01:07:07,826 --> 01:07:09,817
I read the article
where Scrutzler mentioned you.

850
01:07:09,995 --> 01:07:11,326
I'm waiting for him now.

851
01:07:11,497 --> 01:07:13,260
- Fred.
- Cool it, everybody.

852
01:07:13,432 --> 01:07:15,059
Move along. Break it up.

853
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:28,306
I saw a play by Scrutzler four years ago.

854
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,938
Same play, in fact.
Can't accuse the guy of novelty.

855
01:07:32,284 --> 01:07:35,617
But he sure knows actors.
The guy playing Romeo was wonderful.

856
01:07:37,456 --> 01:07:39,947
I showed you the poster at the house.
You remember?

857
01:07:43,662 --> 01:07:45,493
- So you're getting married?
- Yeah.

858
01:07:45,598 --> 01:07:47,998
Seems incredible.
I never thought it would happen.

859
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,727
But Daisy's the real thing.

860
01:07:49,902 --> 01:07:52,530
Naturally nothing's ready, as usual!
That's France for you.

861
01:07:55,507 --> 01:07:57,338
- You got an apple, sweetheart?
- Sure.

862
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,743
Here.

863
01:08:00,312 --> 01:08:01,939
Daisy, this is Nina.

864
01:08:02,848 --> 01:08:04,679
I met her a couple years ago.

865
01:08:05,618 --> 01:08:07,176
Anne Larrieu? Is that you?

866
01:08:07,353 --> 01:08:09,344
Mr. Scrutzler just called.
He's not coming.

867
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:11,216
We're calling off the interview.
I'm sorry.

868
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:14,484
What? You make this actress
come all this way and then you cancel?

869
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,423
- Who cares about your Mr. -
- Scrutzler.

870
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:19,223
Right. It's her face
they're coming to see.

871
01:08:19,398 --> 01:08:22,663
- He canceled, not me.
- Wait a minute.

872
01:08:24,436 --> 01:08:26,495
Don't worry. Daisy'll fix it up.

873
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:32,267
You still living with what's-his-name?
The guy who rents apartments.

874
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:35,002
He took off.
I haven't seen him in a week.

875
01:08:36,782 --> 01:08:38,306
He was a real dim bulb.

876
01:09:01,674 --> 01:09:02,868
No, 8:00's impossible.

877
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:05,173
Hold on. 10:00 is out too.

878
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:07,742
Is noon all right for you?

879
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:11,073
Good. We'll meet at the apartment
at noon tomorrow.

880
01:09:12,551 --> 01:09:13,813
Very good.

881
01:09:13,986 --> 01:09:15,453
Good night.

882
01:09:16,822 --> 01:09:19,450
Nice work, Paulot.
You're back on top of things.

883
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:22,994
Since you moved to the hotel,
you're your old self again.

884
01:09:23,562 --> 01:09:26,929
- It was crazy to live with that girl.
- Don't mention her.

885
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:39,772
I never told you before,
but you had me worried for my business.

886
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:43,146
She wasn't the girl for me anyway.

887
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:46,142
It's a big world.
I'll find someone else.

888
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:49,116
You're wrong, Paulot.
It's a very small world.

889
01:09:49,555 --> 01:09:50,749
Good night.

890
01:09:57,196 --> 01:09:59,596
- Good evening.
- Well, well. Hello, Nina.

891
01:09:59,765 --> 01:10:02,734
Forgive me for running off,
but my hairdresser won't wait.

892
01:10:09,608 --> 01:10:12,600
Paulot, remember to set
the burglar alarm this time.

893
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:28,451
You all right?

894
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,092
Yeah. And you?

895
01:10:43,008 --> 01:10:45,169
You know, working hard.

896
01:10:47,312 --> 01:10:49,473
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

897
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:52,381
Nothing.
Going back to the hotel.

898
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:54,949
Isn't that place depressing?

899
01:10:55,687 --> 01:10:57,518
Less than your place was.

900
01:10:58,624 --> 01:11:02,788
Anyway, I found something interesting.

901
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:04,922
A studio.

902
01:11:05,864 --> 01:11:07,729
3,000 francs a month.

903
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:10,498
Look. I've got pictures.

904
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,001
Tell me what you think.

905
01:11:14,339 --> 01:11:15,772
Not bad, huh?

906
01:11:16,642 --> 01:11:19,440
You can't see a thing.
How would you know?

907
01:11:20,078 --> 01:11:22,239
Don't burn up my apartment, okay?

908
01:11:24,249 --> 01:11:26,080
So you smoke now.

909
01:11:27,085 --> 01:11:28,552
You look tired.

910
01:12:20,806 --> 01:12:24,242
Fuck me, fuck me.

911
01:12:29,514 --> 01:12:30,879
Fuck me!

912
01:14:43,949 --> 01:14:45,814
How's Juliet coming?

913
01:14:45,984 --> 01:14:47,918
I thought you didn't
want to talk about it.

914
01:14:48,553 --> 01:14:50,680
It doesn't matter anymore.

915
01:14:54,493 --> 01:14:56,324
Well, I'll see you.

916
01:14:56,628 --> 01:14:58,528
We can't just say good-bye like this.

917
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:01,632
I mean, we could go have a drink.

918
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:05,496
All right. If you'd like.

919
01:15:17,215 --> 01:15:18,876
You hardly ate a thing.

920
01:15:22,287 --> 01:15:24,721
I've been a bit of a wreck since you left.

921
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:29,426
It's because you work too hard.

922
01:15:29,728 --> 01:15:31,355
No, it's not that.

923
01:15:32,097 --> 01:15:34,861
The play opens tomorrow night,
but it's not that.

924
01:15:39,104 --> 01:15:40,935
It's after 3:00, and they're closing.

925
01:15:41,106 --> 01:15:43,666
Don't you think it's time
you went home to bed?

926
01:15:46,845 --> 01:15:48,574
I'm not tired.

927
01:15:49,848 --> 01:15:52,840
Want to come for a walk with me,
like that first night?

928
01:15:55,153 --> 01:15:56,711
The first night?

929
01:15:57,456 --> 01:15:59,356
That was a long time ago.

930
01:16:21,513 --> 01:16:23,378
You're awfully quiet.
You haven't said a word.

931
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:27,084
You wanted to walk,
so that's what we did - all night long.

932
01:16:27,452 --> 01:16:30,387
I've just got time
to take a shower before work.

933
01:16:31,123 --> 01:16:32,385
So...

934
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:34,657
anyway...

935
01:16:35,627 --> 01:16:37,993
I've got my fingers crossed for you.

936
01:16:39,531 --> 01:16:41,362
I'd like you to be there tonight.

937
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,370
I brought you two tickets.

938
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,632
For tonight.

939
01:17:41,326 --> 01:17:44,227
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

940
01:17:46,064 --> 01:17:47,895
- Where is he?
- In the bar.

941
01:17:50,535 --> 01:17:53,402
Watch me from out front.
You won't see a thing back here.

942
01:17:53,572 --> 01:17:55,563
I see better with my eyes shut.

943
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,607
- How will I know if it's going all right?
- It will or it won't.

944
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:15,823
- I can't breathe!
- Take a deep breath.

945
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:17,427
You're fine. It's stage fright.

946
01:18:20,865 --> 01:18:22,833
Calm down. Come on.

947
01:18:24,002 --> 01:18:27,199
Take a deep breath.
Breathe in slowly.

948
01:18:34,746 --> 01:18:37,442
It's Quentin who's doing this.

949
01:18:37,749 --> 01:18:40,912
- He doesn't want me to play Juliet.
- Quentin is gone!

950
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:42,743
You're on your own!

951
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:45,416
- I can feel him here.
- Quentin is dead.

952
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:47,888
He's here.

953
01:18:49,461 --> 01:18:51,224
He's stopping me from -

954
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,263
I'm going to die.

955
01:18:53,431 --> 01:18:55,661
You won't die.
You'll give this part all you've got

956
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:56,596
I'm going to die.

957
01:18:56,768 --> 01:18:58,736
You'll give it all you've got.

958
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:01,729
Or perhaps you'll lose your nerve.

959
01:19:01,906 --> 01:19:03,874
Either way,
it has nothing to do with Quentin.

960
01:19:05,944 --> 01:19:08,310
There've been thousands
of Juliets before you,

961
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:10,274
and there'll be thousands more.

962
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,245
Call it off if you want.

963
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,317
It's your decision.

964
01:19:20,492 --> 01:19:21,891
It's up to you.

965
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:24,588
I'm done here.

966
01:19:27,265 --> 01:19:28,926
Where are you going?

967
01:19:29,267 --> 01:19:33,169
Places for Act 1, Scene 1.

968
01:19:34,372 --> 01:19:36,067
I'm going back to London.

969
01:19:39,577 --> 01:19:41,204
What are you doing?

970
01:19:41,379 --> 01:19:43,643
I have a taxi waiting.
I fulfilled my contract.

971
01:19:47,018 --> 01:19:48,849
You can't do this!

972
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,920
Everything will be fine, madam.

973
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,485
Now it can start.

974
01:20:20,352 --> 01:20:22,081
Would you mind turning up the heat?

975
01:20:22,253 --> 01:20:24,084
It's already on high.

976
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:28,187
Shall I turn on the radio?

977
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,155
No, no music.

978
01:21:26,351 --> 01:21:29,980
"Except a grain of wheat fall into
the ground and die, it remains only a single seed.

979
01:21:30,155 --> 01:21:33,181
But if it die,
it bringeth forth much fruit."

980
01:21:33,358 --> 01:21:35,292
John 12:24, 25
