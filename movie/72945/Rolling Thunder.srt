1
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:47,836
Major, I sure do hate to
face all them people.

2
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:52,090
Then put your glasses on, John.

3
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,475
- Welcome home, Major Rane.
- Good to be back.

4
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,643
Meet Mrs. Murphy.

5
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:27,878
Hello, Mrs. Murphy,
nice to meet you.

6
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,271
Meet Colonel Burlingame.

7
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:31,273
Welcome home, meet
Mrs. Burlingame.

8
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,024
- Thank you.
- Welcome home.

9
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,736
- Meet Colonel Maxwell.
- Welcome home, Major.

10
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,156
Major McConnell, sir.

11
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,158
- Welcome home.
- Good to meet you.

12
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,022
Major Rane, I'm sure
the crowd would

13
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:44,703
like to hear you say a few words.

14
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,793
Good to be back.

15
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:54,296
We knew all along

16
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,757
that everyone back home
from the President on down,

17
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:59,301
was behind us 100 percent.

18
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:02,512
It was God and faith in our
families that kept us going.

19
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,222
Speaking for myself,

20
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:08,059
I'd like to say that the whole
experience has made a better man,

21
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:10,771
a better officer, and a
better American out of me.

22
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:12,981
Thank you very much.

23
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:19,654
Very well done, very well done,
I wish you a lot of luck.

24
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:20,697
Thank you, sir.

25
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:23,325
Major, Mrs. Rane and your son
are right over this way.

26
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,168
Good to see you, Charley.

27
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,591
Hi, Daddy.

28
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:41,676
- Hello, Son, how are you?
- Fine.

29
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,310
Oh, honey, oh.

30
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,854
Oh, baby, it's so
good having you back.

31
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,231
Look who all came to see you.

32
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,398
There's your dad.

33
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,651
Oh, God, we've been looking
forward to this day.

34
00:05:58,235 --> 00:05:59,861
Doesn't he look great?

35
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,072
Yeah, oh, I'm so glad you're home.

36
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:03,607
- Aw, welcome home.
- Look at his patches, Pa.

37
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,116
- Hello, boy.
- Hi, Daddy.

38
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,952
- Doesn't he look good?
- Glad my boy's home.

39
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:08,245
Glad to see you, Son.

40
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,039
Major Rane, how do feel about
being back after seven years?

41
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:12,783
No questions right now, if
you don't mind, please.

42
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:14,146
Major do you feel any
bitterness toward

43
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:15,428
the people in the
anti-war movement?

44
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,248
I don't think this is time
for that, if you don't mind.

45
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,250
Gentlemen, please...

46
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,802
Is it true that you were
starved and tortured?

47
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:22,091
Colonel Maxwell,
can you comment...

48
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:30,976
Charley, I was so nervous that,

49
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,103
Cliff came by to drive us out.

50
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:34,729
You remember Cliff?

51
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,775
- How ya doing, Cliff?
- Real good, Charley.

52
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,985
God damn, it's good to see you.

53
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,025
Good to see you too again.

54
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,254
Jesus Christ, you're looking good.

55
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:43,680
Hey, let's get you
outta here, okay?

56
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:47,909
Oh, excuse me.

57
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:49,619
Hey, runt, not over there.

58
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:50,854
Come on, get in back
with your daddy.

59
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,123
Come on, runt, let's move it.

60
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,541
Come on.

61
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,050
Major.

62
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,635
We'll, we made it, John.

63
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:07,971
We're home.

64
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:11,182
Take care of yourself,
now, you're gonna be fine.

65
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,559
Oh, yeah.

66
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,647
You ever get out to
El Paso, Major...

67
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:19,900
Hey, I'll be there.

68
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,070
Take care.

69
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,429
Aren't you glad your daddy's home?

70
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:50,931
Sure.

71
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,974
Remember what Dr. Maxwell said.

72
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,109
It'll take a little while for you
two to get to know each other,

73
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,519
but you will.

74
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:58,229
Why is he staying out
in the work shed?

75
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,107
Just because it's small
and quiet out there.

76
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,071
Charley, come in.

77
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,412
Hi.

78
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,627
That's a real pretty shotgun you
got me for a present, thank you.

79
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:23,672
Cliff took me down to his special
police gun store to get it.

80
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,131
He helped me pick it out.

81
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:27,175
Says it's as good as they come.

82
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,972
Sleep tight.

83
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,523
Well, that was real nice of Cliff.

84
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:42,999
Maybe you and I can
go out and take

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,359
a little target practise with it.

86
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:45,860
- What do you say?
- Okay.

87
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:47,404
We'll do it.

88
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,738
Why don't you get some sleep

89
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:50,699
and I'll talk to you
in the morning, huh?

90
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,912
Where'd you find that?

91
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:57,455
In the living room.

92
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,999
Mum said it was yours.

93
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:02,377
It's all right, I just
didn't know you had it.

94
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,507
I carried that around
with me for a long time.

95
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,634
See, where I was,

96
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:12,053
we didn't get to see the
American flag very often.

97
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:14,139
In jail?

98
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:17,642
Jail, well, I guess so, yeah.

99
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,395
I made that myself.

100
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:23,648
I'd collect little pieces
of thread and cloth and,

101
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,776
well, it took a long time.

102
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,111
But I made it.

103
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,280
Every morning

104
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,866
all the men in my compound
would come in and salute it.

105
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:35,326
That little thing?

106
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:37,245
Yeah, that little thing.

107
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,998
Sometimes we'd even whisper
the "Star Spangled Banner."

108
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,545
Do you remember me?

109
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,757
I mean, what I looked
like when I was a baby?

110
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,469
Sure, of course I do.

111
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,472
Every last detail.

112
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,977
Why don't you take that
as a present from me?

113
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:02,312
Thanks.

114
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,191
You don't remember me, do you?

115
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,903
Well, there's no
reason why you should.

116
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,573
When I left, you were
only about that big.

117
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,159
About 18 months old.

118
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,830
But you knew your
daddy then, Mark.

119
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:22,082
You knew me.

120
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:26,294
Last thing I remember,

121
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,588
just before I was getting on
the plane to go overseas,

122
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:33,593
was your little legs toddling up
toward me saying, "Daddy, Daddy."

123
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,429
You were some tough little guy.

124
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:40,558
Now, why don't you
get some sleep, Son?

125
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,727
Good night, Daddy.

126
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,657
Did you leave the night-light on?

127
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,117
Can't sleep without it.

128
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,997
Seems a little confused.

129
00:11:03,032 --> 00:11:05,125
Yeah, he's been
that way for weeks.

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,003
Had a 104 degree fever
for three days...

131
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:10,880
vomiting and diarrhoea.

132
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:21,141
Dr. Maxwell says it's
nothing organic.

133
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,392
It's just nerves, that's all.

134
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:24,811
A problem that POW families have.

135
00:11:24,846 --> 00:11:26,437
Among others.

136
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:39,617
You didn't change the
house much, did you?

137
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,829
Didn't change a thing.

138
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:45,206
You had all that back pay.

139
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:46,624
I didn't touch a penny of it.

140
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,211
As soon as I found out
you were alive...

141
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:52,338
Alive?

142
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:56,718
Well, in the prison camp,

143
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:57,886
whatever you call it.

144
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,561
Anyway, I was working.

145
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:11,316
I decided just to leave it in the
bank for you to do wanted with it.

146
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,067
That's real nice to hear.

147
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:16,154
I got you a present.

148
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:17,572
A special one.

149
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,577
I hope you remember.

150
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,180
Mounds, huh?

151
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:43,723
Yeah.

152
00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:46,893
Remember how you used to eat 'em
when we first went together?

153
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:48,937
I told you that your teeth
were gonna fall out.

154
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:52,482
I had one of those in my flight
jacket the day I went down.

155
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,360
I tried to save it.

156
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,280
I took a little bite out of
it every day for six months.

157
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:02,742
Oh, Charley.

158
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,666
You've changed your hair.

159
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:13,419
Yeah, about a hundred times
in the last three weeks.

160
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:16,673
And you're not
wearing a brassiere.

161
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,550
Nobody wears 'em anymore.

162
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:20,760
Didn't they tell you that?

163
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,846
No.

164
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:25,515
They told us about miniskirts,

165
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,059
but, I never thought
we'd get to see one.

166
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:30,103
Well I have one, you
want me to try it on?

167
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,648
No.

168
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:35,108
You don't have to do that.

169
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:40,780
Charley,

170
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,324
I've...

171
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,412
I've been with another man.

172
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:57,839
Well, aren't you
gonna say anything?

173
00:13:57,874 --> 00:13:59,048
Just gonna sit there?

174
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:04,137
Oh, Charley, I didn't know

175
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:06,264
when you were coming back
or if you ever would.

176
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:12,270
I'll tell ya, the men around
here don't respect anything.

177
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,564
If I told you all the
guys that called me up.

178
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,525
A lot of your friends from the
base, I didn't even look at 'em.

179
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,278
And then, Cliff.

180
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:26,576
He and Peggy split and,

181
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:28,661
she took the kids to California.

182
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,665
And Cliff started coming
over, playing with Mark

183
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,336
and fixing things up
around the house.

184
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,255
He didn't make a pass at me.

185
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,467
I mean, he didn't even
do it at all, Charley.

186
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:44,469
I knew what he wanted but...

187
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,764
he never did anything about it.

188
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,561
And then it just seemed like
the two of us just had to.

189
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,149
I knew, we all knew.

190
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,443
Couldn't a been any other way.

191
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,619
Cliff asked me to
marry him, Charley.

192
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:13,247
And I said I would.

193
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,420
I don't think I'm up
for any more of this.

194
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,174
Why don't you go to bed?

195
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,303
We'll work this all out.

196
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,138
What are you going to do?

197
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,682
I'm just gonna sit here.

198
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,459
I can't sleep.

199
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,837
Those pills you gave
me don't work anymore.

200
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,884
Well, after seven years,

201
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,969
it's gonna take some
time to readjust.

202
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,388
I had everything worked out.

203
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:54,474
But nothing's going
the way I planned.

204
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,771
My wife wants a divorce, but I
suppose you already knew that.

205
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,151
Does that make you angry?

206
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,825
It's important to me

207
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,578
that I stay close to my son.

208
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:17,163
I won't let him go.

209
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:19,790
You won't have to.

210
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:28,591
Now, no matter what happens,

211
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:30,426
I won't let him go.

212
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:02,708
All right folks, keep it quiet.

213
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:07,838
Major Rane, to help you travel
on the road to success in style,

214
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:09,632
Rogers Motors is proud
to present to you

215
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,926
the keys to that
Cadillac convertible.

216
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:14,011
Thank you very much.

217
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:27,650
And as a special presentation,
the young Texas belle

218
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:30,486
who wore your VIVA bracelet
all the while you were away,

219
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:31,737
Miss Linda Forchet... Linda.

220
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,042
Maim',

221
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,670
I've been looking
forward to the clay

222
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,255
that I'd be giving
this back to you.

223
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,676
Thank you very much.

224
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,266
And Green's Department Store
would like to present you

225
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:01,809
with a token of our respect,

226
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:05,730
admiration, and hope
for the future...

227
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:09,317
One silver dollar for every day
you were in Hanoi's hell hole.

228
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:13,237
That amounts to a grand
total of $2,555.00.

229
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,949
Oh, and one for good luck.

230
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,538
Thank you very much.

231
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,295
What are you gonna do with
all those silver dollars?

232
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,798
Oh, I guess I'll take
'em home and hide 'em.

233
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,772
You should try talking
to Charley about it.

234
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,483
What should I tell him?

235
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:54,195
I'm sorry they shot you
down and tortured you?

236
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,530
Sorry I'm taking your
family away from you?

237
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,701
I sure didn't want it
to work out like this.

238
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,833
I didn't either.

239
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:08,959
Hey.

240
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,838
Hey.

241
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:16,634
Hey, come on.

242
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:19,679
Come on, it's gonna be all right.

243
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,307
I'll try talking to him.

244
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,145
Cliff, I feel so guilty.

245
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,990
Come on, runt, chuck it over here.

246
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,828
Now over to your daddy.

247
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,121
No, No, no, no.

248
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,833
You guys go ahead, I'm beat.

249
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,099
Buy you a drink?

250
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:06,726
Sure.

251
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,569
If I'm bothering you, man,
just tell me to leave.

252
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,196
No, that's all right.

253
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,828
I mean, hell, I wouldn't blame you

254
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:28,205
if you came after me with a
damn tire iron or something.

255
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,816
Now, why would I want to
do something like that?

256
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,503
After everything that's happened.

257
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,262
Hell, what kind of
a man would I be

258
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:45,181
if I went and hid some place
without talking about it.

259
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,856
Welcome home, Charley.

260
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:58,527
It's good to be home, Cliff.

261
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,491
I gotta say this, Charley,

262
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,826
I really admire you.

263
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,745
Well, thank you, Cliff.

264
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:11,165
I mean, I've been in some
scrapes, I know what I can do.

265
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,541
But,

266
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,711
well, anyone who wasn't over
there has to ask himself

267
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:18,088
if he coulda taken it.

268
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:20,508
You know, getting
tortured and all.

269
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,844
I mean, them gooks had no mercy.

270
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,432
Well, you don't want to
hear about that, Cliff.

271
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,435
No, no way.

272
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,188
I don't even want
to think about it.

273
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:36,857
You know, you're lucky.

274
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:39,151
You're lucky they didn't
ruin you for life.

275
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,864
You want to know what they did?

276
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,658
No.

277
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,868
Sure you do.

278
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:52,122
I'll show you... See, they
had this little rope trick.

279
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:53,165
Yeah?

280
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,960
Yeah, they were...
kinda happy with it.

281
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,545
What they did was, see,
was they got you down

282
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,171
on your knees in
front of 'em, see.

283
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,673
- Huh.
- Like this.

284
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,469
And then they tied your
arms behind you, see, here.

285
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:06,698
Here, help me out, give me a hand.

286
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:07,699
Huh?

287
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,391
Just help me out, tie that
arm to this one real close.

288
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:11,559
Okay.

289
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,771
- Like this?
- That's right.

290
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:16,897
Huh.

291
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:19,024
Tighter, man, they did it tighter.

292
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,359
All right.

293
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:23,028
You, sure you want to go through
this again, huh, Charley?

294
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:24,947
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

295
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,907
Go ahead, now you take
in the loose ends.

296
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:27,950
All right.

297
00:23:27,985 --> 00:23:29,519
And you pull it up in the
air like you're gonna

298
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,786
take me clear on
up to the ceiling.

299
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:32,037
All right, like this?

300
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:33,330
That's it.

301
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,335
Now, higher, man, higher, 'til you
hear the bones starting to crack.

302
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,170
- That's it.
- Higher.

303
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,302
Pull on it, higher. Higher.

304
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,430
Yeah, all right,
Charley, that's enough.

305
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:04,028
They used to do that
to us twice a clay.

306
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,865
I don't know how you took it.

307
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:14,038
You learn to love the rope.

308
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,624
That's how you beat 'em.

309
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,255
That's how you beat
people who torture you.

310
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,090
You learn to love 'em.

311
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,717
And they don't know
you're beating 'em.

312
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,351
Listen, Cliff...

313
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,271
I hope you don't mind
me saying this to you.

314
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:44,318
But I'd really appreciate it if
you didn't call my kid a runt.

315
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,737
I won't.

316
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,365
Sorry, Charley.

317
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,369
Here's looking at you.

318
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:14,848
How ya doing fella,
what can I do for ya?

319
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:17,977
Oh, how about giving me ten
dollars worth a premium.

320
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:20,396
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

321
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,377
Major Rane?

322
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,046
Hi.

323
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:48,632
Hi.

324
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:53,387
Linda Forchet, the girl
who wore your bracelet.

325
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:55,806
Oh, yeah, I remember. How are you?

326
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:57,391
Fine.

327
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,352
I like your shirt.

328
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:01,603
You been shopping?

329
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:02,813
Yeah.

330
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,688
How about... come
on, I'll buy you a

331
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,026
drink to your new wardrobe, okay?

332
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:08,485
No, I gotta be getting back.

333
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,779
Hey, you gonna be the first
guy to say no to me?

334
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,409
- Come on.
- I guess not.

335
00:26:15,444 --> 00:26:17,911
Why don't you hop in
and I'll park the car.

336
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,719
I work here at night.

337
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,096
What are you doing here now?

338
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,432
Just hanging out.

339
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,100
I come in and I water the plants.

340
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:43,854
And socialise.

341
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:49,610
Bebe, bring me a Tom Collins.

342
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:51,779
Major, what are you drinking?

343
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,114
I'll have a tap beer.

344
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,617
You Major Charles Rane?

345
00:26:56,652 --> 00:26:57,993
Yes, mam.

346
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,205
Bebe, the man's thirsty.

347
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,165
Oh, well, you sure shouldn't be.

348
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,755
Pay no attention to
the village idiot.

349
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:18,097
I been hoping to run
into you like this.

350
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,811
Would you believe that I was
gonna slip you my number

351
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:26,480
that day that they gave you
those dumb silver dollars?

352
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,776
You being married and all,
I just like, "Whoa, baby,

353
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,194
get a hold of yourself."

354
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,824
Thank you.

355
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,618
This round's on Eddie, Major.

356
00:27:39,653 --> 00:27:41,411
The bartender.

357
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:43,205
Oh, would you thank
him for me, please.

358
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,793
Well, happy days.

359
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,337
Here's looking at you.

360
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,720
Here's looking at you.

361
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,976
You're the strong,
silent type, aren't you?

362
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,229
No, I'm just a little
rusty on my small talk.

363
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:09,439
Hey, I didn't mean anything bad.

364
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,985
I don't mind carrying the ball.

365
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,612
Shoot, it's a pleasure
after all the fat,

366
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:17,156
maudlin drunks I
have to put up with.

367
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,826
Well, I gotta be
getting back anyway.

368
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,538
You know, I'd like you to
thank your friends for me.

369
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:25,914
That was really nice.

370
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:28,750
And I'd like to thank you too

371
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:30,377
for wearing my bracelet
all that time.

372
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,879
I really appreciate that.

373
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,549
It's the very least I could do.

374
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,593
I'd like to do more.

375
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,598
Yeah, well...

376
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:47,227
Well, come back and
see me now, okay?

377
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,021
Wednesday through Sunday night.

378
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,025
Sure, I'll be glad to.

379
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,445
Bye.

380
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:57,905
Bye.

381
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,924
Come on in, Major and have a seat.

382
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:46,930
Hello, Major.

383
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:50,726
Saw you on TV, you looked good.

384
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,060
You really did, you looked good.

385
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:57,983
We also saw 'em give you a whole
shitload full a silver dollars.

386
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,569
And me and the boys, we
were in the neighbourhood

387
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:02,612
and we thought maybe
you should give us

388
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:04,281
some a them silver dollars.

389
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,131
Now, if you'll just be so kind as

390
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:12,247
to tell us where
all that money is,

391
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:15,000
then we can just be on our way.

392
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:17,961
No fuss, no muss.

393
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:28,930
Ain't gonna do it.

394
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,518
Well, these are mean old boys.

395
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,730
They can make you tell
me where the money is.

396
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,324
Melio.

397
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,987
I didn't hear you, boy.

398
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,744
Now, you are gonna tell us where
that money is sooner or later.

399
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,747
I would suggest sooner...

400
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,376
because later may be too late.

401
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,759
He ain't cooperating worth a shit.

402
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,511
Slim.

403
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,516
Get him up, Melio.

404
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:00,814
Now, don't give me any of
that officer hard shit.

405
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,819
Because I was right there
in Nam with rest of you.

406
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:07,362
Except I was laying
face down in the mud

407
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:09,114
while you cats was flying over.

408
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:10,532
Come on.

409
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:13,827
Now, whatta you got to say?

410
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:19,916
Rane... Major Charles W.

411
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:22,919
396-84-69.

412
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:32,554
He's a rough old boy, ain't he?

413
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,640
This dude's crazy.

414
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,809
He ain't gonna do too well in
the information department.

415
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,441
God damn you.

416
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,529
I'll make this motherfucker
talk, fetch him.

417
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,074
You ready to talk to us now, boy?

418
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,868
I don't think we gonna
get them silver dollars.

419
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,954
Oh, shit, Slim, we'll
get 'em, we'll get 'em.

420
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,080
Chief, la Puerta.

421
00:34:40,115 --> 00:34:41,115
Well, get it.

422
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:43,667
- Come on.
- Charley?

423
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:45,335
Who are you?

424
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,629
Charley?

425
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:48,664
Shut up.

426
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:50,507
Oh, my God.

427
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,509
Lady, your husband...

428
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,436
He's got a whole bag
a silver dollars

429
00:34:55,437 --> 00:34:57,055
and he's got 'em hid from me.

430
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,974
Now, I want them silver dollars.

431
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:01,059
And if I don't get
'em, he's gonna die.

432
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:02,644
No, don't hurt him.

433
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,981
No don't, please don't.

434
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,315
I know where he hid 'em.

435
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,608
Show me, come on.

436
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:14,239
You dumb asshole.

437
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,616
How does it feel to have gone
through all this shit for nothing?

438
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,410
You could have saved
yourself a lot of grief.

439
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,333
Oh, now, Slim, you know a hero,
he don't work like that.

440
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:29,087
Charley, why didn't you tell him?

441
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,592
I'll tell you why, lady...

442
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,347
Because he's one
macho motherfucker.

443
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:45,145
Slim, you and T Bird,
you take the wagon

444
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,023
and Melio and I will meet
you in Nuevo Laredo.

445
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,733
- Fat Ed's?
- Yeah.

446
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:50,984
Melio.

447
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,905
They're cutting new
orders for me, Major.

448
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,285
I wasn't gonna re-up, but
I figure with cupe time

449
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,663
got me ten years and if
I hang in another ten,

450
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:28,581
I'll get me a pension.

451
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,542
Well, you should stay in, John.

452
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:32,377
All you have to do is
collect your check.

453
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:36,089
Hell, what am I gonna do
when them ten years are up?

454
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:39,092
I guess you re-up for another ten.

455
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:40,779
After all, they ain't
gonna dig no oil

456
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,262
wells in your back yard, are they?

457
00:37:42,297 --> 00:37:43,471
Hell, no.

458
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:47,267
I guess one jerk-off job's
good as another one is.

459
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:55,692
How's your wife?

460
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,403
Real good.

461
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,325
Oh, it's hard getting
used to home life again.

462
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,369
You know, getting used
to being with a woman.

463
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,005
You wanna head back?

464
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,759
Yeah, sure, might as well.

465
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,747
Thank you, John.

466
00:38:58,922 --> 00:38:59,964
Pretty slick, ain't it?

467
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:01,508
Oh, yeah.

468
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:05,011
Figure out how to work it yet?

469
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,765
And I've been practising too.

470
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,725
You ought to get the
hang of it pretty soon.

471
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,147
They'll catch them son of a
bitches, Major, they'll catch 'em.

472
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,024
I suppose.

473
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:22,695
Can't just let it slide, Major,
they don't have any right to live.

474
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,240
Hi.

475
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,201
Hey, listen, I can
come back later.

476
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,245
Oh, no, that's all
right, come on in.

477
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,412
Sit down.

478
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:34,374
Linda Forchet, this
here is John Vohden.

479
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,625
We were together.

480
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,587
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

481
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,011
Well, I guess I better
get going, Major,

482
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:48,972
I gotta long drive
back to El Paso.

483
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:50,515
We'll see you.

484
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,016
Yeah, John.

485
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:53,726
Thanks for coming.

486
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:55,311
I'll see you real soon.

487
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,358
- Bye, Miss.
- Bye.

488
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,659
- Bye, Major.
- Take care, John.

489
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,038
I'm gonna put these in some water.

490
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,133
You trying to tell me you ain't
got anything better to do?

491
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:28,412
Oh, sure, my life
is just a mad world

492
00:40:28,413 --> 00:40:30,471
of parties and rich boyfriends.

493
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,974
It wouldn't make any
difference what I was doing.

494
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:34,309
I'd still wanna come see you.

495
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,186
Why?

496
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:42,066
Got yourself a groupie, Major.

497
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,402
What's a groupie?

498
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,362
That word's a little
after my time.

499
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:51,200
Well, a groupie is a girl who
falls in love with a rock star

500
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:52,869
or a movie star.

501
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:54,871
Somebody she didn't know.

502
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:56,748
Worships him and...

503
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,667
knows she's never gonna meet him.

504
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:01,169
But...

505
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,547
if she ever does, she'll
do anything for him.

506
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,557
Anything she can.

507
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,021
It's been six weeks.

508
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,358
And we're getting nowhere.

509
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,197
Wish you could
remember something...

510
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:34,243
A name, a face, an
accent, anything.

511
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:36,663
I can't.

512
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:38,748
You sure about that, Charley?

513
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,839
I can't even remember
how this happened.

514
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:48,967
I know.

515
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:50,843
Sorry.

516
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,642
I just came from the cemetery.

517
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,144
Took some flowers.

518
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:02,939
Graves look real nice.

519
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:06,901
Oh, God.

520
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,822
I wanna get my hands on
them murdering bastards.

521
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:13,950
Well, that'll pass, Cliff.

522
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,745
Everything passes.

523
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:50,153
X-ray technician, please
call the emergency room.

524
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:52,405
X-ray technician, call...

525
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,365
- Just, sign your...
- Hello, Major.

526
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,117
Yeah, I wanna sign the
Major in, please.

527
00:42:56,152 --> 00:42:57,368
Okay.

528
00:42:57,403 --> 00:42:59,954
- How are you today?
- Fine, how are you?

529
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:01,164
Taking Major home?

530
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,249
- That's right.
- Good.

531
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:05,460
- You take good care.
- I will.

532
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:08,963
IV Nurse to Four West, stat.

533
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:12,175
- Okay, that'll be fine.
- Okay, thank you, take care.

534
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,968
- You all set?
- Yeah.

535
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:15,636
Goodbye, Major.

536
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,779
Sure you wouldn't rather
stay at a hotel now?

537
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:34,614
I'm sure.

538
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:39,535
I'll pick you up Monday morning
at about, 10 o'clock, okay?

539
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,370
That's fine.

540
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,752
You know, I really do think
I can help you, Charley.

541
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,588
Well, I'm sure you can, Doc.

542
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:52,799
I think we give it our best
shot on Monday morning.

543
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:02,558
Why don't you just, pull over
and let me out by the mailbox.

544
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:08,815
See you Monday morning then, huh?

545
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,066
You need some help with this bag?

546
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:11,359
No, I can get it, thank you.

547
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:30,790
How ya doing?

548
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:35,753
Well, I was just starting to get
mad at you for not calling.

549
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:38,464
Hey, listen, I'm gonna go on down
to Mexico for a couple of clays.

550
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:40,591
- You wanna come with me?
- When you leaving?

551
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:41,926
Now.

552
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:46,472
I get off at two, why don't you
stick around and have a drink?

553
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:50,226
I gotta go now.

554
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:53,312
What do you expect me to
do, just drop everything?

555
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:05,783
Wednesday was always a slow night.

556
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:12,456
Where we going?

557
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:15,626
Well, we're gonna head
down toward Nuevo Laredo.

558
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:18,254
What's there?

559
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,299
Some people I used to know.

560
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,509
What are we gonna do?

561
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:25,553
Be sociable.

562
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:33,019
Okay, I'm ready.

563
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:03,526
Okay, so what do you want
me to do, ask for Fat Ed?

564
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:04,561
That's right.

565
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,946
I wish you'd come
in there with me.

566
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:08,531
I'm gonna come in
right behind you.

567
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:09,573
I'm gonna surprise him.

568
00:49:39,353 --> 00:49:41,355
Do you know a guy named Fat Ed?

569
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,606
No Understand.

570
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:54,827
I'm looking for a
guy named Fat Ed.

571
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:57,746
Fat Ed, I don't know
anybody by that name.

572
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:06,881
Fat Ed?

573
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,633
I know Fat Ed.

574
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:11,177
He's a good friend of mine.

575
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:15,973
You want to talk to him?

576
00:50:16,008 --> 00:50:18,559
Yeah, he's a friend of a friend.

577
00:50:19,393 --> 00:50:21,228
You want to talk to Fat Ed?

578
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,691
I will take you to him.

579
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:26,726
Follow me.

580
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,331
I'm Lopez.

581
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:43,417
Why do you want to see Fat Ed?

582
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:46,462
I told you, now where is he?

583
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:47,838
He'll be here.

584
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:52,968
Fat Ed likes beautiful
gringo girls.

585
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:55,137
I like beautiful gringo girls.

586
00:50:55,172 --> 00:50:58,098
Everybody likes
beautiful gringo girls.

587
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,228
Fat Ed, he always takes
care of his friends.

588
00:51:02,263 --> 00:51:03,771
What do you mean?

589
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:04,855
We share.

590
00:51:05,189 --> 00:51:08,317
It's okay. It's okay.

591
00:51:08,352 --> 00:51:10,528
- Mister...
- It's okay.

592
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:12,029
You've got the wrong idea.

593
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:13,656
Oh, no, I don't think so.

594
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:14,865
- It's...
- Well, I do.

595
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,992
It's okay, it's okay.

596
00:51:17,027 --> 00:51:18,869
Charley, what the hell is this?

597
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:20,955
Wait for me in the car.

598
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:24,375
Wait a fucking minute, man.

599
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,751
You don't tell nobody where to go.

600
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:26,794
She stays here...

601
00:51:28,796 --> 00:51:30,381
Get on your fucking knees.

602
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:32,299
Please.

603
00:51:33,342 --> 00:51:34,885
Put your hands behind your head.

604
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:37,388
Put your forehead on the ground.

605
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:40,516
And don't move.

606
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:45,229
Now, I wanna know where Fat Ed is

607
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:46,522
or I'm gonna kill you.

608
00:51:46,557 --> 00:51:49,358
Honest, senor, I don't
know no Fat Ed.

609
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:50,693
I was just lying.

610
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:52,611
I'm in a hurry.

611
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:54,947
I don't know, I don't know.

612
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,325
You telling me you
never heard of Melio,

613
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,160
T Bird, or Automatic Slim?

614
00:52:00,195 --> 00:52:02,329
Wait, please, please, senor.

615
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:04,248
Those sound like 'cuna boys.

616
00:52:04,283 --> 00:52:05,791
Go to Acuna.

617
00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:08,085
Ask for Billy Sanchez at El Lobo.

618
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,878
He knows everybody.

619
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:11,797
I don't know nobody.

620
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:13,924
Please, mister, please.

621
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:27,646
You could lose a hand like that.

622
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,936
Why'd you set me up in there?

623
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:09,980
- Move over.
- Who the hell is Fat Ed?

624
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:18,447
I thought I was taking off
with you for a good time.

625
00:53:18,656 --> 00:53:21,200
You're looking for those
guys, aren't you?

626
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:22,326
Aren't you.

627
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:25,287
You know who they are, don't you?

628
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,040
Don't you.

629
00:53:28,075 --> 00:53:29,416
Some of them.

630
00:53:30,668 --> 00:53:32,920
Well, why don't you
just tell the police?

631
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:36,423
Because I want to
find all of them.

632
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:41,679
Man, I have had it with
lying men, Charley.

633
00:53:41,714 --> 00:53:44,765
The ones that say one thing
and they do another.

634
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,809
The ones that always let you down.

635
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,145
Are you gonna let me down?

636
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:54,400
It depends on what
you're looking for.

637
00:53:54,435 --> 00:53:55,984
Right now, I'm gonna
take you to Acuna.

638
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,488
That's miles from here
and I'm dog tired.

639
00:53:59,822 --> 00:54:02,491
Come on, climb in the back
seat and go to sleep.

640
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:07,162
Why do I always get
stuck with crazy men?

641
00:54:07,197 --> 00:54:08,205
Man.

642
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,998
Because that's the
only kind that's left.

643
00:54:43,824 --> 00:54:44,908
Charley.

644
00:55:15,856 --> 00:55:18,025
My, brother-in-law took off on me.

645
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,152
He got pissed at my
sister and split.

646
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:21,779
I'd like you to run
him down for me.

647
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:23,906
You know, put out a 10-29
on him unofficially.

648
00:55:24,573 --> 00:55:25,866
I don't know.

649
00:55:25,901 --> 00:55:27,659
Come on, it wouldn't
be the first time.

650
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:29,870
Okay, but now you owe me one.

651
00:55:29,905 --> 00:55:30,954
All right.

652
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:34,416
Listen, it's a 1973 red
Cadillac convertible.

653
00:55:35,209 --> 00:55:39,713
Texas licence number,
temporary, 3-8-0-2 William.

654
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,091
Now, listen, when you find him,

655
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:44,593
I don't want you to pull
him over or nothing.

656
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:45,852
You just call me, understand?

657
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:49,723
Remember, you're in barrel
if anybody finds out.

658
00:55:49,758 --> 00:55:50,974
Don't worry, I'll cover you.

659
00:55:51,009 --> 00:55:52,434
- Okay, later.
- All right.

660
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:58,232
This is a 10-29, 73 red
Cadillac convertible.

661
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:17,124
You look better.

662
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:18,836
Does that mean I look good?

663
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:21,088
Sure does.

664
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:24,216
Well, anything would
be an improvement.

665
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:31,598
Hope you're not just stringing
me along, Charley Rane.

666
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:34,476
Hope that's not all you're doing.

667
00:56:35,978 --> 00:56:37,688
I don't have to do that, do I?

668
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,398
Maybe you do.

669
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:46,572
How old do you think I am?

670
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:48,657
Twenty-five.

671
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:54,621
Almost thirty.

672
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:57,499
I've been around the
course a couple times now.

673
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,585
Well, you sure don't look it.

674
00:57:01,712 --> 00:57:04,214
Well, I do in the morning,

675
00:57:04,249 --> 00:57:06,133
after I've been out
partying all night.

676
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:11,179
I do when I'm sitting alone
brooding about some worthless man.

677
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:12,723
I've had a few of 'em, you know?

678
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:19,187
What are you getting at?

679
00:57:20,564 --> 00:57:22,149
Only that you can trust me.

680
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,776
And I wanna know I can trust you.

681
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:28,071
I wanna help.

682
00:57:31,617 --> 00:57:32,951
Let's get outta here.

683
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:53,096
Why don't we tell them?

684
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:54,264
Forget it.

685
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:57,309
Poor Linda, here she goes again.

686
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,786
Hey, Jim, wasn't that the car?

687
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:16,995
I think it was.

688
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,665
They said no arrest, though,
just to call in on it.

689
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,999
Go ahead and get me some coffee.

690
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:28,924
- Cliff?
- Yo.

691
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:30,926
Your sister better
be good looking.

692
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:33,637
Because your brother-in-law's got
a real piece a ass with him.

693
00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:34,680
Yeah, where are they?

694
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:38,016
Outside Del Rio heading across
to Acuna on Highway 90.

695
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:39,142
Okay, thanks, Bob.

696
00:58:39,177 --> 00:58:40,852
Listen, I'll call you
for any updates, okay?

697
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:42,062
You bet.

698
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,083
Do you know a guy
named Billy Sanchez?

699
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:46,501
Why are you looking for him?

700
00:59:47,252 --> 00:59:48,545
He ain't no good for nothing.

701
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,047
I don't want him for nothing.

702
00:59:50,082 --> 00:59:51,173
I just want to talk to him.

703
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:53,216
He ain't even good for that.

704
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:57,804
- Hey, Billy?
- Yeah.

705
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:59,514
Lady here wants to talk to you.

706
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,562
Hello, lady.

707
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:08,148
What's your name?

708
01:00:08,183 --> 01:00:09,941
I'm looking for a
guy named Fat Ed.

709
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:11,651
I was told to ask for him here.

710
01:00:11,686 --> 01:00:13,570
I'm a friend of his
from San Antone.

711
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:15,697
That lucky old horse.

712
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:19,034
How does he get a friend like
you, ugly as he is, huh?

713
01:00:20,202 --> 01:00:21,328
What's your name, baby?

714
01:00:21,787 --> 01:00:23,205
Shari.

715
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,332
I was supposed to meet him
here a couple days ago,

716
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:26,583
but I got into something else.

717
01:00:26,618 --> 01:00:29,252
Aww, you mean, something
else got into you.

718
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:34,591
Ed wouldn't like
that kind of talk.

719
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:36,343
He ain't here to hear it.

720
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:39,554
When over to the Dean
house in El Paso.

721
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:40,722
Where's that?

722
01:00:40,757 --> 01:00:43,517
Around La Colina Road.

723
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:46,186
Did they all go over?

724
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:48,480
Yeah, all except Automatic Slim.

725
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:49,940
- He's still here.
- In Acuna?

726
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:52,984
Yeah, hey, why don't
you wait around?

727
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:55,570
He'll be back in a
couple of minutes.

728
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:58,198
He'll drive you over to El Paso if
you're really a friend of Fat Ed.

729
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:01,535
No, that's okay, I got my own car.

730
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,078
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

731
01:01:03,113 --> 01:01:04,121
I gotta go.

732
01:01:04,156 --> 01:01:05,790
Hey, come on, one drink
ain't gonna slow you down.

733
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,049
I said no thanks.

734
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:10,377
Charley, come on, let's
go, this is getting ugly.

735
01:01:10,919 --> 01:01:12,003
Start the car.

736
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:18,844
What kind of hustle you
two putting down, huh?

737
01:01:30,272 --> 01:01:32,315
You been looking for me, Major?

738
01:02:12,856 --> 01:02:14,149
Let me have him.

739
01:02:15,442 --> 01:02:16,985
Oh. Shit.

740
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,865
Let him go. Let him go.

741
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:26,536
Get away, get away from...

742
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:30,916
Let me... you gotta
get away from him.

743
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:04,574
When we get to El Paso, I am gone.

744
01:03:06,952 --> 01:03:09,496
You know, I'm not one to
leave a man in trouble.

745
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:11,581
But man, you don't
deserve any better.

746
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:16,628
I thought I could help you,
but that was a big mistake.

747
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:19,089
The same damn mistake
I always make.

748
01:03:19,714 --> 01:03:22,217
Well, the best thing that I
could do for you right now

749
01:03:22,252 --> 01:03:23,468
is just tell the police.

750
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,930
That's right, I'm gonna
tell the police.

751
01:03:26,965 --> 01:03:29,057
And man, if you won't
do it, I will.

752
01:03:29,092 --> 01:03:30,809
And you're not gonna
change my mind.

753
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,447
What is wrong with you?

754
01:03:44,482 --> 01:03:46,116
You're driving too slow.

755
01:03:47,284 --> 01:03:48,410
Where are you going?

756
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:51,538
I'm not staying in any car
with any damn lunatic.

757
01:03:51,573 --> 01:03:53,039
Then get out.

758
01:03:53,832 --> 01:03:54,832
Get out.

759
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:57,627
Get out.

760
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:04,175
God damn it.

761
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:33,538
Charley.

762
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:36,791
I'm all you got.

763
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:56,061
You feeling better now?

764
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:59,064
Better than what?

765
01:04:59,856 --> 01:05:01,524
Better than before?

766
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:04,694
I should be asking
you that question.

767
01:05:05,236 --> 01:05:06,780
You don't have to worry about me.

768
01:05:11,326 --> 01:05:14,371
I remember that song
from when I was alive.

769
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:16,456
Alive?

770
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:25,340
That's what we used to call the
time before we were captured.

771
01:05:52,492 --> 01:05:54,369
That's a hell of a wake-up call.

772
01:05:55,578 --> 01:05:57,038
What you doing?

773
01:05:59,249 --> 01:06:00,542
Practising.

774
01:06:02,419 --> 01:06:04,921
Must be planning on some
point-blank shooting.

775
01:06:05,505 --> 01:06:07,924
Sawing off the barrels don't
give you much distance.

776
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:33,199
I haven't used one in years.

777
01:06:33,234 --> 01:06:34,701
But I guess you never forget.

778
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:35,736
I grew up around 'em.

779
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:40,123
Where was that?

780
01:06:40,158 --> 01:06:41,166
Just around.

781
01:06:44,002 --> 01:06:46,254
My daddy was a Master
Sergeant in the army.

782
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:49,257
Still is.

783
01:06:49,674 --> 01:06:50,967
He teach you how to shoot?

784
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:53,136
Ride too.

785
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:01,436
See, he wanted a boy and
he got three girls.

786
01:07:02,854 --> 01:07:06,566
Or I should say two
girls and a tomboy.

787
01:07:07,442 --> 01:07:08,943
I'm kinda the black sheep.

788
01:07:14,824 --> 01:07:16,367
Why are you the black sheep?

789
01:07:20,288 --> 01:07:23,791
Well, I eloped when I was 17.

790
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:28,421
My mama was a churchgoing lady.

791
01:07:29,005 --> 01:07:30,642
She didn't like me
very much because

792
01:07:30,643 --> 01:07:31,925
I was my father's favourite.

793
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:36,679
So...

794
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:41,768
she just acted like
I was killing her.

795
01:07:49,442 --> 01:07:50,818
Guess they were right, though.

796
01:07:51,486 --> 01:07:53,279
I only stayed married for a year.

797
01:07:58,368 --> 01:08:00,870
I wish we had something
more exciting to shoot at.

798
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,753
Hiya.

799
01:10:14,462 --> 01:10:17,465
You have not seen a red Cadillac?

800
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:19,717
Yes.

801
01:10:37,026 --> 01:10:39,362
God, look at me, what a mess.

802
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:49,414
I'm gonna need a vacation
when this vacation's over.

803
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:52,458
I feel like I been gone for
two years instead a two days.

804
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:55,211
Sure would like to
soak in a hot tub.

805
01:10:57,004 --> 01:10:59,132
Where are you going now,
on parade or something?

806
01:10:59,799 --> 01:11:02,427
You don't have to get
all spruced up for me.

807
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:05,221
I like a little
naturalness in a man.

808
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:09,267
Doesn't your friend live here?

809
01:11:09,726 --> 01:11:11,269
The one I met in the hospital?

810
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:13,146
No.

811
01:11:15,732 --> 01:11:17,233
Johnny Vohden?

812
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:19,902
No.

813
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,245
He said he lived in El Paso.

814
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:31,622
Well, he doesn't.

815
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:40,757
Will you sit down and relax?

816
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,267
You know, you don't
have to do any of this.

817
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:54,437
You don't have to go
after these guys.

818
01:11:57,356 --> 01:12:00,109
You could just jump in the car and
go a thousand miles from here

819
01:12:00,144 --> 01:12:01,486
and nobody'd know any different.

820
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,782
Bury the guns in the desert.

821
01:12:18,002 --> 01:12:20,546
Are you just staying
with me for a while?

822
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:27,261
Hold me?

823
01:12:32,058 --> 01:12:33,643
Charley, I love you.

824
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:35,746
He knows about your car.

825
01:13:56,559 --> 01:13:59,687
The boy, he says you're,
looking for a Yankee

826
01:13:59,722 --> 01:14:01,272
that drives a big red Cadillac?

827
01:14:01,307 --> 01:14:02,815
That's right.

828
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:04,650
Five dollars.

829
01:14:09,864 --> 01:14:11,115
A Yankee, huh?

830
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:14,243
- With a big steel hand?
- Yeah.

831
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:16,537
He was here.

832
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:18,789
Where'd he go?

833
01:14:19,749 --> 01:14:21,334
That will be five more dollars.

834
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:23,169
Ten altogether.

835
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:24,879
Yes?

836
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:32,219
There was a big fight
and... now he's gone.

837
01:14:32,678 --> 01:14:33,846
Where?

838
01:14:34,764 --> 01:14:36,098
Why do you want to find him?

839
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:38,184
Hey, look, I'm paying,
I ask the questions.

840
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:41,771
Well, if you want some answers,
you have to pay a little more.

841
01:14:42,855 --> 01:14:44,732
Where the fuck did
you get this, huh?

842
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:10,711
Hey.

843
01:17:59,051 --> 01:18:01,720
Charley, you're the quietest
man I've ever known.

844
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:06,642
That's because I can't
think of anything to say.

845
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:17,903
It's like my eyes are open and I'm
looking at you, but I'm dead.

846
01:18:24,577 --> 01:18:27,705
They've pulled out whatever
it was inside of me.

847
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:35,045
It never hurt at all after
that and it never will.

848
01:18:49,685 --> 01:18:50,936
Charley?

849
01:18:53,981 --> 01:18:55,441
What?

850
01:18:58,194 --> 01:19:00,279
Are we going back to San Antone?

851
01:19:03,157 --> 01:19:04,742
If you want to.

852
01:19:09,246 --> 01:19:10,706
How about you?

853
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:17,087
I don't care if I ever
see that town again.

854
01:19:19,548 --> 01:19:21,967
Good, then let's go

855
01:19:22,384 --> 01:19:25,429
as far away as we can get.

856
01:19:29,016 --> 01:19:30,976
Let's go some place cold.

857
01:19:32,603 --> 01:19:34,396
Let's go to Alaska.

858
01:19:35,773 --> 01:19:37,483
Well, Alaska's cold.

859
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:42,571
People don't do anything
but just stay inside.

860
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:46,033
And sit in front of the fireplace.

861
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:50,955
And make love all day long.

862
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,298
Please tell me we're going.

863
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:43,859
Charley?

864
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:47,279
Charley.

865
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:22,731
Operator.

866
01:22:22,766 --> 01:22:25,692
Yeah, let me have the number
for the police department.

867
01:22:25,727 --> 01:22:27,694
- Emergency?
- Yes.

868
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:34,410
- 7-2-2-2-1.
- Thank you.

869
01:22:49,508 --> 01:22:51,051
El Paso Police Station.

870
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:49,776
That there is the last American
factory made convertible.

871
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:51,445
No more convertibles?

872
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,363
No, mam, those things
cost a fortune too.

873
01:23:53,398 --> 01:23:55,491
The Japanese start making 'em.

874
01:23:55,526 --> 01:23:56,658
That's what happens.

875
01:23:56,693 --> 01:23:59,453
We'll be buying our Cadillac
convertibles from Japan.

876
01:23:59,488 --> 01:24:03,332
Japan, I ain't buying
nothing from no Japs.

877
01:24:03,367 --> 01:24:06,376
The only colour Pop
recognises is white.

878
01:24:06,411 --> 01:24:09,880
Well, even white people don't
make things any good any more.

879
01:24:09,915 --> 01:24:13,717
I bought a US made TV because
I wanted to buy American.

880
01:24:13,752 --> 01:24:16,136
And it broke down in three weeks.

881
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:17,846
When the repairman came to fix it,

882
01:24:17,881 --> 01:24:20,390
he said all the parts were
made in Japan anyway.

883
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:23,185
So, next time I'm gonna buy
one straight from Japan.

884
01:24:24,353 --> 01:24:26,522
Don Visser's got a car
like the major's.

885
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,191
You remember Don Visser,
don't you, John.

886
01:24:29,226 --> 01:24:31,193
- No.
- Course you do.

887
01:24:31,228 --> 01:24:33,487
He went to high school right
around the time you did.

888
01:24:33,522 --> 01:24:36,365
He went on to play for the
Cowboys for two years.

889
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,076
Hell, he knows who Don Visser is.

890
01:24:39,111 --> 01:24:41,662
Everybody knows who Don Visser is.

891
01:24:42,246 --> 01:24:44,206
Come on, Susan, let's take
a look at that roast.

892
01:24:44,241 --> 01:24:45,582
I'll help ya.

893
01:24:45,617 --> 01:24:46,917
Excuse me.

894
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,298
John, can I talk to
you for a minute?

895
01:24:55,092 --> 01:24:56,593
Oh, yeah.

896
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,389
- Excuse me.
- Make yourself at home.

897
01:25:04,101 --> 01:25:06,895
Say, Pop, can I have
one of them cigars?

898
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:08,021
How's that?

899
01:25:08,056 --> 01:25:09,523
I say, can I have
one of them cigars?

900
01:25:09,558 --> 01:25:11,400
Oh, you betcha, boy.

901
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:22,119
Well, I'm sorry about
all this, Major.

902
01:25:23,245 --> 01:25:24,496
That's all right, John.

903
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:27,749
I found them.

904
01:25:27,784 --> 01:25:29,084
Who?

905
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:31,253
The men who killed my son.

906
01:25:39,595 --> 01:25:41,263
I'll just get my gear.

907
01:25:50,022 --> 01:25:52,816
They're in a whorehouse
over in Juarez right now.

908
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,156
There's the four that
came into my home

909
01:26:00,407 --> 01:26:01,867
and there's eight or ten others.

910
01:26:05,037 --> 01:26:06,538
Let's go clean 'em up.

911
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:24,139
Johnny, come on in,
everything's ready.

912
01:26:27,684 --> 01:26:30,646
Me and the major are gonna
go out and, get some beer.

913
01:26:30,681 --> 01:26:31,938
We'll be back after while.

914
01:26:31,973 --> 01:26:33,899
Well, what about your dinner?

915
01:26:35,025 --> 01:26:36,568
And why you wearing that thing?

916
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:40,155
He never wears his uniform
when I ask him to.

917
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:43,742
Goodbye, Daddy.

918
01:26:43,777 --> 01:26:45,202
Bye, son.

919
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:49,039
Well, where are you going?

920
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:53,085
You all get back here soon.

921
01:27:54,396 --> 01:27:55,856
They're all inside there now.

922
01:27:56,398 --> 01:27:57,941
There's a Texan with beige boots

923
01:27:57,976 --> 01:28:00,193
and a tall, skinny guy with
a straw hat who I want,

924
01:28:00,228 --> 01:28:02,154
and there's a couple of Mexicans.

925
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:03,613
Well, they'll recognise me,

926
01:28:03,648 --> 01:28:05,157
so why don't you go
in through the front

927
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:07,200
and pick up a hooker,
take her on upstairs.

928
01:28:07,235 --> 01:28:08,493
When you hear me coming,

929
01:28:08,528 --> 01:28:10,495
I'm gonna be tapping
my gun just like that.

930
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:11,955
When you hear that,
get yourself set.

931
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:14,583
And when you hear me
shooting, come on out.

932
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:59,085
Hey, soldier, you
wanna get married?

933
01:29:00,086 --> 01:29:01,755
Not to you, girl.

934
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:03,465
Got any nice American girls here?

935
01:29:04,174 --> 01:29:05,884
Take a look around, gringo.

936
01:29:05,919 --> 01:29:07,260
Maybe you'll find your sister.

937
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:18,355
I want a cervesa, please.

938
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:20,315
What kind of beer, mister?

939
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,234
Carta Blanca.

940
01:29:30,826 --> 01:29:32,160
See anything you like?

941
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:33,370
Oh, yeah.

942
01:29:35,413 --> 01:29:36,915
Thirty minutes, thirty dollars.

943
01:29:37,332 --> 01:29:39,417
God damn, I wanted to
rent you, not buy you.

944
01:29:39,835 --> 01:29:41,420
If you're looking
for a cheap thrill,

945
01:29:41,421 --> 01:29:42,879
why don't you go to the dog races?

946
01:29:46,007 --> 01:29:47,259
Lead on.

947
01:29:49,094 --> 01:29:50,595
Follow me.

948
01:30:07,237 --> 01:30:08,655
Soldier.

949
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:20,125
Let's go.

950
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,793
Now, take your time, sweetheart.

951
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,630
If I take some of my time,

952
01:31:06,665 --> 01:31:08,590
I'm gonna take a hell of a
lot more of your money.

953
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,592
Well, you'll get it
if you're worth it.

954
01:31:10,627 --> 01:31:11,843
That's what I like to hear.

955
01:31:37,702 --> 01:31:39,162
Well, gringo, where are you going?

956
01:32:19,369 --> 01:32:21,246
Do you wanna fuck or what?

957
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:23,373
I'm having a problem.

958
01:32:23,408 --> 01:32:24,666
You're gonna have to help me.

959
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:26,042
Shit.

960
01:32:36,678 --> 01:32:37,846
Relax.

961
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:07,977
It's your time, boy.

962
01:34:18,196 --> 01:34:20,115
What the fuck are you doing?

963
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:21,825
I'm gonna kill a bunch a people.

964
01:34:35,088 --> 01:34:36,464
Bye, boys.

965
01:35:13,835 --> 01:35:14,878
Hey.

966
01:35:41,905 --> 01:35:43,072
Major.

967
01:35:50,705 --> 01:35:53,082
Get your ass on
down here, fly-boy.

968
01:37:38,354 --> 01:37:40,148
Let's go home, John.
