1
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,583
At the center of the universe...

2
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,044
at the border
between the light and the dark...

3
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,755
stands Castle Grayskull.

4
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,424
For countless ages,
the Sorceress of Grayskull...

5
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,093
has kept this universe in harmony.

6
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,846
But the armies of darkness do not rest...

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,433
and the capture of Grayskull
is ever most in their minds.

8
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:04,396
For to those that control Grayskull
will come the power.

9
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,233
The power to be supreme.
The power to be almighty.

10
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,863
The power to be
masters of the universe.

11
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,065
Report, Evil-Lyn. Speak.

12
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,109
We have sealed the gates to the city.

13
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,363
The castle is secure and we are closing in
on the Thenurian as we speak.

14
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,742
- Yes, yes. And He-Man?
- He continues to lead the resistance.

15
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,079
I assure you,
we will have him before the day is out.

16
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:31,251
I want him kneeling at my feet.

17
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,171
After all this time...

18
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,716
- Grayskull is ours.
- No.

19
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,475
Mine.

20
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,437
The power of Grayskull...

21
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,981
has not yet passed to you.

22
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,402
Someone is speaking to me.

23
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,615
Yes. Sorceress.

24
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,700
My lovely prisoner.

25
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,871
My prisoner at last.

26
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,292
I've won. I've won.

27
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,463
The darkness is rising to embrace you.

28
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,759
The dark can embrace the light,
but never eclipse it.

29
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,803
You have not won yet, Skeletor.

30
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,554
He-Man is still alive.

31
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,099
- I can feel it.
- Really?

32
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,268
How sensitive you are.

33
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,937
Can you feel this?

34
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,077
Evil-Lyn, activate the holosphere.

35
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,625
People of Eternia, the war is over.

36
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,712
My forces are victorious.

37
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,424
The Sorceress of Grayskull
is my prisoner...

38
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,428
and her powers are now joined with mine.

39
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,431
Let this be my first decree:

40
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,643
Those who do not
pledge themselves to me...

41
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,105
shall be destroyed.

42
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,609
The new age begins.

43
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,177
- He-Man, thank the Sorceress you're alive.
- I've been looking for you.

44
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,436
Grayskull...

45
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,356
- It was terrible.
- How many units are left?

46
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:45,237
Not many. All of us were scattered.
Suddenly, they were everywhere.

47
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,447
- Chaos.
- Someone betrayed us.

48
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,991
Help! Help!

49
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,202
- Get me out of this!
- It's all right.

50
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,374
Help! Help! Help, somebody.

51
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,751
- Help.
- All right, all right, we heard you.

52
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,920
- Pull the pole out.
- Careful. Careful.

53
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,298
- Thank the Sorceress.
- I hear you.

54
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,887
Who are you?

55
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,974
I am Gwildor of Thenur...

56
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,725
locksmith and inventor.

57
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,854
Skeletor's forces were hunting me down.

58
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,023
A million blessings upon you
for saving my life.

59
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,111
No blessing is necessary.
Any foe of Skeletor's is a friend of ours.

60
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,030
Now, why are you so important
to Skeletor?

61
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,700
Help me.

62
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,124
I'd better show you. Please come with me.

63
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,383
I remember the days
we didn't have to lock our doors.

64
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,053
Those days will come back. Oh, yes.

65
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,023
Enter, enter.

66
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,360
Come on, come in. Welcome to my home.

67
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,696
Come on.

68
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,115
Come, come, come.

69
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:29,382
Now, you ask
why is Skeletor after me?

70
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,385
Because of my invention.

71
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,973
Because of this.

72
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,227
Now I wish I hadn't created it.

73
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:44,397
Skeletor wants me killed
so I can't make another one.

74
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,943
If he knew I had this prototype...

75
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,236
What is it?

76
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,404
What does it do?

77
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,950
I call it...

78
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,036
the Cosmic Key.

79
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:05,252
It is the most unique key in the universe.

80
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,212
The tones it generates...

81
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,382
can open a doorway to anywhere.

82
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,051
- Anywhere?
- Exactly.

83
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,595
One simply computes gravitonic tones...

84
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,806
for a specific destination...

85
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,808
activates the energizer and...

86
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:24,729
And that's how Skeletor's troops
got into the city and surprised us.

87
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,568
Yes. Yes.

88
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,281
- I'm afraid so.
- You little worm.

89
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,576
- Don't you realize what you've done?
- Easy, Teela. He didn't know.

90
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,539
That's right. How could I know?
We Thenurians are a peaceful race.

91
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,666
Trusting in every way.

92
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,669
A woman came to see me.

93
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,214
Said she heard about my fame
as a locksmith.

94
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,135
She seemed interested in my work.

95
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,554
How could I know
she was from Snake Mountain?

96
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,848
- She was beautiful.
- That would be Evil-Lyn.

97
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,434
She tricked me. She stole the key.

98
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,935
Gwildor...

99
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,105
can this device of yours
get us to Grayskull?

100
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,983
- Certainly.
- To the Sorceress?

101
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,570
Those were the first coordinates
I calculated before she came.

102
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,739
- Oh, good.
- Oh, but we can't. We can't.

103
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:20,201
If we disturb the gravitonic waves,
Skeletor's key will locate us.

104
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,247
Sounds like he's already located us.

105
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,833
Warlord, to the point.

106
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,214
No, no, no. Not that way.
This way, the secret passage.

107
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,218
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Go.

108
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,554
- In the corner, there. Let's move.
- Right.

109
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,389
Gwildor, where does this lead?

110
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,975
To the caverns underneath Grayskull.

111
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,560
Ionize.

112
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,896
Gwildor, hurry.

113
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,273
- Yes, yes.
- Come on.

114
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,526
I don't like adventures.

115
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,707
Secure the room. Hurry.

116
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,463
Find the key. Tear this place apart.

117
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,808
He-Man, we made it. Look.

118
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,268
Ssh! I know he's here waiting for us.

119
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:31,439
- You're right. It's too quiet.
- Look. The Sorceress.

120
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,400
Come on.

121
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,152
Gwildor, hurry.

122
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,155
Be careful.

123
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,615
Quiet.

124
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,970
Sorceress?

125
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,389
Sorceress, we'll free you.

126
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,059
Skeletor has imprisoned me
within this energy field...

127
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,062
which only he can dissolve.

128
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,483
- You are in danger here. You must leave.
- We won't leave without you, Sorceress.

129
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,361
Gwildor, can your key open a door
to the force field?

130
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,071
- Of course.
- Then do it now.

131
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,365
- It'll take time.
- Let's get started then.

132
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,826
Gwildor, over here.

133
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,581
I have to take a reading
and compute the gravitonic tones.

134
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,711
- He's taking your power.
- I can withstand him until moonrise.

135
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,131
Until the Great Eye opens on the universe.

136
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,425
They're coming.

137
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,678
Gwildor, get back there. Keep working.

138
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,015
Come on. Come on.

139
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,252
Everything comes to he who waits.

140
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,927
And I have waited so very long
for this moment.

141
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,014
- Let her go.
- I don't think so.

142
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,058
No.

143
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,645
While she remains imprisoned
within this field...

144
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:39,067
her powers increase my own,
and when the moon reaches its zenith...

145
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:44,280
the Great Eye will open
and all the powers of Grayskull...

146
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,616
will be bestowed upon me.

147
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,536
Your wondrous Sorceress...

148
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,872
- will die.
- You dare threaten her life?

149
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,333
I dare anything.

150
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,669
I am Skeletor.

151
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:02,423
Throw down your weapons
and pledge yourselves to me...

152
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,427
- Or you will join her.
- It's not her you want, it's me.

153
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,721
It's always been between us.

154
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,973
Silence.

155
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,601
It's the locksmith.

156
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,771
- The little worm has another key.
- What?

157
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,107
No.

158
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,733
Kill him!

159
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,029
Cover Gwildor! Keep working.

160
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,467
Gwildor.

161
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:51,139
- Can that thing get us out of here?
- It will. It will. But where?

162
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,601
- Anywhere. Just do it fast.
- Yes, yes, yes.

163
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,900
It's working.

164
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,652
It's working, it's working.

165
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,829
Man-at-Arms, Teela. I did it!

166
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:22,128
- The door. It's open. Let's go. He-Man!
- No. I won't leave her.

167
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,256
But you must.
Eternia needs you alive, He-Man.

168
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,759
You still have until moonrise. Go.

169
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,434
He-Man, let's move. Come on, go.

170
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,727
Come on, Gwildor.

171
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,564
Stop him.

172
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,861
- Gwildor, come on!
- The door! The door!

173
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,495
- Gwildor!
- My key.

174
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,122
The key. Get the key.

175
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,601
Find them. Trace them!

176
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,521
I want them and that key hunted down
and brought to me.

177
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,023
It looked as if he was punching the keys
at random.

178
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,610
- There's no way of telling where they went.
- Monitor the frequencies.

179
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,323
Wherever they are, they'll use it again.
When they do, lock it in.

180
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,452
He-Man lives and possesses that key.

181
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,124
I must possess all or I possess nothing.

182
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,501
Find them.

183
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,164
Are you all right?

184
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,126
Trust a Thenurian
to find a soft place to land.

185
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,088
Thank you.

186
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,383
I could have suffocated
in that loathsome stuff.

187
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,344
Stop complaining. It's only mud.

188
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,931
That's easy to say
when you don't have clogged gill slits.

189
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,896
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.

190
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,606
- I'm sorry.
- Gwildor.

191
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,108
We must get back to Eternia.

192
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,279
So if you're through clearing your gill
slits, maybe you can tell us where we are.

193
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,031
We could be anywhere.

194
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,866
Any planet in the galaxy.

195
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,368
Any planet in a thousand galaxies.

196
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,872
I had no time to renominalize
my coordinates.

197
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,875
You got us here, you Thenurian wurbat,
now you get us home.

198
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,920
Calm down. Now, we're all in this together.

199
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,547
How can he get us home
if we don't know where we are?

200
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,216
I'm not a Torktum, you know.

201
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,803
I wouldn't build a device
that didn't store its home coordinates.

202
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,226
All we have to do
is punch the energizer switch and...

203
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,025
Where is the key?

204
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,986
Perimeter search.
Each of us take a sector.

205
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,781
What's that?

206
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,542
Scan the area.

207
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,047
Alien life form. Big.

208
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,382
- Let me blast it.
- Wait.

209
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,883
It might be intelligent life.

210
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,223
By the Sorceress, it's ugly.

211
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,599
It seems harmless.

212
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,314
What a hideous cry.

213
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,859
Maybe I can communicate
with the poor creature.

214
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,402
Gwildor.

215
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,488
Gwildor.

216
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,991
Gwildor, we have very little time.

217
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,744
He-Man, I show 0.84 chromons
until moonrise at Grayskull.

218
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,747
- We'd better find the key, and fast.
- What's your plan?

219
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,959
When we find the key,
Gwildor will set coordinates for Grayskull.

220
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,421
- We'll use the element of surprise.
- Drop right into the throne room...

221
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,090
fight off 2- or 3000
of Skeletor's crack troops...

222
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,676
break into the force field
and free the Sorceress.

223
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,803
- Right.
- If we're gonna split up...

224
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,014
we'd better synchronize
our personal locators.

225
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,307
You both ready? And:

226
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,809
If you find the key...

227
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,228
- activate the sourcing signal.
- The sourcing signal.

228
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,730
- Good journey.
- Good journey.

229
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,565
Good journey.

230
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,110
Moo.

231
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,404
Moo?

232
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,991
Moo!

233
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,579
- Gwildor.
- I'm going. I'm going. Moo.

234
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,129
- Thanks. Come again.
- Sure thing, ma'am.

235
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,757
Billy, get off the game
and get Daddy some napkins.

236
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,553
I never thought I'd feel sad
about doing that for the very last time.

237
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,140
Don't worry, Julie.
They've got fast food in Jersey.

238
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,226
Thanks a lot.

239
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,897
I got a going-away present for you,
but it isn't wrapped.

240
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,816
- You didn't have to do that.
- It isn't even in a box.

241
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,778
It's a piece of advice,
and I pray to God you listen to it.

242
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,951
If you break up with Kevin Corrigan, you
will regret it for the rest of your life.

243
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,370
Monica, this is not
the seventh grade anymore.

244
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,457
Kevin's changed. I've changed.
Everything's different now.

245
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,459
Fine. Except for two things.

246
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,295
A: You still love him
and B: He still loves you.

247
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,714
Kevin doesn't need me
or my problems right now.

248
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,801
I just feel if I stayed...

249
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,428
Julie, I know it's hard right now...

250
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,847
but you don't have to move away.

251
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,893
- Yes, I do.
- Your folks would've wanted you to stay.

252
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,939
The best thing for me to do right now
is to get 3000 miles away from Kevin...

253
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,859
my house, this town and everything,
and just start out fresh.

254
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,489
- That's Kevin.
- I'm gonna miss you.

255
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,751
So, what time's your bus to the airport?

256
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,837
- Eight-thirty.
- Oh, great.

257
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,423
You can make my sound check, right?

258
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,383
Yeah?

259
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,095
- Yes, I'll make your sound check.
- All right.

260
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,308
- I brought us dinner.
- Oh, boy, Robby's ribs.

261
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,185
- I thought something different for a change.
- Oh, yes.

262
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,231
Yeah, well, it's not very romantic
for our last date.

263
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,904
Look, Julie, why don't you take
a later flight?

264
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,158
Kevin, don't start that again.

265
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,326
We decided.

266
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,997
Okay.

267
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,543
Kevin, I'd like to go to the cemetery
to say goodbye to my parents.

268
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,421
Yeah, sure.

269
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,859
Don't ever sneak up on me like that.

270
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,320
This is my sector.
You're not supposed to be here.

271
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,906
An old soldier learns to follow his nose.

272
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,701
- Oh, father, you're always hungry.
- I'm not always hungry.

273
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,828
During the Siege of Kreyf, 30 days...

274
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,705
Without rations.

275
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,792
Father, the Sorceress.
We must find the key.

276
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,462
We're not gonna save Eternia
if we die of starvation.

277
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,756
Wait. Look.

278
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,426
I was doing that
before you were born.

279
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,763
Not the natives, Father.
There, in the bushes.

280
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,526
Gwildor.

281
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,040
Holding out on us?

282
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,921
Just in time. I was going to share.
I was going to share.

283
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,006
Sure you were.

284
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,468
Teela.

285
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,638
Good food.

286
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,474
Yes, I've never tasted anything like it.

287
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,478
I wonder why they put their food
on these little white sticks.

288
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,063
Those are rib bones.

289
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,822
You mean this used to be an animal?

290
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,121
What a barbaric world.

291
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,165
Never think while you're hungry.

292
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:24,712
I think we've wasted enough time.
We better get back to our sectors.

293
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,674
Gwildor.

294
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,718
It tasted good.

295
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,305
- Gwildor.
- I'm going. I'm going.

296
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:41,645
I never told anyone this before,
but it's my fault they died.

297
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,524
Julie, come on.

298
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,905
It was a plane crash.
Those things just happen.

299
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,992
You don't understand.

300
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,079
We were all supposed to go
to the beach that day.

301
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,375
But I said I had to study because
I wanted to spend the day with you.

302
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,964
So they took the plane to Catalina instead.

303
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,550
Hey, come on.

304
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,558
Your mom and dad wouldn't want you to go
around the rest of your life blaming yourself.

305
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,354
- Would they?
- No.

306
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,403
I wish...

307
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,073
I wish I could change things.

308
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,326
But you can't.

309
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,121
That only happens in fairy tales.

310
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,880
What is that?

311
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,635
- Julie, be careful.
- Kev, look at this thing.

312
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,638
That is incredible. What is it?

313
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,640
Don't know.
Someone must have dropped it.

314
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,768
Dropped it, are you kidding?
Look at the size of that hole.

315
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,104
It's like it fell out of
the sky or something.

316
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,858
This is one of those
new Japanese synthesizers.

317
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,361
- Here, let me try it.
- Okay.

318
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,367
Listen to this. Oh, this is hot.

319
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,705
We've got to turn this in to the caretaker.

320
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,375
No way, come on, are you kidding?
He'd just keep this for himself.

321
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,882
The Cosmic Key has been activated.

322
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,219
- We have a bearing on them.
- How accurate?

323
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,346
Within a parsec eon.

324
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:46,687
The next time they use the key,
lock in the source and open a doorway.

325
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,691
- Shall I prepare a full battalion?
- No. It may be a trap.

326
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,402
We'll send an advance group.

327
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,447
Assemble the mercenaries.

328
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,784
Have faith, Sorceress.

329
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,454
You won't be lonely long.

330
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,478
Julie. Here, listen to this.

331
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,861
- What do you think?
- Sounds great.

332
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,031
Okay.

333
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,660
I want to see what this
thing can really do.

334
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:47,206
Test. Test, test. Hello, test.

335
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,124
Here, hold that.

336
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,377
What are you going to do?

337
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,630
I'm going to amp this baby up.
See how it sounds.

338
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,548
All right, are you ready?

339
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,384
Hold on.

340
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,011
All right, here goes.

341
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,570
I can't believe it.

342
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,115
Override complete.

343
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,826
We're locking in
on the key's source of origin.

344
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,120
Very good. Excellent.

345
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,747
You are too easily pleased, Evil-Lyn.

346
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,292
Have you forgotten time is of the essence?

347
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,544
Show me.

348
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,844
There. That's close enough.

349
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:48,434
- Have you assembled the mercenaries?
- Here, and awaiting your command.

350
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,938
I have selected your finest warriors.

351
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,231
Blade.

352
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,652
Saurod.

353
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,323
The Beastman.

354
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,745
And Karg.

355
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,253
A curious quartet.

356
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,590
He-Man has slipped away from me.

357
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,508
I want him back.

358
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,052
This must happen before moonrise.

359
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,556
Now, you are to go through to this world
to where they are hiding...

360
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,849
find the key...

361
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:33,395
do as you wish with the others,
but bring He-Man back alive.

362
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,147
You do understand?

363
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,982
Yes, lord.

364
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,443
Good.

365
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,364
Open the door. Do not fail me.

366
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,537
I... I can't believe this thing.
I mean, did you see those lights?

367
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,748
Look, we've gotta take this
down to Charlie.

368
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,959
- He's gotta know what this is.
- No, you go ahead.

369
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:00,130
This sounds really strange,
but I want to spend some time here alone.

370
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,675
Say goodbye to the place.
I'm not gonna be here for graduation.

371
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,262
Look, Julie,
I'll just go by Charlie's later, okay?

372
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,931
No, no, go ahead, I promise.

373
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,724
Are you sure?

374
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,561
Okay, all right.
I'll be gone 15 minutes, tops. All right?

375
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,856
- Don't let anybody in here except Carl.
- All right.

376
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,025
Hear me? Bye.

377
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,903
- I'll guard this stuff for you.
- All right. Bye.

378
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,356
Carl?

379
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,744
Carl, is that you?

380
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,622
- Blade.
- Deserted. No sign of the key.

381
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,000
Scan the perimeter. No one in, no one out.

382
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,462
Kevin, if this is some kind of joke,
it's really not funny.

383
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,966
Listen, you kids can't just come in...

384
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,511
Don't kill him yet.

385
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,188
Leave him alone!

386
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,448
Somebody help me.
Somebody help me!

387
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:54,036
No, no. Take her alive.
She may know where the key is.

388
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,789
Over there.

389
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,625
That way. Go around.

390
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,393
- I've got you, pretty.
- No!

391
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,978
No!

392
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,521
Let go, stay away from me!

393
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,689
Let go!

394
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,609
Get her.

395
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,364
She's mine.

396
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,210
Stop her.

397
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,087
Somebody help!

398
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:53,845
Move, you animals. Go, go, go.

399
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,390
Find her. Find her!

400
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,611
Help me! Help me!

401
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,951
Somebody help me!

402
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,371
Oh God, help.

403
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,087
She's in there. This way.

404
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,351
She's in here somewhere. Find her.

405
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,236
- Get away from me.
- It's all right.

406
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,573
It's all right.
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.

407
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,867
Now, what are you running from?

408
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,828
I'm running from these, these...

409
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,872
- monsters.
- Easy, easy.

410
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,083
- These creatures...
- I'll take care of it.

411
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,837
Look in there.

412
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,050
You, look up that way.

413
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,634
Search over there.

414
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,346
- You. Over there.
- No.

415
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,516
Search in there. Hurry.

416
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,858
Here, take this.

417
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,818
Protect yourself.

418
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,157
She's over here.

419
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,450
This way.

420
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,033
No!

421
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,930
I've waited a long time for this.

422
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,822
My sword.

423
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,871
Pretty.

424
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,393
Retreat. Retreat!

425
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,364
Follow them.
They must have a doorway to Eternia.

426
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,533
Are you all right?

427
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,456
They're gone now. You're safe.
You're safe. Do you understand?

428
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:56,087
Good. I know you've been through a
great deal, but I need your help.

429
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,683
Hey, hey, hey! Charlie.

430
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,103
- Charlie!
- Hey, Kev, how are you?

431
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,773
Hey, turn that down, turn that down.

432
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,733
Look, wait until you see this.

433
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,153
Oh, hey, I heard you were good last night
at Club Zero.

434
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,572
Thanks. Thanks.
We're going to be better tonight.

435
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,575
- I want you to take a look at this baby?
- All right.

436
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,911
All right, here.

437
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,207
- What do you think?
- I've seen these before.

438
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,042
- You have?
- Yeah.

439
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,045
- It's Japanese.
- Oh, no, no, no.

440
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,506
I don't think so. Here, look.

441
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,801
Press a few of these buttons. Go ahead.

442
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,014
Now press that red button in the front.

443
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,182
Go ahead.

444
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,861
Far out. Fantastic.

445
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,951
You know, I guess if you've seen one,
you've seen them all, right?

446
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,954
Thanks a lot, Charlie.
I'll talk to you later.

447
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,164
- Come back here. Where'd you get that?
- What?

448
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,251
- You wanna sell it?
- No, no. Look, I don't wanna sell it.

449
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,629
I found this at Laurelwood.
Man, you would not believe it.

450
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,465
It was like... It was lying
in this huge crater.

451
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,884
I was just hoping
you'd know something about it.

452
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,305
- I never saw anything like it.
- Look, we gotta figure out...

453
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,723
- What's that?
- How...

454
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,475
D sharp.

455
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,686
Oh, Mr. Perfect-Pitch.

456
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:41,526
All hell's breaking loose out there.
Let's see what's up.

457
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,572
All units, Code 6.

458
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,032
Proceed to Central High School.

459
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,534
Fire and vandalism. Possible arson.

460
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,911
All units, Code 6.

461
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,748
- Oh, my God.
- Proceed to Central High. Fire and vandalism.

462
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,334
- Julie's in there.
- Proceed with caution.

463
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,504
Our only hope of defeating Skeletor
is to find the Cosmic Key.

464
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,466
Now, those creatures were after you
for a reason, Julie.

465
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,760
Have you seen it?

466
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,680
- It's this large. It has lights on it.
- Wait a minute, I have seen that.

467
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,559
My boyfriend and I found this thing
that had light and music coming out of it.

468
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,353
That's it. Where is it?

469
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,482
- Well, Kevin has it.
- He's in terrible danger. Let's go.

470
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,196
- Let's call it back.
- Everything's all clear in the room.

471
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,389
- Carl. Carl, what happened?
- You don't never wanna know.

472
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,600
Wait, listen to me. Carl, where is Julie?

473
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,061
What happened to Julie?

474
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,734
- There you go.
- Excuse me.

475
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,404
- Where you going?
- My girlfriend's in there, all right?

476
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,907
Kid, we swept the place.
The only person we found was the janitor.

477
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,910
No, you don't understand.
I just left her here 10 minutes ago.

478
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,579
I'm telling you,
we went through there with a police dog.

479
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,666
The only stuff we found in there
was right there.

480
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,919
Dear God, that's Julie's.
Where'd you find this?

481
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,546
Where do you think we found it?

482
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:28,508
Listen, we got vandalism, arson, we got a
lot of bad stuff going on around here.

483
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,220
- What do you know about it?
- Look, I don't know anything about it, all right?

484
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,556
You're the cop.
Why aren't you looking for her?

485
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:39,227
- What does she look like?
- Look, she's about 5'5".

486
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:43,356
She's got short, dark hair.
She was wearing a pink sweater.

487
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,651
Is that all you're gonna do,
you're gonna write?

488
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,445
Why aren't you out doing something?

489
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,448
I'll do something.
I'll take you for a little ride. Let's go.

490
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,615
Oh, great.

491
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,327
- What are you doing, arresting me?
- We're gonna go look for your girlfriend.

492
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,456
We'll try her house first.
I bet you know where that is.

493
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,623
Harry, do me a favor.

494
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,252
Take that down to Properties,
give me a full report, okay?

495
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,173
Keep the coffee hot.
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.

496
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,217
Come on, guys, let's go. Let's put it out.

497
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,057
- He-Man, they got away.
- Easy, Julie.

498
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,934
What happened?

499
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,687
These are friends of mine:
Teela and her father, Duncan.

500
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,356
- Man-at-Arms for Eternian High Command.
- This is Julie.

501
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,817
She knows who has the key,
wants to help us.

502
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,319
- Good.
- Did you have any luck?

503
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,781
- Not as much as you, apparently.
- We tracked them spinward, 40 metrons.

504
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,451
- Then they disappeared.
- They're only a scouting party.

505
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,037
Let's find that key
before they return in full force.

506
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,830
- Julie, which way?
- This way.

507
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,254
Take arms. Full power.

508
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,965
Ready.

509
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,472
Native transportation. A primitive
land boat. Enter, enter.

510
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,182
Gwildor.

511
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,768
Well done, Gwildor.

512
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,189
It was an inefficient combustible system,
but I fixed it.

513
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,817
It runs on lucrenos now.
No hydrocarbons needed.

514
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,708
Why is there still resistance?

515
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,965
The people must know that I am Grayskull.

516
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:35,927
I depend upon you for these things.

517
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,346
You know that.

518
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,848
The people...

519
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,935
wait for He-Man.

520
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,063
They believe that he will
return to lead them.

521
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,067
For you to rule completely...

522
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,404
he must be destroyed.

523
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:59,784
He-Man. If I kill him,
I make him a martyr, a saint.

524
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,246
No, I want him broken.

525
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,018
Where is the key?

526
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,686
We...

527
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:33,234
traced the key's signal
but were unable to take possession of it.

528
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,652
Is that all?

529
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,616
We... We fought with the Eternians,
but were outnumbered.

530
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,160
We thought it wise to return alive...

531
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:46,122
- and gather a larger force.
- So He-Man's free?

532
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,468
You are all aware
of the penalty for failure?

533
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,722
Give me one more chance, Lord Skeletor,
and we will succeed.

534
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,392
I am not in the giving vein this day.

535
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,659
Get away.

536
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,164
He begs your forgiveness, as do we all.

537
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:34,462
- We live only to serve you.
- It would be a pity to waste their talents.

538
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,716
Save your pity for yourself, if you fail.

539
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,303
Take them and whatever troops
and resources you need.

540
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,849
- I was not suggesting that I go.
- Then you should not have spoken.

541
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,434
Leave immediately.

542
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,813
When you find the key,
send the sourcing signal.

543
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,984
An attack force will join you
or I will follow.

544
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,865
Go.

545
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,801
Maybe your girlfriend's here.
The lights are on.

546
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,095
No. They leave that on
to scare off burglars.

547
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,181
Oh, yeah? Let's go see.

548
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,314
Hey, not so fast, kid.

549
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,031
- Hello?
- Kevin, thank God it's you.

550
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,871
- Julie's not here right now.
- Kevin, this is Julie. What's going on?

551
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:54,584
Well, it's good to hear your voice, too,
but I've been really worried about Julie.

552
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:59,839
- Kevin, is someone there? Are you okay?
- Yeah. That's what I thought too.

553
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,299
Look, this is important.

554
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:05,219
I know you can't talk, just say yes or no.
Do you still have that thing we found?

555
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,349
Thank God.

556
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:14,520
All right, listen. Don't do anything.
I have so much to explain to you.

557
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:19,066
Just stay there, we'll be right there.
Stay put, all right?

558
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,444
I love you. Bye.

559
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,864
- Okay, if you talk to Julie, could you tell her...
- Wait a minute.

560
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,367
This is the police, who is this?
Who is this?

561
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:32,079
- Who were you talking to?
- It was just a friend of Julie's.

562
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,581
- Say, you hungry?
- No.

563
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,585
You were talking about this thing,
weren't you?

564
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,592
- What... What is this thing?
- It's a synthesizer.

565
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,552
Yeah?

566
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,556
- How does this thing work?
- Just press these buttons right here.

567
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,142
- Like this?
- Careful, careful.

568
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,818
Do you want to know something, kid?

569
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,238
I don't think this is any synthesizer.

570
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,551
This is where they ambushed us.
We didn't have a chance.

571
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,970
We'll see. Scanner.

572
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,230
I see only He-Man.

573
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,275
Where are the forces that you spoke of?

574
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,990
And a native girl.

575
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,994
It must have been she
who tipped the scales against you.

576
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,706
Outnumbered?

577
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:01,002
- Outclassed is more like it.
- The key has been activated.

578
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,545
Lock onto the signal.

579
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,798
It's close. About 10 metrons.

580
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,510
You wanna see what that thing does,
press the red button down at the bottom.

581
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,887
What? This one?

582
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,934
Holy smokes.

583
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,813
What are you, a magician?

584
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,816
How do you stop this?

585
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,411
What's a kid like you
doing with something like that?

586
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,872
- Come on. It's my instrument.
- Yeah.

587
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,208
All right, look, let me heat this up,
then I'll show you, okay?

588
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,629
We're getting interference.
They're jamming the signal.

589
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,882
Locate the source of the jamming
and destroy it.

590
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,635
It's difficult,
like nothing I've seen before.

591
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,387
Destroy it now.

592
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,769
Watch... Watch out.

593
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:06,776
The source of interference is destroyed.
We have a clear signal from the key.

594
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,820
Lock it in. We'll track it from the air.

595
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,157
Turkey, sit down.

596
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,202
- No more crapping around. What is this?
- I don't know.

597
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,331
Listen, I got vandalism, I got arson,
I got stuff blowing up in my face.

598
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,459
- You better know something.
- Look, I found it, okay?

599
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,963
- Found it? You don't know who the owner is?
- No.

600
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,257
Listen, I was gonna go put a note
down at Charlie's Music Store.

601
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,344
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take this to the station...

602
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,889
put it on the computer, check it out,
see if it's reported stolen.

603
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,601
Now, for the last time, kid,
where'd you find this?

604
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,982
Laurelwood Cemetery.
It was in a flowerbed.

605
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,360
Look, if you don't believe me,
go ask Charlie, all right?

606
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,905
- Go ahead, ask him.
- Boy...

607
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,409
- I just may do that.
- Hey, you can't just take that.

608
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,077
Oh, yeah? You just watch me.

609
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,998
Don't worry about your girlfriend. We got
an APB out on her. She won't get far.

610
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,458
As far as this is concerned,
don't worry about it.

611
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,795
If your story checks
out, you'll get it back.

612
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,423
If.

613
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,285
Get out of here! Get out of here.
Get out of here.

614
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,507
What do you want from me?

615
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,803
No. Leave him.

616
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,936
You have the Cosmic Key.
Tell us where it is.

617
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,147
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

618
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,858
- Let me persuade him.
- No.

619
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,943
The collar.

620
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,410
Please. Look, I don't know what you want.

621
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,457
Now...

622
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,586
you will answer my questions.

623
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,007
Yes.

624
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,321
Have you seen...

625
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,282
this object?

626
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,623
Yes.

627
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,209
Where is it?

628
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,880
- It was taken from me.
- Who took it?

629
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,300
A policeman.

630
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:19,927
Where is he now?

631
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,013
I don't know. He...

632
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,057
He just left.

633
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,393
We should be able to track the key
from the air.

634
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,520
Yes.

635
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,150
Prepare the transport immediately.

636
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:41,240
Wait. Evil-Lyn, I found this.

637
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,910
This is the native girl
who is helping He-Man.

638
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:50,291
- This may prove useful.
- Into the transport. Move.

639
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,503
Move it out!

640
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,130
Move.

641
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,804
- Fan out.
- Moving.

642
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,641
- Looks like Skeletor got here before us.
- It's all clear.

643
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,517
- Stay ready.
- Kevin!

644
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,561
Kevin.

645
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,774
Oh, my God, Kevin, you all right?
He's bleeding.

646
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,275
What happened?

647
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,779
They asked me for the key,
but I didn't have it.

648
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:06,158
- The Cosmic Key.
- Kevin, did they take it?

649
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,910
No.

650
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,705
- A policeman took it.
- Where is he now?

651
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,332
What is this thing?

652
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,376
- What's the matter?
- Skeletor's work.

653
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,962
The Collar of Aldruber.
They've been questioning him.

654
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,631
- I'll have it off in a moment.
- He'll be all right.

655
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,883
Who put this on you?

656
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,760
A woman.

657
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,764
- Strange eyes.
- Evil-Lyn. She's here.

658
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,267
From the looks of this place,
she definitely wasn't alone.

659
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,810
Right.

660
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,061
You all right?

661
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:40,276
Julie. Julie, get out of here. Now!

662
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,445
Damn.

663
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,740
- Kevin, these are my friends.
- Your friends? Julie.

664
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,744
Look, will somebody tell me
what the hell is going on here?

665
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:54,540
- These creatures come in and beat the crap...
- Kevin, listen to me.

666
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,667
These people are fighting the others.

667
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,336
- They saved my life, now trust me.
- Trust you?

668
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,089
Julie, I swear to God, these...

669
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,925
things come in here...
I mean, look at this place.

670
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,597
Look. Look. Native clothing.
Lots of it, all over the place.

671
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,893
If we dress like this,
no one will recognize us.

672
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,980
- What the hell is that?
- See?

673
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,692
That's Gwildor.
Look, Kevin, I'll explain to you as we go.

674
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,902
We've gotta help these people
find the key.

675
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,322
- Are you well enough to go with us?
- Go with you?

676
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,742
Tell us where that policeman was headed
and we'll take it from there.

677
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:33,996
- Kevin, please.
- I wish I'd never seen that damn thing.

678
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:38,792
Okay, look. He said he was gonna
go to Charlie's Music Store, all right?

679
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,379
- It's at Landmark Mall.
- Can you show us the way?

680
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,131
- Of course.
- No.

681
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,227
Charlie, the kid said you know
about this kind of stuff.

682
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,938
You don't think this could be Russian?

683
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,998
Well, what do you know?
The mountain comes to Mohammed.

684
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:26,173
Hey, how come I get this feeling
I've been looking for you all night?

685
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,509
I believe you have something
that belongs to us.

686
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,470
- Let me guess. That music gizmo there?
- By the Sorceress...

687
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,472
Freeze. All of you.

688
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,643
Choice, really choice.
What's this, a circus act?

689
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,853
Somebody's gonna give me
some answers here.

690
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,815
- Let's start with you, blondie.
- We're not your enemies.

691
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,484
If you'd just give us that,
we would be very grateful.

692
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,945
You get nothing until I get some answers.

693
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,365
- He-Man, He-Man. Someone's following us.
- What the hell is that?

694
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,284
Neutrino Drive,
18 metrons and closing fast.

695
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,078
- It's them.
- At 10.

696
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,830
They've locked in on the key.

697
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,708
- Hey. Drop your weapons or I...
- He-Man.

698
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,171
Gwildor, how long to calculate
the coordinates and take us home?

699
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:09,049
I don't know.
The keys have all been moved.

700
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:13,303
- Boy, are you people in trouble.
- He-Man, 0.61 chromons until moonrise.

701
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,848
- Teela, take these people in the back.
- Let's go.

702
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,683
You can't order me around.

703
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,811
If you'd rather stay and face
Evil-Lyn's commandos, that's fine.

704
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,564
Look, believe me, sir, you wouldn't.

705
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:30,529
Evil-Lyn, just as the signal indicated...

706
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,365
the natives and the key
are within the structure, but...

707
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,827
- Yes, Karg?
- He-Man.

708
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,414
The Eternians have already arrived.

709
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:45,252
Beastman, full-force attack at my command.
Karg, Blade...

710
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,296
follow me.

711
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,345
How do you feel?

712
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,097
I'm feeling a little hungry.

713
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:07,107
- Gwildor, you've got to hurry.
- I'm working as fast as I can.

714
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,027
There.

715
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:15,115
There's Grayskull, and that puts us...

716
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,243
there, but we have to be there.

717
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,997
Twenty metrons forward
if we wanna break through...

718
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,709
the barrier of the
Sorceress' force field.

719
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,420
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I don't understand.

720
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,715
Now, what are you trying to do?

721
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,176
The universe is music, Kevin.

722
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,221
Hey, this is really weird?

723
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,473
Reminds me of
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

724
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,476
The part where the pods
started taking over people's bodies.

725
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,978
You don't know who are pods
and who are the bodies.

726
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,940
Shut up. They're psychos, Corrigan.

727
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,693
We've stumbled onto some
loony fringe group here, some kind of cult.

728
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,491
Our guests are arriving.

729
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:35,404
- Gwildor, how much longer?
- I don't know. I don't know.

730
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,823
I'd give all the chalconite
in Fribillian...

731
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,493
if I could only spend two units
with a master song maker.

732
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,461
- You think they don't like us?
- No, they're just lonely.

733
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,963
They miss us.

734
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,132
Go.

735
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,907
He-Man.

736
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,006
What the hell is going on out there,
World War III?

737
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,800
Ain't that your buddies
getting their heads blown off?

738
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,889
Kevin, you know how to use one of these?

739
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,725
Don't let him out of sight.
Guard the key with your life.

740
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,269
If anyone comes near it, blast him.
You understand?

741
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,489
They're killing each other out there.

742
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:07,245
- Is Gwildor ready?
- Not yet. The room's secure.

743
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,498
It sounded like you needed
a woman's touch.

744
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,215
Woman-at-Arms.

745
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,968
Give me the gun, kid.
Come on, give me the gun.

746
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,054
Don't you get it, Lubic?

747
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:28,016
All right, this is for real.
She meant what she said.

748
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,602
- I said give me the gun.
- No.

749
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:35,065
Look, we've come this far.
We're not giving up until they get home.

750
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,901
Look, don't stop, Gwildor, all right?

751
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,863
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.
When this is over, you're going to jail:

752
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,534
Accessory to assault, resisting arrest,
endangering lives.

753
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,831
I guarantee, you and all your buddies.
I'm gonna put you away for 850 years.

754
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,500
What are you looking at, shorty?

755
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,587
Mark my words, Corrigan,
you're going to jail, you hear me?

756
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,298
Yeah, Lubic, I hear you.
Lubic, listen to me.

757
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,509
Lubic...

758
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,520
Just relax, okay?

759
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,898
- All right, Gwildor, you need anything?
- Give me that thing.

760
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,943
Hey. Kevin, stop it.

761
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,492
Watch that gun.
Come on, you're gonna get hurt.

762
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,178
- Mother?
- Yes, darling, it's me.

763
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,138
But the plane...

764
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,099
I'm so sorry
you had to go through that, Julie...

765
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,851
but we had to disappear.

766
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,395
We're doing very important,
very secret work.

767
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,814
Oh, honey, I've missed you so much.

768
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,615
I don't believe it.

769
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,617
Mom.

770
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,785
Listen, darling.

771
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,370
Your friends are tied up
with the work we're doing...

772
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:16,041
and they have something we want.
That shiny metal thing.

773
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,168
With the blinking lights.

774
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,961
Will you get it for us?

775
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:22,964
Charlie!

776
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,218
Charlie!

777
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,060
Moron kid. Watch your arm, pal...

778
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,901
I don't believe it.
I've got a lot of serious work to do.

779
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,402
You're acting like Torktums.

780
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,657
Julie. Where's Julie?

781
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,536
- I...
- Kevin, you won't believe this.

782
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,288
- They're alive.
- What's the matter? Where were you?

783
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,711
Julie.

784
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,630
Julie!

785
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,757
The key. The key.

786
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,017
Thank you, my darling.

787
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,312
No!

788
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:24,276
- Julie!
- No!

789
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,694
- No.
- Julie.

790
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,459
Where are they going?

791
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,381
Teela. He-Man. Hurry.

792
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:49,926
The key.

793
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,596
- That way.
- Bring Gwildor.

794
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,514
Hold them.

795
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,975
Down.

796
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,901
- That woman took the key.
- Let's move.

797
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:11,990
- Gwildor, come on.
- I'm going. I'm going.

798
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,454
Charlie, you got a gun in here?

799
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,748
A gun, a gun. For holdups.

800
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:24,461
- In the front room, under the counter. I got one.
- You got one? Go. Come on. Let's go.

801
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,840
Oh, my God. My store.

802
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,260
- My keyboards.
- Look at this place. Look at those guys.

803
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:35,597
This is an invasion. Give me the gun.

804
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,391
- Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
- All right, all right.

805
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:43,355
- Stay right there.
- No problem.

806
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,276
Police. Nobody move.

807
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,001
Holy shit.

808
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:08,046
I think I'm gonna need some backup.

809
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,098
Ready to transport.

810
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:21,059
I will send the signal to Skeletor.

811
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:41,037
- What's happening?
- Hurry, keep moving.

812
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:45,625
The key. Someone's opening a door.

813
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,585
A very big door.

814
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,879
- Cover your eyes.
- What's that?

815
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,882
- This way, hurry.
- Into the alleyway, hurry.

816
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,011
- Let's go.
- By the Sorceress. Come on.

817
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,222
It's him! It's him!

818
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,209
Contact Evil-Lyn.

819
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:15,048
Evil-Lyn, Skeletor demands a report.

820
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:22,722
I have the key, my lord.

821
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:27,560
The natives are fools.
Weak and easily controlled.

822
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,646
- They are...
- And He-Man?

823
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,191
- He has eluded us.
- That will be all.

824
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,613
Air Centurians, find him.

825
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,747
Come on.

826
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,584
- Hurry.
- Air Centurians.

827
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,128
Down.

828
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:06,224
- Quick, he'll be back.
- All right, let's move. Come on.

829
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:12,564
- Come on.
- They're coming.

830
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,858
- This way.
- Hurry.

831
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,693
Come on.

832
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,320
- On the roof.
- Go, go.

833
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,698
Go. Go.

834
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,789
- They're turning around to come back.
- Keep moving.

835
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:37,172
Gwildor, your grappler, give it to me.

836
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,381
On the roof.

837
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:43,178
Hurry. Go.

838
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:03,698
- Where's He-Man?
- There.

839
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:40,026
No!

840
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,903
Fire.

841
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,616
He must not use that key.

842
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:49,679
Centurian, lead him to me.

843
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,348
What do you say, Gwildor?

844
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:55,184
Any signal from the key?
There's got to be something.

845
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:57,645
Unfortunately, no.

846
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,230
Nothing.

847
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,691
He should be here by now.

848
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:05,361
I'm not worried about He-Man.
He knows how to take care of himself.

849
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:08,698
I'm more worried about getting us
out of here before they find us.

850
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:11,326
I only have two numbers left.

851
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:15,621
Once we get the key back,
we'll be gone within two pretons.

852
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:17,999
I think not, Gwildor.

853
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:31,846
Not the way to treat your beloved ruler.

854
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,391
Throw down your weapons or you die.

855
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,864
Gwildor...

856
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,492
you minute minion...

857
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:56,245
I have you to thank
for all these troubles. Why?

858
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:59,082
I had such grand plans for you.

859
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:04,337
I would never knowingly serve
the lord of Snake Mountain.

860
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:10,468
- Wait till He-Man arrives. He'll see to you.
- Will he?

861
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,347
I expect him at any moment. Take them.

862
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,454
Torktums.

863
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:55,054
He-Man, no! It's a trap!

864
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,224
Julie!

865
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,148
- No.
- He-Man.

866
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:06,357
Kevin?

867
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,355
Stay where you are, He-Man.

868
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:48,274
One more move...

869
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,444
and your friends will not live
to see another day.

870
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,531
It's gonna be all right.

871
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:03,456
I give you a choice.
Return with me to Eternia as my slave...

872
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,791
and save their despicable lives...

873
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:11,506
or perish with them
on this primitive and tasteless planet.

874
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:14,509
Surrender your sword.

875
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,308
He-Man, no.

876
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:28,105
Teela, I have no choice. This is our fight.

877
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:32,735
- I don't want innocent people to die.
- Well said, He-Man.

878
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,238
How noble.

879
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,787
- Take care of them.
- Good journey.

880
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,956
Good journey.

881
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,255
What about them, sir?

882
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,468
Leave them alone.

883
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,221
He-Man is my slave.

884
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,474
As long as I let them live,
he is bound by his word.

885
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,101
Let them rot.

886
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,646
Let them rot.

887
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:17,488
Let me look at her, Kevin.

888
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:21,367
- What's wrong with her?
- This is Skeletor's particular gift.

889
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,161
- Gwildor, we need to get back to Eternia.
- Immediately.

890
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:27,915
There's little chance of that.
The power core's melted down.

891
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:32,378
The tones are erased
from the key's memory.

892
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:37,049
There's no way home. No way.

893
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:57,111
Here. Cover her with this. Teela.

894
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,946
She's burning up.

895
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,782
We've got to get her water.
There's a fountain down below.

896
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,160
- Good.
- Up.

897
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:12,543
Okay, move out, let's go.

898
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,422
- I'll take the west perimeter.
- Unit 3, keep coming from there.

899
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,840
Okay, Lubic.

900
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:20,343
- Where's the army?
- Will you shut up!

901
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:25,139
They were here, I'm telling you.
It was the damnedest thing you ever saw.

902
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,933
- Everybody, follow me.
- Let's go, guys.

903
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,149
Let me see this.

904
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,283
Oh, my God.

905
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,793
- What's gonna happen to her?
- The poison's already in her blood, Kevin.

906
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,463
- The wound will keep growing...
- Only our Sorceress can heal her now.

907
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,839
I'm sorry, Kevin.

908
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:05,638
Look, don't be sorry,
just find a way to get us back, okay?

909
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:09,517
I mean, there's got to be a way.

910
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,061
Isn't there?

911
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:16,982
Gwildor?

912
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,654
No.

913
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,490
You see, Kevin...

914
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:29,078
opening a dimensional door
is relatively easy.

915
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,789
But the tones, Kevin...

916
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,167
the tones that were stored
in this Cosmic Key...

917
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:37,253
were completely erased.

918
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:39,422
Skeletor knew what he was doing.

919
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:43,092
Even if I could fix it,
we could search for a thousand years...

920
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,595
and never find the tones
that will take us home.

921
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:48,639
But wait a minute. The tones.

922
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:52,935
You mean the melody the key played
every time we pressed the red button?

923
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:57,815
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

924
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,775
What is it, Kevin?

925
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:07,032
God, I wish that thing would shut up.

926
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:13,164
Thanks. Okay.

927
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,925
Wait a minute, I've got it.

928
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,683
That's it. How did you do that?

929
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:38,522
I don't know, I just... if I hear a tune a
couple of times, I can usually remember it.

930
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,192
It had a good hook.
I was going to use it in one of my songs.

931
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,485
Songs?

932
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:45,070
Why didn't you tell me
you were a song maker?

933
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:49,700
Are you a master? Yes, you are.
I know that.

934
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:56,081
That's why the fates brought us here.
The final chord, Kevin.

935
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:59,210
Twenty metrons poleward.

936
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,421
Pull it out of the air for us.

937
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,262
You've got the wrong song maker, Gwildor.

938
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:14,141
All right, I'm just a stupid keyboard
player in a high school band.

939
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,518
There's a million of me.

940
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,233
Only one of you, Kevin.

941
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,152
Only one of anybody.

942
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:29,490
Listen to me, boy.

943
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,367
In half a chromon...

944
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:34,078
we're not going to have a sorceress
to go home to.

945
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:37,873
So if you know how to do something
with that thing, then you do it.

946
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:44,880
Gwildor, Kevin knows the tones.
Can you get us home or can't you?

947
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,511
Yes.

948
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,389
Yes, I think I can.

949
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:56,767
I need a few things.

950
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:59,228
A bossonic tesseract.

951
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,314
- Right here.
- An octode rectifier.

952
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,233
I have an octode rectifier.

953
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,820
- And something to play the tones on.
- I'll get a keyboard from Charlie's.

954
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:12,074
- Look, take care of her.
- I will.

955
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:41,770
I win.

956
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:45,983
How long?

957
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:51,572
- Half a preton until moonrise.
- Do you hear, Sorceress?

958
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,366
The final moment has come.

959
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:56,869
All the forces of Grayskull...

960
01:21:57,037 --> 01:22:00,706
all the powers of the universe
will be vested in me.

961
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:06,462
Me. And you will cease to exist.

962
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:12,176
- It is not too late to undo this madness.
- Madness?

963
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:17,640
I demand the destitution,
shame and loneliness of scorn.

964
01:22:17,807 --> 01:22:20,601
It is my destiny. It is my right.

965
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:26,565
- Nothing will deter me from it.
- Men who crave power...

966
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:30,319
look back over the mistakes
of their lives...

967
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:35,115
pile them all together
and call it destiny.

968
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:43,999
Thank you for that bit of philosophy,
Sorceress. Here is my response.

969
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,047
Yes, Sorceress.

970
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,382
The sword of Grayskull.

971
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,344
Mine.

972
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:06,063
Now and forever.

973
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,028
Your champion.

974
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,834
Witness this moment, He-Man.

975
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,545
This moment
when the powers of Grayskull...

976
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,839
will become mine for eternity.

977
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:36,552
Our lifelong battle is ending at last
in the only way it could.

978
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,763
Holosphere standing by.

979
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:43,017
When the Great Eye opens...

980
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:47,438
the people of Eternia
shall see you kneeling to me...

981
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:49,273
just before you die.

982
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,446
- I'll never kneel to you.
- Yes, you will. Yes, you will.

983
01:23:55,613 --> 01:24:01,702
Or I shall wreak
unforgettable harm upon you.

984
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,600
Lubic, let me drive you home
so you can get a little rest?

985
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,519
I was in Korea.
I never saw anything like this.

986
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:33,233
- That's him. That's him.
- Not again.

987
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,819
- Come on, Lubic.
- Come on, we're moving in.

988
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,877
I got it.

989
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,962
- How is she?
- The same, Kevin.

990
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:56,507
Okay, this should give us
the tones we need.

991
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,133
How?

992
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:59,510
Just press the keys.

993
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,679
Keys? What keys?

994
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,515
Oh, no, no, no. Here.

995
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,270
Excellent.

996
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,612
Wonderful.

997
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,740
You never told me you had sonic keys
in this world.

998
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,325
I just hope it helps, Gwildor.

999
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:26,203
- Thank you, Kevin.
- It's okay.

1000
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,417
I'll have this ready in a preton.

1001
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,755
Kevin, please don't leave me.

1002
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:40,425
I promise you, Julie...

1003
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:44,138
I'll never leave you.

1004
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:46,723
Never.

1005
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,480
I love you.

1006
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,494
Enough.

1007
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:13,750
Where is your strength? Where has it gone?

1008
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:19,256
Look at your precious Sorceress.
An old crone. Weak. Withering.

1009
01:26:19,799 --> 01:26:21,341
Dying.

1010
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:25,179
Are you ready to kneel now...

1011
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,264
proud warrior?

1012
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,474
The moon rises to its apex.

1013
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,813
Do you hear?

1014
01:26:37,942 --> 01:26:40,944
The alpha and the omega.

1015
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:43,739
Death and rebirth...

1016
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:47,075
and as you die...

1017
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:53,207
so will I be reborn.

1018
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:05,552
What are they doing over there?
We've gotta stop this fast.

1019
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,304
- Okay.
- No.

1020
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:10,599
Stay here and cover me. Spread out.

1021
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:13,518
- And wait for my signal.
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:15,979
These guys are mine.

1023
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,901
People of Eternia.

1024
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:25,739
I stand before the Great
Eye of the Galaxy...

1025
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:28,575
chosen by destiny...

1026
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,995
to receive the powers of Grayskull.

1027
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:36,541
This inevitable moment will transpire
before your eyes...

1028
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:40,671
even as He-Man himself
bears witness to it.

1029
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:41,964
The Eye opens.

1030
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:47,094
Now, I, Skeletor...

1031
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:51,473
am Master of the Universe.

1032
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,285
Yes.

1033
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,955
I feel it.

1034
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:19,376
The power fills me.

1035
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,336
Yes.

1036
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:25,048
I feel the universe within me.

1037
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:29,511
I am... I am a part of the cosmos.

1038
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,555
Its energy flows...

1039
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,974
flows through me.

1040
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:39,354
Of what consequence are you now?

1041
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:41,690
This planet, these people...

1042
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:46,862
they are nothing to me.
The universe is power.

1043
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:50,240
Pure, unstoppable power.

1044
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:54,786
And I am that force. I am that power.

1045
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,790
Kneel before your master.

1046
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,669
Fool.

1047
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,465
You are no longer my equal.

1048
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:09,009
I am more than man.

1049
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:11,386
More than life.

1050
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:13,513
I am...

1051
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,767
a god.

1052
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,331
Now...

1053
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,167
you will...

1054
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:43,877
kneel!

1055
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,340
Kneel!

1056
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:52,886
- Are you ready, Kevin?
- Yeah.

1057
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,890
I'm going to set the power. Now, here goes.

1058
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:06,358
Now, Kevin, now.

1059
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:17,411
Freeze. Nobody move.
You're all under arrest.

1060
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,080
Throw down your weapons and
place your hands on your heads.

1061
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,417
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Lubic, you don't understand.

1062
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:26,461
- We've gotta get back.
- Nobody's going anywhere!

1063
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,095
Where are they?

1064
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:39,474
Where are your friends now?

1065
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:43,603
Tell me about
the loneliness of good, He-Man.

1066
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:48,817
Is it equal to the loneliness of evil?

1067
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:15,260
- Holy shit.
- We did it.

1068
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:18,722
- Gwildor, get down.
- Destroy them.

1069
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,932
Take cover!

1070
01:31:28,774 --> 01:31:31,359
- You promised not to hurt them.
- I lied.

1071
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:34,446
Farewell, He-Man.

1072
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,408
Block him.

1073
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:42,996
Get him.

1074
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,832
Give He-Man some cover action.
Kevin, watch the rear.

1075
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,043
You. Watch the forward position.

1076
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,421
Will somebody tell me
what's going on around here?

1077
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:57,219
- I feel like I'm in The Twilight Zone.
- Lubic, this is for real. Just get down.

1078
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:02,140
Hey. Nobody takes pot-shots at Lubic.

1079
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:05,435
All right, you wanna play games?
Then let's play.

1080
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:10,774
Come on, you mother...

1081
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,576
No. Don't kill him. I want him alive.

1082
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:14,045
You cannot hide from me.

1083
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:46,369
- Karg, prepare the battle station.
- Surely you won't leave with Skeletor still...

1084
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:50,040
Yeah. Warlord, let's go.

1085
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,042
Signal the retreat.

1086
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,179
No.

1087
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,691
I have the power!

1088
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,237
You.

1089
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:25,784
You will no longer stand between me
and my destiny.

1090
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:30,330
But I will.
I told you it was always between us.

1091
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:34,167
I ache to smash you out of existence.

1092
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:38,421
To drive your cursed face
from my memory forever.

1093
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:43,301
- Enough talk.
- Yes. Let this be our final battle.

1094
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,027
Skeletor.

1095
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:49,534
- It's over.
- Yes.

1096
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:53,371
For you.

1097
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:15,810
No! No!

1098
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,496
He did it. He-Man!

1099
01:36:34,663 --> 01:36:36,915
- Victory!
- Victory!

1100
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,383
Victory.

1101
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,137
Well, Lubic, look at you.

1102
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:55,642
- So you're really gonna stay here?
- Are you kidding? Why would I go back?

1103
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:59,145
And look what I got here. I got a castle.

1104
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:02,607
I got a view, I got clean air,
I got a beautiful woman.

1105
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:06,402
Some kind of retirement?

1106
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:18,331
Julie, keep this with you
and Eternia will always be near.

1107
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:22,752
Thank you.

1108
01:37:25,047 --> 01:37:27,507
I guess this is really goodbye?

1109
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:30,260
He-Man...

1110
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:32,679
Teela, Man-At-Arms.

1111
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,765
Don't. Don't say goodbye.

1112
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:39,102
Say, "Good journey."

1113
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:43,773
There's an old Eternian saying:

1114
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,650
"Live the journey...

1115
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:48,528
for every destination
is but a doorway to another."

1116
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:52,489
Good journey.

1117
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:07,046
Take care, Julie.

1118
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:10,800
- You look after her, now.
- I will.

1119
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,553
Activate the doorway, Gwildor.

1120
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:17,473
Are you sure you don't wanna go back
in your planet's history?

1121
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:20,435
I could take you back in time
to the past or future.

1122
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:23,229
No. Look, Gwildor, that's okay.
Just send us home.

1123
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:25,648
We better get home, Gwildor.

1124
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:44,083
- Good journey, Julie.
- Good journey, Gwildor.

1125
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:52,383
Good journey.

1126
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:03,102
Gwildor. Wait. Send us back...

1127
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:50,692
Mom, Dad, hi.

1128
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:53,486
- You're up bright and early.
- You're all right.

1129
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,196
What's this all about?

1130
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:57,949
I love you both so much.
I don't ever want to lose you.

1131
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,743
We're just going away for the day.
We'll be back tonight.

1132
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:02,453
No.

1133
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:05,915
I changed my mind.
I do wanna go to the beach with you today.

1134
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,542
Don't go to Catalina, okay?

1135
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:12,255
- Don't be silly, honey. Stay home and study.
- Mom, Dad, please.

1136
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:14,841
Don't get on that plane today.

1137
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:16,843
I have a terrible feeling.

1138
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:20,096
Julie, your father's an excellent pilot.
It's a short trip.

1139
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:21,723
No.

1140
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,311
- Julie. Julie, put those keys back.
- I love you.

1141
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:30,815
Julie, where are you going?
Come back here.

1142
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:37,113
- Julie.
- Kevin.

1143
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:46,914
- Don't let your parents get on that plane.
- I've already stopped them.

1144
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,459
Wait a minute.

1145
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:51,794
You know?

1146
01:40:52,254 --> 01:40:53,713
Yeah.

1147
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:56,299
We were there.

1148
01:41:01,513 --> 01:41:03,181
Eternia.

1149
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:17,904
I have the power!

1150
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,900
I'll be back.
