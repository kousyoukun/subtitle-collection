1
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,999
South side, 24 floors,
never been done before

2
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,640
- Which side?
- East, the most difficult

3
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,392
Can you do it, blindfolded?

4
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,512
- Any questions?
- No

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,591
We'll meet tomorrow morning at 6

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,992
Kamel

7
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,872
Kamel, Kamel

8
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,759
Hurry up

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,917
Come on, get down quickly

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,275
- Do you know what time it is?
- They're gonna climb the Bleuets

11
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,636
- Get out of here!
- I swear that I saw them, come on

12
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,869
Give me 2 seconds

13
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,237
It's gonna be deadly

14
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,032
Hello? Police?

15
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,392
I can't believe it!

16
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,717
- I just went for a drink
- I don't believe you at all

17
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,791
Don't believe me then

18
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,949
You were with your
redheaded bimbo, weren't you?

19
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,473
What redheaded bimbo?

20
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,759
Leave me alone!

21
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,433
- This is class
- This is really a deadly stunt

22
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,869
This isn't something
that I'd do everyday though

23
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,549
- Here comes the cavalry
- They're always late anyway

24
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,039
Let's split

25
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,759
Move it, move it, go, go, go

26
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,635
Hurry up you guys, move it

27
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,073
Let's nail them, go, go,
they won't get us this time

28
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,633
Bring them to me, come on, go, go go,
hurry, let's nail them this time

29
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,992
Clear off you kids,
this is a police operation

30
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,116
An operation? It looks more like a comedy

31
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,713
Get lost before I arrest you

32
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,268
Isn't it too much for you?
Don't you want to call for back-up?

33
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,032
Hey kiddo, do you want
me to throw you in jail?

34
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,394
Let's hit the road my friend

35
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,914
I can't have any rest,
same story every morning

36
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,997
They're here, hurry up guys

37
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,834
Let's move, Quickly

38
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:08,713
Come on guys, move it, go, go, go

39
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,279
Let's go

40
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,758
Good morning to you, chief

41
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,317
That does it! I don't
like to be taken for an idiot

42
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,991
Everybody gather up for a briefing

43
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,558
Recap, YA-MA-KA-SSl

44
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,392
7 scoundrels are making us look like fools

45
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,552
We'll show them how wrong
they are, I'll make the introductions

46
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,839
Dadjacan, known as Zicmu, to start with

47
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,395
What is it now?

48
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,158
Your son is making
a lot of noise on the balcony

49
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,959
- Go in, then
- Excuse us, we have to go in

50
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,275
Open up, police

51
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,396
I warn you, we're going in, on 3

52
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,074
One, two, three

53
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,037
No, don't do that, kid, our mistake

54
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,918
You were making some noise, that's all

55
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,758
No!

56
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,718
What a hitch!

57
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,357
That wasn't a hitch but a damned stupidity

58
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,398
The next one who falls for this
little prank will be out of here

59
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,034
Next

60
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,192
Jean-Michel Lucas called Tango,
the local Fred Astaire

61
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,317
You'll see the mess,
and it's always by the same guy

62
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,790
- What's going on here?
- Good morning, Miss Boutin

63
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,791
- What's got into you?
- I assure you, madam...

64
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,271
Miss, go back to work,
we've wasted enough time

65
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,070
If I catch this one,
he won't be dancing for long

66
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,197
Now, buckle up,
I present to you Abdou N'Goto

67
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,829
Alias Rocket, he's no bright spark
but a "rocket" nonetheless

68
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,556
Stop, never mind

69
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,990
We'll have him next time

70
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,276
Don't worry, you'll get your chance

71
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,239
The day I get him,
he'll be dead meat, believe me

72
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,077
Here's someone who
always manages to slip away

73
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,754
Bruno Duris known as "the spider"

74
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,715
"The spider"

75
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,756
- Stop, you're gonna wrinkle my dress
- Forgive me

76
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,592
- Can I walk you to work?
- I'll think about it, go go

77
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,556
Easy, there's much worse
Malik N'Diaye, la Belette

78
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,876
Look here, girls

79
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,676
Look at this, girls

80
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,789
What are you doing?
Bring back the trampoline

81
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,598
Stop fooling around

82
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,272
Pathetic

83
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,400
You won't laugh
with the next guy "Baseball"

84
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,514
His real name is Oliver Chen

85
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,353
No! Help! Thief! Help!

86
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,152
No, this can't be true

87
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,629
- Soon, they'll be heroes
- They're not criminals neither

88
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,199
Buildings were not made to be climbed

89
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,555
I know, but they didn't steal, they didn't kill

90
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,632
- They're just having fun
- Do you think we're having fun here?

91
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,150
There is enough mess in the city and for
exercising, let them play football like everybody

92
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,832
- Chief...
- Enough Asmine

93
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,471
Our job is to uphold the law and the
law doesn't allow climbing the buildings

94
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,189
and waking people up at 6 in the morning
and make fun of the law enforcing agents

95
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,157
Is that clear?

96
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,759
Finally, Bana Alias sitting bull

97
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,591
Sitting bull, hurry up, you're the last one

98
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,357
One day, he's gonna fall, and I'll watch

99
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,510
That's it, the Japanese
have their 7 Samurais

100
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,309
The Americans, the 7 mercenaries
and we have the 7 damned nuisances

101
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,073
You have to lock them
and teach them the city is no zoo

102
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,071
If nothing happens by the end of the week

103
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,392
I'll call the special force,
and by Monday, it's gonna be a safari

104
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,913
Let's roll

105
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,554
Hey cousin, what brings you here?

106
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,756
- Good news?
- Good and bad

107
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,149
- You were fired?
- Not yet

108
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,958
What's the good news then?

109
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,556
- That I'm off duty, I'm here as a friend
- You got me worried

110
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,276
We had a briefing at the PD, you've got a
huge fiile and you're in my boss's bad books

111
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,032
It's rather flattering

112
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,835
Anyway, you've got
to lay low for some time

113
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,990
Why don't you go to the Alps?

114
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,596
Chalet, sugar muffins,
mountaineering all day long?

115
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,677
Why are they on our back? We've not asking
for anything, we're not bothering anyone

116
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,479
Yes you are, your little circus
doesn't please everyone

117
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,109
- Did you think of the parents?
- What parents?

118
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,920
The youngsters look up
to you and want to imitate you

119
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,036
The youngsters look up
to you and want to imitate you

120
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,031
It's fun to challenge
the cops and live like a rebel

121
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,669
But you are well trained
and they're not, they might get killed

122
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,398
What will you do then?

123
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,798
I'm just a small-time inspector

124
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,956
My decision-making power is small and yet
even smaller considering that I'm a foreigner

125
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,952
So, if you don't help me,
I won't be able to do anything for you

126
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,312
Tonight, mom is cooking chicken
combo, how about joining us?

127
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,752
Ifyour mom is doing it...

128
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,520
Yamakasi!

129
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,396
Yamakasi!

130
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,358
Djamel, let's play Yamakasi

131
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,635
Come on, we're playing Yamakasi

132
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,755
Come Djamel

133
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,038
- I can't, because of my heart
- It's just a story to evade gym

134
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,395
- Are you a wimp or what?
- I have no right

135
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,277
Do you need permission to piss too?

136
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,035
Do you want to be a coward?
Climb up here, show us what you can do

137
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,429
Show us you're a real Yamakasi, come on

138
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,637
- Everybody's watching
- You're not shy, come on

139
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,996
Prove you're a real Yamakasi

140
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,714
Let's encourage him, come on Djamel

141
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,429
Don't stop,
show us you're a real Yamakasi

142
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,193
Come on, climb up

143
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,870
Come on, you're almost there

144
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,909
Don't wimp out, you made it

145
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,436
Come on, come on Djamel

146
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,272
Djamel

147
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,994
Djamel!

148
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,792
No, Djamel!

149
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,073
Djamel?

150
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,516
- Hello?
- Mrs. Hadj?

151
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,036
It's Mrs. Gurrin
from school, it's about Djamel

152
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,275
Djamel? Aila, come quick, it's Djamel

153
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,475
Hello?

154
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,759
Good morning, it's... it's gonna be okay

155
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,712
It's just a little more serious than we thought

156
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,994
I warned you
that he shouldn't make any efforts

157
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,036
I know, but he has to go to school

158
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,633
Yes, sure, school, yes

159
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,359
What's gonna happen now?
What are we gonna do?

160
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,831
We have 24 hours
to made a transplant and...

161
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,349
He is on a waiting list, no?
You said so yourself

162
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,829
Yes, yes, sure,
but it's a bit more complicated than this

163
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,151
He's on a top priority list,
but we need a donor

164
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,196
At the right time, at the right place

165
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,713
This list changes every hour

166
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,553
What can we do now?
Is there nothing we can do?

167
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,709
Come with me!

168
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,276
That's what I was afraid of

169
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,112
There's nothing available in France

170
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,473
What are we gonna do?

171
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,312
Nothing much, just wait

172
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,597
An organ might get to us at the last minute

173
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,830
Let's cross our fingers

174
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,515
What about...
somewhere else than France?

175
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,875
That's a different story, we need to
go through an intermediate company

176
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,793
We can look

177
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
Bingo! I've got one,
in Switzerland, O negative

178
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,835
Healthy donor,
expected death in a few hours

179
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,070
He's perfect, and there's no option on him

180
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,309
What does that mean?

181
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,790
He's not reserved, he's somehow available

182
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,599
Or rather, he will be, in a couple of hours

183
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,320
So, what do we have to do,
to get this... option?

184
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,311
Officially, nothing

185
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,069
Unofficially, and due to the urgency
of the situation I could try to call them

186
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,232
Okay, do it, we agree

187
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,675
Have you any idea,
how much such a transfer will cost?

188
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,159
No

189
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,630
About 400 thousand francs

190
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,794
We don't have that kind of money, sir

191
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,072
Ask your neighbors, your relatives

192
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,152
If everyone pitches in,
it could be done real quick

193
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,433
What about social security?

194
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,273
It will cover the
transplant here in the hospital

195
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,119
The rest is illegal, so it can't be covered

196
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,754
To help you, I'm gonna take the risk, for you

197
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,069
Here you are, I've made a mark on him

198
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,720
He's reserved

199
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,709
He's reserved

200
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,832
Little Djamel has
a new heart waiting for him

201
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,277
You have until noon
tomorrow, it's your play now

202
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,749
Do you want to get us all killed?

203
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,114
Music never killed anybody...

204
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,715
Turn it down a little bit, but I've been at the
milling machine all day, my head is about to blow

205
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,756
- Take an aspirin then
- I already have, you fool

206
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,549
- Turn the music down
- You really make me sad, Belette

207
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,794
- So, my friends are cool, aren't they?
- Yes

208
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,632
- Watch it!
- Excuse-me, don't move

209
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,269
- I'll get a sponge
- Get a mop while you're at it

210
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,997
Are these your diet pills?

211
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,868
No, they're for my asthma
I should take them with the meals

212
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,871
Are you in the middle now?

213
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,873
I bought 2 kilos of lemon,
but they just disappeared

214
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,235
Did any of you see...

215
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,712
Rocket, you're heavy, I'm training here

216
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,394
So, use bananas,
we have plenty in the fridge

217
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,233
You run fast, man,
but you still need to train more

218
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,232
- Aren't you coming in?
- Yes, yes

219
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,195
Is there a problem?

220
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,955
Yes, a kid had a bad fall
in school today, little Djamel

221
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,359
Who lives across the street,
do you know him?

222
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,919
Yes, it's Aila's brother

223
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,878
He's in the intensive care
unit and his condition is serious

224
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,315
- Do you know what happened?
- No

225
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,396
He was climbing a tree in his school yard,
he was playing the big guy's game

226
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,836
Vincent, it's good to see you home

227
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,876
How come we never
get to see you in uniform?

228
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,949
I work in the office

229
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,919
So what?
Can't you look nice in an office?

230
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,479
When we make food
for you it's no peanuts, yes?

231
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,274
We're not kids

232
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,839
Have you done it, Belette?

233
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,629
Yes, we climbed the eastern side
of the Bleuets in less than 1 0 minutes

234
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,115
Like always, I was the fastest... Rocket

235
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,270
Rasta Rocket, you are definitely the fastest

236
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,515
No, that was delicious, but I'm full, thank you

237
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,431
Don't they feed you well at the P.D?

238
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,512
How are you supposed to
catch thieves, if you don't scare them?

239
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,316
Fatima, don't do that!

240
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,475
- I don't want them to take away my baby
- Fatima, don't do this, come back

241
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,838
It's no use, no!

242
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,798
Go down underneath, I'll take care of her

243
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,072
Aila

244
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,832
No

245
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,071
Fatima

246
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,158
Mom!

247
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,552
Fatima!

248
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,517
What do you want of me? I don't need
a thing, it's my son who needs help

249
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,320
Fatima, we're gonna sit
and work out a solution for your son

250
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,551
Fatima, we're gonna sit
and work out a solution for your son

251
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,517
Easy! Look at me! Look at me!

252
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,798
There's always a solution Fatima, trust me

253
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,477
We're gonna take care of Djamel

254
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,233
I give you my word for it, Fatima

255
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,076
No!

256
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,798
Are you proud of yourselves?

257
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,552
You truly are nothing but a bunch of bastards

258
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,959
We just saved your mother,
is that a way to treat us?

259
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,830
Ah yes?
And who's gonna save my brother?

260
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,990
You and your spins

261
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,113
Djamel is gonna die and it's your fault

262
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,509
- Come on, relax
- Leave me alone

263
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,520
No way, we never wanted this!

264
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,431
No way, we never wanted this!

265
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,512
We're not hurting anybody,
we're always ready to serve

266
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,556
The other day, we saved
an old lady from being mugged

267
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,551
- Ask Michelin, he was there
- That's true

268
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,471
She didn't even say "Thank you"

269
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,073
Yes, you shouldn't reverse the roles

270
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,593
We might be reckless,
but we're no criminals

271
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,117
- Okay, wait
- We're not irresponsible guys

272
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,553
We never told kids to imitate us

273
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,029
We get up at 6 in the
morning so they won't see us

274
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,997
Don't turn a blind eyes on this

275
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,753
You know very well kids don't wait
for a permission to do something stupid

276
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,398
They spy on us,
then they try it on their own

277
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,835
What do we do then? What's the solution?

278
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,592
- Stop definitely, that's all
- Stop what?

279
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,829
Stop your reckless climbing

280
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,751
And what do you suggest we do instead?

281
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,469
- Steal, burn cars?
- It's not that, don't be a wise guy

282
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,195
I'm being a wise guy?

283
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,838
Are you gonna keep insulting us all night?

284
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,558
You're gonna be sorry
you're not in uniform

285
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,834
You're gonna be sorry
for talking to me like this

286
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,948
Stop it! Haven't we got
enough tragedy for one night?

287
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,348
You want to fight each other?

288
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,320
- What do you want us to do then?
- We're gonna do the only thing to be done

289
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,117
- What do you want us to do then?
- We're gonna do the only thing to be done

290
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,350
We assume our responsibility

291
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,832
What are you doing here? Who let you up?

292
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,549
Sorry, miss,
we're here to see the young Djamel

293
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,518
Visiting hours are over, it's late...

294
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,158
- Come back tomorrow
- It's very important, we need to...

295
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,673
I'm telling you, no way

296
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,228
If the consultant comes,
he'll make a scene, go home

297
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,997
Michelin? It'll only take 5 minutes

298
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,828
Can we come in?

299
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,319
Yes

300
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,109
Cool, did you all come to see me?

301
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,478
Did you really climb the east facade
of the Bleuets?

302
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,788
News travel fast

303
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,997
The cops must have taken it very badly

304
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,116
You can say that again! They were fuming

305
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,510
Fuming chicken! That's a killing!

306
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,990
When I'm older,
can I become a Yamakasi too?

307
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,396
It takes a lot of work, but if you really
want to, when you get out, we'll teach you

308
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,751
You have our word

309
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,479
Where did they come from? I'll call you back

310
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,392
Excuse me, I don't think
you have an appointment

311
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,869
It's an emergency, it's about little Djamel

312
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,871
Oh, I see!

313
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,399
Listen, I don't know what to tell you

314
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,914
Why don't you tell us the truth,
that's a good start

315
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,877
It seems you're willing to let him die

316
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,350
I already took a personal risk,
by putting him up as an option

317
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,510
so I honestly don't know what more I can do

318
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,273
- What's the problem then? Is it money?
- The problem is simple

319
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,794
The hospital cannot
finance the transfer itself

320
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,077
We don't have the right to do it, nor can we
afford it and we're not gonna pay for it ourselves

321
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,832
I just hope you understand

322
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,835
- Who are these people?
- An intermediate company, HTC

323
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,429
Why don't they lend us the money?
We'll pay it back to them each month

324
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,636
It's impossible,
and anyway, even if I wanted to

325
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,915
I would have to consult
with their board of directors

326
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,319
All decisions have
to go through its 7 members

327
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,039
- That makes, 7 phones calls
- I can't just call them

328
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,554
Where there's a will, there is a way

329
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,591
Go ahead, try, it's a simple as a phone call

330
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,275
I just can't, do you see what time it is?

331
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,920
- I cannot call everybody just because...
- Because what?

332
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,036
- Because a kid is gonna die?
- That's not what I meant

333
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,872
- Are those your children?
- Give me that!

334
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,952
- They look very healthy
- Leave that!

335
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,031
Enough of that!
You've got 1 0 seconds to leave my office

336
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,112
And 1 minute to leave the hospital
before I call the cops

337
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,988
You'll have your money!
It will be on your table, tomorrow at noon

338
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,038
They're gonna let a kid die
for money, this is disgusting!

339
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,032
- They deserve a good beating
- That's not a good idea

340
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,237
- Do you have a better one, smart ass?
- Everything is better than this one

341
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
We're in France where
we don't abandon people in need

342
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,353
This might be true in your books
but the reality is different

343
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,830
In real life, the city is a jungle
where a kid with no money can die

344
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,199
Stop it man, easy, we've got to think, we'll
find a way, maybe a bank loan or something

345
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,872
Are you day dreaming? Look at us!

346
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,474
We can't go into a night-club
and you want us to go to a bank?

347
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,554
The only way we can get in is with a gun,
you have one, will you lend it to us?

348
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,320
Give me 2 hours, I'll go by the office
I'll fiill the guys on what's happening

349
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,036
Give me 2 hours, I'll go by the office
I'll fiill the guys on what's happening

350
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,157
We'll put our heads together
for a solution, a legal one, deal?

351
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,119
Listen, you do it your way, by the book
and we'll do it our way, by the heart

352
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,668
The first one
who will save Djamel's life, will win

353
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,320
Just don't do anything stupid, that's all I ask

354
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,753
I'll do my best, you have my word

355
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,512
- Where did you get that?
- From the doctor's office

356
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,630
These are the addresses
of the 7 board members

357
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,357
We're gonna eat them alive!

358
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,759
I don't agree!
Violence doesn't solve anything

359
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,116
You're right, but we're gonna upset them

360
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,395
No, we'll do better than this

361
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,550
We'll tell them a story

362
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,437
Take from the rich, and give it to the poor

363
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,829
- Does this ring a bell?
- Yes, the cartoon movie

364
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,310
- Robin Hood
- It's awesome Rachid's sister has the cassette

365
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,552
- Yes, but still, it's stealing, no?
- Yes, but we're not really stealing

366
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,154
We're gonna give the money back

367
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,471
Shit! But it's big!

368
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,438
I like it! Very much actually!

369
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,239
- It's a stunning idea!
- It's a devilish plan

370
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,198
Yes, we're gonna end up
either in jail or in the hospital

371
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,795
Don't be pessimistic, we all agree, okay?

372
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,359
What do I do?

373
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,754
Wait, I'd like to help little Djamel too

374
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,513
Michelin, you'll stay here,
on stand-by, as a cover

375
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,239
If something goes wrong,
we'll call you for help

376
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,072
Great, yes!

377
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,788
We'll meet at 5 o'clock sharp

378
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,559
What's up inspector? You can't sleep?

379
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,759
Are you crazy?
Do you know what time it is?

380
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,512
Forgive me, I know it's early

381
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,511
If my father sees you, you'll be dead meat

382
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,273
I'm going through something,
it's very important

383
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,033
I wanted to tell you,
if we don't get to see each other again

384
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,157
I know we're gonna
see each other again, but...

385
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,199
I'm not very good
at making love declarations

386
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,830
You're gonna be proud of me

387
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,229
We maybe have found
a way to help little Djamel

388
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,515
But it's gonna take a while

389
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,914
I'm gonna miss work today so I can't clock in

390
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,949
Get out of here, I'll handle it

391
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,877
Let's split into 3 groups, each will made
2 break-ins, 60 thousand francs each

392
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,713
- What if we don't find any cash?
- Jewellery, passports, credit cards

393
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,598
Nothing big, nothing
heavy, and nothing more

394
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,558
We'll meet at 10 o'clock at the last address
and we'll do the last theft together

395
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,189
2 hours per mission,
it's enough time to do well so don't rush

396
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
Observe, act and disappear

397
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,389
- Michelin, don't get away from the phone
- No problem, I have 2 new batteries

398
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,518
5.:30

399
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,872
4th floor

400
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,950
Never mind, it's the kitchen

401
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,392
This is not the time
to eat, let's check there

402
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,233
- Let's go
- No, no, no

403
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,908
We've got 4 hours to save little Djamel,
you go left, I'll go right, go

404
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,520
Call the police

405
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,316
Call the police

406
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,472
Very well, thank you

407
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,596
Good morning, I'd like to see the minister

408
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,033
His excellency is not here today

409
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,078
I'll see his adviser then

410
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,516
I've been told by one of his
relatives that he generally comes early

411
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,239
Indeed, but... do you have an appointment?

412
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,276
This is about a 9 years old
kid who's in the hospital and l...

413
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,793
Excuse-me,
have you got an appointment?

414
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,155
No, but it's an emergency,
ifwe don't do something...

415
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,629
Mr. Adviser doesn't meet with anybody
without an appointment, it's the rule!

416
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,075
I suggest you write him a letter
I'll make sure he gets your request

417
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,912
Forgive me for insisting
but it's an emergency

418
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,036
That's out of the question
sir, I'm absolutely sorry

419
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,432
The adviser is very strict
when it comes to protocol

420
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,794
You're not even listening to what I'm saying

421
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,110
A kid is gonna die
and you talk to me about protocol?

422
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,519
You stay put!

423
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,636
As for you, call the adviser, is that clear?

424
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,280
- What on earth is going on here?
- Sir, I really think...

425
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,271
I'm inspector Asmine, sir

426
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,397
I'm sorry I acted this way
but a kid is gonna die

427
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,516
You're the only one who can save him

428
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,877
I never knew I had all this power

429
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,950
Will you step into my office?

430
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,909
Please, after you

431
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,238
Have a seat

432
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,509
Shit! The guy can really paint

433
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,668
Look how huge it is

434
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,435
They said nothing big, nor heavy
we have to find something else

435
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,152
Shit!

436
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,072
That can't be!

437
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,071
That's unbearable!
It's enough to make you hate music

438
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,831
5 minutes, then we're out of here

439
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,151
- Where did you learn that?
- "Mission lmpossible"

440
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,798
There must be a key somewhere

441
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,518
I know where it is

442
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,478
Wait, 2 seconds
we can't leave this guy uneducated

443
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,193
"Listen to this music,
it is a good as the world's gold"

444
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,836
This story is really surprising, I tell you
and unusual, to say the least

445
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,957
That's why I insisted on coming into
your office for which I do apologize again

446
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,395
No, no, don't apologize, on the contrary

447
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,358
It's a good thing to be reminded as
politicians that we have to serve the voters

448
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,032
and not the other way around

449
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,758
your move honors you

450
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,479
Thank you, do you think we're
gonna be able to do something?

451
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,155
I'll call the military hospital
and see what can be done

452
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,071
Otherwise, I'll call the
air force general commander

453
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,879
And ask for a plane
for this kind of operation

454
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,916
Thank you sir, thanks on behalf of Djamel

455
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,558
You're welcome

456
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,435
Life is beautiful, no?
A big house like this, just for us

457
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,909
You scared the shit out of us

458
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,599
You really are a case

459
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,750
I looked around,
the place is full of alarm systems

460
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,751
Don't worry, I'm an electronics whiz

461
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,791
- Piece of cake!
- It's too easy, if you ask me

462
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,154
Too heavy!

463
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,720
- Too fragile
- Too cool

464
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:03,993
- Too fragile
- Too cool

465
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,272
- Oh no!
- Oh shit!

466
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,873
Dogs!

467
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,192
They are closing in
on us from both sides

468
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,759
What do we do? What do we do?

469
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,276
Let them come,
out of the way, a little more

470
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,509
Now!

471
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,113
I'll never pet another dog again

472
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,316
I told you to be alert at all times

473
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,515
30 million pet friends, my eye!

474
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,158
They certainly are not on the list

475
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,151
Anyway, I hope the
others have done well

476
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,912
Because we're not
even close to what we need

477
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,629
We'll make up for that on the next hit
because I'm not going back in here

478
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,072
Aila, it's me, Vincent

479
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,354
Yes?

480
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,398
Listen, I've got good news

481
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,391
I went to see the
minister's adviser in person

482
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,837
And he was very sensitive
to our story, to Djamel's story

483
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,595
He promised to intervene during the day
I'm waiting to hear from him any minute now

484
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,715
That's great, no?

485
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,554
Yes, that's good, but...
what exactly is he gonna do?

486
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,513
He's gonna put a military plane at our disposal
and some men, the whole shebang, Aila?

487
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,791
Are you telling me they're gonna
go through all this trouble for Djamel?

488
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,555
Yes, I assure you, I met him, he was
deeply concerned, I'm not kidding

489
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,279
- Do you doubt my words?
- No, no

490
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,999
I have no doubts about
you but about everyone else

491
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,791
Hold on Aila, a few more hours,
and Djamel will be saved

492
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,677
Everything is going well,
trust me, you just have to believe it

493
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,638
- Asmine! What's the story?
- Can I call you back?

494
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,359
Where do you think you are, Asmine?
You're a cop, not a social worker

495
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,716
You're not paid to harass good people
but to protect them, don't you get that?

496
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,028
- Harass? But..
- No buts

497
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,588
I was just off the phone
with the minister's adviser

498
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,996
What's got into you to insult the minister's
adviser in his own office? Are you crazy or what?

499
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,832
- But I didn't insult him at all
- That's not what he's saying

500
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,310
He says you attacked the security man,
you forced your way into his office...

501
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,231
and you told him some
cock-and-bull story for an hour

502
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,835
- That's not true, I only asked him...
- We don't care about what you asked

503
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,319
The problem is not the truth, Asmine

504
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,914
It's about dealing
with the shit we face all day long

505
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,036
Frankly, I don't understand a thing

506
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,716
- Don't be naive! It's annoying
- At least, listen, a kid's life is at stake

507
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,155
So what? We're cops, Asmine

508
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,119
We have no mercy and we are not "Doctors
without frontiers", our job is to obey the orders

509
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,156
If a kid dies, that's too bad,
but it's not our problem

510
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,550
So, obey, Asmine, don't think

511
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,189
We are the base, the cement
and cement doesn't think

512
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,712
Everyone does his job, so the sheep
are well protected, it is easy to understand

513
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,678
Handle this case, for a change

514
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,993
What are you doing?
Are you gonna operate on him?

515
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,789
Everything is fine, miss, that's just
the routine, we have to move Djamel

516
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,154
- he can't stay in there
- Why not?

517
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,879
There are other patients, we need the space,
we're gonna leave him here for now

518
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,279
In the hall?

519
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,273
It's only temporary, and it won't change
a thing, we'll watch him just as well

520
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,510
That's disgusting!
You're acting as if he were dead!

521
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,195
Dead people are taken
to the morgue, it's the sick ward

522
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,919
There are only 5 of us in this ward

523
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,956
And they just brought
2 severally wounded

524
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,268
We don't know where to put them

525
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,510
Because my little
brother isn't sick enough, right?

526
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,512
We can't do anything
for him for the moment

527
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,556
So we're gonna take care
of the ones we can treat

528
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,234
And when it comes
to him, we will, believe us

529
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,394
Now the best thing you can do
is to be calm and stay next to him

530
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,310
Down boys, down

531
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,113
- Good morning sir, police
- Come in, come in

532
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,158
- You're here for the burglary, is that it?
- Exactly

533
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,358
They didn't get to take much,
with the 2 dogs, they didn't have much time

534
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,075
They went through here,
they neutralized the alarm

535
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,517
Then straight to the living room

536
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,716
What makes you say
they were more than one?

537
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,993
This

538
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,351
I have 8 of them all around the house

539
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,319
I got the burglars from every angle, look

540
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,912
You're very well equipped

541
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,753
After the 5th burglary, I've got enough

542
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,193
What do you do for a living?

543
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,033
I'm a surgeon, so I'm never here

544
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,238
- Anyway, they are quite nimble
- They might be from the circus, right?

545
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,148
- May l?
- Yes

546
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,350
Ask command center if such
burglaries were reported this morning

547
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,908
- Coffee?
- Yes, thank you

548
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,515
Yes, me too... can I connect my device?

549
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,433
- There's a plug on the wall, here
- Thank you

550
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,473
Shit, you've got a hell of an intuition

551
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,152
Do you know how
many burglaries I have?

552
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,516
- 4 since 6 o'clock this morning
- Yes, at least for the moment

553
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,671
Try finding a link between the victims!
Anything! A sports club, a car brand, anything

554
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,276
I've got a simple one, they're all doctors

555
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,952
I thought so

556
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,712
So, any progress?

557
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,997
Not bad, yes

558
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,198
- Does the name Henri Picard ring a bell?
- Yes, he's a colleague

559
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,837
Pierre Gautier, Jacques Bernier

560
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,553
We are part of the
same board of directors

561
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,837
You are 7 directors
for the same company

562
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,879
Yes, although we never see the 7th director,
he's the health minister's adviser, so...

563
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,917
- Have you got a printer?
- Three

564
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,792
We must warn the rest,
that they're gonna have a visit

565
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,711
I'll take care of the minister's adviser

566
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,149
Goodbye sir

567
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,356
The minister is beyond our jurisdiction, we
should hand over the case to the Paris police

568
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,589
Don't worry, I'll take care of it

569
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,672
Do you think it's the best thing
to do, under those circumstances?

570
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,990
Your morning rendez-vous, wasn't it...?

571
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,437
Listen pal, you're not here to think, so act

572
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,394
- Yes, what is it?
- This is the police, madam

573
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,150
Sorry to bother you madam,
we are tracking a bunch of house burglars

574
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,629
Our information lead us to believe
they're gonna try to break in here

575
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,438
Really? Oh my God! That's incredible!

576
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,034
Don't panic, we're here,
nothing can happen to you

577
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,556
- Can we have a look around?
- Yes, please do, come in

578
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,597
- That's a beautiful painting
- It's a Klimt

579
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,871
- Can we take a look around?
- Yes, yes, go ahead

580
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,352
There's nothing here

581
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,956
- Do you think they were already here?
- No but prevention is better than cure

582
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,394
When we do our job

583
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,354
We do it all the way

584
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:14,197
As it seems, there's no one here,
and all is well, I said "it seems"

585
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,318
But we have to be careful
when it comes to these guys

586
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,879
At the rate they're
carrying out their burglaries

587
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,394
They must have gotten
a fortune by now, believe me

588
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,271
- Are they dangerous?
- We never know, madam

589
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,471
So, did you search the house?

590
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,630
From top to bottom,
you can sleep peacefully

591
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,712
- Madam
- But what if they come anyway?

592
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,473
Don't worry,
we have the building surrounded

593
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,391
They won't be able
to get within 10 meters

594
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,752
Not even a mouse can get through

595
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,680
Thank you, I already feel reassured

596
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,275
You're welcome,
it's only normal, that's our job, madam

597
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,388
Give me 10 minutes with her, I'll pack
her up, lay her down and make her shout

598
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,155
Oh my God! My "Klimt",
they took my "Klimt"

599
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,358
- What "Klimt"? What is it?
- Look behind you

600
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,992
- Andre, did you see them?
- No, no, nothing to report

601
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,718
- My "Klimt"
- Calm down

602
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,836
They were here, they ran away

603
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,596
- They're gonna be back
- Calm down, calm down

604
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,912
What the...

605
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,871
Andre, they're on the roof, call for back up

606
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,631
Go, go!

607
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,675
Shit! You, there, there, move, quick

608
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,999
Shit, we're caught!

609
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,637
Are you crazy?

610
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,072
They're here

611
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,476
To the staircase, the staircase A

612
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,076
Quick! Inside the building

613
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,990
They're here! This way!

614
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,636
Damn! They're not willing to let go

615
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,911
They're here

616
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,435
- Don't move
- This is the police, don't move, easy

617
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,114
Come on, come here I said

618
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,839
- Easy
- That's good, come on, come now

619
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,434
I think you don't have a plan neither

620
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,116
Hands over your head, hands up,
I said, you made me run!

621
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,077
Hands up

622
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,631
Yes

623
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,751
Turn

624
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,513
- One
- What are you... stop!

625
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,635
- Two
- Don't be fools!

626
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,512
- Three
- Stop! Stop!

627
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,079
Don't be...

628
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,111
Damn fools!

629
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,631
I'm not going after them

630
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,150
Ludo, what on earth...

631
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,712
Ludo?

632
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,472
I know, I'll finish my homework
and clean my room, I promise

633
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,357
- We'll go the other way
- Yes, yes, the other way

634
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,476
The crazy fools!

635
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,956
It's very nice of you
to come, he'll be glad to see you

636
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,638
They're here, nearby, I saw them

637
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,712
Who Djamel? Who's here?

638
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,429
The spirits...
I know they watch over me

639
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,594
Was anybody hurt?

640
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,230
Not for the moment, knock on wood

641
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,235
- So, how are things coming your way?
- Slowly

642
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,471
You still have over one hour and a half, maybe
you should get busy instead of watching us

643
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,516
You've done enough
foolishness for one day?

644
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,114
And what did you do today?
Did you see your minister?

645
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,270
- Yes, I did
- So?

646
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,793
I'm making progress

647
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,433
- Let's go!
- I can't let you do this

648
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,839
I'm a cop,
you seem to have forgotten this

649
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,309
- You can always change careers
- But this means something for me

650
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,118
I'm fighting hard
for the laws and values...

651
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,556
And we are fighting
for Djamel, just for Djamel

652
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,471
So let us through,
we've got a date for noon

653
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,950
But if you go through this street now
the cops will turn up, shoot at you

654
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,429
And send you home in a
coffin, is that what you want?

655
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,748
He thinks he's Clint Eastwood

656
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,310
Shut up Rocket
or I smash your face in, is that clear?

657
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,038
How can he talk to me this way?

658
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,474
You don't understand

659
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,154
On one side, you have friendship,
the law on the other

660
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,516
If I brush aside my beliefs,
I'll be nothing, do you understand?

661
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,191
Our beliefs make us stand on end and
allow us to respect ourselves, understand?

662
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,793
It's the same for us, Vincent

663
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,236
We feel that a kid's life should not depend
on the unwillingness of some loaded doctors

664
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,756
So we're gonna go through
with our idea or we'll be nothing

665
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,875
And we'll blame ourselves
for the rest of our lives

666
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,110
You don't have to steal for that

667
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,919
Enough with your solutions!
Look at your watch Vincent

668
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,513
We run into Aila
and her mother every day

669
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,390
Do you want us to look down
the next time we see them?

670
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,316
I'm coming

671
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,318
- What can I do for you?
- It's a burglary

672
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,995
Shit! Did you
see the size of this house?

673
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,469
We could fit the whole building in here

674
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,437
There are a lot of doors, it's gonna
take us a whole day to open them

675
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,431
Let's split up, 2 here,
the rest in the other floors

676
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,829
We have to be out of here in 5 minutes

677
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,157
What? A burglary?
At my house? I'll be right over

678
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,671
I'm inspector Asmine,
I'm the one who called you

679
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,228
- Orsini, are they still here?
- Yes, sure

680
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,517
How many are they?
What race? African? North African?

681
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,830
Why? To make a burglary,
they have to be one of the 2?

682
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,036
Can you answer my question?

683
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,031
There are many... no particular sign

684
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,078
Very well inspector, I see you are very
observant, this will do us a lot of good

685
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,549
All right guys, take your positions,
Michel, Philipe, come with me

686
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,029
3 teams, one radio, there in the back

687
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,589
Watch out! Take cover!
Hide guys! Call for back up

688
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,118
Into the closet

689
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,751
Shit! There are cops everywhere, guys

690
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,070
- Damn it!
- We're not home yet

691
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,516
- And yet, they're everywhere
- I'd rather face the angry dogs

692
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,632
- I only hope we have a secondary plan
- For now, nothing changes, we keep looking

693
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,115
Wasn't "heavily armed"
a particular sign for you?

694
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,838
Yes, of course, but we don't
know if they are doing the shooting

695
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,993
Maybe it's the maid, thanks for
all you help, inspector, go back to Vitry

696
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,230
And let us do our work

697
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,439
What's going on here? What's it to you?

698
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,559
I'm doing my job, I called it in, maybe
you'd rather I keep my mouth shut again?

699
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,270
- Asmine, are you still here? Beat it
- Which way? You closed the whole city

700
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,113
I'm in charge of this operation, good day to
you, some burglars broke into your house

701
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,111
Inspector Asmine caught
them in the act and warned us

702
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,031
We were able to act
fast, and surround them

703
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,315
- They're still in my house then?
- Yes, sir

704
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,356
What are you waiting
for, to throw them out?

705
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,271
- That they finish looting my house?
- No, of course

706
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,954
But such an intervention
requires a minimum of preparation

707
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,669
Is there any of your staff
that might still be inside?

708
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,954
There's nobody home

709
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,953
But I do have valuable things in there and l
order you to attack before they wreck the place

710
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,600
I don't think such
an intervention is a delicate one

711
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:22,876
I give you 5 minutes to kick those bastards
out of my house or I call your superiors

712
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,349
As you wish, sir

713
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,474
Smoke bombs,
we can't see a thing anymore

714
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,471
Let's go up to the first floor

715
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,513
What are you waiting for? They're crazy!

716
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,158
Commander, charge!

717
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,032
Charge!

718
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,878
We have to find something
quick, cause I'm not feeling well

719
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,996
I think I've got the solution

720
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,950
- Hello?
- Michelin? We need you now

721
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,031
All right, I'm coming

722
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,471
Quick, quick

723
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,959
Yes, we have smashed the door,
we're facing a strong resistance, over

724
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:51,909
Secure the area, be calm, okay?

725
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,393
- What on earth are they doing in there?
- They're cleaning the house

726
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,313
- Go, go, let's split
- Come on, go

727
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,678
We're taking out 2 civilians,
we found on the scene, no wounded

728
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,988
Call the emergency medical service

729
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,753
Mr. adviser...
you said there's nobody home

730
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,512
Yes, there was no one

731
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,397
Besides the maid and...

732
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,358
Listen, I can't monitor
the movements of my employees

733
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,033
Be careful, there might be more civilians
inside, a possible hostage situation

734
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,998
You can put pressure on a lot of things, sir

735
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,631
But you'll find it hard stopping me from
mentioning your irresponsible attitude in my report

736
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,275
Asmine, come with me

737
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,950
Search all the rooms,
there must be a trap door leading to the roof

738
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,075
Nothing in the back, the road is clear

739
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:09,518
Hey guys, I have a problem here, or two

740
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,989
What are your names, kids?

741
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,479
- Carlos
- Jean Pierre

742
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,595
Is this your house?

743
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,433
Non, mom is cleaning
the house and I'm playing

744
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,636
And I'm Carlo's friend

745
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,312
Which floor is this?

746
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,312
Level 3

747
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,869
- We have a new obstacle
- Crack it open

748
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,997
We have 2 kids with us you buffoons

749
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,550
Get out of the house
and we'll give them back to you

750
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,350
The 2 kids on the 2nd floor,
are they members of your staff?

751
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,396
or you kids but you forgot to mention them?

752
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,835
2 kids? I don't
understand, I don't have kids...

753
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,595
Yes, I do have a 10 year old son but he's with
his mom, I truly don't understand any of this

754
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,636
- Does the cleaning lady live with you?
- No

755
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,676
She cleans the house every afternoon

756
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,318
She must have
brought her kids along

757
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,958
Check it out with her,
she's at the medical center

758
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,553
I'm gonna have to ask
you to leave the ground, sir

759
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,393
Given your bad information,
the area is getting more dangerous

760
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,391
I'm old enough to know what I must...

761
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:15,190
You will leave the perimeter
or I'll have you arrested, clear?

762
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,433
Come on kids, go through here
they'll take you home

763
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,279
Jean-Pierre, you need more exercising

764
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:37,239
My arm! My arm! Help me!

765
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:37,920
Let go of him

766
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,275
Let go of him

767
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,675
The roof, we have to get
to the roof, come on, let's go

768
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,351
Move! Quick!

769
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,158
What's all this?
I said let them get out before acting

770
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,356
That's exactly what we did

771
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,839
What's wrong with everybody?
Is there a full moon or what?

772
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,992
Shit!

773
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,875
- This way guys!
- Well done!

774
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,918
- Yes
- What are you doing? Where are you?

775
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,752
I'm here,
maybe about 1 00 meters from you

776
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,912
But there's a roadblock,
wait, I'll try to get through

777
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,837
Hello there, I'm sorry but I live nearby

778
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,115
I don't care, clear out of here and be quick

779
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,714
Don't use the phone in the car

780
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,711
- They're even worse than our cops
- Pull over somewhere and come on foot

781
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,836
You must absolutely get
to the north side of the building

782
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,558
Okay, I'll call you back

783
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,034
Let's put the money
and jewellery in one bag

784
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,632
Stand close to the wall sir, if you please

785
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,757
- What's going on?
- Hostage situation, you can't stay here

786
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,718
- I live here...
- Sorry, nobody gets through, it's dangerous

787
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,872
- Come back in an hour
- No way

788
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,155
if I don't take my medicine
in 15 minutes, I'll be dead

789
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,869
I don't mind dying at your feet
but I'm afraid it won't benefit your promotion

790
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,915
Captain, I saw some
shadows in the 2nd floor

791
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,314
Orsini to Swat 1, we've located them
south side, by the windows of the 2nd floor

792
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,799
Copy that!

793
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,037
I managed to get through,
I'll be there in 1 0 seconds

794
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,714
Very well, I see you,
on zero, you show the best home run ever

795
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,633
- Then, you know what to do?
- Yes, no problem

796
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,836
Baseball, it's your move

797
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,951
What are you doing,
sir? Stand by the wall

798
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,752
Yes!

799
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,637
They're on the roof

800
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,150
Yankee-o, visiting team-1

801
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:02,398
Now guys, here's a story
that you better not forget

802
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,591
Hands up

803
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,077
We have the situation
under control, no one was hurt

804
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,039
It was about time! that
was starting to bother me

805
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,237
Thanks Asmine, you'll come with us
to the precinct to help us with the report

806
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,357
We have to make a counter-weight
because the adviser's report will be dirty

807
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,796
Let's go, guys... Iet's go

808
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,515
- Are you coming?
- I have my car

809
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,999
Let's go

810
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,432
I have some good news

811
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,751
They called from Switzerland,
the donor died 1 0 minutes ago

812
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,752
We must hurry and reply within an hour

813
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,673
After which, the heart
won't be good for transplanting

814
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,837
Do you have the money?

815
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,311
It'll be here! At noon, as planned

816
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,351
See you later!

817
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,514
We're not out of the woods yet

818
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,354
Don't you have a plan to get us out of here?

819
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,589
I had to choose
between jail and the hospital

820
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,035
I think I would have chosen the hospital

821
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,475
They would have treated you,
and sent you back to jail

822
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,950
I just hope that what we did wasn't in
vain and that little Djamel will make it

823
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,758
- Dream on!
- Why do you say that?

824
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,115
Don't you see who we gave
the money to? To the goose

825
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,520
He's gonna lose the money
before getting to the hospital

826
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:42,554
He's gonna lose the money
before getting to the hospital

827
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,110
How much do you want for it?

828
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,111
227,500 Francs

829
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,953
- For the whole thing?
- Yes, and not a dime less

830
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,353
I know it's worth a lot more,
but it's for a good cause

831
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,871
Very well, if it's for
a good cause, it's a deal!

832
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,234
Deal!

833
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,519
Up you go, the captain wants to see you

834
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,637
- Go ahead, we're listening
- Wednesday is my day off

835
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,678
So I decided to go with the guys
to the capital to change scenery

836
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,672
Because the air is
not that pure in the suburbs

837
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,069
We were strolling down the rich district

838
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,879
- We like to go there
- It feels like a museum

839
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,555
- But it's free
- We walked by a very sumptuous palace

840
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,596
- A pad of hell
- Cinderella's tour

841
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,477
- Suddenly...
- We heard screaming

842
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,676
- Shouting
- As if Cinderella is being slayed

843
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,398
- Without thinking...
- We went in

844
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,994
- We could have called the cops
- If we thought about it

845
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,069
No offense, sir

846
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,516
Cops scare people in our
neighborhood, so we don't trust them

847
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,592
- So we jumped over the closed gate
- To save the old lady

848
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,148
- Luckily, there was an open window
- And 2 men...

849
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,196
- 3 scary guys
- They were 5 at least

850
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,952
Bald headed...
only were missing some accessories

851
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,553
Maybe they were 6

852
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,632
- They hit the poor lady
- They locked her in the closet

853
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,598
- So, we jumped on them
- We beat the pants off them

854
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,956
That's for sure, and I think
you would have done the same thing

855
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,429
- That's when we heard the sirens
- And the cops showed up

856
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,080
In the meantime,
the burglars hightailed it with the loot

857
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,991
We thought that nobody will believe us

858
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,913
- Then, your friends started shooting at us
- Before we knew it...

859
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,389
We panicked, that's only natural

860
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,434
- What do you take me for?
- It's the truth sir, I swear

861
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,794
- On my mother's life
- On my brother's

862
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,110
- On my life of my 2 brothers
- Of all the people I know

863
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,156
I can't swear on my father's life, he's dead

864
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,389
On the life of my family

865
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,313
It's the truth, I'm ready to spit
if you wouldn't get it wrong

866
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,470
Back to the cell

867
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,393
Have you ever seen
such a web of foolishness?

868
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,312
Everything in this report is true

869
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,756
I'm the main witness
and I vouch for them

870
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,190
At least, this will make
things easier, I hope he's insured

871
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,392
He better be

872
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,399
Hey you, the 7 dwarfs! Out you go

873
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:34,270
Come on, out you go, you're going home,
the inspector testified in your favor

874
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,952
Scram, before he changes his mind

875
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,839
Aila! Aila! I got it!

876
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,030
I got it

877
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,111
I got it

878
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,759
- Here you are! You can count it
- I believe you

879
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,920
400 thousand francs, in cash,
go ahead, call them, we shouldn't waste time

880
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,911
400 thousand francs, in cash,
go ahead, call them, we shouldn't waste time

881
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,992
Yes, sure, it's 12:10

882
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,356
So, we are 10 minutes late, sorry

883
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,238
Pick up the phone and call
your friends, go ahead, quick

884
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,959
They've got another offer for 500 thousand

885
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,357
I held them up until 12:05
then they didn't want anything to do with me

886
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,277
I am sorry

887
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,870
Are you sure?

888
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,669
Are you sure you tried everything?
Because we are losing our patience

889
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,030
Stay back! Go away!
Don't do anything stupid or I shoot

890
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,954
- Go away or I'll call the cops
- The cops are here

891
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,876
I'm gonna move closer
so you can read my badge

892
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:24,833
Is that good? Can you read it?
Do you see what's written here? Police

893
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,111
Put down your weapon

894
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:46,589
To aim a weapon at a civilian without this
badge is punishable by 12 months in prison

895
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,149
But we're gonna forget
the cops for a second

896
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,390
And speak, man to man

897
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,358
How much is your
life worth? 20 thousand?

898
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,918
Come on, to be generous, 100 thousand

899
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,558
Plus 400 thousand

900
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,110
That's 500 thousand,
that's the right amount

901
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:13,111
If Djamel doesn't get a new heart
in 2 hours I'll tear out yours, is that clear?

902
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,991
Zicmu, turn down the music,
we can't hear one another
