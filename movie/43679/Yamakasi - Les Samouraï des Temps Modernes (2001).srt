00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,475
Which face? East. The hardest.

00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,954

They're doing BIeuets. No!

Straight up. I saw them.

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,239
UnbeIievabIe!

17
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,870
I had a drink. Liar!

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,439
I'm not.

19
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,911
You saw that redhead!

20
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,036
What redhead?

21
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,997
I saw you. I foIIowed you.

22
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,469
Get off my case!

23
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,709
That's cIass!

24
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,116
TotaIIy awesome!

25
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,429
Once is enough.

26
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,949
Here comes the cavaIry.

27
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,198
Too Iate, as usuaI.

Let's go.

29
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,993
Okay, move it!

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,873
Move it, guys!

Get outta here.

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,115
If we're too big for you, caII for back-up.

37
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,833
Come again?

38
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,509
Let it go.

39
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,028
Every morning, the same thing.

40
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,394
Guys, over here! Come on!

41
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,108
Let's get going, guys!

42
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,476
Move it!

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,432
Come on, guys!

45
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,030
Morning, boss.

46
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,359
Enough is enough

47
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,671
I Iike a joke but not on me!

48
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,351
Everyone in here!

49
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,713
Let's recap.

50
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,675
YA-MA-KA-SI

51
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,797
7 kids making fooIs of us.
We'II teach them.

52
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,793
Let me introduce: Ousmane Dadjacan,

53
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,636
a.k.a. Zicmu,

54
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,910
Mister Music

55
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,037
What now?

56
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,113
What's wrong? Morning.

57
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,798
Music's too Ioud. Come in.

58
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,388
Sorry about this. Go ahead.

59
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,556
On 3, we're coming in!

60
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,558
1 ! 2! 3!

61
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,715
Don't do that, kid... we're sorry...

62
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,396
But the music's too Ioud.

63
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,349
No!

64
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,429
PoIice brutaIity!

65
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,839
Not poIice brutaIity, poIice stupidity.

66
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,430
Any more and I'II suspend you.

67
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,437
Next up.

68
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,078
Jean-MicheI Lucas, a.k.a. Tango.

69
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,151
You gotta see this. He's crazy

70
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,799
OK, what's going on?

71
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,632
Morning, Ms. Boutin!

72
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,115
What's with you? I swear, he...

73
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,870
OK, back to work and stop wasting my time.

74
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,752
I'II stop him dancing.

75
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,439
Fasten your beIts, this is Abdou N'Goto,

76
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,509
a.k.a. Rocket, as in speed not science.

77
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,511
Forget it.

78
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,439
We'II get him next time.

79
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,993
You onIy make it worse.

80
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,994
If ever I Iay my hands on him...

81
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,590
TaIking of which,

82
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,349
sIipping between our fingers is

83
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,597
Bruno Duris, a.k.a. Spider...

84
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,396
Stop it, you'II crease my dress.

85
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,756
Sorry...

86
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,193
Can I waIk you to work? Maybe.

87
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,035
Go on...

88
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,990
There's worse.

89
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,919
MaIik N'Diaye... WeaseI.

90
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,756
GirIs, watch this!

91
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,557
SaIto...

92
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,153
Check it out, girIs!

93
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,719
Guys, what are you doing?

94
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,114
Put that back.

95
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,958
Quit fooIing.

96
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,788
Pathetic.

97
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,514
Go ahead and Iaugh.

98
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,756
You won't find this one so funny.

99
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,790
BasebaII!

100
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,150
ReaI name: OIiver Chen.

101
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,075
Thief!

102
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,869
Stop him!

103
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,113
Wannabe heroes.

104
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,997
They're not crooks.

105
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,548
ScaIing buiIdings is iIIegaI.

106
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,398
It's not steaIing. It's kiIIing time.

107
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,717
By wasting ours?

108
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,116
Why can't they just pIay soccer

109
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,877
Iike everybody eIse? Sir...

110
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,560
Enough!

111
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,113
Our job is to keep the peace. You don't

112
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,959
cIimb buiIdings, wake peopIe at 6AM,

113
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,590
and make fooIs of the poIice. CIear?

114
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,354
Last but not Ieast

115
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,556
Ousmane Bana,

116
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,829
a.k.a. Sitting BuII.

117
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,635
C'mon, you're Iast again.

118
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,595
One day, I'II see him faII.

119
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,592
Japan had 7 Samurai
the U.S. had the Magnificent 7

120
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,994
We have 7 pains in the ass.

121
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,994
We're gonna show them
this city's not a zoo.

122
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,752
This week! Or eIse I caII in the big boys

123
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,879
and it'II be a safari.

124
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,275
So get going!

125
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,517
Cousin! You bring good news?

126
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,596
Good and bad. You got fired?

127
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,308
Not yet. So what's the good news?

128
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,908
That this isn't work.

129
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,633
I'm here as a friend. Sounds bad.

130
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,673
We had a meeting.
My boss has you guys in the cross hairs.

131
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,360
Is that a compIiment?

132
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,989
You'II have to stop puIIing your stunts.

133
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,033
Take a trip to the AIps.

134
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,351
You can do aII the cIimbing you want.

135
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,596
Why us? We don't cause any troubIe.

136
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,871
But you do! Think about the parents.

137
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,794
What parents? The kids idoIize you.

138
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,870
They wanna be anti-cop rebeIs Iike you,

139
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,832
but without training Iike you.

140
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,031
When one of them faIIs, how wiII it feeI?

141
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,879
I'm a smaII-time cop.

142
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,958
The power I have is tiny...infinitesimaI.

143
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,277
And being haIf-Arab, divide it by 2 again.

144
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,035
If you don't heIp me, I can't heIp you.

145
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,398
Come round tonight.

146
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,235
My Ma's frying chicken. Sounds good?

147
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,433
If your Mom's cooking...

148
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,359
DjameI, Iet's pretend we're Yamakasi!

149
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,957
CIimb up here!

150
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,479
I can't. My heart...

151
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,795
That's to get out of gym cIass.

152
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,114
Don't be a sissy.

153
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,633
I'm not aIIowed.

154
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,432
Do you ask permission to pee?

155
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,079
C'mon, show us you can do it.

156
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,909
Prove you're a yamakasi.

157
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,035
Everybody's watching.

158
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,437
You shouId be ashamed...Come on!

159
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,033
Come on, DjameI!

160
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,111
Prove you're a yamakasi.

161
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,114
You're aImost there.

162
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,079
AImost!

163
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,671
Come on, DjameI!

164
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,078
DjameI!

165
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,275
DjameI...no!

166
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,829
HeIIo?

167
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,475
DjameI?

168
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,268
AiIa!

169
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,669
It's DjameI...

170
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,992
HeIIo?

171
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,952
He's doing OK.

172
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,957
This time, it's serious.

173
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,399
We said: no games.

174
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,748
It was at schooI. We can't Iock him up.

175
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,393
Sure.

176
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,950
What happens now?

177
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,474
We have 24 hours to do the transpIant...

178
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,630
He's on the Iist, isn't he?

179
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,035
Sure, but it's not that simpIe.

180
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,078
He has top priority but we need a donor.

181
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,638
Right pIace, right time. It changes hourIy.

182
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,871
But what can we do? Nothing?

183
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,238
Come with me.

184
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,037
As I thought...Nothing in France.

185
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,069
So?

186
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,953
We have to wait.

187
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,914
Sometimes, an organ turns up Iast minute.

188
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,472
Don't Iose hope.

189
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,197
Outside France?

190
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,957
We use a go-between company.

191
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,671
Let's take a Iook.

192
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,158
There's one. Swiss, O negative

193
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,038
avaiIabIe in a few hours.

194
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,111
perfect and unoptioned.

195
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,997
Meaning?

196
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,078
It's not been reserved as yet.

197
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,110
It's free or wiII become so in a few hours.

198
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,354
How do we take out an option?

199
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,516
OfficiaIIy, we can't.

200
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,792
UnofficiaIIy,
as it's an emergency, I can try.

201
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,998
Go on, then, we're for it.

202
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,236
Any idea of the cost?

203
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,078
At Ieast 400,000 francs.

204
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,674
We ain't got money.

205
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,033
Ask your friends and famiIy.

206
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,276
If everyone chips in...

207
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,353
What about Medicare?

208
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,989
They'II pay for the transpIant here.

209
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,948
The rest is not strictIy IegaI.

210
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,559
If it heIps, I'II take the risk.

211
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,429
Just for you.

212
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,109
There, I've optioned it. It's reserved.

213
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,719
DjameI has a new heart waiting for him.

214
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,272
You have tiII noon tomorrow.

215
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,278
It's up to you now.

216
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,234
You'II kiII us aII. Music can't kiII.

217
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,710
Turn it down. I work a driII aII day.

218
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,916
Turn it down!

219
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,955
Take an aspirin. AII gone.

220
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,118
Aren't my paIs cooI? Sure.

221
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,631
CarefuI!

222
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,555
I'II get a sponge. Bring a mop, why not?

223
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,872
Are you on a diet?

224
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,034
They're for my asthma. 2 during meaIs.

225
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,513
You're stiII eating?

226
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,153
I bought 2 kgs of Iemon.

227
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,112
AII gone? Anyone seen...?

228
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,913
Hey, I'm practicing

229
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,429
Try bananas. Fridge's fuII of them.

230
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,750
Try thinking as fast as you run.

231
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,236
Aren't you coming in? Sure.

232
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,951
ProbIems?

233
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,152
A kid had a bad faII at schooI.

234
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,234
LittIe DjameI. You know him?

235
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,715
AiIa's brother. He's in intensive.

236
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,275
Chances are 1 000-1 . Know what happened?

237
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,237
He was cIimbing a tree at schooI.
Imitating the big boys.

238
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,550
Vincent! LoveIy to see you again.

239
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,037
Where's your uniform?

240
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,229
I work at a desk.

241
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,511
So? Can't you Iook smart at a desk?

242
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,911
For you boys, it's not short rations.

243
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,834
We're not short.

244
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,315
You did it, WeaseI? HonestIy?

245
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,352
East face in under 1 0 minutes.

246
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,754
As usuaI, I was the first one up.

247
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,593
Rasta Rocket! You sure are quick.

248
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,470
It's great but I'm fuII.

249
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,949
How are you going to catch the thieves

250
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,950
if you're not big enough to frighten them?

251
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,713
Fatima! Not that!

252
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,750
They're taking my son away...

253
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,349
Don't do it! Come inside!

254
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,839
It won't change anything.

255
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,479
Spread out beIow.

256
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,229
AiIa!

257
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,957
No!

258
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,994
Fatima!

259
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,709
Ma!

260
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,679
Fatima!

261
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,518
It's my son who needs heIp.

262
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,955
We'II sit down and find a soIution

263
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,992
we'II heIp your son. Look at me...

264
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,035
There must be a way.

265
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,998
Trust me.

266
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,872
Listen...

267
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,196
We'II find a way for DjameI.

268
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,080
You have my word.

269
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,435
No!

270
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,679
Proud of yourseIves?

271
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,758
What a bunch of idiots, huh?

272
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,949
We saved your mother.

273
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,319
What about my brother?

274
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,478
Who'II save him? You and your stunts?

275
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,759
DjameI wiII die.

276
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,079
And it's your fauIt!

277
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,917
CaIm down!

278
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,911
Let me go!

279
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,958
We never wanted this.

280
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,639
We never hurt anyone. Just the opposite.

281
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,273
Last week, we saved a granny.

282
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,439
And she didn't even say 'thank you'.

283
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,030
We can't take this, we're no criminaIs.

284
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,799
HoId on.

285
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,552
We're not irresponsibIe, you know.

286
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,232
We cIimb at dawn to avoid the kids.

287
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,639
Stop, you're not bIind.

288
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,995
Kids don't ask our permission

289
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,958
before copying us.

290
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,435
OK, so what's the soIution?

291
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,353
You stop. Stop what?

292
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,951
Your games.

293
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,111
And sniff gIue, burn cars instead?

294
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,471
Smart-mouth!

295
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,828
Smart-mouth?

296
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,429
Finished?

297
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,993
You'II regret not being in uniform.

298
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,719
And you'II regret saying that.

299
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,795
Shut up!

300
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,630
Isn't that enough?

301
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,075
Now, you want a fight, too?

302
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,159
So, what do we do?

303
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,875
The onIy thing we can.

304
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,915
Make good.

305
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,112
Who Iet you up here?

306
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,676
We came to see DjameI.

307
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,155
That's not possibIe. It's too Iate.

308
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,313
Tomorrow.

309
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,637
We must. ImpossibIe, I said.

310
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,397
If my boss catches you... go home now.

311
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,232
MicheIin!

312
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,479
5 minutes.

313
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,431
Can we come in?

314
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,950
Sure.

315
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,079
CooI!

316
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,993
You're here to see me. Wicked!

317
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,678
Is it true about the East face?

318
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,835
News traveIs fast.

319
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,390
The cops must be spitting bIood.

320
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,112
No kidding, they're frothing.

321
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,120
The cops are frothing. Awesome.

322
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,799
When I'm oIder,

323
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,036
can I be a Yamakasi?

324
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,590
It's a Iot of hard work.

325
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,110
When you get out, if you want,

326
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,118
we'II teach you.

327
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,358
You have our word.

328
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,438
What the...? I'II caII you back.

329
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,513
You have an appointment?

330
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,596
It's about IittIe DjameI.

331
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,234
I see.

332
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,274
I don't know what to say.

333
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,675
The truth. It's a good start.

334
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,917
You're Ietting him die.

335
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,036
I put myseIf at risk
by taking out an option.

336
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,078
There's no more I can do.

337
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,551
What's the money probIem?

338
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,915
The hospitaI cannot fund the transfer.

339
00:27:52,040 --> 00:28:00,630
Do you expect me to pay for it?

340
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,636
Who are these peopIe? MiddIemen.

341
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,993
H.T.C. Corp.

342
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,678
What if they Iend us the cash first?
We'II pay it back.

343
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,070
ImpossibIe. Even if I go for it,

344
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,437
the 7 board members stiII need to agree.

345
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,993
So, make 7 caIIs.

346
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,519
I can't do that. When there's a wiII...

347
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,954
Just try. It's easy.

348
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,315
I can't! Look at the time!

349
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,510
I can't caII just for...

350
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,993
Just for a dying kid?

351
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,389
I didn't say that.

352
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,715
Yours? Give me that!

353
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,035
Very heaIthy Iooking. Let go...

354
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,869
Enough!
I want you out of my office in 1 0 seconds

355
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,037
and outside in 1 minute.

356
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,275
The money wiII be here noon tomorrow.

357
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,510
They Iet a kid die and say it's our fauIt!

358
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,953
It's warped. They deserve cutting up.

359
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,149
Bad idea.

360
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,793
Got a better one, wise guy?

361
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,959
This is France. PeopIe aren't Ieft to die.

362
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,072
Oh, yeah?

363
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,158
ReaI Iife's different from Iaw books.

364
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,036
With no money, DjameI gets Ieft to die.

365
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,195
Shit, caIm down!

366
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,117
Let's think. How 'bout the banks?

367
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,038
What? Look at us!

368
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,430
We're not even weIcome in cIubs.

369
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,870
OnIy way we get in a bank is with guns.

370
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,396
You wanna Iend us yours.

371
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,037
Give me a few hours. I'II get the guys

372
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,834
and we'II do it IegaIIy, OK?

373
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,269
You do it by the book,
we'II do it with our hearts.

374
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,515
First to save DjameI wins. DeaI?

375
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,034
Just don't do anything stupid.

376
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,032
I'II do aII I can. I swear.

377
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,756
Where d'you get that? His office.

378
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,358
There's the 7 guys' addresses.

379
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,432
We'II kick their butts!

380
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,113
No vioIence.

381
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,232
Yeah, but Iet's give them heII!

382
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,311
Better than that. We'II teII them a story.

383
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,589
Take from the rich, give to the poor...

384
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,550
That cartoon... Robin Hood.

385
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,113
Rachid's kid sister has it on tape.

386
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,754
It's stiII steaIing, huh? Not reaIIy.

387
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,075
'Cuz it's to give back to them

388
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,399
Way to go!

389
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,999
I Iike that. I Iike it a Iot.

390
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,437
That's some idea. Awesome, man!

391
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,030
And we wind up in jaiI or hospitaI.

392
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,759
Don't be such a pessimist. AII in?

393
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,149
And me?

394
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,709
I wanna heIp DjameI, too.

395
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,792
You, stand by.

396
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,189
If things go wrong, we caII you.

397
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,033
OK? Great.

398
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,073
We meet up at 5.

399
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,355
Hey, Inspector, can't sIeep?

400
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,114
You seen the time?

401
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,475
EarIy, I know.

402
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,589
My Dad'II kiII you!

403
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,034
I have to go. It's important.

404
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,758
If I don't ever see you again...

405
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,835
I know I wiII but...

406
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,190
I'm no good at this Iove stuff.

407
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,836
You'II be proud of me.

408
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,158
We have to heIp DjameI

409
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,194
but it'II take time.

410
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,236
I won't be in today, so I can't cIock in.

411
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,959
Leave it to me.

412
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,076
3 groups, 2 jobs each, 60G per job.

413
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,314
OnIy cash?

414
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,038
JeweIry, credit cards...

415
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,952
Nothing big, nothing heavy.

416
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,516
Meet up at 1 0 at the Iast address.

417
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,638
2 hours per job is pIenty. Don't rush it.

418
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,073
Watch, act, disappear.

419
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,110
Keep your phone handy.

420
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,037
No probIem! I've got back-up.

421
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,473
5:30!

422
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,679
5th fIoor.

423
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,155
Forget it... Kitchen.

424
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,875
This is no time for breakfast. Let's go.

425
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,068
Come on. No way.

426
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,753
4 hours to save DjameI!

427
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,110
You go Ieft, I go right.

428
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,676
CaII the poIice!

429
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,910
Thank you.

430
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,478
Is the minister in? It's important.

431
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,994
He's away today.

432
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,031
His SpeciaI Advisor?

433
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,511
I spoke to someone
who said he got in earIy.

434
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,631
UsuaIIy. Are you expected?

435
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,320
It's about a IittIe boy...

436
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,755
Are you expected?

437
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,039
It's urgent. We have untiI noon...

438
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,230
You must have an appointment.

439
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,429
Write him, I'II see he gets it.

440
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,151
This reaIIy is urgent...

441
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,072
I can't heIp you. I'm sorry.

442
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,720
He's strict on protocoI.

443
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,909
A boy is dying

444
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,356
and you're quoting protocoI?

445
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,314
Take it easy!

446
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,028
CaII your boss. Got it now?

447
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,629
What's going on? Sir...

448
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,075
Inspector Asmine, sir.

449
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,039
Sorry to barge in.

450
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,958
A chiId is dying. OnIy you can heIp.

451
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,949
I didn't reaIize I was so powerfuI.

452
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,158
Come in my office.

453
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,352
Take a seat.

454
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,316
He sure can paint.

455
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,953
Look at the size of it.

456
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,589
Nothing big. Find something eIse.

457
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,719
Enough to put you off music for Iife.

458
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,752
5 minutes and out.

459
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,508
How d'you know? Mission ImpossibIe

460
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,198
There must be a key...

461
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,029
I know.

462
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,995
HoId on, the man needs some cuIture.

463
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,114
Check it out, punk!

464
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,434
A most unusuaI situation.

465
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,992
I apoIogize for my unorthodox approach.

466
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,997
No, you were quite right.

467
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,229
It's a reminder that we serve the peopIe.

468
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,511
It does you credit.

469
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,359
Thank you. Can you heIp?

470
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,268
I'II see what the medicaI corps can do.

471
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,913
The airforce can spare a pIane for this.

472
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,838
Thanks. Thanks for DjameI.

473
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,075
My pIeasure.

474
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,955
Ain't Iife sweet?

475
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,952
A mansion of our own.

476
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,955
Hey, take it easy.

477
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,309
You're crazy.

478
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,233
There are aIarms everywhere.

479
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,438
No worries, watch this.

480
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,309
Easy. Too easy to be true.

481
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,029
Too heavy.

482
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,152
Too fragiIe. Too cooI!

483
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,557
Oh no!

484
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,518
We're screwed!

485
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,596
They're spIitting up.

486
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,355
What do we do?

487
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,678
We wait. Spread out.

488
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,429
A bit more.

489
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,276
Now!

490
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,074
No more dogs for me.

491
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,919
I warned you.

492
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,795
Man's best friend...yeah, right.

493
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,517
Hope the others are doing better.

494
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,468
We'II make up for it.

495
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,837
I ain't going back there.

496
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,035
AiIa? It's Vincent.

497
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,998
I've got good news.

498
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,953
I saw the Minister's top man.

499
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,636
He wants to heIp us...

500
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,996
DjameI, I mean.

501
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,756
He's doing aII he can

502
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,473
and he'II caII me. Great, huh?

503
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,432
What's he suggesting exactIy?

504
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,516
Commandeering a miIitary aircraft...

505
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,798
AiIa?

506
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,909
HoId on.

507
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,918
They'II do aII that for DjameI?

508
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,110
Sure, he promised me.

509
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,438
Do you doubt me?

510
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,717
Not you, aII the rest of it.

511
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,951
Be strong. DjameI wiII be saved.

512
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,956
We're getting there, trust me.

513
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,913
What's going on? Gotta go.

514
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,600
You're a cop, not a sociaI worker!

515
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,392
Your job is to protect, not hassIe peopIe.

516
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,153
But... No buts!

517
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,989
The Minister's Advisor caIIed me.

518
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,029
Why did you insuIt him in his office?

519
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,434
I didn't! He says so.

520
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,790
You beat up his guy, barged in the door,

521
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,037
and toId him some sob story.

522
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,038
That's not true!

523
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,038
Who cares if it's true or not?

524
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,874
The probIem is deaIing with aII this crap.

525
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,030
HonestIy, I don't get it.

526
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,713
Stop being so naive, it's boring.

527
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,068
A boy couId die...

528
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,269
We're cops, OK? Not God or charity.

529
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,238
Our job is to obey orders.

530
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,118
A dying kid is not our probIem.

531
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,117
Obey! Get that into your head.

532
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,556
We don't think, we keep order.

533
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,789
Do your job and the fIock's OK.

534
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,434
It's not compIicated.

535
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:39,951
Here, make yourseIf usefuI.

536
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,550
What are you doing?

537
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,356
Don't worry, it's routine.

538
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,358
He can't stay where he was.

539
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,796
Why not? We need the space.

540
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,638
He's OK here. In the haIIway?

541
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,916
For now. We'II keep an eye on him.

542
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,795
He's not dead yet, you know!

543
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,277
The morgue's downstairs.
Here, we treat peopIe.

544
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,198
There's 5 of us for the whoIe fIoor.

545
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,396
And 2 serious cases have just arrived.

546
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,192
My brother's not serious?

547
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,954
For the moment, we can't heIp him.

548
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,156
The others have priority.

549
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,918
But his turn wiII come.

550
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,234
The best thing you can do

551
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,309
is to caIm down and stay with him.

552
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,673
Easy, boys, easy.

553
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,711
PoIice. Come in.

554
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,079
The burgIary?

555
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,950
Didn't take much. My dogs chased them off.

556
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,992
They got in by neutraIizing the door aIarm.

557
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,434
then into the Iiving room.

558
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,709
Why they?

559
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,154
That!

560
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,949
8 cameras. I got them from every angIe.

561
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,590
Look.

562
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,919
You're weII-equipped.

563
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,196
After 5 burgIaries, I'd had enough.

564
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,034
What do you do? I'm a surgeon.

565
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,118
I'm never home.

566
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,548
Very agiIe.

567
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,033
ReaI spring Iambs. A circus act?

568
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,352
D'you mind?

569
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,879
Check if there's been simiIar jobs today.

570
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,829
Coffee? Thanks.

571
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,076
Yeah, me too.

572
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,915
May I? The waII socket there.

573
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,750
Look! A rash of acrobatic burgIaries.

574
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,274
4 this morning. And counting.

575
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,071
See what Iinks the victims.

576
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,749
Sports cIub, car or something...

577
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,758
Easy. They're aII doctors.

578
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,957
I knew it.

579
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,714
Any progress?

580
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,475
Some.

581
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,199
You know Henry Piracy? He's a coIIeague.

582
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,119
Mr. Gautier? Mr. Bernier?

583
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,993
FeIIow board members.

584
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,277
7 in aII. Directors of the same company.

585
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,870
The 7 th advises the Minister.

586
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,995
A printer? 3.

587
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,680
Warn the others to expect visitors.

588
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,910
I'II handIe the Advisor.

589
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,115
Goodbye.

590
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,993
The Ministry guy's not our jurisdiction.

591
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,758
I can handIe it.

592
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,954
You sure? After this morning...

593
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,798
Don't think, just obey orders.

594
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,836
So, obey!

595
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,792
Who is it? PoIice!

596
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,039
Sorry to disturb you.

597
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,633
A gang of burgIars has you on their Iist.

598
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,398
That's awfuI! Don't panic.

599
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,990
You're safe now. Can we Iook around?

600
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,272
Of course, come in.

601
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,030
Very nice. It's a KIimt.

602
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,076
We need to search.
Do you mind? Go right ahead.

603
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,034
Nothing there.

604
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,959
You think they're here?

605
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,435
You can never be too sure.

606
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,515
The way we work is simpIe.

607
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,429
Leave no stone unturned.

608
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,993
ApparentIy, no one's here.

609
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,559
ApparentIy, it's aII OK.

610
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,429
I said... ApparentIy.

611
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,113
They're sIippery feIIows.

612
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,115
And they work fast, in and out.

613
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,516
Are they dangerous? You never know...

614
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,313
WeII? Find anything?

615
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,036
You can sIeep soundIy tonight.

616
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,118
What if they come anyway?

617
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,115
Don't worry, we're everywhere.

618
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,359
A mouse couIdn't get through.

619
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,794
Thank you, I feeI much safer.

620
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,480
We're just doing our duty, Ma'am.

621
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,076
1 0 more minutes, I'd have here howIing.

622
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,274
Jesus, my KIimt! They stoIe my KIimt!

623
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,556
What KIimt? I don't get it.

624
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,796
Behind you, you idiots!

625
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,310
See anything?

626
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,714
Nothing.

627
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,675
They were here!

628
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,398
My KIimt! CaIm down!

629
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,989
What the...?

630
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,669
They're on the roof. CaII for back-up.

631
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,912
Let's move it!

632
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,075
You, over there, move it!

633
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,468
Oh crap!

634
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,194
We're in deep.

635
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,035
Cut it out!

636
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,396
There!

637
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,079
Stop!

638
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,836
There they are! This way!

639
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,949
Stubborn, these guys.

640
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,350
There they are!

641
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,952
Freeze! PoIice!

642
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,831
Don't move. Nice and easy.

643
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,792
Come this way.

644
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,069
Over here!

645
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,590
Easy does it. Come on.

646
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,475
Guess we don't have a pIan C?

647
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,797
Hands on heads!

648
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,509
Gave us the runaround, didn't you?

649
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,868
Hands on head

650
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,154
Sure we do.

651
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,388
Come here!

652
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,959
No funny stuff!

653
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,597
Don't be stupid!

654
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,031
Don't be...

655
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,315
Crazy...!

656
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,835
No way.

657
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,479
What's aII the...?

658
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,275
Ludo?

659
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,235
I know...

660
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,397
After homework, I'II tidy the room.

661
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,431
We take the stairs? Sure, take the stairs.

662
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,993
Crazy...

663
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:27,632
Thanks for coming.

664
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,189
They're here. Near. I saw them.

665
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,440
Who, DjameI? Who's here?

666
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,230
The spirits...watching over me.

667
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,951
No injuries? Not yet. Touch wood.

668
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,109
Getting anywhere?

669
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,036
SIowIy.

670
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,637
Get busy, then, instead of hassIing us.

671
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,352
Haven't you done enough?

672
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,194
What have you done? Seen the Minister?

673
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,911
And? He's on the case.

674
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,035
Let's go.

675
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,639
I can't Iet you do this.

676
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,034
I'm a cop, remember.

677
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,590
Change jobs. No can do.

678
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,273
I fight for what I beIieve in.

679
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,999
And we're fighting to save DjameI, see?

680
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,675
Let us by, we're Iate.

681
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,199
This is suicidaI.

682
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,999
The cops'II come and bIow you away.

683
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,351
He reaIIy thinks he's Dirty Harry!

684
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,754
Shut it, Rocket!

685
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,108
Have some respect!

686
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,998
You guys don't get it, huh?

687
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,957
There's friendship, and the Iaw.

688
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,753
If I betray my beIiefs, I'm nothing.

689
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,672
It's aII we have. Without it,

690
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,600
we've no seIf-respect, see?

691
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,998
We don't see why a kid's Iife

692
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,116
depends on rich doctors.

693
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,195
That's our beIief. We'II see it through.

694
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,988
Or we'd aIways regret it.

695
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,873
There must be another soIution. Forget it.

696
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,558
There's no time.

697
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,672
Next time we see AiIa and Fatima,

698
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,997
what wouId we do? Hide our eyes?

699
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,680
Coming!

700
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,716
Who are you? Robbers!

701
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,072
Check this pIace out!

702
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,152
My buiIding'd fit in here.

703
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,790
We'II be here aII day.

704
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,114
OK, spIit up. A fIoor each.

705
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,071
5 minutes, and we're gone.

706
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,078
A burgIary? I'II be right there.

707
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,433
I made the caII.

708
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,990
They stiII inside? Most IikeIy.

709
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,118
How many? What type? BIack?

710
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,593
Arab?

711
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,278
Those the onIy types?

712
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,877
Answer the questions.
SeveraI. No one type.

713
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,118
Very observant of you. Great heIp.

714
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,954
Come on, guys, Iet's go.

715
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,229
3 teams. Constant contact.

716
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,070
Watch out!

717
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,473
Take cover!

718
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,232
In the cIoset.

719
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,876
Cops aII over!

720
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,910
The war's not over.

721
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,075
They're everywhere. I preferred the dogs.

722
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,918
Do we have a pIan B?

723
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,111
Not yet. Keep going.

724
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,030
They're armed to the teeth.

725
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,032
You sure it was them?

726
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,470
Who then, the maid? Now go home.

727
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,636
and Iet us do our job.

728
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,315
What are you doing here?

729
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,629
My job. I raised the aIarm.

730
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,479
Is that OK with you?

731
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,870
I asked you to Ieave.

732
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,758
RoadbIock turned me back.

733
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,436
Orsini. Officer in charge here.

734
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,716
Asmine saw them entering your house,

735
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,150
caIIed us and here we are.

736
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,435
They're stiII inside?

737
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,392
Yes.

738
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,948
What are you waiting for?

739
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,718
For them to wreck my house?

740
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,759
We have to pIan our operation.

741
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,959
Is anybody eIse inside?

742
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,514
Nobody! I have vaIuabIe objects.

743
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,074
Get in there before they're ruined.

744
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,191
That may make a mess, too.

745
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,594
You have 5 minutes to kick them out

746
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,870
or I caII your superiors.

747
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,792
As you wish, sir.

748
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,389
Smoke bombs! Can't see a thing.

749
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,879
Upstairs!

750
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,315
WeII, Captain?

751
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,835
They're obviousIy Iunatics. Attack.

752
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,908
Charge!

753
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,919
This is bad. Think of something!

754
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,439
I've got it.

755
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,070
We need you. Now.

756
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:11,991
On my way.

757
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,039
Move it!

758
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,392
Door open.

759
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,670
Encountering resistance, over.

760
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,230
Proceed fIoor by fIoor.

761
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,715
CaIm and methodicaI, OK?

762
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,070
What are they doing? CIeaning up.

763
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,792
Come on, Iet's go.

764
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,634
2 civiIians coming out.

765
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,473
Not wounded. AmbuIance?

766
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,030
You said no one was inside?

767
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,679
There wasn't. Except the maid...

768
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,078
I don't know when she's in!

769
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,670
Extreme caution.
I don't want a hostage situation.

770
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,550
PuII aII the strings you want.

771
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,832
Your irresponsibiIity
wiII be noted in my report.

772
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,918
Come with me.

773
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,155
There must be a hatch to the roof.

774
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,513
Coast cIear.

775
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,879
We got a probIem.

776
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,799
2, in fact.

777
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,115
Who are you?

778
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,559
CarIos. Jean-Pierre.

779
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,391
You Iive here?

780
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,274
My Mom's the maid. I come and pIay.

781
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,192
We're buddies.

782
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,795
What LeveI?

783
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,988
LeveI 3.

784
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,990
Another barricade. Cut through.

785
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,550
We have 2 kids here.

786
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,278
CIear out and we'II hand them over.

787
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,638
The 2 kids...are they staff,
Yours or another omission?

788
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,916
2 kids? I don't have any kids.

789
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,190
I mean, my son's away with my wife.

790
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,912
I've no idea...

791
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,916
Is the maid Iive-in?

792
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,429
No, she onIy does afternoons.

793
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,674
They must be hers. Ask her.

794
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,992
Leave the sector.

795
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,509
It's getting dangerous here.

796
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,955
I'm big enough to know what...

797
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,235
Leave or you wiII be arrested!

798
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,554
Is that cIear?

799
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,349
Through there, kids. Go home.

800
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,035
Less games and more sports, OK?

801
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,436
They've got my arm!

802
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,909
HeIp me!

803
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,634
Let him go!

804
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,958
We have to get on the roof, guys.

805
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,359
QuickIy...

806
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,197
I toId you to Iet them out before going in.

807
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,113
That's what we did.

808
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,439
What's wrong with everyone?
Is it a fuII moon?

809
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,948
Darn it!

810
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,911
Up here. Good work.

811
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,677
Where the heII are you? 1 00 yards away.

812
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,640
There's a roadbIock. I'II give it a try.

813
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,110
Hi, officer, I Iive over there.

814
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,116
I just wanna go home. No way. Turn Ieft.

815
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,068
And hang up!

816
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,232
Worse than our cops.

817
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,999
Park it up and waIk.

818
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,674
Get around northside. OK, I'II caII you.

819
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,200
Put aII the Ioot in one bag.

820
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,758
Near the waII, pIease.

821
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,514
What's going on? You can't stay here.

822
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,676
I Iive just there. Sorry, too dangerous.

823
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,030
Come back Iater. It can't wait.

824
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,277
I need my piIIs or I die.

825
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,834
It's a fine pIace to die

826
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,036
but I'd ruin your career.

827
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,233
I saw movement up there. 3rd fIoor.

828
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,075
South side. 3rd fIoor.

829
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,037
Got it.

830
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,873
I'm through. Gimme 1 0 secs.

831
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,596
I see you. Get running.

832
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,035
You know what you gotta do?

833
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,030
No probIem.

834
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,035
BasebaII, it's aII yours!

835
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,395
Against the waII!

836
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,235
On the roof.

837
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,310
Yankees 0, Visitors 1 .

838
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,875
I'm gonna teII a story; so Iisten up.

839
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,351
Hands up!

840
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,993
AII under controI!

841
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,156
And about time, too.

842
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,077
Thanks. HeIp me with my report.

843
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,597
I'II need support against the Advisor.

844
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,835
C'mon, move it out!

845
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,631
Coming? I have my car.

846
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,635
Go!

847
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:44,950
I have good news.

848
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,989
The donor died 1 0 minutes ago.

849
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,195
They need an answer within the hour

850
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,670
so the organ can be transpIanted.

851
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,240
How's it going...The money?

852
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,550
It's coming.
It'II be here at noon as agreed.

853
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,515
We'II see.

854
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,031
What now?

855
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,752
You aIways have a pIan? What do we do?

856
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,993
It was jaiI or hospitaI.

857
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,838
I choose hospitaI.

858
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,669
They'd onIy patch you up for jaiI...

859
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,716
I hope it's worth it and DjameI recovers.

860
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,114
Dream on.

861
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,992
What? Who did we give the cash to?

862
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,557
That doofus is gonna get skinned.

863
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,395
How much?

864
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,998
227,500 francs?

865
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,430
For the Iot? Not a penny Iess.

866
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,951
It's a Iot but it's for a good cause.

867
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,230
In that case, you got a deaI.

868
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,155
DeaI!

869
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,474
On your feet. Boss wants to see you.

870
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,073
OK, son, I'm Iistening.

871
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,876
Wednesday's my day off. So I go to Paris...

872
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,350
Change of air. Seemed a good idea...

873
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,799
We cruised by the posh neighborhoods...

874
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,909
Like a museum...

875
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,075
And free...

876
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,668
And we're checking out this mansion...

877
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,756
Huge pad...CindereIIa's paIace...

878
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,598
SuddenIy...Shouts...

879
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,996
Screams...CindereIIa's...

880
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,072
What do we do? We go in...

881
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,031
CaII the cops? Not our styIe.

882
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,590
Sorry

883
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,989
Where we come from, can't trust no cops.

884
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,680
We jump over the gate...
Save the damseI in distress...

885
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,792
The window was open...And 2 scumbags...

886
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,036
ActuaIIy, 3 punks...No, at Ieast 5...

887
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,833
Skinheads and swastikas...6 of them...

888
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,393
Beating the Iady...

889
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,233
Throwing her in the cIoset...
We jumped 'em...

890
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,632
WhaIed 'em...Worked 'em over...

891
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,069
You'd have done the same.

892
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,392
Then, sirens...Cops aII over...

893
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,955
MeanwhiIe, the 2 IowIifes beat it...

894
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,878
Looks bad for us...

895
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,479
Cops shoot first...Ask questions Iater...

896
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,033
We panic... NaturaI...

897
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,594
BuIIshit... Honest truth, Captain

898
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,119
On my mother's Iife...

899
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,276
And my brothers', and my friends...

900
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,112
And my dad's, except he's dead aIready...

901
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,634
My whoIe famiIy...

902
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,239
I'd spit but you'd object.

903
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,635
Lock 'em up!

904
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,030
Have you ever read such crap?

905
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,790
Everything written here is true.

906
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,511
I'II testify to that.

907
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,273
That simpIifies everything.

908
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,072
I hope you're covered.

909
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,993
Better be.

910
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,795
Hey, the 7 Dwarves, Iet's go!

911
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,959
Let's go, I said. You're free.

912
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,995
The Inspector backs up your story.

913
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,555
Move it before he reconsiders.

914
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,359
I've got the money!

915
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,952
Count it! I beIieve you...

916
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,675
400,000 francs in cash by noon.

917
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,994
CaII them. There's no time to waste.

918
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,794
Of course... but it's 1 2:1 0.

919
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,232
So we're 1 0 minutes Iate. Sorry.

920
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,836
Now, caII your friends.

921
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,269
Hurry. Someone bid 500,000.

922
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,749
I tried to hoId them, but in the end...

923
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,834
I'm terribIy sorry.

924
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,599
Are you sure you tried?

925
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,037
Because you're trying our patience.

926
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,228
Back off! Don't try anything.

927
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,073
Get out, or I caII the cops.

928
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,550
We're aIready here.

929
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,678
I'II move sIowIy toward you.

930
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,120
CIose enough? Can you read it?

931
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,318
It says PoIice.

932
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:23,988
Put down your gun.

933
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,993
Pointing a gun at a civiIian
can get you 1 2 months.

934
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,435
Let's forget that for now.

935
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,152
We'II taIk man to man.

936
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,436
How much is your Iife worth? 20,000?

937
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,155
Let's be generous. 1 00,000 francs?

938
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,833
PIus 400,000 equaIs 500,000.

939
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,755
ExactIy what we need.

940
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,390
In 2 hours, DjameI has a new heart

941
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,912
Or I mangIe yours. Got it?

942
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,594
Turn it down, wiII you?

943
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,671
I am proud of you.
Sure but watch my jacket.

944
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,718
Mr. Hotshot!

945
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,558
Good news. You got fired?

946
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:06,995
Even better, I resigned.

947
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,912
Guys, the tape's for DjameI.

948
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,910
If you have a message...

949
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,274
Can you see us?

950
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,356
Hope you're feeIing OK.

951
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,035
Get weII soon.

952
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,393
And be ready for training.

953
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,958
YAMAKASI!

954
