1
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:29,521
For heaven's sake, Wendy,
look for an airport!

2
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,490
- Will you look for the airport?
- Oh, don't make such a fuss.

3
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:34,192
Just put it down on a mountain.

4
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,294
What do you mean,
just put it down?

5
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:38,329
I'm lucky I can keep it up.
I told you, I never flew before.

6
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:41,700
Don't shout at me.
I'm a first-class passenger.

7
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,536
You're a first-class lunatic!

8
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:46,839
It's all over, Wendy. Our relationship
has a quarter of a tank to go.

9
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,710
Yes, but you do love me,
don't you, Harold?

10
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,379
I know this is an awkward time
to bring it up,

11
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,147
but I must know for our future.

12
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:59,719
- Ohh! Aah!
- Harold, darling, do answer me.

13
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,892
Oh! Oh!

14
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,055
You can stop pretending to be
asleep, Sidney. It's over.

15
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:37,692
I was listening
to Beethoven's ninth.

16
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,929
Somewhere on this plane,
there's a wonderful orchestra.

17
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:43,197
The cameraman must do
luggage commercials.

18
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:45,399
All you could see
were the bags under my eyes.

19
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:48,503
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in five minutes, miss Barrie.

20
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,839
I suppose we must.

21
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,642
You were terrific!
I loved it!

22
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:55,010
Oh, thank you.
That's sweet.

23
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,879
What?

24
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,850
Oh. I hope
you win the Oscar!

25
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:04,720
It's bizarre.

26
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,756
Eight years with
the national theatre,

27
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:09,926
two Pinter plays, nine
Shakespeare, three Shaw,

28
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:13,296
and I finally get nominated
for a nauseating little comedy.

29
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:15,799
That's why
they call it Hollywood.

30
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,270
Oh!

31
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:24,875
Gorgeous color.
The smog.

32
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,843
I wonder if
they sell it in bottles.

33
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:29,946
It would make a wonderful present
for the folks back home.

34
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:32,784
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Barrie.

35
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:35,319
- The "no smoking" sign's on.
- Oh, sorry.

36
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,655
I thought it was meant
for the people down there.

37
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,764
Oh, Christ.
The royal treatment.

38
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:49,400
And if I lose, we go home
in a station wagon.

39
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,236
I can get used to this life
very easily, darling.

40
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,439
Promise me you'll
get nominated every year.

41
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,375
We have a magnificent suite
back at the hotel for you.

42
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:58,543
How nice.

43
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:00,445
I'll call you in half an hour.

44
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,249
Fine. Thank you.

45
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:26,405
Well, that's just fine. Unless
you're making a pot of tea,

46
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:27,807
I think we're in big trouble.

47
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,177
I didn't build the car.
I just drove it.

48
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:35,114
Did you look at the Gauge
like I told you to?

49
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,384
I looked at the Gauge
more than I looked at the road.

50
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,486
I ran off the road.
I did not run off the Gauge.

51
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,588
But if you looked at the Gauge,
it wouldn't have overheated.

52
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,825
You mean lookin' at the Gauge real
good stops it from overheatin'?

53
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,727
No, but you've got to speak up.

54
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:49,463
You've got to say, "hey, the
Gauge says we're overheating."

55
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:51,999
This is not the kind of news
that you keep to yourself.

56
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,201
You know, I hate rent-a-cars.
Why don't we just leave it here?

57
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:57,204
It's cooling off, see? I told you. All
we needed to do was give it a chance.

58
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:00,375
All right, close the hood.
Let's go. I'll drive.

59
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,510
Oh, no! Oh, god.

60
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,312
Say he didn't slam the hood.

61
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:06,848
What's the matter
with the doors?

62
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:09,851
Didn't the man say
not to slam the hood down?

63
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,553
Didn't the man say
the doors sometimes lock

64
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:14,956
when you slam the hood down?

65
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,158
Did the man say
I would burn my hand?

66
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,559
It's locked, all right.
Who's got the keys?

67
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,529
The car's got the keys!

68
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,264
Why didn't you take the keys?

69
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:24,400
I only went
from my seat to the hood.

70
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,635
I thought it would be safe. You
on his side. Stand over there.

71
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:28,504
What fool closed the windows?

72
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,506
That fool closed the windows.

73
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:31,808
Even with my eyes on the Gauge,

74
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:33,409
I saw that fool close
the windows.

75
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,913
The air-conditioning
doesn't work with open windows.

76
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,681
Well, now the car doesn't work
with closed windows,

77
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,017
does it, fool?

78
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:44,888
Smile, everybody!
We're in Los Angeles!

79
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,859
I'm not paying for this window.

80
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,193
Bettina, you're keeping
the books.

81
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,262
Put the window in his column.

82
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,897
We're drivin', ain't we?

83
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,166
We're not bein' towed, are we?

84
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,969
Deduct the cost of being towed
from my column.

85
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:01,738
Oh, when are you two gonna stop
bickering and start vacationing?

86
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,909
It's been like this
ever since we left Chicago.

87
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,411
I have to go to the bathroom.
Can we pull off

88
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,813
and find a gas station?

89
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,681
- Ok, honey.
- "Ok, honey"?

90
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,550
What do you mean, "ok, honey"?

91
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,153
This is no time for "ok,
honey." We're on a freeway.

92
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:18,689
When your wife wanted tacos,
I heard enough "ok, honeys."

93
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,592
Now, how am I
on that side, honey?

94
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,261
You're fine. Hurry up.

95
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,363
He's not fine
if he has to hurry up!

96
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,900
Watch what you're doing.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,168
Now! Now! Go now!

98
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:31,003
Hold it!

99
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:39,979
Whiplash!

100
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,415
Now we all got whiplash,
ok, honey?

101
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:57,964
Good luck tonight, miss Barrie.

102
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:00,300
- Uh, would you?
- Oh.

103
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,802
Everyone says
you're going to win.

104
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:04,670
Listen, I'm pleased
just to be nominated.

105
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,273
Can I have your picture?

106
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:10,377
Oh, just by yourself.

107
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:21,188
Herb, how are you?
Charlie, what do you say?

108
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,357
Billy boy. How's
the new script coming?

109
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:25,592
I found all the words
in the dictionary.

110
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,261
I just have to put 'em together.

111
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:29,363
I mean, we'll never
be able to afford this.

112
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:32,034
I mean, the prices
out here are ridiculous!

113
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:36,905
- Yeah, sure.
- Mrs. Hannah Warren, please.

114
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,307
- I asked them.
- Bill Warren.

115
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,854
Yes?

116
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:55,258
Where are you?

117
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:58,661
306.
Why don't you come up?

118
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:10,373
- Come in.
- One double scotch, one tea with lemon.

119
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:12,675
- Six dollars and ninety-five cents.
- Yes, ma'am.

120
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:15,079
Would it be possible to just
rent a couple of drinks?

121
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,248
Ma'am?

122
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:21,485
Uh, would you put that
on the coffee table, please?

123
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:28,125
Hello?
Oh, yes, put him on.

124
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:31,328
Bob? Oh, thank god,
a civilized voice.

125
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:33,497
How are you?

126
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:36,266
No, awful. I can't wait
to get out of here.

127
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:39,104
It's like paradise
with a lobotomy.

128
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,639
How's Washington?

129
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:45,676
Rain. Oh, god.
How wonderful.

130
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:50,515
No, no, nothing's settled yet.
He's on his way up.

131
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:55,186
Bob, I don't want to call in a
lawyer until I see how it goes.

132
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:58,156
When have you known me
to be intimidated?

133
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,760
That doesn't count.

134
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,697
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I remember it in detail.

135
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:12,271
Bob, can you save
the erotic conversation

136
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:16,375
until it can do
us both some good?

137
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:20,380
Yes. Yes, I will. I'll call
you as soon as he leaves.

138
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,816
I do too. Bye.

139
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,619
Looks like another
beautiful day, huh?

140
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,456
For a change.

141
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,699
Hello, Hannah.

142
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,937
You were supposed to knock.

143
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:46,174
I was going to keep you
waiting in the hall.

144
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:48,242
You screwed up my big moment.

145
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:50,444
You still have trouble
saying a simple "hello."

146
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:52,246
Oh, I am sorry.

147
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,816
You always did get a thrill out
of the little things in life.

148
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:56,950
Hello, bill.

149
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:59,720
Hello, Hannah.

150
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:02,490
How are you?

151
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,160
At this moment,
I'm completely nonplussed.

152
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,895
What the hell have
you done to yourself?

153
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,863
You've turned
into a young boy again.

154
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,200
- It's good to see you.
- I mean it.

155
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,636
You look like the sweetest,
young, 14-year-old boy.

156
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,671
You're not spending
your summers at camp, are you?

157
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:19,708
Just three weeks in July.

158
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,910
Shouldn't we kiss or
shake hands or something?

159
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,813
Let's save it
for when you leave.

160
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,919
I made a 1:30 reservation
for lunch. Is that all right?

161
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,322
Just, uh, give me a minute.

162
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:34,424
When you haven't seen
your ex-husband in nine years,

163
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:37,860
your eyes have to... adjust.

164
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,062
I love your California clothes.

165
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:41,531
They're Bloomingdales
of New York.

166
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:46,202
It's the best place
for California clothes.

167
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:49,240
My god, you look so...

168
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,842
I don't know. What is the
word I'm looking for?

169
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,410
Happy.

170
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,312
Casual.

171
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:56,580
You never know out here.

172
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,016
Are you dressed up now,
or is that sporty?

173
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,186
I didn't think a tie
was necessary for a reunion.

174
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,054
Is that what this is?

175
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,456
When you walked in like that,

176
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:07,324
I thought we were
gonna play tennis.

177
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,527
You certainly look
fit enough for it.

178
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:13,298
"Fit."
You think I look fit?

179
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,233
You awful shit.
I look gorgeous.

180
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,101
Yes, you do, Hannah.

181
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,937
Your tan, of course, is perfect.

182
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:24,142
I always wondered how you got
the back of your ears so dark.

183
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,543
You put the top of your car down

184
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:27,912
and drive away from the sun.

185
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:29,281
Look, if we're gonna
banter like this,

186
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,716
give me a little time.

187
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,385
After nine years,
I'm a little rusty.

188
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,153
Oh, you'll pick it
right up again.

189
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,521
It's like French.

190
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,190
You see, that's what I'd miss

191
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,625
if I ever left New York...
The bantering.

192
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,228
San Francisco's
only an hour away.

193
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,230
We go up there
and banter in emergencies.

194
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,565
I never liked San Francisco.
I was always afraid

195
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,802
I'd fall out of bed and
roll down one of those hills.

196
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,772
Not you, Hannah.
You roll up hills.

197
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,277
Oh, good.
You're bantering.

198
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,346
The flight out
wasn't a total loss.

199
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,749
I detect a bit of snip
in the air.

200
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:06,653
Does that mean your conversation with
Jenny wasn't all that successful?

201
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,789
Oh, I don't know. I thought that we
glared at each other rather well.

202
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,325
I ordered a drink before lunch.

203
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,427
I thought one of us
might be a little nervous.

204
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,297
I gave up double scotches
on the rocks six years ago.

205
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,033
I'm big on apple juice
these days.

206
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,636
Well, I guess I'm
the one that's nervous.

207
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:30,245
It's obvious this place
agrees with you, bill.

208
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:32,713
Or do they call you Billy?

209
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,516
That's right. Jenny told me.
Everybody calls you Billy.

210
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:39,255
- That's me, Billy.
- It's just adorable.

211
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,590
Forty-four-year-old Billy
standing there

212
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,927
in his cute little sneakers
and sweater.

213
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:47,296
Better sit down, Billy.

214
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:49,398
You're making me feel
like your math teacher.

215
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:55,170
I promised myself driving
over here I would be pleasant.

216
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:57,005
I am now being pleasant.

217
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:58,341
You drive everywhere, do you?

218
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:01,344
- Everywhere.
- Even to your car?

219
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:03,980
If we're going,
I think we'd better get started.

220
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,548
You have changed, Billy.

221
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:07,817
You know, you don't get rattled
as easily as you used to.

222
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:10,620
Well, they don't have
as many rattlers out here.

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,556
Maybe this lunch won't be
as dull as I thought.

224
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:28,306
Marvin!
Hey, Marvin!

225
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,875
- Harry!
- Hey!

226
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:34,278
Hey, boy!

227
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:37,247
Harry.

228
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:44,055
You-you got so bald.
How did you get so bald?

229
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:46,858
You don't see your brother in five
years, that's all you gotta say?

230
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,061
I didn't even know it was
you, you got so bald.

231
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:54,132
- Where's Millie?
- She's coming in on the morning plane.

232
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:58,036
We don't like to fly together
on account of the kids.

233
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:00,439
You got so bald!

234
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:03,242
Hey, Marvin, take a gander.

235
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:07,212
Hmm? Oh, I'd give up two years of my
life for one hour with each of them.

236
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:11,451
You still haven't changed,
have you?

237
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,686
Let's say "hello."
Let's see how far we can get.

238
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:16,489
Hey, don't start in
with me, Harry.

239
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,724
I'm here one night without Millie.
Don't get me into trouble.

240
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,086
Would I do that to you?

241
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:22,852
You did it to papa when
he was 82 years old.

242
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,065
Don't do it to me.

243
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,669
- Oh, miss? You...
- Stop already with the girls!

244
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,672
Your kid is getting
bar mitzvahed tomorrow.

245
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:35,175
Hey, stop it. What is this,
a jogging outfit?

246
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:36,677
That's what we do here.

247
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:39,112
Jenny tells me you've moved.

248
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:40,347
You're not in
Hardy canyon anymore.

249
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,349
Laurel.
Laurel canyon.

250
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,785
Laurel, Hardy, what the hell.

251
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:47,389
She says it's sort of
a small French farmhouse...

252
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,056
With a little water mill
in back...

253
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,459
- And the sweetest little tennis court.
- That's right.

254
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,027
Sounds awfully rugged.

255
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:56,698
Well, we're from pioneer
stock out here in the west.

256
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,566
There's a glass house
two blocks down the road

257
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,202
if you want to throw
some more stones.

258
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:03,170
Maybe I'll just drop something
from the plane

259
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,708
when I leave tonight...
With Jenny.

260
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:11,747
This is very familiar.

261
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,749
Yeah. The house we rented

262
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,785
the year before Jenny was born
is just down the road there.

263
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:23,025
That wasn't
a bad summer, was it?

264
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,693
I thought it was terrific.

265
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:26,962
Yes, well, the pacific ocean

266
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:29,932
was a lot more interesting
in those days.

267
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:36,239
- No, thank you.
- No cigarettes either?

268
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:38,207
No, I gave them up
eight years ago.

269
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:41,645
Don't you miss the coughing
and the hacking in the morning?

270
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:45,982
It woke the dogs up.
I have dogs now.

271
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,017
Isn't divorce wonderful?

272
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,855
You have changed, Billy.
You've gone clean on me.

273
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:57,061
Tell me, what else do you do to
keep that winsome adolescent look?

274
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:01,466
You're just dying to make a
little fun of me, aren't you?

275
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,734
No, I don't mind.
I have an hour to kill.

276
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:06,471
Would you believe I, uh, I run
five miles every morning?

277
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:09,840
- After what? Oh.
- After a good night's sleep.

278
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,743
I don't even have a pill in my medicine
cabinet, and I gave up analysis.

279
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:16,247
- Oh, I heard that. Why did you quit?
- I went sane.

280
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:20,118
Sane? My god.
How boring.

281
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:23,054
Tell me something, Billy,
don't you ever get depressed?

282
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,991
- Yes.
- When?

283
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,760
Now.

284
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:33,499
And I, uh, I hear
you went in for an operation.

285
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,503
A hysterectomy.
It was nothing.

286
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:38,938
I have them every year.

287
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,108
I understood you had,
uh, prostate trouble.

288
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,776
Small world, isn't it?

289
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,946
Well, our past sins do have a
way of catching up with us.

290
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,415
Jenny tells me
you have a new boyfriend.

291
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:51,951
No.

292
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:56,055
- I have a lover. Jenny has boyfriends.
- Oh.

293
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,258
A writer in the
Washington post, I'm told.

294
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:58,983
Mm-hmm.

295
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,895
He's 54 years old,
he has a heart condition,

296
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:05,666
asthma, leans toward alcoholism.

297
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,434
He also has the second-best mind

298
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:10,137
I've met in this country
since Adlai Stevenson.

299
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,241
What's with you mate-wise?

300
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,111
"Mate-wise"?

301
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:21,683
Mate-wise, I'm seeing
a very nice girl.

302
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:25,887
Are you? Where are
you seeing her to?

303
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:29,057
Come on, Hannah.

304
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,194
I beg your pardon.
Have I offended you?

305
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:35,463
My god, it's a long time
since I've been involved

306
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:37,131
in a smart-ass conversation.

307
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:39,568
I'm sorry, but you're the
one that said things like,

308
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:40,902
"I hear you have a boyfriend,"

309
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:43,005
and "I'm seeing
a very nice girl."

310
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:44,607
I'm not the one with
the Bobsey twin haircut

311
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,742
and the Peter Pan phraseology.

312
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:49,311
I can see you've really come
to hunt bear, haven't you?

313
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,013
Hunt bear?

314
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,749
Is that what you said?
"Hunt bear"?

315
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,818
Is that the kind of nifty
conversation you have

316
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:58,588
around the campfires out here
in the rugged west?

317
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:01,657
Can we talk about Jenny?

318
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,326
What's your rush?
She's only 17.

319
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:06,329
She has her whole life
ahead of her.

320
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:09,633
If I'm gonna turn my daughter
over to you, which I am not,

321
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,802
at least I wanna know
what you're like.

322
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,204
Jenny is our daughter.
Ours.

323
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:15,906
Maybe. We'll see.

324
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:18,642
They've been a little slow
with the blood test.

325
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,112
Christ.
Five million cigarettes...

326
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,680
Are murder on the lungs.

327
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,917
Oh!

328
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:28,886
When you were younger, you were the
healthiest girl I knew. What happened?

329
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:32,256
With Nixon in the white house, good
health seemed to be in bad taste.

330
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:38,796
Your friend's about
a size too small for me.

331
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:42,700
How does she fit you?

332
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,902
Nicely, thank you.

333
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:47,305
Is this the neophyte actress
with the golden hair

334
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,742
Jenny's been telling me about?

335
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:53,746
- Am I being too nosy?
- Not for a Newsweek editor.

336
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:56,682
Yes, she is, and she's
a damned good actress.

337
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,717
Married before:
Has a nine-year-old boy.

338
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:02,721
Really? Should make
a nice pet for Jenny.

339
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,925
Is marriage contemplated?

340
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:10,529
It's contemplated. It's being
discussed and seriously considered.

341
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,666
And we all get along like clams.

342
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:17,003
Right. And would there be room for all
of you in the little French farmhouse?

343
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:19,839
Or will you have to take a Moroccan
villa on Wilshire boulevard?

344
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:24,678
What the hell
are you so bitter about?

345
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:26,179
You used to be bright and witty,

346
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,014
and now you're just
snide and sarcastic.

347
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:31,085
It comes with age. When you
don't have a fastball anymore,

348
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:33,821
you go to
change-ups and sliders.

349
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,328
Can we go? I feel like we're
playing from here to eternity.

350
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,312
- Pretty girl.
- I think so.

351
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:58,613
I suppose if Jenny stays,

352
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:00,615
she'll grow up
to look like that...

353
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:04,619
Blonde hair, blonde teeth,
blonde life.

354
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,454
God, I can just hear
the quips flying

355
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:07,856
when you and
the second-best mind

356
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:10,125
since Adlai Stevenson
get together.

357
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,960
Sitting there freezing
under a blanket

358
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,463
at the Washington
redskins games,

359
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:19,601
playing anagrams with the names
of all the Polish players.

360
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:21,771
Your mind clicks off
bric-a-brac so goddamn fast,

361
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:24,240
it never has a chance for an honest
emotion or thought ever to get through.

362
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,876
And you're so filled
with honest emotion,

363
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:29,779
you fall in love every time
someone sings a ballad.

364
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:33,449
You're worse than a hopeless romantic.
You're a hopeful one.

365
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:37,087
You're the kind of man who would
end the world famine problem

366
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:39,089
by having them all eat out,

367
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,458
preferably at a good
Chinese restaurant.

368
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,295
Oh, for god's sake, Hannah.
Let's stop this crap.

369
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,334
I don't know if your bitterness
is because Jenny ran away

370
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:53,804
or because she ran away
to somebody whose lifestyle

371
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:57,175
epitomizes everything
you consider cheap and banal.

372
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:00,011
I don't have a lifestyle.
I have a life.

373
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,550
You have no legal rights
to her. You understand that?

374
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,853
- Certainly.
- Then tell her to come home with me.

375
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,623
I did. She would like to
try it with me for a year.

376
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:14,458
She's not happy
in New York, Hannah.

377
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,428
Nobody's happy in New York,
but they're alive.

378
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,800
What a snob you are.

379
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,569
Thank god there's
a few of us left.

380
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:28,073
What is there so
beautiful about your life

381
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:30,209
that makes it so important
to put down everyone else's?

382
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,513
New York is not the center
of the goddamn universe.

383
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:38,483
I Grant you, it's an exciting,
vibrant, stimulating, fabulous city,

384
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,686
but it is not mecca.

385
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:42,055
It just smells like it.

386
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,657
To hell with New York
or Boston or Washington.

387
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:47,828
I don't care where Jenny lives.
I care how.

388
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,430
She's a bright girl
with an intelligent mind.

389
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,733
Let it grow and prosper. What the hell
is she gonna learn in a community

390
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:57,170
whose greatest literary achievement
is the map of the movie stars' homes?

391
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,873
Tell me about it, Hannah.

392
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:04,378
Tell me about the political elite
on Martha's vineyard in July.

393
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:06,948
I remember vividly
those charity luncheons

394
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:10,251
to raise money for
the California grape pickers.

395
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:12,053
A teeming mob of women
who must have spent

396
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:14,288
$12,000 on Gucci pants

397
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:17,624
so they could raise 2,000
for the grape pickers.

398
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:21,195
Why the hell didn't they just
mail them the pants?

399
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:27,135
You were terrific when
you used to write like that.

400
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:28,503
I haven't seen your newest film.

401
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:32,440
I'm told it grossed very well
in backward areas.

402
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,843
Jesus. Was I anything
like you before?

403
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:37,245
I couldn't hold a candle to you.

404
00:23:37,345 --> 00:23:39,614
No wonder nobody here talked
to me for the first two years.

405
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,416
Lucky you.

406
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:45,387
Look, we have
to settle this today.

407
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:49,392
If you respect Jenny as a person, then
respect her right to make a free choice.

408
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:51,827
You get her for the summers.
That's enough.

409
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:55,098
It takes me the other ten months of the
year to get the seaweed out of her brains.

410
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,001
How much time do you
spend with her?

411
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:01,337
How often do you have
breakfast with her?

412
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:04,908
How many nights a week
does she eat dinner alone?

413
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:08,545
You really think she's happy
with that $20 bill you give her

414
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:11,916
every time you go off to
Washington for the weekend?

415
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:17,587
The girl is growing up
lonely, Hannah,

416
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:21,892
and she's flown out here on her
own savings to prove it to you.

417
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:23,894
She has two dogs,
a Dominican cook,

418
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:27,831
and every good-looking boy in the senior
class living off my refrigerator.

419
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:32,003
Despite her Gothic reports, she is
not living the life of Jane Eyre.

420
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,007
Would you like to know what
Jenny has to say about you?

421
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,509
She told me. She thinks
I'm a son of a bitch.

422
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,113
She also thinks
I'm a funny son of a bitch.

423
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,749
She loves me, but she doesn't like me.
She's afraid of me.

424
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,385
She's intimidated by me.
She respects me,

425
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,121
but she doesn't wanna
become like me.

426
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,458
We have a perfectly normal
mother-daughter relationship.

427
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,460
How the hell
can you be so flippant

428
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,862
when it comes to your
own daughter's well-being?

429
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,697
And how the hell
can you be so pompous

430
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:03,435
not to recognize a perfectly normal,
rebellious attitude in a young girl?

431
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:07,473
If she didn't complain, I'd probably
send her to an expensive shrink.

432
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,609
Since she's with me
ten months of the year,

433
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,281
it is only normal you're the
one she's going to miss.

434
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:17,284
I think by and large she and I
have managed quite well.

435
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:20,587
But like all young girls,
she needs a father image.

436
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:24,424
I don't mind. If it's only July and
August, it might as well be you.

437
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,660
This is April, and she came
out without your permission.

438
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,662
She never had
a good head for dates.

439
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,199
What would you do if
I just keep her here with me?

440
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:35,036
I will call my friend, the Attorney
General of the United States,

441
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:38,372
if she's not on
the 9:00 plane tonight.

442
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,241
Why didn't you ever run
for office, Hannah?

443
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:42,643
I always thought you'd have made
a hell of a governor.

444
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,248
I don't think a Democratic
system really works.

445
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,984
Offer me a monarchy,
and we'll talk.

446
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:53,887
It's 2:30.
Will you call Jenny or shall I?

447
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:55,423
No.

448
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:57,559
No, what?

449
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,394
No, sir.

450
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:10,839
The truth, Hannah.

451
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:13,075
You know if we leave it up to Jenny,
you don't stand a chance in hell

452
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:14,676
of getting her on that plane.

453
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:17,546
Certainly. Why else
would the ninny run away?

454
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:19,849
Who said we don't have problems?
She is 17 years old,

455
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:23,086
and when we go at each other, she
needs another shoulder to cry on.

456
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:26,322
But I'll be goddamned if
I'm gonna give up a daughter

457
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:29,559
for a pink cashmere shoulder
three thousand miles away.

458
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:33,863
This is an event.

459
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:37,133
It's the first time in my life
I've ever seen you so nervous.

460
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:40,437
I'm not nervous.

461
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:42,373
I'm scared to death.

462
00:26:42,473 --> 00:26:45,976
That's good of you to admit it.

463
00:26:46,077 --> 00:26:48,779
But honesty always was
one of your strengths.

464
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:54,951
You're pretty cute yourself.
I mean it.

465
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:58,889
Oh, why do men have to get better
looking when they get older?

466
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:01,492
Remind me to bring it up with
the equal rights commission.

467
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:04,329
So where are the stars?
I don't see any stars yet.

468
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:06,364
They come out at night.

469
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:10,502
I'll pick you up for dinner
at 6:30 in front of the hotel.

470
00:27:10,602 --> 00:27:12,870
Suit and tie,
or sloppy like you?

471
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,573
Look at that beauty. Mmm!

472
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:17,475
They fall out of the trees
here like oranges.

473
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:21,713
Lucky thing I didn't move out here.
I'd be bald, like you.

474
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:25,118
How come you're so preoccupied
with sex, sex, sex?

475
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:27,186
I thought all that jogging,
you'd forget about sex.

476
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,222
- You know something better?
- Thank you.

477
00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:30,523
Here you go. Thanks.

478
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:32,325
You're still the same...
Girls, girls, girls.

479
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:34,760
You fall apart every time
you see a tuchas.

480
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:44,103
Hello?

481
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,474
Oh, yes.
How are you?

482
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:51,245
Well, she's a bit nervous,
I think.

483
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:54,614
Do you really think she will?
Well, let's hope so.

484
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,385
Oh, yes, and, uh, thank you for
the flowers and for the fruit

485
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:01,054
and for the lovely suite
and for the caviar

486
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:04,358
and for everything else
you send up by the hour.

487
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,795
One moment, Joe.
Diana, it's Joe Pickman.

488
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,165
Tell him I'm in the can.

489
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:16,404
The man has paid for this trip,
he's paid for this suite.

490
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:19,073
He's given you the best part
you've had in five years.

491
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:22,177
I am not gonna tell him
you're in the can.

492
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:24,679
Then I'll tell him.

493
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,448
Joe, darling.

494
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:31,687
I told Sidney to tell you
I was in the can.

495
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:34,923
I didn't want to speak
to you, that's why.

496
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,958
Well, because I feel
so responsible.

497
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:40,061
I don't want to
let you down tonight.

498
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:42,331
I know how much this film
means to you,

499
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:45,567
and I want so much
to win this award for you, Joe.

500
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:49,438
No, there was
no picture without you.

501
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:51,674
Well, goddamn it, it's true.

502
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,643
After four studios
turned it down,

503
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:57,614
you deserve some
special perseverance award.

504
00:28:57,714 --> 00:29:01,818
You're a chubby little man,
and I adore you.

505
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:05,054
If I win tonight, darling,

506
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:08,358
it's not going to be an Oscar.

507
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,597
It's going to be a...
Joe Pickman.

508
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:18,669
You're an angel.

509
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:23,341
- That was very sweet.
- Did you like it, dear?

510
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:25,909
That's gonna be
my acceptance speech.

511
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,350
Your acceptance speech?

512
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,171
All except the part
that I was in the can.

513
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:33,116
Well, naturally, you and I know

514
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:34,452
I don't have a hope in hell,

515
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:37,021
but you have to prepare
something.

516
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:40,859
You can't just stand there
sobbing all over Burt Reynolds.

517
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:43,695
You've got as much chance
as anyone else.

518
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:50,235
No, I... I don't have
the sentiment on my side.

519
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:53,272
You've got to have
a sentimental reason

520
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:55,740
for them to vote for you.

521
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:59,945
Any decent actress
can give a good performance,

522
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:03,883
but a dying husband, that
would have insured everything.

523
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:07,353
You wouldn't like to get
something fatal for me,

524
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:08,888
would you, angel?

525
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:10,122
You should've told me sooner.

526
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,924
I could've come over
on the Hindenburg.

527
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:18,332
We are dreadful,
aren't we, Sidney?

528
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,367
God will punish us.

529
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,736
I think he already has.

530
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:28,342
Let's do something naughty.

531
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:30,911
You always think of such
good naughty things to do.

532
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:34,214
- I was naughty all day yesterday.
- Not with me, you weren't.

533
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:36,683
You'll just have to learn
to show up on time.

534
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:52,300
Well, except for an extremely critical
decision that's still to be made,

535
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,636
it's been a nice day.

536
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:59,874
What do you say, Hannah?

537
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,415
I'm out of cigarettes.

538
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,886
I can't be expected to give up
my daughter and cigarettes

539
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:12,788
on the same day.

540
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:18,594
Goddamn it!

541
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:33,377
I only have
one more year with her.

542
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,413
Next September,
she's gonna go to college.

543
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:40,850
She's gonna come out in four
years a revolutionary or a nun.

544
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,588
Or worse, like you or me.

545
00:31:44,688 --> 00:31:47,992
A little bit of both
wouldn't be so bad.

546
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,930
Do you like your mother?

547
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,099
My mother?
She's dead.

548
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:58,936
Don't quibble.
Did you like her?

549
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:02,907
Yes, I liked her.

550
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:05,810
I don't like mine much.

551
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,015
Can you imagine being a pain
in the ass for 78 years?

552
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:12,017
I knew there was something wrong
even when I was in the womb.

553
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:15,153
I never felt comfortable.

554
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:17,889
I think I was hanging too low.

555
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,398
We shouldn't have had Jenny.

556
00:32:26,498 --> 00:32:29,769
People like you and me,
we're too selfish.

557
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:34,941
And I...
I don't want her...

558
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,543
To grow up hating me,

559
00:32:36,643 --> 00:32:38,745
and I don't wanna see her
growing up out here

560
00:32:38,845 --> 00:32:41,714
'cause I'm scared
I'm gonna hate her.

561
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:50,156
I know. Maybe you and I
should've stayed together.

562
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:53,226
We could've... We could've let
Jenny go, huh? What do you think?

563
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:57,965
I think you're still one of the most
interesting women I've ever met.

564
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:04,705
He's not gonna live long,
you know.

565
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:09,710
- Who isn't?
- My friend at the Washington post.

566
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:13,081
He had open-heart surgery
that was a total waste of time.

567
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:19,921
I'm sorry to hear that.

568
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,956
So am I.

569
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:25,494
The man could really
make me laugh.

570
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,431
Oh, well,
you win some, lose some.

571
00:33:30,532 --> 00:33:34,537
Talk about resiliency.

572
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,439
Oh. For a smart lady
in a man's world,

573
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,842
I'm not doing so bad.

574
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:50,152
Tell me something, bill.
Is being in love better now?

575
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,657
Yes.

576
00:33:55,791 --> 00:34:00,030
- Why?
- Because it's now.

577
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,467
Oh, Christ.

578
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:10,140
I can't wait
to become a grandmother.

579
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,676
I think I screwed up
the first time around.

580
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,987
Yes.

581
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,125
I see.

582
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:32,496
Yeah, I understand.

583
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,634
No, no, no.
I'll take care of it.

584
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:40,105
Ok, bye-bye.

585
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:43,676
It's Jenny. She's downstairs
with her bags packed.

586
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:46,178
She says it's up to us.

587
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:48,346
She'll abide by
whatever decision we both make.

588
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:50,182
And you agreed?

589
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:52,751
Certainly.

590
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:55,287
Oh, what a cunning
bastard you are.

591
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,723
If we say she goes back to New York,
she's gonna think I coerced you.

592
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:00,058
We say she stays here, she's gonna think
I didn't even put up a fight for her.

593
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:02,528
You think she has
that devious a mind?

594
00:35:02,629 --> 00:35:04,097
Of course.
She's my daughter.

595
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:05,732
I don't suppose
you'd consider spending

596
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,901
ten months
of the year back east?

597
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:10,670
Only if everyone there leaves.

598
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:15,709
You want me to make it
easy for you, Hannah?

599
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,443
I'll throw in my vote.

600
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:21,547
Whatever you say goes, and I'll tell
Jenny we both made the decision.

601
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:25,786
Oh, Jesus. No wonder there's so
many used car salesmen out here.

602
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:33,493
How much time do I have? I've
always panicked at deadlines.

603
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:36,096
As much time as you want.

604
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,632
Is it only from here
she looks so small to me?

605
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:15,204
I say she goes back.

606
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:17,874
I see.

607
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:20,609
All right, then she goes back.

608
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:23,880
You think I'm wrong, don't you?

609
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,215
I'm disappointed,
but I trust your instincts.

610
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:28,385
If you feel it's right,
I have enough faith in Jenny

611
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,053
that she'll see it too.

612
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:32,690
I'm...

613
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:39,029
I'm so afraid
I'm going to lose her, bill.

614
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:49,539
What are you looking at?

615
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,944
This is a new color for you...
Vulnerable.

616
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,645
Well, take a picture of it,

617
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,315
'cause you're not
gonna see it again.

618
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,087
Keep her.
What?

619
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,959
I said, keep her.

620
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,661
But for six months, not a year.

621
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,208
And I get to choose the school,

622
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:15,124
and any school I choose has
to give me three references.

623
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:17,569
God, what am I doing?

624
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:21,406
Stay the weekend, Hannah.
Talk it over again with Jenny.

625
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,243
You don't have to make a decision
just because you got a plane ticket.

626
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,645
I'm a fighter, Billy.
If I stay the weekend,

627
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,365
I'll not only take
Jenny back with me,

628
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,506
I might take your goddamn
girlfriend back too.

629
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,284
Don't let me bully you
into this, Hannah.

630
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:35,088
Look, why can't the three
of us talk it out?

631
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:37,457
- I'm gonna get Jenny up here.
- No, goddamn it!

632
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:41,161
If I have to give her up to get
her back, then let's do it.

633
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:44,297
You never stop
amazing me, Hannah.

634
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:50,837
I'll tell you one thing. You're not
the same woman I left nine years ago.

635
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,807
And I'm missing
the ovaries to prove it.

636
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,782
Well, guess who's
nonplussed now?

637
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:04,952
You never thought
I'd say "yes," did you?

638
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,454
Keep up that
pioneer spirit, Billy.

639
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:09,590
You're gonna need it raising
a 17-year-old daughter.

640
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,393
I think you're doing
a terrific thing, Hannah.

641
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:14,896
So do I.

642
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,869
I suppose you wanna
see her before you go?

643
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,157
Well, you suppose wrong.

644
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:21,503
I've seen her. I'll call her
when I get to New York.

645
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:23,939
Bell captain, please.

646
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,841
What should I tell her?

647
00:38:25,941 --> 00:38:27,709
Tell her I hope
she'll be very happy

648
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,545
and I'm selling
her record collection.

649
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:34,149
Would you send someone up
for the luggage, room 306?

650
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:35,884
Thank you.

651
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:39,422
You know, we couldn't
have been too bad together.

652
00:38:39,522 --> 00:38:40,857
We produced a hell of a girl.

653
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:42,491
I think you have that
a little wrong.

654
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:45,862
I think the two of you
produced a hell of a mother.

655
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:49,933
Maybe you're right.

656
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:54,103
Um, can we shake hands now?
I'm about to leave.

657
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:58,107
Sure.
What more can I lose?

658
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,499
N-no...

659
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:28,073
Serve her plenty
of broccoli and Lima beans.

660
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:30,976
- She likes them?
- She hates them.

661
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,378
But from now on, what do I care?

662
00:39:34,946 --> 00:39:38,816
Good-bye, Hannah. It was
very good seeing you again.

663
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,719
I feel like a...
Like an artist

664
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:44,891
about to part with a painting
that she doesn't want to sell.

665
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:47,659
I'll frame it and keep it
in a good light.

666
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:50,029
Do that.

667
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,100
Take care of my daughter too.

668
00:40:38,379 --> 00:40:40,481
Bye.

669
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,293
What do you mean, just one room?
There are two reservations.

670
00:40:51,393 --> 00:40:55,264
Dr. and Mrs. Willis Panama,
Dr. and Mrs. Chauncey Gump.

671
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,366
I have here one deluxe room,
double bed,

672
00:40:57,466 --> 00:40:59,343
for Dr. and Mrs. Panama
on the 3rd, 4th and 5th.

673
00:40:59,368 --> 00:40:59,993
Yes.

674
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:01,836
I have nothing
for a Dr. Gump.

675
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:05,040
There must be a clerical error
or an omission of intelligence,

676
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,376
because my travel agent
made the reservation.

677
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:10,512
Now, he's my wife's brother,
and he's also my patient.

678
00:41:10,612 --> 00:41:11,781
I wish you'd
double-check it.

679
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:13,849
I already double-checked
our files.

680
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,151
Here's the telegram we received.

681
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,053
You can see for yourself.

682
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:19,322
Yes, I can see that my name
is missing from this wire.

683
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:21,891
But as you can see, I'm not
missing from your hotel.

684
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:24,060
Now, there's four of us,
and we need two rooms.

685
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,129
I don't have two rooms available.
I'm sorry.

686
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:28,999
- It's academy award week.
- We don't care who wins.

687
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,600
We just wanna get into bed.

688
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,335
I do have a small single.

689
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:34,538
However, there is
some repair going on.

690
00:41:34,638 --> 00:41:36,273
It's not terribly comfortable,

691
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:38,342
but I can squeeze
a small daybed in.

692
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:40,944
I'm sorry, but it's
the best I can do.

693
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:42,779
Well, what do we do?

694
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:45,616
I'm not gonna stand around here with
whiplash and argue with the man.

695
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:48,519
I'm gonna check in
to the Hilton. Let's go, baby.

696
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:50,387
Well, it's our last
few days of vacation.

697
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:52,523
I'd hate for us
not to be together.

698
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:54,591
What do you mean, "not be together"?
We're all gonna check into the Hilton.

699
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:57,962
Well, they do have a
reservation for the two of us.

700
00:41:58,063 --> 00:42:00,365
You wanna stay in this hotel after
the way they've been treatin' us?

701
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:02,434
Well, they're treatin'
me and Bettina all right.

702
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:04,169
I really had my heart
set on staying here.

703
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,071
It's so pretty here, Chauncey.

704
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:08,306
- Oh, listen. Listen.
- What?

705
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:12,044
Even a tiny room in this place
couldn't be too bad.

706
00:42:12,144 --> 00:42:15,947
And it's only for two nights.
Please, Chaunce?

707
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:17,916
Come on.

708
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:21,654
Ok.
Ok, ok.

709
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:23,089
We'll toss for the small room.

710
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:26,792
Why? I already
have my reservation.

711
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:29,662
Willis, you're not thinkin'
what I hope you're not thinkin'.

712
00:42:29,762 --> 00:42:31,564
I didn't make the reservation.
I don't see why

713
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:34,500
we have to suffer because
her brother is an idiot.

714
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,235
We see enough blood
in the hospital.

715
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:38,071
I don't wanna see any blood
in this hotel lobby.

716
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:40,807
Now, either we toss for the room,
goddamn it, or we toss for the room.

717
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:43,310
- Now, call it.
- I'm not tossing for any room.

718
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,513
I'm going up to my registered
room, sit in my reserved bath.

719
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:51,118
- Come on, honey.
- No, no. Take it easy.

720
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:53,687
- What time is it?
- What?

721
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:57,091
- What time is it?
- It's a quarter to 1:00.

722
00:42:57,191 --> 00:43:00,728
I want you to remember that time,
'cause that's when we declared war.

723
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,465
Yes, we'd like the court from
10:00 to 11:00 tomorrow morning.

724
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:07,102
And split the charges
with me and Dr. Gump.

725
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:11,139
Balls and everything.
All right, thank you.

726
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:14,509
We got it!
We are set, tomorrow morning.

727
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:17,778
And we're gonna cream 'em
six-love, six-love.

728
00:43:17,878 --> 00:43:21,182
- And if we have time...
- Six-love again.

729
00:43:32,394 --> 00:43:35,063
- Hello?
- Chaunce? Hi, buddy. What you doin'?

730
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:40,369
Oh, nothing much. Uh, just sittin'
here watchin' the toilet flush.

731
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:42,571
It's been flushing about two hours
now, wouldn't you say, hon?

732
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:45,608
Well, that's too bad. You and
Lola wanna use our John?

733
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:49,579
Nah. We were thinkin' about waitin'
till we get back to Chicago.

734
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:50,647
Well, we're all set.

735
00:43:50,747 --> 00:43:53,483
Tomorrow morning, 10:00 am.
How's that?

736
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,353
Fine, fine.

737
00:43:56,453 --> 00:43:59,122
Sneakers'll be a little damp
though, but you won't mind.

738
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,990
What time we going
to the Greek restaurant?

739
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,361
Lola wants to know what time we're
going to the Greek restaurant.

740
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:07,030
Oh, didn't I tell you?
Bettina felt like Japanese,

741
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:09,267
so I booked Fujiyama's
for 7:30.

742
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,702
We'll see you
down in the lobby, 7:15.

743
00:44:11,802 --> 00:44:13,704
Now, don't be late, ya hear?

744
00:44:13,804 --> 00:44:16,140
Fine.

745
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:21,979
That man will never
get to Chicago alive.

746
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,015
The, uh, real dark horse
in this year's Oscar derby

747
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:27,151
seems to be Diana Barrie,

748
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:29,954
one of the most respected actresses in
the business and perhaps best known...

749
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:32,457
For her portrayals of
Shakespearean queens

750
00:44:32,557 --> 00:44:35,694
and Pinter heroines at
London's national theatre.

751
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:37,996
- Diana is up for her first Oscar...
- Hello?

752
00:44:38,096 --> 00:44:40,632
In the funny but featherweight comedy
that might have slipped by unnoticed...

753
00:44:40,732 --> 00:44:45,204
Oh, yes. Yes. We'll be down
in about, uh, five minutes.

754
00:44:45,304 --> 00:44:47,071
Thank you.

755
00:44:47,172 --> 00:44:50,042
- Sidney?
- Yes?

756
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:52,845
Sidney, take a look...

757
00:44:52,945 --> 00:44:56,849
And-and try
to be gentle.

758
00:44:56,949 --> 00:44:59,785
Channel two just picked you
as a dark horse.

759
00:44:59,885 --> 00:45:03,956
- They must have seen the dress.
- You hate it.

760
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:07,260
- How much was it?
- Nothing. Joe Pickman paid for it.

761
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,562
- Then I love it.
- Damn it.

762
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:12,533
I wish you didn't have
such good taste.

763
00:45:14,835 --> 00:45:19,506
I have a definite hump
on my left shoulder.

764
00:45:19,606 --> 00:45:23,210
It cost 500 pounds,
and I look like Richard III.

765
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,979
Do you notice the hump, Sidney?

766
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,749
Isn't that your regular hump?

767
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:31,952
Don't joke with me. I am going
on national television.

768
00:45:32,052 --> 00:45:34,021
There are no humps.

769
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:36,157
I can see no humps
at this particular time.

770
00:45:36,258 --> 00:45:39,294
I should've worn
something simple.

771
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:41,796
My black pantsuit.

772
00:45:41,896 --> 00:45:44,699
Why the hell didn't I wear
my black pantsuit?

773
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:47,469
- Because I am wearing it.
- We should never have come.

774
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:50,104
I never know how to dress
in this bloody country.

775
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:52,039
It's so easy
to dress in England.

776
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:54,743
You just put on warm clothing.

777
00:45:54,843 --> 00:45:58,447
- Why did we come, Sidney?
- Because it's free, darling.

778
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,449
Glenda Jackson never comes.

779
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,786
She's nominated
every goddamn year.

780
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,390
We could have stayed in London
and waited for a telephone call.

781
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,592
David Niven could have
accepted for me.

782
00:46:09,692 --> 00:46:11,294
He'd have been bright and witty,

783
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,995
and no one would've
noticed my hump.

784
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:15,864
Use it, sweetheart. People will
pity you for your deformity,

785
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:17,701
and you're sure to win.

786
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:20,637
Maybe if you put
your arm on my shoulder.

787
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,706
Keep your arm on my shoulder
at all times.

788
00:46:22,806 --> 00:46:27,411
If I win we'll go up together,
your arm around me.

789
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:30,280
They'll think we're still mad
for each other after 12 years.

790
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,283
Oh, I thought we were.
I keep forgetting.

791
00:46:33,383 --> 00:46:35,184
How many gin and tonics
have you had?

792
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:37,754
- Three gins and one tonic.
- Catch up on the tonics.

793
00:46:37,854 --> 00:46:40,825
We don't want to be
disgusting tonight, do we?

794
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:46,063
What's wrong with my hair?

795
00:46:46,163 --> 00:46:48,633
I look like
I've combed it with a towel.

796
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:52,370
When you played Elizabeth you looked like
a warthog, and you never complained once.

797
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,439
That was acting.
This is living.

798
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:57,007
Living, I want to be beautiful.

799
00:46:57,107 --> 00:47:00,512
It's the strangest color.
I asked for a simple rinse,

800
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:03,281
and that ditsy queen's
given me crayon.

801
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:05,384
Shall I walk with my arm
on your head as well?

802
00:47:05,484 --> 00:47:09,888
Oh, Christ. I hate
getting dressed like this.

803
00:47:09,988 --> 00:47:12,991
Why is it I'm always perfectly
comfortable as somebody else?

804
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,461
I'd have been perfectly happy
going as Hedda Gabler.

805
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:19,365
- Try Quasimodo.
- Try shutting up!

806
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:23,536
Now, check me out.
Do I have too much jewelry on?

807
00:47:23,636 --> 00:47:25,505
Jingle it. I can't tell
if I don't hear it.

808
00:47:25,605 --> 00:47:28,174
Will you please be nice to me and
pay me one bloody compliment?

809
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:31,611
I've been getting ready for this
horseshit affair for three hours.

810
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:34,414
- Diana, you're just...
- What? What?

811
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:37,149
I was...

812
00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:40,252
I was just gonna say you're making
a mountain out of a molehill.

813
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:42,321
But I didn't think
it would amuse you.

814
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:44,492
That's not funny, Sidney.

815
00:47:44,592 --> 00:47:47,928
That's bizarre.
Give me a drink.

816
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:52,566
You have the most bizarre
sense of humor.

817
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:55,002
Bizarre people often do.

818
00:47:57,638 --> 00:47:59,540
Give me a bit more.
It's all right.

819
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,542
I won't get pissed
till after I lose.

820
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:03,811
- The car is waiting.
- Oh, god.

821
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:07,215
Why do they have
these things so early?

822
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:11,185
I mean, no woman can look good
at 5:00 in the afternoon,

823
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:13,488
except possibly Tatum O'Neal.

824
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:16,257
- Finish your drink.
- Mmm.

825
00:48:16,357 --> 00:48:19,828
I don't want to miss
the sound editing awards.

826
00:48:19,928 --> 00:48:23,231
Oh, those bloody
photographers and newsmen.

827
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:27,737
I can't wait to see how they
explain my hump in the papers.

828
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:34,376
- Where are you going?
- I need another drink.

829
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:37,447
The last one
wore off in the lift.

830
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:43,486
- Gin and tonic, please.
- Nothing for me.

831
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:44,987
I heard that if you're late,

832
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:47,923
they put nondescript
people in your seats.

833
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:50,115
Do you know what I might
do next year, Sidney?

834
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,519
I pray anything but Ibsen.

835
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,930
I might give it all up.

836
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,533
It's no fun anymore.
Oh, god, how I envy you.

837
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,001
You're the one
with all the talent.

838
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,570
I'm the one who has to make
a horse's ass of myself.

839
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,238
Talent?
What talent do I have?

840
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:03,774
You have nothing but talent.

841
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,942
You cook better than I do,
you write better than I do.

842
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,944
God knows you dress
better than I do.

843
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:11,148
Better than "I."
The "do" is superfluous.

844
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,184
You speak better than I do...

845
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,252
What's that green slime
you're eating?

846
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,088
It looks like a dish
out of Oliver twist.

847
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:21,559
I'm not sure. I think they run the
front lawn through a blender.

848
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,695
You've got that glazed look
in your eye again, Sidney...

849
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,963
That "bored-with-her-life"
attitude.

850
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,766
I'm never bored
with your life, my angel.

851
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,035
I love the openings
and the parties.

852
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,940
I lead a very gay life.
Let's be honest, pet.

853
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,576
How many antique dealers get
to go to the academy awards?

854
00:49:37,676 --> 00:49:39,545
I think you hate
that dusty little shop.

855
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:41,947
- You're never there when I call.
- Could I, miss Barrie?

856
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,082
- It's for my daughter. Excuse me.
- Oh, certainly.

857
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:47,820
- What's her name?
- Uh... Just say, "to frank."

858
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:54,894
What do you do
with your afternoons, Sidney?

859
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:59,465
In London? I don't think
we have afternoons.

860
00:49:59,566 --> 00:50:02,468
- Gin and tonic...
- Check, please.

861
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:09,509
Come along.

862
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:14,781
You should never have
given it up, Sidney.

863
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:17,652
- What?
- Acting.

864
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:20,888
Christ, you were good. You had
more promise than any of us.

865
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:23,858
Really? I can't think
what it was I promised.

866
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,426
You were so gentle on the stage.

867
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,395
So unselfish, so giving.

868
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:30,998
You had a sweet, gentle quality.

869
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:34,001
Yes. I would've made
a wonderful Ophelia.

870
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:36,003
You could go back, Sidney,
if you wanted to.

871
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:38,406
We could do plays together,
have more time together.

872
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:44,045
No, there'd be problems. It would be awful
if we were both up for the same part.

873
00:50:44,145 --> 00:50:47,415
I'm perfectly happy selling
my 18th century door knockers.

874
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:50,586
You still haven't told me what
you do with your afternoons.

875
00:50:50,686 --> 00:50:53,254
I just told you,
I look for knockers.

876
00:50:56,925 --> 00:50:58,660
I think I got it stopped,
but you won't be able to use

877
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,730
the water in
the bathroom for a while.

878
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,999
Oh, it's ok. We have enough
on the floor to last us.

879
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:05,868
Thank you.

880
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:08,437
- Ok, hurry up.
- What? Lola...

881
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:12,909
The man is 20 minutes late.

882
00:51:13,009 --> 00:51:15,411
How would you like to be
lying on an operating table

883
00:51:15,511 --> 00:51:19,448
with tubes going in your nose,
waiting for him to show up?

884
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:21,819
Your brother's
gonna pay for this.

885
00:51:21,919 --> 00:51:23,654
I'm tired of being nice
to that man.

886
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:25,388
The next time
I take his x-rays,

887
00:51:25,488 --> 00:51:27,424
wait till I tell him
what I found on them.

888
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:28,792
My feet are still wet.

889
00:51:28,892 --> 00:51:30,293
The foot powder
is turning into concrete.

890
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:32,329
Nine Japanese restaurants
in ten nights?

891
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:34,898
I am sick and disgusted
of stepping on raw fish

892
00:51:34,998 --> 00:51:37,000
in my stocking feet that
that man drops on the floor.

893
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,937
Now, come on, woman.
This is Pearl harbor night.

894
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:47,311
- Can we get going? I'll drive.
- You'll what?

895
00:51:47,411 --> 00:51:49,513
- Do you know where Fujiyama's is?
- No.

896
00:51:49,614 --> 00:51:50,256
I'll drive.

897
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:52,207
Why don't you two argue in the back?
I'll drive.

898
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:56,988
- Ok, honey. - "Ok, honey"? Watch
out when he says, "ok, honey."

899
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:08,367
I feel like
a caged animal, Sidney.

900
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:10,736
They look as though they're
going to throw nuts at us.

901
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,706
Nonsense, darling.
They're just ogling us.

902
00:52:13,806 --> 00:52:16,241
- I adore being ogled, don't you?
- Oh, Sidney!

903
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,977
Yes?

904
00:52:18,077 --> 00:52:22,147
Sidney, kiss me.
Kiss me and wish me luck.

905
00:52:24,616 --> 00:52:26,018
There's your kiss.

906
00:52:26,118 --> 00:52:29,189
Now turn around so I can
rub your hump for luck.

907
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:34,360
Sidney, please be nice to me.
I'm scared to death.

908
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,863
I wish you everything.

909
00:52:36,963 --> 00:52:40,667
I wish you luck, I wish you
love, I wish you happiness.

910
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:42,736
You are a gifted
and remarkable woman.

911
00:52:42,836 --> 00:52:45,839
I hope you win the bloody Oscar.

912
00:52:45,939 --> 00:52:49,911
Fifty years from now, I'll be
able to sell it for a fortune.

913
00:52:51,612 --> 00:52:53,514
Just hold my hand, angel.

914
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:08,796
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

915
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:13,101
to again prove that the academy awards
are indeed international in scope,

916
00:53:13,201 --> 00:53:15,670
we're so pleased
to welcome here from London

917
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:18,240
the academy award nominee
for her best performance

918
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,476
in that wonderful picture
no right turns...

919
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:23,345
No, it's called no left turns.

920
00:53:23,445 --> 00:53:29,217
Miss Diana Barrie and her very
handsome husband, Mr. Sidney Barrie.

921
00:53:29,317 --> 00:53:30,418
Sidney Cochran.

922
00:53:30,518 --> 00:53:31,553
Sidney Cochran.

923
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:56,781
And you say when you put your foot
on the brakes, nothing happened?

924
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:57,982
I didn't say "nothing happened."

925
00:53:58,082 --> 00:53:59,784
I said that the brakes
didn't work.

926
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:01,051
When the brakes didn't work,

927
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:03,153
that's when
nothing good happened.

928
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:05,655
You snapped the cable
holding the cars.

929
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:08,392
I've never seen
anything like this in my life.

930
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:10,327
I thought it was a jet.

931
00:54:10,427 --> 00:54:14,464
I thought, "oh, god,
we've just been 747'd."

932
00:54:14,564 --> 00:54:16,267
My legs are paralyzed.

933
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:18,436
I can't move.
My legs are paralyzed.

934
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:20,872
Ok, we're gonna get you out
as fast as we can, all right?

935
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:24,442
It's not from the car. It's from
sittin' in a Japanese restaurant.

936
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:27,112
Hold on tight. I'll get you
a cup of coffee, all right?

937
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:39,992
Congratulations.

938
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:04,952
Come on.
It's after 3:00.

939
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,655
Don't give me that
superior-than-thou crap.

940
00:55:08,755 --> 00:55:11,091
You're stinking, aren't you?

941
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:14,694
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm a lady.

942
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:17,430
A loser and a lady.

943
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,800
One of the great
losing ladies of the cinema.

944
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:31,112
You remember that night
up in the Catskills

945
00:55:31,212 --> 00:55:34,015
when you ran away and
you came back an hour later

946
00:55:34,115 --> 00:55:36,517
because you stepped in
the cow doo-doo?

947
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:44,226
Oh, that was funny.
Whoo, am I tanked, Harry.

948
00:55:44,326 --> 00:55:45,861
Are you sure
this is the right hotel?

949
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:48,663
Don't ask me. I'm blind.

950
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:53,035
Hey, Bubbie,
thanks for a terrific evening.

951
00:55:53,135 --> 00:55:57,272
Thank me in the morning.
The night is not over yet.

952
00:55:57,372 --> 00:55:59,308
What do you mean?
What are you smiling about?

953
00:55:59,408 --> 00:56:02,544
Sleep well, kid. Don't forget
to leave an early wake-up call.

954
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:05,215
What are you talking about?
What's going on here?

955
00:56:05,315 --> 00:56:08,851
I don't trust that guy.

956
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:11,321
Something's going on here.

957
00:56:31,342 --> 00:56:33,877
Hi. I'm Bunny.

958
00:56:36,547 --> 00:56:38,182
Is this 203?

959
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:41,385
♪ Happy birthday
from your brother Harry ♪

960
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:44,555
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

961
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:50,395
This is not my birthday. My
birthday isn't until next month.

962
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:52,297
I'm in no hurry.

963
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,071
Tequila?

964
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:04,576
You never told me what award I
missed when I went to the can.

965
00:57:04,676 --> 00:57:07,612
- The best documentary short subject.
- Oh, damn it.

966
00:57:07,712 --> 00:57:11,517
My favorite category.
What won?

967
00:57:11,617 --> 00:57:14,753
The midgets of Leipzig.
A Czech-Polish production.

968
00:57:14,853 --> 00:57:16,422
Sigmund Wednetski, producer.

969
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:20,559
Directed by Litweil
Zumbredowicz and Stefan Vlech.

970
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:23,262
Mmm.
I thought they would.

971
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:25,298
What was the best picture?

972
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:28,201
The best picture? You were
there when they announced it.

973
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:31,004
It came after the best actress.

974
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,906
I was in a deep depression
at the time.

975
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:34,574
What was the best
bloody picture?

976
00:57:34,674 --> 00:57:36,543
Do you mean what was
the best picture of the year,

977
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:38,778
or what did those idiots pick
as the best picture of the year?

978
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:42,282
What won the award, you asshole?

979
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:44,918
I am not an asshole.
Don't you call me that.

980
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:47,221
Sidney, I have just thrown up

981
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:48,888
on some of the best
people in Hollywood.

982
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:50,857
Now is no time to be sensitive.

983
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:52,526
What was the best picture?

984
00:57:52,626 --> 00:57:54,996
- I'm not telling you.
- I'm not asking you.

985
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,864
I'm threatening you, you crud!

986
00:57:56,964 --> 00:57:59,200
- Now I'm definitely not going to tell you.
- I'm sorry.

987
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,336
I take it back, Sidney.
You're not a crud.

988
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,971
God! Definitely.
Am I still an asshole?

989
00:58:04,072 --> 00:58:06,207
Then I'm never going to tell you.
You behaved abominably tonight.

990
00:58:06,307 --> 00:58:09,644
- Did not. Did not. Asshole crud!
- Abominably. Abominably.

991
00:58:09,744 --> 00:58:13,814
I am going to bed. We have a 10:00 am
plane to catch in the morning.

992
00:58:13,914 --> 00:58:16,418
10:00 am is the morning.

993
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,755
That is redundant,
you a-h.

994
00:58:19,855 --> 00:58:22,591
Oh, do you think I don't know
what you're saying?

995
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:23,925
I can spell, you know.

996
00:58:24,026 --> 00:58:25,994
Not without moving
your lips, you can't.

997
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:28,364
I would like
another drink, please.

998
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:31,167
You drank everything
in this state. Try Nevada.

999
00:58:35,571 --> 00:58:37,174
Oh, Sidney!

1000
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:40,077
I saw your privates.

1001
00:58:40,177 --> 00:58:44,214
You were right.
We should never have come here.

1002
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:46,316
Have you ever seen a greater
assemblage of hypocrites

1003
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:48,118
under one roof in all your life?

1004
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:49,552
Were the hypocrites there?

1005
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:52,189
Why didn't you
point them out to me?

1006
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:54,424
Hypocritical hypocrites.

1007
00:58:54,524 --> 00:58:57,227
They love you and Fawn over you
on the way in.

1008
00:58:57,327 --> 00:58:58,695
And if you're a loser
when you come out,

1009
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:00,231
it's "too bad, darling.

1010
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:03,167
Give us a call
when you're back in town."

1011
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:04,935
You should have thrown up over
the whole bloody lot of them.

1012
00:59:05,035 --> 00:59:08,439
- Sidney?
- Yes?

1013
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:12,276
Was I hit by a bus?

1014
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:18,249
I look as though I was hit by a
fully-loaded, guided tour bus.

1015
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:20,952
Did you notice how quickly
the winners got their cars?

1016
00:59:21,052 --> 00:59:24,389
They must have known beforehand
who the winners were going to be

1017
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:27,792
in order for the winners to get
their cars before everyone else.

1018
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:32,131
We've come 6,000 miles for this bloody
affair, and they park our car in Vancouver.

1019
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:35,100
I've aged, Sidney.

1020
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,370
I'm getting lines in my face.

1021
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,840
I look like a brand-new,
steel-belted radial tire.

1022
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,279
Even Litweil zumbredowicz and Stefan
Vlech got their cars before we did.

1023
00:59:46,379 --> 00:59:47,913
And then, those little twerps,

1024
00:59:48,013 --> 00:59:50,850
they splashed water all over
my trousers as they drove by.

1025
00:59:52,185 --> 00:59:53,819
I'm hungry.

1026
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:58,358
- What are you doing?
- I'm phoning room service.

1027
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:01,761
I want some eggs Benedict.

1028
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:05,399
Hello?
Eggs Benedict, please.

1029
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:09,336
You have to ask
for room service first, twit.

1030
01:00:10,804 --> 01:00:13,274
Room service, please.

1031
01:00:13,374 --> 01:00:16,177
- Twit and a half.
- Oh, touche.

1032
01:00:16,277 --> 01:00:18,111
Isn't there anyone there?

1033
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:21,482
I only wanted
some eggs Benedict.

1034
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:25,752
Oh.

1035
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:28,256
Oh, I see. Mmm.

1036
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:33,561
Well, it just isn't
my night, is it?

1037
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:37,232
Where are you going?

1038
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:40,302
To their bloody kitchen to make
myself some eggs Benedict.

1039
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:44,105
- Twit!
- Twitette!

1040
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:59,121
Lola, I don't feel so good.

1041
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,089
What is it?

1042
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,192
Raw fish and wet feet.

1043
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,696
I'd like to throw up,
but the room is too small.

1044
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:13,537
- Lola, I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Oh.

1045
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:16,973
- I'm positive. I'm gonna... Lola!
- All right.

1046
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,943
Lola, it's coming.
Lola!

1047
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:23,112
Lola. Lola!

1048
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:32,990
- Who could that be at this hour?
- Who do you think?

1049
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:38,028
Their game plan is to see
that we don't get any sleep.

1050
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:41,932
Hello?
It's Lola.

1051
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,168
Yes, Lola.

1052
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:48,273
What? You're kidding.

1053
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:52,877
Well, tell him to take
two combid spansules.

1054
01:01:52,977 --> 01:01:54,746
What?

1055
01:01:54,846 --> 01:01:56,948
Listen, I don't make
house calls when I'm working.

1056
01:01:57,048 --> 01:02:00,386
Why should I on vacation?

1057
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:04,122
All right, all right, all right.
I'll be there. All right.

1058
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:05,857
He's purposely doing this.

1059
01:02:05,957 --> 01:02:09,595
He knows I don't play well
without eight hours sleep.

1060
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:11,397
I'll give him sleeping pills.

1061
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:14,466
He won't be able to raise
his racket for a week.

1062
01:02:14,566 --> 01:02:17,169
Willis, don't start in.
He'll sue you for malpractice.

1063
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,440
But we'll win the match.

1064
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:42,229
I found the people at the Oscars
singularly unattractive this year.

1065
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,466
- Didn't you?
- Oh, Christ.

1066
01:02:45,566 --> 01:02:49,870
I noticed a general decline in
face-lifts and hair transplants.

1067
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,139
Must be the economy,
don't you think?

1068
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,076
Did you get your eggs
Benedictined?

1069
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:58,713
Bitchy. Bitchy, darling.

1070
01:02:58,813 --> 01:03:01,716
You haven't started anything
naughty without me, have you?

1071
01:03:01,816 --> 01:03:04,619
I didn't expect to see you
until dawn.

1072
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,556
I heard lots of other cats
prowling around out there.

1073
01:03:07,656 --> 01:03:09,558
Well, we're not all
as lucky as you, Sidney.

1074
01:03:09,658 --> 01:03:12,293
You got your prowling in early.

1075
01:03:12,394 --> 01:03:15,697
Who was he, Sidney?

1076
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,131
What are you talking about?

1077
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:19,534
That adorable young actor

1078
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:21,571
you were chatting with
all night.

1079
01:03:21,671 --> 01:03:25,107
Gorgeous, wasn't he?
Where did you find him?

1080
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:29,345
He was at our table.
We shared a butter plate.

1081
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:31,747
How spreadably cozy.

1082
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:36,486
Careful, darling.
We're tired, and we're smashed.

1083
01:03:36,586 --> 01:03:38,988
Let's not
get into shallow waters.

1084
01:03:39,088 --> 01:03:41,624
Oh, I am sorry.

1085
01:03:41,724 --> 01:03:44,160
Let's just talk showbiz,
shall we?

1086
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,997
Well, who did you
vote for tonight, Sidney?

1087
01:03:47,097 --> 01:03:48,399
I don't vote, dear.

1088
01:03:48,499 --> 01:03:51,535
I'm not a member
of the motion picture academy.

1089
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:53,904
I'm an antique dealer.

1090
01:03:54,004 --> 01:03:57,073
One day, when you're an antique,
I shall vote for you.

1091
01:03:57,173 --> 01:03:58,642
That's a promise.

1092
01:03:58,742 --> 01:04:02,446
No, I mean who did you
vote for privately...

1093
01:04:02,546 --> 01:04:06,350
In the deep, deep,
inner twit recesses

1094
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:09,687
of your redundant mind?

1095
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:13,825
When miss no-talent ran up
there, all teeth and teary-eyed,

1096
01:04:13,925 --> 01:04:18,262
I could feel the tension release
from every part of your body.

1097
01:04:18,362 --> 01:04:20,765
What a nasty streak you have
when you drink.

1098
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:23,100
Also when you eat
and sit and walk.

1099
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,236
Picky. Picky, Sidney.

1100
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:28,641
Are you unhappy 'cause you
didn't get to wear my dress?

1101
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:31,376
If I had worn your dress,
it would have hung properly.

1102
01:04:31,477 --> 01:04:33,579
Nothing personal.

1103
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:36,381
There never is anything personal
between us, is there,

1104
01:04:36,482 --> 01:04:38,717
or is that getting too personal?

1105
01:04:42,688 --> 01:04:45,190
I was devastated when you lost.

1106
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:48,728
But look at it this way: It's just
a little, bald, naked statue.

1107
01:04:48,828 --> 01:04:50,464
Just like you'll be one day.

1108
01:04:50,564 --> 01:04:53,733
Did he carve his telephone
number in your butter Patty?

1109
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:58,004
- Oh, go to hell!
- What's this, Sidney... A direct assault?

1110
01:04:58,104 --> 01:05:00,807
A frontal attack?
That's not like you, Sidney.

1111
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:04,478
Wit and parry. Wit and parry.
That's more your style.

1112
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:07,213
You make me sick! When you
can't have what you want,

1113
01:05:07,313 --> 01:05:10,050
you make certain everyone
around is equally miserable.

1114
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,886
I hadn't noticed any equals.

1115
01:05:11,986 --> 01:05:15,355
You can throw up verbally as
well as you can nutritionally.

1116
01:05:15,456 --> 01:05:16,991
Adam... that was
his name, wasn't it?

1117
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:18,726
Adam, the first man.

1118
01:05:18,826 --> 01:05:20,961
Not very appropriate
for you, is it?

1119
01:05:21,061 --> 01:05:23,397
Diana, come off it.

1120
01:05:23,498 --> 01:05:25,332
We keep up a front
for everyone else.

1121
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:27,902
Why can't we do it
for ourselves?

1122
01:05:28,002 --> 01:05:30,505
You mean, lie to each other
that we're perfectly well mated?

1123
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:32,741
A closet couple...
Is that what you mean, Sidney?

1124
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:35,511
I have never hidden
behind closed doors,

1125
01:05:35,611 --> 01:05:37,479
but I am discreet.

1126
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:39,815
"Discreet"?

1127
01:05:39,915 --> 01:05:43,018
You did everything
but lick his artichoke.

1128
01:05:43,118 --> 01:05:45,987
Oh, please. Let's not have
a discretion contest.

1129
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:48,957
I have heard about your
lunch breaks on the set.

1130
01:05:49,057 --> 01:05:52,160
The only thing you don't do
in your dressing room is dress.

1131
01:05:54,396 --> 01:05:56,699
Now I've lost count
of my Librium.

1132
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,235
If I'm not up by 9:00,
I've overdosed.

1133
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:01,804
Why is he coming to England?

1134
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:03,039
Who?

1135
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:04,507
That boy.

1136
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:08,511
He said, "see you
in London next week."

1137
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:10,680
What's he doing in London?

1138
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,515
Acting, of course.

1139
01:06:12,615 --> 01:06:14,885
He's making a film there.

1140
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:16,987
What film?

1141
01:06:17,087 --> 01:06:19,056
I don't follow
other people's films.

1142
01:06:19,156 --> 01:06:20,390
I barely follow yours.

1143
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:24,094
Goddamn him!

1144
01:06:24,194 --> 01:06:27,464
And goddamn you,
goddamn the Oscars,

1145
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:30,233
goddamn California,
goddamn everything!

1146
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,602
What is it about this climate

1147
01:06:31,702 --> 01:06:33,203
that brings out
the religion in you?

1148
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:37,108
Why don't you love me?

1149
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,476
What film is that line from?

1150
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,679
You bastard!
Answer the question.

1151
01:06:40,779 --> 01:06:41,780
Why don't you love me?

1152
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,615
It didn't sound like a question.

1153
01:06:43,715 --> 01:06:46,450
I'm tired of paying
for everything

1154
01:06:46,551 --> 01:06:49,087
and getting nothing in return.

1155
01:06:50,054 --> 01:06:51,890
I thought Joe Pickman
paid for everything.

1156
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,727
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't be here tonight

1157
01:06:55,827 --> 01:06:59,431
to have arranged to meet him
in London next week.

1158
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:02,367
Why don't you
love me anymore, Sidney?

1159
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:05,270
I've never stopped
loving you, in my way.

1160
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:10,676
Your way doesn't do me any good.

1161
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:14,346
Diana, it is nearly
4:00 in the morning.

1162
01:07:14,446 --> 01:07:18,684
Now is not a good time to discuss
biological discrepancies.

1163
01:07:19,284 --> 01:07:20,721
Faggot!

1164
01:07:20,821 --> 01:07:24,157
Oh, good. I thought
you'd never ask.

1165
01:07:25,525 --> 01:07:26,893
Don't turn away from me.

1166
01:07:26,993 --> 01:07:28,394
I'm so miserable, Sidney.

1167
01:07:28,494 --> 01:07:30,263
Don't do this to me.

1168
01:07:31,598 --> 01:07:33,734
Please.

1169
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:38,571
I'm sorry. It hasn't been
a winning evening, has it?

1170
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:41,107
Screw the Oscars.

1171
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:43,344
Screw the academy awards.

1172
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:45,412
Screw me, Sidney, please.

1173
01:07:45,512 --> 01:07:46,648
Diana...

1174
01:07:46,748 --> 01:07:48,616
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1175
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:49,984
I don't want to put you
off your game.

1176
01:07:50,084 --> 01:07:53,955
Diana, I am always here for you.

1177
01:07:57,058 --> 01:08:00,127
My friendly filling station.

1178
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:05,267
Why don't you stick
to your own kind, Sidney?

1179
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:10,038
If there's anything I hate,
it's a bisexual homosexual.

1180
01:08:10,138 --> 01:08:12,440
Or is it the other way 'round?

1181
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,976
It works either way.

1182
01:08:14,076 --> 01:08:18,647
Jesus god, Sidney,
I love you so much.

1183
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:23,218
- I know that, darling.
- Why do you stay with me?

1184
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:26,589
What do you get from me that
could possibly satisfy you?

1185
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,826
A wider circle of prospects.

1186
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:33,096
I am a minor celebrity
once removed.

1187
01:08:35,164 --> 01:08:38,968
Sorry I didn't win
that award tonight.

1188
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:41,938
Your dance card would have
been filled for a year.

1189
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:44,941
We haven't done
too badly together.

1190
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:47,712
I'm kinder to you
than your average stuntman.

1191
01:08:47,812 --> 01:08:51,548
There was a time, Sidney,

1192
01:08:51,648 --> 01:08:54,852
when I thought you'd
give it all up for me.

1193
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,526
I love you, my angel,

1194
01:09:02,626 --> 01:09:05,129
more than any woman
I've ever known.

1195
01:09:05,996 --> 01:09:09,334
Christ, I can't get a break.

1196
01:09:10,902 --> 01:09:12,738
I do the best I can.

1197
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:15,106
Thank you.

1198
01:09:15,206 --> 01:09:16,975
You can't say we don't
have fun together.

1199
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:19,745
Oh, hell, no. The dinner
conversations alone

1200
01:09:19,845 --> 01:09:22,013
are worth the trouble.

1201
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,692
Sorry.

1202
01:09:33,793 --> 01:09:35,261
Sorry, Sidney.
It wasn't the kiss.

1203
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:38,264
It's my life.

1204
01:09:38,364 --> 01:09:42,835
Tired? Come on, then.

1205
01:09:42,935 --> 01:09:46,272
Losing Oscars always
does that to me.

1206
01:09:46,372 --> 01:09:51,343
I'll get up first thing
and order your eggs Benedict.

1207
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:54,982
You do take care of me, Sidney.
I'll say that.

1208
01:09:55,082 --> 01:09:58,218
And good help is
so hard to find these days.

1209
01:09:58,318 --> 01:10:02,756
You scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours.

1210
01:10:06,026 --> 01:10:11,765
It's been an evening
of ups and downs, hasn't it?

1211
01:10:12,465 --> 01:10:14,769
Mm-hmm.

1212
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,473
Care to continue the motion?

1213
01:10:27,248 --> 01:10:28,850
Tacky.

1214
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,920
You're getting tacky, my angel.

1215
01:10:33,554 --> 01:10:35,858
I love you, Sidney.

1216
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:49,471
Don't close your eyes, Sidney.

1217
01:10:49,571 --> 01:10:52,107
I always close my eyes.

1218
01:10:52,808 --> 01:10:55,544
Not tonight.

1219
01:10:56,445 --> 01:10:59,482
Look at me tonight.

1220
01:11:01,584 --> 01:11:05,455
Let it be me... tonight.

1221
01:11:15,665 --> 01:11:18,068
- Long!
- What?

1222
01:11:18,168 --> 01:11:20,204
Long. The serve was long.

1223
01:11:20,304 --> 01:11:23,040
You're half asleep. How can
you see the serve was long?

1224
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,409
I saw it with the half
that was awake.

1225
01:11:25,509 --> 01:11:27,378
Second serve.

1226
01:11:27,478 --> 01:11:29,313
I hope he knows something
about orthopedics,

1227
01:11:29,413 --> 01:11:32,416
'cause he won't be able
to walk after this.

1228
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:37,388
Long! Double fault.
Love-fifteen.

1229
01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:39,223
What? What?

1230
01:11:39,323 --> 01:11:41,894
How can you call that ball long?

1231
01:11:41,994 --> 01:11:45,430
It's simple.
Like this: Looooong!

1232
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,032
Now serve the ball.

1233
01:11:47,132 --> 01:11:49,767
Serve the ball, Willis. We only
have the court for an hour.

1234
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:51,403
After I serve you head
for the clubhouse,

1235
01:11:51,503 --> 01:11:53,738
'cause there's
not gonna be any survivors.

1236
01:11:53,838 --> 01:11:58,010
- "Long."
- You ready?

1237
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:07,086
Oh! Ooh!

1238
01:12:07,186 --> 01:12:09,255
Get a towel, somebody, quick!

1239
01:12:09,355 --> 01:12:11,424
- God, Willis! Jesus!
- I'm sorry.

1240
01:12:11,524 --> 01:12:13,492
- If it hurts, massage it.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

1241
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:15,929
- It's ok. It's ok.
- You all right?

1242
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:19,032
- Yeah, I'm ok.
- All right. Go! Second serve!

1243
01:12:19,132 --> 01:12:23,069
Let them have the room tonight,
please. It's safer.

1244
01:12:23,169 --> 01:12:27,407
Never again.

1245
01:12:27,507 --> 01:12:30,410
Never again. Never.

1246
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,612
Never.

1247
01:12:38,452 --> 01:12:40,387
Oh, god.

1248
01:12:41,488 --> 01:12:44,391
What are you doing here?
I thought you left.

1249
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:50,865
Hey, hey. Come on.
You can't stay here.

1250
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:54,169
Wake up.

1251
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,371
Ohhh.

1252
01:12:57,238 --> 01:12:59,374
Oh.

1253
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:07,015
10:45?
Jesus Christ, it's 10:45.

1254
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:10,452
Hey, wake up. Wake up.
Don't you understand?

1255
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,854
It's 10:45.

1256
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,058
Crazy. I must be crazy.

1257
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:23,632
Hello? Hello, operator,
what time is it?

1258
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:28,070
10:45?
Why didn't you call me?

1259
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,673
I left a wake-up call
for 8:00 this morning!

1260
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,043
I did! I didn't?

1261
01:13:33,143 --> 01:13:35,412
Well, you should have
called me anyway.

1262
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:36,946
Hey, come on. Get up.

1263
01:13:37,047 --> 01:13:39,216
My wife could walk in
any minute.

1264
01:13:39,316 --> 01:13:42,485
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

1265
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,687
You deaf or something?

1266
01:13:46,456 --> 01:13:48,591
You all right?

1267
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,396
What'd you do?

1268
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:55,766
You drank an entire bottle of
Tequila with my wife coming in?

1269
01:13:55,866 --> 01:13:58,502
Are you crazy?

1270
01:13:58,602 --> 01:14:00,838
Oh, god.

1271
01:14:00,938 --> 01:14:03,274
Oh, listen, listen.

1272
01:14:03,374 --> 01:14:04,975
You gotta sleep this off
someplace else.

1273
01:14:05,076 --> 01:14:08,012
This is a bad place
to sleep this off.

1274
01:14:09,313 --> 01:14:12,650
Water.
How 'bout some nice water?

1275
01:14:14,653 --> 01:14:17,456
Here, lady.
Sip a little water.

1276
01:14:19,058 --> 01:14:23,095
Drink, sweetheart, for my sake.

1277
01:14:23,995 --> 01:14:26,765
Open your lips, you crazy broad!

1278
01:14:42,615 --> 01:14:45,685
Don't panic. Panic is
the quickest way to divorce.

1279
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:49,222
Don't panic.
Mustn't panic!

1280
01:14:55,795 --> 01:14:59,333
Move. Move!

1281
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:00,801
Please, god, make her move.

1282
01:15:00,901 --> 01:15:05,172
I'll never be a bad person
again, I promise.

1283
01:15:06,973 --> 01:15:10,444
All right. We're going to get
you dressed and down into a cab.

1284
01:15:10,544 --> 01:15:12,746
That's it.

1285
01:15:15,015 --> 01:15:16,817
I'm really sorry this happened.

1286
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:20,288
It was a wonderful evening,
whoever the hell you are.

1287
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:23,625
Come on, darling.
Push.

1288
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:25,393
Get your leg in there.

1289
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:27,995
Get your foot in there and push.

1290
01:15:28,096 --> 01:15:30,865
Come on! Come on.

1291
01:15:30,965 --> 01:15:32,967
Push, darling, push.

1292
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:36,070
Get your feet...
Feet in here.

1293
01:15:36,171 --> 01:15:39,941
Come on!
Damn it, push!

1294
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:42,478
Legs up, and push.

1295
01:15:42,578 --> 01:15:46,048
Get the foot in. Come on.

1296
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:48,451
Come on!

1297
01:15:49,552 --> 01:15:53,822
You're not gonna help me, right?

1298
01:15:53,922 --> 01:15:56,325
Think, think, Marvin.
Think, think.

1299
01:15:56,425 --> 01:15:58,694
Change rooms.

1300
01:15:58,794 --> 01:16:01,664
Let some other idiot
get stuck with her.

1301
01:16:01,764 --> 01:16:04,201
Hello, operator?
Get me the front desk, please.

1302
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:06,336
This is an emergency.

1303
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:09,273
Listen, I have two wonderful
children who need a father.

1304
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:12,176
Don't do this to me.

1305
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,579
Hello, this is Mr. Michaels
in suite 203 and 4.

1306
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,014
Listen, I'm very
uncomfortable in this room.

1307
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:19,749
The bed is very bad for my back.

1308
01:16:19,849 --> 01:16:21,151
When I woke up this morning,

1309
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:23,387
I thought my life was over.

1310
01:16:23,487 --> 01:16:25,990
Well, we don't have
another vacancy

1311
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:28,526
until 2:00
this afternoon.

1312
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:30,661
One moment, Mr. Michaels.
May I help you, ma'am?

1313
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:33,097
Marvin Michaels.
I'm Mrs. Marvin Michaels.

1314
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:35,300
He's on the phone now.
Suite 203.

1315
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,568
Thank you. Would you
tell him I'll be right up?

1316
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:42,006
Mr. Michaels, as I was saying,
we can have a...

1317
01:16:42,106 --> 01:16:44,242
Very nice suite for you
sometime after 2:00.

1318
01:16:44,342 --> 01:16:45,710
I can't wait until 2:00.

1319
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,746
My wife is coming in
from the east any minute now,

1320
01:16:47,846 --> 01:16:51,817
and I know she's not gonna be
happy once she sees this room.

1321
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,853
Who's here? My wife?

1322
01:16:54,953 --> 01:16:57,256
My wife is here?

1323
01:16:57,356 --> 01:16:59,991
You sent my wife up here
without calling me?

1324
01:17:00,091 --> 01:17:03,695
What the hell kind of a cheap
hotel are you running here?

1325
01:17:03,795 --> 01:17:06,232
Well, send somebody to stop her
before she sees this bed!

1326
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:08,835
It could ruin
her entire vacation!

1327
01:17:08,935 --> 01:17:12,205
I could jump. With two broken legs,
she'd never be angry with me.

1328
01:17:12,305 --> 01:17:15,375
Oh, my god.

1329
01:17:16,142 --> 01:17:20,280
- Marvin?
- Oh, god.

1330
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:22,181
Oh, my god.

1331
01:17:22,282 --> 01:17:25,718
Marvin? Hello?

1332
01:17:25,818 --> 01:17:27,920
Marvin?

1333
01:17:29,256 --> 01:17:32,493
Open the door!

1334
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:34,703
Just a minute!

1335
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:37,255
What are you doing,
rearranging the furniture?

1336
01:17:37,331 --> 01:17:38,966
Open the door!

1337
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:41,435
I'm going into the other room.
Once I'm in there,

1338
01:17:41,535 --> 01:17:44,672
lock this door
and don't open it for anyone!

1339
01:17:44,772 --> 01:17:48,376
What?
I cannot hear you.

1340
01:17:49,977 --> 01:17:51,479
Who is it?

1341
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:55,083
- It's me, Millie.
- Millie?

1342
01:17:55,183 --> 01:17:57,919
- Yes!
- Just a minute!

1343
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:03,892
Millie?

1344
01:18:03,992 --> 01:18:06,094
Hello, Marvin.
Thank you for opening the door.

1345
01:18:06,194 --> 01:18:07,629
Hello, sweetie.

1346
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:11,466
Why didn't you pick me up
at the airport?

1347
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:14,670
- Why?
- Yes, why?

1348
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:16,406
Why.

1349
01:18:16,506 --> 01:18:18,574
I've been sick all day.

1350
01:18:18,674 --> 01:18:22,478
I just threw up in the other room.
Don't go in there.

1351
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:26,316
The doctor left
about ten minutes ago.

1352
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:29,319
I have acute gastroenteritis.

1353
01:18:30,786 --> 01:18:33,723
- But it's nothing to worry about.
- Oh, my god!

1354
01:18:33,823 --> 01:18:37,961
- When did this happen?
- About 2:00 in the morning.

1355
01:18:40,196 --> 01:18:41,565
You look terrible.

1356
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:44,335
Why don't you get into bed,
honey. You'll feel better.

1357
01:18:44,435 --> 01:18:46,169
- Come on, you'll be more...
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

1358
01:18:46,269 --> 01:18:49,406
I'm not supposed to lie down.
It makes me nauseous.

1359
01:18:49,506 --> 01:18:52,509
- Honey... ok.
- It just makes me nauseous.

1360
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:55,812
Oh, you're so sweet.

1361
01:18:55,912 --> 01:18:58,049
I feel much better in this room.

1362
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:00,251
It's so much cheerier.

1363
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:03,888
I think you better lie down.

1364
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:10,261
- I need some compazine spansules.
- What's that?

1365
01:19:10,362 --> 01:19:12,229
Aah! It stops nausea.

1366
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:15,733
- Compazine spansules.
- Did you call downstairs to the drugstore?

1367
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:18,235
They don't carry it.
It has codeine in it.

1368
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:21,874
The nearest place that has it is a
drugstore on Santa Monica blvd.

1369
01:19:21,974 --> 01:19:24,743
But they don't deliver. I'm gonna
have to go down there myself.

1370
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,380
All right, I'll go.
I'll go.

1371
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,448
- Where's the prescription?
- What prescription?

1372
01:19:29,548 --> 01:19:31,650
Didn't the doctor give
you a prescription?

1373
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,552
You can't get codeine
without a prescription.

1374
01:19:33,652 --> 01:19:36,121
Yes, you can.
In California, you can.

1375
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:37,523
Compazine spansules.

1376
01:19:37,623 --> 01:19:39,525
Well, then... I have
to go to the bathroom.

1377
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,728
- Now?
- Well, I haven't gone in four hours.

1378
01:19:41,828 --> 01:19:44,731
I told you, I just threw up
in there, all over.

1379
01:19:44,831 --> 01:19:49,335
Please, give me the opportunity
of making it presentable first.

1380
01:19:49,436 --> 01:19:52,672
It means a great deal to me.

1381
01:19:52,772 --> 01:19:54,708
We've been married for 15 years.

1382
01:19:54,808 --> 01:19:57,310
You've never cleaned up
a bathroom before.

1383
01:19:57,411 --> 01:20:00,947
Well, I think it's
high time I started.

1384
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,418
Don't you?

1385
01:20:04,184 --> 01:20:07,755
Please.
I'll be right out.

1386
01:20:10,525 --> 01:20:12,560
- Sit down for a minute.
- No, please, no...

1387
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,729
Here, have a piece of fruit.

1388
01:20:14,829 --> 01:20:17,432
Go to the bathroom
if you're gonna clean up, ok?

1389
01:20:30,011 --> 01:20:32,013
I'm sorry, miss.

1390
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:34,883
I'm gonna have to leave
you out in the hall.

1391
01:20:34,983 --> 01:20:36,552
Don't worry about it.

1392
01:20:36,652 --> 01:20:37,886
They'll take care of you.

1393
01:20:37,986 --> 01:20:40,422
They have very good
service here.

1394
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:54,403
- Mr. Michaels?
- Oh, Christ!

1395
01:20:54,504 --> 01:20:56,338
D-don't ever do that!

1396
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:59,809
I'm sorry. I was just bringing up Mrs.
Michael's bag.

1397
01:20:59,909 --> 01:21:03,345
Oh, good.
They found your bag, honey.

1398
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:04,614
She was very worried about it.

1399
01:21:04,714 --> 01:21:06,048
She was just going down
to look for it.

1400
01:21:06,148 --> 01:21:07,785
You want it in the bedroom?

1401
01:21:07,885 --> 01:21:09,186
No!

1402
01:21:09,286 --> 01:21:11,489
Um, yes.
No, leave it there.

1403
01:21:11,589 --> 01:21:14,124
- In the hall?
- Uh, yes. Uh, no.

1404
01:21:14,224 --> 01:21:18,596
Um, give it to me.
No, uh, put it in the bedroom.

1405
01:21:19,797 --> 01:21:22,500
- Is Mrs. Michaels all right?
- Yes, she's very tired.

1406
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,836
She just flew in from New York.
Thank you very much.

1407
01:21:25,936 --> 01:21:29,440
Uh, I'll take care of you later.

1408
01:21:45,356 --> 01:21:46,991
Marvin, why is the door locked?

1409
01:21:47,091 --> 01:21:51,296
I can't hear you!
I'm in the bathroom, cleaning!

1410
01:21:51,396 --> 01:21:53,332
I can't wait anymore.
Open the door.

1411
01:21:53,432 --> 01:21:55,868
I'll open the door.

1412
01:21:56,802 --> 01:22:00,439
- Here comes the door!
- Marvin!

1413
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,775
The opening of the door
is coming!

1414
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:06,211
- What are you doing?
- I'm on the way to the door.

1415
01:22:06,311 --> 01:22:08,748
The door is open. Don't you
know how to work a door?

1416
01:22:08,848 --> 01:22:11,817
What took you so long? What's the matter?
You got a girl in here?

1417
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:12,818
That's right!

1418
01:22:12,919 --> 01:22:15,689
I have a beautiful blonde
in the bed!

1419
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:18,091
I smell perfume,
women's perfume.

1420
01:22:18,191 --> 01:22:20,827
They spray it in all the rooms.
It's a terrific hotel.

1421
01:22:20,927 --> 01:22:23,063
Oh.

1422
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:30,804
My god, I'm never gonna make it.

1423
01:22:45,386 --> 01:22:47,488
Feel better, sugar pie?

1424
01:22:47,589 --> 01:22:48,690
I've got circles under my eyes.

1425
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:50,658
I didn't sleep all night.

1426
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:51,959
I've gotta take a nap.

1427
01:22:52,059 --> 01:22:54,328
A nap? Why do you want
to take a nap?

1428
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:58,033
You can nap at the bar mitzvah.
You know how boring they are.

1429
01:22:58,133 --> 01:23:01,036
Never gonna get there if I don't
have a few minutes' rest.

1430
01:23:01,136 --> 01:23:02,337
Come on, move over.

1431
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:04,773
Wait... Millie, would
you sit down for a minute?

1432
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:06,742
I have to tell you something.

1433
01:23:06,842 --> 01:23:08,276
Can't I lie down and hear it?

1434
01:23:08,376 --> 01:23:11,947
It's the kind of thing
you should hear sitting up.

1435
01:23:15,651 --> 01:23:18,888
Millie,

1436
01:23:18,988 --> 01:23:23,860
you mean more to me
than you could possibly know.

1437
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,995
But sometimes we transgress.

1438
01:23:26,095 --> 01:23:30,433
Sometimes we do foolish things
which unwittingly

1439
01:23:30,533 --> 01:23:32,235
cause hurt and injury
to the other.

1440
01:23:32,335 --> 01:23:34,938
I don't think you've ever
consciously hurt me.

1441
01:23:35,038 --> 01:23:37,373
Consciously, no.

1442
01:23:37,473 --> 01:23:39,375
But a careless word here,

1443
01:23:39,475 --> 01:23:42,246
a foolish gesture...
There...

1444
01:23:42,346 --> 01:23:43,614
Nothing major, Marvin.

1445
01:23:43,714 --> 01:23:46,651
We've had disagreements,
but nothing major.

1446
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:48,552
I'm glad you
brought that up, Millie.

1447
01:23:48,653 --> 01:23:51,255
What would you consider major?

1448
01:23:51,355 --> 01:23:53,190
Major? I don't know.

1449
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:55,860
I-I can't picture you
doing anything major.

1450
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,195
I-I guess if you were
cruel to the children,

1451
01:23:58,295 --> 01:23:59,296
that would be major.

1452
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:01,398
I would put that number one.

1453
01:24:01,498 --> 01:24:05,236
I would say that that was the worst
thing a man could do in a marriage.

1454
01:24:05,336 --> 01:24:07,572
To be cruel to the children
is unpardonable.

1455
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:09,440
All else could be forgiven.

1456
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,077
If I caught you with another
woman, that would be major.

1457
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:15,013
Let's not get off
the children thing so fast.

1458
01:24:15,113 --> 01:24:18,616
- To me, children are the reflection...
- Marvin, Marvin,

1459
01:24:18,717 --> 01:24:19,851
I've got to lie down.

1460
01:24:19,951 --> 01:24:24,390
Oh, Millie, I've missed you so.

1461
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:26,325
Mm-mm-mm. Oh.

1462
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:29,128
I've missed you.

1463
01:24:30,362 --> 01:24:34,233
So... let's go to the living
room. God, I've missed you.

1464
01:24:37,236 --> 01:24:39,105
Let's make love
in the living room.

1465
01:24:39,205 --> 01:24:41,774
You've missed me?
You've only been away one night.

1466
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:44,944
I know, but there's a
three-hour time difference.

1467
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:50,383
My god, I've never
seen you look so pretty.

1468
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:53,954
Come here,
you cute little thing.

1469
01:24:54,054 --> 01:24:56,056
Don't be ridiculous.
There's not even a bed in here.

1470
01:24:56,156 --> 01:25:00,293
Oh. Oh, well. They...
They have terrific carpeting.

1471
01:25:00,393 --> 01:25:05,098
Come on. We tried pot last year.
Let's try carpeting this year.

1472
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:06,700
Maybe tonight.

1473
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,938
If I don't lie down,
I'll pass out.

1474
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:14,075
Millie! Millie, wait!
Millie, don't! Millie!

1475
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,911
You don't have to get
so upset. I said tonight.

1476
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:20,915
I've never seen you
so sex-crazed in the morning.

1477
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:22,483
I didn't realize
it was the morning.

1478
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:28,723
Why don't you just lie
down next to me and relax?

1479
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:31,827
We don't have to make love.

1480
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:36,732
Just lie down next to me
for... for half an hour.

1481
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,633
Come on. You can
do that, can't you?

1482
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:41,336
Come on.

1483
01:25:54,918 --> 01:25:56,686
What are you doing down there?

1484
01:25:56,787 --> 01:25:59,389
My back is acting up again.

1485
01:25:59,489 --> 01:26:01,724
The bed is too soft.

1486
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:03,960
I don't believe that
for a second.

1487
01:26:05,896 --> 01:26:07,097
Millie,
I can't keep this up anymore.

1488
01:26:07,197 --> 01:26:10,400
I'm gonna get a heart attack.

1489
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,704
I'm gonna tell you something,
Millie, and this is the truth.

1490
01:26:13,805 --> 01:26:16,107
No more lies.

1491
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:20,211
It was never my intention
to hurt you, Millie,

1492
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:23,815
but it's very possible
that in the next few minutes,

1493
01:26:23,915 --> 01:26:26,483
you may be terribly,
terribly hurt.

1494
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:29,720
Uh-huh.
Is it major or minor?

1495
01:26:29,821 --> 01:26:34,125
To me it's minor. To you I think
it's going to be extremely major.

1496
01:26:34,927 --> 01:26:36,929
Well, tell me, Marvin.

1497
01:26:37,029 --> 01:26:40,498
It couldn't be that bad, as long as
you're not trying to cover up something.

1498
01:26:43,936 --> 01:26:45,437
I'd like to show you
something, Millie,

1499
01:26:45,537 --> 01:26:48,473
but I'm gonna ask you
to do something for me first.

1500
01:26:48,573 --> 01:26:50,042
Say nothing for ten seconds.

1501
01:26:50,142 --> 01:26:53,879
Whatever comes to mind, please,
for the sake of both of us,

1502
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:56,850
say nothing for ten seconds.

1503
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:17,336
I'm praying, Marvin.

1504
01:27:17,436 --> 01:27:21,876
I'm praying that the maid
came in to clean

1505
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:26,580
and got dizzy from overwork
and fainted in your bed?

1506
01:27:27,982 --> 01:27:29,884
It's not the maid, Millie.

1507
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:35,055
Well, then, I'm very anxious
to hear who it is, Marvin.

1508
01:27:35,155 --> 01:27:38,058
I can't wait to hear
what you have to say next.

1509
01:27:39,059 --> 01:27:40,695
I'm waiting, Marvin.

1510
01:27:40,795 --> 01:27:42,430
I'm waiting too.

1511
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:45,967
You know what my guess is?

1512
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:48,870
My guess is that that's
a woman in your bed.

1513
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,538
That's my guess too, Millie.

1514
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:52,073
What woman,

1515
01:27:52,173 --> 01:27:55,343
you can tell me in court.

1516
01:27:58,113 --> 01:28:01,116
I'm leaving now, Marvin.

1517
01:28:01,216 --> 01:28:04,987
Before I go, I want to ask
you one silly question.

1518
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:07,123
Why doesn't she move?

1519
01:28:07,223 --> 01:28:09,258
I can explain that.

1520
01:28:09,358 --> 01:28:10,792
Don't tell me you've
been carrying on

1521
01:28:10,893 --> 01:28:12,494
with a helpless paralytic.

1522
01:28:12,594 --> 01:28:15,231
I won't buy it, Marvin.

1523
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:18,935
Millie, she drank a whole bottle
of Tequila by herself!

1524
01:28:19,035 --> 01:28:23,005
Set and match point coming up.

1525
01:28:23,105 --> 01:28:26,343
- Watch it!
- Like I watched the Gauge?

1526
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:35,652
- It's mine!
- Ooh, ooh, ooh. Look out.

1527
01:28:36,486 --> 01:28:38,221
Chauncey, lob it!

1528
01:28:38,321 --> 01:28:40,390
- I got it.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

1529
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:44,661
- I got it, I got it. Willis, I got it.
- Ooh, I got it. Watch it!

1530
01:28:44,761 --> 01:28:46,530
Oh!

1531
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:50,601
Ow!

1532
01:28:53,304 --> 01:28:55,439
Ooh. Ooh! It's broken.

1533
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:58,176
Oh, god. It's broken.
I can feel it.

1534
01:28:58,276 --> 01:28:59,743
It's not broken.
It's sprained.

1535
01:28:59,843 --> 01:29:03,447
You're a nose and throat man.
How do you know?

1536
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,549
We were dead drunk,
the both of us.

1537
01:29:05,649 --> 01:29:07,987
You think I'd do something
like that stone sober?

1538
01:29:08,087 --> 01:29:09,421
Let me tell you something else.

1539
01:29:09,521 --> 01:29:11,590
Being cruel to the children
is number two.

1540
01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:14,994
- That's number one.
- To you, Millie.

1541
01:29:15,094 --> 01:29:18,130
I can understand it being important to you.
To me it was meaningless.

1542
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:21,666
That's a shame, Marvin. I always get so
upset when you don't have a good time.

1543
01:29:21,766 --> 01:29:23,602
Good, good.
Get it out.

1544
01:29:23,702 --> 01:29:25,004
The quicker you get it out,

1545
01:29:25,104 --> 01:29:26,805
the quicker you'll be rid of it.

1546
01:29:26,905 --> 01:29:30,010
God.
And what do I do now?

1547
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:32,145
Do you expect me to go
to your nephew's bar mitzvah

1548
01:29:32,245 --> 01:29:34,514
and say "congratulations"
to the man who paid that woman

1549
01:29:34,614 --> 01:29:35,715
to sleep with my husband?

1550
01:29:35,815 --> 01:29:37,183
He'll probably wink at you.

1551
01:29:37,283 --> 01:29:38,884
He doesn't know that you know.

1552
01:29:38,985 --> 01:29:41,654
I see. Then the joke's on him.
Only you and I know that I know.

1553
01:29:41,754 --> 01:29:44,357
You're right, Millie. You don't
deserve to be treated like that.

1554
01:29:44,457 --> 01:29:46,092
Forget the bar mitzvah.
I'll go back with you

1555
01:29:46,192 --> 01:29:47,627
on the next plane
if that's what you want.

1556
01:29:47,727 --> 01:29:51,798
No. I will not give you or
your family that satisfaction.

1557
01:29:51,898 --> 01:29:55,436
I am going to behave with more
dignity than you ever dreamed.

1558
01:29:55,536 --> 01:29:58,705
I am going to that bar mitzvah
with my head held high.

1559
01:29:58,805 --> 01:30:03,510
I am not going to divorce you.
I am going to forgive you.

1560
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:06,913
I am going to forget
this ever happened.

1561
01:30:07,014 --> 01:30:09,383
I am going to figure out
why it happened,

1562
01:30:09,483 --> 01:30:14,189
and I'm never going to bring
it up again as long as I live.

1563
01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:17,625
And now, I'm going in there,

1564
01:30:17,725 --> 01:30:21,629
and I'm going to spend
every last cent you have.

1565
01:30:24,632 --> 01:30:26,968
Here we go, dear. Here we go.
To the right. To the right.

1566
01:30:27,069 --> 01:30:30,238
- Oh, I feel like a piano... A dead piano.
- All right.

1567
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:33,241
Lola, please get a wet towel
out of our bathroom.

1568
01:30:33,341 --> 01:30:37,613
You mean, this is all your room?

1569
01:30:39,082 --> 01:30:40,683
Huh? I slept standing up,

1570
01:30:40,783 --> 01:30:42,518
and you're living like
the king and queen of England?

1571
01:30:42,618 --> 01:30:44,153
The queen is
about to abdicate her leg

1572
01:30:44,253 --> 01:30:45,554
if we don't get her into bed.

1573
01:30:45,654 --> 01:30:49,492
Lola! Lola, I want you
to see what they got...

1574
01:30:49,592 --> 01:30:51,627
Oh, god.

1575
01:30:51,727 --> 01:30:54,497
- What happened, damn it?
- Oh.

1576
01:30:54,597 --> 01:30:56,766
I broke a bottle of perfume.
I'm sorry, Bett.

1577
01:30:56,866 --> 01:30:59,869
Don't worry.
It was only $90 an ounce.

1578
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:02,038
Of all the stupid-ass
things to do...

1579
01:31:02,139 --> 01:31:03,473
Hold on. She did not
do it on purpose.

1580
01:31:03,573 --> 01:31:04,941
You mean it was
a planned accident?

1581
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,710
We don't have to take this crap.

1582
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:09,179
We can go up to our cigar box
and watch our broken television.

1583
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:13,750
- Come on, honey.
- Ow! Oh, I cut my finger.

1584
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:17,354
It's bleeding.
Oh, damn, that perfume burns!

1585
01:31:17,455 --> 01:31:20,525
Only good perfume. Cheap
perfume you can't feel at all.

1586
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:23,294
Oh, Bett, there's broken glass
on the bathroom floor.

1587
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:24,929
Be careful where you step.

1588
01:31:25,029 --> 01:31:26,231
I'm glad you told me.

1589
01:31:26,331 --> 01:31:28,533
I was gonna walk
in there a lot today.

1590
01:31:28,633 --> 01:31:30,668
Willis, do you have
any band-aids?

1591
01:31:30,768 --> 01:31:34,071
- We'll take care
of one casualty at a time.

1592
01:31:34,172 --> 01:31:36,174
Grab her!

1593
01:31:36,274 --> 01:31:40,179
Oh! Ohh!

1594
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:41,847
- Oh, my leg!
- All right, all right.

1595
01:31:41,947 --> 01:31:47,786
- Will you please help us?
- Now you want my help, huh?

1596
01:31:49,255 --> 01:31:52,591
- Ohh!
- Watch the step.

1597
01:31:52,691 --> 01:31:55,994
Ouch! Oh, help me.
Oh, help me, somebody.

1598
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:58,497
- Lola, what's...
- My head.

1599
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:02,001
I banged my head on the medicine cabinet.
I'm gonna pass out.

1600
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:04,937
No, you're not.
I am. I'm passing out.

1601
01:32:05,037 --> 01:32:06,706
Lola, don't pass...
Lola. Lola.

1602
01:32:06,806 --> 01:32:09,876
My god. Would you get me
a wet towel? She passed out!

1603
01:32:09,976 --> 01:32:13,112
Lola. Lola, sweetheart,
you're gonna be all right, baby.

1604
01:32:13,213 --> 01:32:15,948
Don't lie to the woman.
She knows she's not ok.

1605
01:32:16,048 --> 01:32:18,551
Lola! Lola!

1606
01:32:18,651 --> 01:32:22,189
Lola, you're bleeding on the man's rug.
He'll charge me for it.

1607
01:32:22,289 --> 01:32:25,025
Lola? Lola.

1608
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:28,061
Lola, listen to me.
Lola? Lola?

1609
01:32:28,162 --> 01:32:32,366
How many fingers?
Lola. Lola? Lola? Lola?

1610
01:32:32,466 --> 01:32:35,135
I just stepped on
a broken piece of glass,

1611
01:32:35,236 --> 01:32:37,638
and I hope you're satisfied.

1612
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,942
- That feel better?
- No, that's the wrong ankle.

1613
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:44,278
Would you help me lift her
to the bed, please?

1614
01:32:44,378 --> 01:32:47,760
Only on vacations. This
only happens on vacations.

1615
01:32:47,785 --> 01:32:49,375
Grab her feet. Oop!

1616
01:32:50,452 --> 01:32:52,053
God, it's like
Guadalcanal in here.

1617
01:32:52,153 --> 01:32:53,588
Oh, easy! Easy!

1618
01:32:53,688 --> 01:32:56,825
Easy! Oh, ouch.
Ow! Oh, careful.

1619
01:32:56,925 --> 01:33:00,629
Hey! Ow!
Wait a minute!

1620
01:33:00,729 --> 01:33:03,097
- Ow!
- Ohh!

1621
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:05,467
You're all right.

1622
01:33:05,567 --> 01:33:09,138
This bed is bigger
than our whole room.

1623
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:11,307
- Let's settle up!
- What?

1624
01:33:11,407 --> 01:33:14,677
How much do I owe you, huh?

1625
01:33:14,777 --> 01:33:17,947
Because after I pay you,
I ain't gonna see you.

1626
01:33:18,047 --> 01:33:21,851
All right. All right. Now, let's not
get our noses bent outta shape.

1627
01:33:21,951 --> 01:33:24,220
- It's all over. Let's forget it.
- Forget it?

1628
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,146
Forget it.

1629
01:33:25,171 --> 01:33:27,647
Forget it? Forget the year
I planned for this vacation?

1630
01:33:27,723 --> 01:33:30,894
You know what I got to show for it?
An overdose of Japanese food,

1631
01:33:30,994 --> 01:33:35,632
mildew in my feet from sleeping in a
wet bed, a wife with a concussion,

1632
01:33:35,732 --> 01:33:39,603
two lawsuits for two car crashes
that I didn't drive two times!

1633
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:41,872
And you want me to forget it?

1634
01:33:41,972 --> 01:33:44,441
Ha!
I'm writing a blank check.

1635
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:47,811
- You fill it out and shove it up your...
- No!

1636
01:33:47,911 --> 01:33:49,580
Hey, hey, hey!

1637
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,417
You don't use that language
in front of the ladies.

1638
01:33:52,517 --> 01:33:55,987
The ladies are unconscious.
They can't hear us.

1639
01:33:56,087 --> 01:34:00,725
Now, I owe you for a bottle of
perfume, bloodstains on the rug,

1640
01:34:00,825 --> 01:34:04,262
and an acetylene torch
that burned us out of the car.

1641
01:34:04,362 --> 01:34:07,231
I've had it!
Ah-ah-ah.

1642
01:34:07,332 --> 01:34:09,434
I want to go home.
I need a vacation!

1643
01:34:09,534 --> 01:34:11,737
Now, come on, buddy.
Now, look, let's shake...

1644
01:34:11,837 --> 01:34:14,473
Let's shake, and let's
forget it ever happened.

1645
01:34:14,573 --> 01:34:17,410
Oh, shake hands with the man,
Chauncey, please.

1646
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:20,012
Watch what you're doing, idiot!

1647
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,680
"Idiot"?
That's the hump

1648
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,917
that broke
the camel's back! Aah!

1649
01:34:25,017 --> 01:34:30,188
Either you apologize to my dear,
sweet wife for calling her an idiot,

1650
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:32,458
or I'll take this
Japanese aluminum racket

1651
01:34:32,558 --> 01:34:34,328
and I'll backhand you to death!

1652
01:34:34,428 --> 01:34:37,297
Don't threaten me.
Never threaten a man

1653
01:34:37,397 --> 01:34:39,265
who's spent two years
working the drunk ward.

1654
01:34:39,366 --> 01:34:40,700
Now, back off!

1655
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:44,304
Apologize to my wife
by the time I count to five,

1656
01:34:44,404 --> 01:34:46,373
or I'm gonna start serving
with your big head.

1657
01:34:46,473 --> 01:34:49,042
- One!
- Don't fight. Please don't fight.

1658
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:52,145
- Two.
- Somebody'll get hurt and fall on me.

1659
01:34:52,245 --> 01:34:53,146
Three.

1660
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:55,874
Don't hit him with the racket.
I just had it restrung!

1661
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:59,119
Four! And you know what comes
after four, don't you?

1662
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:02,823
I'll mess you up so bad, even I
won't be able to fix you up.

1663
01:35:02,923 --> 01:35:05,626
Apologize before I get to five!

1664
01:35:08,429 --> 01:35:10,798
Say it.
Go ahead, say it.

1665
01:35:12,667 --> 01:35:16,504
Say it. Are you afraid to say it?
Say "five." Five.

1666
01:35:16,604 --> 01:35:20,208
I'll say it for you. Five!
Five! Five! Say it!

1667
01:35:20,308 --> 01:35:25,347
It don't count unless I say it.
Five!

1668
01:35:40,397 --> 01:35:43,332
Thank god their patients
aren't here to see this.

1669
01:35:52,141 --> 01:35:55,745
- Millie.
- No word from sleeping beauty?

1670
01:35:55,845 --> 01:35:58,481
Oh, thanks.
Thank you very much.

1671
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:00,918
Forget about her. We'll get
dressed, go to the bar mitzvah.

1672
01:36:01,018 --> 01:36:02,920
And tonight,
we'll move to another hotel.

1673
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:04,221
May we do that, Millie?

1674
01:36:04,321 --> 01:36:05,523
I wonder if Harry
spent as much on her

1675
01:36:05,623 --> 01:36:07,791
as we did on his lousy kid.

1676
01:36:07,891 --> 01:36:10,127
Millie, I'll never do
anything again to hurt you

1677
01:36:10,227 --> 01:36:11,795
as long as I live.

1678
01:36:11,895 --> 01:36:14,297
You're the most special woman
in the world to me, Millie,

1679
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:16,166
and I love you.

1680
01:36:16,266 --> 01:36:17,300
I love you, Millie.

1681
01:36:17,401 --> 01:36:19,770
Please, not in front
of the hooker.

1682
01:36:19,870 --> 01:36:22,974
Oh, god, get him off of me!

1683
01:36:23,074 --> 01:36:25,276
Chauncey, don't bite.
You'll ruin your caps!

1684
01:36:25,376 --> 01:36:29,280
Get him off of me! Get him off of me!
I've had enough of you.

1685
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:30,882
Don't you ever bite me again.

1686
01:36:30,982 --> 01:36:32,851
Do you know you could
give me a blood disease?

1687
01:36:32,951 --> 01:36:37,589
Now, tell me we're friends!
Now you say...

1688
01:36:37,689 --> 01:36:40,525
- That you enjoyed the vacation... say it!
- Friends!

1689
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:44,630
You're going to tell
me that you enjoyed...

1690
01:36:44,655 --> 01:36:45,989
Friends!

1691
01:36:46,065 --> 01:36:47,700
- Friends! Now!
- Friends!

1692
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,371
You tell me that you enjoyed
being with us on our vacation!

1693
01:36:52,472 --> 01:36:54,339
Best time I've ever had!

1694
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:58,410
You better believe it.

1695
01:37:02,782 --> 01:37:07,621
- Call your wife off.
- Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off!

1696
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:14,294
Did you love the Japanese
restaurant? Say it!

1697
01:37:14,394 --> 01:37:16,597
Huh? Say it!

1698
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:18,732
- Say it!
- Willis!

1699
01:37:18,832 --> 01:37:22,803
And you say... That you are going...
To love...

1700
01:37:22,903 --> 01:37:25,539
Going with us next year
on a vacation again.

1701
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:26,916
Say it!

1702
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:30,769
You can crack my ribs,
but I won't say it.

1703
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,623
- You like it?
- Mildred, you look beautiful.

1704
01:37:41,723 --> 01:37:45,226
- Yeah? Thank you.
- Beautiful.

1705
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:48,530
Come on, darling. There's
a cab waiting 20 minutes.

1706
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,932
What happened to our roommate?

1707
01:37:50,032 --> 01:37:51,867
She's gone.
She couldn't find her shoes.

1708
01:37:51,967 --> 01:37:56,004
I gave her yours.
Anything to get rid of her.

1709
01:37:56,104 --> 01:37:58,507
Hey, wait. What are you doing?
Hey, you're giving away my cab.

1710
01:37:58,607 --> 01:37:59,929
I asked you to hold that.

1711
01:37:59,954 --> 01:38:02,702
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't
hold it any longer.

1712
01:38:02,778 --> 01:38:04,580
For cryin' out loud. Will you
get me another one, please?

1713
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,715
It'll take about 20 minutes.

1714
01:38:06,815 --> 01:38:09,752
- We're gonna be late. I knew it.
- Hi.

1715
01:38:12,789 --> 01:38:16,125
- Can I give you a lift?
- No, thank you. We'll wait.

1716
01:38:16,225 --> 01:38:19,145
That's very nice of you.
Get in the cab, Marvin.

1717
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:20,420
Are you serious?

1718
01:38:20,496 --> 01:38:24,033
I didn't come 3,000 miles to be late.
Get in the cab, Marvin.

1719
01:38:24,133 --> 01:38:26,903
- Do you know who that is?
- Yes, it's our hooker.

1720
01:38:27,003 --> 01:38:29,438
You think I'd ride
with strangers?

1721
01:38:29,539 --> 01:38:32,576
- This is very nice of you. Thank you.
- Oh, my pleasure.

1722
01:38:32,676 --> 01:38:34,511
- Nice shoes.
- Thank you.

1723
01:38:34,612 --> 01:38:36,614
- Live out here?
- Sometimes.

1724
01:38:36,714 --> 01:38:38,983
Passengers holding
a blue boarding pass

1725
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:44,589
may enter the aircraft
at gate 37-a. Thank you.

1726
01:38:44,689 --> 01:38:47,424
Mother! Whew!

1727
01:38:47,524 --> 01:38:49,059
I was afraid I wouldn't make it.

1728
01:38:49,159 --> 01:38:53,097
What are you doing here?
Where's your father?

1729
01:38:53,197 --> 01:38:55,567
My god. Was it
the Lima beans and broccoli?

1730
01:38:55,667 --> 01:38:59,037
No, no. He's waiting
outside in the car.

1731
01:38:59,137 --> 01:39:03,308
I just wanted to say
good-bye and thank you.

1732
01:39:04,242 --> 01:39:06,277
And I love you.

1733
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:14,419
You don't know what this means to me.
I've been very depressed.

1734
01:39:14,519 --> 01:39:17,189
I just found out
I've already seen the movie.

1735
01:39:20,993 --> 01:39:24,030
I'm gonna miss you, mother,
but I know I'm doing the...

1736
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:26,966
No, no, Jenny. Don't say it.
It's all right.

1737
01:39:27,066 --> 01:39:31,037
I'm doing the right thing.
There. I said it anyways.

1738
01:39:31,137 --> 01:39:33,272
This is for you.

1739
01:39:34,373 --> 01:39:35,541
What is that?

1740
01:39:35,642 --> 01:39:37,944
It's a map
of the movie stars' homes,

1741
01:39:38,044 --> 01:39:40,648
just in case you ever
make it out this way again.

1742
01:39:50,157 --> 01:39:52,525
Sir, I'm sorry about
dropping that suitcase.

1743
01:39:52,626 --> 01:39:55,162
Oh, that's all right. It wasn't
the foot with the glass in it.

1744
01:39:55,262 --> 01:39:58,098
Tell the hostess I have to sit
with my good eye near the window.

1745
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:00,301
I don't want to miss
the Grand Canyon again.

1746
01:40:00,401 --> 01:40:03,672
How can I lecture
and operate on Monday?

1747
01:40:03,772 --> 01:40:08,209
I can't speak,
and I can't look down.

1748
01:40:10,311 --> 01:40:12,246
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1749
01:40:12,346 --> 01:40:14,783
Welcome aboard flight 211
to New York and London.

1750
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:18,419
Our flying time this afternoon will
be four hours and fifty minutes,

1751
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:21,522
and we'll be cruising
at an altitude of 37,000 feet.

1752
01:40:21,622 --> 01:40:25,360
We'll now be serving you cocktails and
beverages and then serving lunch,

1753
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:30,766
followed by our film, no left turn,
starring James Coburn and Diana Barrie.

1754
01:40:30,866 --> 01:40:32,768
Oh, Christ, Sidney,
let's get off.

1755
01:40:32,868 --> 01:40:36,405
Tell them to let us off
this bloody plane.
