1
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,159
For heaνen's sake, Wendy,
look for an airport.

2
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:27,809
- Will you look for the airport?
- Don't make such a fuss.

3
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,880
Just put it down on a mountain.

4
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,682
What do you mean, put it down?
/'m lucky / can keep it up.

5
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,237
- I told you I never flew before.
- Don't shout at me.

6
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:38,844
- I'm a first-class passenger.
- You're a first-class lunatic.

7
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:39,645
It's all oνer.

8
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:42,004
Οur relationship has
a quarter of a tank to go.

9
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,808
Yes, but you love me, don't you, Harold?

10
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,923
I know this is an awkward time
to bring it up...

11
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,079
...but I must know for our future.

12
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,805
Harold, darling, do answer me.

13
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:27,282
You can stop pretending to be asleep,
Sidney, it's over.

14
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:29,599
I was listening to Beethoven's Ninth.

15
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,041
Somewhere on this plane
there's a wonderful orchestra.

16
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:35,965
The cameraman must do
luggage commercials.

17
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,165
All you could see
were the bags under my eyes.

18
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:40,717
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in five minutes.

19
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:43,243
- I suppose we must.
- You were terrific.

20
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,640
- I loved it.
- Thank you, that's sweet.

21
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:47,924
What?

22
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,125
I hope you win the Oscar.

23
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:55,878
It's bizarre.

24
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,442
Eight years with the National Theatre,
two Pinter plays, nine Shakespeare...

25
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:04,158
...three Shaw, and I finally get
nominated for a nauseating comedy.

26
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,439
That's why they call it Hollywood.

27
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,119
Gorgeous colour. The smog.

28
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,480
I wonder if they sell it in bottles.

29
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:20,561
It'd make a wonderful present
for the folks back home.

30
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,724
Thank you.

31
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,437
I'm sorry, Mr. Barrie.
The "No Smoking" sign is on.

32
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,564
Oh, sorry.

33
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:28,442
I thought it was meant
for the people down there.

34
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,360
Christ, the royal treatment.

35
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,158
And if I lose,
we go home in a station wagon.

36
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:41,809
I can get used to this life easily, darling.

37
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,005
Promise me you'll get nominated
every year.

38
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:46,649
We have a magnificent suite
back at the hotel for you.

39
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:47,764
How nice.

40
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,558
- I'll call you in half an hour.
- Fine.

41
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:51,999
Thank you.

42
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,124
Well, that's just fine.

43
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,518
Unless you're making a pot of tea,
we're in trouble.

44
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:18,043
I didn't build the car. I just drove it.

45
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:22,726
Did you look at the gauge like I told you?

46
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:25,198
I looked at the gauge
more than I looked at the road.

47
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,325
I ran off the road, I didn't run off the gauge.

48
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,798
If you looked at the gauge,
it wouldn't have overheated.

49
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:32,483
Looking at the gauge real good
stops it from overheating?

50
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,400
No, but you've got to speak up.

51
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,083
You've got to say,
"The gauge says we're overheating."

52
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,364
This isn't the kind of news
you keep to yourself.

53
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,565
I hate rent-a-cars.
Why don't we leave it here?

54
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,207
It's cooling off. I told you.

55
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,883
All we had to do was give it a chance.
Close the hood.

56
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,038
I'll drive.

57
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,161
No! Oh, God!

58
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:53,279
- Say he didn't slam the hood.
- What's the matter with the doors?

59
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:56,049
Didn't the man say
not to slam the hood down?

60
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,447
Didn't the man say the doors sometimes
lock when you slam the hood down?

61
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:04,438
- Did the man say I would burn my hand?
- It's locked. Who has the keys?

62
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,167
The car has the keys.

63
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,446
- You didn't take the keys?
- I only went from my seat to the hood.

64
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:12,441
I thought it'd be safe.
You're on this side, stand over there.

65
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,044
- What fool closed the windows?
- That fool closed the windows.

66
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,281
Even with my eyes on the gauge,
I saw that fool close the windows.

67
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:22,281
The air conditioning doesn't work
with open windows.

68
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,288
Now the car doesn't work
with closed windows.

69
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,566
- Does it, fool?
- Smile, everybody. We're in Los Angeles.

70
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,167
I'm not paying for this window.

71
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,888
You're keeping the books.
Put the window in his column.

72
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:40,041
We're driving, aren't we?
We're not being towed, are we?

73
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,159
Deduct the cost of being towed
from my column.

74
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,843
When will you two stop bickering
and start vacationing?

75
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:48,397
It's been like this since we left Chicago.

76
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:53,325
I have to go to the bathroom.
Can we pull off and find a gas station?

77
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,637
- Okay, honey.
- "Okay, honey"?

78
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:57,243
What do you mean?
This is no time for "okay, honey."

79
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,762
We're on a freeway.

80
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,966
When your wife wanted tacos,
I heard enough okay-honeys.

81
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,358
Now, how am I on that side, honey?

82
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,199
- You're fine. Hurry up.
- He's not fine if he has to hurry up.

83
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:13,368
Now! Go now!

84
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,562
Whiplash!

85
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,165
Now we all got whiplash. Okay, honey?

86
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,322
Good luck tonight, Miss Barrie.
Would you?

87
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,040
- Everyone says you'll win.
- I'm pleased just to be nominated.

88
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,721
Can I have your picture?

89
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,927
Just by yourself.

90
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,759
Herb, how are you?
Charley, what do you say?

91
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,646
Billy Boy! How's the new script coming?

92
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,085
I found all the words in the dictionary.
Just have to put them together.

93
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,003
We'll never be able to afford this.
The prices out here are ridiculous.

94
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,959
- Yeah, sure.
- Mrs. Hannah Warren, please.

95
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:18,801
- I asked them.
- Bill Warren.

96
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:30,958
Yes?

97
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,637
Where are you?

98
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,600
306. Why don't you come up?

99
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:48,562
- Come in.
- One double scotch, one tea with lemon.

100
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:51,086
- $6.95?
- Yes, ma'am.

101
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,799
Would it be possible
to rent a couple of drinks?

102
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:54,799
Ma'am?

103
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,603
Would you put that
on the coffee table, please?

104
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:03,639
Hello.

105
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,528
Yes, put him on.

106
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,119
Bob?

107
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:10,241
Thank God, a civilised voice. How are you?

108
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:12,684
No, awful.

109
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,918
I can't wait to get out of here.
It's like paradise with a lobotomy.

110
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:18,362
How's Washington?

111
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:21,559
Rain. God, how wonderful.

112
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:26,368
No, nothing is settled yet.
He's on his way up.

113
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,439
Bob, I don't want to call in a lawyer
until I see how it goes.

114
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:34,638
When have you known me
to be intimidated?

115
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:38,282
That doesn't count.

116
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:42,287
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I remember it in detail.

117
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,882
Bob, can you save the erotic conversation
until it can do us both some good.

118
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,528
Yes, I will.
I'll call you as soon as he leaves.

119
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:58,723
I do, too.

120
00:09:59,249 --> 00:09:59,999
'Bye.

121
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,205
It looks like another beautiful day.

122
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:04,838
For a change.

123
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,477
Hello, Hannah.

124
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,319
You were supposed to knock.
I was going to keep you waiting.

125
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,287
You screwed up my big moment.

126
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,439
You still have trouble
saying a simple hello.

127
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,598
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:30,285
You always did get a thrill
out of the little things in life.

129
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,760
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello, Hannah.

130
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:37,244
How are you?

131
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,525
At this moment,
I am completely nonplussed.

132
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:42,806
What have you done to yourself?
You've turned into a young boy again.

133
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,959
- It's good to see you.
- I mean it.

134
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:48,087
You look like
the sweetest, young 14-year-old boy.

135
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,724
You're not spending
your summers at camp, are you?

136
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,481
Just three weeks in July.

137
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,039
Shouldn't we kiss or shake hands?

138
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,399
Let's save it for when you leave.

139
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,246
I made a 1:30 reservation for lunch.
Is that all right?

140
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:05,598
Just give me a minute.

141
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:09,523
When you haven't seen your ex-husband
in nine years your eyes have to...

142
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:10,764
...adjust.

143
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,679
- I love your California clothes.
- They're Bloomingdale's of New York.

144
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:17,283
It's the best place for California clothes.

145
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,605
My God, you look so... I don't know.
What is the word I'm looking for?

146
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,204
Happy.

147
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:26,838
Casual.

148
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,324
You never know out here,
are you dressed up now or is that sporty?

149
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,517
I didn't think a tie was necessary
for a reunion.

150
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,122
Is that what this is?

151
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,920
When you walked in like that,
I thought we were gonna play tennis.

152
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,762
- You certainly look fit enough for it.
- Fit?

153
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,924
You think I look fit?
You awful shit, I look gorgeous.

154
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,806
- Yes, you do, Hannah.
- Your tan, of course, is perfect.

155
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,879
I always wondered
how you got the back of your ears so dark.

156
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:58,565
You put the top of your car down
and drive away from the sun.

157
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,727
Look, if we're going to banter like this,
give me a little time.

158
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:04,084
After nine years, I'm a little rusty.

159
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,718
You'll pick it right up again.
It's like French.

160
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,403
You see, that's what I'd miss
if I ever left New York...

161
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:10,763
...the bantering.

162
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:14,808
San Francisco is only an hour away.
We go up there and banter in emergencies.

163
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,117
I never liked San Francisco.

164
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,963
I was always afraid I'd fall out of bed
and roll down one of those hills.

165
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,165
Not you, Hannah. You roll up hills.

166
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,081
Good, you're bantering.

167
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:31,243
- The flight out wasn't a total loss.
- I detect a bit of snip in the air.

168
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:36,079
Does that mean your conversation
with Jenny wasn't all that successful?

169
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,922
I don't know. I thought
we glared at each other quite well.

170
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,761
I ordered a drink before lunch.

171
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:42,919
I thought one of us might be
a little nervous.

172
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,159
I gave up double scotches six years ago.

173
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:47,285
I'm big on apple juice these days.

174
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,959
I guess I'm the one that's nervous.

175
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:57,843
It's obvious this place agrees with you, Bill.

176
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,761
Or do they call you Billy?

177
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,403
That's right. Jenny told me.

178
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:05,287
- Everybody calls you Billy.
- That's me, "Billy."

179
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,607
It's just adorable.

180
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,322
44-year-old Billy...

181
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:12,606
...standing there
in his cute little sneakers and sweater.

182
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:17,484
You'd better sit down.
You make me feel like your math teacher.

183
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,882
I promised myself driving over here
I would be pleasant.

184
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,563
- I am being pleasant.
- You drive everywhere, do you?

185
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:27,560
- Everywhere.
- Even to your car?

186
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,718
If we're going,
I think we'd better get started.

187
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,764
You have changed.

188
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,761
You know, you don't get rattled
as easily as you used to.

189
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:37,079
They don't have as many rattlers out here.

190
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,763
Maybe this lunch
won't be as dull as I thought.

191
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,319
Hey, Marvin!

192
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:58,600
- Harry!
- Hey, boy!

193
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:09,243
You got so bald. How did you get so bald?

194
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,241
You don't see your brother in five years,
that's all you say?

195
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,082
I didn't even know it was you,
you got so bald.

196
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,599
- Where's Millie?
- She's coming in on the morning plane.

197
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:22,321
You know, we don't like to fly together
on account of the kids.

198
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,922
You got so bald.

199
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,359
Marvin, take a gander.

200
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:32,526
I'd give up two years of my life
for one hour with each of them.

201
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:35,043
You still haven't changed, have you?

202
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:38,199
Let's say hello and see how far we can get.

203
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:40,359
Don't start in with me, Harry.

204
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,362
I'm here one night without Millie.
Don't get me into trouble.

205
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,404
Would I do that to you?

206
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:47,879
You did it to Papa when he was
82 years old, don't do it to me.

207
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,201
- Oh, Miss...
- Stop, already, with the girls!

208
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,718
Your kid is getting
bar mitzvahed tomorrow.

209
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:58,006
Stop it! What is this, a jogging outfit?

210
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:58,999
That's what we do here.

211
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,686
Jenny tells me you've moved.
You're not in Hardy Canyon anymore.

212
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,487
Laurel. Laurel Canyon.

213
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,646
Laurel, Hardy, what the hell.

214
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:11,847
She says it's sort of a small French
farmhouse with a little water mill in back.

215
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,523
- And the sweetest little tennis court.
- That's right.

216
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:15,883
Sounds awfully rugged.

217
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,563
We're from pioneer stock
out here in the West.

218
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,924
There's a glass house
two blocks down the road...

219
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,079
...if you want to throw some more stones.

220
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,764
Maybe I'll just drop something
from the plane when I leave tonight...

221
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:28,043
...with Jenny.

222
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,040
- This is very familiar.
- Yeah.

223
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:36,518
The house we rented
the year before Jenny was born...

224
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,520
...is just down the road there.

225
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,725
That wasn't a bad summer, was it?

226
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:45,761
I thought it was terrific.

227
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:50,404
Well, the Pacific Ocean was
a lot more interesting in those days.

228
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,764
- No, thank you.
- No cigarettes either?

229
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:58,840
No, / gaνe them up eight years ago.

230
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:02,046
Don't you miss the coughing
and the hacking in the morning?

231
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,518
/t woke the dogs up. / haνe dogs now.

232
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,806
Isn't divorce wonderful?

233
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,722
You have changed, Billy.
You've gone clean on me.

234
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:17,084
Tell me, what else do you do
to keep that winsome adolescent look?

235
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,963
You're dying to make a little fun of me,
aren't you?

236
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:23,040
No, I don't mind. I have an hour to kill.

237
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:26,007
Would you believe
I run five miles every morning?

238
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,678
- After what?
- After a good night's sleep.

239
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,159
I don't even have a pill
in my medicine cabinet.

240
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:33,717
- And I gave up analysis.
- I heard that.

241
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,765
- Why did you quit?
- I went sane.

242
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:37,925
Sane? My God, how boring.

243
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:41,808
Tell me something,
don't you ever get depressed?

244
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,681
- Yes.
- When?

245
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,404
Now.

246
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:52,961
- I hear you went in for an operation.
- A hysterectomy.

247
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,838
It was nothing. I have them every year.

248
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:59,684
I understood you had prostate trouble.

249
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:01,840
Small world, isn't it?

250
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,807
Our past sins do have a way
of catching up with us.

251
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:07,798
Jenny tells me you have a new boyfriend.

252
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:09,798
No.

253
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,367
I have a lover. Jenny has boyfriends.

254
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:16,878
A writer for the Washington Post, I'm told.

255
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,961
He's 54 years old,
he has a heart condition, asthma...

256
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,246
...leans toward alcoholism.

257
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,241
He also has the second-best mind I've met
in this country since Adlai Stevenson.

258
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:30,520
What's with you, mate-wise?

259
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,483
Mate-wise?

260
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,526
- Mate-wise, I'm seeing a very nice girl.
- Are you?

261
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:42,762
- Where are you seeing her to?
- Come on, Hannah.

262
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:48,484
I beg your pardon if I offended you.

263
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:53,197
My God, it's a long time since I've been
involved in a smart-ass conversation.

264
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,598
I'm sorry, but you're the one
that said things like:

265
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:58,487
"I hear you have a boyfriend"
and "I'm seeing a nice girl."

266
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,685
I'm not the one
with the Bobbsey Twin haircut...

267
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,202
...and the Peter Pan phraseology.

268
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,928
I can see you've really come to hunt bear,
haven't you?

269
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:08,046
Hunt bear?
Is that what you said? Hunt bear?

270
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:11,641
Is that the kind of conversation
you have around the campfires...

271
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:13,640
...out here in the rugged West?

272
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,407
Can we talk about Jenny?

273
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:20,597
What's your rush? She's only 17.
She has her whole life ahead of her.

274
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,042
If I'm gonna turn my daughter over to you,
which I am not...

275
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:27,360
...at least I want to know what you're like.
- Jenny is our daughter.

276
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:28,518
Ours.

277
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,842
Maybe. They've been a little slow
with the blood test.

278
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:37,078
Christ! Five million cigarettes
are murder on the lungs.

279
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:42,480
You used to be the healthiest girl I knew.
What happened?

280
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:46,323
With Nixon in the White House,
good health seemed to be in bad taste.

281
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,729
Your friend's about a size too small for me.

282
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:55,642
How does she fit you?

283
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,237
Nicely, thank you.

284
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:02,527
Is this the neophyte actress with the
golden hair Jenny's been telling me about?

285
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,328
- Am I being too nosy?
- Not for a Newsweek editor.

286
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,849
Yes, she is,
and she's a damned good actress.

287
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,888
- Married before, has a 9-year-old boy.
- Really?

288
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:14,759
Should make a nice pet for Jenny.

289
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,767
Is marriage contemplated?

290
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:22,206
It's contemplated, it's being discussed
and seriously considered.

291
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:24,678
- And we all get along like clams.
- Right.

292
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:28,600
Will there be room for all of you
in the little French farmhouse?

293
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:32,159
Or will you have to take a Moroccan villa
on Wilshire Boulevard?

294
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,399
What the hell are you so bitter about?

295
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,479
You used to be bright and witty.
Now you're just snide and sarcastic.

296
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:40,797
It comes with age.

297
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,768
When you don't have a fastball anymore,
you go to changeups and sliders.

298
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,239
Can we go? I feel like we're playing
From Here to Eternity.

299
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,687
- Pretty girl.
- I think so.

300
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:10,202
I suppose if Jenny stays,
she'll grow up to look like that.

301
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,200
Blonde hair, blonde teeth...

302
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:13,882
...blonde life.

303
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:17,564
God, I can just hear the quips flying
when you and the second-best mind...

304
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,879
...since Adlai Stevenson get together.

305
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:24,248
Sitting there freezing under a blanket
at the Washington Redskins games...

306
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,685
...playing anagrams with
the names of all the Polish players.

307
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,519
Your mind clicks off bric-a-brac
so goddamn fast, it never has a chance...

308
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,248
...for an honest emotion
or thought ever to get through.

309
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:38,641
You're so full of honest emotion, you fall
in love every time someone sings a ballad.

310
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:42,279
You're worse than a hopeless romantic,
you're a hopeful one.

311
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:46,201
You're the kind of man
who would end the world famine problem...

312
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,123
...by having them all eat out,
preferably at a good Chinese restaurant.

313
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,439
For God's sake, let's stop this crap.

314
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:59,163
I don't know if you're bitter
because Jenny ran away...

315
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:02,400
...or because she ran to somebody
whose lifestyle epitomises...

316
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:04,639
...all you consider cheap and banal.

317
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,643
I don't have a lifestyle. I have a life.

318
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,957
You have no legal rights to her.
You understand that?

319
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,165
- Certainly.
- Then tell her to come home with me.

320
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:19,161
I did. She would like to try it
with me for a year.

321
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:22,807
- She's not happy in New York.
- Nobody's happy in New York...

322
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,288
...but they're alive!

323
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:26,362
What a snob you are.

324
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:30,119
Thank God there's a few of us left.

325
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,240
What is so beautiful about your life...

326
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,048
...that makes it so important
to put down everyone else's?

327
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,007
New York is not the centre
of the goddamn universe.

328
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:44,125
I grant you, it's an exciting,
vibrant, stimulating, fabulous city...

329
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:45,847
...but it is not Mecca.

330
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:47,757
It just smells like it.

331
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,885
To hell with New York,
or Boston or Washington.

332
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:52,483
I don't care where Jenny lives, I care how.

333
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:57,084
She's a bright girl with an intelligent mind.
Let it grow and prosper.

334
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,080
What's she going to learn in a community...

335
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:02,559
...whose greatest literary achievement
is the map to movie stars' homes?

336
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:04,321
Tell me about it, Hannah.

337
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:08,765
Tell me about the political elite
on Martha's Vineyard in July.

338
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,798
I remember vividly...

339
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:14,848
...those charity luncheons to raise money
for the California grape pickers.

340
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:18,558
A teeming mob of women who
must have spent $12,000 on Gucci pants...

341
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,881
...so they could raise $2,000
for the grape pickers.

342
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,087
Why the hell didn't they just
mail them the pants?

343
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:30,447
You were terrific
when you used to write like that.

344
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,128
I haven't seen your newest film.

345
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:34,928
I'm told it grossed very well
in backward areas.

346
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:40,162
- Jesus, was I anything like you before?
- I couldn't hold a candle to you.

347
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,322
No wonder nobody here talked to me
for the first two years.

348
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:44,524
Lucky you.

349
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:47,719
Look, we have to settle this today.

350
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:52,124
If you respect Jenny as a person,
respect her right to make a free choice.

351
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,279
You get her for the summers,
that's enough.

352
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:57,725
It takes me the other ten months
to get the seaweed out of her brains.

353
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,925
How much time do you spend with her?

354
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:03,283
How often do you have breakfast with her?

355
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:06,928
How many nights a week
does she eat dinner alone?

356
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,008
You think she's happy
with that $20 bill you give her...

357
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,126
...every time you go off to Washington
for the weekend?

358
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,004
The girl is growing up lonely, Hannah.

359
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:23,040
She's flown out here
on her own savings to prove it to you.

360
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,520
She has two dogs, a Dominican cook...

361
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:29,568
...and every good-looking boy in
the senior class living off our refrigerator.

362
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:33,324
Despite her Gothic reports,
she is not living the life of Jane Eyre.

363
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:37,088
Would you like to know
what Jenny has to say about you?

364
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:39,399
She told me.
She thinks I'm a son-of-a-bitch.

365
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:42,049
She also thinks I'm a funny son-of-a-bitch.

366
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:45,322
She loves me, but she doesn't like me.
She's afraid of me.

367
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,047
She's intimidated by me.

368
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,241
She respects me,
but she doesn't want to become like me.

369
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:53,447
We have a perfectly normal
mother-daughter relationship.

370
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,167
How can you be so flippant...

371
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,444
...when it comes to
your daughter's well-being?

372
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,919
How can you be so pompous
not to recognise a perfectly normal...

373
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,318
...rebellious attitude in a young girl?

374
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:06,759
If she didn't complain,
I'd send her to an expensive shrink.

375
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,445
Since she's with me
ten months of the year...

376
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,521
...it is only normal
you're the one she's going to miss.

377
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:16,442
I think, by and large,
she and I have managed quite well.

378
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,407
But like all young girls,
she needs a father image.

379
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:20,685
I don't mind.

380
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:23,761
If it's only July and August,
it might as well be you.

381
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,688
This is April and she came out
without your permission.

382
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,680
She never had a good head for dates.

383
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:31,283
What would you do
if I just keep her here with me?

384
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,724
I'll call my friend,
the US Attorney General...

385
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,277
...if she's not on the 9:00 plane tonight.

386
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,045
Why didn't you ever run for office?

387
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,121
I always thought you'd have made
a hell of a governor.

388
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,283
I don't think a democratic system
really works.

389
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:47,519
Offer me a monarchy and we'll talk.

390
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:51,719
It's 2:30. Will you call Jenny or shall I?

391
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:52,844
No.

392
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,238
No, what?

393
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:56,124
No, sir.

394
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:09,167
The truth, Hannah.
You know if we leave it up to Jenny...

395
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:11,888
...you don't stand a chance
of getting her on that plane.

396
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,529
Certainly.
Why else would the ninny run away?

397
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,128
Who said we don't have problems?

398
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:20,248
She is 17. When we go at each other,
she needs another shoulder to cry on.

399
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:23,449
But I'll be goddamned
if I'm gonna give up a daughter...

400
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:26,282
...for a pink cashmere shoulder
3,000 miles away.

401
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:29,562
This is an event.

402
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:33,765
It's the first time in my life
I've ever seen you so nervous.

403
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,684
I'm not nervous. I'm scared to death.

404
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:40,360
That's good of you to admit it.

405
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:44,449
But honesty always was
one of your strengths.

406
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,478
You're pretty cute yourself. I mean it.

407
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:54,082
Why do men have to get better-looking
when they get older?

408
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,683
Remind me to bring it up
at the Equal Rights Commission.

409
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:59,244
Where are the stars?
I don't see any stars yet.

410
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:00,967
They come out at night.

411
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:04,878
I'll pick you up for dinner,
6:30 in front of the hotel.

412
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,245
Suit and tie or sloppy like you?

413
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:11,719
Look at that beauty.
They fall out of the trees like oranges.

414
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,960
Lucky I didn't move out here.
I'd be bald, like you.

415
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:19,087
How come you're so preoccupied
with sex, sex, sex?

416
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:21,484
I thought all that jogging,
you'd forget about sex.

417
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:23,127
You know something better?

418
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:26,360
- Here you go. Thanks.
- You're still the same: Girls, girls, girls.

419
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:28,007
You fall apart every time you see a tookus.

420
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:35,839
Hello.

421
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,048
Yes, how are you?

422
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,560
She's a bit nervous, I think.

423
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,122
Do you really think she will? Let's hope so.

424
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,567
Yes, and thank you for the flowers
and for the fruit.

425
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,402
And for the lovely suite.

426
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:55,959
And for the caviar, and for everything else
you send up by the hour.

427
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:59,368
One moment, Joe. Diana, it's Joe Pickman.

428
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:01,607
Tell him I'm in the can.

429
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,444
The man has paid for this trip
and this suite.

430
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,838
He gave you the best part
you've had in five years.

431
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,523
I am not going to tell him you're in the can.

432
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,248
Then I'll tell him.

433
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:18,126
Joe, darling.

434
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,403
I told Sidney to tell you I was in the can.

435
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:25,717
I didn't want to speak to you, that's why.

436
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,844
Because I feel so responsible.
I don't want to let you down tonight.

437
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,284
I know how much this film means to you...

438
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:36,327
...and I want so much
to win this award for you, Joe.

439
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,439
No, there was no picture without you.

440
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:42,728
Goddamn it, it's true.

441
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:47,405
After four studios turned it down, you
deserve some special perseverance award.

442
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:50,927
You're a chubby little man and I adore you.

443
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:57,128
If I win tonight, darling,
it's not going to be an Oscar.

444
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:02,118
It's going to be a Joe Pickman.

445
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:07,048
You're an angel.

446
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:12,639
- That was very sweet.
- Did you like it, dear?

447
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:16,278
- That's going to be my acceptance speech.
- Your acceptance speech?

448
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,837
All except the part that I was in the can.

449
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:23,402
Naturally, you and I know
I don't have a hope in hell...

450
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:25,719
...but you have to prepare something.

451
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:29,246
You can't just stand there
sobbing all over Burt Reynolds.

452
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:32,283
You've got as much chance as anyone else.

453
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:36,883
No, I don't have the sentiment on my side.

454
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:42,442
You've got to have a sentimental reason
for them to vote for you.

455
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:47,641
Any decent actress
can give a good performance, but...

456
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,600
...the dying husband,
that would have insured everything.

457
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,244
You wouldn't like to get something
fatal for me, would you, angel?

458
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:00,242
You should have told me sooner.
I could have come over on the Hindenburg.

459
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:03,961
We are dreadful, aren't we, Sidney?

460
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,207
- God will punish us.
- I think he already has.

461
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:15,322
Let's do something naughty.

462
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,684
You always think
of such good naughty things to do.

463
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,602
- I was naughty all day yesterday.
- Not with me, you weren't.

464
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:23,249
You'll just have to learn
to show up on time.

465
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:39,561
Except for an extremely critical decision
still to be made, it's been a nice day.

466
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:44,407
What do you say, Hannah?

467
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:50,322
I'm out of cigarettes.

468
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:57,122
I can't be expected to give up my daughter
and cigarettes on the same day.

469
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,283
Goddamn it.

470
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:16,279
I only have one more year with her.

471
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,084
Next September, she's going to college.

472
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:24,405
She's going to come out in four years
a revolutionary or a nun.

473
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,998
Or worse, like you or me.

474
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,998
A little bit of both wouldn't be so bad.

475
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:34,761
Do you like your mother?

476
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:37,481
My mother? She's dead.

477
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:40,727
Don't quibble. Did you like her?

478
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:44,488
Yes, I liked her.

479
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:48,007
I don't like mine much.

480
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:51,647
Can you imagine being
a pain in the ass for 78 years?

481
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,963
I knew there was something wrong.
Even in the womb...

482
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:56,880
...I never felt comfortable.

483
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:59,360
I think I was hanging too low.

484
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,566
We shouldn't have had Jenny.

485
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:10,557
People like you and me, we're too selfish.

486
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,807
And I don't want her...

487
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,847
...to grow up hating me.

488
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:20,397
I don't want to see her
growing up out here...

489
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:23,049
...because I'm scared I'm going to hate her.

490
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:29,199
I know.

491
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,644
Maybe you and I
should have stayed together.

492
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:34,562
We could have let Jenny go.
What do you think?

493
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:38,883
I think you're still one of the most
interesting women I've ever met.

494
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,407
- He's not going to live long, you know.
- Who isn't?

495
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:48,679
My friend at the Washington Post.

496
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:52,680
He had open-heart surgery
that was a total waste of time.

497
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:00,439
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- So am I.

498
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:03,879
The man could really make me laugh.

499
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:10,920
- You win some, lose some.
- Talk about resiliency.

500
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:17,801
For a smart lady in a man's world,
I'm not doing so bad.

501
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:28,643
Tell me something.
Is being in love better now?

502
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:31,884
Yes.

503
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,244
Why?

504
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:38,008
Because it's now.

505
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:41,288
Oh, Christ.

506
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:47,364
I can't wait to become a grandmother.

507
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,079
I screwed up the first time around.

508
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:58,325
Yes.

509
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,358
I see.

510
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,008
Yeah, I understand.

511
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:14,560
No, I'll take care of it. Okay. Bye-bye.

512
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,327
It's Jenny.
She's downstairs with her bags packed.

513
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:21,967
She says it's up to us.

514
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,768
She'll abide by whatever decision
we both make.

515
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,927
- And you agreed?
- Certainly.

516
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,765
What a cunning bastard you are.

517
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:33,648
If she goes back to New York,
she'll think I coerced you.

518
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:36,368
If she stays here,
she'll think I didn't fight for her.

519
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:39,839
- You think she has that devious a mind?
- Of course, she's my daughter.

520
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:43,239
Don't suppose you'd consider spending
ten months of the year back East?

521
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,240
Only if everyone there leaves.

522
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:50,323
You want me to make it easy for you?

523
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:52,167
I'll throw in my vote.

524
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,879
Whatever you say goes.
I'll tell Jenny we both made the decision.

525
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,759
Jesus, no wonder there are so many
used-car salesmen out here.

526
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:07,880
How much time do I have?
I've always panicked at deadlines.

527
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:10,201
As much time as you want.

528
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:40,923
Is it only from here
she looks so small to me?

529
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,722
I say she goes back.

530
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:49,278
I see.

531
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:52,485
All right, then, she goes back.

532
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:56,088
You think I'm wrong, don't you?

533
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:58,205
I'm disappointed, but I trust your instincts.

534
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:01,599
If you feel it's right,
I have faith in Jenny that she'll see it, too.

535
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:02,758
I'm...

536
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:10,197
I'm so afraid I'm going to lose her, Bill.

537
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:22,439
- What are you looking at?
- This is a new colour for you:

538
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:24,243
Vulnerable.

539
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:27,680
Take a picture of it
because you're not gonna see it again.

540
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:32,679
- Keep her.
- What?

541
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,722
I said, keep her.

542
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,325
But for six months, not a year.

543
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,322
I get to choose the school...

544
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:45,640
...and any school I choose
has to give me three references.

545
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:47,328
God, what am I doing?

546
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:50,883
Stay the weekend.
Talk it over again with Jenny.

547
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:53,961
You don't have to make a decision
because you got a plane ticket.

548
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:55,164
I'm a fighter.

549
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:57,558
If I stay the weekend,
I'll not only take Jenny...

550
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,924
...I might take
your damn girlfriend back, too.

551
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:04,127
Don't let me bully you into this, Hannah.
Why can't the three of us talk it out?

552
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:06,439
- I'm gonna get Jenny up here.
- No, goddamn it!

553
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:09,760
If I have to give her up to get her back,
then let's do it.

554
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,287
You never stop amazing me.

555
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:16,607
I'll tell you one thing.

556
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:19,118
You're not the same woman
I left nine years ago.

557
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,598
And I'm missing the ovaries to prove it.

558
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:28,239
Well, guess who's nonplussed now.

559
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:32,244
You never thought I'd say yes, did you?

560
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,760
Keep up that pioneer spirit.

561
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,844
You'll need it
raising a 17-year-old daughter.

562
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,965
I think you're doing a terrific thing.

563
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:41,198
So do I.

564
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:44,445
I suppose you want to see her
before you go.

565
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:46,485
You suppose wrong. I've seen her.

566
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:49,800
I'll call her when I get to New York.
Bell Captain, please.

567
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:53,482
What should I tell her?

568
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:57,403
Tell her I hope she'll be happy,
and I'm selling her record collection.

569
00:36:57,689 --> 00:37:00,647
Would you send someone up
for the luggage? Room 306.

570
00:37:00,729 --> 00:37:01,798
Thank you.

571
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,718
You know, we couldn't have been
too bad together.

572
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,085
- We produced a hell of a girl.
- You have that a little wrong.

573
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:12,047
I think the two of you produced
a hell of a mother.

574
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:14,602
Maybe you're right.

575
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:19,637
Can we shake hands now?
I'm about to leave.

576
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,160
Sure. What more can I lose?

577
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:53,124
Serve her plenty of broccoli
and lima beans.

578
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:55,165
- She likes them?
- She hates them.

579
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:57,720
But from now on, what do I care?

580
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:03,046
Good-bye, Hannah.
It was very good seeing you again.

581
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:07,725
I feel like an artist about to part with
a painting that she doesn't want to sell.

582
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:12,407
- I'll frame it and keep it in a good light.
- Do that.

583
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:16,206
Take care of my daughter, too.

584
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:00,644
'Bye.

585
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:12,438
What do you mean, one room?
There are two reservations.

586
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:16,238
Dr. And Mrs. Willis Panama.
Dr. And Mrs. Chauncey Gump.

587
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:17,728
I have here one deluxe room...

588
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:20,881
...double bed, for Dr. And Mrs. Panama
on the 3rd, 4th and 5th.

589
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:22,482
I have nothing for a Dr. Gump.

590
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,402
There must be a clerical error,
or omission of intelligence...

591
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,764
...because my travel agent
made the reservation.

592
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,522
He's my wife's brother,
and he's also my patient.

593
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,885
- I wish you'd double-check it.
- I've already double-checked our files.

594
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:36,563
Here's the telegram we received.
See for yourself.

595
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:39,163
Yes, I can see that my name
is missing from this wire...

596
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:41,604
...but as you see,
I'm not missing from your hotel.

597
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:43,600
There's four of us, and we need two rooms.

598
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:47,125
I don't have two rooms available.
I'm sorry. It's Academy Award week.

599
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:50,087
We don't care who wins.
We just want to get into bed.

600
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:54,128
I do have a small single.
However, there are some repairs going on.

601
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:57,406
It's not terribly comfortable,
but I can squeeze a small daybed in.

602
00:39:57,489 --> 00:39:59,798
I'm sorry, but it's the best I can do.

603
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:01,718
What do we do?

604
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:04,369
I'm not gonna stand around
with whiplash and argue.

605
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:07,122
I'm gonna check into the Hilton.
Let's go, baby.

606
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:10,686
It's our last few days of vacation.
I hate for us not to be together.

607
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:13,602
"Not be together"?
We're going to the Hilton, right?

608
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:16,123
They do have a reservation for two of us.

609
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,558
You want to stay
after the way they've treated us?

610
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,528
- They're treating me and Bettina all right.
- I had my heart set on staying here.

611
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:25,806
- I mean, it's so pretty here, Chauncey.
- Listen.

612
00:40:26,409 --> 00:40:29,287
Even a tiny room in this place
couldn't be too bad.

613
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:32,687
- It's only for two nights.
- Please, Chauncey.

614
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:36,084
Okay.

615
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:37,968
Okay.

616
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:42,325
- We'll toss for the small room.
- I already have my reservation.

617
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,721
You're not thinking
what I hope you're not thinking.

618
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,401
I didn't make the reservation.

619
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,481
I don't see why we have to suffer
because her brother is an idiot.

620
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:55,164
We see enough blood in the hospital.
I don't want to see blood in the lobby.

621
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:57,717
Either we toss for the room,
or we toss for the room.

622
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:00,084
- Now call it.
- I'm not tossing for any room.

623
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:03,127
I'm going up to my registered room,
sit in my reserved bath.

624
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:04,437
Come on, honey.

625
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,923
Take it easy.

626
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:09,799
- What time is it?
- What?

627
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,322
What time is it?

628
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:13,238
It's 12:45.

629
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,401
Remember that time,
because that's when we declared war.

630
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,159
Yes, we'd like the court
from 10:00 a.m. To 11:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

631
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:22,399
And split the charges
with me and Dr. Gump.

632
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:25,162
With balls and everything.
All right, thank you.

633
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,161
We got it. We are set.

634
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:29,883
Tomorrow morning.

635
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:34,485
We're going to cream them
six-love, six-love, and if we have time...

636
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:35,843
...six-love again.

637
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:49,927
- Hello.
- Chaunce. Hi, buddy, what are you doing?

638
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:53,439
Nothing much.
Just sitting here watching the toilet flush.

639
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:56,964
It's been flushing two hours now,
wouldn't you say?

640
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:59,722
That's too bad.
You and Lola want to use our john?

641
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,279
No. We were thinking about
waiting till we get back to Chicago.

642
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:07,238
We're all set. Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.
How's that?

643
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,525
Fine.

644
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:12,283
Sneakers will be damp though,
but you won't mind.

645
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,325
When are we going
to the Greek restaurant?

646
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:17,481
Lola wants to know what time
we're going to the Greek restaurant.

647
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:18,718
Didn't I tell you?

648
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:22,040
Bettina felt like Japanese,
so I booked Fujiyama's for 7:30.

649
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:26,122
We'll see you down in the lobby, 7:15.
Don't be late, you hear?

650
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,358
Fine.

651
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,002
That man will never get to Chicago alive.

652
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:38,598
The real dark horse in this year's
Οscar derby seems to be Diana Вarrie.

653
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:41,369
Οne of the most respected actresses
in the business...

654
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:44,725
...and perhaps best known
for portrayals of Shakespearean queens...

655
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,687
...and Pinter heroines
at London's National Theatre.

656
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:50,283
- Diana is up for her first Οscar...
- Hello?

657
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:52,878
Yes.

658
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:56,519
We'll be down in five minutes.

659
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,283
Thank you.

660
00:42:58,929 --> 00:43:00,362
- Sidney?
- Yes?

661
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:04,565
Sidney, take a look and...

662
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,127
...try to be gentle.

663
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,923
Channel 2 just picked you as a dark horse.

664
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:14,448
- They must have seen the dress.
- You hate it.

665
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:16,482
- How much was it?
- Nothing.

666
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:19,003
- Joe Pickman paid for it.
- Then I love it.

667
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:22,527
I wish you didn't have such good taste.

668
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,881
I have a definite hump on my left shoulder.

669
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:32,282
It cost 500 pounds
and I look like Richard III.

670
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:35,444
Do you notice the hump, Sidney?

671
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:38,839
- Isn't that your regular hump?
- Don't joke.

672
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:42,604
- I am going on national television.
- There are no humps.

673
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:45,638
I can see no humps at this particular time.

674
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:48,197
I should have worn something simple.

675
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:50,802
My black pantsuit.

676
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:53,763
Why the hell didn't I wear
my black pantsuit?

677
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,881
- Because I am wearing it.
- We should never have come.

678
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,085
I never know how to dress in this country.

679
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,639
It's so easy to dress in England.
You just put on warm clothing.

680
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:06,481
- Why did we come, Sidney?
- Because it's free, darling.

681
00:44:07,209 --> 00:44:10,724
Glenda Jackson never comes.
She's nominated every goddamned year.

682
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:15,565
We could have stayed in London
and waited for a telephone call.

683
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:18,038
David Niven could have accepted for me.

684
00:44:18,129 --> 00:44:20,848
He'd have been witty
and no one would have noticed my hump.

685
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:21,964
Use it, sweetheart.

686
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:25,485
People will pity you for your deformity
and you're sure to win.

687
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:28,085
Maybe if you put your arm on my shoulder.

688
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:30,478
Keep your arm on my shoulder at all times.

689
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,720
If I win, we'll go up together,
your arm around me.

690
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:37,442
They'll think we're still mad for each other
after 12 years.

691
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:39,804
I thought we were. I keep forgetting.

692
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:43,606
- How many gin and tonics have you had?
- Three gins and one tonic.

693
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:45,088
Catch up on the tonics.

694
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:47,763
We don't want to be disgusting tonight,
do we?

695
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:51,961
What's wrong with my hair?

696
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:55,004
I look like I've combed it with a towel.

697
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:58,684
When you played Elizabeth, you looked
like a warthog and never complained.

698
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:02,239
That was acting, this is living.
Living, I want to be beautiful.

699
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:04,841
It's the strangest colour.

700
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:08,717
I asked for a simple rinse
and that ditsy queen's given me crayons.

701
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:11,125
Shall I walk with my arm
on your head as well?

702
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,528
Oh, Christ.

703
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:15,078
I hate getting dressed like this.

704
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:18,806
Why is it I'm always perfectly comfortable
as somebody else?

705
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:21,164
I'd have been perfectly happy
going as Hedda Gabler.

706
00:45:21,249 --> 00:45:23,365
- Try Quasimodo.
- Try shutting up.

707
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:26,528
Now check me out.

708
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:30,404
- Do I have too much jewellry on?
- Jingle it. I can't tell if I don't hear it.

709
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:33,401
Will you please be nice to me
and pay me one bloody compliment?

710
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:36,481
I've been getting ready
for this horseshit affair for three hours.

711
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:39,037
- You're just...
- What? What?

712
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:44,840
I was going to say you're making
a mountain out of a molehill.

713
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:46,760
But I didn't think it would amuse you.

714
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,488
That's not funny, Sidney. That's bizarre.

715
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:51,688
Give me a drink.

716
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:56,118
You have the most bizarre
sense of humour.

717
00:45:56,209 --> 00:45:58,120
Bizarre people often do.

718
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,243
Give me a bit more.

719
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,763
It's all right,
I won't get pissed till after I lose.

720
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:06,077
The car is waiting.

721
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:10,401
Oh, God,
why do they have these things so early?

722
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:13,287
No woman can look good
at 5:00 in the afternoon...

723
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:16,202
...except possibly Tatum O'Neal.

724
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:17,848
Finish your drink.

725
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:21,527
I don't want to miss
the sound editing awards.

726
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:25,038
Those bloody photographers and newsmen.

727
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:29,000
I can't wait to see
how they explain my hump in the papers.

728
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:36,325
- Where you going?
- I need another drink.

729
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:38,445
The last one wore off in the lift.

730
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:43,842
- Gin and tonic, please.
- Nothing for me.

731
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:49,118
I heard that if you're late,
they put nondescript people in your seats.

732
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:51,165
Do you know what I might do next year?

733
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:53,001
I pray, anything but lbsen.

734
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:55,968
I might give it all up. It's no fun anymore.

735
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:58,609
How I envy you.
You're the one with all the talent.

736
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:00,964
I'm the one who has to make
a horse's ass of myself.

737
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:02,926
Talent? What talent do I have?

738
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:05,569
You have nothing but talent.
You cook better than I do...

739
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:08,800
...you write better than I do.
God knows you dress better than I do.

740
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:11,278
Better than I. The "do" is superfluous.

741
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:13,167
You speak better than I do.

742
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:15,599
What's that green slime you're eating?

743
00:47:15,689 --> 00:47:18,362
- It looks like a dish out of Οliνer Twist.
- I'm not sure.

744
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:21,247
I think they ran the front lawn
through a blender.

745
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:23,724
You've got that glazed look in your eye.

746
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:25,879
That bored-with-her-life attitude.

747
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:30,201
I'm never bored with your life, my angel.
I love the openings, and the parties.

748
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:32,361
I lead a very gay life.

749
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:34,447
Let's be honest, pet.

750
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:37,123
How many antique dealers
go to the Academy Awards?

751
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:40,246
You hate that dusty little shop.
You're never there when I call.

752
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,285
Could I, Miss Barrie? It's for my daughter.

753
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:43,324
- Certainly.
- Excuse me.

754
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:46,481
- What's her name?
- Just say, "To Frank."

755
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:52,767
What do you do with your afternoons?

756
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:56,369
In London?
I don't think we have afternoons.

757
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:00,484
- Gin and tonic...
- Check, please.

758
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:06,038
Come along.

759
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:12,759
You should never have given it up, Sidney.

760
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:14,601
- What?
- Acting.

761
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:18,486
Christ, you were good.
You had more promise then any of us.

762
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:21,242
Really?
I can't think what it was I promised.

763
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:23,365
You were so gentle on the stage.

764
00:48:23,649 --> 00:48:27,483
So unselfish, so giving.
You had a sweet, gentle quality.

765
00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:30,717
Yes, I would have made
a wonderful Ophelia.

766
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:32,885
You could go back, Sidney,
if you wanted to.

767
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:35,529
We could do plays together,
have more time together.

768
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:37,247
No, there'd be problems.

769
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:40,366
It would be awful
if we were both up for the same part.

770
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,401
I'm perfectly happy
selling my 18th-century door knockers.

771
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,844
You haven't told me
what you do with your afternoons.

772
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,920
I told you, I look for knockers.

773
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,288
I think I got it stopped.

774
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:56,678
Don't use the water
in the bathroom for a while.

775
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:59,078
It's okay.
We have enough on the floor to last.

776
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,204
Thank you.

777
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:03,687
- Okay. Hurry up.
- What? Lola.

778
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,599
The man is 20 minutes late.

779
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:10,963
How would you like to be
lying on an operating table...

780
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:14,405
...with tubes going in your nose,
waiting for him to show up?

781
00:49:15,049 --> 00:49:18,644
Your brother's going to pay for this.
I'm tired of being nice to that man.

782
00:49:18,729 --> 00:49:21,846
Next time I take his x-rays,
wait till I tell him what I found.

783
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:25,399
My feet are still wet.
The foot powder is turning into concrete.

784
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,565
Nine Japanese restaurants in ten nights!

785
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:30,527
I am sick of stepping on raw fish
in my stockinged feet...

786
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:32,565
...that that man drops on the floor.
Come on.

787
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:34,401
This is Pearl Harbor night!

788
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:41,518
- Can we get going? I'll drive.
- You'll what?

789
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:43,486
- Do you know where Fujiyama's is?
- No.

790
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:45,799
- I'll drive.
- Why don't you two argue in the back?

791
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:47,322
- I'll drive.
- Okay, honey.

792
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:49,923
Okay, honey?
Watch out when he says, "Okay, honey."

793
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:01,526
I feel like a caged animal, Sidney.

794
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:04,043
They look as though
they're going to throw nuts at us.

795
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:07,963
Nonsense, darling, they're just ogling us.
I adore being ogled.

796
00:50:08,129 --> 00:50:09,926
- Oh, Sidney.
- Yes?

797
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:14,167
Sidney, kiss me.
Kiss me and wish me luck.

798
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:18,442
There's your kiss.

799
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:21,282
Now turn around,
so I can rub your hump for luck.

800
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:26,487
Sidney, please be nice to me.
I'm scared to death.

801
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:28,842
I wish you everything.

802
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:31,966
I wish you luck, I wish you love,
I wish you happiness.

803
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,759
You are a gifted and remarkable woman.

804
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:36,965
I hope you win the bloody Oscar.

805
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:40,839
Fifty years from now,
I'll be able to sell it for a fortune.

806
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:44,681
Just hold my hand, angel.

807
00:50:57,729 --> 00:51:01,483
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
to again proνe that the Academy Awards...

808
00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:03,480
...are indeed international in scope...

809
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:06,003
...we're so pleased
to welcome here from London...

810
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:08,808
...the Academy Award nominee
for her best performance...

811
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:11,449
...in that wonderful picture
No Right Turns...

812
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:13,402
No, it's called No Left Turns.

813
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:18,085
Miss Diana Вarrie,
and her handsome husband, Sidney Вarrie.

814
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:21,165
Sidney Cochran.

815
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:45,567
You say when you put your foot
on the brakes, nothing happened?

816
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:48,721
I didn't say nothing happened.
I said that the brakes didn't work.

817
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:51,323
When the brakes didn't work,
nothing good happened.

818
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:54,128
You snapped the cable holding the cars.

819
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:56,404
I don't think I've ever seen
anything like this.

820
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,081
I thought it was a jet.

821
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:01,482
I thought,
"Oh, God, we've just been 747'd."

822
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:06,045
My legs are paralysed. I can't move.

823
00:52:06,129 --> 00:52:08,962
We're going to get you out
as fast as we can, all right?

824
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:12,007
I'm not in the car.
I'm sitting in a Japanese restaurant.

825
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:13,920
We'll get you a cup of coffee, all right?

826
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,322
Congratulations.

827
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:50,326
Come on, it's after 3:00 a.m.

828
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:53,489
Don't give me that superior-than-thou crap.

829
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:56,200
You're stinking, aren't you?

830
00:52:57,569 --> 00:53:01,448
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm a lady. A loser and a lady.

831
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:05,642
One of the great losing ladies
of the cinema.

832
00:53:14,049 --> 00:53:15,846
You remember that
night up in the Catskills...

833
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:18,921
...when you ran away
and you came back an hour later...

834
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:21,443
...because you stepped
in the cow doo-doo?

835
00:53:25,009 --> 00:53:26,203
That's funny.

836
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:27,968
Am I tanked, Harry.

837
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:31,837
- Are you sure this is the right hotel?
- Don't ask me. I'm blind.

838
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:35,761
Hey, boobie, thanks for a terrific evening.

839
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:39,762
Thank me in the morning.
The night is not over yet.

840
00:53:40,689 --> 00:53:42,680
What do you mean?
What are you smiling about?

841
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:45,727
Sleep well, kid.
Don't forget to leave an early wake-up call.

842
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:48,687
What are you talking about?
What's going on here?

843
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:53,887
I don't trust that guy.
Something is going on here.

844
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:15,448
Hi. I'm Bunny.

845
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:19,564
Is this 203?

846
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:25,804
"Happy birthday from your brother Harry,
Happy birthday to you"

847
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:29,961
This is not my birthday.

848
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:33,481
- My birthday isn't until next month.
- I'm in no hurry.

849
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:39,005
Tequila?

850
00:54:42,129 --> 00:54:45,485
You never told me what award I missed
when I went to the can.

851
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:48,199
- The best documentary short subject.
- Oh, damn it.

852
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:49,768
My favourite category.

853
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:52,038
What won?

854
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:55,088
The Midgets of Leipzig,
a Czech-Polish production.

855
00:54:55,169 --> 00:54:57,000
Sigmund Wednetski, producer.

856
00:54:57,409 --> 00:55:01,163
Directed by Litweil Zumbredowicz
and Stefan Vlech.

857
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:04,839
I thought they would.
What was the best picture?

858
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:08,447
The best picture?
You were there when they announced it.

859
00:55:08,529 --> 00:55:10,440
It came after the best actress.

860
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:14,444
I was in a deep depression at the time.
What was the best bloody picture?

861
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:16,247
You mean what was the best picture...

862
00:55:16,329 --> 00:55:18,684
...or what did those idiots pick
as the best picture?

863
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:21,727
What won the award, you asshole?

864
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:24,483
I am not an asshole.
Don't you call me that.

865
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:27,966
I have just thrown up
on some of the best people in Hollywood.

866
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:31,485
Now is no time to be sensitive.
What was the best picture?

867
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:32,763
I'm not telling you.

868
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:35,647
I'm not asking you,
I'm threatening you, you crud.

869
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:37,725
Now I'm definitely not going to tell you.

870
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:40,960
I'm sorry, I take it back, Sidney.
You're not a crud. God!

871
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:42,687
- Am I still an asshole?
- Definitely.

872
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:45,442
I'm never going to tell you.
You behaved abominably tonight.

873
00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:48,123
- Did not.
- Abominably!

874
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:49,881
- Asshole, crud!
- I am going to bed.

875
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:52,278
We have a 10:00 a.m. Plane to catch
in the morning.

876
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:54,166
10:00 a.m. Is the morning.

877
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:57,643
That is redundant, you A.H.

878
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:00,760
Do you think I don't know
what you're saying?

879
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:04,364
- I can spell, you know.
- Not without moving your lips, you can't.

880
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:06,282
I would like another drink, please.

881
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:09,008
You drank everything in this state.
Try Nevada.

882
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:15,798
Sidney. I saw your privates.

883
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:18,597
You were right.

884
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:21,002
We should never have come here.

885
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:23,000
Ever see a greater assemblage
of hypocrites...

886
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,159
...under one roof in all your life?

887
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:28,679
Were the hypocrites there?
Why didn't you point them out to me?

888
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:30,487
Hypocritical hypocrites.

889
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:33,125
They love you and fawn over you
on the way in.

890
00:56:33,209 --> 00:56:36,599
If you're a loser when you come out,
it's, "Too bad, darling.

891
00:56:36,689 --> 00:56:39,157
"Give us a call when you're back in town."

892
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:41,723
You should've thrown up
over the bloody lot of them.

893
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:43,720
- Sidney?
- Yes?

894
00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:46,966
Was I hit by a bus?

895
00:56:49,249 --> 00:56:52,878
I look as though I was hit
by a fully-loaded guided tour bus.

896
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:56,803
Did you notice how quickly
the winners got their cars?

897
00:56:56,889 --> 00:56:59,642
They must've known beforehand
who the winners would be...

898
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:03,005
...in order for the winners to get their cars
before everyone else.

899
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:07,287
We come 6,000 miles for this bloody
affair and they park our car in Vancouver.

900
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:11,399
I've aged, Sidney.
I'm getting lines in my face.

901
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:16,322
I look like a brand-new
steel-belted radial tire.

902
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:20,677
Even Litweil Zumbredowicz
and Stefan Vlech got their cars before us.

903
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:22,487
And then those little twerps...

904
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:25,925
...they splashed water all over
my trousers as they drove by.

905
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,528
I'm hungry.

906
00:57:29,729 --> 00:57:32,289
- What are you doing?
- I'm phoning room service.

907
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:34,087
I want some eggs Benedict.

908
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:36,319
Hello.

909
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:39,006
Yes, eggs Benedict, please.

910
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:41,889
You have to ask
for room service first, twit.

911
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:47,161
Room service, please. Twit and a half.

912
00:57:48,449 --> 00:57:49,598
Touché.

913
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:53,200
Isn't there anyone there?
I only wanted some eggs Benedict.

914
00:57:59,049 --> 00:57:59,959
I see.

915
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:05,320
Just isn't my night, is it?

916
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:09,322
Where are you going?

917
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:12,646
To their bloody kitchen
to make myself some eggs Benedict.

918
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:13,964
Twit.

919
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:15,523
Twitette.

920
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,727
I don't feel so good.

921
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:33,809
- What is it?
- Raw fish and wet feet.

922
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:37,964
I'd like to throw up,
but the room is too small.

923
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:42,444
Lola.

924
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:45,608
I think I'm gonna throw up. I'm positive.

925
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:48,798
Lola.

926
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:52,364
Lola!

927
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:02,927
- Who could that be at this hour?
- Who do you think?

928
00:59:04,129 --> 00:59:07,121
Their game plan
is to see that we don't get any sleep.

929
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:08,958
Hello.

930
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:10,844
It's Lola.

931
00:59:11,609 --> 00:59:12,644
Yes, Lola.

932
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:14,798
What?

933
00:59:15,929 --> 00:59:17,157
You're kidding.

934
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:20,602
Tell him to take two compid spansules.

935
00:59:22,249 --> 00:59:23,125
What?

936
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:26,523
Listen, I don't make house calls
when I'm working.

937
00:59:26,609 --> 00:59:28,679
Why should I when I'm on vacation?

938
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:32,282
All right. I'll be there, all right.

939
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,841
He's purposely doing this.

940
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:38,206
He knows that I don't play well
without eight hours of sleep.

941
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:39,768
I'll give him some sleeping pills.

942
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:42,647
He won't be able to raise his racket
for a week.

943
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:45,079
Don't start in, he'll sue you for malpractice.

944
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:46,761
But we'll win the match.

945
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:07,599
I found the people at the Oscars
singularly unattractive this year.

946
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:10,318
Didn't you?

947
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:12,443
Oh, Christ!

948
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:16,728
I noticed a general decline
in face-lifts and hair transplants.

949
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:21,641
- Must be the economy, don't you think?
- Did you get your eggs Benedictined?

950
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:24,725
Bitchy. Bitchy, darling.

951
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:28,521
You haven't started anything naughty
without me, have you?

952
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:30,884
I didn't expect to see you until dawn.

953
01:00:31,249 --> 01:00:33,888
I heard lots of other cats
prowling around out there.

954
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:37,757
We're not all as lucky as you, Sidney.
You got your prowling in early.

955
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:39,688
Who was he, Sidney?

956
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:43,288
What are you talking about?

957
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:47,044
That adorable young actor
you were chatting with all night.

958
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:48,881
Gorgeous, wasn't he?

959
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:52,440
- Where did you find him?
- He was at our table.

960
01:00:52,969 --> 01:00:54,607
We shared a butter plate.

961
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:58,002
- How spreadably cosy.
- Careful, darling.

962
01:00:59,169 --> 01:01:01,080
We're tired and we're smashed.

963
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:04,847
- Let's not get into shallow waters.
- I am sorry.

964
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:08,878
Let's just talk show biz, shall we?

965
01:01:09,329 --> 01:01:11,524
Who did you vote for tonight, Sidney?

966
01:01:12,049 --> 01:01:13,482
I don't vote, dear.

967
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:15,839
I'm not a member
of the Motion Picture Academy.

968
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:17,567
I am an antique dealer.

969
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:22,322
One day, when you're an antique,
I shall vote for you. That's a promise.

970
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,318
I mean, who did you vote for privately?

971
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:31,569
In the deep, inner-twit recesses
of your redundant mind.

972
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:36,759
When Miss No-Talent ran up there
all teeth and teary-eyed...

973
01:01:37,729 --> 01:01:41,244
...I could feel the tension release
from every part of your body.

974
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,605
What a nasty streak you have
when you drink.

975
01:01:43,689 --> 01:01:45,805
Also when you eat and sit and walk.

976
01:01:46,209 --> 01:01:48,598
Picky, Sidney.

977
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:51,726
Are you unhappy because
you didn't get to wear my dress?

978
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:54,602
If I had worn your dress,
it would have hung properly.

979
01:01:54,689 --> 01:01:56,202
Nothing personal.

980
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:58,968
There never is anything personal
between us, is there?

981
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,279
Or is that getting too personal?

982
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,124
I was devastated when you lost.

983
01:02:07,609 --> 01:02:10,760
But look at it this way:
It's just a little bald, naked statue.

984
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:12,123
Just like you'll be, one day.

985
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:15,645
Did he carve his telephone number
in your butter patty for you?

986
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:17,438
Go to hell.

987
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:20,726
What's this, Sidney, a direct assault?
A frontal attack?

988
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:22,561
That's not like you, Sidney.

989
01:02:22,649 --> 01:02:25,880
Wit and parry, wit and parry,
that's more your style.

990
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:28,523
You make me sick.
When you can't have what you want...

991
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:30,884
...you make certain
everyone is equally as miserable.

992
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:32,766
I haven't noticed any equals around me.

993
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:36,125
It's amazing how you can throw up
verbally as well as nutritionally.

994
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:39,485
Adam. That was his name, wasn't it?
Adam, the first man.

995
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:41,486
It's not very appropriate for you, is it?

996
01:02:41,569 --> 01:02:43,560
Diana, come off it.

997
01:02:44,049 --> 01:02:46,279
We keep up a front for everyone else.

998
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:48,163
Why not for ourselves?

999
01:02:48,249 --> 01:02:50,843
Lie to each other
that we're perfectly well-mated?

1000
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:52,920
A closet couple, is that what you mean?

1001
01:02:53,009 --> 01:02:55,477
I have never hidden behind closed doors...

1002
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:57,122
...but I am discreet.

1003
01:02:57,489 --> 01:02:59,127
Discreet?

1004
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:02,483
You did everything but lick his artichoke.

1005
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:05,443
Please, let's not have a discretion contest.

1006
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:08,568
I have heard about your lunch breaks
on the set.

1007
01:03:08,649 --> 01:03:11,880
The only thing you don't do
in your dressing room is dress.

1008
01:03:13,809 --> 01:03:18,166
Now I've lost count of my Librium.
If I'm not up by 9:00, I've overdosed.

1009
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:20,320
Why is he coming to England?

1010
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:21,644
Who?

1011
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,163
That boy.

1012
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:26,523
He said, "See you in London next week."

1013
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:29,482
What's he doing in London?

1014
01:03:29,569 --> 01:03:30,922
Acting, of course.

1015
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:33,001
He's making a film there.

1016
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:35,163
What film?

1017
01:03:35,569 --> 01:03:38,800
I don't follow other people's films.
I barely follow yours.

1018
01:03:40,369 --> 01:03:41,722
Goddamn him!

1019
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:45,203
And goddamn you, goddamn the Oscars.

1020
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:48,117
Goddamn California, goddamn everything!

1021
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:51,844
What is it about this climate
that brings out the religion in you?

1022
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:54,122
Why don't you love me?

1023
01:03:54,649 --> 01:03:56,128
What film is that line from?

1024
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:57,881
You bastard, answer the question.

1025
01:03:57,969 --> 01:03:59,322
Why don't you love me?

1026
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:01,365
It didn't sound like a question.

1027
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:05,884
I'm tired of paying for everything
and getting nothing in return.

1028
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:09,557
I thought Joe Pickman paid for everything.

1029
01:04:09,689 --> 01:04:13,887
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be here
tonight to have arranged to meet him...

1030
01:04:13,969 --> 01:04:15,607
...in London next week.

1031
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:18,404
Why don't you love me anymore, Sidney?

1032
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:20,805
I've never stopped loving you...

1033
01:04:21,009 --> 01:04:22,158
...in my way.

1034
01:04:23,489 --> 01:04:25,480
Your way doesn't do me any good.

1035
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:27,884
Diana...

1036
01:04:28,249 --> 01:04:29,921
...it is nearly 4:00 a.m.

1037
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:33,966
Now is not a good time
to discuss biological discrepancies.

1038
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:36,444
Faggot!

1039
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:39,043
Oh, good. I thought you'd never ask.

1040
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:43,320
Don't turn away from me.
I'm so miserable.

1041
01:04:43,409 --> 01:04:45,240
Sidney, don't do this to me.

1042
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:47,804
Please.

1043
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:50,118
I'm sorry.

1044
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:53,923
It hasn't been a winning evening, has it?

1045
01:04:54,169 --> 01:04:55,841
Screw the Oscars.

1046
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:57,840
Screw the Academy Awards.

1047
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:00,762
Screw me, Sidney, please. Please.

1048
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:01,998
Please.

1049
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:05,966
I didn't mean that.
I don't want to put you off your game.

1050
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:08,367
I am always here for you.

1051
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:13,445
My friendly filling station.

1052
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:18,882
Why don't you stick to your own kind?

1053
01:05:19,569 --> 01:05:23,005
If there's anything I hate,
it's a bisexual homosexual.

1054
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:26,439
Or is it the other way around?

1055
01:05:26,649 --> 01:05:28,082
It works either way.

1056
01:05:28,209 --> 01:05:31,406
Jesus God, Sidney. I love you so much.

1057
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:35,008
I know that, darling.

1058
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:36,681
Why do you stay with me?

1059
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:39,841
What do you get from me
that could possibly satisfy you?

1060
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:41,840
A wider circle of prospects.

1061
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:45,283
I'm a minor celebrity, once removed.

1062
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:50,609
Sorry, I didn't win that award tonight.

1063
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:54,687
Your dance card
would have been filled for a year.

1064
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:57,319
We haven't done too badly together.

1065
01:05:57,849 --> 01:06:00,283
I'm kinder to you
than your average stunt man.

1066
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:01,768
There was a time...

1067
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:06,047
...when I thought
you'd give it all up for me.

1068
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:12,927
I love you, my angel.

1069
01:06:14,049 --> 01:06:16,165
More than any woman I've ever known.

1070
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:19,764
Christ, I can't get a break.

1071
01:06:22,209 --> 01:06:23,642
I do the best I can.

1072
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:25,798
Thank you.

1073
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:28,763
- You can't say we don't have fun together.
- Hell, no.

1074
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:32,046
The dinner conversations alone
are worth the trouble.

1075
01:06:43,969 --> 01:06:46,767
Sorry, Sidney, it wasn't the kiss.
It's my life.

1076
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:50,764
Tired? Come on.

1077
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:55,237
Losing Oscars always does that to me.

1078
01:06:56,529 --> 01:06:59,965
I'll get up first thing
and order your eggs Benedict.

1079
01:07:00,689 --> 01:07:03,567
You do take care of me, Sidney.
I'll say that.

1080
01:07:04,849 --> 01:07:07,443
And good help is so hard to find
these days.

1081
01:07:08,049 --> 01:07:10,882
You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.

1082
01:07:15,049 --> 01:07:16,721
It's been an evening of...

1083
01:07:18,009 --> 01:07:20,523
...ups and downs, hasn't it?

1084
01:07:25,009 --> 01:07:27,079
Care to continue the motion?

1085
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:36,364
Tacky.

1086
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:39,524
You're getting tacky, my angel.

1087
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:42,761
I love you, Sidney.

1088
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:55,765
Don't close your eyes, Sidney.

1089
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:58,126
I always close my eyes.

1090
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:01,118
Not tonight.

1091
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:05,279
Look at me tonight.

1092
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:10,920
Let it be me tonight.

1093
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:22,924
Long.

1094
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:26,282
- What?
- Long. The serve was long.

1095
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,208
You're half asleep.
How can you see the serve was long?

1096
01:08:29,289 --> 01:08:32,440
I saw it with the half that was awake.
Second serve.

1097
01:08:33,449 --> 01:08:35,007
I hope he knows about orthopaedics...

1098
01:08:35,089 --> 01:08:37,728
...because he won't be able to walk
after this.

1099
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:41,564
Long. Double fault.

1100
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:44,083
- Love-fifteen.
- What? What?

1101
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:47,246
How can you call that ball long?

1102
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:50,241
It's simple, like this: Long!

1103
01:08:50,889 --> 01:08:53,119
- Now serve the ball.
- Serve the ball.

1104
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:54,437
We only have the court an hour.

1105
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:56,326
After I serve, head for the clubhouse...

1106
01:08:56,409 --> 01:08:59,719
...because there's not going to be
any survivors after this.

1107
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:01,803
You ready?

1108
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,520
Get a towel somebody, quick.

1109
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:16,360
- I'm sorry.
- Lf it hurts, massage it.

1110
01:09:16,449 --> 01:09:18,201
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1111
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:19,517
- You all right?
- It was my fault.

1112
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:22,442
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- All right, fault, second serve.

1113
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:26,001
Let them have the room tonight, please.
It's safer.

1114
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:29,478
Never again.

1115
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,447
Oh, God.

1116
01:09:44,129 --> 01:09:46,643
What are you doing here?
I thought you left.

1117
01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:54,644
Come on. You can't stay here. Wake up.

1118
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:05,478
10:45.

1119
01:10:06,129 --> 01:10:08,040
Jesus Christ, it's 10:45.

1120
01:10:08,729 --> 01:10:12,688
Wake up. Don't you understand?
It's 10:45.

1121
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:16,046
Crazy. I must be crazy.

1122
01:10:22,809 --> 01:10:26,643
Hello, operator, what time is it? 10:45?
Why didn't you call me?

1123
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:31,084
I left a wake-up call for 8:00 this morning.

1124
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:32,079
I did.

1125
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:33,524
I didn't?

1126
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:35,645
You should have called me anyway.

1127
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:37,401
Come on. Get up.

1128
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:39,480
My wife could walk in any minute.

1129
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,799
What's wrong with you?

1130
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:44,327
Are you deaf or something?

1131
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:47,642
You all right?

1132
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:51,848
What did you do?

1133
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:55,167
You drank an entire bottle of tequila
with my wife coming in?

1134
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:56,682
Are you crazy?

1135
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,084
God.

1136
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:00,959
Listen.

1137
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:04,406
You've got to sleep this off elsewhere.

1138
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:06,764
This is a bad place to sleep this off.

1139
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:09,159
Water.

1140
01:11:09,249 --> 01:11:11,205
How about some nice water?

1141
01:11:13,689 --> 01:11:15,839
Here, lady, sip a little water.

1142
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:20,403
Drink, sweetheart, for my sake.

1143
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:24,365
Open your lips, you crazy broad.

1144
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:41,564
Don't panic.

1145
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:45,722
Panic is the quickest way to divorce.
I must not panic.

1146
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:54,401
Move! Move!

1147
01:11:56,369 --> 01:12:00,965
Please, God, make her move.
I'll never be a bad person again, I promise.

1148
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:04,724
All right.

1149
01:12:04,809 --> 01:12:07,482
We're going to get you dressed
and down into a cab.

1150
01:12:07,569 --> 01:12:08,843
That's it.

1151
01:12:11,249 --> 01:12:13,160
I'm really sorry this happened.

1152
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:16,367
It was a wonderful evening,
whoever the hell you are.

1153
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:18,924
Come on, darling, push.

1154
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:21,441
Get your leg in there.

1155
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:23,645
Get your foot in there and push.

1156
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:27,325
Come on, push darling.

1157
01:12:27,809 --> 01:12:28,844
Push.

1158
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:31,284
Get your feet in here.

1159
01:12:35,329 --> 01:12:37,638
Put your legs up and push.

1160
01:12:38,009 --> 01:12:40,284
Get the... Come on.

1161
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:46,559
You're not going to help me, right?

1162
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,878
Think, Marvin.

1163
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,361
Change rooms.
Let some other idiot get stuck with her.

1164
01:12:56,849 --> 01:13:00,125
Hello, operator, get me the front desk.
This is an emergency.

1165
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,244
Listen to me.

1166
01:13:01,329 --> 01:13:03,399
I have two wonderful children
who need a father.

1167
01:13:03,489 --> 01:13:04,968
Don't do this to me.

1168
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:09,321
Hello, this is Mr. Michaels
in Suite 203 and 204.

1169
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:13,358
I'm very uncomfortable in this room.
The bed is very bad for my back.

1170
01:13:13,449 --> 01:13:16,521
When I woke up this morning,
I thought my life was over.

1171
01:13:17,569 --> 01:13:20,959
We don't have another vacancy
until 2:00 this afternoon.

1172
01:13:22,089 --> 01:13:24,205
One moment. May I help you, ma'am?

1173
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:26,678
Marvin Michaels.
I'm Mrs. Marvin Michaels.

1174
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:29,044
- He's on the phone now. Suite 203.
- Thank you.

1175
01:13:29,129 --> 01:13:30,801
Would you tell him I'll be right up?

1176
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:33,847
Mr. Michaels? As I was saying...

1177
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:37,084
We can have a very nice suite for you
after 2:00.

1178
01:13:37,169 --> 01:13:38,363
I can't wait until after 2:00.

1179
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:40,440
My wife is coming in any minute now...

1180
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:44,044
...and I know she's not going to be happy
once she sees this room.

1181
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:45,164
Who's here?

1182
01:13:45,249 --> 01:13:46,204
My wife?

1183
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,408
My wife is here?

1184
01:13:49,489 --> 01:13:51,957
You sent my wife up here
without calling me?

1185
01:13:52,409 --> 01:13:55,560
What the hell kind of a cheap hotel
are you running here?

1186
01:13:55,649 --> 01:13:58,243
Send somebody to stop her
before she sees this bed.

1187
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:00,365
It could ruin her entire vacation.

1188
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:01,764
I could jump.

1189
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:04,522
With two broken legs,
she'd never be angry with me.

1190
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:05,963
Oh, my God!

1191
01:14:07,969 --> 01:14:10,847
- Marvin?
- Oh, God!

1192
01:14:13,289 --> 01:14:14,244
Marvin.

1193
01:14:15,169 --> 01:14:17,080
Hello? Marvin?

1194
01:14:20,929 --> 01:14:22,123
Open the door.

1195
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:26,360
- Just a minute.
- What are you doing?

1196
01:14:26,449 --> 01:14:29,043
Rearranging the furniture? Open the door.

1197
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:31,003
I'm going into the other room...

1198
01:14:31,089 --> 01:14:34,798
...once I'm in there, lock this door
and don't open it for anyone.

1199
01:14:35,249 --> 01:14:36,318
What?

1200
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:38,288
I can't hear you.

1201
01:14:40,489 --> 01:14:41,558
Who is it?

1202
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,560
It's me. Millie.

1203
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:45,407
- Millie?
- Yes.

1204
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:47,322
In a minute.

1205
01:14:52,449 --> 01:14:53,245
Millie.

1206
01:14:53,329 --> 01:14:55,160
Hello. Thank you for opening the door.

1207
01:14:55,249 --> 01:14:56,477
Hello, sweetie.

1208
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:00,003
Why didn't you pick me up at the airport?

1209
01:15:00,849 --> 01:15:02,168
- Why?
- Yes, why?

1210
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:04,684
Why.

1211
01:15:05,289 --> 01:15:06,961
I've been sick all day.

1212
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:10,967
I just threw up in the other room.
Don't go in there.

1213
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:13,924
The doctor left about ten minutes ago.

1214
01:15:14,809 --> 01:15:17,084
I have acute gastro-enteritis.

1215
01:15:19,129 --> 01:15:21,359
- But it's nothing to worry about.
- God.

1216
01:15:22,169 --> 01:15:23,648
When did this happen?

1217
01:15:24,209 --> 01:15:26,120
About 2:00 in the morning.

1218
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:31,086
You look terrible.
Why don't you get into bed, honey.

1219
01:15:31,169 --> 01:15:33,399
You'll feel better.
You'll be more comfortable.

1220
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:35,878
Oh, no! I'm not supposed to lie down.

1221
01:15:36,049 --> 01:15:37,277
It makes me nauseous.

1222
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:39,724
It just makes me nauseous lying down.

1223
01:15:39,929 --> 01:15:41,567
You're so sweet.

1224
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:46,606
I feel much better in this room.
It's so much cheerier.

1225
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:49,240
I think you'd better lie down.

1226
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,719
I need some compazine spansules.

1227
01:15:56,049 --> 01:15:57,164
What's that?

1228
01:15:57,769 --> 01:16:00,647
It stops nausea. Compazine spansules.

1229
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:02,367
Did you call the drugstore downstairs?

1230
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:05,168
Yes. They don't carry it.
It has codeine in it.

1231
01:16:05,249 --> 01:16:08,286
The nearest place for it is a drugstore
on Santa Monica Boulevard.

1232
01:16:08,369 --> 01:16:11,202
But they don't deliver.
I have to go down there myself.

1233
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:14,838
All right, I'll go. Where's the prescription?

1234
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:17,523
- What prescription?
- Didn't the doctor give you one?

1235
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:19,201
You can't get codeine without it.

1236
01:16:19,289 --> 01:16:21,678
Yes, you can. In California you can.

1237
01:16:21,809 --> 01:16:25,119
- Compazine spansules.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

1238
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:27,279
- Now?
- I haven't gone in four hours.

1239
01:16:27,369 --> 01:16:30,281
I told you, I just threw up in there.
All over.

1240
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:34,277
Please, give me the opportunity, then,
of making it presentable first.

1241
01:16:34,569 --> 01:16:36,480
It means a great deal to me.

1242
01:16:37,769 --> 01:16:39,646
We've been married for 15 years.

1243
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:42,038
You've never cleaned up
a bathroom before.

1244
01:16:42,129 --> 01:16:44,438
I think it's high time I started.

1245
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:46,883
Don't you?

1246
01:16:48,649 --> 01:16:50,924
Please, I'll be right out.

1247
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:57,602
Sit down for a minute. Here.

1248
01:16:57,689 --> 01:16:58,838
Have a piece of fruit.

1249
01:16:58,929 --> 01:17:00,760
Clean up the bathroom, okay?

1250
01:17:13,169 --> 01:17:14,761
I'm sorry, Miss.

1251
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:17,963
I'm going to have
to leave you out in the hall.

1252
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:21,007
Don't worry about it,
they'll take care of you.

1253
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:22,848
They have very good service here.

1254
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:36,446
- Mr. Michaels?
- Oh, Christ!

1255
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:40,038
- Don't ever do that.
- I'm sorry.

1256
01:17:40,529 --> 01:17:43,521
- I was just bringing up Mrs. Michaels' bag.
- Oh, good.

1257
01:17:43,609 --> 01:17:46,646
They found your bag, honey.
She was very worried about it.

1258
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:48,765
She was just going down to look for it.

1259
01:17:48,849 --> 01:17:50,919
- Do you want it in the bedroom?
- No.

1260
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:53,325
Yes. Leave it there.

1261
01:17:53,489 --> 01:17:55,878
- In the hall?
- Yes. No.

1262
01:17:56,449 --> 01:17:58,917
Give it to me. No, put it in the bedroom.

1263
01:18:01,169 --> 01:18:02,363
Is she all right?

1264
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:05,441
Yes, she's very tired.
She just flew in from New York.

1265
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,447
Thanks very much.

1266
01:18:08,009 --> 01:18:09,840
I'll take care of you later.

1267
01:18:25,169 --> 01:18:26,204
Marvin.

1268
01:18:26,289 --> 01:18:27,642
Why is the door locked?

1269
01:18:27,729 --> 01:18:29,162
I can't hear you.

1270
01:18:29,809 --> 01:18:31,447
I'm in the bathroom cleaning.

1271
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:33,679
I can't wait anymore. Open the door.

1272
01:18:33,769 --> 01:18:35,407
I'll open the door.

1273
01:18:36,529 --> 01:18:38,281
Here comes the door.

1274
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:39,324
Marvin!

1275
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:42,165
The opening of the door is coming.

1276
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:45,049
- What are you doing?
- On the way to the door.

1277
01:18:46,049 --> 01:18:48,119
It's open.
Don't you know how to work a door?

1278
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:50,848
What took so long? You got a girl in here?

1279
01:18:50,929 --> 01:18:55,002
That's right.
I have a beautiful blonde in the bed.

1280
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:57,360
I smell perfume. Woman's perfume.

1281
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:00,441
They spray it in all the rooms.
It's a terrific hotel.

1282
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,684
Oh, God, I'm never going to make it.

1283
01:19:23,129 --> 01:19:25,085
Feel better, sugar pie?

1284
01:19:25,169 --> 01:19:26,397
I got circles under my eyes.

1285
01:19:26,489 --> 01:19:29,526
I didn't sleep all night.
I have to take a nap.

1286
01:19:29,649 --> 01:19:31,958
A nap? Why do you want to take a nap?

1287
01:19:32,049 --> 01:19:35,325
You can nap at the bar mitzvah.
You know how boring they are.

1288
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:37,969
We're never going there
unless I have a few minutes rest.

1289
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:40,199
- Now move over.
- Wait.

1290
01:19:40,369 --> 01:19:43,725
Would you sit down for a minute?
I have to tell you something.

1291
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:45,037
Can I lie down and hear it?

1292
01:19:45,129 --> 01:19:47,927
It's the kind of thing
you should hear sitting up.

1293
01:19:52,089 --> 01:19:53,044
Millie.

1294
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:56,961
You mean more to me...

1295
01:19:57,849 --> 01:19:59,805
...than you could possibly know.

1296
01:20:00,249 --> 01:20:04,128
But sometimes we transgress.
Sometimes we do foolish things...

1297
01:20:04,689 --> 01:20:08,523
...which unwittingly cause hurt
and injury to the other.

1298
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:11,203
I don't think you've ever
consciously hurt me.

1299
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:12,847
Consciously, no.

1300
01:20:13,169 --> 01:20:17,606
But a careless word here,
a foolish gesture there.

1301
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:19,168
Nothing major, Marvin.

1302
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:21,968
We've had disagreements,
but nothing major.

1303
01:20:22,409 --> 01:20:26,197
I'm glad you brought that up, Millie.
What would you consider major?

1304
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:27,284
Major?

1305
01:20:27,769 --> 01:20:30,806
I don't know.
I can't picture you doing anything major.

1306
01:20:30,929 --> 01:20:34,205
I guess if you were cruel to the children,
that would be major.

1307
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:36,325
I would put that Number 1.

1308
01:20:36,489 --> 01:20:40,277
I would say that that was the worse thing
a man could do in a marriage.

1309
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:44,362
To be cruel to children is unpardonable.
All else could be forgiven.

1310
01:20:44,609 --> 01:20:46,645
You with another woman. That'd be major.

1311
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:49,323
Let's not get off the children thing so fast.

1312
01:20:49,489 --> 01:20:54,199
- To me, children are the reflection of...
- Marvin, I've got to lie down.

1313
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:58,157
I've missed you so.

1314
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:06,004
So, let's go to the living room.
God, I've missed you.

1315
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,167
Let's make love in the living room.

1316
01:21:12,249 --> 01:21:14,683
You've missed me?
You've only been away one night.

1317
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:17,806
I know,
but there's a three-hour time difference.

1318
01:21:19,569 --> 01:21:22,641
My God, I've never seen you look so pretty.

1319
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:25,558
Come here, you cute little thing.

1320
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:30,000
Don't be ridiculous,
there's not even a bed in here.

1321
01:21:31,369 --> 01:21:32,848
They have terrific carpeting.

1322
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:37,241
Come on. We tried pot last year.
Let's try carpeting this year.

1323
01:21:37,329 --> 01:21:41,163
Maybe tonight.
If I don't lie down, I'll pass out.

1324
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:45,325
Millie. Wait. No!

1325
01:21:46,129 --> 01:21:48,723
You don't have to get so upset.
I said tonight.

1326
01:21:48,809 --> 01:21:51,562
I've never seen you
so sex-crazed in the morning.

1327
01:21:52,569 --> 01:21:54,446
I didn't realise it was the morning.

1328
01:21:54,529 --> 01:21:59,080
Why don't you just
lie down next to me and relax?

1329
01:21:59,809 --> 01:22:02,448
We don't have to make love.

1330
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:07,280
Just lie down next to me for half an hour.

1331
01:22:07,609 --> 01:22:10,043
Come on. You can do that, can't you?

1332
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:27,122
What are you doing down there?

1333
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:29,040
My back is acting up again.

1334
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:33,002
- The bed is too soft.
- I don't believe that for a second.

1335
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:39,237
Millie, I can't keep this up anymore.
I'm going to get a heart attack.

1336
01:22:39,769 --> 01:22:42,806
I'm going to tell you something,
and this is the truth.

1337
01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:44,362
No more lies.

1338
01:22:46,449 --> 01:22:49,122
It was never my intention
to hurt you, Millie...

1339
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:52,765
...but it's very possible
that in the next few minutes...

1340
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:55,443
...you may be terribly hurt.

1341
01:22:57,249 --> 01:22:59,968
- Is it major or minor?
- To me, it's minor.

1342
01:23:00,049 --> 01:23:03,041
To you, I think it's going to be
extremely major.

1343
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:05,482
Tell me, Marvin.

1344
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:06,968
It couldn't be that bad...

1345
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:10,041
...as long as you're not trying
to cover up something.

1346
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:13,487
I'd like to show you something...

1347
01:23:13,569 --> 01:23:16,242
...but I'm going to ask you
to do something for me first.

1348
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:18,047
Say nothing for 10 seconds.

1349
01:23:18,129 --> 01:23:19,482
Whatever comes to mind...

1350
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:23,562
...please, for the sake of both of us,
say nothing for 10 seconds.

1351
01:23:42,529 --> 01:23:44,201
I'm praying, Marvin.

1352
01:23:44,369 --> 01:23:47,964
I'm praying that the maid
came in to clean...

1353
01:23:48,449 --> 01:23:52,203
...and got dizzy from overwork,
and fainted in your bed?

1354
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,323
It's not the maid.

1355
01:23:55,409 --> 01:23:59,880
Then I'm very anxious
to hear who it is, Marvin.

1356
01:24:01,289 --> 01:24:04,201
I can't wait to hear
what you have to say next.

1357
01:24:04,809 --> 01:24:06,481
I'm waiting, Marvin.

1358
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:08,687
I'm waiting, too.

1359
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:10,965
You know what my guess is?

1360
01:24:11,569 --> 01:24:14,322
My guess is that
that's a woman in your bed.

1361
01:24:14,569 --> 01:24:16,048
That's my guess, too, Millie.

1362
01:24:16,129 --> 01:24:19,644
What woman, you can tell me in court.

1363
01:24:23,009 --> 01:24:24,920
I'm leaving now, Marvin.

1364
01:24:25,889 --> 01:24:28,926
Before I go,
I want to ask you one silly question.

1365
01:24:29,809 --> 01:24:31,561
Why doesn't she move?

1366
01:24:32,849 --> 01:24:33,964
I can explain that.

1367
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:37,086
Don't tell me you've been carrying on
with a helpless paralytic.

1368
01:24:37,169 --> 01:24:38,966
I won't buy it, Marvin.

1369
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:43,088
She drank a whole bottle of tequila
by herself.

1370
01:24:43,169 --> 01:24:48,038
Set and match point coming up. Watch it.

1371
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,881
Like I watched the gauge?

1372
01:24:56,369 --> 01:24:58,121
- It's mine.
- Look out.

1373
01:25:00,329 --> 01:25:03,002
- Lob it!
- I got it.

1374
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:06,768
Watch it.

1375
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:20,766
It's broken.
Oh, God, it's broken. I can feel it.

1376
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,521
It's not broken, it's sprained.

1377
01:25:22,609 --> 01:25:24,008
You're a nose and throat man,
how do you know?

1378
01:25:25,809 --> 01:25:27,800
We were dead drunk, the both of us.

1379
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:30,244
You think I'd do something
like that stone sober?

1380
01:25:30,329 --> 01:25:33,799
Let me tell you something else.
Being cruel to the children is Number 2.

1381
01:25:33,889 --> 01:25:35,481
That's Number 1.

1382
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:36,763
To you, Millie.

1383
01:25:36,849 --> 01:25:38,840
I can understand it being important to you.

1384
01:25:38,929 --> 01:25:40,920
- To me, it was meaningless.
- That's a shame.

1385
01:25:41,009 --> 01:25:43,204
I always get upset
when you don't have a good time.

1386
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:44,927
Good. Get it out.

1387
01:25:45,009 --> 01:25:48,126
The quicker you get it out,
the quicker you'll be rid of it.

1388
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:49,198
God.

1389
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:51,042
What do I do now?

1390
01:25:51,129 --> 01:25:53,324
Do you expect me
to go to the bar mitzvah...

1391
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:57,038
...and say congratulations to the man
who paid that woman to sleep with you?

1392
01:25:57,129 --> 01:25:59,802
- He'll probably wink at you.
- He doesn't know you know.

1393
01:25:59,889 --> 01:26:01,402
I see. Then the joke's on him.

1394
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:03,605
- Only you and I know that I know.
- You're right.

1395
01:26:03,689 --> 01:26:06,249
You don't deserve that treatment.
Forget the bar mitzvah.

1396
01:26:06,329 --> 01:26:09,241
- I'll go back with you on the next plane.
- No.

1397
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:12,241
I will not give you or your family
that satisfaction.

1398
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:15,679
I am going to behave with more dignity
than you ever dreamed.

1399
01:26:15,769 --> 01:26:18,761
I'm going to that bar mitzvah
with my head held high.

1400
01:26:18,929 --> 01:26:22,285
I am not going to divorce you.
I am going to forgive you.

1401
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:26,088
I am going to forget this ever happened.

1402
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:29,249
I'm going to figure out why it happened...

1403
01:26:29,329 --> 01:26:33,004
...and I'm never going to bring it up again
as long as I live.

1404
01:26:33,809 --> 01:26:36,846
Now, I'm going in there...

1405
01:26:37,049 --> 01:26:40,246
...and I'm going to spend
every last cent you have.

1406
01:26:43,649 --> 01:26:46,721
Here we go, dear. Here we go.
To the right, to the right.

1407
01:26:46,809 --> 01:26:49,562
- I feel like a piano, a dead piano.
- All right.

1408
01:26:49,649 --> 01:26:52,402
Please get a wet towel
out of our bathroom.

1409
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:55,604
You mean this is all your room?

1410
01:26:58,169 --> 01:27:00,967
I slept standing up
and you're living like royalty?

1411
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:04,724
The Queen is about to abdicate her leg
if we don't get her into bed.

1412
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:08,639
I want you to see what they got.

1413
01:27:09,729 --> 01:27:11,560
What happened, damn it?

1414
01:27:12,849 --> 01:27:14,999
I broke a bottle of perfume.
I'm sorry, Bett.

1415
01:27:15,089 --> 01:27:17,364
Don't worry about it.
It was only $90 an ounce.

1416
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:21,237
- Of all the stupid ass things to do.
- Hold on. She did not do it on purpose.

1417
01:27:21,329 --> 01:27:24,526
- You mean it was a planned accident?
- We don't have to take this crap.

1418
01:27:24,609 --> 01:27:28,284
We can go up to our small cigar box
and watch our broken television.

1419
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:31,839
I cut my finger. It's bleeding.

1420
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:35,486
- Damn, that perfume burns.
- Only good perfume.

1421
01:27:35,569 --> 01:27:37,560
Cheap perfume you can't feel at all.

1422
01:27:37,649 --> 01:27:40,163
Bett, there's broken glass
on the bathroom floor.

1423
01:27:40,249 --> 01:27:42,604
- Be careful where you step.
- I'm glad you told me.

1424
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:45,123
I was going to walk in there a lot today.

1425
01:27:45,329 --> 01:27:49,402
- Do you have any Band-Aids?
- We'll take care of one casualty at a time.

1426
01:27:50,609 --> 01:27:51,803
Grab her!

1427
01:27:56,249 --> 01:27:57,841
Oh, my leg!

1428
01:27:58,329 --> 01:28:02,208
- Will you please help us?
- Now you want my help?

1429
01:28:05,449 --> 01:28:06,928
Watch the step.

1430
01:28:09,089 --> 01:28:12,365
- Help me! Help me, somebody.
- What's the matter?

1431
01:28:12,449 --> 01:28:13,564
My head.

1432
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:15,605
I banged my head on the medicine cabinet.

1433
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:16,917
I'm going to pass out.

1434
01:28:17,009 --> 01:28:18,681
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

1435
01:28:18,769 --> 01:28:21,488
- You're not going to pass...
- I'm passing out.

1436
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:25,161
My God, would you get me a wet towel?
She passed out.

1437
01:28:25,489 --> 01:28:27,878
Sweetheart, you're going to be all right.

1438
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,722
Don't lie to the woman.
She knows she's not okay.

1439
01:28:33,769 --> 01:28:36,920
You're bleeding on the man's rug.
He'll charge me for it.

1440
01:28:39,089 --> 01:28:40,522
Listen to me.

1441
01:28:41,969 --> 01:28:44,119
How many fingers?

1442
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:50,680
I just stepped on a broken piece of glass
and I hope you're satisfied.

1443
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:55,763
- That feel better?
- No, that's the wrong ankle.

1444
01:28:55,849 --> 01:28:58,044
Would you help me
lift her to the bed, please?

1445
01:28:58,129 --> 01:29:01,201
- This only happens on vacations.
- Grab her feet.

1446
01:29:03,369 --> 01:29:05,599
God, it's like Guadalcanal in here.

1447
01:29:05,689 --> 01:29:06,644
Easy.

1448
01:29:09,049 --> 01:29:10,004
Careful.

1449
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:13,082
Wait a minute.

1450
01:29:18,169 --> 01:29:20,444
This bed is bigger than our whole room.

1451
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,525
- Let's settle up.
- What?

1452
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:25,486
How much do I owe you?

1453
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,807
Because after I pay you,
I am not going to see you.

1454
01:29:30,129 --> 01:29:31,642
All right. All right.

1455
01:29:31,729 --> 01:29:33,765
Let's not get our noses bent out of shape.

1456
01:29:33,849 --> 01:29:35,760
It's all over, let's forget it.

1457
01:29:35,849 --> 01:29:37,168
- Forget it?
- Forget it.

1458
01:29:37,249 --> 01:29:40,605
Forget the year I planned for this vacation?
What do I got to show for it?

1459
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:42,281
An overdose of Japanese food...

1460
01:29:42,369 --> 01:29:45,247
...mildew in my feet
from sleeping in a wet bed...

1461
01:29:45,329 --> 01:29:48,878
...a wife with a concussion,
two lawsuits for two car crashes...

1462
01:29:49,169 --> 01:29:52,844
...that I didn't drive two times
and you want me to forget it?

1463
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:55,367
I'm writing a blank check.

1464
01:29:55,529 --> 01:29:59,317
- You fill it out and shove it up your...
- No!

1465
01:30:00,209 --> 01:30:03,360
You don't use that language
in front of the ladies.

1466
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:06,442
The ladies are unconscious.
They can't hear us.

1467
01:30:06,529 --> 01:30:10,124
Now, I owe you for a bottle of perfume,
blood stains on the rug...

1468
01:30:10,809 --> 01:30:13,801
...an acetylene torch
that burned us out of the car.

1469
01:30:13,889 --> 01:30:17,643
I've had it. I want to go home.

1470
01:30:18,529 --> 01:30:19,564
I need a vacation.

1471
01:30:19,649 --> 01:30:21,321
Come on, buddy. Look, let's shake.

1472
01:30:21,409 --> 01:30:24,082
Let's shake
and let's forget it ever happened.

1473
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:26,764
Shake hands with the man, please.

1474
01:30:27,329 --> 01:30:30,207
- Watch what you're doing, idiot!
- Idiot?

1475
01:30:30,529 --> 01:30:33,327
That's the hump
that broke the camel's back.

1476
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:37,368
Either you apologise
to my dear, sweet wife...

1477
01:30:37,449 --> 01:30:41,647
...for calling her an idiot, or I'll take
this Japanese aluminium racket...

1478
01:30:41,729 --> 01:30:44,721
...and I'll backhand you to death.
- Don't threaten me.

1479
01:30:44,809 --> 01:30:46,800
Never threaten a man
who's spent two years...

1480
01:30:46,889 --> 01:30:49,323
...working the drunk ward. Now back off!

1481
01:30:50,329 --> 01:30:52,684
Apologise to my wife
by the time I count to five...

1482
01:30:52,769 --> 01:30:55,408
...or I'm going to start
serving with your big head.

1483
01:30:55,489 --> 01:30:58,242
- One...
- Don't fight. Please don't fight.

1484
01:30:58,329 --> 01:30:59,045
Two.

1485
01:30:59,129 --> 01:31:01,484
- Somebody will get hurt and fall on me.
- Three.

1486
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:04,129
Don't hit him with the racket,
I just had it restrung.

1487
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,882
Four, and you know what comes after four,
don't you?

1488
01:31:06,969 --> 01:31:10,325
I'll mess you up so bad
even I won't be able to fix you up.

1489
01:31:10,809 --> 01:31:12,720
Apologise before I get to five.

1490
01:31:15,609 --> 01:31:17,884
Say it. Go ahead, say it.

1491
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:22,079
Say it. Are you afraid to say it?

1492
01:31:22,169 --> 01:31:24,319
Say five! Five! I'll say it for you.

1493
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:27,003
Five! Say it!

1494
01:31:27,489 --> 01:31:30,799
It don't count unless I say it. Five!

1495
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:48,006
Thank God their patients
aren't here to see this.

1496
01:31:57,729 --> 01:32:00,880
- Millie!
- No word from Sleeping Beauty?

1497
01:32:02,009 --> 01:32:04,398
Thanks, thank you very much.
Forget about her.

1498
01:32:04,489 --> 01:32:07,799
We'll dress, go to the bar mitzvah
and tonight, move to another hotel.

1499
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:09,208
May we do that, Millie?

1500
01:32:09,289 --> 01:32:12,645
I wonder if Harry spent as much on her
as we did on his lousy kid.

1501
01:32:12,729 --> 01:32:16,358
Millie, I'll never do anything again
to hurt you as long as I live.

1502
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:20,363
You're the most special woman
in the world to me, Millie, and I love you.

1503
01:32:20,449 --> 01:32:23,998
- I love you, Millie.
- Please, not in front of the hooker.

1504
01:32:25,809 --> 01:32:27,527
God, get him off of me!

1505
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:30,681
- Don't bite, you'll ruin your caps.
- Get him off of me!

1506
01:32:30,769 --> 01:32:32,282
I've had enough.

1507
01:32:33,329 --> 01:32:35,206
Don't you ever bite me again.

1508
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:37,723
Do you know you
could give me a blood disease!

1509
01:32:37,809 --> 01:32:39,845
Now, tell me we're friends.

1510
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:43,968
- Say that you enjoyed the vacation.
- Friends!

1511
01:32:44,329 --> 01:32:47,366
Say it! You're going to tell me...

1512
01:32:47,489 --> 01:32:49,445
...that you enjoyed...
- Friends!

1513
01:32:50,089 --> 01:32:51,920
- Now!
- Friends!

1514
01:32:52,169 --> 01:32:55,718
You tell me that you enjoyed
being with us on our vacation.

1515
01:32:55,809 --> 01:33:00,041
- Best time I've ever had.
- You better believe it.

1516
01:33:05,289 --> 01:33:09,487
- Call your wife off.
- Get off, get off!

1517
01:33:13,569 --> 01:33:17,926
Did you love the Japanese restaurant?
Say it!

1518
01:33:20,809 --> 01:33:24,438
And you say that you're going to love...

1519
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:28,568
...going with us next year
on a vacation again, all right?

1520
01:33:28,649 --> 01:33:31,322
You can crack my ribs, but I won't say it.

1521
01:33:40,129 --> 01:33:42,768
- Do you like it?
- Mildred, you look beautiful.

1522
01:33:43,089 --> 01:33:44,681
- Yeah?
- Beautiful.

1523
01:33:45,169 --> 01:33:46,238
Thank you.

1524
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:49,207
Come on, darling, there's a cab waiting.
20 minutes.

1525
01:33:49,409 --> 01:33:51,718
- What happened to our roommate?
- She's gone.

1526
01:33:51,809 --> 01:33:53,640
She lost her shoes, so I gave her yours.

1527
01:33:53,729 --> 01:33:55,720
Anything to get rid of her.

1528
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:58,998
What are you doing?
You're giving away my cab.

1529
01:33:59,089 --> 01:34:00,920
I said to hold it. What's wrong with you?

1530
01:34:01,009 --> 01:34:02,761
I'm sorry, I couldn't hold it any longer.

1531
01:34:02,849 --> 01:34:05,443
For crying out...
Would you get me another one, please?

1532
01:34:05,529 --> 01:34:06,678
Lt'll take about 20 minutes.

1533
01:34:06,769 --> 01:34:08,680
I knew it. We're going to be late.

1534
01:34:08,769 --> 01:34:09,838
Hi.

1535
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:14,202
Can I give you a lift?

1536
01:34:14,289 --> 01:34:16,245
No, thank you. We'll wait.

1537
01:34:16,529 --> 01:34:19,601
That's very nice of you.
Get in the cab, Marvin.

1538
01:34:19,689 --> 01:34:22,362
- Are you serious?
- I didn't come 3,000 miles to be late.

1539
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:25,009
- Get in the cab, Marvin.
- Do you know who that is?

1540
01:34:25,089 --> 01:34:28,126
Yes, it's our hooker.
You think I'd ride with strangers?

1541
01:34:28,969 --> 01:34:31,847
- This is very nice of you. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1542
01:34:31,929 --> 01:34:33,521
- Nice shoes.
- Thank you.

1543
01:34:33,609 --> 01:34:35,008
- Live out here?
- Sometimes.

1544
01:34:36,049 --> 01:34:38,279
Passengers holding a blue boarding pass...

1545
01:34:38,409 --> 01:34:42,163
...may enter the aircraft through gate 37-A.
Thank you.

1546
01:34:43,049 --> 01:34:44,198
Mother!

1547
01:34:45,809 --> 01:34:49,085
- I was afraid I wouldn't make it.
- What are you doing here?

1548
01:34:49,249 --> 01:34:50,921
Where's your father?

1549
01:34:51,369 --> 01:34:53,929
My God,
was it the lima beans and broccoli?

1550
01:34:54,129 --> 01:34:56,882
No, no. He's waiting outside in the car.

1551
01:34:56,969 --> 01:35:00,279
I just wanted to say good-bye
and thank you.

1552
01:35:01,649 --> 01:35:02,923
And I love you.

1553
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:11,763
You don't know what this means to me.
I've been depressed.

1554
01:35:11,849 --> 01:35:14,409
I just found out
I've already seen the movie.

1555
01:35:17,889 --> 01:35:21,120
I'm going to miss you, Mother,
but I know I'm doing the...

1556
01:35:21,209 --> 01:35:23,928
No, Jenny, don't say it. It's all right.

1557
01:35:24,209 --> 01:35:27,121
I'm doing the right thing.
There, I said it anyways.

1558
01:35:27,489 --> 01:35:28,808
This is for you.

1559
01:35:31,089 --> 01:35:34,047
- What is that?
- It's a map of the movie stars' homes.

1560
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:37,082
Just in case you ever
make it out this way again.

1561
01:35:46,569 --> 01:35:49,242
- I'm sorry about dropping that suitcase.
- That's all right.

1562
01:35:49,329 --> 01:35:51,160
It wasn't the foot with the glass in it.

1563
01:35:51,249 --> 01:35:53,717
I must be seated
with my good eye near the window.

1564
01:35:53,809 --> 01:35:56,118
I don't want to miss
the Grand Canyon again.

1565
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:58,769
How can I lecture and operate on Monday?

1566
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:01,563
I can't speak and I can't look down.

1567
01:36:05,929 --> 01:36:07,647
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1568
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:10,004
Welcome aboard Flight 211
to New York and London.

1569
01:36:10,089 --> 01:36:13,445
Οur flying time this afternoon
will be four hours and fifty minutes...

1570
01:36:13,529 --> 01:36:16,362
...and we'll be cruising at an altitude
of 37,000 feet.

1571
01:36:16,449 --> 01:36:18,838
We'll now be serving you
cocktails and beverages...

1572
01:36:18,929 --> 01:36:22,046
...and then serving lunch,
followed by our film, No Left Turns...

1573
01:36:22,129 --> 01:36:24,689
...starring James Coburn and Diana Barrie.

1574
01:36:25,209 --> 01:36:26,847
Christ, Sidney, let's get off.

1575
01:36:26,929 --> 01:36:29,648
Tell them to let us off this bloody plane!
