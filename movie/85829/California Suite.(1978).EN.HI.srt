Oh, don't make such a fuss.

I'm lucky I can keep it up.
I told you, I never flew before.

You're a first-class lunatic!...

Our relationship has

Yes, but you do love me,
Don't you, Harold?

I know this is an awkward time
To bring it up,

But I must know
For our future.

It's over.

25
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:30,258
I was listening to
Beethoven's ninth.

26
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:33,682
Somewhere on this plane
There's a wonderful orchestra...

The cameraman must do
Luggage commercials. ...

All you could see
Were the bags under my eyes.

We'll be landing in Los Angeles

I suppose we must.

And I finally get nominated
For a nauseating little comedy.

That's why
They call it Hollywood.

Gorgeous color.
The smog.

I wonder if
They sell it in bottles.

44
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:19,129
It would make A wonderful present

For the folks back home.

We go home in a station wagon...

A pot of tea,

65
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,691
I think we're in big trouble.
I didn't build the car.

66
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:18,705
I just drove it.

67
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,866
Did you look at the gauge
Like I told you to?

68
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:25,235
I looked at the gauge
More than I looked at the road.

69
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,155
I ran off the road.
I did not run off the gauge.

70
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,362
But if you looked at the gauge,
It wouldn't have overheated.

71
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,997
You mean
Lookin' at the gauge real good

Stops it from overheatin'?

73

No, but you've got to speak up.

74
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:36,004
You've got to say,
"hey, the gauge says

75
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,834
We're overheating."

76
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,027
This is not the kind of news
That you keep to yourself.

You know, I hate rent-a-cars.
Why don't we just

Leave it here?

00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:43,082
It's cooling off, see?
I told you. All we needed

80
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,227
To do was give it a chance.

81
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,803

With the doors?

Didn't the man say
Not to slam the hood down?...

85

Didn't the man say the doors
Sometimes lock when

86

You slam the hood down?

I would burn my hand?

It's locked, all right.
Who's got the keys?

From my seat to the hood.

- that fool closed the windows.

I saw that fool

Close the windows.

Doesn't work with open windows.

00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:30,625
Bob, I don't want
To call in a lawyer

162
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,354
Until I see how it goes.

163
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,711
When have you known me
To be intimidated?

164
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,442
That doesn't count.

165
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,532
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I remember it in detail.

166
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,390
Bob, can you save
The erotic conversation until

167
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,769
It can do us both some good?

168
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,039
Yes. Yes, I will.
I'll call you

169
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:57,053
As soon as he leaves.

170
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:59,666
I do too. Bye.

171
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:01,102
[ hangs up phone ]</i></i>

172
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:01,890
beautiful day, huh? </i>...</i>

173
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,641
For a change.

174
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,498
Hello, Hannah. 

175
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,234
you were supposed to knock. </i></i>
I was going to keep you</i>...</i>

176
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,123
waiting in the hall. </i>...</i>

177
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,058
You screwed up
My big moment.

178
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,978
You still have trouble
Saying a simple "hello."

179
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,122
Oh, I am sorry.

180
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:30,418
You always did get a thrill out
Of the little things in life. ...

181
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:32,432
Hello, bill. ...

182
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,352
Hello, Hannah.

183
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:37,672
how are you?
- at this moment,

184
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:39,330
I'm completely nonplussed.

185
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:41,695
What the hell have you done
To yourself? You've turned

186
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,722
Into a young boy again.

187
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:45,042
It's good to see you.
I mean it.

188
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:48,754
You look like the sweetest,
Young, 14-year-old boy.

189
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,186
You're not spending
Your summers at camp, are you?...

190
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,554
Just three weeks
In July. 

191
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,474
Shouldn't we kiss or
Shake hands or something?...

192
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,587
Let's save it
For when you leave.

193
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,330
I made a 1:30 reservation
For lunch.

194
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:03,010
Is that all right?

195
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:05,586
Just, uh, give me a minute.

196
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:08,873
When you haven't seen
Your ex-husband in nine years,

197
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,562
Your eyes have to... Adjust.

198
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:12,818
I love Your California clothes.

199
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:15,281
They're Bloomingdales
Of New York. 

200
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:18,914
It's the best place
For California clothes...

201
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,937
My god,
You look so-- ...

202
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,331
I don't know.
What is the word

203
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:24,098
I'm looking for?

204
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:27,634
Happy.
Casual...

205
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,827
You never know out here.
Are you dressed up now,

206
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:31,971
Or is that sporty?

207
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,002
I didn't think a tie
Was necessary for a reunion.

208
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:36,593
Is that what this is?

209
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:39,007
When you walked in like that,
I thought we were

210
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,003
Gonna play tennis.

211
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,161
You certainly look
Fit enough for it...

212
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:44,626
"fit." You think I look fit?

213
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:46,546
You awful shit.
I look gorgeous.  

214
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,402
Yes, you do, Hannah. ...

215
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:51,442
Your tan, of course,
Is perfect.  

216
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,915
I always wondered how
You got the back

217
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,234
Of your ears so dark.

218
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,069
You put the top Of your car down

219
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,722
And drive away from the sun.

220
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,679
Look, if we're gonna
Banter like this,

221
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:01,827
Give me a little time.

222
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,177
After nine years,
I'm a little rusty.

223
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:05,873
Oh, you'll pick it Right up again.

224
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:06,722
It's like French.

225
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:09,429
You see, that's what I壇 miss
If I ever left New York--

226
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:10,210
The bantering.

227
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:12,562
San Francisco痴
Only an hour away...

228
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:14,482
We go up there
And banter in emergencies.

229
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,882
I never liked San Francisco.
I was always afraid...

230
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:20,050
I'd fall out of bed and
Roll down one of those hills. ...

231
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:23,325
Not you, Hannah.
You roll up hills.

232
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,962
Oh, good.
You're bantering. 

233
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:28,882
The flight out
Wasn't a total loss.

234
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:31,668
I detect a bit of snip
In the air.

235
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,856
Does that mean
Your conversation with jenny

236
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:36,162
Wasn't all that successful?

237
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:37,692
Oh, I don't know.
I thought that we glared

238
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:38,658
At each other rather well.

239
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:41,089
I ordered a drink before lunch.
I thought one of us

240
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:42,338
Might be a little nervous.

241
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,313
I gave up
Double scotches on the rocks

242
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,058
Six years ago.

243
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:47,826
I'm big on apple juice
These days.  

244
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:51,916
Well, I guess I知 the one
That's nervous. 

245
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:58,658
It's obvious this place
Agrees with you, bill...

246
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:01,202
Or do they call you Billy?...

247
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:02,431
That's right.
Jenny told me.

248
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:03,618
Everybody calls you Billy.

249
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:07,382
That's me-- Billy.
it's just adorable. </i>...</i>

250
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,521
Forty-four-year-old Billy
Standing there...

251
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:12,796
In his cute little sneakers
And sweater.

252
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:18,333
You'd better sit down, Billy.
You're making me feel like

253
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,938
Your math teacher.

254
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,731
I promised myself driving
Over here I would be pleasant.

255
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:24,002
I am now being pleasant.

256
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:27,448
You drive everywhere, do you?
Even to your car?

257
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:28,354
Everywhere.

258
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,482
If we're going,
I think we'd better get started.

259
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,374
You have changed, Billy.
You know, you don't get rattled

260
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,689
As easily as you used to.

261
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:37,170
Well, they don't have
As many rattlers out here.

262
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:41,667
Maybe this lunch won't be
As dull as I thought.

263
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:53,569
Marvin!
Hey, Marvin!  

264
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,925
Harry!
[ laughing ]

265
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:57,330
Hey!

266
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,344
Hey, boy!

267
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:02,177
Harry.  

268
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:09,553
You-you got so bald.
How did you get so bald?

269
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,194
You don't see your brother
In five years,

270
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,226
That's all you gotta say?

271
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:14,132
I didn't even know It was you,

272
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,234
You got so bald.

273
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,559
Where's Millie?
She's coming in

274
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:19,234
On the morning plane.

275
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,417
We don't like to fly together
On account of the kids.

276
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,978
You got so bald!

277
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:28,145
Hey, Marvin, take a gander.

278
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:30,525
Hmm? Oh, I壇 give up
Two years of my life for

279
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,002
One hour with each of them.

280
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:34,665
[ Marvin ]
You still haven't changed,

281
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:35,490
Have you?

282
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:37,714
Let's say "hello."
Let's see how far we can get.

283
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,402
Hey, don't start in
With me, harry.

284
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:41,947
I'm here one night Without Millie.

285
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:43,170
Don't get me into trouble.

286
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:45,005
Would I do that to you?
You did it to papa

287
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,210
When he was 82 years old.

288
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:49,138
Don't do it to me. 

289
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,157
Oh, miss? You-- Stop already

290
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,162
With the girls!

291
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,025
Your kid is getting
Bar Mitzvahed tomorrow...

292
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:58,030
Hey, stop it. What is this,
A jogging outfit?

293
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,746
That's what we do here.

294
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,001
[ Hannah ]
Jenny tells me you've moved.

295
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:03,705
You're not in
Hardy canyon anymore.

296
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,066
Laurel.

297
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:06,445
Laurel canyon.
Laurel, hardy,

298
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,570
What the hell.

299
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,970
She says it's sort of
A small French farmhouse...

300
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,890
With a little water mill
In back...

301
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,817
And the sweetest
Little tennis court.

302
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,498
That's right.

303
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:17,688
Sounds awfully rugged.
Well, we're from pioneer stock

304
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:18,946
Out here in the west.

305
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,497
There's a glass house
Two blocks down the road if you

306
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:23,106
Want to throw some more stones.

307
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,041
Maybe I値l just drop something
From the plane...

308
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,097
When I leave tonight...
With jenny.

309
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:34,641
This is very familiar.
Yeah.

310
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:38,806
The house we rented
The year before jenny was born

311
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:41,184
Is just down the road there.

312
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,017
That wasn't a bad summer,
Was it?

313
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:46,930
I thought it was terrific.
[ sighs ] ...

314
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:51,427
Yes, well, the pacific ocean
Was a lot more interesting

315
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,415
In those days.

316
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:55,614
[ bill ] No, thank you.

317
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,930
No cigarettes either?

318
00:15:57,026 --> 00:15:58,897
No, I gave them up
Eight years ago.

319
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,202
Don't you miss the coughing
And the hacking

320
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:02,050
In the morning?

321
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:06,002
It woke the dogs up.
I have dogs now.

322
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,054
Isn't divorce wonderful?

323
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:13,066
You have changed, Billy.
You've gone clean on me.

324
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,137
Tell me, what else do you do
To keep that winsome

325
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,434
Adolescent look?

326
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,377
You're just dying
To make a little fun of me,

327
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:20,930
Aren't you?

328
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:23,314
No, I don't mind.
I have an hour to kill.

329
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,096
Would you believe I, uh,
I run five miles

330
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:25,858
Every morning?

331
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:27,070
After what?
Oh.

332
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,153
After a good night's sleep.

333
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,141
I don't even have a pill
In my medicine cabinet,

334
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:32,162
And I gave up analysis.

335
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,487
Oh, I heard that.
Why did you quit?

336
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,330
I went sane.

337
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:38,048
Sane? My god.
How boring.

338
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:41,585
Tell me something, Billy,
Don't you ever get depressed?...

339
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:44,338
Yes.
When?...

340
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,753
Now.

341
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:51,793
And I, uh, I hear
You went in for an operation. ...

342
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:54,610
A hysterectomy.
It was nothing...

343

I have them every year...

344
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,889
I understood you had,
Uh, prostate trouble.

345
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,841
Small world, isn't it?  

346
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,515
Well, our past sins Do have a way

347
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:04,706
Of catching up with us.

348
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:07,153
Jenny tells me
You have a new boyfriend. 

349
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,287
[ chuckles ] No. 

350
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,560
I have a lover.
Jenny has boyfriends.

351

Asthma,
Leans toward alcoholism.

He also has the second-best mind
I've met in this country

Since Adlai Stevenson.

359

What's with you mate-wise?...

360

"mate-wise"?

Mate-wise, I知 seeing

Are you? Where are
You seeing her to?

Come on, Hannah.  

364
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:49,137
I beg your pardon.
Have I offended you?

365

My god, it's a long time
Since I致e been involved

366
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:53,154
In a smart-ass conversation.

367
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,242
I'm sorry,
But you're the one

368
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:55,074
That said things like,

369
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,692
"I hear you have a boyfriend,"
And "I知 seeing

370

A very nice girl."

I'm not the one with
The Bobsey twin haircut

And the peter pan phraseology.

I can see you've really come
To hunt bear, haven't you?

00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,415
Hunt bear?...

375
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,977
Is that what you said?
"hunt bear"?

376
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:10,897
Is that the kind of nifty
Conversation you have...

377
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:14,690
Around the campfires out here
In the rugged west?

378
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:16,721
Can we talk about jenny? 

379
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,641
What's your rush?
She's only 17.

380
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:21,169
She has her whole life
Ahead of her.

381

If I知 gonna turn my daughter
Over to you, which I am not, ...

At least I wanna know
What you're like.

Jenny is our</i> daughter.</i>
Ours.

384
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,161
Maybe. We'll see.

They've been a little slow
With the blood test.

Five million cigarettes...

[ panting ] Oh! 

389
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,523
When you were younger,
You were the healthiest girl

390
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:42,466
I knew. What happened?

391
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:47,010
With Nixon in the White House,
Good health seemed to be

392
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,024
In bad taste.

393
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:53,276
Your friend's about
A size too small for me. 

394
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,858
How does she fit you?

395
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:57,872
Nicely, thank you.

00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:00,742
Is this the neophyte actress
With the golden hair

Jenny's been telling me about?

398

Am I being too nosy?
Not for a Newsweek</i> editor.</i>

399
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,073
Yes, she is, and she's
A damned good actress.

00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,249
Married before;
Has a nine-year-old boy. 

401

Really? Should make
A nice pet for jenny. ...

402
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:18,993
Is marriage contemplated?

403
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,906
It's contemplated.
It's being discussed

404
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,242
And seriously considered.

405
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,626
And we all get along
Like clams.

406
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:27,086
Right. And would there
Be room for all of you in

407
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:28,610
The little French farmhouse?

408
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:31,613
Or will you have to take them
To a Moroccan villa

409
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:33,089
On Wilshire boulevard?

410
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:36,273
What the hell
Are you so bitter about?

411
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:38,355
You used to be bright and witty,
And now you're just

412
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,201
Snide and sarcastic.

413
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:41,152
It comes with age.
When you don't have

414
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,146
A fastball anymore,

415
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,850
You go to
Change-ups and sliders.

416
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:51,815
Can we go?
I feel like we're playing

417
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,804
From here to eternity.

418
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:05,984
Pretty girl.
I think so.

419
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:09,313
I suppose if jenny stays,
She'll grow up

420
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,242
To look like that--

421
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:14,161
Blonde hair, blonde teeth,
Blonde life. 

422

God, I can just hear
The quips flying...

423
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:18,494
When you and
The second-best mind since

424
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,194
Adlai Stevenson get together.

425

Under a blanket at

The polish players.

Your mind clicks off
Bric-a-brac so goddamn fast...

It never has a chance for
An honest emotion or thought

Ever to get through.

And you're so filled
With honest emotion, ...

433
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:38,961
You fall in love every time
Someone sings a ballad.

434
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:41,852
You're worse
Than a hopeless romantic.

435

You're a hopeful one.

436

You're the kind of man who would
End the world famine problem

By having them all eat out,

Preferably at a good
Chinese restaurant.

Let's stop this crap.

Is because jenny ran away...

Or because she ran away
To somebody whose lifestyle...

To come home with me.

00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,882
On Gucci pants...

477
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:22,193
So they could raise 2,000
For the grape pickers.

478
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,283
Why the hell didn't they just
Mail them the pants?

479
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:30,929
You were terrific when
You used to write like that.

480
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:34,902
I haven't seen your newest film.
I'm told it grossed very well

481
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:36,194
In backward areas.

482
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,353
Jesus. Was I anything
Like you before?

483
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:40,689
I couldn't hold a candle to you.

484
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:41,992
No wonder
Nobody here talked to me

485
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:42,817
For the first two years.

486
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:44,831
Lucky you.

00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:48,565
Look, we have
To settle this today.

488

If you respect jenny
As a person, then respect

489
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:52,321
Her right to make a free choice.

490
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,801
You get her for the summers.
That's enough.

491
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:56,623
It takes me the other
Ten months of the year to get

492
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,762
The seaweed out of her brains.

493
00:22:57,858 --> 00:23:00,753
How much time do you
Spend with her? 

494
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,162
How often do you have
Breakfast with her? ...

495
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:08,415
How many nights a week
Does she eat dinner alone?...

496
00:23:08,897 --> 00:23:10,447
You really think she's
Happy with that $20 bill

497
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,009
You give her...

498
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:13,877
Every time you go off
To Washington

For the weekend?

The girl is growing up
Lonely, Hannah,  

501
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:22,412
And she's flown out here
On her own savings

502
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:23,649
To prove it to you.

503
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:25,586
She has two dogs,
A Dominican cook,

504
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:28,138
And every good-looking boy
In the senior class

505
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,570
Living off my refrigerator.

506
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:32,861
Despite her gothic reports,
She is not living

507
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:34,497
The life of Jane Eyre.

508
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:36,913
Would you like to know what
Jenny has to say about you?

509
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:39,441
She told me. She thinks
I'm a son of a bitch.

510
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:42,961
She also thinks
I'm a funny son of a bitch.

511
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:44,448
She loves me,
But she doesn't like me.

512
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:45,249
She's afraid of me.

513
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:47,921
She's intimidated by me.
She respects me,

514
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,481
But she doesn't wanna
Become like me.

515
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,945
We have a perfectly normal
Mother-daughter relationship. ...

516
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,897
How the hell
Can you be so flippant... ...

517
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:57,456
When it comes to your
Own daughter's well-being?

518
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:59,376
And how the hell
Can you be so pompous...

519
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:02,443
Not to recognize a perfectly
Normal, rebellious attitude

520
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:03,361
In a young girl?

521
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:06,549
If she didn't complain,
I'd probably send her

522
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,321
To an expensive shrink.

523
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,257
Since she's with me
Ten months of the year,

524
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:12,236
It is only normal You're the one

525
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:13,569
She's going to miss.

526
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:16,529
I think by and large she and I
Have managed quite well.

527
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,857
But like all young girls,
She needs a father image.

528
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,113
I don't mind.
If it's only July and august,

00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,457
It might as well be you.

530
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,033
This is April,
And she came out

531
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,337
Without your permission.

532
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,753
She never had
A good head for dates.

533
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:30,897
What would you do if
I just keep her here with me?

534
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:32,634
I will call my friend,
The attorney general

535

Of the united states,

If she's not on
The 9:00 plane tonight.

537
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:38,577
Why didn't you ever run
For office, Hannah?

538
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:42,689
I always thought you'd have made
A hell of a governor.

00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,606

Offer me a monarchy,
And we'll talk.

You know if we leave it
Up to jenny, you don't

Certainly.

Why else would the ninny
Run away?

Who said
We don't have problems?

552
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:16,962
She is 17 years old,

553
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,429
And when we go at each other,
She needs another shoulder

554
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:21,057
To cry on.

It's the first time in my life
I've ever seen you so nervous...

I'm not nervous.

I'm scared to death.

That's good of you
To admit it. 

562

But honesty always was
One of your strengths.

You're pretty cute yourself.

And lima beans.

- she likes them?
- she hates them. 

792
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:57,791
But from now on,
What do I care?

793
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:01,622
Good-bye, Hannah.
It was very good

794
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:02,609
Seeing you again.

795
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:05,888
I feel like a--
Like an artist...

That she doesn't want to sell...

797
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:11,040
I'll frame it and keep it
In a good light.

798

What do you mean,
Just one room?

There are two reservations.

Dr. And Mrs. Chauncey Gump.

I have here one deluxe room,
Double bed,

For dr. And Mrs. Panama
On the 3rd, 4th and 5th.

I have nothing
For a dr. Gump.

808
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,376
There must be a clerical error
Or an omission of intelligence,

809
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:27,713
Because my travel agent
Made the reservation.

810
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:30,361
Now, he's my wife's brother,
And he's also my patient.

I wish you'd double-check it.

812

I already double-checked
Our files.

Here's the telegram we received.
You can see for yourself.

Yes, I can see that my name
Is missing from this wire.

But as you can see,
I'm not missing

Now, there's four of us,
And we need two rooms.

I don't have Two rooms available.

I'm sorry.

It's academy award week.
We don't care who wins.

However, there is
Some repair going on.

It's not terribly comfortable,
But I can squeeze

A small daybed in.

826
00:39:57,552 --> 00:40:00,105
I'm sorry, but it's
The best I can do.

Well, what do we do?

828
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,494
I'm not gonna stand
Around here with whiplash

And argue with the man.

I'm gonna check in
To the Hilton. Let's go, baby...

Well, it's our last few days
Of vacation. I'd hate

For us not to be together.

833
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:12,365
What do you mean,
"not be together"? We're all

Gonna check into the Hilton.

Set on staying here.

It's so pretty here, Chauncey.

Oh, listen. Listen.
What?

843
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:29,728
Even a tiny room in this place
Couldn't be too bad.

I don't wanna see any blood
In this hotel lobby.

Now, either we toss
For the room, goddamn it,

Or we toss for the room.

00:44:15,808 --> 00:44:17,760
David Niven could have
Accepted for me.

946
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:20,010
He'd have been bright and witty,
And no one would've

947
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:20,817
Noticed my hump.

948
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:22,478
Use it, sweetheart.
People will pity you

949
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:23,345
For your deformity,

950
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,359
And you're sure to win.

951
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:28,160
Maybe if you put
Your arm on my shoulder.

952
00:44:28,256 --> 00:44:30,560
Keep your arm on my shoulder
At all times. 

953
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:32,876
If I win We'll go up together,

954
00:44:32,972 --> 00:44:34,613
Your arm around me.

955
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,532
They'll think we're
Still mad for each other

956
00:44:36,628 --> 00:44:37,232
After 12 years.

957
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:40,224
Oh, I thought we were.
I keep forgetting. 

958
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,335
How many gin and tonics
Have you had?

959
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:44,704
Three gins and one tonic.
Catch up on the tonics...

960
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,713
We don't want to be
Disgusting tonight, do we?...

961
00:44:50,032 --> 00:44:52,320
What's wrong with my hair?

962
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,456
I look like
I've combed it with a towel.

963
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:57,296
When you played Elizabeth
You looked like a warthog,

964
00:44:57,392 --> 00:44:58,448
And you never complained once.

965
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:00,480
That was acting.
This is living.

966
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:03,104
Living,
I want to be beautiful.

967
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,271
It's the strangest color.
I asked for a simple rinse,

968
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,864
And that ditsy queen's
Given me crayon.  

969
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,944
Shall I walk with my arm
On your head as well?

970
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,552
Oh, Christ. I hate
Getting dressed like this.

971
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:17,534
Why is it I知 always
Perfectly comfortable

972
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,481
As somebody else?

973
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:20,800
I'd of been perfectly happy
Going as Hedda Gabler.  

974
00:45:20,896 --> 00:45:24,415
Try Quasimodo.
Try shutting up!

975
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:28,384
Now, check me out.
Do I have too much jewelry on?...

976
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,240
Jingle it. I can't tell
If I don't hear it.

977
00:45:30,335 --> 00:45:32,138
Will you please
Be nice to me and pay me

978
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:33,328
One bloody compliment?

979
00:45:33,424 --> 00:45:35,368
I've been getting ready
For this horseshit affair

980
00:45:35,464 --> 00:45:36,112
For three hours.

981
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,880
- Diana, you're just--
- what? What?

982
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:41,536
[ chuckling ] I was-- 

983
00:45:41,632 --> 00:45:43,628
I was just gonna say
You're making a mountain

984
00:45:43,724 --> 00:45:44,432
Out of a molehill.

985
00:45:44,528 --> 00:45:46,368
But I didn't think
It would amuse you.

986
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:48,415
That's not funny, Sidney. ...

987
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:51,343
That's bizarre.
Give me a drink.

988
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:56,159
You have the most bizarre
Sense of humor.

989
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:58,212
Bizarre people often do.

990
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,879
Give me a bit more.
It's all right.

991
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:04,799
I won't get pissed
Till after I lose. 

992
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,096
The car is waiting.
Oh, god.

993
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:10,432
Why do they have
These things so early?

994
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:13,920
I mean, no woman can look good
At 5:00 in the afternoon, 

995
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:16,351
Except possibly
Tatum O誰eal.

996
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:18,976
Finish your drink.
Mmm.

997
00:46:19,072 --> 00:46:22,740
I don't want to miss
The sound editing awards.

998
00:46:22,897 --> 00:46:25,792
Oh, those bloody photographers
And newsmen.

999
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:28,610
I can't wait
To see how they explain

1000
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,624
My hump in the papers.

1001
00:46:34,512 --> 00:46:36,479
Where are you going?
I need another drink. ...

1002
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:39,265
The last one
Wore off in the lift.

1003
00:46:41,104 --> 00:46:44,365
Gin and tonic, please.
Nothing for me...

1004
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:48,531
I heard that if you're late,
They put nondescript people

1005
00:46:48,627 --> 00:46:49,360
In your seats.

1006
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:51,455
Do you know what I might do
Next year, Sidney?

1007
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:52,592
I pray anything but Ibsen.

1008
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:55,072
I might give it all up.

1009
00:46:55,168 --> 00:46:57,695
It's no fun anymore.
Oh, god, how I envy you.

1010
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,038
You're the one With all the talent.

1011
00:46:59,134 --> 00:46:59,600
I'm the one...

1012
00:46:59,696 --> 00:47:01,491
Who has to make
A horse's ass of myself.

1013
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:01,872
Talent?

1014
00:47:01,968 --> 00:47:04,447
What talent do I have?
You have nothing but talent.

1015
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,624
You cook better than I do,
You write better than I do.

1016
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,544
God knows you dress
Better than I do.  

1017
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,424
Better than "I."
The "do" is superfluous.

1018
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,376
You speak better than I do--

1019
00:47:13,472 --> 00:47:15,392
What's that green slime
You're eating?

1020
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:17,344
It looks like a dish
Out of Oliver Twist. </i></i>

1021
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,158
I'm not sure.
I think they run the front lawn

1022
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,456
Through a blender.

1023
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:23,584
You've got that glazed look
In your eye again, Sidney--

1024
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,047
That "bored-with-her-life"
Attitude.   

1025
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,511
I'm never bored
With your life, my angel. ...

1026
00:47:28,607 --> 00:47:30,752
I love the openings
And the parties. ...

1027
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:34,432
I lead a very gay life.
Let's be honest, pet. ...

1028
00:47:34,528 --> 00:47:35,947
How many antique dealers
Get to go to

1029
00:47:36,043 --> 00:47:36,848
The academy awards?

1030
00:47:36,944 --> 00:47:38,783
I think you hate
That dusty little shop.

1031
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:40,173
You're never there When I call.

1032
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:41,169
Could I, miss Barrie?

1033
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:42,704
It's for my daughter.
Excuse me.

1034
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,376
Oh, certainly.

1035
00:47:43,472 --> 00:47:45,188
What's her name?
Uh--

1036
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:47,202
Just say, "to frank."

1037
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:53,718
What do you do
With your afternoons, Sidney?...

1038
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,564
In London?
I don't think

1039
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,578
We have afternoons.

1040
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:01,368
Gin and tonic, pl-- Check, please...

1041
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:07,054
Come along.

1042
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,832
you should never have</i></i>
given it up, Sidney. </i> </i>

1043
00:48:12,928 --> 00:48:15,328
What?
Acting.

1044
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:17,660
Christ, you were good.
You had more promise

1045
00:48:17,756 --> 00:48:18,480
Than any of us.

1046
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:21,247
Really? I can't think
What it was I promised.

1047
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:23,616
You were so gentle
On the stage.

1048
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:25,536
So unselfish, so giving.

1049
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:28,192
You had a sweet,
Gentle quality.

1050
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:31,072
Yes. I would've made
A wonderful Ophelia.

1051
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:32,992
You could go back, Sidney,
If you wanted to.

1052
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:35,679
We could do plays together,
Have more time together.

1053
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:39,251
No, there'd be problems.
It would be awful if we were

1054
00:48:39,347 --> 00:48:41,072
Both up for the same part.

1055
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,415
I'm perfectly happy selling
My 18th century door knockers...

1056
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:45,924
You still haven't told me
What you do

1057
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,832
With your afternoons.

1058
00:48:46,928 --> 00:48:49,440
I just told you,
I look for knockers.

1059
00:48:49,536 --> 00:48:51,655
[ speaking Spanish ] 

1060
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,167
I think I got it stopped,
But you won't be able to use

1061
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:56,240
The water in the bathroom...

1062
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:58,176
For a while.
Oh, it's okay...

1063
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:00,758
We have enough
On the floor to last us.

1064
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:01,520
Thank you.

1065
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:03,967
Okay, hurry up.
What? Lola--

1066
00:49:04,063 --> 00:49:06,831
The man is 20 minutes late.

1067
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:10,943
How would you like to be lying
On an operating table...

1068
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,472
With tubes going in your nose,
Waiting for him to show up?

1069
00:49:15,568 --> 00:49:17,407
Your brother's
Gonna pay for this.

1070
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:19,578
I'm tired of being nice
To that man. The next time

1071
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:20,336
I take his x rays,

1072
00:49:20,432 --> 00:49:22,272
Wait till I tell him
What I found on them.

1073
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:24,121
My feet are still wet.
The foot powder

1074
00:49:24,217 --> 00:49:25,360
Is turning into concrete.

I am sick and disgusted
Of stepping on raw fish.....

1077
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:30,848
In my stocking feet That that man

1078
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:31,600
Drops on the floor.

1079
00:49:31,696 --> 00:49:35,772
Now, come on, woman.
This is pearl harbor night...

1080
00:49:39,248 --> 00:49:40,876
Can we get going?
I'll drive.

1081
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:41,680
You'll what?

1082
00:49:41,776 --> 00:49:43,416
Do you know where Fujiyama's is?

1083
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:43,631
No.

1084
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:45,353
I'll drive.
Why don't you two argue

1085
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,480
In the back? I'll drive.

1086
00:49:46,576 --> 00:49:49,510
Okay, honey.
"okay, honey"? Watch out

1087
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:51,878
When he says, "okay, honey."

1088
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,760
I feel like
A caged animal, Sidney.

1089
00:50:01,856 --> 00:50:03,775
They look as though they're
Going to throw nuts at us.

1090
00:50:03,871 --> 00:50:05,408
[ Sidney ] Nonsense, darling.

1091
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:06,704
They're just ogling us.

1092
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,286
I adore being ogled,
Don't you?

1093
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:08,913
Oh, Sidney!

1094
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:11,008
Yes?   

1095
00:50:11,104 --> 00:50:14,446
Sidney, kiss me.
Kiss me and wish me luck.

1096
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:20,527
There's your kiss.
Now turn around so I can

1097
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,497
Rub your hump for luck.

1098
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:26,240
Sidney, please be nice to me.

01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:19,423
Why don't you stick to
Your own kind, Sidney?

1409
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,871
If there's anything I hate,
It's a bisexual homosexual.

1410
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,166
or is it The other way 'round?

1411
01:05:26,262 --> 01:05:27,663
it works either way.

1412
01:05:27,759 --> 01:05:31,438
Jesus god, Sidney,
I love you so much.  

1413
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:36,606
- I know that, darling.
- why do you stay with me?

1414
01:05:36,702 --> 01:05:39,615
What do you get from me that
Could possibly satisfy you?

1415
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:42,750
A wider circle of prospects.

1416
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:46,677
I am a minor celebrity
Once removed. 

1417
01:05:48,047 --> 01:05:51,743
Sorry I didn't win
That award tonight.

1418
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:54,527
Your dance card would have
Been filled for a year.

1419
01:05:54,623 --> 01:05:57,407
We haven't done
Too badly together.

1420
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,902
I'm kinder to you
Than your average stuntman.

1421
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:03,519
There was a time, Sidney, ...

1422
01:06:03,615 --> 01:06:07,039
When I thought you'd
Give it all up for me.

1423
01:06:11,311 --> 01:06:13,887
I love you, my angel,

1424
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:17,263
More than any woman
I've ever known.  

1425
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,205
Christ,
I can't get a break.

1426
01:06:22,222 --> 01:06:26,207
I do the best I can.
Thank you.

1427
01:06:26,303 --> 01:06:28,141
You can't say we don't
Have fun together.

1428
01:06:28,237 --> 01:06:28,750
Oh, hell, no.

1429
01:06:28,846 --> 01:06:33,656
The dinner conversations alone
Are worth the trouble.  

1430

[ yawning ] Sorry.  

1431
01:06:44,062 --> 01:06:47,040
Sorry, Sidney.
It wasn't the kiss.

1432
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,126
It's my life.

1433
01:06:48,222 --> 01:06:51,758
Tired? Come on, then.

1434
01:06:52,783 --> 01:06:56,319
Losing Oscars always
Does that to me.

1435
01:06:56,415 --> 01:07:00,990
I'll get up first thing
And order your eggs benedict.

1436
01:07:01,086 --> 01:07:04,350
You do take care of me, Sidney.
I'll say that.

1437
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:07,614
And good help is
So hard to find these days.

1438
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:11,310
You scratch my back,
And I値l scratch yours.

1439
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:19,950
It's been an evening
Of ups and downs, hasn't it? ...

1440
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:22,893
Mm-hmm.

Care to continue the motion? ...

Tacky.  

1443

You're getting tacky,
My angel.

1444
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:43,085
I love you, Sidney.

1445
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:56,511
Don't close your eyes,
Sidney.    

1446
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:58,702
I always close my eyes.

1447
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:02,094
Not tonight.

1448
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,869
Look at me tonight.

1449

Long. The serve was long.

You're half asleep.
How can you see

1453
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:28,910
The serve was long?

Orthopedics, 'cause he won't

Be able to walk after this.

How can you call

That ball long?

1461
01:08:47,134 --> 01:08:49,971
It's simple.
Like this: looooong!

1462
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:51,838
Now, serve the ball.

1463
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:53,876
Serve the ball, Willis.
We only have the court

For an hour.

1465

You should hear sitting up.

Millie,

You mean more to me
Than you could possibly know. ...

1689
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:02,286
But sometimes we transgress.

1690
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:06,382
Sometimes we do foolish things
Which unwittingly...

1691
01:20:06,478 --> 01:20:08,462
Cause hurt and injury
To the other.

1692
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:10,478
I don't think you've ever
Consciously hurt me.

Consciously, no. ...

1694
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:17,550
But a careless word here,
A foolish gesture... There--

1695
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,668
Nothing major, Marvin.
We've had disagreements,

1696
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:21,886
But nothing major.

1697
01:20:21,982 --> 01:20:24,098
I'm glad you
Brought that up, Millie.

1698
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,174
What would you consider major?

1699
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:29,112
Major? I don't know.
I-I can't picture you

Doing anything major.

1701
01:20:30,879 --> 01:20:32,883
I-I guess if you were
Cruel to the children,

1702
01:20:32,979 --> 01:20:33,982
That would be major.

1703
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:36,360
I would put that number one.

1704
01:20:36,429 --> 01:20:38,404
I would say that
That was the worst thing

1705
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,965
A man could do in a marriage.

1706
01:20:40,061 --> 01:20:42,625
To be cruel to the children
Is unpardonable.

1707
01:20:42,721 --> 01:20:44,254
All else could be forgiven.

1708
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:45,627
If I caught you
With another woman,

1709
01:20:45,723 --> 01:20:46,462
That would be major.

1710
01:20:46,558 --> 01:20:49,358
Let's not get off
The children thing so fast...

1711
01:20:49,454 --> 01:20:51,560
To me, children are

01:21:03,949 --> 01:21:06,465
So-- Let's go to the living room.

1718
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,479
God, I致e missed you.

1719
01:21:10,622 --> 01:21:12,338
Let's make love In the living room.

1720
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,406
You've missed me?

1721
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:17,315
You've only been away one night.
I know, but there's

1722
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:19,518
A three-hour time difference.

1723
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:23,053
My god, I致e never
Seen you look so pretty.

1724
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:26,510
Come here,
You cute little thing.

1725
01:21:26,605 --> 01:21:28,654
Don't be ridiculous.
There's not even a bed in here...

1726
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:31,178
Oh. Oh, well.
They-- they have

1727
01:21:31,274 --> 01:21:32,717
Terrific carpeting.

1728
01:21:32,813 --> 01:21:34,995
Come on.
We tried pot last year.

1729
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:37,023
Let's try carpeting this year.

1730
01:21:37,118 --> 01:21:40,568
Maybe tonight.
If I don't lie down,

1731
01:21:40,664 --> 01:21:41,902
I'll pass out.

1732
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:46,062
Millie! Millie, wait!
Millie, don't! Millie!

1733
01:21:46,157 --> 01:21:47,912
You don't Have to get so upset.

1734
01:21:48,007 --> 01:21:48,766
I said tonight.

1735
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,072
I've never seen you So sex-crazed

1736
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:52,158
In the morning.

1737
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:54,158
I didn't realize
It was the morning. 

1738
01:21:54,254 --> 01:21:58,572
Why don't you just
Lie down next to me

1739
01:21:58,668 --> 01:21:59,822
And relax?

1740
01:21:59,918 --> 01:22:02,830
We don't have to make love...

1741
01:22:02,926 --> 01:22:07,533
Just lie down next to me
For-- for half an hour...

1742
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:08,998
Come on. You can
Do that, can't you?

1743
01:22:09,094 --> 01:22:09,598
[ whimpering ]...

1744
01:22:09,694 --> 01:22:11,612
Come on. ...

1745
01:22:13,566 --> 01:22:15,848
[ continues whimpering ] ...

1746
01:22:25,182 --> 01:22:27,846
what are you doing Down there?

1747
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:30,221
my back is acting up again.

1748
01:22:30,317 --> 01:22:33,741
the bed is too soft.
- I don't believe that

1749
01:22:33,827 --> 01:22:35,391
For a second.

1750
01:22:35,487 --> 01:22:37,782
Millie,
I can't keep this up anymore.

1751
01:22:37,877 --> 01:22:39,742
I'm gonna get a heart attack.

1752
01:22:39,838 --> 01:22:42,893
I'm gonna tell you something,
Millie, and this is the truth...

1753
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:44,907
No more lies.

1754
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,358
It was never my intention
To hurt you, Millie,

1755
01:22:49,454 --> 01:22:52,782
But it's very possible
That in the next few minutes.....

1756
01:22:52,878 --> 01:22:55,181
You may be terribly,
Terribly hurt. 

1757
01:22:55,277 --> 01:22:58,574
Uh-huh.
Is it major or minor?

1758
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:01,903
To me it's minor.
To you I think it's going to be

1759
01:23:01,999 --> 01:23:03,165
Extremely major.

1760
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:05,646
Well, tell me, Marvin.

1761
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:09,260
It couldn't be that bad,
As long as you're not

1762
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:11,774
Trying to cover up something.

1763
01:23:11,901 --> 01:23:14,706
I'd like to show you something,
Millie, but I知 gonna ask you

1764
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:16,126
To do something for me first.

1765
01:23:16,222 --> 01:23:19,813
Say nothing for ten seconds.
Whatever comes to mind, please,

1766
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:21,405
For the sake of both of us,

1767
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:24,110
Say nothing for ten seconds. ...

1768
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:44,379
I'm praying, Marvin.

1769
01:23:44,397 --> 01:23:48,398
I'm praying that the maid
Came in to clean...  

1770
01:23:48,494 --> 01:23:52,651
And got dizzy from overwork
And fainted in your bed?

1771
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:57,038
It's not the maid, Millie.
Well, then,

1772
01:23:57,134 --> 01:24:01,165
I'm very anxious to hear
Who it is, Marvin.

1773
01:24:01,261 --> 01:24:04,671
I can't wait to hear
What you have to say next...

1774
01:24:04,767 --> 01:24:08,516
I'm waiting, Marvin.
I'm waiting too.  

1775
01:24:09,022 --> 01:24:11,533
You know what my guess is?...

1776
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:14,122
My guess is that that's
A woman in your bed.

1777
01:24:14,218 --> 01:24:15,742
That's my guess too, Millie.

1778
01:24:15,838 --> 01:24:20,029
What woman,
You can tell me in court. ...

1779
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:26,062
I'm leaving now, Marvin.

1780
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:28,244
Before I go,
I want to ask you

1781
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,694
One silly question.

1782
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:33,870
- why doesn't she move?
- I can explain that. 

1783
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:35,582
Don't tell me
You've been carrying on

1784
01:24:35,678 --> 01:24:36,766
With a helpless paralytic.

1785
01:24:36,862 --> 01:24:39,565
I won't buy it, Marvin...

1786
01:24:39,661 --> 01:24:42,340
Millie, she drank
A whole bottle of tequila

1787
01:24:42,436 --> 01:24:43,102
By herself!

1788
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:47,118
Set and match point
Coming up.  

1789
01:24:47,214 --> 01:24:50,474
watch it!
- like I watched the gauge? ...

1790
01:24:56,318 --> 01:24:58,274
It's mine!
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1791
01:24:58,334 --> 01:24:59,678
Look out.

1792
01:24:59,774 --> 01:25:01,582
Chauncey, lob it! 

1793
01:25:01,678 --> 01:25:03,758
I got it.
- I got it, I got it, I got it...

1794
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:05,985
I got it, I got it.
Willis, I got it.

1795
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:07,678
ooh, I got it. Watch it!

1796
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:10,109
Oh!  

1797
01:25:11,518 --> 01:25:14,013
ow! </i>   </i>

1798
01:25:16,094 --> 01:25:19,712
Ooh. Ooh! It's broken.
Oh, god. It's broken.

1799
01:25:19,808 --> 01:25:20,749
I can feel it.

1800
01:25:20,845 --> 01:25:24,353
It's not broken. It's sprained.
You're a nose and throat man.

1801
01:25:24,449 --> 01:25:25,549
How do you know?

1802
01:25:25,645 --> 01:25:27,821
We were dead drunk,
The both of us.

1803
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:30,149
You think I壇 do something
Like that stone sober?

1804
01:25:30,245 --> 01:25:31,613
Let me tell you something else.

1805
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,697
Being cruel to the children is</i>

1806
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:36,054
Number two. that's</i>
number one.</i>

1807
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:37,054
To you, Millie.

1808
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,983
I can understand it being
Important to you.

1809
01:25:39,079 --> 01:25:40,222
To me it was meaningless.

1810
01:25:40,318 --> 01:25:42,104
That's a shame, Marvin.
I always get so upset when

1811
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,166
You don't have a good time.

1812
01:25:43,262 --> 01:25:45,101
good, good. Get it out. </i> ...</i>

1813
01:25:45,197 --> 01:25:47,682
The quicker you get it out,
The quicker you'll be

1814
01:25:47,778 --> 01:25:48,189
Rid of it.

1815
01:25:48,285 --> 01:25:51,182
God.
And what do I do now?

1816
01:25:51,277 --> 01:25:53,549
Do you expect me to go
To your nephew's bar mitzvah...

1817
01:25:53,645 --> 01:25:55,602
And say "congratulations"
To the man who paid that woman

1818
01:25:55,698 --> 01:25:56,573
To sleep with my husband?

1819
01:25:56,669 --> 01:25:58,747
He'll probably wink at you.
He doesn't know

1820
01:25:58,843 --> 01:25:59,549
That you know.

1821
01:25:59,645 --> 01:26:01,142
I see.
Well, then the joke's on him.

1822
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:02,685
Only you and I know that I know.

1823
01:26:02,781 --> 01:26:04,387
You're right, Millie.
You don't deserve to be

1824
01:26:04,483 --> 01:26:05,086
Treated like that.

1825
01:26:05,182 --> 01:26:07,296
Forget the bar mitzvah. I'll go
Back with you on the next plane

1826
01:26:07,392 --> 01:26:08,158
If that's what you want.

1827
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:10,920
No. I will not give
You or your family

1828
01:26:11,015 --> 01:26:12,285
That satisfaction.

1829
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:14,365
I am going to behave
With more dignity

1830
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:15,678
Than you ever dreamed.

1831
01:26:15,774 --> 01:26:18,861
I am going to that bar mitzvah
With my head held high.

1832
01:26:18,957 --> 01:26:23,405
I am not going to divorce you.
I am going to forgive you.

1833
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:26,958
I am going to forget
This ever happened. I am going

1834
01:26:27,054 --> 01:26:29,086
To figure out why it happened,

1835
01:26:29,182 --> 01:26:32,252
And I知 never going
To bring it up again

1836
01:26:32,348 --> 01:26:33,566
As long as I live.

1837
01:26:33,662 --> 01:26:37,005
And now, I知 going in there,

1838
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:40,933
And I知 going to spend
Every last cent you have.

1839
01:26:43,773 --> 01:26:46,349
Here we go, dear. Here we go.
To the right. To the right. ...

1840
01:26:46,445 --> 01:26:48,454
Oh, I feel like a piano--
A dead piano.

1841
01:26:48,549 --> 01:26:48,990
All right.

1842
01:26:49,086 --> 01:26:52,045
Lola, please get a wet towel
Out of our bathroom.

1843
01:26:52,141 --> 01:26:53,876
[ moaning ] You mean,

1844
01:26:53,972 --> 01:26:55,890
This is all your room?

1845
01:26:57,438 --> 01:26:59,403
Huh? I slept standing up,
And you're living like

1846
01:26:59,499 --> 01:27:00,862
The king and queen of England?

1847
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:02,549
The queen is about to
Abdicate her leg

1848
01:27:02,644 --> 01:27:03,773
If we don't get her into bed.

1849
01:27:03,869 --> 01:27:07,917
Lola! Lola, I want you
To see what they got--...

1850
01:27:08,013 --> 01:27:08,861
[ yells ] Oh, god.

1851
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:09,822
[ glass shatters ]...

1852
01:27:09,918 --> 01:27:11,444
What happened, damn it?
Oh.

1853
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,318
[ clears throat ]...

1854
01:27:12,414 --> 01:27:14,830
I broke a bottle of perfume.
I'm sorry, Bett.

1855
01:27:14,926 --> 01:27:17,357
Don't worry.
It was only $90 an ounce. ...

1856
01:27:17,453 --> 01:27:19,372
Of all the stupid-ass Things to do--

1857
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:19,902
Hold on.

1858
01:27:19,998 --> 01:27:21,739
She did not do it on purpose.
You mean it was

1859
01:27:21,835 --> 01:27:22,590
A planned accident?

1860
01:27:22,686 --> 01:27:25,158
We don't have to take this crap.
We can go up to our cigar box

1861
01:27:25,254 --> 01:27:26,558
And watch our broken television.

1862

ow! Oh, I cut my finger. </i></i>

1863
01:27:30,989 --> 01:27:34,445
It's bleeding.
Oh, damn, that perfume burns!...

1864
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,228
Only good perfume.
Cheap perfume

1865
01:27:36,324 --> 01:27:37,246
You can't feel at all.

1866
01:27:37,342 --> 01:27:39,974
Oh, Bett, there's broken glass
On the bathroom floor.

1867
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:41,373
Be careful where you step.

1868
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:44,220
I'm glad you told me.
I was gonna walk in there

1869
01:27:44,316 --> 01:27:44,958
A lot today.

01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:20,189
Are you serious?

2028
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:22,285
I didn't come 3,000 miles
To be late.

2029
01:34:22,381 --> 01:34:23,645
Get in the cab, Marvin.

2030
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:26,189
Do you know who that is?
Yes, it's our hooker. ...

2031
01:34:26,285 --> 01:34:29,005
You think I壇 ride
With strangers? ...

Live out here?
Sometimes.

2036
01:34:35,533 --> 01:34:38,800
Passengers holding
A blue boarding pass may

2037
01:34:38,896 --> 01:34:40,989
Enter the aircraft at gate 37-a.

2038
01:34:41,085 --> 01:34:43,003
Thank you.

2039
01:34:43,084 --> 01:34:45,741
Mother! Whew!

2040
01:34:45,837 --> 01:34:47,241
I was afraid I wouldn't make it.

2041
01:34:47,337 --> 01:34:48,541
What are you doing here?

2042
01:34:48,637 --> 01:34:51,309
Where's your father? ...

2043
01:34:51,405 --> 01:34:52,797
My god.
Was it the lima beans

2044
01:34:52,892 --> 01:34:53,533
And broccoli?

2045
01:34:53,629 --> 01:34:56,973
No, no. He's waiting
Outside in the car.

2046
01:34:57,069 --> 01:35:00,604
I just wanted to say
Good-bye and thank you.

2047
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:03,749
And I love you.

2048
01:35:09,534 --> 01:35:10,746
You don't know
What this means to me.

2049
01:35:10,842 --> 01:35:11,613
I've been very depressed.

2050
01:35:11,709 --> 01:35:15,296
I just found out
I've already seen the movie.

2051
01:35:18,014 --> 01:35:21,132
I'm gonna miss you, mother,
But I know I知 doing the--

2052

No, no, jenny.
Don't say it.

2053
01:35:22,993 --> 01:35:23,742
It's all right.

2054
01:35:23,838 --> 01:35:27,405
I'm doing the right thing.
There. I said it anyways.

2055
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:29,621
This is for you.  

2056
01:35:31,037 --> 01:35:32,459
What is that?
It's a map

2057
01:35:32,555 --> 01:35:34,238
Of the movie stars' homes,

2058
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:38,654
Just in case you ever
Make it out this way again.

2059
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:48,430
Sir, I知 sorry about
Dropping that suitcase.

2060
01:35:48,525 --> 01:35:50,163
Oh, that's all right.
It wasn't the foot

2061
01:35:50,259 --> 01:35:51,133
With the glass in it.

2062
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:52,421
Tell the hostess I have to sit with

2063
01:35:52,517 --> 01:35:53,629
My good eye near the window.

2064
01:35:53,725 --> 01:35:56,109
I don't want to miss
The grand canyon again...

2065
01:35:56,205 --> 01:35:57,583
[ raspy ] How can I lecture

2066
01:35:57,678 --> 01:35:59,037
And operate on Monday?

2067
01:35:59,133 --> 01:36:02,876
I can't speak,
And I can't look down...

2068
01:36:06,109 --> 01:36:07,771
