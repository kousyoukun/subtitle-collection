00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,892
The New Republic Magazine was
first published in 1914.

2
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:25,336
it has been a fixture of American
political commentary ever since.

3
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,802
in May of 1998, its staff was
comprised of 15 writer/editors.

4
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:33,779
Their median age was 26.

5
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:39,354
The youngest among them was
Stephen Glass.

6
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,960
There's so many show-offs
in journalism...

7
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:50,792
...so many braggarts and jerks.

8
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,469
They're always selling,
always working the room...

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,231
...always trying to make themselves
look hotter than they actually are.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,843
The good news is, reporters like that
make it easy to distinguish yourself.

11
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:03,910
lf you're even a little bit humble...

12
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:07,208
...a little self-effacing or solicitous,
you stand out.

13
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:10,147
So you bring a co-worker lunch
if he's under deadline.

14
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:11,843
You remember birthdays.

15
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,183
it's true, journalism is hard work.
Everybody's under pressure.

16
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:18,623
Everybody grinds to get the issue out.
Nobody gets any sleep...

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,093
...but you are allowed to smile
every once in a while.

18
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,791
Even Woodward and Bernstein
went out for a burger now and then...

19
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,027
...and they won a Pulitzer.

20
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:33,539
Some reporters think political content
makes a story memorable.

21
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:37,543
l think it's the people you find,
their quirks, their flaws...

22
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,614
...what makes them funny,
what makes them human.

23
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:43,786
Journalism is just
the art of capturing behaviour.

24

To Wrap Around Your Slick Willy!

26
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:51,122
You have to know
who you're writing for.

27
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,489
And you have to know
what you're good at.

28
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,358
l record what people do.

29
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:58,500
l find out what moves them,
what scares them...

30
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,695
...and l write that down. That way,
they're the ones telling the story.

31
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:04,271
And you know what?

32
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:07,375
Those kind of pieces
can win Pulitzers too.

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,148
...associate editor
of The New Republic Magazine...

40
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,512
...in Washington D.C.

41
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:29,724
Sorry if I'm beaming,
but l was his journalistic muse.

42
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,450
it's true.

43
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:37,322
-Just seven years ago, he was sitting--
-Right there.

44
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,492
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,364
Right there.

46
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,768
And l was doing the exact same thing
you guys are doing:

47
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,737
Grinding out pieces and then...

48
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:51,312
...having horrid nightmares of
Mrs. Duke and her infamous red pen.

49
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:58,815
And see what happens
when greatness is demanded of you?

50
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:01,687
Now he's at The New Republic.

51
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,494
And now I'm at The New Republic.

52
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,543
in May, the editors
of The New Republic Magazine....

53
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,378
The Washington Post, The New
Republic, The Boston Globe--

54
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:33,317
But the bill was blasted
in The New Republic this week.

HACK HEAVEN
By Stephen Glass

59
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:48,358
So l said, ''Network news,
network news....

60
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:52,331
That's that show that's on between
those Fixodent commerciais, right?''

61
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:53,968
Shut him up.

62
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,896
-Hey, Steve.
-Hey, Steve.

63
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,369
Hey, guys.

64
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,311
-Gloria, that necklace is you.
-Thanks, doll.

65
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,981
l got some new merchandise
for your girlfriend.

66
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:07,672
When l get this piece done.

67
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,647
-How's it coming?
-Horrible.

68
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,755
it's the fundamental nature
of the magazine, Lew.

69
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,357
MeIanie, can l get some copies,
please?

70
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,027
People want photographs,
they can buy Newsweek.

71
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:22,561
They do buy Newsweek, and Time
and U.S. News & World Report...

72
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,665
...and our losses are a joke.

73
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,961
Let me guess,
he's on you again about a redesign.

74
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:31,004
-Cover page and graphics.
-And photographs.

75
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:32,538
Let me remind you, Steve...

76
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:35,802
...this magazine hasn't
changed its look since the '80s.

77
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,746
-How is it?
-it's good.

78
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,048
-You hate it.
-No, it's good. it's just a little rough.

79
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,382
No, it's the worst thing l ever wrote.
That's horrible.

80
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,684
lf you don't help me, l won't send it in.

81
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,087
When's it due?

82
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,927
Tomorrow.

83
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:57,761
l may have to kill myself.

84
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,667
l mean,
The New York Times Magazine.

85
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:04,038
Will you guys help me with it? Please?

86
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,174
-Of course.
-Of course.

87
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,604
Thank you.

88
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:11,171
Call for you on three, sweetie.
Someone from Policy Review.

89
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:13,542
When did you start
talking to Policy Review?

90
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,719
I'm not. it's probably nothing.
Send it to my voice mail.

91
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,181
And, sweetie...

92
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:22,222
...Caitlin just told me that she needs
gifts for two showers next week.

93
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:26,054
-Think you have something for her?
-I'll get my box.

94
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:30,792
-l couldn't resist.
-So you want to do this now?

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,026
Yeah, in a second. l just have
to return a quick phone call.

96
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:37,603
l got you some gum.

97
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,011
lf l were to throw a party...

98
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,874
...where all we did was play Monopoly,
would you guys come?

99
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:49,313
-Could l be the little shoe?
-Of course.

100
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:52,611
The lawyers have asked us
to tone down the cover on Serbia.

101
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,585
Yeah, they fear charges of libel.

102
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,658
l know a little bit of libel law.

103
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,125
it's only relevant if said person
has been out of the public eye.

104
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,357
Well, yeah, so there's Serbia, hidden,
unknown to the world at large...

105
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,628
...until it appeared on the cover
of The New Republic.

106
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:12,399
-With our weekly circulation of 80,000.
-Eighty-one five.

107
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,599
-You done with it, Rob?
-Two days, tops.

108
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,472
Yes, two days from Hanukkah.

109
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,170
Hey, it's basically finished,
for the most part.

110
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,577
Next up. Amy?

111
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,419
Just finished the piece
on ethanol subsidies.

112
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,590
There are 16,800 magazines
in this country...

113
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,853
...but only one calls itself the in-flight
magazine of Air Force One.

114
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,160
And that's the thrill of working
at The New Republic.

115
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,834
You're underpaid,
the hours are brutal...

116
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,869
...but what you write gets read
by people who matter.

117
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,733
Presidents, lawmakers--

118
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,308
Your work can actually
influence public policy.

119
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:53,141
That's an amazing privilege
and a huge responsibility.

120
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:58,654
I'm sorry, they don't want the whole
journalistic-responsibility speech.

121
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,455
Do you?

122
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:04,358
You just wanna know how
to get your name in print, right?

123
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,054
Sounds familiar.

124
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:12,826
Okay. Let me take you through
the life of your typical piece...

125
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,026
...so you can see
where the hurdles are.

126
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:17,297
We'll use one l wrote last year...

127
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:20,965
...about a bunch of young Republicans
at a conservatives convention.

128
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,202

to do anything sneaky or dishonest...

131
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:32,684

such as assuming a phoney identity.

a pretty good turnout to me.

134
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:44,898
No, man, conservatism's dead.

135
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,035
-Dead?
-We're lost.

136
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,760
Damn straight!

137
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,105
On a story like that,
your notes are crucial.

138
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,742
You have to record
everything you see and hear...

139
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,878
...every quote, every detail...

140
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,877
...all the way down
to the mini-bottles in the fridge.

141
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,550
We're like this guy who has to pee:

142
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,879
Lost in the desert looking for a tree.

143
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,556
-it's true.
-Completely true.

144
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,528
You guys know what
you're shopping for, right?

145
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:16,993
Totally.

146
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,458
Get us a real heifer.

147
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:23,633
The fatter the better.
Bad acne would be a bonus.

148
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,104
Let's do it!

00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,221
Pretty standard stuff.

158
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,363
Hotel ballrooms, boring speeches,
chicken dinners.

159
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:30,270
Which is why everybody spends
their time in the suites upstairs...

160
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:32,168
...committing felonies.

161
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,303
Oh, yeah?

162
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,805
Yeah, l went to one.
The ballroom is empty.

163
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:39,845
Every delegate under the age of 25...

164
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,244
...was up on the fifth floor
getting loaded.

165
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:46,046
Drugs, binge drinking, hookers....
Gets pretty ugly.

166
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,351
-Sounds great, Steve.
-So does yours.

167
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:56,030
Okay, well.... l gotta get back to work.

168
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,962
-Have a good lunch.
-Thanks.

169
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:03,871
Hold it. l have to give myself
a demerit for poor scene-setting.

170
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,837
Let me explain. A year ago,
Chuck Iane and l were peers.

171
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,442
He hadn't become editor yet.

172
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,010
Michael Kelly was editing
the magazine then.

173
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:14,376
Sorry, Mrs. Duke.
l know how you feel about clarity.

174
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,522
We've gotta start
calling some other places.

175
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:26,559
l don't think l can
eat this stuff every day.

176
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,821
it was the Cannon Building.
You had it as Russell. l fixed it.

177
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,227
Thank you.

178
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,233
-l really liked it, Ames.
-But boring, right?

179
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,665
No, l really, really liked it.

180
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:45,378
-Yes, dear?
-Somebody for you on three.

181
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,946
Someone from Harper's.

182
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:51,083
-When did you start talking to them?
-I'm not. it's probably nothing.

183
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,118
-Send it to my voice mail.
-Very good.

184
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,723
By the way, Glo,
that lipstick is the bomb.

185
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,854
Thanks, doll.

186
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,995
What is it, Midnight Mist?

187
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,567
-l really got to stop doing that.
-What?

188
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,738
All l do is give people
more reasons to assume I'm gay.

189
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,206
l mean, lately, it's everyone.

190
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:15,468
The other night, l went to dinner
with this guy from The Post.

191
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,545
-Who?
-l can't tell you. He made me promise.

192
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,443
We're walking around afterwards...

193
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,277
...talking about Medicare
for God's sakes.

194
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:28,253
Then, the next thing l know, we're
standing on the corner of 18th and T...

195
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:33,389
...and he somehow managed to slip
his tongue down my throat.

196
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:38,528
And I'm like, ''Wait a minute,
how'd this happen?''

197
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,005
-l don't understand.
-Yeah, neither did l.

198
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,107
-Hey.
-Michael.

199
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:47,536
-Got a minute?
-Of course.

200
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,303
We have a problem with
the ''Spring Breakdown'' piece.

201
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:53,641
Just got a letter from David Keene.
He ran the CPAC conference.

202
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:56,010
-He's made some--
-Are you mad at me?

203
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,646
He's made some pretty serious
charges. We need to answer them.

204
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,986
Okay. My notes are at home. l can be
back in 20 minutes. is that too long?

205
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:08,789
Do your notes have anything
about the minibars? That would help.

206
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,796
l think so. No, I'm sure. Why?

207
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:15,629
He claims the Omni Shoreham
doesn't even have minibars.

208
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:20,302
l saw them. No, there were little
bottles of booze all over the room.

209
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:25,874
Okay. I'll get Aaron and Rob into it
and start the fact-check again.

210
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,380
-I'll get my notes.
-Thank you.

211
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,312
I'm sorry, we'll have to finish this later.

212
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,216
No, no, l understand. Thank you.

213
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:49,799
What's wrong?

214
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,469
Just tell me.

215
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,802
Keene was right, Michael.

216
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:06,847
l messed up. l made a huge error.

217
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,665
l don't know what to say.
lf you want me to resign, l will.

218
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,269
l want you to tell me what happened.

219
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:28,937
They don't have minibars
at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.

220
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,579
l guess l just saw all those little
bottles and l made an assumption...

221
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:38,048
...which l know we're never
supposed to do.

222
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:39,918
I'm really sorry.

223
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:48,920
Those guys were drinking out
of a rented refrigerator, a mini-fridge.

224
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:52,089
-That's it?
-Yeah.

225
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:55,667
-The rest of the piece is solid?
-Well, yeah, of course.

226
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:59,206
Go home, Steve.
Your resignation will not be required.

227
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:03,078
-Really? You're not mad?
-Of course not.

228
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:08,381
-Do you want my notes?
-Have a good night.

229
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,553
Thanks, Michael.

230
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,386
Thanks for backing me.

231
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,921
it's what editors do.

232
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,060
Good night.

233
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,418
Hi. Front desk, please.

234
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,554
Hi, l need some information.

235
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,856
Do the suites at your hotels
have minibars?

236
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,197
Well, can a guest
rent something like that...

237
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,700
...like a mini-refrigerator
or something?

238
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:04,435
They can.

239
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,766
Okay, thank you very much.

240
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,546
She says, ''l didn't invite
Vernon Jordan that evening...

241
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,739
...because my guests of honor
were girls from Smith College.

242
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,943
Some of them were virgins,
and l wanted to keep it that way.''

243
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:21,553
You're gonna put that
in the article, right?

244
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,281
Gosh, Alec, l don't know.

245
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,325
l mean, you know, George is such
a dignified publication.

246
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,621
You wouldn't want something
that gossipy?

247
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,799
No. Absolutely not.

248
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,125
Of course I'm putting it in.

249
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:37,533
Thank you, Stephen. You're going
to make me look very, very smart.

250
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,501
The Fritos are running
dangerously low. I'll be right back.

251
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:47,109
You can't hide in here all night, Ames.

252
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,914
Can l ask you something?

253
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,913
What is this? l found it in the freezer.

254
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,127
You said you hated how
the Diet Coke at parties...

255
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,023
...was always at room temperature.

256
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,960
How if you wanted it cold,
you'd have to put it on ice.

257
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,566
Then it would get too watery.
Don't you remember?

258
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:11,035
Yeah, l do, but l said that
a couple of years ago.

259
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:16,376
Steve, I'm gonna call it a night,
but thanks for having me.

260
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:19,945
-Thanks for coming.
-Alphabetized beer. That's perfect.

261
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,649
Drive safe, Alec.

262
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,287
-Who's he?
-Associate editor of George.

263
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:28,920
When did you start talking to George?

264
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:30,955
I'm really not.

265
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:34,461
it's probably nothing.

266
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,363
lf they stoop any lower...

267
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:39,557
...soon there won't be a difference
between Time and People.

268
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:42,931
You say that like there is a difference
between Time and People.

269
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:45,800
-Exactly.
-Thank you, Steve.

270
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,411
What?

271
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:54,013
GEORGETOWN UNlVERSITY
LAW CENTER

272
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:56,984
Are you mad at me?

273
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,814
l told you, l do not respond to,
''Are you mad at me?''

274
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:01,717
I'm not your kindergarten teacher.

275
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:04,392
We've been over this
a thousand times already.

276
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,458
You can't go to law school.

277
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:09,153
You don't wanna
go to law school, remember?

278
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:13,233
l know. it's only nights. l wouldn't
have to stop working or anything.

279
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:17,531
-I'll just put these down. I'll be back.
-No! l wanna talk about this.

280
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,510
l told you, it's my parents, okay?
They never shut up about it.

281
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,179
lf l don't go,
they won't let me be a journalist.

282
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,077
''Let you''?
You're 24 years old, Stephen.

283
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:32,617
You don't know how things go where l
grew up, Caitlin. There are rules there.

284
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,355
lf your son's not a doctor or lawyer,
you're nothing.

285
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:39,254
You're writing for The New fucking
Republic. isn't that good enough?

286
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,753
Not in Highland Park.

287
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:46,758
-I'm sorry, l--
-Stop apologizing for everything.

288
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:50,200
l was looking through your mail.
You should be pissed at me.

289
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:54,271
-I'm not.
-You're gonna throw this out, right?

290
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,473
l can't. I'm sorry.

291
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,552
Every station on the radio
is talking about it:

292
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:06,618
Mike Tyson biting Evander Holyfield.

293
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:10,120
And these are supposed
to be news stations.

294
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:14,284
So on Tuesday l started calling a few,
and finally l got through to one...

295
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,863
...a Bible talk station in Kentucky.

296
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:22,230
l managed to convince the screener
that l was a behavioral psychologist...

297
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:26,704
...who specializes
in human-on-human biting.

298
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:31,807
l told the guy I'd done all this
extensive research...

299
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:35,177
...on people who chomp flesh
under extreme stress.

300
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:36,976
What did they say?

301
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:39,950
They put me on the air.
l took calls for 45 minutes.

302
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,520
Oh, my God.

303
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,754
Where does he find these people?

304
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,359
it's kind of stupid, l know. it's silly.
I'll probably just kill it.

305
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,267
-That mean you'll help me with it?
-Why, do you have finals this week?

306
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:07,074
Okay, moving right along. Chuck.
What do you have for us?

307
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,912
That's a bit of a hard act to follow.

308
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:19,922
Very hard act to follow. Okay....

309
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,960
I'm starting the piece on Haiti...

310
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,432
...and I'll be going to....

311
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:29,768
Don't let me interrupt.

312
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,372
-Hey, Marty.
-Michael.

313
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,882
I'm gonna be going down to
Port-au-Prince for a few days.

314
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:45,084
Marty Peretz. Our boss.

315
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,815
He's a little scary.

316
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,937
How about the commas in dates?
Are we supposed to circle those too?

317
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:08,336
Let's just get this done, okay?

318
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,272
What the hell is this?

319
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:19,085
Marty told us to circle
all the commas in the last issue...

320
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,347
...to show us
how we used them improperly.

321
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,519
-What?
-He said they should appear in pairs.

322
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,921
Apparently, the issue
is rife with errors.

323
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,029
-Rife.
-That's what he said.

324
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:30,865
l see.

325
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,766
I'm not angry, Marty,
I'm embarrassed for you.

326
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:38,337
These people work gruelling hours
for meager pay.

327
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,837
They deserve a thank you...

328
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:43,170
...not another one of your
world-famous tantrums.

329
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,741
I'd resign before I'd let you bully
them like that again, and l will.

330
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,645
Do you understand that?

331
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,612
Okay. Thank you.

332
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,196
The great comma debate is history...

333
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:07,391
...so we can all go back to work.

334
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:16,406
There are good editors, there are
bad editors. You'll have both.

335
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:20,109
My hope for you, though,
is that once...

336
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,307
...at least once,
you get a truly great one.

337
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,045
A great editor defends his writers...

338
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,783
...against anyone.
He stands up and fights for you.

339
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:37,791
Michael Kelly was that kind of editor.
He had that kind of courage.

340
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,666
And that's what hung him.

341
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:55,546
-Hello?
-Chuck, it's Marty Peretz.

342
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,651
-Got a minute?
-Of course, how are you?

343
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,151
I'm in a bit
of an uncomfortable situation...

344
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,823
...and l thought you
might be able to help me out.

345
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,459
-Sure.
-it's about Mike.

346
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:10,925
He and l-- it hasn't been working
out for some time now, as you know.

347
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:15,001
The tone of the magazine,
l think it's gotten too nasty.

348
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,865
it's strayed from the traditions
that make it great...

349
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,837
...and I'm gonna be making a change.

350
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,237
l see.

351
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:26,710
I'd like you to step in for him, Chuck.
I'd like you to become editor.

352
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:28,276
Editor?

353
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:31,543
There's a catch, of course.
Mike doesn't know any of this yet.

354
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:33,983
it'll be two or three days
before l tell him.

355
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:37,556
it'll have to remain between us
till then. Would that be a problem?

356
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,920
-Mike's a friend.
-l appreciate that, Chuck.

357
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:43,495
But l can't remove him until l know
who will be his replacement...

358
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:47,499
...for continuity's sake.
So this is how it has to be.

359
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:51,068
I'm gonna have to think about this
and discuss it with Catarina.

360
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,002
Of course, of course. Listen--

361
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:57,542
Marty, have you thought about the
impact this might have on the staff?

362
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:02,279
-He's earned a lot of loyalty there.
-Mostly by fighting with me.

363
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:05,112
The point is, l haven't earned
that kind of loyalty--

364
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,585
I'll be in New York tomorrow.
We'll go over all this in detail.

365
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,088
-Will you call me at the hotel?
-Yeah.

366
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:15,229
l really appreciate this, Chuck,
your discretion.

367
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,399
-Night.
-Night, Marty.

368
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:25,965
So l just got off the phone with Marty...

369
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:29,371
...and I've been fired,
effective immediately.

370
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:33,613
I'm to be out of the building by 5 p.m.

371
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:38,481
Chuck Iane has been chosen
to replace me.

372
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:58,437
Chuck is not an editor.
He's barely even a writer.

373
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,801
There's no way I'll be able
to work for him.

374
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,874
We should have seen this coming.

375
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:06,275
The way he laughs whenever Marty
tells a joke in the meetings.

376
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,473
They're never funny,
but there's Chuck, completely howling.

377
00:26:10,018 --> 00:26:13,454
-He's so political.
-And stiff. And humorless.

378
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:18,217
And how pissy does he get when you
try to fact-check one of his pieces?

379
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:21,554
I'm sorry, but we have an obligation
to get our facts straight.

380
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,526
Okay, let's not overdo it.

381
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:27,793
This is still a great magazine. it's still
an important magazine, and...

382
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,938
-...Monday morning he'll be running it.
-I'm gonna barf.

383
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:34,341
All right, let me get out of here, okay?

384
00:27:03,738 --> 00:27:07,174
Well, l just want
to thank you all again. Truly.

385
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:15,741
I've loved every second of this.

386
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,353
-Good luck, Mike.
-You too, Chuck.

387
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,974
Hi.

388
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,080
Hi.

389
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:50,307
-Hey.
-Hi.

390
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,750
I'm sorry about what happened
when he left.

391
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:59,819
l just didn't know what to do.

392
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:01,953
Thanks.

393
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,221
You need a hand with the boxes,
I'll be in my office.

394
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:09,761
So Chuck took over.

395
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:14,897
And the job, for the first time ever,
began to feel like a job.

396
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:16,934
But I'm being unfair.

397
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:20,767
The truth is l wrote 14 pieces while
Chuck was editing the magazine.

398
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:24,104
And the last of them
was the biggest story l ever wrote.

399
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,540
is anyone interested in hackers?

400
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,275
Because l met this kid
named Ian Restil.

401
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:33,477
Biggest computer geek of all time.

402
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,385
He hacked his way into the database
of a company called Jukt Micronics...

403
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:41,688
...and posted naked pictures of women
and the salary of all Jukt employees...

404
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,921
...on Jukt's website with a note saying:

405
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:48,091
''The Big Bad Bionic Boy
has been here, baby!''

406
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:49,292
Outstanding!

407
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,597
Jukt decided it'd be cheaper
to hire him...

408
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,741
...as a security consultant
than to try to stop him.

409
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:59,141
They met with him at the hotel where
the National Hackers Conference was.

410
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:04,143
it was the chairman from Jukt, Restil,
Restil's mother and Restil's agent.

411
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,716
-No.
-Yes. Hackers have agents too.

412
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:09,890
l was at the table with these guys.

413
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:13,189
Restil's just laying out
all of his demands.

414
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,453
l want a Miata.

415
00:30:14,662 --> 00:30:17,893
-l want a trip to Disney World.
-l want X-Men comic book #1.

416
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,158
l want a lifetime subscription
to Playboy.

417
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:21,960
And throw in Penthouse.

418
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,001
They're complying with every word.

419
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:26,400
Excuse me, sir.
Pardon me for interrupting.

420
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,441
We can arrange more money
so you can buy the comic book.

421
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:32,636
And when you're of a more
appropriate age...

422
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:37,341
...you can buy the car and
pornographic magazines on your own.

423
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:44,919
Cool.

424
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,993
After they have the meeting...

425
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:53,031
...he goes back into the conference,
where all the hackers have gathered.

426
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:56,465
And they're treating him
like he's a rock star.

427
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:09,047
Then Restil jumps up on a table,
and he's like:

428
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,115
l want a Miata!

429
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:15,054
And he's gyrating his hips like this:
''l want a Miata!

430
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:18,953
l want my Playboys!
l want a trip to Disney World!

431
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,787
Show me the money!

432
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,321
Show me the money!''

433
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:33,867
Turns out there are now 21 states
considering versions of a law called...

434
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:37,238
...the Uniform Computer Security Act,
which would criminalize...

435
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:41,142
...immunity deals between hackers
and the companies they've torched.

436
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:45,217
Meanwhile, Restil's agent claims
a client list of over 300...

437
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,550
...one of whom was once paid
a million dollars and a monster truck.

438
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:53,217
That's unbelievable.

439
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:59,364
it's really silly, l know.

440
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,495
I'm not even sure if I'm gonna finish it.

441
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,403

Wednesday, May 6, 1998

444
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Shit.

445
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:36,394
-You rang?
-Yes, l rang.

446
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,803
Why didn't you get this?

447
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:53,153
Yeah...

448
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:55,117
...that....

449
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:57,223
l don't know.

450
00:32:57,425 --> 00:33:00,053
Ian Restil - Jim Ghort
''Big Bad Bionic Boy''

451
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:03,958
Nevada law-enforcement officials
big-time software firm - called Jukt

452
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,991
Jukt Micronics - Search

453
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:14,603
There were no matches
for ''Jukt Micronics''

454
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:30,080
Hey?

455
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,058
Hey.

456
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:36,121
is it pronounced ''juked'' or ''jukked''?

457
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:40,223
it's pronounced
''give me back my article.''

458
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,292
Dang.

459
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:49,301
Adam, can you give a man a minute?

460
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,445
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

461
00:33:55,683 --> 00:34:00,950
it's just that this New Republic piece
is a fucking sieve.

462
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:04,247
l checked on Jukt Micronics...

463
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,087
...which is supposedly
a major company in California.

464
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,458
l went through every search engine
on the web. No matches found.

465
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,963
So l called 411,
every area code in the state.

466
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,931
There's no listing
for a company called Jukt Micronics.

467
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,537
Tried the
California Tax Franchise Board.

468
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,369
There's no record of taxes ever being
paid by a company called Jukt.

469
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:25,910
Tried the state comptroller's office.
No license was applied for...

470
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:27,945
...by a company using that name.

471
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,844
l called all the hackers l know...

472
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:33,179
...asking if any had heard of a National
Assembly of Hackers...

473
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:35,515
...or of a hacker named
Big Bad Bionic Boy.

474
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:37,850
Nothing. l even tried
Ian Restil himself.

475
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,256
There's no listing for the kid in D.C.,
Virginia, Maryland....

476
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:44,625
There's no record of him
ever attending a public school before.

477
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,265
-More?
-Please.

478
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,664
This guy, Joe Hiert, was described
by Glass as a former basketball agent.

479
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:53,602
No one by that name was ever
registered with the NBA.

480
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:55,605
And none of my hackers knew of him.

481
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,973
Look, l even checked the names
of every government--

482
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,011
l was just getting some coffee.

483
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,449
l checked names of every
government employee quoted...

484
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:11,989
...against a book listing the names of
all government employees in the U.S.

485
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,923
None of the Glass sources were listed.

486
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,195
-But there is one thing that checks out.
-What's that?

487
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,700
There does appear to be a state
in the Union named Nevada.

488
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:26,237
Stephen Glass

489
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:28,568
David, for Chrissakes.

490
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,607
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Stephen.

491
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:35,010
l just wanted to see if you'd read it yet,
and it was sitting right here.

492
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:38,945
-Don't hate me, okay?
-Stephen, you shredded it.

493
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:44,484
I'm trying to spare you
a spanking, David.

494
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:47,490
You've got blind quotes
all over the place.

495
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:49,663
Your facts are shaky. l mean...

496
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:53,630
...the line about the turnover at DOT
was low by 4.5 percent. l checked.

497
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,865
Of course you did.

498
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,172
Rob and Aaron would kill you
over that kind of stuff.

499
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,475
This is The New Republic,
remember? Nothing slides here.

500
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:05,339
lf you don't have it cold,
you don't turn it in, ever.

501
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:07,104
-Okay.
-Look...

502
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:09,783
...bring me your notes later.
We'll go through it.

503
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,214
There's a lot about it that l liked.

504
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,354
-Really?
-Really.

505
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,153
And get back to work, okay?
The mailroom floor needs scrubbing.

506
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,089
Okay. Hey, thanks, Stephen.

507
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:33,935
You have one unheard message.
First message.

508
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:37,168
Hi, Stephen, this is Adam Penenberg
from Forbes Digital Tool.

509
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:40,541
l just got done reading
your hacker article.

510
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:45,344
First of all, congratulations.
l mean, everybody here just loved it.

511
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:49,455
But we wanted to do a companion
piece to it, sort of a day-two story...

512
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:53,991
...and I'm having some trouble
tracking down Ian Restil.

513
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:57,024
You think l could get
a phone number on him from you?

514
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:00,459
Look, l think it's good
that you tried this.

515
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:02,700
it's good to stretch.

516
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:04,462
l just....

517
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,337
l don't think you're writing
to your strengths.

518
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,835
-Can l...?
-l mean....

519
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,844
l wonder why you'd wanna stray
from the things you do so well.

520
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:29,592
Have you noticed the way Steve's
phone has been ringing lately?

521
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:32,925
Did you see all those editors
at the correspondents dinner?

522
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:36,365
-The way they were circling him?
-is that what you want, Amy?

523
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:40,203
To get a bunch of smoke blown
up your ass by a pack of editors?

524
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:43,605
Yes. Yes, it is.

525
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,104
Caitlin...

526
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:51,251
...he's going to double his salary
freelancing like that.

527
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:53,613
These guys don't want
policy pieces anymore.

528
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:57,552
They want color.
They want nuance, humor.

529
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:59,385
Amy...

530
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,193
...you don't write funny.

531
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,499
it's a little funny.

532
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:11,466
isn't it?

533
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:15,936
-l was just looking for Stephen.
-He's in his office.

534
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:27,281
-You got a minute, Steve?
-Yeah.

535
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,979
You have numbers for your sources
on ''Hack Heaven''?

536
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:31,385
But they're at home.

537
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:33,253
-Can l get them?
-Of course.

538
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:36,055
Did l do something wrong?
Are you mad at me?

539
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,858
No, l just need the phone numbers.

540
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:42,635
Okay.

541
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:46,462
Okay. Okay, I'm trying to keep cool
about all this.

542
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:50,940
But you know the Uniform Computer
Security Act in the Glass piece?

543
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:54,342
Supposed to be under debate
in 21 state legislatures?

544
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:57,143
l just checked all 50. No such act.

545
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,753
-Beautiful.
-And Julie Farthwork...

546
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:03,583
...from the Computer Security Center?
Not too sure she exists either.

547
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:08,321
Same with Jim Ghort of the Center
for interstate Online investigations.

548
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:13,626
And I've got nothing on the National
Assembly of Hackers or Frank Juliet.

549
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,460
-Man.
-Do you know why this is so great?

550
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:17,898
Do you see the irony?

551
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,768
The snobbiest rag in the business,
in-flight magazine of Air Force One...

552
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:24,536
...and their star goes
and gets completely snowed...

553
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,474
...by a bunch of hackers.

554
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,945
God couldn't have written this
any better.

555
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:38,284
-Adam?
-Yeah?

556
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:45,264
Long as I'm grinding away on this,
any chance you'd share your byline?

557
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:51,198
Forget it.

558
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:56,541
We are in uncharted
territory here, Adam.

559
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:59,542
An online magazine
going after a giant.

560
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:04,642
You should have someone beside you
to take some flak in case it blows up.

561
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:08,879
-Gosh, that's touching.
-You're completely swamped.

562
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,548
-You're behind on the Polese piece.
-I'll get to it.

563
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,558
Look, everything
that I'm working on is so...

564
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,790
...dull.

565
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:21,763
-And this is spectacular.
-Andy, no.

566
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:24,231
it's not like you found
this story yourself.

567
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:25,905
Kambiz just handed it to you.

568
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,370
lf l hadn't been at the dentist,
it'd be me about to get famous.

569
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:32,569
Why don't you just
share the wealth, okay? Shit.

570
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:40,576
That came out a lot uglier
than l meant it. Sorry.

571
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,822
-Hey.
-Hey.

572
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,596
Well, Ian Restil
e-mailed me right back.

573
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,199
it might be tough to put you
in touch directly...

574
00:40:54,402 --> 00:40:58,031
...or at least until next week.
This is his email:

575
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,369
''Your story screwed up my deal.
l don't to talk to you.''

576
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:04,806
l think he meant
''don't want to talk to you.''

577
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:08,778
''I'm on vacation with my parents,
so leave me alone.''

578
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:13,283
What kind of parent goes on vacation
with their kid in early May?

579
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:17,750
That's a good question.
l guess you have to know his mom.

580
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,983
She's a little quirky.

581
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:24,961
That's his email address
if you want to write him yourself.

582
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,632
These are all my notes.

583
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:31,736
That's for the
National Assembly of Hackers.

584
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:36,308
Don't be thrown if all you hear is like
a dark, deep, heavy breathing. it's--

585
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,138
l don't know, their outgoing
voice-mail message.

586
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:40,904
Don't ask me why.

587
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:43,810
And then that's the number
for Jukt Micronics.

588
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,849
The chairman's name is George Sims.

589
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:50,149
l can't figure why this Penenberg guy
would have such a hard time finding it.

590
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:51,688
But you know, whatever.

591
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,325
That's the URL to their website.

592
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:57,062
And then l can't seem to find
Joe Hiert's number.

593
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,788
l was looking all over at home.

594
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,365
it's somewhere, l know.
I'll get that tomorrow.

595
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,503
-lf that's okay.
-Sure.

596
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:06,230
He's Restil's agent.

597
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,431
Should l...? I'll give you some privacy.

598
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:11,042
No, have a seat.
650, is that Palo Aito?

599
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:14,180
No, Silicon Valley.

600
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,849
You'll probably get a voice mail.
l usually do.

601
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,281
You've reached the offices
of Jukt Micronics.

602
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:21,318
Please leave a message.

603
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:24,685
it's Charles Lane from The New
Republic in Washington D.C.

604
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:27,360
I'd like to speak to George Sims,
if l could.

605
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,495
They already have our number.

606
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,956
l guess you already have our number.
Thank you.

607
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:36,796
I'm sorry.
We've just spoken a million times now.

608
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:39,404
it's actually his voice
on the answering machine.

609
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:40,801
Sims is so hands-on...

610
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:44,444
...that he won't even let his secretary
do an outgoing message.

611
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:50,016
-Who's next?
-Penenberg.

612
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,555
-This is Adam.
-Hi, it's Chuck Lane.

613
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,820
-Hi, Chuck.
-I've got a phone number for you.

614
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:02,460
-A phone number for what?
-For George Sims at Jukt Micronics.

615
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,655
-You got a pen?
-Yeah, sure.

616
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,002
Okay, thanks.

617
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:16,668
it's a phone number
for Jukt Micronics.

618
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,420
You've reached the offices
of Jukt Micronics.

619
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,593
Please leave a message.

620
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,535
Do me a favor.

621
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:51,643
Call this number
the same time l do, okay?

622
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:57,281
Ready? Go.

623
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:04,419
You've reached the offices
of Jukt Micronics.

624
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,887
Please leave a message.

625
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:08,218
-What'd you get?
-it's a voice mail.

626
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:11,457
l get a busy signal. Hang up.

627
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:15,431
Try again, okay? Redial.

628
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:22,632
-Busy signal.
-l got a voice mail. Hang up.

629
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,316
A major software company
with one phone line?

630
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,486
-How you doing?
-Good.

631
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:39,920
He's up to 103.

632
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:41,924
Oh, shit.

633
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:44,622
Come here, buddy.

634
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:48,899
-Should l give him a bath?
-That would be great.

635
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,536
Yeah.

636
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:53,439
How you doing?

637
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,369
-Hello?
-Hello, this is George Sims.

638
00:44:57,578 --> 00:45:01,674
-May l speak with Charles Lane?
-One moment, please.

639
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:05,542
Honey, it's George Sims.

640
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:09,647
I'll take him.

641
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:12,985
Come on, sweetheart. Yes, yes, yes.

642
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,956
-Oh, you're such a good boy.
-Hello?

643
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,293
Yeah, this is George Sims from Jukt.

644
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:19,363
Am l speaking with Charles Lane?

645
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:22,194
Mr. Sims, thank you
for calling me back--

646
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:26,567
l don't have time for this, actually.
We're trying to have an office party.

647
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:30,672
Look, if you were calling
for a comment on your story...

648
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:35,042
...l don't have one other than to say
l wish you never ran the stupid thing.

649
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:39,886
That stuff was off the record, and your
reporter knows it. That Glass guy.

650
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,250
-I'm calling to verify information.
-I'm not verifying anything.

651
00:45:43,457 --> 00:45:47,416
Bottom line is I'd like you guys
to basically get lost, okay?

652
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:49,987
Hello?

653
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:54,766
-Hey.
-David.

654
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:57,199
-Oh, I'm sorry, Steve.
-Shit.

655
00:45:57,404 --> 00:46:00,430
l didn't mean to startle you.
Thought you'd like some coffee.

656
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:03,769
-What are you doing here?
-Working late. Working on my article.

657
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:06,276
-So l don't get shredded again.
-Thank you.

658
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,109
You're welcome.
So l always forget to ask you :

659
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:12,410
How are your studies coming?

660
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:15,348
They're fine. I'm just buried.

661
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:19,458
You're buried. Right. Okay,
l should probably let you get back to it.

662
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,118
-is there anything else you need?
-No. Good night, David.

663
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,430
All right. Night, Steve.

664
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:35,097
l got it.

665
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:40,137
-Hello?
-Chuck, it's Steve.

666
00:46:41,348 --> 00:46:44,215
-Hi, Steve.
-Hey, sorry to be calling so late.

667
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:47,148
l was just wondering,
did you get a call...

668
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:51,085
-...from the Jukt guy, George Sims?
-l did, yeah.

669
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:54,351
Yeah, l was sitting here,
and l realized that I'd given him...

670
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:59,396
...your home number without asking
you first, and l wanted to apologize.

671
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,223
it's fine.

672
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:03,001
Sort of a prick, you think?

673
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,761
l couldn't really tell,
because he hung up so fast.

674
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:08,068
Are you at home, Steve?

675
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:11,244
-No, why?
-l left a message on your machine.

676
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:14,278
The Forbes guys want to talk
to us again.

677
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,449
There's a conference call at 9 a.m.

678
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:18,409
Sure. Sounds like a party.

679
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,610
Yeah.

680
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,653
-Okay. Night, Chuck.
-See you in the morning.

681
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:32,090
That's weird.

682
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:00,217
Friday, May 8, 1998

683
00:48:04,765 --> 00:48:08,360
THE NEW REPUBLlC

684
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,837
-Morning.
-Hey.

685
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:21,714
-Want a laugh?
-Sure.

686
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:24,577
-The website for Jukt Micronics.
-Oh, good.

687
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:27,583
Yeah, you might not think so
when you see what's on it.

688
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,892
l don't think Mr. Sims
liked our piece that much.

689
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:37,387
it is with great frustration that we read
the article ''Hack Heaven''....

690
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:44,468
And l found this, too,
on my fridge for some reason.

691
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,038
Ian Restil's agent, Joe Hiert.

692
00:48:57,384 --> 00:48:59,181
JOE HlERT
Super-Agent to Super-Nerds

693
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:02,219
I'd like to pause.
You can't really go into journalism...

694
00:49:02,422 --> 00:49:06,449
...without first understanding how a
piece gets edited at a place like TNR.

695
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,788
This is the system Michael Kelly
brought from The New Yorker...

696
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:11,726
...a three-day torture test.

697
00:49:11,932 --> 00:49:14,298
lf your article's good,
it'll make it better.

698
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:18,332
lf your article's shaky,
you're in for a long week.

699
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,105
A story comes in,
and it goes to a senior editor.

700
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:23,469
He or she edits it on computer...

701
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:25,941
...then calls in the writer
to make revisions.

702
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:29,377
Then it goes to a second editor,
and the writer revises it again.

703
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:32,245
Then it goes through a fact-check,
where every fact...

704
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:37,048
...every date, every title, every place
or assertion is checked and verified.

705
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:40,784
Then it goes to a copy editor,
where it is scrutinized once again.

706
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:43,895
Then it goes to lawyers
who apply their burdens of proof.

707
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:45,291
Marty looks at it too.

708
00:49:45,499 --> 00:49:48,024
He's concerned with any comment
the magazine makes.

709
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,999
Then production lays it out
in column inches and type.

710
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:54,971
Then it goes back on paper, back to
the writer, back to the copy editor...

711
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:57,370
...back to editor one and editor two...

712
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:01,981
...back to the fact-checker, back to the
writer and back to production again.

713
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:04,275
Throughout, the lawyers read
and re-read...

714
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:07,647
...looking for red flags,
anything that feels uncorroborated.

715
00:50:07,854 --> 00:50:11,449
Once they're satisfied, the pages
are reprinted, and it happens again.

716
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:16,292
Every editor, the fact-checkers,
they all go through it one last time.

717
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:21,191
Now, most of you will start out
as interns somewhere...

718
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:25,667
...and interns do a lot of fact-checking,
so pay close attention.

719
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:31,337
There's a hole in the fact-checking
system, a big one.

720
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:34,507
The facts of most pieces
can be checked...

721
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:36,910
...against some type
of source material.

722
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,108
lf an article's on ethanol subsidies...

723
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:41,981
...you can check against
the congressional record...

724
00:50:42,189 --> 00:50:47,286
...trade publications, LexisNexis,
footage from C-SPAN.

725
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:49,988
But on other pieces...

726
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:53,356
...the only source material available...

727
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,230
...are the notes provided
by the reporter himself.

728
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:59,698
Steve.

729
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:03,565
This doesn't look
like a real business card to me.

730
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,071
Yeah, l know.
That's the kind of clown this guy is.

731
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:09,408
He won't even pay
to have real cards made.

732
00:51:10,684 --> 00:51:12,413
All right.

733
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:16,947
-My office at 9, okay?
-Yeah.

734
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:23,255
Good morning.

735
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:26,396
A few others we can't seem to locate:

736
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:31,864
Julie Farthwork, Frank Juliet and
Ian Restil's agent, Joe Hiert.

737
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:34,870
We called the numbers you gave us
and got voice mails.

738
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:39,011
And the e-mails were sent back
no address or account closed.

739
00:51:39,212 --> 00:51:42,477
Really? Because I've e-mailed them
about a million times each.

740
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,116
Hiert's online all day long.

741
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:45,945
Did you ever get them directly?

742
00:51:46,153 --> 00:51:49,520
No. l always left messages and spoke
to them when they called back.

743
00:51:49,723 --> 00:51:54,057
And the references in the article to
Nevada law-enforcement officials....

744
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:55,888
You only spoke to Jim Ghort?

745
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:57,791
-Yes.
-You have a number for him?

746
00:51:57,998 --> 00:51:59,556
-Yeah, definitely.
-By the way...

747
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:04,794
...what was your basis for writing that
Jukt was a big time software company?

748
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:07,337
l didn't. That was added
by the copy desk.

749
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,704
Was the hackers conference where
you met the Jukt executives--?

750
00:52:10,911 --> 00:52:14,711
That part of the article is misleading.
l was never in the Restils' home.

751
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,008
You weren't there
with the Jukt executives?

752
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,310
No. l didn't mean to imply
that l had been.

753
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:29,054
Sorry about that.
Did the fax come through okay?

754
00:52:29,463 --> 00:52:31,431
Yes, it did.

755
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:34,667
l think the address was garbled.
We can't find the site.

756
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:36,733
-You wanna read it back to me?
-Sure.

757
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:41,431
You gave us,
''members.aol.juktn.html.''

758
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:43,939
-Wait. Was that an M?
-I'm sorry?

759
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:46,271
After ''Jukt,'' was that an M
as in ''Micronics''?

760
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,110
No, it was an N, as in ''not working.''

761
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,683
-Try M.
-Okay.

762
00:52:54,888 --> 00:52:58,654
-Sorry about that, l was just rushing.
-Of course.

763
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,589
But l do find myself
wondering, Stephen...

764
00:53:01,795 --> 00:53:04,525
...why would a major software
company put their site...

765
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:08,258
...where only AOL members access it,
as opposed to the entire web?

766
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:10,060
l have no idea.

767
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,500
l don't have a site.
l don't know about them.

768
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:15,004
l would trust you guys
know better than me.

769
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,838
Okay.

770
00:53:18,044 --> 00:53:22,447
Looks like we have the Jukt website
up now.

771
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:26,278
Jukt Micronics

772
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:37,053
l have to say, Stephen,
this looks very suspicious to me.

773
00:53:38,064 --> 00:53:42,000
-How so?
-Quite frankly, it doesn't look real.

774
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:45,865
it looks like a site
that was created to fool someone.

775
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,775
l don't know much.
Could they do that?

776
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,442
-Of course.
-Very easily.

777
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,509
So easy, in fact, it's incredible.

778
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:55,143
Do you still want that number
for Jim Ghort?

779
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,441
Because l just found it in my notes.

780
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,312
Yeah, sure.

781
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,784
-All right. 605-84--
-Oh, wait.

782
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,581
Sorry?

783
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:07,151
605, that's not Nevada.

784
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:23,602
l guess l got him mixed up
with another source.

785
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:33,814
Sorry about that one.

786
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,248
Oh, you know what it was?

787
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:40,154
Jim Ghort was the guy who told me
about the law-enforcement officials.

788
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:43,722
l don't know what l was thinking.

789
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,364
-I'm gonna have to get you that--
-Steve.

790
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,165
Give him the number.

791
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:58,376
This guy is toast.

792
00:54:58,578 --> 00:55:01,479
All right, Stephen, in light of all this...

793
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:04,047
...how confident are you
in this story of yours?

794
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,247
Are we off the record?

795
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,380
-lf you like.
-Well...

796
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,261
...off the record...

797
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,160
...some of the things
that you've brought up...

798
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:21,558
...the website...

799
00:55:21,768 --> 00:55:25,704
...the idea that l was always speaking
to these people through voice mail....

800
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,271
That is, that they were
always calling me....

801
00:55:31,444 --> 00:55:34,504
it didn't seem strange before,
but clearly there are problems.

802
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:35,908
You've pointed them out.

803
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:39,182
One portion of it was structured
in a way that....

804
00:55:42,822 --> 00:55:46,656
l just, well, in light of all this....

805
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:57,063
it's just I'm increasingly beginning
to believe that I've been duped.

806
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:08,714
So we hang up after he's basically let
these guys interrogate me for an hour.

807
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:13,711
And l go, ''Chuck, what happened?
l mean, why didn't you back me up?''

808
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,981
And he goes, ''I'm sorry, Steve. l gotta
protect the magazine. I'm the editor.''

809
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:20,450
-Typical.
-He's being such an asshole.

810
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:23,225
So I'm dead, pretty much.

811
00:56:25,898 --> 00:56:27,422
Yes, this is Kambiz.

812
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:30,831
Can we have a talk here,
just editor to editor?

813
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:34,400
Sure, go ahead.

814
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:38,509
Completely off the record and really
almost human being to human being?

815
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:40,244
Of course.

816
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:44,075
You guys have discovered something
that a troubled kid has done...

817
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:47,175
...but l still don't know
how you plan to play it.

818
00:56:47,387 --> 00:56:51,790
l have no interest in embarrassing
you or The New Republic.

819
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,653
I'm not worried about me
or the magazine. That's fair.

820
00:56:55,295 --> 00:57:00,927
But there's a kid here who basically
just plainly screwed up, big time.

821
00:57:01,134 --> 00:57:02,829
His reporting was sloppy, we know.

822
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:05,937
But we're trying to handle it
internally at this point.

823
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:07,970
-Just as you would.
-Listen.

824
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:13,235
We're going to run something
along the lines of a trick was pulled...

825
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:15,539
...and some hackers
created an illusion.

826
00:57:15,748 --> 00:57:20,185
l can't tell you what to print or not
to print. You guys are journalists.

827
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:23,651
But he could be very hurt
by what you guys publish. His career.

828
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,953
Chuck, l understand. l do.

829
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,958
l would hope if l made
the mistakes he made...

830
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:32,393
...people would be generous with me.

831
00:57:32,598 --> 00:57:37,467
But this concerns
the very field we cover.

832
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,864
We have to run it.

833
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:43,637
And when we do, we're gonna
need a comment from you.

834
00:57:44,677 --> 00:57:46,702
So given everything that's happened...

835
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:49,575
...how strongly are you gonna stand
behind this story?

836
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:56,752
I'm looking into it.

837
00:57:57,323 --> 00:58:00,656
it's really not that big a deal.
You got fooled by a source.

838
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,819
it happens. They'll print a retraction,
and that'll be that.

839
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:06,999
Steve, it won't hurt your career.

840
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,260
Of course, if you weren't so distracted
by your classes....

841
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,030
Yeah, l know, l really gotta quit.
You're right.

842
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:22,037
-Can l speak to you for a minute?
-What about?

843
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:24,840
Let's do it in private.

844
00:58:33,893 --> 00:58:36,453
We need to take a drive to Bethesda.

845
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:39,992
-What for?
-l wanna meet Joe Hiert.

846
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:42,133
l told you, nobody knows where he is.

847
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:46,931
Well, maybe if we go to the hotel
where he met with Restil and Sims...

848
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,701
-...someone will remember him--
-There were hundreds of people there.

849
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,969
These Forbes guys
wanna come down on you.

850
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:56,410
-This is ridiculous.
-They're very suspicious of that article.

851
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,810
-You know that.
-Yeah.

852
00:58:58,017 --> 00:59:01,646
But they're gonna go online
with their piece tomorrow.

853
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:04,015
-Okay?
-Yeah.

854
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:06,817
-Yeah.
-Now....

855
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:10,860
-Steve? Steve.
-Yeah?

856
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:14,760
lf we can find Hiert,
l can back them off for a day or two.

857
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:17,094
-Okay?
-Okay, I'll get my notes.

858
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,513
-Let's go.
-All right.

859
00:59:40,593 --> 00:59:41,787
We were at this table.

860
00:59:42,462 --> 00:59:45,920
Restil sat here. His mother
was on his left. Hiert--

861
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,726
Sorry, his mother was on his right.
Hiert sat there.

862
00:59:48,935 --> 00:59:51,699
But Restil wanted him closer,
so he slid his chair over.

863
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:54,971
Sims sat here.
He had a lawyer next to him.

864
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,541
l forget his name. it's in my notes.
Somebody smoked at this table.

865
00:59:58,744 --> 01:00:02,043
So then Restil's mother insisted
that we move to one farther away.

866
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:03,909
Over there.

867
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:07,212
The hacker conference
was near here, right?

868
01:00:08,988 --> 01:00:10,979
Yeah, the building next door.

869
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,125
l don't remember, how many people
did you say were at this?

870
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:17,660
Looked like a hundred,
might've been two. it's in my notes.

871
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,135
Two hundred people. Here.

872
01:00:28,774 --> 01:00:32,335
Yeah, they moved in and out.
l mean, most of them were kids.

873
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:51,422
That doesn't seem credible to me.

874
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:55,465
All l know is, l was here.
All of us were right here.

875
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:57,226
Excuse me, sir, can l help you?

876
01:00:57,637 --> 01:00:59,366
Yes, you can.

877
01:01:04,176 --> 01:01:07,339
We're looking into a conference
held here a couple Sundays ago.

878
01:01:07,613 --> 01:01:10,514
Computer hackers.
You remember anything like that?

879
01:01:10,716 --> 01:01:12,775
Are you sure you're
in the right building?

880
01:01:12,985 --> 01:01:14,577
-Yes, we're sure.
-Why is that?

881
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:16,379
Building's closed on Sunday.

882
01:01:21,494 --> 01:01:26,090
All l know is l was here.
The conference was right here.

883
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,335
That's why the Restils
only stayed a few minutes.

884
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:34,665
Because it was such a dumb place
to squeeze into.

885
01:01:34,874 --> 01:01:39,402
So they went to a restaurant for dinner
with some of Ian's hacker friends.

886
01:01:40,646 --> 01:01:42,170
Thank you.

887
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:46,780
How many?

888
01:01:49,522 --> 01:01:51,786
People at the dinner, how many?

889
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,987
About 10, l think, including me.

890
01:01:55,595 --> 01:01:56,994
Ian even put on a jacket.

891
01:01:57,196 --> 01:01:59,289
-Hiert was there too?
-Yeah.

892
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:02,092
-is it near here?
-Yeah, it's across the street.

893
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,326
Good. Let's cross the street.

894
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:09,273
l don't like the way you're treating me.
it's like you won't even talk to me.

895
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,375
-This is the place?
-Yes.

896
01:02:11,577 --> 01:02:13,909
l didn't do anything wrong, okay?

897
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:18,482
l didn't do anything wrong. You saw
my notes. Everything was in there.

898
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:24,818
l got tricked. l got fooled, I'm sorry.
What are you being so mad for?

899
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:27,392
-it was 10 people.
-Yes.

900
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:30,084
-For dinner.
-Yes.

901
01:02:30,296 --> 01:02:32,764
They're closed at 3 on Sundays.

902
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:36,162
Yeah, l know. l know.
They almost didn't let us in.

903
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:40,669
But it was a couple minutes before 3,
Ian looked like he was ready to cry...

904
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:43,000
-...and so they said okay.
-But for dinner?

905
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,972
Go in and ask them yourself, Chuck.

906
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:49,039
Okay, go in and see if they would
serve a party that came in at 2:58...

907
01:02:49,248 --> 01:02:50,875
...and the answer would be yes.

908
01:02:51,283 --> 01:02:52,978
Forbes is gonna have all this too.

909
01:02:53,185 --> 01:02:55,653
They'll dig through the records
of that building.

910
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,688
I'm sure they have cameras,
and they're gonna check them.

911
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:03,191
-l didn't do anything wrong, Chuck.
-l really wish you'd stop saying that!

912
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,097
Steve....

913
01:03:13,406 --> 01:03:17,467
-Anyone can make a mistake.
-You know, this is not right, Chuck.

914
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:20,202
Okay, l feel really attacked.

915
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:22,472
You're my editor.
You should support me.

916
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:25,378
And you're taking their word
against mine?

917
01:03:26,118 --> 01:03:28,916
You're supposed to support me!

918
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,261
Criticism of the president's
program has been--

919
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:40,227
Leave it off.

920
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:50,267
I'm sorry l yelled at you back there.

921
01:03:52,878 --> 01:03:54,470
Chuck?

922
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:05,852
Steve!

923
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:11,359
Pull the goddamn car over.

924
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:13,426
Yeah.

925
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:21,829
All right.

926
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,444
There's been so much pressure.

927
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,878
-l didn't mean to get anyone in trouble.
-Okay.

928
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:37,345
Okay.

929
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:41,252
You weren't at the conference.

930
01:04:43,229 --> 01:04:44,662
No.

931
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:51,667
l had a description of it from so
many sources, l thought l had it solid.

932
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,267
Okay? And l wanted the piece to have
an eyewitness feel to it for color.

933
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,308
So l said I'd been there myself.

934
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,447
And everything we told
the Forbes guys--

935
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,776
I'm so sorry, Chuck.

936
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,919
l just panicked.

937
01:05:12,258 --> 01:05:15,386
lf you want me to say
that l made it up, l will.

938
01:05:15,594 --> 01:05:17,653
lf that will help you, I'll say it.

939
01:05:19,899 --> 01:05:22,834
l just want you to tell me
the truth, Steve.

940
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:25,231
Can you do that?

941
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,234
I'm suggesting that there might be
facets that you're not considering.

942
01:05:30,442 --> 01:05:33,741
-Why are you defending him?
-Nobody's defending him, Chuck.

943
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:37,007
-Of course you're defending him.
-He's a kid.

944
01:05:37,216 --> 01:05:40,208
He doctored his notes, Lew.
Just consider that for a second.

945
01:05:40,419 --> 01:05:44,480
You know? He sat down and he
hand-wrote a bunch of phoney quotes...

946
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,818
...and he handed them in as
source material for the fact-check.

947
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,325
- Doesn't that offend you?
- Of course it does.

948
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,396
He lied to his editor.
That's supposed to offend you too.

949
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,466
He's a confused, distraught kid,
obviously, Chuck.

950
01:05:56,669 --> 01:05:59,695
So suspend him for a couple months,
but let's not bury him.

951
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:01,532
Suspend him.

952
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:06,976
There are also political considerations
to take into account here:

953
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:10,140
The rest of the staff,
the way they feel about him.

954
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,216
l already know all that.

955
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:17,515
What I'm saying is, if you fire him,
some of these people will leave.

956
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:21,689
l don't know if we'd still have a
magazine at the end of the day.

957
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:26,855
-Hey, Caitlin.
-Not now, David.

958
01:06:31,403 --> 01:06:34,304
-How's he doing?
-Well, he's a wreck, of course.

959
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:38,871
-l want him in here, Caitlin.
-He's too scared to come in here.

960
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,673
He thinks you want to destroy him.
He knows what he did was horrible.

961
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,217
He knows how badly he messed up.

962
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:48,079
The part he's most upset about
is lying to you, Chuck.

963
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:52,519
He knows you took it as a sign of
disrespect instead of as a panic move.

964
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:54,886
Think about the workload
he's been carrying.

965
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:56,526
All this and classes.

966
01:06:56,729 --> 01:06:59,289
He hasn't slept more than
two hours in nine months.

967
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:02,292
He got a little sloppy
and lied to cover his tracks.

968
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:04,526
-He's sick about it.
-Caitlin...

969
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:08,605
...the building he described,
it doesn't even exist.

970
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,575
He just made it up.

971
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,340
So....

972
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:23,748
Obviously, he needs some help.

973
01:07:26,258 --> 01:07:28,283
-He needs help.
-Just get him in here.

974
01:07:28,494 --> 01:07:30,621
You can't fire him.

975
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:35,097
l don't think he'll survive. You don't
understand, we're all he has.

976
01:07:37,002 --> 01:07:38,936
You can't fire him, Chuck.

977
01:07:42,374 --> 01:07:43,671
Thanks, Lew.

978
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,497
Would you guys excuse us
for a minute?

979
01:08:17,643 --> 01:08:20,111
Chuck isn't firing Steve...

980
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:27,012
He's just suspending him
for two years.

981
01:08:34,994 --> 01:08:37,690
l think l have to quit.
Caitlin

982
01:08:39,498 --> 01:08:41,466
SEND TO:

983
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:44,769
michael.kelly@nationaljourn

984
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,405
Sending...

985
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:59,213
--watered-down stock and,
you know, within....

986
01:09:00,252 --> 01:09:01,617
Steve.

987
01:09:08,093 --> 01:09:09,424
What are you doing here?

988
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,663
I'm so dead.

989
01:09:13,465 --> 01:09:15,228
l mean, I'm over.

990
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:19,267
Nobody's ever gonna
hire me again, are they?

991
01:09:20,873 --> 01:09:24,400
l was so sloppy,
trusting my sources like that.

992
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:28,307
And then lying about it.
And to Chuck of all people.

993
01:09:28,514 --> 01:09:33,281
l mean, the one guy
who's hated me all along.

994
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:35,780
I'm sure that it's not personal.

995
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:37,182
No?

996
01:09:38,023 --> 01:09:40,753
Chuck keeps a list in his head...

997
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:44,190
...of everybody who's
a Michael Kelly person.

998
01:09:44,396 --> 01:09:46,626
A couple of times...

999
01:09:46,832 --> 01:09:50,324
...l said some things
l shouldn't have said about you.

1000
01:09:50,536 --> 01:09:52,003
So now I'm on it.

1001
01:09:53,172 --> 01:09:55,470
That's why he's so set
on killing me now.

1002
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:58,973
Well, l have to tell you, Steve,
he's within his rights.

1003
01:09:59,178 --> 01:10:02,204
The things you did
were fireable offenses.

1004
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:05,281
l know. I'm not saying
that they weren't.

1005
01:10:06,685 --> 01:10:10,712
l did some terrible, terrible things.

1006
01:10:14,193 --> 01:10:17,219
But believe me, Michael,
Chuck doesn't care about any of it.

1007
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:21,255
it's my loyalty to you
that he's punishing me for.

1008
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,968
I'm such an idiot.

1009
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,131
Now who's gonna hire me?

1010
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,534
Steve, l have to ask you something.

1011
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,840
Did you ever cook a piece
when l was your boss?

1012
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:42,248
Did you ever lie to me?

1013
01:10:43,655 --> 01:10:47,216
The young-conservatives piece,
the mini-bottles....

1014
01:10:48,293 --> 01:10:49,590
Was that true?

1015
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,441
-Hello?
-Chuck, it's David Bach.

1016
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:13,447
I'm really sorry to bother you,
but it seemed important.

1017
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:18,716
- it's fine. is there a problem?
- Well, l don't know.

1018
01:11:18,924 --> 01:11:21,893
l just got off the phone with Stephen.
He sounds horrible.

1019
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:25,188
-Did you suspend him, Chuck?
-David....

1020
01:11:27,299 --> 01:11:28,789
What is the problem?

1021
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:32,027
He asked me if l would drive him
out to Dulles later tonight.

1022
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:34,728
He wasn't sure he'd
be safe driving by himself.

1023
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,636
l just thought l should
draw your attention to that.

1024
01:11:37,943 --> 01:11:39,535
Did he say where he was going?

1025
01:11:39,745 --> 01:11:42,475
Yeah, he said he'd be staying
with family for a while.

1026
01:11:42,681 --> 01:11:46,208
-That can be only one of two places.
-His parents live in Highland Park.

1027
01:11:46,418 --> 01:11:49,945
Yeah, or his brother out in Palo Aito.

1028
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:53,157
-I'm sorry?
-Yeah, his brother at Stanford.

1029
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:55,824
Chuck?

1030
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:16,474
You had your brother pose
as George Sims.

1031
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,179
-What?
-The phoney recording...

1032
01:12:19,384 --> 01:12:22,410
...from Jukt Micronics.
it's a Palo Aito number...

1033
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:25,215
...and your brother's at Stanford.
He posed as Sims.

1034
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,757
No, Sims is a real guy.
I've talked to him a million times.

1035
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:32,453
-My brother and l aren't speaking now.
-Stop it. You faked Sims.

1036
01:12:32,664 --> 01:12:35,724
-You faked the website, voice mails...
-You don't know, Chuck.

1037
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,368
-...Restil, Hiert, Ghort.
-You got this backwards.

1038
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:41,698
it's all crap. l can trace it.
I'll find it all billed to you--

1039
01:12:41,907 --> 01:12:44,899
What are you talking about?
Those are all real people.

1040
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,941
-They are?
-Yeah.

1041
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:50,744
Look at me...

1042
01:12:52,651 --> 01:12:53,879
...and say that again.

1043
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,181
Those are all real people.

1044
01:13:02,894 --> 01:13:04,088
Okay.

1045
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:07,895
l want you out of here.

1046
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,668
-What?
-l want you out of here.

1047
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:13,996
And you can't take anything with you.

1048
01:13:14,773 --> 01:13:17,333
There are some files.
l have to put them on a disk.

1049
01:13:17,876 --> 01:13:20,140
-No.
-No, they're mine. Personal stuff!

1050
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:21,744
l don't care.

1051
01:13:25,684 --> 01:13:26,946
l know you don't.

1052
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,844
-Can l shut down--?
-Don't!

1053
01:13:30,055 --> 01:13:31,545
I'm in the middle of a file.

1054
01:13:31,757 --> 01:13:33,588
-Goddamn it.
-Back away from the desk.

1055
01:13:33,859 --> 01:13:35,918
-Leave it, or I'll call security.
-Christ.

1056
01:13:36,128 --> 01:13:37,425
Okay?

1057
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,658
Can l take my Rolodex?

1058
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:46,798
Steve....

1059
01:13:49,608 --> 01:13:52,805
-Can l take my law books?
-Sure.

1060
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:59,877
Look, I'm gonna need to have
your security key.

1061
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:05,052
I'm not a criminal, Chuck.

1062
01:14:08,293 --> 01:14:09,692
Okay?

1063
01:14:12,564 --> 01:14:16,056
-I'm not a criminal.
-Oh, l heard you.

1064
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:17,666
Come on.

1065
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:41,318
Chuck?

1066
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:53,938
l said l was sorry.

1067
01:14:54,473 --> 01:14:55,838
l know.

1068
01:14:57,476 --> 01:14:59,068
But you have to go.

1069
01:16:01,706 --> 01:16:04,800
Bond traders, as a rule, do not have
much time to loaf around.

1070
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:07,535
And the Wall Street
investment house RVL...

1071
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:10,078
...takes its work ethic
to a particularly--

1072
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,182
One trader is now testing
a hand-held urinal...

1073
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:15,785
...normally used by cops
on stakeouts--

1074
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,453
After Mike Tyson was disqualified...

1075
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,821
...for biting Evander Holyfield,
l offered several talk shows...

1076
01:16:23,028 --> 01:16:26,520
...my services as a biting expert.
I'm someone who knows--

1077
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:29,600
The minibar is open,
and empty bottles of booze...

1078
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,792
...are scattered on the carpet--

1079
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:33,561
it was the monthly gathering...

1080
01:16:33,772 --> 01:16:36,798
...of the Commission to Restore
the Presidency to Greatness--

1081
01:16:37,008 --> 01:16:39,067
Patriotic profits
will have a hard time...

1082
01:16:39,277 --> 01:16:41,438
...holding back this
merchandising bonanza--

1083
01:16:41,646 --> 01:16:44,479
Western Union now
has a stop the Cassini hotline...

1084
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:48,517
...which forwards anti-Cassini
telegrams to the White House.

1085
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:52,884
--called ''Loving Lewinsky'' that looks
and works like a child's doll....

1086
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:04,427
-Thanks, George. Sorry for the trouble.
-No problem, Steve.

1087
01:17:19,518 --> 01:17:20,883
Chuck?

1088
01:17:27,325 --> 01:17:30,488
The thing with George Sims...

1089
01:17:31,496 --> 01:17:33,361
...that was....

1090
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:36,363
The voice you heard
on the telephone...

1091
01:17:37,636 --> 01:17:39,900
...that was my brother. I'm sorry.

1092
01:17:44,276 --> 01:17:49,043
There really is a George Sims.
I've spoken to him a million times.

1093
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:51,181
He just stopped talking to me.

1094
01:17:52,183 --> 01:17:56,085
You know, because of the article.
He was so mad about it.

1095
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:57,880
l didn't know what to do.

1096
01:17:58,089 --> 01:18:00,614
The guys from Forbes
were putting pressure on me.

1097
01:18:00,825 --> 01:18:03,316
You know? And you were so mad.

1098
01:18:03,528 --> 01:18:06,520
l just thought that if l could
get everybody off my back...

1099
01:18:06,731 --> 01:18:08,198
...okay, for just a day....

1100
01:18:09,034 --> 01:18:11,798
Just a day would give me
enough time to go and find him.

1101
01:18:12,003 --> 01:18:14,267
You can understand that, can't you?

1102
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:17,299
You're fired, Steve.

1103
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,941
What?

1104
01:18:21,212 --> 01:18:24,579
You're fired. You've lost your job.

1105
01:18:28,086 --> 01:18:29,883
But you can't--

1106
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:57,839
Chuck...

1107
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:01,642
...will you please
take me to the airport?

1108
01:19:03,054 --> 01:19:04,282
Jesus.

1109
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:06,114
Please, okay?

1110
01:19:07,459 --> 01:19:11,486
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to. it's fine.

1111
01:19:13,298 --> 01:19:15,630
But l can't be by myself right now.

1112
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:18,626
Okay? I'm....

1113
01:19:21,106 --> 01:19:22,971
I'm afraid of what I'm gonna do.

1114
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:27,434
And you know,
l can't get there by myself.

1115
01:19:30,448 --> 01:19:32,678
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1116
01:19:32,884 --> 01:19:35,876
lf you feel you're a danger to yourself,
you can sit down...

1117
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:37,884
...until you feel calm enough to go.

1118
01:19:38,089 --> 01:19:39,886
But I'm not going anywhere with you.

1119
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:45,154
But I'm afraid that I'm gonna
do something, okay?

1120
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:51,666
-Did you hear what l said?
-Yeah.

1121
01:19:53,938 --> 01:19:55,530
it's a hell of a story.

1122
01:19:59,778 --> 01:20:01,245
Chuck, please?

1123
01:20:02,681 --> 01:20:06,310
Stop pitching, Steve. it's over.

1124
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:13,317
Okay.

1125
01:20:40,118 --> 01:20:43,849
''Spring Breakdown,'' ''The Jungle''...

1126
01:20:44,055 --> 01:20:50,483
...''A Fine Mess,'' ''After the Fall,''
''Peddling Poppy''...

1127
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:56,492
...''CheapSuits,'' ''Kicked Out,''
''No Free Launch''...

1128
01:20:56,701 --> 01:21:00,364
...''Ratted Out,'' ''State of Nature,''
''Clutch Situation''...

1129
01:21:00,572 --> 01:21:05,066
...''All Wet,'' ''Plotters,''
''Praised be Greenspan''...

1130
01:21:05,276 --> 01:21:09,372
...''Monica Selis,'' ''Hack Heaven.''

1131
01:21:18,022 --> 01:21:21,822
What the hell did you do to Steve?
He just called from his car, hysterical.

1132
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:25,393
-l asked what was wrong. He said--
-l fired him, okay?

1133
01:21:31,302 --> 01:21:33,827
Not suspended, fired.

1134
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,301
This wasn't
an isolated incident, Caitlin.

1135
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:39,340
He cooked a dozen of them,
maybe more.

1136
01:21:39,944 --> 01:21:42,344
We're gonna have to go through them.
All of them.

1137
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:45,241
The only one was ''Hack Heaven.''
He told me that.

1138
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:48,442
lf he were a stranger, a guy you
were doing a piece about...

1139
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:50,951
...pretend that guy told you
he'd done it once.

1140
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:52,680
Would you take his word for it?

1141
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:55,052
Of course not.
You'd dig, and you'd bury him!

1142
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,421
You'd be offended
if anyone told you not to.

1143
01:21:57,629 --> 01:22:01,656
-All those pieces were fact-checked--
-So was ''Hack Heaven''!

1144
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,699
You're a good reporter.

1145
01:22:07,906 --> 01:22:10,204
You've always been a smart,
thorough reporter.

1146
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:12,103
Why can't you be one now?

1147
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:15,074
Because what you're telling me
is impossible, Chuck.

1148
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,641
Go upstairs.

1149
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,477
-Read them again.
-This is bullshit!

1150
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:24,280
Go all the way back, because half
of them ran when Mike was still here.

1151
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:29,249
That's what this is. Of course.

1152
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,950
What are you gonna do, Chuck?

1153
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:32,757
Pick us off one by one...

1154
01:22:32,964 --> 01:22:36,161
...everybody loyal to Mike, till you
have a staff belonging to you?

1155
01:22:36,367 --> 01:22:38,267
is that the kind of magazine
you'd run?

1156
01:22:38,469 --> 01:22:40,960
When this thing blows,
there won't be a magazine.

1157
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,269
lf you wanna make this about Mike,
l don't give a shit.

1158
01:22:44,475 --> 01:22:47,137
You can resent me, hate me,
but come Monday morning...

1159
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:50,109
...we'll all have to answer
for what we let happen here.

1160
01:22:50,315 --> 01:22:52,715
We're all gonna have
an apology to make.

1161
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:56,318
Jesus Christ! Do you have any idea
how much shit we're about to eat?

1162
01:22:56,521 --> 01:23:00,048
Every competitor.... They're gonna
pounce, and they should.

1163
01:23:00,258 --> 01:23:02,158
Because we blew it, Caitlin.

1164
01:23:03,328 --> 01:23:07,856
He handed us fiction after fiction,
and we printed them all as fact.

1165
01:23:09,033 --> 01:23:10,660
Just because...

1166
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,162
...we found him entertaining.

1167
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,033
it's indefensible.

1168
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:20,877
Don't you know that?

1169
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:40,297
Monday, May 11, 1998

1170
01:23:59,584 --> 01:24:02,052
is everyone in the conference room?

1171
01:24:05,356 --> 01:24:07,415
You know what
could've prevented all this?

1172
01:24:08,059 --> 01:24:09,390
No, what?

1173
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:12,794
Pictures.

1174
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,360
How could you make up characters...

1175
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:18,467
...if everyone you wrote about
had to be photographed?

1176
01:24:26,544 --> 01:24:31,277
You know, Stephen, if you wanted to,
you could do these kids a giant favor.

1177
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:33,746
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1178
01:24:37,288 --> 01:24:40,121
You could write something boring
one of these days.

1179
01:24:41,392 --> 01:24:44,225
Give them a little less to live up to.

1180
01:24:44,929 --> 01:24:46,590
l suppose l could.

1181
01:24:47,565 --> 01:24:51,262
l mean, we don't want a bunch of
teenagers getting ulcers, do we?

1182
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:55,862
Morning.

1183
01:25:06,484 --> 01:25:09,044
THE NEW REPUBLlC
AN APOLOG Y TO OUR READERS

1184
01:25:17,128 --> 01:25:18,891
it's funny.

1185
01:25:26,304 --> 01:25:29,068
l thought l was gonna
have to explain all this to you.

1186
01:25:32,744 --> 01:25:34,439
Well....

1187
01:25:34,645 --> 01:25:36,579
What do you think of this guy?

1188
01:25:50,862 --> 01:25:52,454
Thank you.

1189
01:25:58,036 --> 01:25:59,298
Thank you.

1190
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,147
Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.

1191
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,439
Steve?

1192
01:26:38,543 --> 01:26:40,067
Stephen?

1193
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:47,513
We've read through all the pieces
now, the entire staff.

1194
01:26:47,718 --> 01:26:50,482
And we've come up with a list
whose facts and sources...

1195
01:26:50,688 --> 01:26:52,485
...we couldn't verify independently.

1196
01:26:53,424 --> 01:26:56,484
l know you can't admit guilt
of any kind...

1197
01:26:56,861 --> 01:26:59,261
...but l want you to confirm
a few titles for me.

1198
01:26:59,697 --> 01:27:01,665
We won't confirm or deny
anything now--

1199
01:27:01,866 --> 01:27:03,424
What I'm gonna do is this:

1200
01:27:04,235 --> 01:27:08,604
I'm going to read to you a list
of suspicious titles, one by one.

1201
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,734
lf you raise an objection
to a particular title...

1202
01:27:11,943 --> 01:27:16,039
...we'll fact-check it again in the hope
of removing it from the list.

1203
01:27:16,514 --> 01:27:19,711
lf you remain silent,
we'll assume that piece is fabricated...

1204
01:27:19,917 --> 01:27:24,911
...either partially or entirely,
and it will stay on.

1205
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:27,785
is that clear to everyone?

1206
01:27:30,728 --> 01:27:32,127
Okay.

1207
01:27:33,764 --> 01:27:35,823
''Hazardous to Your Mental Health.''

1208
01:27:40,605 --> 01:27:43,233
That means it stays on the list
of suspicious pieces.

1209
01:27:43,441 --> 01:27:45,375
Fabricated pieces.

1210
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,444
We understand. Can we move along?

1211
01:27:51,582 --> 01:27:53,049
''Holy Trinity.''

1212
01:28:01,325 --> 01:28:03,384
''Probable Claus''?

1213
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,029
''Don't You D.A.R.E.''

1214
01:28:15,506 --> 01:28:16,996
''Spring Breakdown.''

1215
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,811
''State of Nature''

1216
01:28:27,084 --> 01:28:28,676
