<i>There are so many
show-offs in journalism.</i>

2
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,902
<i>So many braggarts and jerks.</i>

3
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,275
<i>They are always selling,
always working the room,</i>

4
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,645
<i>always trying to make themselves
look hotter than they actually are.</i>

5
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,242
<i>The good news is,</i>

6
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,685
<i>reporters like that make it easy
to distinguish yourself.</i>

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,916
<i>If you're
even a little bit humble,</i>

8
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,481
<i>a little self-effacing or solicitous,
you stand out.</i>

9
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,359
<i>So you bring a co-worker lunch
if he's buried under a deadline,</i>

10
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,454
<i>you remember birthdays.</i>

11
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,829
<i>It's true,
journalism is hard work,</i>

12
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,324
<i>everybody's under pressure, everybody's
grinding to get the issue out.</i>

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>Nobody's getting any sleep, but you are
allowed to smile every once in a while.</i>

14
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,670
<i>I mean, even Woodward and Bernstein
went out for a burger now and then,</i>

15
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,908
<i>and they won a Pulitzer.</i>

16
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,439
<i>Some reporters think
it's political content</i>

17
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,179
<i>that makes a story
memorable.</i>

18
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>I think it's the people
you find...</i>

19
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,719
<i>their quirks, their flaws,</i>

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,225
<i>what makes them funny,
what makes them human.</i>

21
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,660
<i>Journalism is just the art
of capturing behavior.</i>

22
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,433
<i>You have to know
who you're writing for.</i>

23
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,462
<i>And you have to know
what you're good at.</i>

24
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,474
<i>I record what people do,</i>

25
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,499
<i>I find out what moves them,
what scares them,</i>

26
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,341
<i>and I write that down.</i>

27
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,574
<i>That way, they are the ones
telling the story.</i>

28
00:01:55,615 --> 00:02:00,052

92
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,352
<i>Of course.</i>

<i>unknown to the world

<i>it appeared on the cover

Just finished the piece

106
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,164
<i>There are 16,800 magazines

107

<i>But only one calls itself "the in-flight

108

<i>Presidents, lawmakers... your work
can actually influence public policy.</i>

112
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,013
<i>That's...
that's an amazing privilege,</i>

113
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,752
<i>and a huge responsibility.</i>

114
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,521
<i>I'm sorry.

<i>the whole "journalistic
responsibility" speech... do you?</i>

116
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,199
<i>You just want to know how to get
your name in print, right?</i>

117
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,305
<i>That sounds familiar.
Okay.</i>

118
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,708
<i>Let me take you through the life
of your typical piece</i>

119
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,407
<i>so you can see
what some of the hurdles are.</i>

120
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,745
<i>We'll use one I wrote last year,</i>

121

<i>about a bunch of Young Republicans
at a Conservatives' convention.</i>

122
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,114
<i>Now, journalism is about
pursuing the truth.</i>

123
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,289
<i>And I would never encourage you
to do anything sneaky or dishonest</i>

124
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,593
<i>in pursuit of a story,
such as assuming a phony identity.</i>

125
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,334
<i>I don't know, man. It seemed like
a pretty good turnout to me.</i>

126
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,706
<i>No, man.
Conservatism is dead.</i>

127
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,938
<i>- Dead?
- We're lost.</i>

128
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,038
<i>Damn straight.</i>

129
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,141
<i>On a story like that,
your notes are crucial.</i>

130
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,709
<i>You have to record
everything you see and hear.</i>

131
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,313
<i>Every quote, every detail...</i>

132
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,824
<i>all the way down
to the mini-bottles in the fridge.</i>

133
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,656
<i>We're like this guy
who has to pee,</i>

134
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,789
<i>lost in the desert,
looking for a tree.</i>

135
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,732
<i>That's true.
Completely true.</i>

136
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,899
<i>You guys know what
you're shopping for, right?</i>

137
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,306
Yeah, totally.

138
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,336
<i>Get us a real "heifer."
The fatter the better.</i>

139
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,575
Bad acne would be a bonus.

140
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,050
<i>Let's do it!</i>

141
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,908
- Hey, Steve.

<i>Pretty standard stuff.</i>

147
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:15,303
<i>Hotel ballrooms, boring speeches.
Chicken dinners.</i>

148
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,240
<i>Which is why everybody spends
their time in the suites upstairs</i>

149
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,375
committing felonies.

150
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,784
Oh, yeah?

151
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,119
<i>Yeah. I went to one.
The ballroom was empty.</i>

152
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:35,423
<i>Every delegate under the age of 25
was on the fifth floor getting loaded.</i>

153
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,452
<i>Drugs, binge drinking,
hookers...</i>

154
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,862
<i>it gets pretty ugly.</i>

155
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,228
<i>- Sounds great, Steve.
- So does yours.</i>

156
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,100
<i>Okay, well, I gotta get back to work.
Have a good lunch.</i>

157
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,508
Thanks.

158
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,572
<i>Hold it. Have to give myself
a demerit for poor scene setting.</i>

159
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,083
<i>Let me explain. A year ago,
Chuck Lane and I were peers.</i>

160
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,279
<i>He hadn't become editor yet.</i>

161
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,447
Michael Kelly was editing
the magazine then.

162
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,323
<i>Sorry, Mrs. Duke.
I know how you feel about clarity.</i>

163
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,458
<i>We've got to start calling
some other places.</i>

164
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,629
<i>I don't think I can
eat this stuff every day.</i>

165
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,198
It was the Cannon Building.
You had it as "Russell."

166
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,368
I fixed it.

167
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,401
<i>- Thank you.
- I really liked it, Ames.</i>

168
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,175
<i>But boring, right?</i>

169
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,707
<i>No. No. I really,
really liked it.</i>

170
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,347
<i>- Ahem...
- Yes, dear?</i>

171
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,551
<i>Somebody for you on three...
someone from Harper's.</i>

172
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,617
<i>When did you start
talking to Harper's?</i>

173
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,096
<i>I'm not. It's probably nothing.
Could you send it to my voicemail?</i>

174
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,258
<i>- Very good.
- By the way, Glo',</i>

175
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,790
that lipstick is the bomb.

176
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:54,135
- Thanks, doll.
- Was it "Midnight Mist"?

177
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,511
<i>- I've really got to stop doing that.
- What?</i>

178
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,605
<i>All I do is give people
more reasons to assume I'm gay.</i>

179
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,116
<i>I mean, lately,
it's everyone.</i>

180
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,314
<i>The other night, I went out to dinner
with this guy from The Post...</i>

181
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,118
<i>- Who?
- I can't tell you, he made me promise.</i>

182
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:15,753
<i>Anyway, we're walking afterwards,
talking about Medicare for God's sakes,</i>

183
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,255
<i>the next thing I know is we're standing
on the corner of 18th and "T"...</i>

184
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,963
<i>and he somehow managed
to slip his tongue down my throat.</i>

185
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:32,203
And I'm like, "Wait a minute,
how'd this happen?"

186
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,941
<i>I don't understand.
- Neither did I.</i>

187
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,848
- Hey!
- Michael.

188
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,476
<i>- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.</i>

189
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,953
<i>We have a problem
with the "Spring Breakdown" piece.</i>

190
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,980
<i>Just got a letter from David Keene.
He ran the CPAC Conference.</i>

191
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,152
<i>- He's made...
- Are you mad at me?</i>

192
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:53,029
<i>He's made some pretty serious
charges. We need to answer them.</i>

193
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,795
<i>Okay.
My notes are at home.</i>

194
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,962
I can be back in 20 minutes.
Is that too long?

195
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,302
<i>Do your notes have anything
about the minibars? That would help.</i>

196
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,707
<i>I think so.
No, I'm sure. Why?</i>

197
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,371
<i>He claims the Omni Shoreham
doesn't even have minibars.</i>

198
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,779
- He mentioned it specifically.
- No, I saw them.

199
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,283
<i>There were little bottles
of booze all over the room.</i>

200
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,017
<i>Okay. I'll get Aaron
and Rob into it,</i>

201
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,081
<i>and start
the fact-check again.</i>

202
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,922
- I'll get my notes.
- Thank you.

203
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,259
<i>I'm sorry, we're gonna
have to finish this later.</i>

204
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,163
<i>No, no. I understand.
Thank you.</i>

205
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,738
<i>What's wrong?</i>

206
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,186
Just tell me.

207
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,745
<i>Keene was right,
Michael.</i>

208
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,819
I messed up.

209
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,195
<i>I made a huge error.</i>

210
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,871
<i>I don't know what to say.
If you want me to resign, I will.</i>

211
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,471
I want you to tell me
what happened.

212
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,878
<i>They don't have minibars
at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.</i>

213
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,953
I guess I just saw all those little
bottles and I made an assumption,

214
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,325
<i>which I know we're
never supposed to do.</i>

215
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,728
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

216
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,704
<i>Those guys were drinking
out of a rented refrigerator.</i>

217
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,865
<i>A mini-fridge.</i>

218
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,035
- That's it?
- Yeah.

219
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,705
<i>- The rest of the piece is solid?
- Well, yeah, of course.</i>

220
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:52,149
<i>Go home, Steve.
Your resignation will not be required.</i>

221
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,018
<i>- Really? You're not mad?
- Of course not.</i>

222
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,218
Do you want my notes?

223
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,317
Have a good night.

224
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,959
Thanks, Michael.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,332
<i>Thanks for backing me.</i>

226
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,361
<i>It's what editors do.</i>

227
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,500
<i>Good night.</i>

228
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,459
<i>Hi, front desk, please?</i>

229
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,363
<i>Hi, I need some information.</i>

230
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,374
<i>Do the suites of your hotel
have minibars?</i>

231
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,908
<i>Well, can a guest
rent something like that...</i>

232
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,379
<i>like a mini-refrigerator
or something?</i>

233
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,407
<i>They can? Okay,
thank you very much.</i>

234
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,146
<i>And she says, "I didn't invite
Vernon Jordan that evening,</i>

235
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,681
<i>because my guests of honor
were girls from Smith College.</i>

236
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:11,025
<i>Some of them were virgins,
and I wanted to keep it that way."</i>

237
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,793
<i>And you are going to put that
in the article, right?</i>

238
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,232
Gosh, Alec,
I don't know.

239
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,930
<i>I mean, George
is such a dignified publication.</i>

240
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,303
You wouldn't want to put in something
that gossipy, would you?

241
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,331
No, absolutely not.

242
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,503
<i>Of course I'm putting it in.</i>

243
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,878
<i>Thank you Steve. You are going
to make me look very, very smart.</i>

244
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,578
<i>Er, the Fritos are running
dangerously low.</i>

245
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,610
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

246
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,113
<i>Can't hide in here
all-night, Ames.</i>

247
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,854
Can I ask you something?

248
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,559
What is this?

249
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,692
<i>I found it in the freezer.</i>

250
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,135
<i>You said you hated
how the Diet Coke at parties</i>

251
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,039
<i>was always at room temperature.
And if you wanted to drink it cold,</i>

252
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,511
<i>you'd have to put it on ice and it would
get too watery. Don't you remember?</i>

253
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,740
Yeah, I do, but...

254
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,975
<i>I said that
a couple of years ago.</i>

255
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,177
<i>Steve?</i>

256
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,379
<i>I'm going to call it a night,
but thanks for having me.</i>

257
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,183
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

258
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,056
<i>Alphabetized beer,
that's perfect.</i>

259
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,960
<i>- Drive safe, Alec.
- Who's he?</i>

260
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,225
<i>Associate Editor
of George.</i>

261
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,789
<i>When did you start
talking to George?</i>

262
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,234
<i>I'm really not.</i>

263
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,432
<i>It's probably nothing.</i>

264
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,431
<i>You know,
if they stoop any lower,</i>

265
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,001
<i>you won't be able to tell the difference
between Time and People.</i>

266
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,878
<i>You say that as if there is a difference
between Time and People.</i>

267
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,747
Exactly. Hey!
Thank you, Steve.

268
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,386
What?

269
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,223
<i>Are you mad at me?</i>

270
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,662
<i>I told you, I do not respond
to "Are you mad at me?"</i>

271
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,996
<i>I'm not your kindergarten
teacher.</i>

272
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,331
<i>I thought we'd been over this
a thousand times already.</i>

273
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,428
You can't go to law school.

274
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,530
<i>You "don't want to go
to law school," remember?</i>

275
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,873
<i>I know. It's only nights.
I wouldn't have to stop working.</i>

276
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,106
<i>I'm going to put these down.
I'll be right back.</i>

277
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,411
No, I want to talk about this.

278
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,508
<i>I told you, it's my parents.
Okay?</i>

279
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,645
<i>They never shut up about it.</i>

280
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,281
<i>If I don't go, they won't let me
be a journalist anymore.</i>

281
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,848
<i>"Let you"?
You're 24 years old, Stephen!</i>

282
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,157
<i>You don't know how things go
where I grew up, Caitlin.</i>

283
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,629
<i>There are rules there.</i>

284
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,360
<i>If your son's not a doctor or a lawyer,
you keep your curtains closed.</i>

285
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,527
<i>You're writing
for The New-fucking-Republic.</i>

286
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,594
Isn't that good enough?

287
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,902
<i>Not in Highland Park.</i>

288
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,408
<i>- I'm sorry, I...
- Stop apologizing for everything!</i>

289
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,140
<i>I was looking through your mail.
You should be pissed at me.</i>

290
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,173
I'm not.

291
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,208
<i>You're going
to throw this out, right?</i>

292
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,415
<i>I can't. I'm sorry.</i>

293
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,123
<i>Every station on the radio
was talking about it...</i>

294
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,926
<i>Mike Tyson
biting Evander Holyfield.</i>

295
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,195
<i>And these are supposed to be
news stations,</i>

296
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,203
<i>so on Tuesday I started
calling a few of them,</i>

297
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,432
<i>and I finally
got through to one.</i>

298
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,635
A Bible-talk station
in Kentucky.

299
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,941
<i>And I managed
to convince the screener</i>

300
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,277
<i>that I was a behavioral
psychologist</i>

301
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,648
who "specializes
in human-on-human biting."

302
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,447
<i>I told the guy that I'd done
all this extensive research</i>

303
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,481
<i>on people who chomp flesh
under extreme stress...</i>

304
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,926
And what did they say?

305
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,328
<i>They put me on the air,
I took calls for 45 minutes.</i>

306
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,265
Oh, my God!

307
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,961
<i>Where does he find
these people?</i>

308
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,097
It's kind of stupid,
I know. It's silly.

309
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,471
<i>I'll probably just kill it.</i>

310
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,043
Does that mean
you'll help me with it?

311
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,212
Why? Do you have finals
this week?

312
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,245
<i>Okay, moving right along.</i>

313
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,315
<i>Chuck, what do you have
for us?</i>

314
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,858
<i>That's a bit of a hard act
to follow.</i>

315
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,532
<i>Very hard act to follow.</i>

316
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,630
Okay.

317
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,233
<i>I'm starting the piece on Haiti,</i>

318
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,369
and I'll be going to...

319
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,711
<i>Hey.
Don't let me interrupt.</i>

320
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,543
<i>- Hey, Marty.
- Michael.</i>

321
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,816
<i>I'm going to be going
to Port- au-Prince for a few days.</i>

322
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,225
Uh-huh.

323
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,753
<i>Marty Peretz, our boss,
he's a little scary.</i>

324
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,349
<i>How about the commas and dates?
Are we supposed to circle those too?</i>

325
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,011
Let's just get this done, okay?

326
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,223
What the hell is this?

327
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,291
<i>Marty told us to circle
all the commas in the last issue,</i>

328
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,299
<i>so he could show us
how we used them improperly.</i>

329
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,823
What?

330
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,892
<i>He said, "Commas
should always appear in pairs."</i>

331
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,870
<i>Apparently the issue was rife
with comma errors.</i>

332
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,964
- "Rife"?
- That's what he said.

333
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,475
I see.

334
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,712
<i>No, I'm not angry, Marty.
I'm embarrassed for you.</i>

335
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,045
<i>These people work
grueling hours for meager pay.</i>

336
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,074
<i>They deserve a thank you,</i>

337
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,087
<i>not another one
of your world-famous tantrums.</i>

338
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:40,080
<i>Yeah, okay. I'd resign before
I'd let you bully them like that again.</i>

339
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,026
<i>And I will.
Do you understand that?</i>

340
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,327
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

341
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,270
<i>"The Great Comma Debate"
is history,</i>

342
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,904
<i>so we can all
go back to work.</i>

343
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,378
<i>There are good editors,
there are bad editors.</i>

344
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,444
You'll have both.

345
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,719
<i>My hope for you though
is that once,</i>

346
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,455
<i>at least once
you get a truly great one.</i>

347
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,921
<i>A great editor
defends his writers...</i>

348
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,958
<i>against anyone.
He stands up, and fights for you.</i>

349
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,563
<i>Michael Kelly
was that kind of editor.</i>

350
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,598
<i>He had that kind of courage.</i>

351
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,977
And that's what hung him.

352
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,285
Hello.

353
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,486
<i>Hey, Chuck, it's Marty Peretz.
You got a minute?</i>

354
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,792
<i>Of course,
how are you, Marty?</i>

355
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,128
<i>I'm in a bit
of an uncomfortable situation.</i>

356
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,293
<i>I thought you might
be able to help me out.</i>

357
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,427
<i>- Sure.
- It's about Mike.</i>

358
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,597
<i>- Oh.
- He and I...</i>

359
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,836
<i>well, it hasn't been working out
for some time now, as you know.</i>

360
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,811
<i>The tone of the magazine
I think it's... gotten too nasty!</i>

361
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,474
<i>It's strayed from the traditions
that make it great.</i>

362
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,143
<i>And... I'm going to be
making a change.</i>

363
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,380
I see.

364
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,117
<i>I'd like you to step in for him, Chuck.
I'd like you to become Editor.</i>

365
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,216
<i>Editor?</i>

366
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,717
<i>There's a catch, of course.
Mike doesn't know any of this yet,</i>

367
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,197
<i>and it's gonna be
two or three days before I tell him.</i>

368
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,633
<i>It'll have to remain between us
until then. Would that be a problem?</i>

369
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,137
<i>- Marty, Mike's a friend.
- I appreciate that, Chuck.</i>

370
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,402
<i>But I can't remove him until I know
who is going to be his replacement</i>

371
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,672
<i>for continuity's sake.
So this is how it has to be.</i>

372
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,872
I'm gonna have to think about this.

373
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,074
<i>I'm gonna have to discuss it
with Caterina.</i>

374
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,742
<i>Of course, of course!
Listen...</i>

375
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,446
<i>Marty, have you thought about the impact
this might have on the staff?</i>

376
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,819
<i>They feel very...</i>

377
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,256
<i>he's earned
a lot of loyalty there.</i>

378
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,282
<i>Yes, mostly by fighting with me.</i>

379
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,852
<i>The point is, I haven't earned
that kind of loyalty. If it looks like...</i>

380
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,127
<i>I'll be there tomorrow.
We'll go over all this in detail.</i>

381
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,135
<i>- Will you call me at the hotel?
- Yeah.</i>

382
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,798
<i>I really appreciate this, Chuck...
your discretion.</i>

383
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,774
<i>- Good night.
- 'Night, Marty.</i>

384
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,909
<i>So, I just got off the phone
with Marty,</i>

385
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,317
<i>and I've been fired,
effective immediately.</i>

386
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,121
<i>I'm to be out
of the building by 5:00 p.m.</i>

387
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,419
<i>Chuck Lane has been
chosen to replace me.</i>

388
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,972
<i>Chuck is not an editor.</i>

389
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,414
<i>He's barely even a writer.</i>

390
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,679
<i>There's no way I'm gonna
be able to work for him.</i>

391
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,811
<i>We should've seen this coming...</i>

392
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,290
<i>the way he laughs whenever
Marty tells a joke in the meetings.</i>

393
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,852
<i>They're never funny, but there's Chuck
completely howling. He's so political.</i>

394
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,659
<i>And stiff,
and humorless.</i>

395
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,166
And pissy. I mean,
how pissy does he get

396
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,464
<i>whenever you try to fact-check
one of his pieces?</i>

397
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,995
<i>It's like I'm sorry, but we have
an obligation to get our facts straight.</i>

398
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,304
<i>Okay, let's not overdo it.</i>

399
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,970
<i>This is still a great magazine,
it's still an important magazine.</i>

400
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,445
<i>And... Monday morning
he's going to be running it.</i>

401
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,176
<i>I'm going to barf.</i>

402
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,275
<i>All right.
Let me get out of here, okay?</i>

403
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,781
<i>Well, I just want
to thank you all again. Truly.</i>

404
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,657
<i>I've loved every second of this.</i>

405
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,658
Good luck, Mike.

406
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,829
You too, Chuck.

407
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:15,051
Hi.

408
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,384
- Hi.
- Hi.

409
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,655
So...

410
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,922
<i>sorry about
what happened when he left.</i>

411
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,759
I just didn't know what to do.

412
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,322
Thanks.

413
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,597
If you need a hand with the boxes,
I'll be in my office.

414
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,665
<i>So Chuck took over,</i>

415
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,676
<i>and the job,
for the first time ever,</i>

416
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,076
<i>began to feel like a job.</i>

417
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,308
<i>But I'm being unfair.</i>

418
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,408
<i>The truth is, I wrote 14 pieces while
Chuck was editing the magazine.</i>

419
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,578
<i>And the last of them,</i>

420
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,020
<i>was the biggest story
I ever wrote.</i>

421
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,286
<i>Is anyone interested
in hackers?</i>

422
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,893
Because I met this kid
named Ian Restil.

423
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,419
<i>Biggest computer geek
of all time.</i>

424
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:30,400
<i>He hacked his way into the database
of a company called Jukt Micronics,</i>

425
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,995
<i>and posted naked pictures
of women</i>

426
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:37,030
<i>and the salary of every Jukt employee
on Jukt's website with a note</i>

427
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,942
<i>saying, "The Big Bad Bionic Boy
has been here, baby!"</i>

428
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,171
Outstanding.

429
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,807
<i>The guys at Jukt decided
that it would be cheaper to hire him</i>

430
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,340
<i>as security consultant
than it would be to try to stop him,</i>

431
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,580
so they met with him
last week at the hotel

432
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,021
<i>where the National Hackers'
Conference was taking place.</i>

433
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,047
<i>It was the chairman
from Jukt,</i>

434
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,061
<i>Restil, Restil's mother
and Restil's agent.</i>

435
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,722
No...!

436
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,231
<i>Yes, hackers
have agents too.</i>

437
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,325
<i>All right, I was at the table
with these guys.</i>

438
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,666
<i>Restil's just laying out
all of his demands.</i>

439
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,672
<i>- I want a Miata...
- "I want a trip to Disney World."</i>

440
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,833
I want "X-Men"
comic book No. 1.

441
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,811
<i>"...a lifetime subscription to Playboy."
- And throw in Penthouse.</i>

442
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,871
<i>And they're complying
with every single word.</i>

443
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,110
<i>Excuse me sir,
pardon me for interrupting.</i>

444
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,381
<i>We can arrange more money
and you can buy the comic yourself.</i>

445
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,287
<i>And when you're
of a more appropriate age,</i>

446
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,484
<i>you can buy the car</i>

447
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,925
<i>and pornographic magazines
on your own.</i>

448
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,861
Cool.

449
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,735
<i>After that,
after they have the meeting,</i>

450
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,971
<i>he goes back into the conference,
where all these hackers have gathered,</i>

451
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,173
<i>and they're treating him
like he's a rock star.</i>

452
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,982
<i>Then, Restil jumps up on a table,
and he's like...</i>

453
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,085
I want a Miata!

454
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,997
<i>And he's gyrating his hips like this.
"I want a Miata!</i>

455
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,900
<i>I want my Playboys!
I want a trip to Disney World!"</i>

456
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,733
Show me the money!

457
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,672
"Show me the money!"

458
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,741
<i>Turns out there are now 21 states</i>

459
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,977
<i>considering versions of a law</i>

460
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,452
<i>called the "Uniform
Computer Security Act,"</i>

461
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,921
<i>which would criminalize
immunity deals</i>

462
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,151
<i>between hackers
and the companies they've torched.</i>

463
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,219
<i>Meanwhile, Restil's agent claims
a client list of over 300,</i>

464
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,458
<i>one of whom was once paid
a million dollars...</i>

465
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,489
<i>and a monster truck.</i>

466
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,627
That's unbelievable.

467
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,532
<i>It's really silly, I know.</i>

468
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,814
<i>I'm not even sure
if I'm going to finish it.</i>

469
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,930
Shit.

470
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,036
<i>You rang?</i>

471
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,239
<i>Yes, I rang.</i>

472
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,739
Why didn't you get this?

473
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,889
Yeah. Oh, that...

474
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,195
I don't know.

475
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,232
Hey.

476
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,364
Hey.

477
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,068
<i>Is it pronounced
"jooked" or "jucked"?</i>

478
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,565
<i>It's pronounced,
"give me back my article."</i>

479
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,250
Adam...! Can you give
a man a minute?

480
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,380
<i>Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.</i>

481
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,460
<i>Er, it's just that...</i>

482
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,226
<i>this New Republic piece
is a fucking sieve.</i>

483
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,691
<i>I started with a check
on "Jukt Micronics,"</i>

484
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,397
<i>which is supposed to be this major
software company in California.</i>

485
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,430
<i>I went through every search engine
on the Web... no matches found.</i>

486
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,068
<i>So I called 411
every area code in the state.</i>

487
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,204
<i>There's no listing anywhere
for a company called "Jukt Micronics."</i>

488
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,647
<i>Tried the California
Tax Franchise Board,</i>

489
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,809
<i>there's no record of taxes
ever having been paid</i>

490
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,580
<i>by a company
called Jukt Micronics.</i>

491
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,645
<i>Tried the State
Comptroller's Office,</i>

492
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,816
<i>no license has ever been applied for
by a company using that name.</i>

493
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,156
<i>Then I called
all the hackers I know,</i>

494
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,357
<i>asking if any had heard
of a "National Assembly of Hackers,"</i>

495
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,592
<i>or a hacker by the name
of "Big Bad Bionic Boy."</i>

496
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,999
<i>Nothing.
I even tried Ian Restil himself.</i>

497
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,129
<i>There's no listing for the kid in D.C.,
Virginia, Maryland.</i>

498
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,107
<i>There's no record of him ever having
attended a public school before.</i>

499
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,200
<i>- More?
- Please.</i>

500
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,939
<i>This guy Joe Hiert was described
in the Glass piece</i>

501
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,140
<i>as being this a former
basketball agent,</i>

502
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,616
<i>yet no one by that name has ever
been registered with the NBA</i>

503
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,710
<i>and none of my hackers
knew of him.</i>

504
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,778
<i>I even checked the names
of every government...</i>

505
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,882
I was just getting some coffee.

506
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,391
<i>I checked the names of every
government employee quoted in the piece,</i>

507
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,332
<i>against a book listing the names
of every government employee</i>

508
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:07,030
<i>in the entire United States.
None of the Glass sources were listed.</i>

509
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,037
<i>But there is one thing
in this story that checks out.</i>

510
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,440
What's that?

511
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,708
<i>There does appear to be a state
in the Union named Nevada.</i>

512
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,776
David.

513
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,184
<i>- For Christ's sakes.
- God, I'm sorry, Stephen.</i>

514
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:27,248
<i>I wanted to see if you read it yet.
It was sitting right here, you know?</i>

515
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,886
Don't hate me, okay?

516
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,556
<i>Stephen, you shredded it.</i>

517
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,159
<i>I'm trying to spare you
a spanking, David.</i>

518
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,068
<i>You've got blind quotes
all over the place.</i>

519
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,299
<i>Your facts are shaky.
I mean...</i>

520
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,865
<i>The line about the turnover
at DOT</i>

521
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,934
was low by 41/2%,
I checked.

522
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,173
<i>Of course you did.</i>

523
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,114
<i>Rob and Aaron would kill you
over that kind of stuff.</i>

524
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,710
<i>This is The New Republic,
remember?</i>

525
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,119
<i>Nothing slides here. If you don't have
it cold, you don't turn it in, ever.</i>

526
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,056
Okay.

527
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,719
<i>Look, bring me your notes later,
and we'll go through it together.</i>

528
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,126
<i>There's a lot about it
that I liked.</i>

529
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,189
- Really?
- Really.

530
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,395
<i>And get back to work, okay?
The mailroom floor needs scrubbing.</i>

531
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,960
Okay.
Thanks, Stephen.

532

534
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,188
<i>I just got done reading
your hacker article.</i>

535
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,419
<i>First of all,
congratulations.</i>

536
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,927
<i>I mean, everybody here
just loved it.</i>

537
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,931
<i>But we wanted to do
a companion piece to it,</i>

538
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,433
<i>sort of a "Day Two" story...</i>

539
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,935
<i>and I'm having some trouble
tracking down Ian Restil.</i>

540
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,462
<i>Do you think I could get
a phone number on him from you?</i>

541
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,903
<i>Look, I think it's good
that you tried this.</i>

542
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,675
<i>It's good to stretch.
I just...</i>

543
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,275
<i>I don't think you're writing
to your strengths here.</i>

544
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,684
- I mean...
- Can I?

545
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,791
<i>I'm wondering why you'd want to stray
from the things you do so well?</i>

546
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,032
Have you noticed the way

547
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,539
<i>Steve's phone
has been ringing lately?</i>

548

549

- Is that what you want, Amy?</i>

550
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,339
<i>To get a bunch of smoke blown
up your ass by a pack of editors?</i>

551
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,547
Yes.
Yes, it is.

552
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,648
<i>Caitlin, he's going

<i>freelancing like that.</i>

554
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,794
<i>These guys don't want

<i>But Amy,
you don't write funny.</i>

557
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,672
It's a little funny...

558
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,408

559
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,880

- Yeah.

561
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,596
<i>Do you have phone numbers

- Can I get them?</i>

563
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,400
<i>Of course. Did I do something wrong?
Are you mad at me?</i>

564
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,306
<i>No, I just need

Okay.

566
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:40,008

beside you to take some of the flak

589
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,694
in case this thing blows up.

590
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,823
<i>- Gosh, that's touching.
- You're completely swamped.</i>

591
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,164
<i>You're behind on the Kim Polese piece.
I know it's due Friday.</i>

592
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,260
I'll get to it.

593
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,704
<i>Everything that I'm working
on is so... dull,</i>

594
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,208
<i>and this is
spectacular.</i>

595
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,711
Andy... no.

596
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:19,205
<i>It's not like you found the story
yourself. Kambiz handed it to you.</i>

597
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,185
<i>If I hadn't been at the dentist,
it might be me about to get famous.</i>

598
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,687
<i>So why don't you just...
share the wealth, okay? Shit!</i>

599
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,491
<i>That came out a lot uglier
than I meant it. Sorry.</i>

600
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,361
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

601
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,499
<i>Well, Ian Restil
e- mailed me right back.</i>

602
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,739
<i>It might be tough to put you
in touch with him directly, though,</i>

603
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,077
<i>or at least until next week.
This is his e-mail:</i>

604
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,346
<i>"Your story screwed up my deal,
I don't to talk to y..."</i>

605
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,115
- I think he meant...
- "I don't want to talk to you."

606
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:00,988
<i>Yeah. "I'm on vacation with my parents,
so leave me alone."</i>

607
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:06,963
<i>What kind of parent goes on vacation
with their kid in early May?</i>

608
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,124
That's a good question.

609
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:13,068
<i>I guess you have to know his mom.
She's a little quirky.</i>

610
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:17,164
<i>That's his e-mail address,
if you want to write him yourself.</i>

611
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,105
<i>These are all my notes.</i>

612
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,637
<i>That's the number for the National
Assembly of Hackers.</i>

613
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,550
<i>Don't be thrown if all you hear
is a dark, deep, heavy breathing.</i>

614
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,078
<i>It's... I don't know,
their outgoing voicemail message.</i>

615
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,386
Don't ask me why.

616
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,019
<i>And then that's the number
for Jukt Micronics.</i>

617
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,723
<i>The chairman's name
is George Sims.</i>

618
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,028
<i>I can't figure why this Penenberg guy
would have such hard time finding it,</i>

619
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,433
<i>but you know, whatever.</i>

620
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,528
<i>That's the URL
to their website.</i>

621
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,404
<i>And then, I can't seem to find
Joe Hiert's number.</i>

622
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,035
<i>I was looking all over at home.
It's somewhere there. I know it is.</i>

623
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,204
<i>I'll get that to you tomorrow,
if that's okay.</i>

624
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,577
<i>- Sure.
- Yeah.</i>

625
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,777
He's Restil's agent.

626
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,808
<i>Should I...
I'll give you some privacy.</i>

627
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,150
No. Have a seat.
"650," is that Palo Alto?

628
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,214
<i>Er, no, Silicon Valley.</i>

629
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,694
<i>You'll probably get
a voicemail. I usually do.</i>

<i>That's actually his voice
on the answering machine.</i>

638
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,207
Sims is so hands-on,

639
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,243
<i>he won't even let his secretary
do an outgoing message.</i>

Who's next?

641
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,950
<i>Er, Penenberg.</i>

Oh.

00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,256
I'll take him.

Uh-huh.

684
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,246
<i>Look, if you were calling
for a comment on your story,</i>

685
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,687
<i>I don't have one,</i>

686

you'd never run the stupid thing.</i>

<i>That stuff was supposed
to be off the record,</i>

688
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,893
<i>and your reporter knows it,
that Glass guy.</i>

689
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,388
<i>- I'm calling to verify information.
- I'm not verifying anything.</i>

690
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,800
<i>Bottom line is, I'd like you guys
to basically get lost, okay?</i>

691
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,635
<i>Hello?</i>

692
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,267
<i>- Hey.
- David.</i>

693
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,212
<i>- I'm sorry, Steve.
- Shit.</i>

694
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,375
<i>I didn't mean to startle you.
I thought you'd like a cup of coffee.</i>

695
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,885
<i>- What are you doing here?
- Working late.</i>

696
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,513
<i>Working on my article,
so I don't get shredded again.</i>

697
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,648
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

698
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:04,627
<i>I always forget to ask you.
How are your studies coming?</i>

699
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,295
<i>Their fine.
I'm... just buried.</i>

700
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,459
<i>You're buried.
Right.</i>

701
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,662
<i>Okay. I should probably let you
get back to it.</i>

702
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:16,070
<i>- Is there anything you need?
- No. Good night, David.</i>

703
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,734
Good night.
Thanks, Steve.

704
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,811
<i>I got it.</i>

705
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,314
- Hello?
- Chuck? It's Steve.

706
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,382
Hi, Steve.

707
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,552
<i>Sorry to be calling
so late.</i>

708
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,824
<i>I was just wondering...</i>

709
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,696
<i>did you get a call from
the Jukt guy? George Sims?</i>

710
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:46,032
<i>- I did, yeah.
- Yeah. I was just sitting here,</i>

711
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,401
<i>and I realized that I'd given him
your home number</i>

712
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:52,340
<i>without asking you first.
And I wanted to apologize.</i>

713
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,937
<i>- It's fine.
- Sort of a prick, didn't you think?</i>

714
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,709
<i>I couldn't really tell
because he hung up so fast.</i>

715
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,082
<i>- Are you at home, Steve?
- No. Why?</i>

716
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,178
<i>I left a message
on your machine.</i>

717
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,985
<i>Those Forbes guys
want to talk to us again.</i>

718
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,185
<i>There's a conference call
at 9:00 a.m.</i>

719
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,217
<i>Sure.
Sounds like a party.</i>

720
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,388
Yeah?

721
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:18,099
<i>- Okay, night, Chuck.
- See you in the morning.</i>

722
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,133
<i>That's weird.</i>

723
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,509
<i>Morning.</i>

724
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,678
Hey.

725
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,651
<i>- Want a laugh?
- Sure.</i>

726
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,320
<i>- The website for Jukt Micronics.
- Oh, good.</i>

727
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,523
Yeah, you might not think so
when you see what's on it.

728
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:26,128
<i>I don't think Mr. Sims
liked our piece that much.</i>

729
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:37,209
<i>Yeah. And I found this too,
from my fridge for some reason.</i>

730
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,239
<i>Lan Restil's agent,
Joe Hiert.</i>

731

<i>I'd like to pause for a moment.</i>

732

<i>You can't go into the world of
journalism without first understanding</i>

735
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,338
<i>A three-day torture test.</i>

736
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,037
<i>If your article's good,
the process will only make it better.</i>

737
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,842
<i>If your article's shaky,
you're in for a long week.</i>

738
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,941
<i>A story comes in,
and it goes to a senior editor.</i>

739
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,578
<i>He, or she, edits it
on computer,</i>

740
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,884
<i>then calls in the writer,
who makes revisions.</i>

741
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,119
<i>Then the piece goes to a second editor,
and the writer revises it again.</i>

742
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,128
<i>Then it goes through a fact-check,
where every fact in the piece...</i>

743
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,562
<i>every date, every title,</i>

744
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,997
<i>every place or assertion
is checked and verified.</i>

745
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,730
<i>Then the piece goes to a copy editor,
where it is scrutinized once again.</i>

746
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,830
<i>Then it goes to lawyers,
who apply their own burdens of proof.</i>

747
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,307
<i>Marty looks at it too. He's very
concerned with any kind of comment</i>

748
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,470
<i>the magazine is making.</i>

749
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,480
<i>Then Production takes it, and lays
it out into column inches and type.</i>

750
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,709
<i>Then it goes back on paper,
then back to the writer,</i>

751
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,275
<i>back to the copy editor,
back to editor number one,</i>

752
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,584
<i>and editor number two, back to
the fact-checker, back to the writer,</i>

753
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,749
<i>and back to Production again.</i>

754
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,453
<i>Throughout, those lawyers
are reading and re-reading,</i>

755
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,520
<i>looking for red flags,
anything that feels uncorroborated.</i>

756
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,398
<i>Once they're satisfied, the pages
are reprinted and it all happens again.</i>

757
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:09,235
<i>Every editor, the fact-checkers...
they all go through it one last time.</i>

758
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:14,369
<i>Now, most of you will start out
as interns somewhere.</i>

759
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,507
<i>And interns do a lot of fact checking,
so pay close attention.</i>

760
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:21,881
<i>There's a hole
in the fact-checking system.</i>

761
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,443
A big one.

762
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:29,289
<i>The facts in most pieces can be checked
against some type of source material.</i>

763
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,295
<i>If an article's on,
say, ethanol subsidies,</i>

764
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,093
<i>you could check for discrepancies
against the Congressional Record,</i>

765
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,623
<i>trade publications,
LexisNexis,</i>

766
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,158
<i>and footage from C- SPAN.</i>

767
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,138
<i>But on other pieces,</i>

768
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,199
<i>the only source material
available</i>

769
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,269
<i>are the notes provided
by the reporter himself.</i>

770
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,414
Steve?

771
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:56,475
<i>This doesn't look like
a real business card to me.</i>

772
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,853
Yeah, I know.
That's the kind of clown this guy is.

773
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,324
<i>He won't even pay
to have real cards made.</i>

774
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,953
<i>All right.</i>

775
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,921
- My office at 9:00, okay?
- Yeah.

776
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,236
<i>Good morning.</i>

777
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,299
<i>A few other people
we can't seem to locate...</i>

778
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,277
<i>Julie Farthwork, Frank Juliet</i>

779
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,542
<i>and Ian Restil's agent,
Joe Hiert.</i>

780
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,948
<i>We called the numbers you gave us,
got voicemails for all three.</i>

781
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,943
<i>And the e-mails were sent back
"No address" or "Account closed."</i>

782
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:35,480
Really? 'Cause I've e-mailed them
about a million times each.

783
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,015
<i>Hiert's online all day long.</i>

784
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,085
<i>Did you call these people
and get them directly?</i>

785
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,393
No, I always left messages

786
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,422
and spoke to them
when they called me back.

787
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,994
<i>And the references in the article
to Nevada law enforcement officials.</i>

788
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,834
<i>Was Jim Ghort
the only one you spoke to?</i>

789
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,737
<i>- Yes.
- Do you have a number for him?</i>

790
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,834
<i>- Yeah, definitely.
- By the way, what was your basis</i>

791
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:58,109
<i>for writing that Jukt
was a big-time software company?</i>

792
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,208
<i>I didn't. That was added
by the copy desk, or during editorial.</i>

793
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,583
<i>Was the hackers' conference
where you met the Jukt executives...</i>

794
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,611
<i>That part of the article
is misleading.</i>

795
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,646
<i>I was never
in the Restils' home at all.</i>

796
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,683
<i>You weren't in Restil's home,
with the Jukt executives?</i>

797
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,251
No, I didn't mean
to imply that I had been.

798
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,000
<i>Sorry about that.
Did the fax come through okay?</i>

799
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,472
Yes, it did.

800
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,568
<i>I think the address must've gotten
garbled. We can't find the site.</i>

801
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,476
<i>- You want to read it back to me?
- Sure.</i>

802
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:34,348
<i>You gave us
"members. Aol. Juktn. Html."</i>

803
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,852
<i>- Wait. Was that an "M"?
- I'm sorry?</i>

804
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,219
<i>After Jukt, was that an "M,"
as in "Micronics"?</i>

805
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,953
<i>No, it was an "N",
as in "Not working."</i>

806
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,794
<i>- Try "M."
- Okay.</i>

807
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,129
<i>Sorry about that,
I was rushing.</i>

808
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,260
<i>Of course.</i>

809
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,532
<i>But I do find myself
wondering, Stephen.</i>

810
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,472
<i>Why would a major software
company put their website</i>

811
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,533
<i>where only AOL members can
access it, as opposed to the entire Web?</i>

812
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:03,137
I have no idea.

813
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,580
<i>I don't have a website so I don't really
know that much about them.</i>

814
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,913
<i>I would trust you guys
to know better than me.</i>

815
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,012
Okay. Looks like...

816
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,216
we have
the Jukt website up now.

817
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:27,698
I have to say, Stephen...

818
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,001
<i>this looks very
suspicious to me.</i>

819
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,099
How so?

820
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,940
<i>Quite frankly,
it doesn't look like a real website.</i>

821
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:38,778
<i>It looks like a site that was...
created to fool someone.</i>

822
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:41,909
<i>I don't know much about computers.
Could somebody do that?</i>

823
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,647
<i>- Of course.
- Very easily.</i>

824
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,416
<i>So easily, in fact,
it's incredible.</i>

825
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:49,789
<i>Do you still want that number
for Jim Ghort? I found it in my notes.</i>

826
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,621
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

827
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,062
<i>All right. 605, 84...</i>

828
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,123
<i>- Wait.
- Sorry?</i>

829
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,034
<i>"Six-zero- five,"
that's not Nevada.</i>

830
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,030
Oh.

831
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,216
<i>I guess I got him mixed up
with another source.</i>

832
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,379
<i>Er...</i>

833
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,995
<i>Sorry about that one.
Oh, you know what it was?</i>

834
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:32,229
<i>Jim Ghort was the guy who told me
about the law enforcement officials.</i>

835
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:37,570
<i>I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm going to have to get you...</i>

836
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,007
<i>Steve.</i>

837
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,443
<i>Give him the number.</i>

838
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,909
This guy is toast.

839
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,151
<i>All right, Stephen,
in light of all this,</i>

840
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:57,182
<i>how confident are you
in this story of yours?</i>

841
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,555
<i>Are we off the record?</i>

842
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,328
If you like.

843
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,894
<i>Well, off the record...</i>

844
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:12,237
<i>some of the things
that you've brought up...</i>

845
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,675
the website...

846
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,509
<i>the idea that I was always speaking
to these people through voicemail...</i>

847
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,642
<i>that is, that they were
always calling me...</i>

848
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,451
<i>it didn't seem strange before,
but clearly,</i>

849
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,821
<i>there are some problems with the story.
You've pointed them out.</i>

850
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:32,123
<i>One portion of it
was structured in a way that...</i>

851
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,959
I just... well...

852
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,595
in light of all this...

853
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,734
I just...

854
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,574
<i>I'm increasingly beginning to believe
that I've been duped.</i>

855
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,279
<i>And so we hang up,</i>

856
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,518
<i>after he's basically let these guys
interrogate me for an hour.</i>

857
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,789
<i>And I go, "Chuck,
wh-what happened?</i>

858
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,921
I mean, why
didn't you back me up?"

859
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,932
<i>He goes, "I'm sorry, Steve,
I've got to protect the magazine.</i>

860
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,991
<i>- I mean, I'm the editor."
- Typical.</i>

861
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:16,028
<i>He's being such an asshole.
So I'm dead, pretty much.</i>

862
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,235
Yes, this is Kambiz.

863
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,643
<i>Can we have a talk here?
Just editor to editor?</i>

864
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,275
<i>Sure. Go ahead.</i>

865
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:31,344
<i>Completely off the record, and really
almost human being to human being?</i>

866
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,083
<i>Of course.</i>

867
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,251
<i>You guys have discovered something
that a troubled kid has done,</i>

868
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,989
but I still don't know
how you plan to play it.

869
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,463
<i>We're not in the business
of "gotcha" journalism here.</i>

870
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,195
<i>I have no interest in embarrassing
you or The New Republic.</i>

871
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,931
<i>I'm not worried about me
or the magazine. That's fair game,</i>

872
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,599
<i>But there's a kid here
who basically,</i>

873
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,473
<i>just plainly, screwed up.
Big time.</i>

874
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,637
<i>His reporting was sloppy,
we know that.</i>

875
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,272
<i>But we're trying to handle it
internally at this point,</i>

876
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,839
just as you would.

877
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,148
<i>Listen, we're going to run
something</i>

878
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,984
<i>along the lines of,
"A trick was pulled,</i>

879
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,616
<i>and some very clever hackers
managed to create an illusion."</i>

880
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,751
<i>I can't tell you
what to print or not to print.</i>

881
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,989
<i>You guys are journalists.</i>

882
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:16,465
<i>But... he could be very hurt
by what you guys publish. His career.</i>

883
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,491
<i>Chuck, I understand.
I do.</i>

884
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,834
I would hope if I made
the mistakes he made,

885
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,499
<i>people would be
generous with me.</i>

886
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,771
<i>But...</i>

887
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,438
<i>this concerns the very field
we cover.</i>

888
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,674
<i>We have to run it.</i>

889
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:35,377
<i>And when we do, we're going to need
a comment from you.</i>

890
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,787
<i>So given everything
that's happened,</i>

891
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,383
<i>how strongly are you going
to stand behind the story?</i>

892
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,559
I'm looking into it.

893
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,831
<i>It's really not that big a deal.
You got fooled by a source.</i>

894
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,533
<i>It happens. They'll print
a retraction, and that'll be that.</i>

895
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:00,065
<i>Steve, it's not like
it's going to hurt your career.</i>

896
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,543
<i>Of course, if you weren't
so distracted by your classes,</i>

897
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:05,878
<i>- maybe this never would've happened.
- I know, I gotta quit. You're right.</i>

898
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:13,412
<i>Can I speak to you
for a minute, Steve?</i>

899
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,583
What about?

900
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,650
<i>Let's do it in private.</i>

901
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,766
<i>We need to take a drive
to Bethesda.</i>

902
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,202
<i>- What for?
- I want to meet Joe Hiert.</i>

903
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,302
<i>I already told you,
nobody knows where he is.</i>

904
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:39,179
<i>Maybe if we go to the hotel
where he met with Restil and Sims,</i>

905
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,581
<i>someone will remember him,
or have some clue...</i>

906
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,779
<i>There were hundreds
of people there, okay?</i>

907
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,118
<i>These Forbes guys
want to come down on you.</i>

908
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:49,454
<i>They are highly suspicious about some
of the material in that article.</i>

909
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,858
- You know that.
- Yeah.

910
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,363
<i>But they're going to go online
with their piece tomorrow.</i>

911
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,763
- Oh.
- Okay?

912
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,563
- Yeah.
- Now...

913
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:03,299
- Steve? Steve.
- Yeah?

914
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,569
<i>If we can find Hiert,</i>

915
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,304
<i>I can back them off
for a day or two, okay?</i>

916
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,744
- Okay. I'll get my notes.
- Okay.

917
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,356
<i>- Let's go.
- All right.</i>

918
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,595
<i>We were at this table.</i>

919
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,800
<i>Restil sat here,
his mother was on his left,</i>

920
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,331
<i>Hiert... sorry,
his mother was on his right.</i>

921
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,503
<i>Hiert sat there,</i>

922
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,672
<i>but Restil wanted him closer,
so he slid his chair over.</i>

923
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,978
<i>Sims sat here.
He had a lawyer next to him.</i>

924
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,177
<i>I forget the guy's name,
it's in my notes.</i>

925
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,345
<i>Somebody was smoking
at this table,</i>

926
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,981
<i>so Restil's mother insisted
that we move to one farther away.</i>

927
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,150
<i>Over there.</i>

928
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:59,161
<i>The Hacker Conference
was near here, right?</i>

929
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,823
<i>Yeah, the building next door.</i>

930
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,801
<i>I don't remember from the article.
How many people were at this thing?</i>

931
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:10,465
<i>It looked like a hundred,
might have been two. It's in my notes.</i>

932
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,840
<i>200 people? Here?</i>

933
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,450
<i>Yeah, they moved in and out.
I mean, most of them were kids.</i>

934
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,232
<i>That doesn't seem
credible to me.</i>

935
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,434
<i>All I know is I was here.</i>

936
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,172
<i>All of us were right here.</i>

937
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:52,204
<i>- Excuse me sir, can I help you?
- Yes, you can.</i>

938
01:00:56,786 --> 01:01:00,153
<i>We're looking into a conference
held here a couple of Sundays ago.</i>

939
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,124
<i>Computer hackers.
Do you remember anything like that?</i>

940
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,627
<i>Are you sure you're
in the right building, sir?</i>

941
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,425
<i>- Yes, we're sure.
- Why is that?</i>

942
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,590
Building's closed on Sunday.

943
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,430
<i>All I know is, I was here.</i>

944
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,736
<i>The conference was right here.</i>

945
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,211
That's why the Restils
only stayed a few minutes, okay?

946
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,909
Because it was such
a dumb place to squeeze into.

947
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:31,409
<i>So they went to a restaurant for dinner,
with some of Ian's hacker friends.</i>

948
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,615
Thank you.

949
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,786
- How many?
- Huh?

950
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,658
<i>People at the dinner.
How many?</i>

951
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,796
About 10, I think,
including me.

952
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,930
<i>Lan even put on a jacket.</i>

953
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,133
<i>- Hiert was there too?
- Yeah.</i>

954
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,905
<i>- Is it near here?
- Yeah, it's across the street.</i>

955
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,970
<i>Good,
let's cross the street.</i>

956
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,345
<i>You know, I really don't like
the way you're treating me, Chuck.</i>

957
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,374
It's like you won't even
talk to me.

958
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,613
- This is the place?
- Yes.

959
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:08,556
<i>I didn't do anything wrong, okay?
I didn't do anything wrong.</i>

960
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,924
<i>You saw my notes,
everything was in there.</i>

961
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,764
<i>I got tricked. I got fooled, I'm sorry.
What are you being so mad for?</i>

962
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,428
- It was 10 people?
- Yes.

963
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,938
<i>- For dinner?
- Yes.</i>

964
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,202
<i>They're closed at 3:00
on Sundays.</i>

965
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:29,678
Yeah, I know. I know, they almost
didn't let us in. Okay?

966
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,010
<i>But it was a couple
of minutes before 3:00,</i>

967
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:35,074
<i>and Ian looked like he was about
ready to cry, and so they said okay.</i>

968
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,814
<i>- But for dinner?
- Go in and ask them yourself, Chuck.</i>

969
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,915
<i>See if they would serve
a party that came in at 2:58</i>

970
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,188
<i>and the answer would be yes,
because that's when we got here.</i>

971
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,422
<i>The Forbes guys
are gonna have all this too,</i>

972
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,692
<i>and dig through the records
at that office building.</i>

973
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,529
<i>They have surveillance cameras
and they're gonna check them.</i>

974
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,592
<i>I didn't do anything
wrong, Chuck!</i>

975
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,366
<i>I really wish
you'd stop saying that!</i>

976
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,908
Steve...

977
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,806
come on, anyone
can make a mistake.

978
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,284
<i>You know,
this is not right, Chuck!</i>

979
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,049
<i>Okay, I feel really attacked.</i>

980
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,250
<i>And you're my editor.
You're supposed to support me,</i>

981
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:19,125
<i>and you're taking
their word against mine?</i>

982
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,722
<i>You're supposed
to support me!</i>

983
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,072
<i>Criticism of the 
President's program has been...</i>

984
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,234
<i>Leave it off.</i>

985
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,118
<i>I'm sorry I yelled at you
back there.</i>

986
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,815
Chuck?

987
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,463
Steve!

988
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:06,165
<i>- Pull the goddamn car over.
- Yeah.</i>

989
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,842
<i>All right.</i>

990
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:22,416
<i>There's been
so much pressure.</i>

991
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,694
<i>Chuck, I didn't mean
to get anybody in trouble.</i>

992
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,857
Okay. Okay.

993
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,229
<i>You weren't
at the conference?</i>

994
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,170
No.

995
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,667
<i>You know, I had a description of it
from so many sources,</i>

996
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:46,011
I thought I had it solid.
Okay?

997
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,539
And I wanted the piece
to have an eyewitness feel to it,

998
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:52,384
<i>for color... so...
I said I'd been there myself.</i>

999
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,754
<i>And everything
we just told the Forbes guys...?</i>

1000
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,158
<i>I'm so sorry, Chuck.</i>

1001
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,595
I just panicked.

1002
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,628
If you want me to say
that I made it up...

1003
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,662
I will.
If that'll help you, I'll say it.

1004
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:16,536
<i>I just want you
to tell me the truth, Steve.</i>

1005
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,706
Can you do that?

1006
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:23,141
<i>There might be facets
of this that you're not considering.</i>

1007
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,177
<i>- Why are you defending him?
- Nobody's defending him, Chuck.</i>

1008
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,851
<i>- Of course you're defending him.
- He's a kid.</i>

1009
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:33,055
<i>He doctored his notes, Lew.
Just consider that for a second.</i>

1010
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,359
You know?
He sat down,

1011
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,525
<i>and he hand-wrote
a bunch of phony quotes</i>

1012
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,830
<i>and handed them in
as source material for the fact-check.</i>

1013
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:43,430
<i>- Doesn't that offend you?
- Of course it does.</i>

1014
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,202
<i>He also lied to his editor.
That's supposed to offend you too.</i>

1015
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,507
<i>He's a confused, distraught kid
obviously, Chuck.</i>

1016
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,708
<i>So suspend him for a couple of months,
but let's not bury him.</i>

1017
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,909
Suspend him...

1018
01:05:55,918 --> 01:06:00,685
<i>There are also political considerations
to take into account here...</i>

1019
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,385
<i>the rest of the staff,
the way they feel about him.</i>

1020
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:06,486
<i>- I already know all that.
- What I'm saying is,</i>

1021
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:11,057
<i>if you fire him,
some of these people will leave.</i>

1022
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,536
I don't know if we'd still have
a magazine at the end of the day.

1023
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,604
- Hey, Caitlin.
- Not now, David.

1024
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:27,313

- Well, he's a wreck, of course.</i>

1025
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,616
<i>- I want him in here, Caitlin.
- He's too scared to come in here.</i>

1026
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,488
<i>He thinks you want to destroy him.
He knows what he did was horrible.</i>

1027
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,856
He knows how badly
he messed up.

1028
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:41,351
<i>The part he's most upset about
is Iying to you, Chuck.</i>

1029
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,422
<i>Because he knows you took it
as a sign of disrespect</i>

1030
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,661
instead of a panic move,
which is what it was.

1031
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,159
<i>Think about the workload he's been
carrying... all this and classes.</i>

1032
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,673
<i>He hasn't slept more than two hours
in nine months.</i>

1033
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,268
<i>So he got a little sloppy and he lied to
cover his tracks.</i>

1034
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,973
- He's sick about it.
- Caitlin...

1035
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,415
<i>the building he described,
it doesn't even exist.</i>

1036
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,112
He just made it up.

1037
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,487
So...?

1038
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,597
Obviously
he needs some help.

1039
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,233
<i>- He needs help.
- Just get him in here.</i>

1040
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,602
<i>You can't fire him.</i>

1041
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,971
<i>I don't think he'll survive.</i>

1042
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,602
<i>You don't understand,
we're all he has.</i>

1043
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,012
<i>You can't fire him,
Chuck.</i>

1044
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,648
Thanks, Lew.

1045
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,867
<i>Would you guys excuse us
for a minute?</i>

1046
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:50,289
<i>...watered-down stock,</i>

1047
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:53,853
and you know, within...
Steve!

1048
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,029
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1049
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,939
I'm so dead.

1050
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,409
<i>I mean, I'm over.</i>

1051
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:12,107
<i>Nobody's ever going
to hire me again, are they?</i>

1052
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:17,250
<i>I was so sloppy,
trusting my sources like that.</i>

1053
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,516
And then Iying about it.

1054
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:22,615
And to Chuck,
of all people...

1055
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:26,788
I mean, the one guy
who's hated me all along.

1056
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,592
<i>I'm sure that none of this
is personal.</i>

1057
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,861
No?

1058
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,300
Chuck keeps a list
in his head...

1059
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,929
<i>everybody who's
a "Michael Kelly" person.</i>

1060
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,134
A couple of times,

1061
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,473
I said some things
I shouldn't have said...

1062
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,774
about you.

1063
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:45,973
So now I'm on it.

1064
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,540
That's why he's so set
on killing me now.

1065
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:52,076
<i>Well, I have to tell you, Steve,
he's within his rights.</i>

1066
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,056
<i>The things you did
were fireable offenses.</i>

1067
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:58,526
<i>I know, I'm not saying
that they weren't.</i>

1068
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:03,396
<i>I did some terrible,
terrible things.</i>

1069
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,802
<i>But believe me, Michael,
Chuck doesn't care about any of it.</i>

1070
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:14,104
<i>It's my loyalty to you
that he's punishing me for.</i>

1071
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:17,601
<i>I'm such an idiot.</i>

1072
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,978
<i>Now who's going to hire me?</i>

1073
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:25,120
Steve, I have to ask you
something.

1074
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:30,117
<i>Did you ever "cook" a piece
when I was your boss?</i>

1075
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,061
<i>Did you ever lie to me?</i>

1076
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,792
<i>The "Young Conservatives" piece,
the mini-bottles?</i>

1077
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,395
<i>Was that true?</i>

1078
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:03,653
- Hello.
- Chuck, it's David Bach.

1079
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,058
<i>I'm really sorry to bother you at night,
but it seemed important.</i>

1080
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,053
<i>It's fine.
Is there a problem?</i>

1081
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,566
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

1082
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,693
I just got off the phone
with Stephen.

1083
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,931
<i>He sounds horrible.</i>

1084
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,996
Did you suspend him,
Chuck?

1085
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,066
<i>David,
what is the problem?</i>

1086
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,978
<i>He asked me if I would drive him
out to Dulles later tonight.</i>

1087
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,574
<i>He said he wasn't sure
he'd be safe driving by himself.</i>

1088
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,244
<i>I just thought I should
draw your attention to that.</i>

1089
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,345
<i>Did he say
where he was going?</i>

1090
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,152
<i>Yeah, he said he'd be staying
with his family for a while.</i>

1091
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,021
<i>That could only be
one of two places.</i>

1092
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,050
<i>His parents live
in Highland Park, right?</i>

1093
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:42,825
<i>Yeah. Or his brother,
out in Palo Alto.</i>

1094
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,993
<i>- I'm sorry?
- His brother, at Stanford.</i>

1095
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,663
<i>Chuck?</i>

1096
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,581
<i>You had your brother pose
as "George Sims."</i>

1097
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,319
What?

1098
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,793
<i>The phony recording
from Jukt Micronics?</i>

1099
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,262
<i>It's a Palo Alto number.</i>

1100
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:18,494
<i>Your brother is a student at Stanford.
You had him pose as Sims.</i>

1101
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,729
<i>- No, Sims is a real guy...
- Steve, Steve...</i>

1102
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,431
<i>I've talked to him a million times.
My brother and I aren't speaking...</i>

1103
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:26,600
Stop it. You faked Sims,
you faked a website...

1104
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,906
<i>- You faked all those voicemails...
- You don't know, Chuck.</i>

1105
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,504
<i>- Restil, Hiert, Ghort...
- You got this totally backward.</i>

1106
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:35,074
<i>It's all crap. I can trace it if you
make me. I'll find it all billed to you.</i>

1107
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,745
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.
Those are all real people.</i>

1108
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,482
<i>- They are?
- Yeah.</i>

1109
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,388
Look at me.

1110
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,724
And say that again.

1111
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:50,254
<i>Those are all real people.</i>

1112

Tsk... okay.

1113
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,701
<i>I want you out of here.</i>

1114
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,210
What?

1115
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,371
<i>I want you out of here,</i>

with you.</i>

1117

I have to put them on a disk.</i>

1118
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:13,119
<i>- No.
- No, there are mine. Personal stuff!</i>

1119
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,316
<i>I don't care.</i>

1120
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,750
I know you don't.

1121
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,193

- Don't touch it!</i>

1122
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,723
<i>- I'm in the middle of a file, Chuck!
- Back away from the desk!</i>

1123
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,861
<i>- God damn it!
- Leave it or I will call Security!</i>

01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,269
<i>- Jesus Christ.

1125
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,470
Can I take my Rolodex?

Steve...

1127
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,275
Can I take my law books?

1128
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,446
<i>Sure.</i>

01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:10,141
<i>You're fired, Steve.</i>

1173
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,745
What?

1174
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:17,091
<i>You're fired.
You've lost your job.</i>

1175
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,556
But you can't...

1176
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,016
Chuck...

1177
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,653
<i>will you please
take me to the airport?</i>

1178
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:57,154
<i>Jesus.</i>

1179
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,565
Please, okay?

1180
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:02,297
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.

1181
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:05,795
It's fine.

1182
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,469
<i>But I can't be by myself
right now.</i>

1183
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,471
Okay? I'm...

1184
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:16,177
<i>I'm afraid
of what I'm going to do.</i>

1185
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,745
<i>And you know,
I... I can't get there by myself.</i>

1186
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,351
<i>I'm not going anywhere
with you.</i>

1187
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,624
<i>Now, if you feel like
you're a danger to yourself,</i>

1188
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:30,688
<i>you can sit down for a few minutes
until you feel calm enough to go.</i>

1189
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,927
<i>But I am not going anywhere
with you.</i>

1190
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:36,404
<i>But... I'm afraid that I'm...</i>

1191
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,906
I'm going to do something,
okay?

1192
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,369
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

1193
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,776
Yeah.

1194
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,010
<i>It's a hell of a story.</i>

1195
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,084
Chuck, please?

1196
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:59,354
<i>Stop pitching, Steve.
It's over.</i>

1197
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:36,963
<i>"Spring Breakdown,"
"The Jungle."</i>

1198

1205
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:12,698
What the hell did you do
to Steve?!

1206
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,134
<i>He called me from his car, hysterical.
I asked him what was wrong,</i>

1207
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,230
<i>- he said, "Ask Chuck..."
- I fired him, okay?!</i>

1208
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,636
<i>Not suspended, fired.</i>

1209
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:30,173
Because this wasn't
an isolated incident, Caitlin.

1210
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,049
<i>He cooked a dozen
of them, maybe more.</i>

1211
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:35,284
<i>We're going to have to go
through them, you and I. All of them.</i>

1212
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:38,053
No, the only one was "Hack Heaven."
He told me that himself!

1213
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:41,221
<i>If he were a stranger to you, if he was
a guy you were doing a piece about,</i>

1214
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,754
<i>pretend that guy told you
he'd "only done it once."</i>

1215
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:46,028
<i>Would you take his word for it?</i>

1216
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,126
<i>Of course not,
you'd dig and you'd bury him!</i>

1217
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,262
And you'd be offended
if anybody told you not to.

1218
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:52,569
<i>Everyone of those pieces
was fact-checked. They...</i>

1219
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,371
So was "Hack Heaven"!

1220
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:00,140
<i>You're a good reporter.</i>

1221
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:04,345
<i>You've always been a smart, thorough
reporter. Why can't you be one now?</i>

1222
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:07,082
<i>Because what you're telling me
is impossible, Chuck.</i>

1223
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,317
<i>Go upstairs.</i>

1224
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:12,952
- Read them again.
- This is bullshit!

1225
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,985
<i>Make sure you go
all the way back,</i>

1226
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:18,625
<i>because half of them ran
when Mike was still here.</i>

1227
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,000
<i>That's what this is.
Of course.</i>

1228
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:25,666
<i>What are you going to do, Chuck,
pick us off, one by one?</i>

1229
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,403
<i>Everybody that was loyal to Mike,
so you have a staff that belongs to you?</i>

1230
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,638
<i>Is that the kind of magazine
you want to run?</i>

1231
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,012
<i>When this thing blows, there isn't
going to be a magazine anymore.</i>

1232
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:36,176
If you want to make this about Mike,
make it about Mike.

1233
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,344
<i>I don't give a shit.
You can resent me,</i>

1234
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,616
<i>you can hate me,
but come Monday morning,</i>

1235
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,919
<i>we're all going to have to answer
for what we let happen here.</i>

1236
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,859
<i>We're all going to have
an apology to make!</i>

1237
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:49,159
<i>Jesus Christ! Don't you have any idea
how much shit we're about to eat?</i>

1238
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,927
<i>Every competitor we ever took a shot at,
they're going to pounce.</i>

1239
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,801
<i>And they should.
Because we blew it, Caitlin.</i>

1240
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,135
<i>He handed us fiction after fiction</i>

1241
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,641
<i>and we printed them all as fact.</i>

1242
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:05,670
<i>Just because...
we found him "entertaining."</i>

1243
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,077
It's indefensible.

1244
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:13,952
Don't you know that?

1245
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:55,125
<i>- Is everyone in the conference room?
- Um-hm.</i>

1246
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,263
<i>You know what could've prevented
all this, don't you?</i>

1247
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:02,235
No. What?

1248
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,296
<i>Pictures.</i>

1249
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,502
<i>How could you
make up characters</i>

1250
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,444
<i>if everyone you wrote about
had to be photographed?</i>

1251
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,880
<i>You know, Stephen...</i>

1252
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:23,982
<i>if you wanted to, you could
do these kids a giant favor.</i>

1253
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:26,323
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1254
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,967
<i>You could write something boring
one of these days.</i>

1255
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:36,095
<i>Give them a little less
to live up to.</i>

1256
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,666
I suppose I could.

1257
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:43,438
<i>We don't want a bunch
of teenagers getting ulcers, do we?</i>

1258
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,349
<i>Good morning.</i>

1259
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,080
Hi.

1260
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,705
It's funny...

1261
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:21,907
...because I thought I was going
to have to explain all this to you.

1262
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,413
Well, what do you think
of this guy?

1263
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,664
Thank you.

1264
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,171
Thank you.

1265
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:54,477
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

1266
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:03,453
Thanks.
Thank you.

1267
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,214
<i>Steve?</i>

1268
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,379
<i>Stephen?</i>

1269
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,549
<i>We've read through
all the pieces now,</i>

1270
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:41,926

1276

<i>I'm going to read to you a list
of suspicious titles, one by one.</i>

<i>If you raise an objection
to a particular title,</i>

1278
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:08,317
<i>we'll fact-check it again in the hope
of removing it from the list.</i>

1279
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:12,816
<i>If you remain silent,
we'll assume that piece is fabricated...</i>

1280
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,763
<i>either partially or entirely,
and it will stay on.</i>

1281
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:20,632
<i>Is that clear to everyone?</i>

1282
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,498
Okay.

1283
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,665
<i>"Hazardous
To Your Mental Health."</i>

1284
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,982
That means it stays
on the list of suspicious pieces.

1285
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:38,178
<i>Fabricated pieces.</i>

1286
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:41,655
<i>We understand.
Can we move along?</i>

1287
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:46,350
<i>"Holy Trinity."</i>

1288
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,870

<i>You have to know
