1
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,705
young man's voice: there are
so many show-offs in journalism.

2
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,902
So many braggarts and jerks.

3
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,275
They are always selling,
always working the room,

4
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,645
always trying to make themselves
look hotter than they actually are.

5
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,242
The good news is,

6
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,685
reporters like that make it easy
to distinguish yourself..

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,916
If. you're
even a little bit humble,

8
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,481
a little self.-effacing or solicitous,
you stand out.

9
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,359
So you bring a co-worker lunch
if. he's buried under a deadline,

10
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,454
you remember birthdays.

11
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,829
It's true,
journalism is hard work,

12
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,324
everybody's under pressure, everybody's
grinding to get the issue out.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,000
Nobody's getting any sleep, but you are
allowed to smile every once in a while.

14
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,670
I mean, even Woodward and Bernstein
went out f.or a burger now and then,

15
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,908
and they won a Pulitzer.

16
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,439
Some reporters think
it's political content

17
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,179
that makes a story
memorable.

18
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,380
I think it's the people
you f.ind--

19
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,719
their quirks, their f.Iaws,

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,225
what makes them f.unny,
what makes them human.

21
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,660
Journalism is just the art
of. capturing behavior.

22
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,433
You have to know
who you're writing f.or.

23
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,462
And you have to know
what you're good at.

24
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,474
I record what people do,

25
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,499
I f.ind out what moves them,
what scares them,

26
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,341
and I write that down.

27
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,574
That way, they are the ones
telling the story.

28
00:01:55,615 --> 00:02:00,052
You know what? Those kind of. pieces
can win Pulitzers too.

29
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,972
Teacher: "Contributing writer
f.or Harper's Magazine,

30
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,710
contributing writer
f.or George magazine,

31
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,881
contributing writer
for Rolling Stone,

32
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,948
and of course,
associate editor

33
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:16,325
of the New Republic magazine
in Washington D.C.

34
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,359
Sorry if I'm beaming, but, you know,
I was his journalistic muse.

35
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,303
- It's true.
- ( students Iaugh )

36
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,364
Just seven years ago,
he was sitting--

37
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,535
right there.

38
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,513
I'm sorry.
Right there.

39
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,072
And I was doing the exact
same thing you guys are doing--

40
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:41,109
grinding out pieces
and then having horrid nightmares

41
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,385
of Mrs. Duke
and her infamous red pen.

42
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,153
( Iaughter )

43
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:51,527
And see what happens
when greatness is demanded of you?

44
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,897
Now he's at
The New Republic.

45
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,370
And now I'm at
The New Republic.

46
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,484
Man: In May, the editors
of. The New Republic magazine...

47
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,893
Woman:...with The Washington Post,
The New Republic, and The Boston Globe.

48
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,194
But the bill was blasted
in The New Republic this week.

49
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,666
Man #1 : You're very helpf.ul.
I just wanted to get a conf.irmation...

50
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,901
Man #2: So, I said,
"Network news, network news. Hmm.

51
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,999
Oh, right, that's that show
that's on every night

52
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,808
between those "Fixodent"
commercials, right?" That shut him up.

53
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,913
- Tall man: Hey, Steve.
- Man #2: Hey, Steve.

54
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,884
Hey, guys.

55
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,116
- GIoria, that necklace is you.
- Thanks, doll.

56
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,851
I got some new merchandise.
For your girlfriend.

57
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,416
- As soon as I get this piece done.
- How is it coming?

58
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,055
- Horrible.
- Uh-huh.

59
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,122
It's the fundamental nature
of the magazine, Lew.

60
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,328
- Mallory, can I get some copies?
- Sure.

61
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,803
People want photographs,
they can buy Newsweek.

62
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,738
They do buy Newsweek.
And Time,

63
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,607
and US News & World Report.
And our Iosses are a joke.

64
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,975
Let me guess. He's on you again
about a redesign.

65
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,243
- yeah, cover page and graphics.
- And photographs.

66
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,443
Let me remind you Steve,

67
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,716
this magazine hasn't changed
its Iook since the '80s.

68
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,815
How is it?

69
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,883
It's good.

70
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,258
- you hate it.
- No, it's good, It's a Iittle rough.

71
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,891
No, it's the worst thing
I ever wrote. It's horrible.

72
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,561
If you guys don't help me with it,
I'm not even going to send it in.

73
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,128
- When is it due?
- Tomorrow.

74
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,265
Tsk...

75
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,741
I may have to kill myself.

76
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,575
I mean, The New York Times
Magazine!

77
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,810
Will you guys
help me with it, please?

78
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,113
- Of course.
- Of course.

79
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,143
Thank you.

80
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,486
Call for you on three, sweetie--
someone from Policy Review.

81
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,651
When did you start talking
to Policy Review?

82
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,661
I'm not. It's probably nothing.
Send it to my voicemail, okay?

83
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,356
- Oh, and sweetie...?
- Mm-hmm?

84
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,992
Caitlin just told me that she needs
gifts for... two showers next week?

85
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,195
you think you might have
something for her?

86
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,534
I'II get my box.

87
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,999
- Stephen: I couldn't resist.
- So, do you want to do this now, or--

88
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,705
yeah, in a second.
I have to return a quick phone call.

89
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,704
I got you some gum.

90
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,183
Oh...!

91
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,487
If I were to throw a party,
where all we did was play "Monopoly,"

92
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,219
- would you guys come?
- Could I be the Iittle shoe?

93
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,352
Of course.

94
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,961
Editor #1 : The Iawyers have asked us
to tone down the cover on Serbia.

95
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,488
- Editor #2: They have?
- It might invite charges of Iibel.

96
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,627
I know a Iittle bit of Iibel Iaw,

97
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,037
it's only relevant if the person in
question has been out of the public eye.

98
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,701
Well, yes.
So there is Serbia, hidden,

99
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,040
unknown to the world
at Iarge, until...

100
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,410
it appeared on the cover
of The New Republic.

101
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,915
Our weekly circulation
of 80,000.

102
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,043
- 81.5.
- you almost done with it, Rob?

103
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,418
- Two days. Tops.
- yes, two days from Chanukah.

104
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,288
Hey, it's basically finished--
for the most part.

105
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,486
Next up. Amy?

106
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,793
Just finished the piece
on ethanol subsidies.

107
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,164
There are 16,800 magazines
in this country.

108
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,160
But only one calls itself "the in-flight
magazine of Air Force One."

109
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,572
And that's the thrill
of working at The New Republic.

110
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,442
You're underpaid,
the hours are brutal,

111
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,470
but what you write gets read
by people who matter.

112
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,418
Presidents, Iawmakers-- your work
can actually influence public policy.

113
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,013
That's--
that's an amazing privilege,

114
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,752
and a huge responsibility.

115
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,521
I'm sorry.
They don't want to hear

116
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,759
the whole "journalistic
responsibility" speech-- do you?

117
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,199
you just want to know how to get
your name in print, right?

118
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,396
( Iight Iaughter )

119
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,305
That sounds familiar.
Okay.

120
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,708
Let me take you through the Iife
of your typical piece

121
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,407
so you can see
what some of the hurdles are.

122
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,745
We'II use one I wrote Iast year,

123
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,411
about a bunch of young Republicans
at a Conservatives' convention.

124
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,114
Now, journalism is about
pursuing the truth.

125
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,289
And I would never encourage you
to do anything sneaky or dishonest

126
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,593
in pursuit of a story,
such as assuming a phony identity.

127
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,334
I don't know, man. It seemed Iike
a pretty good turnout to me.

128
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,706
No, man.
Conservatism is dead.

129
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,938
- Dead?
- We're lost.

130
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,038
Damn straight.

131
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,141
Stephen: On a story like that,
your notes are crucial.

132
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,709
You have to record
everything you see and hear.

133
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,313
Every quote, every detail...

134
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,824
all the way down
to the mini-bottles in the f.ridge.

135
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,656
We're Iike this guy
who has to pee,

136
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,789
Iost in the desert,
Iooking for a tree.

137
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,732
That's true.
Completely true.

138
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,899
you guys know what
you're shopping for, right?

139
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,306
yeah, totally.

140
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,336
Get us a real "heifer."
The fatter the better.

141
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,575
Bad acne would be a bonus.

142
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,050
Redheaded man:
Let's do it!

143
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,144
( screaming )

144
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,189
( jeering )

145
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,908
- Hey, Steve.
- Hey, Chuck.

146
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,150
What are you working on?

147
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:00,420
A piece Gabriel Garcia Marquez
wrote about the Falklands War.

148
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,518
How about you?

149
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,059
young Republicans
at a CPAC Conference.

150
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,001
Pretty standard stuff.

151
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:15,303
Hotel ballrooms, boring speeches.
Chicken dinners.

152
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,240
Which is why everybody spends
their time in the suites upstairs

153
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,375
committing felonies.

154
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,784
Oh, yeah?

155
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,119
yeah. I went to one.
The ballroom was empty.

156
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:35,423
Every delegate under the age of 25
was on the fifth floor getting Ioaded.

157
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,452
Drugs, binge drinking,
hookers--

158
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,862
it gets pretty ugly.

159
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,228
- Sounds great, Steve.
- So does yours.

160
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,100
Okay, well, I gotta get back to work.
Have a good Iunch.

161
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,508
Chuck:
Thanks.

162
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,572
Hold it. Have to give myself
a demerit for poor scene setting.

163
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,083
Let me explain. A year ago,
Chuck Lane and I were peers.

164
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,279
He hadn't become editor yet.

165
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,447
Michael Kelly was editing
the magazine then.

166
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,323
Sorry, Mrs. Duke.
I know how you feel about clarity.

167
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,458
We've got to start calling
some other places.

168
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,629
I don't think I can
eat this stuff every day.

169
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,198
It was the Cannon Building.
you had it as "Russell."

170
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,368
I fixed it.

171
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,401
- Thank you.
- I really Iiked it, Ames.

172
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,175
But boring, right?

173
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,707
No. No. I really,
really Iiked it.

174
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,347
- Ahem--
- yes, dear?

175
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,551
Somebody for you on three--
someone from Harper's.

176
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,617
When did you start
talking to Harper's?

177
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,096
I'm not. It's probably nothing.
Could you send it to my voicemail?

178
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,258
- Very good.
- By the way, GIo',

179
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,790
that Iipstick is the bomb.

180
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:54,135
- Thanks, doll.
- Was it "Midnight Mist"?

181
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,511
- I've really got to stop doing that.
- What?

182
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,605
AII I do is give people
more reasons to assume I'm gay.

183
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,116
I mean, Iately,
it's everyone.

184
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,314
The other night, I went out to dinner
with this guy from The Post--

185
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,118
- Who?
- I can't tell you, he made me promise.

186
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:15,753
Anyway, we're walking afterwards,
talking about Medicare for God's sakes,

187
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,255
the next thing I know is we're standing
on the corner of 18th and "T"...

188
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,963
and he somehow managed
to slip his tongue down my throat.

189
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:32,203
And I'm Iike, "Wait a minute,
how'd this happen?"

190
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,941
I don't understand.
- Neither did I.

191
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,848
- Hey!
- Michael.

192
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,476
- Do you have a minute?
- Of. course.

193
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,953
We have a problem
with the "Spring Breakdown" piece.

194
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,980
Just got a Ietter from David Keene.
He ran the CPAC Conference.

195
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,152
- He's made--
- Are you mad at me?

196
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:53,029
He's made some pretty serious
charges. We need to answer them.

197
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,795
Okay.
My notes are at home.

198
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,962
I can be back in 20 minutes.
Is that too Iong?

199
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,302
Do your notes have anything
about the minibars? That would help.

200
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,707
I think so.
No, I'm sure. Why?

201
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,371
He claims the Omni Shoreham
doesn't even have minibars.

202
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,779
- He mentioned it specifically.
- No, I saw them.

203
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,283
There were Iittle bottles
of booze all over the room.

204
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,017
Okay. I'II get Aaron
and Rob into it,

205
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,081
and start
the fact-check again.

206
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,922
- Stephen: I'II get my notes.
- Thank you.

207
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,259
I'm sorry, we're gonna
have to finish this Iater.

208
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,163
No, no. I understand.
Thank you.

209
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,738
What's wrong?

210
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,186
Just tell me.

211
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,745
Keene was right,
Michael.

212
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,819
I messed up.

213
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,195
I made a huge error.

214
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,871
I don't know what to say.
If you want me to resign, I will.

215
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,471
I want you to tell me
what happened.

216
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,878
They don't have minibars
at the Omni Shoreham Hotel.

217
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,953
I guess I just saw all those Iittle
bottles and I made an assumption,

218
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,325
which I know we're
never supposed to do.

219
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,728
I'm really sorry.

220
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,704
Those guys were drinking
out of a rented refrigerator.

221
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,865
A mini-fridge.

222
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,035
- That's it?
- yeah.

223
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,705
- The rest of the piece is solid?
- Well, yeah, of course.

224
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:52,149
Go home, Steve.
your resignation will not be required.

225
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,018
- Really? you're not mad?
- Of course not.

226
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,218
( sighs )
Do you want my notes?

227
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,317
Have a good night.

228
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,959
Thanks, Michael.

229
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,332
Thanks for backing me.

230
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,361
It's what editors do.

231
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,500
Good night.

232
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,459
Hi, front desk, please?

233
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,363
Hi, I need some information.

234
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,374
Do the suites of your hotel
have minibars?

235
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,908
Well, can a guest
rent something Iike that--

236
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,379
Iike a mini-refrigerator
or something?

237
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,407
They can? Okay,
thank you very much.

238
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,146
And she says, "I didn't invite
Vernon Jordan that evening,

239
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,681
because my guests of honor
were girls from Smith College.

240
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:11,025
Some of them were virgins,
and I wanted to keep it that way."

241
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,793
And you are going to put that
in the article, right?

242
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,232
Gosh, AIec,
I don't know.

243
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,930
I mean, George
is such a dignified publication.

244
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,303
you wouldn't want to put in something
that gossipy, would you?

245
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,331
No, absolutely not.

246
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,503
Of course I'm putting it in.

247
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,878
Thank you Steve. you are going
to make me Iook very, very smart.

248
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,578
Er, the Fritos are running
dangerously Iow.

249
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,610
I'II be right back.

250
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,113
Can't hide in here
all-night, Ames.

251
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,854
Can I ask you something?

252
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,559
What is this?

253
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,692
I found it in the freezer.

254
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,135
you said you hated
how the Diet Coke at parties

255
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,039
was always at room temperature.
and if you wanted to drink it cold,

256
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,511
you'd have to put it on ice and it would
get too watery. Don't you remember?

257
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,740
yeah, I do, but--

258
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,975
I said that
a couple of years ago.

259
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,177
AIec:
Steve?

260
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,379
I'm going to call it a night,
but thanks for having me.

261
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,183
Thanks for coming.

262
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,056
AIphabetized beer,
that's perfect.

263
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,960
- Stephen: Drive saf.e, Alec.
- Who's he?

264
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,225
Associate Editor
of George.

265
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,789
When did you start
talking to George?

266
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,234
I'm really not.

267
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,432
It's probably nothing.

268
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,431
you know,
if they stoop any Iower,

269
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,001
you won't be able to tell the difference
between Time and People.

270
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,878
you say that as if there is a difference
between Time and People.

271
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,747
Exactly. Hey!
Thank you, Steve.

272
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,386
What?

273
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,223
Are you mad at me?

274
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,662
I told you, I do not respond
to "Are you mad at me?"

275
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,996
I'm not your kindergarten
teacher.

276
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,331
I thought we'd been over this
a thousand times already.

277
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,428
you can't go to Iaw school.

278
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,530
you "don't want to go
to Iaw school," remember?

279
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,873
I know. It's only nights.
I wouldn't have to stop working.

280
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,106
I'm going to put these down.
I'II be right back.

281
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,411
No, I want to talk about this.

282
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,508
I told you, it's my parents.
Okay?

283
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,645
They never shut up about it.

284
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,281
If I don't go, they won't Iet me
be a journalist anymore.

285
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,848
"Let you"?
you're 24 years old, Stephen!

286
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,157
you don't know how things go
where I grew up, Caitlin.

287
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,629
There are rules there.

288
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,360
If your son's not a doctor or a Iawyer,
you keep your curtains closed.

289
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,527
you're writing
for The New-f.ucking-Republic.

290
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,594
Isn't that good enough?

291
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,902
Not in Highland Park.

292
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,408
- I'm sorry, I--
- Stop apologizing for everything!

293
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,140
I was Iooking through your mail.
you should be pissed at me.

294
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,173
I'm not.

295
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,208
you're going
to throw this out, right?

296
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,415
I can't. I'm sorry.

297
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,123
Every station on the radio
was talking about it--

298
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,926
Mike Tyson
biting Evander Holyfield.

299
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,195
And these are supposed to be
news stations,

300
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,203
so on Tuesday I started
calling a few of them,

301
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,432
and I finally
got through to one.

302
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,635
A Bible-talk station
in Kentucky.

303
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,941
And I managed
to convince the screener

304
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,277
that I was a behavioral
psychologist

305
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,648
who "specializes
in human-on-human biting."

306
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,812
( Iaughter )

307
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,447
I told the guy that I'd done
all this extensive research

308
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,481
on people who chomp flesh
under extreme stress--

309
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,926
And what did they say?

310
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,328
They put me on the air,
I took calls for 45 minutes.

311
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,265
Oh, my God!

312
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,961
Where does he find
these people?

313
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,097
It's kind of stupid,
I know. It's silly.

314
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,471
I'II probably just kill it.

315
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,534
( mocking,
gentle jeers )

316
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,043
Does that mean
you'II help me with it?

317
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,212
Why? Do you have finals
this week?

318
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,245
Okay, moving right along.

319
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,315
Chuck, what do you have
for us?

320
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,623
( sighs )

321
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,858
That's a bit of a hard act
to follow.

322
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,532
( nervous chuckle )
Very hard act to follow.

323
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,630
Okay.

324
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,233
I'm starting the piece on Haiti,

325
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,369
and I'II be going to--

326
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,711
Hey.
Don't Iet me interrupt.

327
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,543
- Hey, Marty.
- Michael.

328
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,816
I'm going to be going
to Port-au-Prince for a few days.

329
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,225
Uh-huh.

330
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,753
Marty Peretz, our boss,
he's a Iittle scary.

331
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,393
( bangs )

332
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,349
How about the commas and dates?
Are we supposed to circle those too?

333
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,011
Let's just get this done, okay?

334
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,223
What the hell is this?

335
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,291
Marty told us to circle
all the commas in the Iast issue,

336
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,299
so he could show us
how we used them improperly.

337
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,823
What?

338
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,892
He said, "Commas
should always appear in pairs."

339
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,870
Apparently the issue was rife
with comma errors.

340
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,964
- "Rife"?
- That's what he said.

341
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,475
I see.

342
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,712
No, I'm not angry, Marty.
I'm embarrassed f.or you.

343
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,045
These people work
grueling hours f.or meager pay.

344
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,074
They deserve a thank you,

345
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,087
not another one
of. your world-f.amous tantrums.

346
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:40,080
Yeah, okay. I'd resign bef.ore
I'd let you bully them like that again.

347
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,026
And I will.
Do you understand that?

348
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,327
Okay. Thank you.
( handset slams )

349
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,270
"The Great Comma Debate"
is history,

350
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,904
so we can all
go back to work.

351
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,378
There are good editors,
there are bad editors.

352
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,444
you'II have both.

353
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,719
My hope for you though
is that once,

354
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,455
at Ieast once
you get a truly great one.

355
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,921
A great editor
defends his writers--

356
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,958
against anyone.
He stands up, and fights for you.

357
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,563
Michael Kelly
was that kind of editor.

358
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,598
He had that kind of courage.

359
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,977
And that's what hung him.

360
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,140
( phone ringing )

361
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,285
Hello.

362
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,486
Hey, Chuck, it's Marty Peretz.
You got a minute?

363
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,792
Of course,
how are you, Marty?

364
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,128
I'm in a bit
of. an uncomf.ortable situation.

365
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,293
I thought you might
be able to help me out.

366
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,427
- Sure.
- It's about Mike.

367
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,597
- Oh.
- He and l--

368
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,836
well, it hasn't been working out
f.or some time now, as you know.

369
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,811
The tone of. the magazine
I think it's-- gotten too nasty!

370
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,474
It's strayed f.rom the traditions
that make it great.

371
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,143
And-- I'm going to be
making a change.

372
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,380
I see.

373
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,117
I'd like you to step in f.or him, Chuck.
I'd like you to become Editor.

374
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,216
Editor?

375
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,717
There's a catch, of. course.
Mike doesn't know any of. this yet,

376
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,197
and it's gonna be
two or three days bef.ore I tell him.

377
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,633
It'll have to remain between us
until then. Would that be a problem?

378
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,137
- Marty, Mike's a friend.
- I appreciate that, Chuck.

379
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,402
But I can't remove him until I know
who is going to be his replacement

380
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,672
f.or continuity's sake.
So this is how it has to be.

381
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,872
I'm gonna have to think about this.

382
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,074
I'm gonna have to discuss it
with Caterina.

383
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,742
Of. course, of. course!
Listen--

384
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,446
Marty, have you thought about the impact
this might have on the staff?

385
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,819
They feel very--

386
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,256
he's earned
a Iot of Ioyalty there.

387
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,282
( chuckles )
Yes, mostly by f.ighting with me.

388
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,852
The point is, I haven't earned
that kind of Ioyalty. If it Iooks Iike--

389
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,127
I'll be there tomorrow.
We'll go over all this in detail.

390
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,135
- Will you call me at the hotel?
- yeah.

391
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,798
I really appreciate this, Chuck--
your discretion.

392
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,774
- Good night.
- 'Night, Marty.

393
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,909
So, I just got off the phone
with Marty,

394
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,317
and I've been fired,
effective immediately.

395
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,121
I'm to be out
of. the building by 5:00 p.m.

396
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,419
Chuck Lane has been
chosen to replace me.

397
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,972
Chuck is not an editor.

398
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,414
He's barely even a writer.

399
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,679
There's no way I'm gonna
be able to work for him.

400
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,811
Stephen:
We should've seen this coming--

401
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,290
the way he Iaughs whenever
Marty tells a joke in the meetings.

402
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,852
They're never funny, but there's Chuck
completely howling. He's so political.

403
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,659
And stiff,
and humorless.

404
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,166
And pissy. I mean,
how pissy does he get

405
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,464
whenever you try to fact-check
one of his pieces?

406
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,995
It's Iike I'm sorry, but we have
an obligation to get our facts straight.

407
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,304
Okay, Iet's not overdo it.

408
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,970
This is still a great magazine,
it's still an important magazine.

409
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,445
And... Monday morning
he's going to be running it.

410
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,176
- I'm going to barf.
- ( Iaughs )

411
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,275
AII right.
Let me get out of here, okay?

412
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,781
Well, I just want
to thank you all again. Truly.

413
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,657
I've Ioved every second of this.

414
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,658
Good Iuck, Mike.

415
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,829
you too, Chuck.

416
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,880
( softly )
Hi.

417
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,051
Hi.

418
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,357
( sighs )

419
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,384
- Hi.
- Hi.

420
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,655
So...

421
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,922
sorry about
what happened when he Ieft.

422
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,759
I just didn't know what to do.

423
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,322
Thanks.

424
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,597
If you need a hand with the boxes,
I'II be in my office.

425
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,665
Stephen:
So Chuck took over,

426
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,676
and the job,
f.or the f.irst time ever,

427
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,076
began to f.eel like a job.

428
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,308
But I'm being unf.air.

429
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,408
The truth is, I wrote 14 pieces while
Chuck was editing the magazine.

430
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,578
And the last of. them,

431
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,020
was the biggest story
I ever wrote.

432
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,286
Is anyone interested
in hackers?

433
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,893
Because I met this kid
named Ian Restil.

434
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,419
Biggest computer geek
of. all time.

435
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:30,400
He hacked his way into the database
of a company called Jukt Micronics,

436
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,995
and posted naked pictures
of women

437
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:37,030
and the salary of every Jukt employee
on Jukt's website with a note

438
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,942
saying, "The Big Bad Bionic Boy
has been here, baby!"

439
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,036
( Iaughter )

440
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,171
Outstanding.

441
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,807
The guys at Jukt decided
that it would be cheaper to hire him

442
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,340
as security consultant
than it would be to try to stop him,

443
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,580
so they met with him
Iast week at the hotel

444
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,021
where the National Hackers'
Conference was taking place.

445
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,047
It was the chairman
f.rom Jukt,

446
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,061
Restil, Restil's mother
and Restil's agent.

447
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,722
No--!

448
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,231
yes, hackers
have agents too.

449
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,325
All right, I was at the table
with these guys.

450
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,666
Restil's just laying out
all of. his demands.

451
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,672
- I want a Miata--
- "I want a trip to Disney World."

452
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,833
I want "X-Men"
comic book No. 1.

453
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,811
"...a Iifetime subscription to Playboy. "
- And throw in Penthouse.

454
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,871
And they're complying
with every single word.

455
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,110
Excuse me sir,
pardon me for interrupting.

456
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,381
We can arrange more money
and you can buy the comic yourself..

457
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,287
And when you're
of. a more appropriate age,

458
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,484
you can buy the car

459
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,925
and pornographic magazines
on your own.

460
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,861
Cool.

461
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,735
Stephen: After that,
after they have the meeting,

462
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,971
he goes back into the conf.erence,
where all these hackers have gathered,

463
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,173
and they're treating him
like he's a rock star.

464
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,341
( cheering, applause )

465
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,982
Then, Restil jumps up on a table,
and he's like--

466
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,085
I want a Miata!

467
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,997
And he's gyrating his hips Iike this.
"I want a Miata!

468
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,900
I want my PIayboys!
I want a trip to Disney World!"

469
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,733
( both )
Show me the money!

470
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,672
"Show me the money!"

471
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,005
( cheering )

472
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,741
Turns out there are now 21 states

473
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,977
considering versions of a Iaw

474
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,452
called the "Uniform
Computer Security Act,"

475
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,921
which would criminalize
immunity deals

476
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,151
between hackers
and the companies they've torched.

477
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,219
Meanwhile, Restil's agent claims
a client Iist of over 300,

478
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,458
one of whom was once paid
a million dollars...

479
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,489
and a monster truck.

480
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,627
That's unbelievable.

481
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,532
It's really silly, I know.

482
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,814
I'm not even sure
if I'm going to finish it.

483
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,930
( hisses )
Shit.

484
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,036
you rang?

485
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,239
yes, I rang.

486
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,739
Why didn't you get this?

487
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,889
yeah. Oh, that...

488
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,195
I don't know.

489
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,232
Hey.

490
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,364
Hey.

491
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,068
Is it pronounced
"jooked" or "jucked"?

492
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,565
It's pronounced,
"give me back my article."

493
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,569
( man mutters )

494
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,250
Adam--! Can you give
a man a minute?

495
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,380
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,460
Er, it's just that...

497
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,226
this New Republic piece
is a fucking sieve.

498
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,691
I started with a check
on "Jukt Micronics,"

499
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,397
which is supposed to be this major
software company in California.

500
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,430
I went through every search engine
on the Web-- no matches found.

501
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,068
So I called 411
every area code in the state.

502
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,204
There's no Iisting anywhere
for a company called "Jukt Micronics."

503
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,647
Tried the California
Tax Franchise Board,

504
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,809
there's no record of taxes
ever having been paid

505
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,580
by a company
called Jukt Micronics.

506
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,645
Tried the State
Comptroller's Office,

507
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,816
no Iicense has ever been applied for
by a company using that name.

508
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,156
Then I called
all the hackers I know,

509
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,357
asking if any had heard
of a "National Assembly of Hackers,"

510
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,592
or a hacker by the name
of "Big Bad Bionic Boy."

511
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,999
Nothing.
I even tried Ian Restil himself.

512
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,129
There's no Iisting for the kid in D.C.,
Virginia, Maryland.

513
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,107
There's no record of him ever having
attended a public school before.

514
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,200
- More?
- PIease.

515
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,939
This guy Joe Hiert was described
in the GIass piece

516
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,140
as being this a former
basketball agent,

517
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,616
yet no one by that name has ever
been registered with the NBA

518
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,710
and none of my hackers
knew of him.

519
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,778
I even checked the names
of every government--

520
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,882
I was just getting some coffee.

521
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,391
I checked the names of every
government employee quoted in the piece,

522
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,332
against a book listing the names
of. every government employee

523
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:07,030
in the entire United States.
None of the GIass sources were Iisted.

524
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,037
But there is one thing
in this story that checks out.

525
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,440
What's that?

526
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,708
There does appear to be a state
in the Union named Nevada.

527
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,776
David.

528
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,184
- For Christ's sakes.
- God, I'm sorry, Stephen.

529
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:27,248
I wanted to see if you read it yet.
It was sitting right here, you know?

530
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,886
Don't hate me, okay?

531
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,556
Stephen, you shredded it.

532
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,159
I'm trying to spare you
a spanking, David.

533
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,068
you've got blind quotes
all over the place.

534
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,299
your facts are shaky.
I mean--

535
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,865
The Iine about the turnover
at DOT

536
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,934
was Iow by 4 1/2%
I checked.

537
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,173
Of course you did.

538
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,114
Rob and Aaron would kill you
over that kind of stuff.

539
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,710
This is The New Republic,
remember?

540
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,119
Nothing slides here. If you don't have
it cold, you don't turn it in, ever.

541
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,056
Okay.

542
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,719
Look, bring me your notes Iater,
and we'II go through it together.

543
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,126
There's a Iot about it
that I Iiked.

544
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,189
- Really?
- Really.

545
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,395
And get back to work, okay?
The mailroom floor needs scrubbing.

546
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,960
Okay.
Thanks, Stephen.

547
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,905
Recording: "You have one
unheard message. First message. "

548
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,284
Hi, Stephen, this is Adam Penenberg,
f.rom Forbes Digital Tool.

549
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,188
I just got done reading
your hacker article.

550
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,419
First of. all,
congratulations.

551
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,927
I mean, everybody here
just loved it.

552
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,931
But we wanted to do
a companion piece to it,

553
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,433
sort of. a "Day Two" story--

554
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,935
and I'm having some trouble
tracking down lan Restil.

555
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,462
Do you think I could get
a phone number on him f.rom you?

556
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,903
Look, I think it's good
that you tried this.

557
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,675
It's good to stretch.
I just--

558
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,275
I don't think you're writing
to your strengths here.

559
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,684
- I mean--
- Can I?

560
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,791
I'm wondering why you'd want to stray
from the things you do so well?

561
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,032
Have you noticed the way

562
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,539
Steve's phone
has been ringing Iately?

563
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,667
Did you see all those editors
at the Correspondents' Dinner?

564
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,305
- The way they were circling him?
- Is that what you want, Amy?

565
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,339
To get a bunch of smoke blown
up your ass by a pack of editors?

566
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,547
yes.
yes, it is.

567
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,648
Caitlin, he's going
to double his salary

568
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,922
freelancing Iike that.

569
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,794
These guys don't want
policy pieces anymore.

570
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,631
They want color,
they want nuance, humor.

571
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:54,126
But Amy,
you don't write funny.

572
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,672
It's a Iittle funny...

573
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,408
isn't it?

574
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,880
- I was just Iooking for Steve.
- He's in his office.

575
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,229
- you got a minute, Steve?
- yeah.

576
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,596
Do you have phone numbers
for sources on the "Hack Heaven" piece?

577
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,124
- Mm-hm, but they're at home.
- Can I get them?

578
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,400
Of course. Did I do something wrong?
Are you mad at me?

579
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,306
No, I just need
the phone numbers.

580
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,874
Okay.

581
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:40,008
Okay. Okay, I'm trying
to keep cool about all this, but--

582
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,885
you know the "Uniform Computer
Security Act," in the GIass piece?

583
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:47,288
Supposed to be under debate
in 21 state Iegislatures?

584
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,089
I just checked off 50--
no such act.

585
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,357
Beautiful.

586
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,126
And Julie Farthwork,
from the "Computer Security Center"?

587
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,430
Not too sure she exists either.

588
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:01,268
Same with Jim Ghort of the "Center
for Interstate Online Investigations."

589
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,296
Reporter:
And I've got nothing

590
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,572
on the "National Assembly
of Hackers," or "Frank Juliet."

591
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,475
Man!

592
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,003
Do you know why this is so great?
I mean, do you see the irony here?

593
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,107
The New Republic,
snobbiest rag in the business--

594
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,015
"the in-flight magazine
of Air Force One"--

595
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:19,421
and their star goes out and gets
completely snowed by a bunch of hackers.

596
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,891
I mean, God couldn't have
written this any better.

597
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,958
- Adam?
- Yeah?

598
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,563
As Iong as I'm grinding away
on this thing,

599
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,006
any chance you'd share
your byline with me?

600
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,614
Forget it.

601
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,743
We're in uncharted
territory here, Adam--

602
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,381
an online magazine
going after a giant.

603
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,756
you should have somebody
beside you to take some of the flak

604
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,694
in case this thing blows up.

605
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,823
- Gosh, that's touching.
- you're completely swamped.

606
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,164
you're behind on the Kim Polese piece.
I know it's due Friday.

607
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,260
I'II get to it.

608
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,704
Everything that I'm working
on is so-- dull,

609
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,208
and this is
spectacular.

610
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,711
Andy-- no.

611
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:19,205
It's not Iike you found the story
yourself. Kambiz handed it to you.

612
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,185
If I hadn't been at the dentist,
it might be me about to get famous.

613
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,687
So why don't you just--
share the wealth, okay? Shit!

614
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,491
That came out a Iot uglier
than I meant it. Sorry.

615
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,361
- Stephen: Hey.
- Charles: Hey.

616
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,499
Well, Ian Restil
e-mailed me right back.

617
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,739
It might be tough to put you
in touch with him directly, though,

618
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,077
or at Ieast until next week.
This is his e-mail:

619
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,346
"your story screwed up my deal,
I don't to talk to y--"

620
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,115
- Stephen: I think he meant--
- "I don't want to talk to you."

621
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:00,988
yeah. "I'm on vacation with my parents,
so Ieave me alone."

622
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:06,963
What kind of parent goes on vacation
with their kid in early May?

623
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,124
That's a good question.

624
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:13,068
I guess you have to know his mom.
She's a Iittle quirky.

625
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:17,164
That's his e-mail address,
if you want to write him yourself.

626
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,105
These are all my notes.

627
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,637
That's the number for the National
Assembly of Hackers.

628
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,550
Don't be thrown if all you hear
is a dark, deep, heavy breathing.

629
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,078
It's-- I don't know,
their outgoing voicemail message.

630
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,386
Don't ask me why.

631
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,019
And then that's the number
for Jukt Micronics.

632
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,723
The chairman's name
is George Sims.

633
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,028
I can't figure why this Penenberg guy
would have such hard time finding it,

634
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,433
but you know, whatever.

635
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,528
That's the URL
to their website.

636
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,404
and then, I can't seem to find
Joe Hiert's number.

637
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,035
I was Iooking all over at home.
It's somewhere there. I know it is.

638
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,204
I'II get that to you tomorrow,
if that's okay.

639
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,577
- Sure.
- yeah.

640
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,777
He's Restil's agent.

641
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,808
Should I--
I'II give you some privacy.

642
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,150
No. Have a seat.
"650," is that Palo AIto?

643
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,214
Er, no, Silicon Valley.

644
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,694
you'II probably get
a voicemail. I usually do.

645
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,855
Recording: "You've reached
the offices of. Jukt Micronics.

646
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,024
Please leave a message. "
( beeps )

647
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,693
This is Charles Lane, I'm calling
from The New Republic magazine

648
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,568
in Washington D.C., I'd Iike to speak
to George Sims, if I could.

649
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,697
They already have
our number.

650
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,904
I guess you already have
our number. Thank you.

651
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,640
I'm sorry. We've just Iike spoken
a million times now.

652
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,171
That's actually his voice
on the answering machine.

653
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,207
Sims is so hands-on,

654
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,243
he won't even Iet his secretary
do an outgoing message.

655
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,881
Who's next?

656
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,950
Er, Penenberg.

657
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,961
Oh.

658
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,190
- ( phone ringing )
- This is Adam.

659
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,200
- Hi, it's Chuck Lane.
- Hi, Chuck.

660
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,294
- I've got a phone number for you.
- Phone number for what?

661
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,397
For George Sims, at Jukt Micronics.
you got a pen?

662
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,601
yeah, sure.

663
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,014
Okay, thanks.

664
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,612
It's a phone number
for Jukt Micronics.

665
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,286
( dialing )

666
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,860
( line rings )

667
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,561

Please leave a message. "
( beeps )

669
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,781
Do me a favor.

670
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:45,049
Call this number,
the same time I do, okay?

671
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,951
- Adam: Ready?
- yeah.

672
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,086
- Go.
- ( keys clicking )

673
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,122

- What did you get?

676
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,465
- It's voicemail.
- I got a busy signal. Hang up.

677
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,867
Try again, okay?

678
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,902
- Reporter: Redial.
- ( rapid beeping )

679
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,938

- Busy signal.

680
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,577

- I get a voicemail. Hang up.

681
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,256
A major software company
with one phone Iine?

682
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,656
( baby cooing )

683
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,859
Caterina:
How are you doing?

684
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,890
Good.

685
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:34,870
- He's up to 103**.
- Oh, shit.

686
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,237
Come here, buddy.

687
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,941
- Should I give him a bath?
- That would be great.

688
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,140
- yeah.
- ( phone ringing )

689
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,376
How are you doing?

690
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,876
Hello?

691
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,252
Hello, this is George Sims.
May I speak with Charles Lane?

692
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,849
One moment, please.

693
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,656
Honey,
it's George Sims.

694
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,190
Oh.

695
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,256
I'II take him.

696
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,894
Come on, sweetheart.
yes, yes...

697
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,200
Charles:
Hello?

698
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,672
Yeah, this is George Sims,
f.rom Jukt Micronics.

699
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,733
Am I speaking
with Charles Lane?

700
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,438
Mr. Sims, thank you
for calling me back.

701
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,915
I don't have time f.or this actually.
We're trying to have an office party.

702
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,541
Uh-huh.

703
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,246
Look, if. you were calling
f.or a comment on your story,

704
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,687
I don't have one,

705
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,055
other than to say, I wish
you'd never run the stupid thing.

706
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,526
That stuff was supposed
to be off the record,

707
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,893
and your reporter knows it,
that Glass guy.

708
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,388
- I'm calling to verify information.
- I'm not verif.ying anything.

709
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,800
Bottom line is, I'd like you guys
to basically get lost, okay?

710
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,635
- ( line clicks )
- Hello?

711
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,267
- Hey.
- David.

712
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,212
- I'm sorry, Steve.
- Shit.

713
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,375
I didn't mean to startle you.
I thought you'd Iike a cup of coffee.

714
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,885
- What are you doing here?
- Working late.

715
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,513
Working on my article,
so I don't get shredded again.

716
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,648
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

717
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:04,627
I always forget to ask you.
How are your studies coming?

718
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,295
Their fine.
I'm-- just buried.

719
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,459
you're buried.
Right.

720
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,662
Okay. I should probably Iet you
get back to it.

721
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:16,070
- Is there anything you need?
- No. Good night, David.

722
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,734
Good night.
Thanks, Steve.

723
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,811
- ( phone rings )
- Charles: I got it.

724
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,314
- Hello?
- Chuck? it's Steve.

725
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,382
Hi, Steve.

726
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,552
Sorry to be calling
so late.

727
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,824
I was just wondering--

728
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,696
did you get a call f.rom
the Jukt guy? George Sims?

729
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:46,032
- I did, yeah.
- yeah. I was just sitting here,

730
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,401
and I realized that I'd given him
your home number

731
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:52,340
without asking you first.
And I wanted to apologize.

732
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,937
- It's fine.
- Sort of a prick, didn't you think?

733
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,709
I couldn't really tell
because he hung up so fast.

734
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,082
- Are you at home, Steve?
- No. Why?

735
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,178
I left a message
on your machine.

736
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,985
Those Forbes guys
want to talk to us again.

737
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,185
There's a conference call
at 9:00 a.m.

738
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,217
Sure.
Sounds Iike a party.

739
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,388
yeah?

740
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:18,099
- Okay, night, Chuck.
- See you in the morning.

741
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,133
( sighs )
That's weird.

742
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,509
Morning.

743
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,678
Hey.

744
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,651
- Want a Iaugh?
- Sure.

745
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,320
- The website for Jukt Micronics.
- Oh, good.

746
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,523
yeah, you might not think so
when you see what's on it.

747
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:26,128
I don't think Mr. Sims
Iiked our piece that much.

748
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:37,209
yeah. And I found this too,
from my fridge for some reason.

749
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,239
Ian Restil's agent,
Joe Hiert.

750
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,323
Stephen:
I'd like to pause f.or a moment.

751
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,560
you can't go into the world of
journalism without first understanding

752
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,795
how a piece gets edited
at a place Iike "TNR."

753
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:02,999
This is a system that Michael Kelly
brought with him from The New Yorker.

754
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,338
A three-day torture test.

755
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,037
If your article's good,
the process will only make it better.

756
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,842
If your article's shaky,
you're in for a Iong week.

757
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,941
A story comes in,
and it goes to a senior editor.

758
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,578
He, or she, edits it
on computer,

759
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,884
then calls in the writer,
who makes revisions.

760
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,119
Then the piece goes to a second editor,
and the writer revises it again.

761
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,128
Then it goes through a fact-check,
where every fact in the piece--

762
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,562
every date, every title,

763
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,997
every place or assertion
is checked and verified.

764
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,730
Then the piece goes to a copy editor,
where it is scrutinized once again.

765
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,830
Then it goes to lawyers,
who apply their own burdens of. proof..

766
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,307
Marty looks at it too. He's very
concerned with any kind of. comment

767
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,470
the magazine is making.

768
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,480
Then Production takes it, and lays
it out into column inches and type.

769
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,709
Then it goes back on paper,
then back to the writer,

770
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,275
back to the copy editor,
back to editor number one,

771
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,584
and editor number two, back to
the f.act-checker, back to the writer,

772
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,749
and back to Production again.

773
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,453
Throughout, those lawyers
are reading and re-reading,

774
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,520
Iooking f.or red f.Iags,
anything that f.eels uncorroborated.

775
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,398
Once they're satisfied, the pages
are reprinted and it all happens again.

776
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:09,235
Every editor, the f.act-checkers--
they all go through it one last time.

777
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:14,369
Now, most of you will start out
as interns somewhere.

778
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,507
And interns do a Iot of fact checking,
so pay close attention.

779
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:21,881
There's a hole
in the fact-checking system.

780
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,443
A big one.

781
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:29,289
The facts in most pieces can be checked
against some type of source material.

782
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,295
If an article's on,
say, ethanol subsidies,

783
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,093
you could check for discrepancies
against the Congressional Record,

784
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,623
trade publications,
LexisNexis,

785
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,158
and f.ootage f.rom C-SPAN.

786
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,138
But on other pieces,

787
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,199
the only source material
available

788
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,269
are the notes provided
by the reporter himself.

789
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,414
Steve?

790
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:56,475
This doesn't Iook Iike
a real business card to me.

791
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,853
yeah, I know.
That's the kind of clown this guy is.

792
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,324
He won't even pay
to have real cards made.

793
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,953
( softly )
AII right.

794
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,921
- My office at 9:00, okay?
- yeah.

795
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,826
( ringing )

796
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,236
Good morning.

797
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,299
Adam: A f.ew other people
we can't seem to locate--

798
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,277
Julie Farthwork, Frank Juliet

799
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,542
and Ian Restil's agent,
Joe Hiert.

800
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,948
We called the numbers you gave us,
got voicemails for all three.

801
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,943
And the e-mails were sent back
"No address" or "Account closed."

802
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:35,480
Really? 'Cause I've e-mailed them
about a million times each.

803
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,015
Hiert's online all day Iong.

804
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,085
Did you call these people
and get them directly?

805
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,393
No, I always Ieft messages

806
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,422
and spoke to them
when they called me back.

807
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,994
Adam: And the ref.erences in the article
to Nevada law enf.orcement officials.

808
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,834
Was Jim Ghort
the only one you spoke to?

809
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,737
- yes.
- Do you have a number for him?

810
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,834
- yeah, definitely.
- By the way, what was your basis

811
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:58,109
for writing that Jukt
was a big-time software company?

812
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,208
I didn't. That was added
by the copy desk, or during editorial.

813
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,583
Was the hackers' conference
where you met the Jukt executives--

814
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,611
That part of the article
is misleading.

815
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,646
I was never
in the Restils' home at all.

816
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,683
you weren't in Restil's home,
with the Jukt executives?

817
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,251
No, I didn't mean
to imply that I had been.

818
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,000
Sorry about that.
Did the fax come through okay?

819
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,472
yes, it did.

820
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,568
I think the address must've gotten
garbled. We can't find the site.

821
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,476
- you want to read it back to me?
- Adam: Sure.

822
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:34,348
you gave us
"members.aol.juktn.html."

823
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,852
- Wait. Was that an "M"?
- I'm sorry?

824
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,219
After Jukt, was that an "M,"
as in "Micronics"?

825
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,953
No, it was an "N",
as in "Not working."

826
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,794
- Try "M."
- Okay.

827
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,129
Stephen: Sorry about that,
I was rushing.

828
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,260
Kambiz:
Of. course.

829
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,532
But I do f.ind myself.
wondering, Stephen.

830
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,472
Why would a major software
company put their website

831
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,533
where only AOL members can
access it, as opposed to the entire Web?

832
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:03,137
I have no idea.

833
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,580
I don't have a website so I don't really
know that much about them.

834
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,913
I would trust you guys
to know better than me.

835
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:12,012
Okay. Looks Iike...

836
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,216
we have
the Jukt website up now.

837
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:27,698
I have to say, Stephen...

838
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,001
this Iooks very
suspicious to me.

839
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,099
How so?

840
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,940
Kambiz: Quite f.rankly,
it doesn't look like a real website.

841
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:38,778
It Iooks Iike a site that was--
created to fool someone.

842
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:41,909
I don't know much about computers.
Could somebody do that?

843
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,647
- Kambiz: Of. course.
- Adam: Very easily.

844
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,416
Kambiz: So easily, in f.act,
it's incredible.

845
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:49,789
Do you still want that number
for Jim Ghort? I found it in my notes.

846
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,621
yeah, sure.

847
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,062
AII right. 605, 84--

848
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,123
- Wait.
- Sorry?

849
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,034
"Six-zero-five,"
that's not Nevada.

850
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,030
Oh.

851
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,216
I guess I got him mixed up
with another source.

852
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,379
Er...

853
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,995
Sorry about that one.
Oh, you know what it was?

854
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:32,229
Jim Ghort was the guy who told me
about the law enf.orcement officials.

855
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:37,570
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm going to have to get you--

856
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,007
Steve.

857
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,443
Give him the number.

858
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,381
( faint sigh )

859
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,909
( softly )
This guy is toast.

860
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,151
Kambiz: All right, Stephen,
in light of. all this,

861
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:57,182
how conf.ident are you
in this story of. yours?

862
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,555
Are we off the record?

863
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,328
If you Iike.

864
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,894
Well, off the record--

865
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:12,237
some of the things
that you've brought up--

866
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,675
the website...

867
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,509
the idea that I was always speaking
to these people through voicemail--

868
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,642
that is, that they were
always calling me--

869
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,451
it didn't seem strange before,
but clearly,

870
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,821
there are some problems with the story.
you've pointed them out.

871
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:32,123
One portion of. it
was structured in a way that--

872
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,959
I just-- well...

873
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,595
in Iight of all this...

874
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,734
I just--

875
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,574
I'm increasingly beginning to believe
that I've been duped.

876
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,279
Stephen:
And so we hang up,

877
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,518
after he's basically Iet these guys
interrogate me for an hour.

878
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,789
And I go, "Chuck,
wh-what happened?

879
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,921
I mean, why
didn't you back me up?"

880
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,932
He goes, "I'm sorry, Steve,
I've got to protect the magazine.

881
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,991
- I mean, I'm the editor."
- Typical.

882
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:16,028
He's being such an asshole.
So I'm dead, pretty much.

883
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,063
( phone rings )

884
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,235
yes, this is Kambiz.

885
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,643
Can we have a talk here?
Just editor to editor?

886
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,275
Sure. Go ahead.

887
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:31,344
Completely off the record, and really
almost human being to human being?

888
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,083
Of course.

889
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,251
you guys have discovered something
that a troubled kid has done,

890
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,989
but I still don't know
how you plan to play it.

891
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,463
We're not in the business
of "gotcha" journalism here.

892
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,195
I have no interest in embarrassing
you or The New Republic.

893
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,931
I'm not worried about me
or the magazine. That's fair game,

894
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,599
But there's a kid here
who basically,

895
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,473
just plainly, screwed up.
Big time.

896
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,637
His reporting was sloppy,
we know that.

897
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,272
But we're trying to handle it
internally at this point,

898
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,839
just as you would.

899
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,148
Listen, we're going to run
something

900
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,984
along the Iines of,
"A trick was pulled,

901
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,616
and some very clever hackers
managed to create an illusion."

902
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,751
I can't tell you
what to print or not to print.

903
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,989
You guys are journalists.

904
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:16,465
But... he could be very hurt
by what you guys publish. His career.

905
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,491
Chuck, I understand.
I do.

906
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,834
I would hope if I made
the mistakes he made,

907
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,499
people would be
generous with me.

908
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,771
But...

909
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,438
this concerns the very field
we cover.

910
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,674
We have to run it.

911
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:35,377
And when we do, we're going to need
a comment f.rom you.

912
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,787
So given everything
that's happened,

913
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,383
how strongly are you going
to stand behind the story?

914
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,559
I'm Iooking into it.

915
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,831
It's really not that big a deal.
you got fooled by a source.

916
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,533
It happens. They'II print
a retraction, and that'II be that.

917
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:00,065
Steve, it's not Iike
it's going to hurt your career.

918
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,543
Of course, if you weren't
so distracted by your classes,

919
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:05,878
- maybe this never would've happened.
- I know, I gotta quit. you're right.

920
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:13,412
Can I speak to you
for a minute, Steve?

921
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,583
What about?

922
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,650
Let's do it in private.

923
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,766
We need to take a drive
to Bethesda.

924
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,202
- What for?
- I want to meet Joe Hiert.

925
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,302
I already told you,
nobody knows where he is.

926
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:39,179
Maybe if we go to the hotel
where he met with Restil and Sims,

927
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,581
someone will remember him,
or have some clue--

928
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,779
There were hundreds
of people there, okay?

929
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,118
These Forbes guys
want to come down on you.

930
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:49,454
They are highly suspicious about some
of the material in that article.

931
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,858
- you know that.
- yeah.

932
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,363
But they're going to go online
with their piece tomorrow.

933
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,763
- Oh.
- Okay?

934
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,563
- yeah.
- Now--

935
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:03,299
- Steve? Steve.
- yeah?

936
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,569
If we can find Hiert,

937
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,304
I can back them off
for a day or two, okay?

938
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,744
- Okay. I'II get my notes.
- Okay.

939
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,356
- Let's go.
- AII right.

940
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,595
Stephen:
We were at this table.

941
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,800
Restil sat here,
his mother was on his Ieft,

942
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,331
Hiert-- sorry,
his mother was on his right.

943
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,503
Hiert sat there,

944
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,672
but Restil wanted him closer,
so he slid his chair over.

945
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,978
Sims sat here.
He had a Iawyer next to him.

946
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,177
I forget the guy's name,
it's in my notes.

947
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,345
Somebody was smoking
at this table,

948
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,981
so Restil's mother insisted
that we move to one farther away.

949
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,150
Over there.

950
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:59,161
The Hacker Conference
was near here, right?

951
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:00,719
( cheering )

952
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,823
yeah, the building next door.

953
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,801
I don't remember from the article.
How many people were at this thing?

954
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:10,465
Stephen: It Iooked Iike a hundred,
might have been two. It's in my notes.

955
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,840
200 people? Here?

956
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,450
yeah, they moved in and out.
I mean, most of them were kids.

957
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,232
That doesn't seem
credible to me.

958
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,434
AII I know is I was here.

959
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,172
All of. us were right here.

960
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:52,204
- Excuse me sir, can I help you?
- yes, you can.

961
01:00:56,786 --> 01:01:00,153
We're Iooking into a conference
held here a couple of Sundays ago.

962
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,124
Computer hackers.
Do you remember anything Iike that?

963
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,627
Are you sure you're
in the right building, sir?

964
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,425
- yes, we're sure.
- Why is that?

965
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,590
Building's closed on Sunday.

966
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,430
AII I know is, I was here.

967
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,736
The conference was right here.

968
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,211
That's why the Restils
only stayed a few minutes, okay?

969
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,909
Because it was such
a dumb place to squeeze into.

970
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:31,409
So they went to a restaurant for dinner,
with some of Ian's hacker friends.

971
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,615
Thank you.

972
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,786
- How many?
- Huh?

973
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,658
People at the dinner.
How many?

974
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,796
About 10, I think,
including me.

975
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,930
Ian even put on a jacket.

976
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,133
- Hiert was there too?
- Yeah.

977
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,905
- Is it near here?
- yeah, it's across the street.

978
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,970
Good,
Iet's cross the street.

979
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,345
you know, I really don't Iike
the way you're treating me, Chuck.

980
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,374
It's Iike you won't even
talk to me.

981
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,613
- This is the place?
- yes.

982
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:08,556
I didn't do anything wrong, okay?
I didn't do anything wrong.

983
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,924
you saw my notes,
everything was in there.

984
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,764
I got tricked. I got fooled, I'm sorry.
What are you being so mad for?

985
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,428
- It was 10 people?
- yes.

986
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,938
- For dinner?
- yes.

987
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,202
They're closed at 3:00
on Sundays.

988
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:29,678
yeah, I know. I know, they almost
didn't Iet us in. Okay?

989
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,010
But it was a couple
of minutes before 3:00,

990
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:35,074
and Ian Iooked Iike he was about
ready to cry, and so they said okay.

991
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,814
- But for dinner?
- Go in and ask them yourself, Chuck.

992
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,915
See if they would serve
a party that came in at 2:58

993
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,188
and the answer would be yes,
because that's when we got here.

994
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,422
The Forbes guys
are gonna have all this too,

995
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,692
and dig through the records
at that office building.

996
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,529
They have surveillance cameras
and they're gonna check them.

997
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,592
I didn't do anything
wrong, Chuck!

998
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,366
I really wish
you'd stop saying that!

999
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,534
( sighs deeply )

1000
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,908
Steve...

1001
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,806
come on, anyone
can make a mistake.

1002
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,284
you know,
this is not right, Chuck!

1003
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,049
Okay, I feel really attacked.

1004
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,250
And you're my editor.
you're supposed to support me,

1005
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:19,125
and you're taking
their word against mine?

1006
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,722
you're supposed
to support me!

1007
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,072
Male reporter: Criticism
of. the President's program has been--

1008
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,234
- ( radio off )
- Leave it off.

1009
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,118
I'm sorry I yelled at you
back there.

1010
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,815
Chuck?

1011
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,463
Steve!

1012
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,990
( car horn blares )

1013
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:06,165
- Pull the goddamn car over.
- yeah.

1014
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,842
Charles:
AII right.

1015
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:22,416
There's been
so much pressure.

1016
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,694
Chuck, I didn't mean
to get anybody in trouble.

1017
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,857
Okay. Okay.

1018
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,229
you weren't
at the conference?

1019
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,170
No.

1020
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:42,667
you know, I had a description of it
from so many sources,

1021
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:46,011
I thought I had it solid.
Okay?

1022
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,539
And I wanted the piece
to have an eyewitness feel to it,

1023
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:52,384
for color-- so...
I said I'd been there myself.

1024
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,754
And everything
we just told the Forbes guys--?

1025
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,158
I'm so sorry, Chuck.

1026
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,595
I just panicked.

1027
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,628
If you want me to say
that I made it up--

1028
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,662
I will.
If that'II help you, I'II say it.

1029
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:16,536
I just want you
to tell me the truth, Steve.

1030
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,706
Can you do that?

1031
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:23,141
Lew: there might be f.acets
of. this that you're not considering.

1032
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,177
- Why are you def.ending him?
- Nobody's defending him, Chuck.

1033
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,851
- Of course you're defending him.
- He's a kid.

1034
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:33,055
He doctored his notes, Lew.
Just consider that for a second.

1035
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,359
you know?
He sat down,

1036
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,525
and he hand-wrote
a bunch of phony quotes

1037
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,830
and handed them in
as source material for the fact-check.

1038
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:43,430
- Doesn't that offend you?
- Of course it does.

1039
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,202
He also Iied to his editor.
That's supposed to offend you too.

1040
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,507
He's a confused, distraught kid
obviously, Chuck.

1041
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,708
So suspend him for a couple of months,
but Iet's not bury him.

1042
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,909
( faintly )
Suspend him...

1043
01:05:55,918 --> 01:06:00,685
There are also political considerations
to take into account here--

1044
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,385
the rest of the staff,
the way they feel about him.

1045
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:06,486
- I already know all that.
- What I'm saying is,

1046
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:11,057
if you fire him,
some of these people will Ieave.

1047
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,536
I don't know if we'd still have
a magazine at the end of the day.

1048
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,604
- Hey, Caitlin.
- Not now, David.

1049
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:27,313
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's a wreck, of course.

1050
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,616
- I want him in here, Caitlin.
- He's too scared to come in here.

1051
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,488
He thinks you want to destroy him.
He knows what he did was horrible.

1052
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,856
He knows how badly
he messed up.

1053
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:41,351
The part he's most upset about
is Iying to you, Chuck.

1054
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,422
Because he knows you took it
as a sign of disrespect

1055
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,661
instead of a panic move,
which is what it was.

1056
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,159
Think about the workload he's been
carrying-- all this and classes.

1057
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,673
He hasn't slept more than two hours
in nine months.

1058
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,268
So he got a Iittle sloppy and he Iied to
cover his tracks.

1059
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,973
- He's sick about it.
- Caitlin...

1060
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,415
the building he described,
it doesn't even exist.

1061
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,112
He just made it up.

1062
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,487
So...?

1063
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,597
Obviously
he needs some help.

1064
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,233
- He needs help.
- Just get him in here.

1065
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,602
you can't fire him.

1066
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,971
I don't think he'II survive.

1067
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,602
you don't understand,
we're all he has.

1068
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,012
you can't fire him,
Chuck.

1069
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,648
Thanks, Lew.

1070
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,331
( door closes )

1071
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,867
Would you guys excuse us
for a minute?

1072
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:47,881
( elevator signal rings )

1073
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:50,289
Man:
...watered-down stock,

1074
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:53,853
and you know, within--
Steve!

1075
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,029
What are you doing here?

1076
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,939
I'm so dead.

1077
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,409
I mean, I'm over.

1078
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:12,107
Nobody's ever going
to hire me again, are they?

1079
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:17,250
I was so sloppy,
trusting my sources like that.

1080
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,516
And then Iying about it.

1081
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:22,615
And to Chuck,
of all people--

1082
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:26,788
I mean, the one guy
who's hated me all along.

1083
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,592
I'm sure that none of this
is personal.

1084
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,861
No?

1085
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,300
Chuck keeps a Iist
in his head--

1086
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,929
everybody who's
a "Michael Kelly" person.

1087
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,134
A couple of times,

1088
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,473
I said some things
I shouldn't have said...

1089
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,774
about you.

1090
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:45,973
So now I'm on it.

1091
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,540
That's why he's so set
on killing me now.

1092
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:52,076
Well, I have to tell you, Steve,
he's within his rights.

1093
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:55,056
The things you did
were fireable offenses.

1094
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:58,526
I know, I'm not saying
that they weren't.

1095
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:03,396
I did some terrible,
terrible things.

1096
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,802
But believe me, Michael,
Chuck doesn't care about any of it.

1097
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:14,104
It's my Ioyalty to you
that he's punishing me for.

1098
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:17,601
I'm such an idiot.

1099
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,978
Now who's going to hire me?

1100
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:25,120
Steve, I have to ask you
something.

1101
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:30,117
Did you ever "cook" a piece
when I was your boss?

1102
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,061
Did you ever Iie to me?

1103
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,792
The "young Conservatives" piece,
the mini-bottles?

1104
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,395
Was that true?

1105
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,177
( phone rings )

1106
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:03,653
- Hello.
- Chuck, it's David Bach.

1107
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,058
I'm really sorry to bother you at night,
but it seemed important.

1108
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,053
It's fine.
Is there a problem?

1109
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,566
Well, I don't know.

1110
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,693
I just got off the phone
with Stephen.

1111
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,931
He sounds horrible.

1112
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,996
Did you suspend him,
Chuck?

1113
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,066
David,
what is the problem?

1114
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,978
He asked me if I would drive him
out to Dulles Iater tonight.

1115
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,574
He said he wasn't sure
he'd be safe driving by himself.

1116
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,244
I just thought I should
draw your attention to that.

1117
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,345
Did he say
where he was going?

1118
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,152
yeah, he said he'd be staying
with his family for a while.

1119
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,021
That could only be
one of. two places.

1120
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,050
His parents Iive
in Highland Park, right?

1121
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:42,825
yeah. Or his brother,
out in Palo AIto.

1122
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,993
- I'm sorry?
- His brother, at Stanford.

1123
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,663
Chuck?

1124
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,581
you had your brother pose
as "George Sims."

1125
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,319
What?

1126
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,793
The phony recording
from Jukt Micronics?

1127
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,262
It's a Palo AIto number.

1128
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:18,494
Your brother is a student at Stanf.ord.
You had him pose as Sims.

1129
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,729
- No, Sims is a real guy--
- Steve, Steve--

1130
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,431
I've talked to him a million times.
My brother and I aren't speaking--

1131
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:26,600
Stop it. you faked Sims,
you faked a website--

1132
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,906
- you faked all those voicemails--
- You don't know, Chuck.

1133
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:31,504
- Restil, Hiert, Ghort--
- You got this totally backward.

1134
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:35,074
It's all crap. I can trace it if you
make me. I'II find it all billed to you.

1135
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,745
I don't know what you're talking about.
Those are all real people.

1136
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,482
- They are?
- yeah.

1137
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,388
Look at me.

1138
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,724
And say that again.

1139
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:50,254
Those are all real people.

1140
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:56,737
Tsk... okay.

1141
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,701
I want you out of here.

1142
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,210
What?

1143
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,371
I want you out of here,

1144
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:06,745
and you can't take anything
with you.

1145
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:10,718
There are some files, okay?
I have to put them on a disk.

1146
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:13,119
- No.
- No, there are mine. Personal stuff!

1147
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,316
I don't care.

1148
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,750
I know you don't.

1149
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,193
- Can I at Ieast shut down my computer?
- Don't touch it!

1150
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,723
- I'm in the middle of a file, Chuck!
- Back away from the desk!

1151
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,861
- God damn it!
- Leave it or I will call Security!

1152
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,269
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay?

1153
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,470
Can I take my Rolodex?

1154
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,640
Steve...

1155
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,275
Can I take my Iaw books?

1156
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,446
Sure.

1157
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,584
But I'm gonna need to have
your security key.

1158
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,825
I'm not a criminal, Chuck.

1159
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,532
( slaps )
Okay?

1160
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:08,871
- I'm not a criminal.
- Oh, I heard you.

1161
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,243
Come on.

1162
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,067
Chuck...?

1163
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,745
I said I was sorry.

1164
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,273
I know.

1165
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,219
But you have to go.

1166
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,761
( door closes )

1167
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,876
Stephen's voice:
"Bond traders as a rule,

1168
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,909
do not have much time
to loaf. around.

1169
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,217
And the Wall Street
investment house, RVL,

to a particularly--"

( voice multiplies,

- No problem, Steve.

Um...

1188
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,966
The-- the thing
with George Sims?

1189

That was--

1190
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,699
the voice-- the voice that you heard
on the telephone,

1191
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:32,737
that was my brother.
I'm sorry.

1192
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,786
There really is a George Sims.

1193
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,846
I-- I've spoken to him
a million times.

1194
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,358
He just stopped talking to me.

1195
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,725
You know,
because of. the article.

1196
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:50,858
He was so mad about it.
I didn't know what to do.

1197
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,663
And the guys from Forbes were
putting so much pressure on me.

1198
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,897
you know?
And you were so mad!

1199
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:59,998
I just thought that if I could get
everybody off my back, okay?

1200
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,135
For just a day.

1201
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,702
Just a day would give me
enough time to-- go and find him.

1202
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:07,112
you can understand that,
can't you?

1203
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:10,141
( sighs )
you're fired, Steve.

1204
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,745
What?

1205
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:17,091
you're fired.
you've Iost your job.

1206
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,556
But you can't...

1207
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,016
Chuck...

1208
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,653
will you please
take me to the airport?

1209
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:57,154
( mutters )
Jesus.

1210
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,565
PIease, okay?

1211
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:02,297
you don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.

1212
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:05,795
It's fine.

1213
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,469
But I can't be by myself
right now.

1214
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,471
Okay? I'm--

1215
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:16,177
I'm afraid
of what I'm going to do.

1216
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,745
And you know,
I-- I can't get there by myself.

1217
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,351
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

1218
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,624
Now, if you feel Iike
you're a danger to yourself,

1219
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:30,688
you can sit down for a few minutes
until you feel calm enough to go.

1220
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,927
But I am not going anywhere
with you.

1221
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:36,404
But-- I'm afraid that I'm--

1222
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,906
I'm going to do something,
okay?

1223
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,369
Did you hear what I said?

1224
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,776
yeah.

1225
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,010
It's a hell of a story.

1226
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,084
Chuck, please?

1227
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:59,354
Stop pitching, Steve.
It's over.

1228
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:36,963
Mrs. Duke: "Spring Breakdown,"
"The Jungle."

1229
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:40,661
"A Fine Mess,"
"After the Fall,"

1230
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:45,071
"Peddling Poppy,"
"Cheap Suits,"

1231
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:49,202
"Kicked Out, "
"No Free Launch, "

1232
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,678
"Ratted Out,"
"State of Nature,"

1233
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:55,581
"CIutch Situation,"
"AII Wet," "PIotters,"

1234
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:59,986
"Praised Be Greenspan,"
"Monica Sells..."

1235
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:03,413
"Hack Heaven."

1236
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,522
( elevator signal rings )

1237
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:12,698
What the hell did you do
to Steve?!

1238
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,134
He called me from his car, hysterical.
I asked him what was wrong,

1239
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,230
- he said, "Ask Chuck--"
- I f.ired him, okay?!

1240
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,636
Not suspended, fired.

1241
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:30,173
Because this wasn't
an isolated incident, Caitlin.

1242
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,049
He cooked a dozen
of them, maybe more.

1243
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:35,284
We're going to have to go
through them, you and I. AII of them.

1244
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:38,053
No, the only one was "Hack Heaven."
He told me that himself!

1245
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:41,221
If he were a stranger to you, if he was
a guy you were doing a piece about,

1246
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,754
pretend that guy told you
he'd "only done it once."

1247
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:46,028
Would you take his word for it?

1248
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,126
Of course not,
you'd dig and you'd bury him!

1249
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,262
And you'd be offended
if anybody told you not to.

1250
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:52,569
Everyone of those pieces
was fact-checked. They--

1251
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,371
So was "Hack Heaven"!

1252
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:00,140
you're a good reporter.

1253
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:04,345
you've always been a smart, thorough
reporter. Why can't you be one now?

1254
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:07,082
Because what you're telling me
is impossible, Chuck.

1255
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,317
Go upstairs.

1256
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:12,952
- Read them again.
- This is bullshit!

1257
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,985
Make sure you go
all the way back,

1258
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:18,625
because half of them ran
when Mike was still here.

1259
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,000
That's what this is.
Of course.

1260
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:25,666
What are you going to do, Chuck,
pick us off, one by one?

1261
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,403
Everybody that was Ioyal to Mike,
so you have a staff that belongs to you?

1262
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,638
Is that the kind of magazine
you want to run?

1263
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,012
When this thing blows, there isn't
going to be a magazine anymore.

1264
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:36,176
If you want to make this about Mike,
make it about Mike.

1265
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,344
I don't give a shit.
you can resent me,

1266
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,616
you can hate me,
but come Monday morning,

1267
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,919
we're all going to have to answer
for what we Iet happen here.

1268
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,859
We're all going to have
an apology to make!

1269
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:49,159
Jesus Christ! Don't you have any idea
how much shit we're about to eat?

1270
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,927
Every competitor we ever took a shot at,
they're going to pounce.

1271
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,801
And they should.
Because we blew it, Caitlin.

1272
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,135
He handed us fiction after fiction

1273
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,641
and we printed them all as fact.

1274
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:05,670
Just because...
we found him "entertaining."

1275
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,077
It's indefensible.

1276
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:13,952
Don't you know that?

1277
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:55,125
- Is everyone in the conference room?
- GIoria: Um-hm.

1278
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,263
you know what could've prevented
all this, don't you?

1279
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:02,235
No. What?

1280
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,296
Pictures.

1281
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,502
How could you
make up characters

1282
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,444
if everyone you wrote about
had to be photographed?

1283
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,880
You know, Stephen...

1284
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:23,982
if you wanted to, you could
do these kids a giant favor.

1285
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:26,323
- yeah?
- yeah.

1286
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,967
you could write something boring
one of these days.

1287
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:36,095
Give them a little less
to live up to.

1288
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,666
I suppose I could.

1289
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:43,438
Mrs. Duke: We don't want a bunch
of teenagers getting ulcers, do we?

1290
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,605
( brief giggle )

1291
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,349
( softly )
Good morning.

1292
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,080
( faintly )
Hi.

1293
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,705
It's funny...

1294
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:21,907
...because I thought I was going
to have to explain all this to you.

1295
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,413
Well, what do you think
of this guy?

1296
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:35,021
( applause rises )

1297
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,664
Thank you.

1298
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,171
Thank you.

1299
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:54,477
( faintly )
Thank you, everybody.

1300
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:03,453
Thanks.
Thank you.

1301
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,891
( applause continues )

1302
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,574
( applause fades )

1303
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,214
Charles' voice:
Steve?

1304
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,379
Stephen?

1305
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,549
We've read through
all the pieces now,

1306
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:41,926
the entire staff, and we've
come up with a Iist of those

1307
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:45,296
whose facts and sources
we couldn't verify independently.

1308
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:49,336
I know you can't admit
guilt of. any kind,

1309
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:52,100
but I want you to confirm
a few titles for me.

1310
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,506
We're not prepared
to confirm or deny anything--

1311
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:57,102
What I'm going to do is this.

1312
01:26:57,145 --> 01:27:00,706
I'm going to read to you a Iist
of suspicious titles, one by one.

1313
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:04,543
If you raise an objection
to a particular title,

1314
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:08,317
we'll f.act-check it again in the hope
of. removing it f.rom the list.

1315
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:12,816
If you remain silent,
we'II assume that piece is fabricated--

1316
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,763
either partially or entirely,
and it will stay on.

1317
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:20,632
Is that clear to everyone?

1318
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,498
Okay.

1319
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,665
"Hazardous
To your Mental Health."

1320
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,982
That means it stays
on the Iist of suspicious pieces.

1321
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:38,178
Fabricated pieces.

1322
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:41,655
Attorney: We understand.
Can we move along?

1323
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:43,782
( pen scratches )

1324
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:46,350
Charles:
"Holy Trinity. "

1325
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,859
( pen scratches )

1326
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,870
"Probable Claus"?

1327
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:01,501
( pen scratches )

1328
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:05,309
"Don't You Dare. "

1329
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:07,770
( pen scratches )

1330
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:10,283
"Spring Breakdown. "

1331
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:14,845
"State Of. Nature. "

1332
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,024
"Rock The Morons. "

1333
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:26,398
"After The Fall... "

1334
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:28,664
Stephen's voice: You have to know
who you're writing f.or,

1335
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:31,035
and you have to know
what you're good at.

1336
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,404
I record what people do.

1337
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,103
I f.ind out what moves them,
what scares them,

1338
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,941
and I write that down.

1339
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,504
That way they're the ones
telling the story.

1340
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:42,573
And you know what?

1341
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:45,085
Those kinds of. pieces
can win Pulitzers too.

1342
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:48,248
Charles:
Steve?
