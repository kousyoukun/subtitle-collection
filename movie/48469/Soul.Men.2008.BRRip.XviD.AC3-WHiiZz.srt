1
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:05,649
Marcus Hooks
and the Real Deal, take 6.

2
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:07,686
- That's three names.
- You want me to sing the main line?

3
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:10,313
Oh, yeah, here we go, here we go.

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,823
<i>Tonight we take a musical journey south,</i>

5
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:15,861
<i>where the legendary soul band
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

6
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,862
<i>developed their signature sound.</i>

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,329
1, 2!

8
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:26,398
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

9
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:30,203
<i>They started out singing for pennies
on the street corners of Memphis.</i>

10
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:32,910
Pull the string

11
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,470
And I'll wink at you

12
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm your puppet

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:41,249
Mm-hmm, yeah

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,254
I'll do funny things

15
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:45,790
If you want me to

16
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:47,587
I'm your puppet

17
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:53,629
I'm yours

18
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,430
To have and to hold

19
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:59,061
Darling, you've got

20
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:00,969
Full control

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,803
Of your puppet

22
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,276
<i>But by 1972,</i>

23
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:06,834
<i>Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

24
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:10,144
<i>had become one
of the biggest R&B acts in the world.</i>

25
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:13,310
Nothin' like sweet soul music

26
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:15,320
To bring us together

27
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:17,982
<i>They played to sellout houses
all over the world.</i>

28
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,752
<i>They'd sold 6 million records</i>

29
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:22,487
<i>and influenced a generation
of American musicians.</i>

30
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,395
Dance to the sweet soul music

31
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:26,396
Yahh

32
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:29,434
<i>But that all ended on July 24, 1977,</i>

33
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:31,470
<i>when Marcus Hooks
began his solo career</i>

34
00:01:31,537 --> 00:01:34,506
<i>with a dramatic concert
at New York's Madison Square Garden.</i>

35
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,201
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,073
<i>Marcus Hooks.</i>

37
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:48,577
Marcus.

38
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:49,678
Ooh-ooh-ooh

39
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:51,950
Hey, boy, hi.

40
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:53,457
Hey, boy, dance.

41
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:54,618
Yeah.

42
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:56,685
<i>But while Hooks
became a music legend,</i>

43
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:59,492
<i>the journey took
a decidedly different direction</i>

44
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:02,261
<i>for former band mates
Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds.</i>

45
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,131
<i>Renowned for their
signature dance stylings</i>

46
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,901
<i>from their one
breakout hit, "Walk in the Park,"</i>

47
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,466
<i>the duo broke up in 1979.</i>

48
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,034
<i>Citing creative differences</i>

49
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:15,979
<i>and a desire to pursue separate projects.</i>

50
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,141
Back off! Freeze!

51
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:19,479
Get your hands up! Let me see them!

52
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:21,679
Oh. Wait. Wait, wait.
It ain't... Ohh!

53
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:24,552
The gun ain't real! Ow! It ain't real! Ow!

54
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,319
I'm just broke, God it!

55
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:27,916
I ain't tryin' to hurt no!

56
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,461
Watch your damn hands!

57
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:30,995
Police mother brutality!

58
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:32,428
<i>While Floyd Henderson...</i>

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,595
Come on down to Floyd's Car Wash,

60
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:38,728
where everything is done by hand.

61
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:40,567
<i>...combined his showmanship</i>

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,835
<i>with an entrepreneur spirit.</i>

63
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:45,035
And don't forget about
Super Soul Sundays,

64
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,204
with a full body wash

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,339
to guarantee a free rimjob.

66
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:54,077
Come on. Get your rimjob.

67
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:55,245
Come get your rimjob.

68
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:57,585
Come and get your rimjob!

69
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,683
<i>Whatever happened
to the forgotten duo...</i>

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,159
<i>The Real Deal?</i>

71
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:07,695
Baby, turn the navigation on.

72
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,429
I hope we can find this place
sometime tonight.

73
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:12,095
He gonna love it there.

74
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,196
They got Craftmatic adjustable beds,

75
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:16,298
clap-on lamps.

76
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,206
Y'all better shut up back there,
I'm tellin' you.

77
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,471
I'm gonna reach back there

78
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:22,013
and pop one of them little boys
upside the head so bad.

79
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,244
I think that's it, Uncle Floyd.

80
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:28,080
Whoo!

81
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,987
Now, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this bullshit.

82
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:34,049
What you talking about?
It's beautiful. You don't like this?

83
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,218
It's a death camp.

84
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:37,626
Oh, how is it a death camp, Unc?

85
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:39,824
We got 36 holes of golf.

86
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,526
Three swimming pools.

87
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,500
You know the ratio
of women to men here

88
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,163
is 5 to 1, Unc? 5 to 1.

89
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:47,535
That mean you got 'em everywhere.

90
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:48,868
You can't even move.
There's women...

91
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,408
Every time you look around,

92
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,535
women crawling between your legs,
arms, anything.

93
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,444
I mean, damn, Unc.
And if you're worried about the business,

94
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:56,538
I got that.

95
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:58,344
You taught me everything you know.

96
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,009
Yeah.

97
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,054
Yeah. You know something, son?

98
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:03,088
You're real crafty.

99
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:04,087
Appreciate that.

100
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,646
See, first you move into my house.

101
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,420
Then you take over my business.

102
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:09,017
- Aw, man, I ain't taking...
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,756
Then you move me
all the way out to the Valley, man,

104
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,354
so can't nobody hear me scream. Right?

105
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,797
Actually, that's why
we're moving you here.

106
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,858
So the nurses can hear your ass scream.

107
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,301
You remember you fell on that floor
for three days

108
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,339
- and couldn't nobody hear you.
- I remember.

109
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:24,740
Yeah. Now, stop being bitter, man.
Enjoy yourself, Unc.

110
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,574
There are your golden years, player.

111
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:30,273
Now, come on
in the house and say bye

112
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,010
to Charlene and the kids.

113
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:34,542
Fuck them kids.

114
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,645
Fuck the kids?

115
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:37,814
Yeah.

116
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:11,849
Ohh...

117
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,997
- Ohhh... yeah, baby.
- Ohh! Ohh!

118
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,161
Ohh! Oh, give it to me.
Give it to me nice and hard.

119
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,671
<i>Oh, ¡papi, sil Ooh!</i>

120
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,900
Oh, right there!

121
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:30,635
Ohhhhh!

122
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,200
Uhh! Ohh!

123
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,906
Ooh. Don't stop, baby.

124
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,141
No.

125
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,649
No, you're not getting away.

126
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:39,979
Hoo hoo! Hoo hoo!

127
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:40,984
Yummy!

128
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,918
Uhh! Uhh! Yeah.

129
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:47,381
Aah!

130
00:05:58,904 --> 00:05:59,962
Mmm...

131
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,503
How's the hip?

132
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,703
Fine.

133
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,804
Okay.

134
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:19,017
Okay, Mr. Henderson.
I'm gonna need you

135
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,685
to, uh, stands up, face the window,

136
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,455
and bend over the table.

137
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,326
My problem ain't back
in that area, doctor.

138
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,592
Look, Mr. Henderson,
your sleep problem

139
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,134
can be a symptom of a myriad
of different conditions,

140
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:31,430
some of which, you know, are...

141
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:33,699
well, you know, back in that area.

142
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,244
I don't like nobody
behind me like that, Huds.

143
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,074
I'm telling you, I just don't like
nobody playing

144
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:42,807
- with my penny.
- I'll be very gentle.

145
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:44,372
I'll be in and out before you know it.

146
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:49,479
Just bend over. There you go.

147
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:52,183
Hold on, now. Get a good grip.

148
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:53,190
Ohh...

149
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,658
Just relax.

150
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:55,659
Relax.

151
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:56,786
Sittin' on

152
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:59,126
The dock of the bay

153
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,130
Watching the

154
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,225
Tiiiiiide

155
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:05,395
Roll away

156
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,699
Ooh ooh

157
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:08,866
All right, again, Mr. Henderson,

158
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,772
there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

159
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:12,105
So take those for insomnia.

160
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:14,168
Give me a call if anything changes.
All right?

161
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,770
- All right.
- Do me a favor.

162
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,510
Stop being so hard
on yourself, Mr. Henderson.

163
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:20,211
Retirement can be a tough transition.

164
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:21,275
All right?

165
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,364
Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen.

166
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,401
Don't mix those sleeping pills with alcohol

167
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,459
unless you want to kill yourself.

168
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:42,764
Okay. Who's next?

169
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,105
<i>And for those of you in the Southland,</i>

170
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:48,442
<i>tomorrow's gonna be
another beautiful day with</i>

171
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:50,072
<i>bright, sunny skies</i>

172
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:52,413
<i>and temperatures into the mid-80s.</i>

173
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,349
<i>A perfect day for some golf.</i>

174
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,617
<i>And that's gonna continue
right into next week.</i>

175
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,591
<i>Gorgeous blue skies
and sensationally warm.</i>

176
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:02,820
<i>It doesn't get any better than that.</i>

177
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:04,988
<i>This just in.</i>

178
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,793
<i>Soul music fans around the globe</i>

179
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:10,232
<i>are mourning the loss
of Marcus Hooks.</i>

180
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:12,133
<i>The legendary singer and songwriter</i>

181
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:14,570
<i>apparently suffered
a massive heart attack</i>

182
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,268
<i>while performing last night
in front of a capacity crowd</i>

183
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:20,244
<i>at Kungstrardgarden Park
in Stockholm, Sweden.</i>

184
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:22,837
<i>His body's being
flown home to New York,</i>

185
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,008
<i>where a memorial service
will be held next week.</i>

186
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,416
<i>The seven-time Grammy Award winner</i>

187
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,613
<i>was 63 years old.</i>

188
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:32,350
<i>I'll do anything for you</i>

189
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>We're back in just a moment.</i>

190
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,456
Humh!

191
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:39,960
Kezian Motors. Can I help you?

192
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,289
Who?

193
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,235
Hinds, telephone!

194
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:52,976
Dealing drugs out of my garage?

195
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:56,173
Listen, you doing something illegal,

196
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:59,081
I'll find out and send your ass
back to prison

197
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:02,484
so fucking fast, it will make
your black monkey head spin.

198
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:07,686
You know, there was a time

199
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,387
I would've knocked your teeth
down your throat

200
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:10,860
for saying some shit like that to me.

201
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,260
But I'm a changed man.

202
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,356
I'm trying to be
all centered and shit.

203
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:17,425
Now, I could'a called you
a unibrow-shaving, pilaf-eating,

204
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,300
greasy-ass goat fucker,
but I didn't, did I?

205
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,566
- Uh-uh.
- 'Cause I didn't want to hurt your feelings,

206
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,232
and I didn't want to piss you off,

207
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,538
just like I know
deep, deep down inside,

208
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,545
you don't want to piss me off, either.

209
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:28,545
- Now, do you?
- Uh-uh.

210
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:29,979
Uh-uh. No. Uh-uh.

211
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,175
All right.

212
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,945
Peace.

213
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:36,616
Scruffy, Kibbles...

214
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,247
Yeah, this is Louis.

215
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:40,120
Hey. Mr. Hinds.

216
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,490
It's Danny Epstein
calling from New York. How are you today?

217
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,858
<i>Who?</i>

218
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:44,861
Marty's son.

219
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,192
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

220
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:47,892
Shit,

221
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,763
I ain't seen you since you were in diapers.

222
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:50,767
<i>Yeah. Well,</i>

223
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:51,768
I assume you heard

224
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:53,168
about Marcus' passing, yeah?

225
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:56,674
Oh, yeah. I'm crying the tears
of a motherfucking clown.

226
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:59,108
Okay. Here's the thing.
VH1 is putting together

227
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:00,941
a farewell tribute at the Apollo,

228
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:03,106
<i>and they got a lot of big names lined up.</i>

229
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:05,173
And they want Henderson and Hinds
to perform, right?

230
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,718
That's right! The Real Deal
back together again.

231
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:09,083
<i>It's a great opportunity.</i>

232
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:10,678
You talk to Floyd?

233
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,223
<i>I did.</i>

234
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,781
Mr. Henderson is in.

235
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:14,791
<i>Good.</i>

236
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,259
Then I'm out.

237
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,597
<i>Born under a bad sign</i>

238
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,640
<i>Been down since I began to crawl</i>

239
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,813
<i>If it wasn't for bad luck</i>

240
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:41,080
<i>You know I wouldn't have
no luck at all</i>

241
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:47,223
<i>Hard luck and trouble...</i>

242
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,380
That is disgusting.

243
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:14,885
Ooh!

244
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:19,815
I don't believe this. Hmm.

245
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,257
Hey!

246
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,315
Uhh!

247
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,199
Ohh. Damn!

248
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:39,608
Ooh. Fuck happened, man?

249
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:42,841
Hell if I know. I came in,
found your ass laying there.

250
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,076
Bullshit.
You looked me dead in my eyes.

251
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,208
Man, you recognized me.

252
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,809
I didn't recognize you.
You done changed.

253
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,148
I come all the way down here,

254
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:51,655
and, man, you gonna
look me in my face

255
00:11:51,723 --> 00:11:53,691
- and knock me the fuck out?
- Should've called first.

256
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,817
How the hell I'm gonna call

257
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:55,985
and you ain't got no phone?

258
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:58,029
What kind of person
ain't got no land phone?

259
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,893
Kind of person don't want to get no calls.

260
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,455
You don't even know
why I came down

261
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,797
to this old fucked-up-the-ass
neighborhood.

262
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:06,360
I talked to little Ep.
I know why you're here.

263
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:08,804
And the answer is no.

264
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:11,866
Did he tell you we're at the Apollo
and they sold out?

265
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,878
Did he also tell you
who gonna be there?

266
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,972
Booker T. Jones. Isaac Hayes.
Bootsy Collins.

267
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:17,981
Shakira.

268
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,039
I don't care.

269
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:20,744
Do it for Marcus.

270
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,081
Fuck Marcus.

271
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:23,382
Well, do it for me.

272
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:25,355
- Fuck you!
- Come on, man.

273
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:27,016
- This is our shot.
- At what?

274
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,583
At a comeback, fool.
If we do this shit right,

275
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,891
we can get a record deal
and get back on the road

276
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,488
like we was 30 years ago.

277
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:35,294
I ain't trying to be like 30 years ago!

278
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,834
I ain't trying to make no comeback.

279
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,097
I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.

280
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,137
Don't make me beg you, man.

281
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:49,136
Lao-Tzu says, "Free from desire,
"you realize the mystery.

282
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:52,581
"Caught in desire,
you see only the manifestations. "

283
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,242
What the fuck
that even mean, man?

284
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,947
That means...

285
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:02,257
get the fuck out.

286
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,860
Well, I guess you don't give a fuck
about the money, then, huh?

287
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:11,800
What money? It's a funeral!

288
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,134
Nobody get paid to sing
at no damn funeral!

289
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:16,606
How much?

290
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,040
40 grand.

291
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,771
Apiece?

292
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,039
No, down the middle.

293
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:24,139
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no!

294
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,444
That ain't even enough.

295
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:27,382
What the fuck you mean
that's not enough, man?

296
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:30,580
I got a lifestyle to maintain here.

297
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,248
What kind of lifestyle, man,

298
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:33,848
you filthy motherfucker?

299
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:36,622
You got a pantry full of dog food.
I don't see no dog.

300
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,219
Dog under the bed,
nigger! You lucky

301
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,060
he ain't attacked your ass
when you came in.

302
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:42,123
You're the dog, motherfucker!

303
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:47,203
Look, man, what happened to all
that fucking money you done saved, man?

304
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:49,502
Saved? Shit.

305
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:52,042
I don't remember shit from Watergate

306
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,634
to when the space shuttle blew up.

307
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:54,872
Hmm. Money I saved.

308
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,471
Okay, what about the royalties?
I used to get

309
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:58,311
over $30,000 a year off that shit.

310
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:01,147
I lost my royalties in a poker game.
All right?

311
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:03,449
- Poker?
- Listen here, man.

312
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,683
If you serious about un-assing me

313
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,725
from my lavish surroundings here,

314
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,693
man, you gonna have to be
a little more flexible

315
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,855
in your thinking. Say, oh...

316
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:13,955
60/40.

317
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:16,125
Man, you must be higher
than a motherfucker.

318
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:18,635
We always split shit
straight down the middle.

319
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:20,331
Ain't gonna be nothing to split

320
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:21,667
if I don't show up, now, is there?

321
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,039
And I ain't showing up
unless I get 60%% % of the proceeds.

322
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,338
You rich anyway, motherfucker.

323
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:29,209
I seen your little car wash
commercials on the TV.

324
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:32,079
I transferred all my business affairs
over to my nephew.

325
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,175
- I'm on a fixed income, man.
- So what?

326
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,152
So your drawers!

327
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,882
That's why that 20 damn
thousand dollars

328
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:39,890
- look good to me right now.
- 16!

329
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,859
That's your cut of a 60/40 split.

330
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:44,418
And those are my terms.

331
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,464
And they're non-negotiable.

332
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,293
55/45.

333
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:00,340
Fatherfuck you, man.

334
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:03,142
You're gonna tell me 60/40.

335
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:05,012
You don't dictate to me!

336
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,517
I'm Floyd motherfucking Henderson.

337
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,110
You and Marc, I made you

338
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,711
and that motherfucker!

339
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:13,986
You can't sing, hum,
or motherfucking skip.

340
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,390
Ain't that a bitch?

341
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,257
Skip on these motherfucking nuts!

342
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,864
You and Marcus, may you rest in shit.

343
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:22,627
Motherfucker.
I'm Floyd fucking Henderson,

344
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,896
you Apostle-faced motherfucker!

345
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:28,529
This motherfucker slams this door
in my face one more time...

346
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,199
I'm tired of this motherfucker!

347
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,640
Always had a problem with this bitch.

348
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,639
He ain't nothing. He's ignorant!

349
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,876
Motherfucker's just a idiot.

350
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,418
Chihuahua-head motherfucker, man,
sitting up there,

351
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:43,579
always want to tell
somebody what to damn do.

352
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:46,089
He gonna sit there and talk the fool?

353
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:48,991
Ooh, my blood pressure's
high, motherfucker.

354
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,153
Huh!

355
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,368
Don't let this motherfucker
get you like this.

356
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:01,194
Huhh!

357
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:05,735
What!

358
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,800
Stay!

359
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:15,418
First of all, I clearly want
to state this for the record.

360
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,615
And I find this arrangement we got,
man, despicable.

361
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,284
But I'm Floyd Henderson.
I'm a trouper.

362
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,759
And you know I'd do
any doggone thing, man,

363
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,660
to see this group get back on its feet,

364
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,595
'cause you know
that's the type of motherfucker I am.

365
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,133
But in the meantime,

366
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:32,830
I'm going back
to my $600-a-night hotel room,

367
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,668
and I'm gonna have me
a nice hot bubble bath

368
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,265
to wash some of this
filth and dirt and grime

369
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:41,403
from this black
fucking hole you live in.

370
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,916
Then I'm having me
a nice, juicy-ass steak, oh, yeah,

371
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,747
the size of your
motherfucking back.

372
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:50,913
Then I'm gonna take me
a shit shower and shave.

373
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,957
And I'll be here at 6 a. m.

374
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,491
To take you to the motherfucking
airport.

375
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,753
You got me? I don't fly.

376
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,055
And I get up at 8.

377
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:01,497
My cousin out the penitentiary,

378
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,397
I'm gonna have him kill
this motherfucker!

379
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,064
Man talk to me like
I'm a motherfucking kid.

380
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,265
I ain't no motherfucking kid.

381
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,672
Every time we... we start on the road,

382
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:13,506
he starts in saying the same shit.

383
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,976
Hey! Who's got my lunch?

384
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:16,979
Who are you?

385
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,106
I'm Phillip Newman, sir,

386
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:19,514
the new intern. You hired me,

387
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,778
like, 20 minutes ago.

388
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:22,319
Chuckles Newman's my uncle.

389
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:23,718
- He's the one that told you...
- Stop talking.

390
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:25,449
Very good. I already got a job for you.

391
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,082
Okay? Bing, bang, boom.
Look at that.

392
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,650
Yeah. Henderson and Hinds,
Marcus' old backup singers,

393
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,559
are being real dickheads
about this tribute thing...

394
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,825
Oh, my God! Henderson and Hinds!
The Real Deal.

395
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:35,491
They're the only band
that got to play three songs

396
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,966
<i>on a sing episode of Soul Train.</i>

397
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,697
Don Cornelius was there as a witness,
and I got it on VHS.

398
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,295
They don't do that here. All right?

399
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,034
- Yes, sir.
- This is a record label,

400
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,166
not a fan club.

401
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:46,210
I want those two old fucks
there on Saturday,

402
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:47,905
and I want you to make that happen.

403
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:48,911
Got it?

404
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:18,508
The Real Deal is back,
and they not gonna stop us now.

405
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:19,942
Uh-huh.

406
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,603
Ohh! Shit.

407
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,669
Ohh...

408
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,115
What the fuck is that, man?

409
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,582
This is a gun.

410
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:28,881
I never travel through Klan country
without one.

411
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,444
- You got a problem with that, pops?
- Yeah,

412
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:31,682
I got a problem with that, man.

413
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,155
The last time I saw that gun,

414
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:34,749
you were pointing at me,
and you were shooting it.

415
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:37,056
Listen here, Floyd.
We ain't two old friends

416
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:38,186
out for some Sunday drive

417
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:39,560
down Memory Lane. All right?

418
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,532
Fact is, I can hardly stand
the sight of your ass,

419
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,967
so you best not to provoke me.

420
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,162
Or what's gonna happen?

421
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:47,899
There's a lot of empty road

422
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,168
between here and where we trying to go.

423
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,368
Where a nigger could disappear

424
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:53,206
and where nobody'd
miss his black ass.

425
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,946
Well, let me see that gun.

426
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,741
Let me see it!

427
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:01,080
Be careful, fool.

428
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:03,120
You don't think I know
how to hold a gun, man?

429
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:04,780
I'm a member of the NRA, man.

430
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,483
Ohh!

431
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,651
Where's... Now, what's... God damn it!

432
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:09,659
Oh! Shit!

433
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,057
- Damn!
- Ohh!

434
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,430
Drive! Drive!
God damn it it, drive!

435
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,467
- Ohh!
- Help me!

436
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:17,660
Aaahh!

437
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:18,964
Grab the wheel, fool!

438
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:22,165
- Look out!
- Now, turn! Turn!

439
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:25,174
Ohh!

440
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:27,040
What the hell is wrong with you!

441
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:28,943
Don't shoot no gun in a car!

442
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,778
You said... The safety
wasn't on there.

443
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,647
Safety, my ass!

444
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,117
Safety wasn't...

445
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,175
Ohh...

446
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:38,956
NRA!

447
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,958
Negro Retards' Association!

448
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,960
Dumb motherfucker.

449
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,087
What the fuck is that?

450
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,889
R- E-S-P-E-C-T.

451
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,026
Been a long time
since we saw our name in lights.

452
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,761
What our name doing up in lights?

453
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,928
We're at the Apollo Theater
this weekend.

454
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:29,269
We ain't been on stage
in over 30 years.

455
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,933
Now, the last thing you want to do

456
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:32,636
is stink up the joint. Am I right?

457
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:34,372
And I got us free dinner to boot.

458
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,355
Man, we sure are lucky
I kept these threads.

459
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:46,947
Do we look good!

460
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:49,220
Better hope that button
don't pop off and kill nobody.

461
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:53,688
God damn, I wish these pants
weren't squeezing my nuts so tight.

462
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:55,596
Maybe it'll help you
hit those high notes.

463
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,227
I don't need help
hitting the high notes.

464
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:00,601
Yeah, right. We'll see. We'll see.

465
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:05,071
Ha ha! Busting out.

466
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:07,101
Ladies and gentlemen,

467
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,169
tonight, the Flagstaff Motor Inn

468
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,909
is proud to present
to you back onstage

469
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,144
for the first time
in nearly three decades

470
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:17,188
the unforgettable
sweet soul sounds of...

471
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,420
The Real Deal!

472
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:25,724
Whoo!

473
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:35,737
Don't you ever

474
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,436
Be sad

475
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,637
Lean on me

476
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:42,373
When times are bad

477
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:45,382
When the day comes

478
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,350
And you are down

479
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:49,546
In a river of trouble

480
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,589
And are about to drown

481
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,487
Just hold on

482
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:56,459
I'm coming

483
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:58,689
Hold on

484
00:21:58,763 --> 00:21:59,957
I'm coming

485
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,297
On my way

486
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:05,302
Your lover

487
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,361
When you be cold

488
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,531
I'll be your cover

489
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,871
Don't have to worry

490
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:14,138
- 'Cause I'm here
- Yeah.

491
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:16,339
No need to summon me there

492
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:17,779
'Cause I'm here

493
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:19,009
Yea-ah

494
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,812
Hold on

495
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:22,409
I'm coming

496
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:25,149
Yipes!

497
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:27,316
I'm coming

498
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,189
Just hold on

499
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,992
I'm coming

500
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:34,258
Just hold on

501
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:35,390
I'm coming

502
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:40,336
Look here. Reach out to me

503
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:42,771
for some satisfaction.

504
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:46,034
You know, Floyd, all she got to do

505
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,874
Is call my name

506
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:51,472
For quick reaction

507
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:53,141
Yeah, yeah, yeah

508
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,184
Yeah

509
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:56,185
Ooh! Aah!

510
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:57,516
Ooh!

511
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:59,716
Ooh! Ooh, ooh! Ooh!

512
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,122
Aaah!

513
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:05,352
Lou, Lou, you all right?
You all right?

514
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,160
I can't breathe!

515
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,461
Louis.

516
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:11,229
Ohh!
Keep going. Keep going.

517
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:12,234
I can't breathe.

518
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
please forgive us

519
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:21,002
for this technical difficulty.

520
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,478
Ow!

521
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:23,844
Aah!

522
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:25,746
Fucking eye, man!

523
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,842
I'm sorry, man.
I got on these tight slacks!

524
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,648
Well, then, I'll sue your fat ass!

525
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:30,688
You sue these nuts.

526
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:32,518
- Go on, get on outta here.
- Jesus!

527
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,750
Take it from the top.

528
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:35,224
How are we gonna
take it from the top?

529
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:36,658
- I'm rewed up to go, man,
- You can't hardly breathe.

530
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:37,922
- You may need a chest X-ray.
- I'm good!

531
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:39,190
Is there a doctor in the house?

532
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,164
I love you, Debbie.

533
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:43,393
Get off me, Ernest T!

534
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:45,197
Lou. Lou. Lou. Calm down, man.

535
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,897
Ain't but 12 motherfuckers out here, man.

536
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,495
It's still a audience!

537
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:50,734
I don't care if it's two or three.
It's a audience.

538
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:51,900
That's what I'm talking about.

539
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,375
Your attitude is fd up.

540
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:55,708
Same thing that messed us up
back in the day.

541
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,907
No. You know what fucked our shit up
back in the day?

542
00:23:57,982 --> 00:23:58,914
No. I don't know.

543
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:00,348
Oh, you know goddamn well

544
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:01,680
what fucked our shit up back in the day.

545
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,414
- Oh, I do, huh?
- Yes, you do!

546
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:05,353
What fucked our shit up
back in the day

547
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:09,120
was you sticking your johnson
in my woman!

548
00:24:09,193 --> 00:24:10,922
Ooh.

549
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,440
Ladies and gentlemen,

550
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:25,737
I'm Floyd Henderson.

551
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,437
This fool is Louis Hinds.

552
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:30,106
We are The Real Deal,
and that's for real.

553
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:34,550
I want to thank you for being
a super audience here tonight.

554
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:36,484
Motherfucker.

555
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:38,784
I'm sorry I hit you, Debbie. Come back.

556
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,381
Shut the fuck up,
or I'll knock your dick in the dirt.

557
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,791
Drunk son of a bitch.

558
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:45,021
Ohh...

559
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,600
<i>Happy</i>

560
00:24:50,668 --> 00:24:52,568
Hey, Louis, are we gonna talk
about last night,

561
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:54,127
or we just gonna let it fester?

562
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,573
All right. Well, I was
a little rusty, okay?

563
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:01,236
That's a insult to rust, ain't it?

564
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:02,904
Well, what about you,
motherfucker?

565
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:05,711
Last night, look like you were
stuck in cement.

566
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:06,977
I had a hip replacement, Louis.

567
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:08,678
Well, you should've paid
a hundred more dollars

568
00:25:08,753 --> 00:25:10,778
and got the deluxe model
with some rhythm in it.

569
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:12,686
'Cause that motherfucker you got,

570
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,850
- it ain't working.
- Oh, that's fine, man.

571
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:15,984
But that's not what we talking about.

572
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,618
I'm talking about Odetta.

573
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,688
Oh.

574
00:25:19,764 --> 00:25:20,958
Louis, if I thought there was still

575
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:22,499
- gonna be a problem between us...
- You went

576
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,467
where you shouldn't have gone,

577
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:25,934
period!

578
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:27,130
Now, there's some shit

579
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:29,036
that's just etched in stone.

580
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:31,007
First and foremost is

581
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:35,478
thou shall not dig for diamonds
in another brother's mine!

582
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:38,276
Bullshit, man. You gotta take
some responsibility here.

583
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:39,441
You think she didn't know, man,

584
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:40,643
about all of your smoking

585
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:41,946
and drinking and drugs

586
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,487
and other women? She knew.

587
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:45,545
She came running to me
telling, "My man

588
00:25:45,623 --> 00:25:48,615
Louis did this. Louis did that.
Hold me, Floyd. "

589
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:50,024
All right, well, getting the pussy
is one thing.

590
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:51,527
- You ain't had to marry her.
- What?

591
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:52,995
You'd have to be a zip-down fool

592
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:54,725
to let her slide
through your fingers, man.

593
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,528
All right, well, if I'm a fool,
then you are, too.

594
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:59,365
You think I don't know that?
She hurt my heart, too.

595
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:02,998
Good!
That's a poor motherfucking comfort.

596
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:06,339
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

597
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:07,639
<i>Every night I'm telling</i>

598
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:09,236
<i>Whoopie</i>

599
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:11,372
<i>Every time you're here, you're making</i>

600
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,314
<i>- Whoopie
- Whool</i>

601
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:14,874
<i>Whoopie</i>

602
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:27,187
Well, how many times did you say
you was married after Odetta?

603
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,694
Four.

604
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:31,826
Ohh!

605
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:34,838
I married this girl named Estelle
to get over Odetta.

606
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:36,373
Then I married Henrietta.

607
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,636
She wasn't no good for me.

608
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,007
Then I married Josephine.

609
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:43,047
She definitely wasn't no good for me
because she met Carl.

610
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:45,105
All right. That's three.

611
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:46,878
Who was lucky number four?

612
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:48,782
Her name was Consuelo.

613
00:26:49,854 --> 00:26:51,481
She left me and went back to Cuba.

614
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,548
Ha ha ha!
People actually go back to Cuba?

615
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,718
She said she'd rather
spend the rest of her life

616
00:26:56,794 --> 00:26:59,126
under that dictatorship
than spend another night with me.

617
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,793
How 'bout you?
How come you never got married?

618
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:06,701
I almost hooked up
with this girl down in the Philippines,

619
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:07,760
in Manila.

620
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:11,971
- Wow.
- But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

621
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:14,136
Tagalog, and only English she knew

622
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:16,203
was, "Me love you
long time for two dollar. "

623
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:21,475
Yeah, I wasn't no good
at relationships after Odetta.

624
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:22,849
You ever hear from her?

625
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,148
Who, Mai Mai?

626
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:25,154
No. Odetta.

627
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:27,214
Oh. No, man.

628
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:29,686
I heard from her, man.

629
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,228
It was sometime around Christmas.

630
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:34,162
You know, in that place
she was living in Tulsa. You know?

631
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,467
Fuck it.
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

632
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:39,162
What you doing?

633
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:40,966
- I saw a coyote.
- Whyn't you put that thing up

634
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,335
before somebody get hurt, man?

635
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:43,771
How come you think
I don't know how to handle

636
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:45,206
- no damn piece, man?
- Think?

637
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:47,768
I know.

638
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:49,813
Yeah?

639
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:52,213
Yeah, come fuck with me now, Louis.

640
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:53,750
Come on. You think I'm soft, huh?

641
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:56,810
Yeah.
I'll bust one in your ass.

642
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:58,480
Floyd, you keep fucking around,

643
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,387
I'm gonna stick that gun
so far up your ass,

644
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,289
you gonna taste gunpowder
every time you talk.

645
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,191
- Well, let me...
- Shit!

646
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:10,831
God damn it!

647
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:12,460
Louis, that was a accident. I swear.

648
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:14,630
I'm sweating. My hand's wet.

649
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:16,138
You all right?

650
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:17,674
You warm? You hot?

651
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:19,607
You dizzy? You light-headed?

652
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:21,975
Louis, I swear I would never want
to hurt you, man.

653
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:24,276
I thought about killing you,
but I'd never want to hurt you.

654
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:26,816
<i>All right.
In our continuing tribute to Marcus Hooks,</i>

655
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:29,546
<i>we're reaching all the way back
in this next song.</i>

656
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,521
Lou. That's us, man.

657
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,581
<i>- Listen.
... Martin Hooks and The Real Deal.</i>

658
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:38,220
<i>Number 3 in 1969...
"I'm Your Puppet. "</i>

659
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,061
<i>Pull the string</i>

660
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:45,534
<i>And I'll wink at you</i>

661
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:47,400
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

662
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,370
<i>Mm-hmm, yeah</i>

663
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:53,273
<i>I'll do funny things</i>

664
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:55,972
<i>If you want me to</i>

665
00:28:56,047 --> 00:28:57,207
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

666
00:28:58,282 --> 00:28:59,306
Come on, Lou.

667
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:07,050
I'll say this for him...
that motherfucker could sing.

668
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:09,524
No doubt. No doubt.
Come on, help me... help me out.

669
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:10,686
- Second verse.
- Second?

670
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:11,887
"Pull my strings. " Kiss.

671
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:12,895
<i>...your puppet</i>

672
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:14,591
- What...
- You ready?

673
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,565
1, 2, 3.

674
00:29:16,634 --> 00:29:17,566
Hit it.

675
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:18,932
<i>Pull another string</i>

676
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:21,836
...ing, and I'll kiss your lips

677
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:23,396
I'm your puppet

678
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:25,704
<i>Ohh, ohh, ohh</i>

679
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:27,539
<i>- Tap.
- Yeah</i>

680
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:29,671
Snap your fingers

681
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:30,771
And I'll turn

682
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:32,145
You some flips

683
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:33,410
I'm your puppet

684
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:36,453
- Man, my hip hurt like anything.
- Drop step.

685
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,546
Drop step?
You know I can't do that right now.

686
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:40,556
Go, Lou.

687
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,956
- Owww!
- Man.

688
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:44,654
Oh, sweet. Do it, Louie.

689
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:45,661
<i>...do is wiggle...</i>

690
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,425
Oh! Oh! Oh!

691
00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:49,966
I'm your puppet

692
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:52,628
<i>- Oh, yes, I am
- One more time.</i>

693
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,170
<i>- There you go, Floyd.
- I'm your puppet</i>

694
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:55,432
Oh! Come on now.

695
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:56,973
<i>- Mmm, yeah
- Yeah, I got it now.</i>

696
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,030
<i>- I got it.
- Yeah</i>

697
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:00,107
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

698
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:02,475
So where'd you book us next?

699
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:03,843
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

700
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:06,878
This is it?

701
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,284
Come on, children

702
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:18,851
And gather around

703
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,864
Want y'all to see

704
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,093
We're putting down

705
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,829
It's a thing

706
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:27,768
Everybody can do

707
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:29,772
So come on, children

708
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,206
Do the boogie, too

709
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:34,210
Boogie ain't nothing

710
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:36,269
But gettin' down

711
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:38,474
Boogie ain't nothing

712
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,449
But gettin' down

713
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:49,156
I got to boogie for you

714
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:50,284
Floyd Henderson

715
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:51,726
What is it?

716
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:53,764
- Boogie on down
- Whoo-hoo!

717
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:55,059
Louis Hinds

718
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:57,862
Boogie on down

719
00:30:57,935 --> 00:30:58,993
Listen to the band

720
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,163
We'll make it through

721
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,798
All we got

722
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:06,240
Is the boogie, too

723
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:14,577
I got to boogie for you

724
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:16,813
Whoo

725
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:20,152
Hey, you, what you got, baby?
You got to boogie for me?

726
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:23,625
Come on, now.
Oh, yeah

727
00:31:23,694 --> 00:31:25,662
Come on.

728
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,664
Yeehaw!

729
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,962
Come on, fiddler.

730
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:32,127
I knew you were
gonna try to take over.

731
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:35,804
Look at him.

732
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:38,273
Go on, Lou.

733
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:40,310
- Come on.
- Oww!

734
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:42,039
Boogie ain't nothing

735
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:44,206
But gettin' down

736
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,442
Boogie ain't nothing

737
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:48,883
But gettin' down

738
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:51,615
Boogie ain't nothing
but getting down

739
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:52,781
Ow!

740
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:54,688
Boogie ain't nothing

741
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,522
But getting down

742
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:59,028
Come on.
I got to boogie for you

743
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:05,694
I got to boogie for you

744
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,204
I got nothing but boogie

745
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:10,399
- Nothing but boogie for you
- Ooh

746
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:12,135
- I got nothing but boogie
- Yeah

747
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,642
Nothing but boogie for you

748
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:16,373
- Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
- Oh, yeah

749
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:18,745
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

750
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:20,511
- Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
- Oh, yeah

751
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,415
I got to boogie for you

752
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:25,683
Aah!

753
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:33,620
Share the love, baby.

754
00:32:33,697 --> 00:32:35,892
All right, all right.

755
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:37,729
You know you pulled
the Al Green up there, right?

756
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:39,497
No, I didn't, Lou. Don't start that...

757
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,696
We barely got offstage

758
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:42,432
when you ran your ass
back out there.

759
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:45,100
Look, an encore
is at the audience's discretion.

760
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:46,734
You're supposed to wait
till they ask for it.

761
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,506
- You know they wanted it.
- I don't care what they wanted.

762
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,342
That shit was unprofessional.

763
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:51,745
Man...

764
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,016
Say,

765
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,387
I'm starting to remember
why I love the road so much.

766
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,892
Yeah.

767
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,960
Mmm.

768
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:11,092
If my instincts serve me right,

769
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,227
you're about to find
yourself another room tonight.

770
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:16,137
You know those little blue pills
make you go blind, right?

771
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,175
Mmm, mmm.

772
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:22,168
Don't call me when you get
that four-hour erection.

773
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:23,770
Hey, now, baby girl.

774
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:29,378
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

775
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:31,318
Oh. Aah!

776
00:33:31,388 --> 00:33:32,480
Yeah, give it to me.

777
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,549
Those little pills, give me strength.

778
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:36,786
A little strength.

779
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:38,761
Ugh!

780
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:40,091
I'm going to fuck your brains out.

781
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:42,928
Oh! Oh, you're heavy.

782
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:46,767
Uh,

783
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:48,964
what's wrong, baby?

784
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,301
Nothing.

785
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:53,673
I just, uh, you know, I...

786
00:33:53,744 --> 00:33:55,939
I just never been with
someone like you before.

787
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,675
It's true what they say.
But let me tell you something.

788
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:01,115
Floyd Henderson gonna be
nice and gentle.

789
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:02,880
Your first taste of dark meat

790
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,784
gonna be smooth and sweet, trust me.

791
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:06,015
No, I didn't mean that.

792
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,388
It's just, uh, you know,

793
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:11,792
I've never been with someone so old.

794
00:34:11,862 --> 00:34:13,022
Old?

795
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:15,691
You ain't no teen queen
your damn self.

796
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:17,631
Huh.

797
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:18,963
Come on, come on, come on.

798
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:20,628
Come on, mama. Come here, baby.

799
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:21,932
Baby, baby. Look here.

800
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:25,203
Let's take our decades
of sexual experience

801
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,971
and combine them for one night

802
00:34:27,044 --> 00:34:28,841
of exploration and bliss,
can we do that?

803
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:32,979
I won't disappoint you.

804
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,314
All right.

805
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:37,445
That's what I'm talking about.

806
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:38,852
I want to suck one of them titties.

807
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:41,391
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
something to show you.

808
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:42,550
- Ooh.
- Ooh, hoo.

809
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:44,821
I'm so hot, I'm about to fuck myself.

810
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:47,087
Bite my lip off.

811
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,029
Oh. Look!

812
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,532
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

813
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,193
Tonight I ain't got no
control like that no more.

814
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:56,000
Now, I hope you don't
mind a little hair.

815
00:34:56,073 --> 00:34:59,804
Baby, I found
my sexual awakening in the '60s.

816
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:03,404
Nothing I like better
than a big old fluffy...

817
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:06,843
Damn, girl.

818
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,851
That's a whole bunch of hair
you got down there.

819
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,887
Yeah, I call it the natural look.

820
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:13,253
You sick?

821
00:35:13,324 --> 00:35:15,121
I know it's big.

822
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:16,784
You need a pick.

823
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,157
You want me to shave it?

824
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:21,392
We ain't got the time or
apparatus for that type of job.

825
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:23,194
Okay, disregard.

826
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,393
Oh!

827
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:25,628
- Oh!
- Oh!

828
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:28,228
Look who's coming to dinner.

829
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:30,136
Right on time, ain't it?

830
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:31,640
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

831
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:33,370
Oh.

832
00:35:33,444 --> 00:35:34,502
You know what I'm
gonna do for you?

833
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:35,977
What you fixing to do?

834
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,911
You ever had a velveteen rub?

835
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:40,348
A velveteen rub.

836
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,817
Ain't... Ain't no cheese involved, is there?

837
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:44,786
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

838
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:53,189
Oh, yeah.

839
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:03,134
Ooh!

840
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:04,765
You're choking my chicken!

841
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,113
Ugh!

842
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:20,521
Ugh.

843
00:36:20,591 --> 00:36:22,559
That's quite a show you got going

844
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,594
under the big top there, Sparky.

845
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:26,129
I had to take another
one of them damn pills

846
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:27,424
in the middle of the night, man.

847
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:29,466
This woman insatiable, man.
I'm shooting dust.

848
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:32,434
Oh, Floyd.

849
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:33,629
I'm right here, baby.

850
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:34,864
You ready for some more?

851
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:35,962
Yeah, come here.

852
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:40,738
Come here.

853
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:41,835
Hi.

854
00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:44,608
Think about that, boy.

855
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:46,741
There's my stallion.

856
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:48,079
Huh?

857
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:49,813
- I missed you.
- Oh, you missed me?

858
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:50,979
Mmm-hmm.

859
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:53,023
Mmm. You need a little air
on this thing.

860
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,183
Yeah.

861
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:57,454
Oh, you bad boy.

862
00:36:57,528 --> 00:36:59,155
God damn.

863
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:00,787
You like that, huh?

864
00:37:00,864 --> 00:37:02,456
I'm your little kitty cat.

865
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:06,836
Chastity?

866
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,066
Mama?

867
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,368
You little whore.

868
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,909
You're one to talk.

869
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:15,376
Oh, did you take out
your teeth for him?

870
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:17,437
You watch how you talk to your mama.

871
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:19,106
Please, you can't
talk to me like that.

872
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:20,241
You're not my daddy.

873
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,341
That's right, who's your daddy?

874
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:22,544
- You're my daddy.
- Your big daddy.

875
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:25,411
Rosalee, are you in there?

876
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:28,014
Actually, that's my daddy.

877
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,286
Oh.

878
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:32,720
What are you thinking, Mama?

879
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:33,820
You ruined everything.

880
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:35,956
- I hate you.
- You little brat.

881
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,126
You're a dirty... all right, I love you.

882
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:39,726
- Mmm.
- Call me a lot of times.

883
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,101
Mama, what is wrong with you?

884
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:44,402
- I renounce you. You're a whore.
- Aah!

885
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:46,238
- I'm a whore?
- Yeah.

886
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,835
You just shamed the whole family,
you and the black man.

887
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:53,546
Whoa!

888
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:55,482
Whoo! That was fun.

889
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:05,386
<i>So come, take me by the hand</i>

890
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:07,396
<i>We'll leave this troubled land</i>

891
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:09,022
<i>- Yeah.
- I know we can</i>

892
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,327
<i>I know we can</i>

893
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:11,595
I'll be damned, man.

894
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,431
Them broads stole our money, man.

895
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,994
Whoo, yeah,

896
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:17,472
but they earned it.

897
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:20,104
Hello.

898
00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:21,644
<i>Yeah, man.
It's Floyd Henderson, man.</i>

899
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:22,872
<i>We got a situation.</i>

900
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,038
What's the problem?

901
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:25,706
Well, my ex-partner,

902
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:27,250
the degenerate that he is, man,

903
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:30,377
got some trailer trash hos,
man, rip us off.

904
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:32,115
<i>Oh, wow, I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

905
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:33,486
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

906
00:38:33,557 --> 00:38:35,548
Yeah, there's something
you can do. We need money.

907
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:36,718
<i>If we don't get no money,</i>

908
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,261
<i>we ain't gonna make it to the Apollo.</i>

909
00:38:38,328 --> 00:38:40,626
I'm not sure what the procedure
for that would be.

910
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:42,824
I mean, there's just
a lot of red tape here.

911
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,333
You know, uh...

912
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:46,426
I'm going to have to get back to you.

913
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:49,097
<i>- You do that. Get back with me now.
- Mr. Henderson...</i>

914
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:52,142
We ain't gonna get very far
on ten gallons of gas,

915
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:54,575
I can tell you that.

916
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:56,408
I know where we can
get some money.

917
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,742
I know how to get some money.

918
00:39:03,654 --> 00:39:08,148
<i>Ain't no love, ain't no love</i>

919
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:13,427
<i>Like my baby's love</i>

920
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:16,694
<i>Ain't no lonely days</i>

921
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,726
<i>Ain't no lonely</i>

922
00:39:19,803 --> 00:39:22,135
Ooh, shit. What the hell is...

923
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:27,610
<i>'Cause I ain't never,
never found me a girl</i>

924
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:30,010
Oh, hell, no. You didn't.

925
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,809
Yes, I did.

926
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:33,873
<i>- To love me like
- I do</i>

927
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,283
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

928
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:37,411
Hey.

929
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,217
Hey, hey, you're...
What is wrong with you?

930
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,018
Don't be grabbing on me like that now.

931
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:43,525
I will knock your ass out
before I let you go ring that doorbell.

932
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:45,027
Come on, get up
on me, man. Come on.

933
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:46,824
You really want this? Huh?

934
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:48,626
- Huh?
- Come on... Oh! God damn.

935
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:49,791
- Oh, man. Come on...
- What?

936
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:51,266
- Oh!
- What's wrong, what?

937
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:52,461
I got a pain in my chest, man.

938
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:54,060
Come on, man.
Stop fucking with me.

939
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,161
Look like I'm fucking with you, man?

940
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,331
Come on, man, do me a favor.

941
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:57,896
Get my heart medicine
out of my bag.

942
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,068
- You got some heart med...
- Oh! Come on, look.

943
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:02,407
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

944
00:40:04,414 --> 00:40:05,676
Hold on, man!

945
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,575
God damn, you got enough stuff in here
to start a drug store!

946
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:11,052
What it say on the bottle?

947
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:13,419
Sucker, motherfucker.

948
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,327
I'm gonna get your ass for this.

949
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:22,558
I'll leave the light on for you.

950
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:27,029
What up, dawg?

951
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:29,902
Um...

952
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:31,998
We're friends of, uh, Odetta's.

953
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:34,566
- Odetta?
- Yeah, is she in?

954
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:36,340
No, she ain't here, man.

955
00:40:36,413 --> 00:40:38,677
Is she coming back?

956
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:39,943
Seriously doubt it.

957
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:43,180
Not unless we fitting to have
a zombie attack or some shit.

958
00:40:43,253 --> 00:40:45,187
Eee!

959
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:46,449
What's up, Fu Manchu?

960
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:48,388
- Cleo!
- Yeah?

961
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,720
Get your ass out here!

962
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:52,125
Two old niggers
looking for your mama.

963
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,888
Come on in, man.
You're letting the heat out.

964
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:58,093
Mama?

965
00:40:58,168 --> 00:40:59,226
Cold outside.

966
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:00,964
Your arthritis gonna kick up.

967
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:06,271
Who's that?

968
00:41:06,343 --> 00:41:07,833
I don't know.

969
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:14,075
Yeah?

970
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:15,778
Uh, how you doing, ma'am?

971
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:17,217
My name is Floyd Henderson.
This is my...

972
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:19,152
I know who you are.

973
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:20,883
Guess you didn't hear
about the funeral.

974
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,722
Funeral? Odetta...

975
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:24,886
When did she pass?

976
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:27,089
Well, she got sick right after Christmas.

977
00:41:27,164 --> 00:41:30,099
After that, it went pretty fast.

978
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,260
So why'd you come to see her?

979
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:33,496
What, she owe you
money or something?

980
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,800
- Oh, no.
- We just in the neighborhood.

981
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:38,340
Cleo, I can't find the bologna!

982
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:40,171
I'll be there in a minute!

983
00:41:40,243 --> 00:41:41,972
Hurry up!

984
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:46,505
Well, if my mama wasn't dead,
I'd tell her you stopped by.

985
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,845
Cleo!

986
00:41:47,918 --> 00:41:50,944
- Just hold on a second.
- C-L-E-O!

987
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:52,045
- What the hell you want?
- I'm sorry...

988
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:53,384
I told you this was
a bad idea to come here.

989
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:54,754
Come on, man. Don't go there.

990
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:55,849
Let's just go, okay?

991
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:56,950
How old you think she is?

992
00:41:57,027 --> 00:41:58,426
27, 28?

993
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:00,326
I don't know how old she is,
and I don't care. Let's go.

994
00:42:00,397 --> 00:42:01,557
Chillax, let me see something.

995
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:02,997
What are you doing?

996
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:05,261
Floyd, what the hell
are you looking for?

997
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:06,461
Damn it.

998
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:07,833
I'm just confirming a suspicion.

999
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:09,462
That's all I'm doing.

1000
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:12,667
September 14, 1981. Bingo.

1001
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:14,973
It kind of works itself out, don't it?

1002
00:42:15,045 --> 00:42:16,239
Put it back.

1003
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:19,108
Listen.

1004
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:20,581
Odetta left me, man,

1005
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:23,279
Thanksgiving Day, man, 1980.

1006
00:42:23,353 --> 00:42:25,344
- So?
- So you do the math, motherfucker.

1007
00:42:25,422 --> 00:42:27,982
Do the math? Nigga, please...

1008
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:29,491
<i>Oh, shit. You hear that?</i>

1009
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,753
Hear what?

1010
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:33,489
Listen, that bass line, right there.

1011
00:42:33,563 --> 00:42:35,724
Hmm?

1012
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:37,528
Son of a bitch.

1013
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:40,965
Oh, my name is Lester,
the Court Jester

1014
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:43,006
All you other rap niggas
done messed up

1015
00:42:43,073 --> 00:42:44,563
I take you to school a semester

1016
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:46,131
Take you to court and sequester

1017
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,143
- Yeah!
- I'm judge and the jury

1018
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:49,906
<i>Bruce Lee, Fists of Fury.</i>

1019
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,175
You want to whip me,
the L-E-S-T-E-R

1020
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:54,882
Grab my girl by the waist

1021
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:56,248
Slap my girl in the face

1022
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,514
When my mama died,
I moved inside her crib

1023
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:01,386
Hey, hey. Les, Les.

1024
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,358
Hey, man, what you doing in here?

1025
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:05,588
We're here trying to make some music.

1026
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:08,153
That what y'all doing?

1027
00:43:08,231 --> 00:43:09,425
I don't see no musicians.

1028
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:11,865
Listen, you know who played the base line

1029
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:14,597
on that stuff you got running
under those so-called lyrics?

1030
00:43:14,671 --> 00:43:17,299
My man, right there.

1031
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:20,072
Yeah, right, man.

1032
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:23,670
He ain't no damn instrumentator.

1033
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:25,374
Hey, yo, Big L, check it out, man.
It's them, man.

1034
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:26,643
They ain't bullshitting.

1035
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:27,979
Let me see this here.

1036
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:30,349
The Real Deal, huh?

1037
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,116
Hey, I mean, so what if we
jacked your shit, man? Huh?

1038
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,624
Good artists borrow,

1039
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:37,523
great artists steal, man.

1040
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:40,062
- You know who said that?
- Pablo Picasso.

1041
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,258
But literary scholars sometimes
like to attribute it to T.S. Eliot.

1042
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:46,734
Hell, no. It wasn't no damn
Missy Elliot, man.

1043
00:43:46,803 --> 00:43:49,033
No, man, it was Bay Bay and them.

1044
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:50,232
Bay Bay, yup.

1045
00:43:50,307 --> 00:43:52,605
That was Bay Bay,
for sure, hey, Bay Bay.

1046
00:43:52,676 --> 00:43:53,700
Look, man.

1047
00:43:53,777 --> 00:43:55,438
You know what? I'm sorry.

1048
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:57,571
I shouldn't have sampled
your music without permission.

1049
00:43:57,647 --> 00:43:59,911
Why don't we all do a song together?

1050
00:43:59,983 --> 00:44:02,451
A song called "Fuck You
and Your Bass Line. "

1051
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:04,282
That's what I feel about it.

1052
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:06,288
Here what I think
about your damn bassline.

1053
00:44:06,356 --> 00:44:08,950
Henderson and Hinds!

1054
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:10,049
Take that shit with you.

1055
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:11,719
Gold-faced motherfucker.

1056
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:12,921
I made that shit gangster,
that's what I did.

1057
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:14,395
Let me tell you something,
man, you...

1058
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:16,591
Hey! Stop it!

1059
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:20,464
Stop it!

1060
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:22,232
Hey! This is my house.
You hear me?

1061
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:23,670
I don't need this shit right now.

1062
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,799
You gonna talk to me crazy
in front of my boys?

1063
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,106
Why you still talking?
Shut the fuck up!

1064
00:44:28,178 --> 00:44:30,578
Pay-Pay and Zig-Zig,

1065
00:44:30,647 --> 00:44:32,672
let's dip, man.

1066
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:36,549
Bye, old niggers.

1067
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:40,112
Feel free to utilize
my facilities while you're here

1068
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,487
to make yourself another hit.

1069
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:44,994
I know you ain't had a hit
since Ike hit Tina.

1070
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,028
Get out of here.

1071
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:49,156
Get the fuck

1072
00:44:49,232 --> 00:44:51,496
Out my grill

1073
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:53,968
'Fore you get killed

1074
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:56,733
My name is Lester the Court Jester.

1075
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:59,674
What a disrespectful son of a bitch.

1076
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:02,143
- Just lay off.
- Just lay off?

1077
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:03,839
I know your mama taught you better.

1078
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:05,381
Odetta would've
whooped his damn ass.

1079
00:45:05,448 --> 00:45:07,780
The fuck you know about
what my mama would've done.

1080
00:45:07,851 --> 00:45:10,183
Were you here when she was
dying of that cancer?

1081
00:45:10,253 --> 00:45:12,687
I don't think so. I think Lester was.
The hell you know.

1082
00:45:12,756 --> 00:45:14,018
You're right. I don't know nothing.

1083
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,489
That's right, he don't know shit.

1084
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,322
No, he don't.

1085
00:45:17,394 --> 00:45:20,192
Now I'm going to go change
and get dinner started

1086
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:21,855
because you guys
are staying, right?

1087
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:23,058
Oh, no. We need to hit the road.

1088
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,192
Yes, ma'am. We are staying.

1089
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,532
Okay, then.

1090
00:45:29,873 --> 00:45:32,171
Hell, it's what Mama would've wanted.

1091
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:35,336
Oh, yeah. That's Odetta's
child, all right.

1092
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:46,185
Okay, I put some sheets on the bed
in the guest room for you guys.

1093
00:45:46,256 --> 00:45:48,486
Thank you.

1094
00:45:48,558 --> 00:45:50,685
That's Carla Thomas, right?

1095
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,354
Sure is. Your mother's favorite.

1096
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:58,125
So how come you guys only
put out that one album?

1097
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:02,070
Well, when we wasn't
fighting over your mother,

1098
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:03,400
we had a problem
in our record sales.

1099
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:05,441
Yeah, as in we didn't sell any.

1100
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:06,668
Okay.

1101
00:46:08,411 --> 00:46:11,608
Well, you'd never know it wasn't a hit,

1102
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:13,706
as much as Mama played it.

1103
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:21,621
About 100 degrees, and you
got a leather jacket on.

1104
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:22,953
Appreciate it, Sam.

1105
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:26,688
She said,

1106
00:46:26,763 --> 00:46:28,424
being on the road with y'all

1107
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:31,763
was some of the best times of her life.

1108
00:46:31,835 --> 00:46:35,464
Oh, good days. Good days.

1109
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:38,132
I wish I could've seen that.

1110
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:42,440
Say, why don't you
come to Memphis with us?

1111
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:44,639
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

1112
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,648
- What?
- We got a gig.

1113
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:47,808
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Floyd, Floyd.

1114
00:46:47,884 --> 00:46:48,976
The girl got a life.

1115
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:50,144
She ain't got time to be ripping,

1116
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,653
running up and down the road
with two old niggers.

1117
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:53,188
Why not?

1118
00:46:53,256 --> 00:46:55,816
Memphis is fun.
We always have fun in Memphis.

1119
00:46:55,892 --> 00:46:56,984
You'll enjoy it. Trust me.

1120
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,689
Fun? Look like I got time for fun?

1121
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:03,025
Nah.

1122
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:12,775
Hey, Louis.

1123
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:15,902
You know, Cleo was telling me

1124
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:18,004
that Odetta never told her nothing
about her father,

1125
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:20,345
not even his name.

1126
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:22,180
But she did say
he was a musician.

1127
00:47:22,252 --> 00:47:23,776
You ain't said nothing stupid
to the girl, have you?

1128
00:47:23,853 --> 00:47:24,945
Like what?

1129
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,819
Oh, like, uh,

1130
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:29,119
Cleo, you know, I'm your daddy.

1131
00:47:29,192 --> 00:47:31,854
Well, I'm still
feeling out the situation.

1132
00:47:31,928 --> 00:47:33,190
What the fuck was that

1133
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:34,890
that "You ought to come
to Memphis with us" shit?

1134
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:38,298
Now that, right there,
that's a recipe for disaster.

1135
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:41,633
Louis, Louis, I know
this ain't easy for you.

1136
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:44,173
But I never thought I'd have a child.

1137
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,037
Now I'm part of this big
old circle called life.

1138
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:51,103
A piece of Floyd Henderson,
man, might be here to live on,

1139
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:52,614
and maybe forever.

1140
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:54,547
If you don't shut up
and go to sleep,

1141
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:57,984
a big piece of Floyd Henderson ass
might not wake up in the morning.

1142
00:47:58,054 --> 00:47:59,817
Oh, Louis, Louis.

1143
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:01,447
I respect the fact that you want

1144
00:48:01,524 --> 00:48:03,924
to cloak your pain with your anger.

1145
00:48:09,032 --> 00:48:12,825
Good night.

1146
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:21,643
Oh, hey! What the fuck is that?

1147
00:48:21,711 --> 00:48:22,769
What's wrong?

1148
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:24,438
You been taking
them dick pills again?

1149
00:48:24,514 --> 00:48:26,880
I though it was my cholesterol meds,
I swear I did.

1150
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,214
You can't be spooning
with a motherfucker with that!

1151
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:30,445
What's wrong with you?

1152
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,045
- Uh, I...
- Nasty son of a bitch!

1153
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:34,613
Give me some covers.
I'm gonna sleep on the floor.

1154
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:35,749
Shit.

1155
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,349
Go on, then. Sleep on the floor.

1156
00:48:37,427 --> 00:48:38,485
Nobody wants you, Louis.

1157
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:40,461
I don't like boy pussy no way.

1158
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,997
I hope your back hurt
like a motherfucker.

1159
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:44,499
Better my back than my asshole.

1160
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,660
Nasty... I'll beat
your motherfucking...

1161
00:48:46,736 --> 00:48:48,636
All them years I spent in prison,

1162
00:48:48,705 --> 00:48:50,639
ain't nobody roll up on me like that.

1163
00:48:50,707 --> 00:48:52,299
I was going to ask you about that.

1164
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,673
You ought to be ashamed
of your goddamn self,

1165
00:48:54,744 --> 00:48:56,177
nasty son of a bitch.

1166
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,922
Like I never had

1167
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:26,675
When I'm feeling bad

1168
00:49:26,743 --> 00:49:30,372
Come on and comfort me

1169
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:34,178
Oh, baby, you know the way

1170
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,014
I showed you how to love me right

1171
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:42,787
So comfort me tonight

1172
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:47,262
Come on and comfort me, honey

1173
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:54,637
You know the way, baby

1174
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:57,696
'Cause I showed you right

1175
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:04,510
I want it, I want it

1176
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:07,846
Why don't you

1177
00:50:10,453 --> 00:50:13,980
Comfort me?

1178
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:30,703
Floyd!

1179
00:50:37,313 --> 00:50:38,473
Yo.

1180
00:50:38,548 --> 00:50:39,810
<i>Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson?</i>

1181
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:41,043
No, this is Louis.

1182
00:50:41,117 --> 00:50:42,778
Mr. Hinds.

1183
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:44,581
It's Phillip Newman
of FC Management.

1184
00:50:44,654 --> 00:50:46,315
How are you, man? I'm a huge fan.

1185
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:47,822
So?

1186
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:50,086
So...

1187
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,187
I think I've solved your
cash flow problems, my man.

1188
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:56,732
I've withdrawn $10,000

1189
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:58,289
from my old parents' savings account

1190
00:50:58,368 --> 00:51:00,529
to tide you over until
things get sorted out.

1191
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:01,831
Who'd you say you was again?

1192
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:02,997
<i>Phillip.</i>

1193
00:51:03,072 --> 00:51:04,596
I wrote you letters
when the man had you

1194
00:51:04,674 --> 00:51:06,471
locked down in the pen, you know?

1195
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:08,909
I know you're innocent.
Shit ain't right.

1196
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:12,882
Okay, Phillip, um, look here.

1197
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:13,973
We're on our way to Memphis.

1198
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,109
Um, why don't you meet us

1199
00:51:16,186 --> 00:51:19,417
at, um, the fountain at Peabody Hotel,

1200
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:21,787
<i>5:00?</i>

1201
00:51:21,858 --> 00:51:24,725
Memphis. All right!

1202
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,453
I'm hungrier than a mo...

1203
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,964
There you are, girl.
You make up your mind?

1204
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:31,523
You want to go to Memphis
with us, or not?

1205
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:33,159
What you gonna do?

1206
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:37,430
What happened?

1207
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:40,773
Nothing. Nothing happened.

1208
00:51:42,111 --> 00:51:44,011
Nothing happened.

1209
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,346
- No.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1210
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:48,907
Let him get his whupping.

1211
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:01,419
Why you hit her?

1212
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:04,898
The hell you gonna
do about it, man?

1213
00:52:04,968 --> 00:52:06,765
I'm the nigger with the gun, man.

1214
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:07,928
Oh, shit.

1215
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:10,768
Damn! Ugh!

1216
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,932
- Aah!
- Come on.

1217
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:15,739
Get your albino
Ike Turner ass up, uh-huh.

1218
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:17,074
Come on.

1219
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:20,240
Aah! Okay! Oh, shit! Aah!

1220
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:21,840
My follicles, man!

1221
00:52:21,918 --> 00:52:24,887
Look her in the eye and say
"I'm sorry I hit you,

1222
00:52:24,954 --> 00:52:26,444
and I'm never gonna put
my hands on you again. "

1223
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:29,150
- My bad, baby. I ain't...
- Say what I told you to say!

1224
00:52:29,225 --> 00:52:31,557
I'm sorry I hit you.
I ain't never gonna do it again.

1225
00:52:31,628 --> 00:52:34,188
Now, say you're sorry
for sampling my bass line

1226
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:36,459
and for stomping
on my partner's record.

1227
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:39,126
I'm sorry for sampling your bass line

1228
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:41,864
- and stomping on your Real Deal record.
- Okay.

1229
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:43,769
Now, we taking a road trip,
and we need some gas money.

1230
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,603
I ain't got no money, man!

1231
00:52:45,675 --> 00:52:48,109
Can you help us?
I saw you out there selling that shit.

1232
00:52:48,177 --> 00:52:49,804
It's weed, it ain't crack man!
I ain't got...

1233
00:52:49,879 --> 00:52:51,710
- Give me the money!
- Okay, okay.

1234
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:53,043
There's money in my shorts...

1235
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:54,606
Ain't nobody reaching
in your drawers, get it out!

1236
00:52:54,684 --> 00:52:56,311
Okay, okay.

1237
00:52:56,386 --> 00:52:59,753
I got to reach around my meat, man.

1238
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:03,058
- Here.
- Take it.

1239
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:04,821
Take it.

1240
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:08,023
Oh, damn. My hair hurts.

1241
00:53:08,097 --> 00:53:09,689
Take it, man! Aah!

1242
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:10,698
Ow! You're breaking my arm!

1243
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:12,064
Oh, hush.

1244
00:53:12,135 --> 00:53:14,160
That's just a little
Chinese submission hold.

1245
00:53:14,237 --> 00:53:16,535
This is what it feels like
when I break your arm.

1246
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,840
- Shit!
- Break his arm.

1247
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:22,400
Oh, bastard!

1248
00:53:22,478 --> 00:53:24,571
I know motherfuckers like you, Lester.

1249
00:53:24,647 --> 00:53:26,877
Used to see them
in the yard every day.

1250
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:30,112
You'd better hope
you don't never go inside

1251
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:33,644
because you,
you straight up bitch material.

1252
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:35,122
What about my car, man?

1253
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:36,317
What about your car?

1254
00:53:36,392 --> 00:53:38,360
Oh, shit.

1255
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:39,554
I ain't got no clothes on.

1256
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:40,994
This is bullshit.

1257
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:42,793
So what? You run around
with your drawers

1258
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:44,230
hanging off your ass anyway.

1259
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,427
I wasn't really gonna shoot you!

1260
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:47,594
Get the fuck out of here.

1261
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,661
See, I'm the nigger
with the gun now.

1262
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:51,730
You better hope my arm
don't get better.

1263
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:54,003
I'm gonna learn karate
and kick your ass!

1264
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:55,544
Fuck you!

1265
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,413
It was a good thing you stepped in

1266
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:01,040
when you did what you did, partner,

1267
00:54:01,117 --> 00:54:02,550
because if I'd have
got a piece of him,

1268
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:05,314
I'd have fucked his shit up
entirely, and you know that.

1269
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:06,650
Come on.

1270
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:08,520
I'm too old to be tussling
with the motherf...

1271
00:54:08,591 --> 00:54:10,616
I'd have shot him. I'd have popped...

1272
00:54:10,693 --> 00:54:13,218
I'm six, seven years older.
I'd have, like, tussled...

1273
00:54:16,332 --> 00:54:17,594

Our show's up in there.

1290
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:59,439
<i>How long must I wait for you?</i>

1291
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:02,603
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1292
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,339
<i>Ooh, wee</i>

1293
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,541
<i>The Memphis train</i>

1294
00:55:06,616 --> 00:55:08,948
<i>Let me try it one more time</i>

1295
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:11,851
<i>Say, ooh, ooh, ooh, wee</i>

1296
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:14,412
Oh, my God.

1297
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,253
Mr. Henderson, Mr. Hinds,

1298
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:17,553
let me just start off by saying...

1299
00:55:17,627 --> 00:55:18,924
Thank you.

1300
00:55:22,965 --> 00:55:24,227
What's up?

1301
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,030
Phillip, tonight we're
playing at the House of Soul.

1302
00:55:27,103 --> 00:55:28,434
Make sure you be there, baby.

1303
00:55:28,504 --> 00:55:31,439
Right on.

1304
00:55:31,507 --> 00:55:34,203
Hello. Welcome to the Peabody.
How can I help you?

1305
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:36,711
You can help me by giving me

1306
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:38,440
three of your best
doggone suites, baby.

1307
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:41,449
Well, it'll be my pleasure
to assist you today.

1308
00:55:41,517 --> 00:55:42,643
May I see some identification, please?

1309
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:43,878
Okay.

1310
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:45,386
Right there.

1311
00:55:45,455 --> 00:55:46,945
Go to hell, Louis.

1312
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:49,992
Mr. Henderson?

1313
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:51,526
It is I.

1314
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,893
Will you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

1315
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:01,129
Okay.

1316
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:04,565
Henderson.

1317
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,803
Ahh, I-I'm sorry,
Mr. Henderson, Henderson.

1318
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:09,674
We're unable to accommodate you.

1319
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,770
Perhaps we could
recommend another hotel.

1320
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:13,440
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

1321
00:56:13,516 --> 00:56:14,847
I want to stay at the Peabody.

1322
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:17,477
Yes, sir, I understand
you've stayed with us before,

1323
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:18,952
and apparently,
that's the problem.

1324
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:21,285
It seems that the last time
you stayed here...

1325
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:24,520
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

1326
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:27,563
you hosted a party,
during which the room

1327
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,495
and several other areas of the hotel

1328
00:56:29,565 --> 00:56:31,897
- sustained extensive damage.
- Uh-oh.

1329
00:56:31,968 --> 00:56:34,129
I don't recollect nothing like that.

1330
00:56:34,203 --> 00:56:36,068
I think that's the night
Sly and Bootsy

1331
00:56:36,138 --> 00:56:37,696
came by with the fire-eater.

1332
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:40,105
Is that the one with the snake?

1333
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:42,110
- That's the one.
- Hmm.

1334
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:45,841
Perhaps you could put those rooms
in the name of Louis Hinds.

1335
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,177
Yeah, perhaps.

1336
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,275
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

1337
00:56:56,759 --> 00:56:58,693
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

1338
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:00,490
What's on there?
Let me see that shit.

1339
00:57:00,563 --> 00:57:02,690
I want to see what's on there.

1340
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:05,563
I need four rooms, Don.

1341
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,569
Your best available.

1342
00:57:23,653 --> 00:57:25,143
Oh, hey, guys.

1343
00:57:25,221 --> 00:57:27,314
Your tailor gave me
several choices for tonight.

1344
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:29,358
He said he's going
to stop by around 7:30.

1345
00:57:29,425 --> 00:57:30,483
What the fuck?

1346
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,255
Did you catch the sale
over at the Build-A-Pimp?

1347
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:34,489
You like that? It's fly, huh?

1348
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:37,192
It's a get-down, get-down.
It's live. It's funky.

1349
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:38,858
And I think I'm going
to get some poonanny.

1350
00:57:38,935 --> 00:57:40,425
To be honest with you,

1351
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:42,869
<i>I haven't been laid
since Friends was on television.</i>

1352
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:44,201
So this is my night.

1353
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:46,833
You sure that ain't
one of your children?

1354
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:50,874
You gonna sing real nice tonight.

1355
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:52,107
Who's the girl singer?

1356
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:59,043
Oh, my goodness!
Look at here! Oh, man.

1357
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:00,247
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

1358
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:01,415
You good, man?

1359
00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:09,690
Hey, good-looking.

1360
00:58:09,765 --> 00:58:12,256
Claudette.
How you doing, girl?

1361
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:13,893
I know you still ain't upset

1362
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,267
about what happened
in Baltimore that...

1363
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:17,363
Oh! What's wrong
with you, woman?

1364
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,840
You going straight to hell, Floyd Henderson.

1365
00:58:21,377 --> 00:58:22,639
What you laughing at?

1366
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:25,579
- You want some, too?
- No.

1367
00:58:25,648 --> 00:58:26,615
Fuck you.

1368
00:58:26,682 --> 00:58:28,240
Eee.

1369
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:29,978
Fuck you, fuck you

1370
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:31,713
Now we have no girl singer.

1371
00:58:31,787 --> 00:58:33,721
We just got to find
a replacement, that's all.

1372
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:34,949
It's too late.

1373
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:37,254
Cleo.

1374
00:58:37,326 --> 00:58:39,123
You know all our songs, right?

1375
00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:42,096
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

1376
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:43,825
but I'm not playing
with no rank amateur.

1377
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:46,231
Come on, Wolfman,
this ain't no rank amateur, man.

1378
00:58:46,302 --> 00:58:47,963
This Odetta Whitfield's daughter, man.

1379
00:58:48,037 --> 00:58:49,163
Ain't got to recognize.

1380
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:51,729
Shit. Let's roll, then, baby.

1381
00:58:51,807 --> 00:58:53,399
Yeah.

1382
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:56,274
She can sing, can't she?

1383
00:58:58,047 --> 00:58:59,036
Ow!

1384
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,715
Ow!

1385
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,387
Oh, oh!

1386
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:10,515
Here we go.

1387
00:59:10,593 --> 00:59:13,289
Oh, yeah.

1388
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:20,000
If music makes you move

1389
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:22,435
You can really groove

1390
00:59:22,505 --> 00:59:28,974
Groove on

1391
00:59:29,045 --> 00:59:32,276
If you feel like
you want to make love

1392
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:35,078
Under the stars above

1393
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:37,085
Love on

1394
00:59:38,988 --> 00:59:40,649
Love on

1395
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,657
If there's something
that you wanna say

1396
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:47,753
And talking is the hard way

1397
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:54,695
Rap on

1398
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,001
'Cause whatever

1399
00:59:58,074 --> 00:59:59,769
You want to do

1400
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:03,278
- Ow
- You got to do your thing

1401
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:10,243
If you feel like
you want to scream

1402
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:13,421
If that's your way you let off steam

1403
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:14,979
Scream on

1404
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:19,093
Scream on

1405
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,354
If you feel like you want to sing

1406
01:00:23,432 --> 01:00:26,265
'Cause singing is your thing

1407
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:28,303
Sing on

1408
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:33,300
Sing on

1409
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:36,003
If you want to make love all night

1410
01:00:36,078 --> 01:00:39,775
'Cause you feel it's right

1411
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:41,680
- Right on
- Oh, yeah, girl.

1412
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:44,879
Right on

1413
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:48,890
'Cause whatever

1414
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:51,893
You want to do

1415
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:53,952
You got to do your thing

1416
01:01:04,306 --> 01:01:06,467
I'm with the band.
Yeah, it's a dream.

1417
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,533
Yeah, it's a... it's a total dream.

1418
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:09,703
Yeah.

1419
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:12,145
I play the harmuffica.

1420
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:16,310
Wa, wa

1421
01:01:16,385 --> 01:01:17,647
I'll save you a seat.

1422
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,951
'Cause whatever

1423
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:24,220
You want to do

1424
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:28,662
Yeah, baby, oh

1425
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:34,396
You got to do your thing

1426
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,665
Yeah

1427
01:01:42,878 --> 01:01:45,676
Yeah.

1428
01:01:53,756 --> 01:01:57,283
This is the most insane
night of my life.

1429
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,156
You know Isaac wants
to put me in his studio?

1430
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:02,561
He says he's got a song
that'd be perfect for me.

1431
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:04,599
Oh, he does, does he?

1432
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:07,966
Uh... Come on, now. It ain't like that.

1433
01:02:08,037 --> 01:02:09,800
Oh, it's always like that,

1434
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:11,362
like movies.

1435
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,309
Well, I'll be careful.

1436
01:02:15,377 --> 01:02:18,107
Just trying to look out
for you, that's all.

1437
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:23,312
Thanks, guys, for everything.

1438
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:29,488
You got to do your thing, hey

1439
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:32,026
See you later.

1440
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:40,424
If you feel like making love

1441
01:02:40,502 --> 01:02:42,993
'Cause that's your thing

1442
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:45,768
Right on

1443
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:48,241
Man, ain't that the Real Deal car?

1444
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,437
Sure is, homie. You a fan?

1445
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:56,049
Hell, yeah. I'm a big fan.

1446
01:02:56,118 --> 01:02:57,642
You know where they at?

1447
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,153
'Cause I need to holler at 'em.

1448
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:02,657
Actually, I'm their manager.

1449
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:05,990
Really? Their manager?

1450
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,565
Hold on a minute.

1451
01:03:15,938 --> 01:03:17,963
- Oh, hi, Floyd.
- Hey.

1452
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,099
Come on in.
Check this place out.

1453
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:21,403
I could get used to this.

1454
01:03:21,477 --> 01:03:22,842
I'll bet you could.

1455
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:24,072
Let me get you a drink.

1456
01:03:24,146 --> 01:03:25,272
Yeah, I'll take one.

1457
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:26,609
But hold on, before you do that,

1458
01:03:26,682 --> 01:03:28,274
there's something
I want to say to you.

1459
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,250
It's been a blast connecting with you.

1460
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,581
I want you to know that.

1461
01:03:31,654 --> 01:03:33,087
That's sweet of you.

1462
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:34,417
And if you need anything,

1463
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:35,684
like money or something like that,

1464
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:38,522
don't you hesitate to call me now.

1465
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:40,653
Not that money gonna make up
for the lost time between us

1466
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:42,196
or nothing like that.

1467
01:03:42,264 --> 01:03:43,526
Lost time?

1468
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:44,623
You have to understand,

1469
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,794
Odetta never told me
nothing about you.

1470
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,633
Had I known about you
from the beginning,

1471
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:50,967
- I'd have been here from the start.
- Whoa, whoa.

1472
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,302
- Floyd...
- She never said nothing to me about you.

1473
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:53,636
You're not my father, Floyd.

1474
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:55,142
You're not listening.

1475
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,802
See, the thing you...
what's that? Say what?

1476
01:03:56,879 --> 01:03:58,437
You're not my father.

1477
01:03:58,514 --> 01:04:00,243
I- I'm not?

1478
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:01,613
No.

1479
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:03,276
How do you know?

1480
01:04:03,352 --> 01:04:05,650
Because he knows who I am

1481
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,211
Or he did.

1482
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:08,551
I mean, for all I know,

1483
01:04:08,624 --> 01:04:09,852
he could be dead.

1484
01:04:11,293 --> 01:04:14,262
I get a little money from him
every once in a while.

1485
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:17,060
It's a blind trust he set up years ago.

1486
01:04:17,132 --> 01:04:19,259
Something to do
with his music royalties.

1487
01:04:19,335 --> 01:04:22,065
Music royalties?

1488
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,837
Oh!

1489
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:28,809
You knocked up my wife, motherfucker.

1490
01:04:28,877 --> 01:04:32,005
Ooh. You stole her from me first.

1491
01:04:32,081 --> 01:04:33,946
What is wrong with you?

1492
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:35,540
Whoo!

1493
01:04:35,617 --> 01:04:36,948
You lost your...

1494
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:38,452
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

1495
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,953
No, I didn't tell her.

1496
01:04:40,022 --> 01:04:41,353
I should've told her, though.

1497
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:43,687
I'll bet you laughing
your ass off, wasn't you?

1498
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,226
Going around, talking
about I'm the girl's daddy

1499
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:48,127
and big round circle of life,
all that bullshit.

1500
01:04:48,197 --> 01:04:49,630
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

1501
01:04:49,698 --> 01:04:51,359
Well, just a little bit.

1502
01:04:53,302 --> 01:04:54,633
Floyd...

1503
01:04:54,703 --> 01:04:56,466
Look, Floyd...

1504
01:04:56,538 --> 01:04:57,732
Floyd, put it down. Put it down!

1505
01:04:57,806 --> 01:05:00,400
Dawg, come on!

1506
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:02,068
You need to quit before you get hurt.

1507
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:05,136
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

1508
01:05:05,214 --> 01:05:06,238
Ugh!

1509
01:05:06,315 --> 01:05:07,748
Look, Floyd,

1510
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:09,750
I didn't mean for it
to happen, all right?

1511
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:11,115
You know how she was.

1512
01:05:11,186 --> 01:05:14,516
Come here.

1513
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,148
Come on, man. Stop acting a fool.

1514
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:18,617
You all right?

1515
01:05:18,694 --> 01:05:20,628
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

1516
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:27,026
Fucking dad!

1517
01:05:27,102 --> 01:05:29,662
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1518
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:54,057
Time out.

1519
01:05:54,129 --> 01:05:56,723
Oh.

1520
01:05:57,933 --> 01:06:00,265
Still got a little pop
in your punch there, partner.

1521
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:02,462
Pop this, motherfucker!

1522
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:04,301
Oh!

1523
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:05,704
Ooh.

1524
01:06:05,774 --> 01:06:07,708
Shit. Ugh.

1525
01:06:07,776 --> 01:06:09,038
You dirty motherfucker,

1526
01:06:09,111 --> 01:06:11,011
hitting me in the nuts.

1527
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,378
Ooh! Shit.

1528
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:17,317
Louis, you just can't
keep whooping on my ass.

1529
01:06:17,386 --> 01:06:19,479
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

1530
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,079
I'm a motherfucking man.

1531
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:27,287
Louis, how come you won't
see your own daughter?

1532
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:29,353
Oh, motherfucker,
I wanted to see her,

1533
01:06:29,431 --> 01:06:31,922
but, you know...

1534
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,901
It's time... After a while,

1535
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:37,996
you know, it's just...
it's just too much.

1536
01:06:38,073 --> 01:06:39,836
Why didn't O tell her?

1537
01:06:39,908 --> 01:06:41,500
Why didn't Odetta tell her, man?

1538
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:43,511
What was she going to tell her, huh?

1539
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:47,276
That her daddy was
a alcoholic dopehead convict

1540
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:49,681
that fucked up everything
he touched, hmm?

1541
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:50,843
No, no.

1542
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:52,750
She was better off without me.

1543
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:54,288
Oh, shit.

1544
01:06:54,356 --> 01:06:55,414
Anyhow, it's too late now.

1545
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:56,515
Uh-uh.

1546
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:59,083
It was a mistake
getting to know her.

1547
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:00,822
- Lou...
- What?

1548
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:02,261
What is wrong with you?
You having a seizure?

1549
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:04,629
What? What?

1550
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,463
Oh.

1551
01:07:06,535 --> 01:07:08,469
Oh. Cleo.

1552
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:10,334
- Cleo, wait. Ow!
- Excuse me.

1553
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,373
God damn it. Wait!

1554
01:07:12,441 --> 01:07:13,931
Let me talk to... ow!

1555
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:15,306
Move, God damn it!

1556
01:07:15,377 --> 01:07:17,004
Come here, Cleo!

1557
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:18,944
Call the police.

1558
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,277
Hey, yo, white boy.

1559
01:07:22,351 --> 01:07:24,376
You really
in the music business?

1560
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:25,545
Why, do you have a mix tape?

1561
01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:27,111
Shut the fuck up, white boy!

1562
01:07:27,189 --> 01:07:29,521
And stop sweating
so goddamn much.

1563
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,115
You smell like bacon.

1564
01:07:31,193 --> 01:07:33,127
And I'm a Muslim on Saturdays.

1565
01:07:33,195 --> 01:07:35,186
Fucking wrong with you, huh?

1566
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,391
How you white and got a afro?

1567
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:39,491
That ain't cool.

1568
01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:40,830
Damn, my head hurt!

1569
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:43,235
Hey, there go Cleo.
There go Cleo.

1570
01:07:43,305 --> 01:07:45,102
Taxi.

1571
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:46,698
There go my baby, right there.

1572
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:48,208
Where she going?

1573
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:49,539
Where to, honey?

1574
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:50,908
Cleo!

1575
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:52,241
Oh, hell, yeah.

1576
01:07:52,314 --> 01:07:55,750
There go that old
Snoop Dogg-looking motherfucker.

1577
01:07:55,817 --> 01:07:56,875
Real Deal,

1578
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:59,420
they fitting to be real dead!

1579
01:07:59,488 --> 01:08:01,115
I'm coming for you, old man!

1580
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:03,283
Hey, yo, Les, let them old
motherfuckers have it, man.

1581
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:04,689
- I'm going for it.
- Go for it, nigger.

1582
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,819
Get them motherfuckers.

1583
01:08:06,895 --> 01:08:08,590
Hey, hey, hey.

1584
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:10,825
Come on, now. You know
I'm the only who drive the Mothership, man.

1585
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:12,366
Watch this shit with Lester

1586
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:13,696
about to kill
on these motherfuckers.

1587
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:15,361
That's how we live,
we do it like that.

1588
01:08:17,272 --> 01:08:18,637
Louis!

1589
01:08:18,707 --> 01:08:20,732
I'm back!

1590
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:23,004
Gun!

1591
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:24,170
Yeah!

1592
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:30,912
Oh, shit! Motherfucking
Lester got fucked up!

1593
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:32,044
God damn!

1594
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:35,656
I'm out of this motherfucker...

1595
01:08:35,724 --> 01:08:36,986
- What about Lester, man?
- Fuck Lester.

1596
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:39,755
Yeah, fuck Lester!

1597
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:43,389
You don't even know Lester, man.

1598
01:08:46,268 --> 01:08:47,860
Why you run over me, man!

1599
01:08:47,936 --> 01:08:51,929
You old dirty bastard!

1600
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:56,275
Old Jim Brown, Fred Williamson,

1601
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:59,007
two-the-hard-way motherfuckers!

1602
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:01,208
I'll kill you, I swear...

1603
01:09:01,283 --> 01:09:03,808
Aah! Shit!

1604
01:09:03,885 --> 01:09:07,377
Let me kill you one time at least, man!

1605
01:09:07,456 --> 01:09:08,821
You done fucked up the Mothership.

1606
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,016
I ought to stab you in your throat.

1607
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:11,218
Fuck you! Aah!

1608
01:09:11,293 --> 01:09:13,056
You hear that?

1609
01:09:13,128 --> 01:09:15,494
Shoot that motherfucker, Louis.

1610
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:19,862
Get your hands up!

1611
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:22,733
I can't, nigger. My arm's in a brace.

1612
01:09:22,804 --> 01:09:25,568
Drop the weapon now!
Come on!

1613
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:32,976
This is my first time ever being in here.

1614
01:09:33,048 --> 01:09:34,447
Quiet, please.

1615
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:42,118
This filthy-ass motherfucking place,

1616
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:43,748
man, got me itching.

1617
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,392
Yo, turnkey!

1618
01:09:47,462 --> 01:09:49,157
Come on and let me out
of this motherfucker!

1619
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:51,495
You might want to wrap
your mind around the fact

1620
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:52,692
that we're gonna miss that show.

1621
01:09:52,768 --> 01:09:54,497
Fuck you talking about, man?

1622
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:57,197
We gotta be in New York
tomorrow night.

1623
01:09:57,272 --> 01:09:59,035
Uh-uh. Not me.

1624
01:09:59,107 --> 01:10:00,335
I've had enough. I'm done.

1625
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:02,434
What, you're walking
out on me, Louis?

1626
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:04,809
Look, Floyd,
I was doing just fine

1627
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,177
before you showed up at my door.

1628
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:07,545
That's the thanks I get

1629
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:09,083
for pulling you out
of that fucking rat hole.

1630
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,413
You was just sitting up in there,

1631
01:10:10,485 --> 01:10:11,679
just sitting there waiting to die.

1632
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:12,879
Negro, please.

1633
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:14,546
You ain't no different from me,

1634
01:10:14,623 --> 01:10:17,251
Especially since your nephew
put your senile ass out to pasture

1635
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:18,486
and stole your business.

1636
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,391
Fuck you, Louis.

1637
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:23,522
Crawl back under that damn rock
you've been living.

1638
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:25,122
I don't need you.

1639
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,225
I'll do this shit by my damn self.

1640
01:10:27,302 --> 01:10:30,794
Yo! Turnkey!

1641
01:10:30,872 --> 01:10:32,635
Come on and let me
out of this motherfucker.

1642
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,471
I've had enough, man.
I want my lawyer.

1643
01:10:34,543 --> 01:10:35,567
Relax, relax.

1644
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:37,578
You ain't gonna need no lawyer.

1645
01:10:37,646 --> 01:10:39,773
Witnesses say
your story checks out,

1646
01:10:39,848 --> 01:10:42,578
so you, sir, are good to go.

1647
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:46,052
Yeah.

1648
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,589
Whoa. Hold on there, Chuck Berry.

1649
01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:50,887
You're gonna need a lawyer.

1650
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,690
Seems crossing state lines
is in violation of his parole,

1651
01:10:54,763 --> 01:10:56,731
Not to mention
possession of firearms

1652
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,095
and driving without a license.

1653
01:10:58,166 --> 01:10:59,224
No license?

1654
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:01,731
Step back for a minute.

1655
01:11:03,505 --> 01:11:05,905
I hope your ass rot up in here,

1656
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:07,942
you criminal-bound
motherfucker, you.

1657
01:11:08,009 --> 01:11:13,174
As Lao-Tzu says,
"Let things flow forward as they may. "

1658
01:11:13,248 --> 01:11:15,580
And I'm gonna let it flow, too, baby.

1659
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:19,848
And I got some Blackanese
philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

1660
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:22,412
You get by, Lou,
but you don't get away.

1661
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:24,755
You sit in shit,
you start to smell like it,

1662
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:26,384
so check the crack of your ass.

1663
01:11:26,461 --> 01:11:28,622
Here's something else for you.

1664
01:11:28,697 --> 01:11:30,824
Here go her number.

1665
01:11:31,867 --> 01:11:34,392
Call her... Daddy.

1666
01:11:36,071 --> 01:11:37,299
Fuck him, man!

1667
01:11:37,372 --> 01:11:39,135
Let's get on
out of this motherfucker.

1668
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:41,539
He ain't worth
two damn flies smashed.

1669
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:44,937
Nigger.

1670
01:11:52,387 --> 01:11:53,479
Hmph!

1671
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,930
Hey. Yo!

1672
01:12:06,768 --> 01:12:08,702
Can I make a phone call?

1673
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:26,648
<i>You walking out on me, Louis?</i>

1674
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:28,086
<i>I've had enough. I'm done.</i>

1675
01:12:28,156 --> 01:12:29,623
<i>You all right, man?</i>

1676
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:31,181
<i>Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.</i>

1677
01:12:31,259 --> 01:12:32,817
<i>You're not all right.
You can't hardly breathe.</i>

1678
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:34,794
<i>You need a chest X-ray.</i>

1679
01:12:34,863 --> 01:12:37,058
<i>I ain't trying to make no comeback.</i>

1680
01:12:37,132 --> 01:12:38,724
<i>I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.</i>

1681
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,097
<i>That's the thanks I get</i>

1682
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:41,430
<i>for pulling you out of that rat hole,</i>

1683
01:12:41,503 --> 01:12:42,629
<i>just sitting there waiting to die...</i>

1684
01:12:42,704 --> 01:12:44,296
<i>sitting there waiting to die...</i>

1685
01:12:44,372 --> 01:12:45,930
<i>- die, die...
- It's too late.</i>

1686
01:12:46,007 --> 01:12:47,668
<i>Is there a doctor in the house?</i>

1687
01:12:49,678 --> 01:12:52,044
<i>Keep it short.</i>

1688
01:12:52,113 --> 01:12:53,546
<i>- Hey...
- Hello.</i>

1689
01:12:53,615 --> 01:12:56,345
<i>It's Cleo. Please leave a message.</i>

1690
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:03,822
Cleo... um, this is, uh, Louis.

1691
01:13:03,892 --> 01:13:05,792
Louis Hinds.

1692
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:07,226
Your father.

1693
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:11,364
Wow, um,
feels funny saying that.

1694
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:13,594
I've, um, I've never said it before.

1695
01:13:13,668 --> 01:13:15,397
Um...

1696
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,937
Listen.

1697
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:21,169
I didn't mean what I said.

1698
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:22,608
I was...

1699
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:29,050
Odetta was the love of my life.

1700
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:30,914
The worst thing
that ever happened to me

1701
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:34,717
was losing her and you.

1702
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:36,120
But you turned out great.

1703
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:39,456
She did a wonderful job with you.

1704
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:42,292
You know your mother
was an amazing woman.

1705
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:43,888
And I just want you to know

1706
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:49,028
I'm really, really glad I met you.

1707
01:13:49,104 --> 01:13:50,196
And I wish I...

1708
01:13:55,677 --> 01:13:56,837
Yo.

1709
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:01,781
All right.

1710
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:13,022
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1711
01:14:13,094 --> 01:14:14,026
Hmm?

1712
01:14:14,095 --> 01:14:15,585
Busting your ass out of jail.

1713
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:17,894
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

1714
01:14:17,966 --> 01:14:19,297
Back up, Red. Get your keys out.

1715
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:20,356
Open that cell, okay?

1716
01:14:20,435 --> 01:14:21,561
Deputy, don't listen to him.

1717
01:14:21,636 --> 01:14:24,002
He will not shoot you.
Not on purpose anyway.

1718
01:14:24,072 --> 01:14:26,540
Don't let him get you fucked up, Red.

1719
01:14:26,608 --> 01:14:28,041
I'll kill you disco-dead.

1720
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:30,339
Now open that doggone cell, man.

1721
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:32,642
Stop shaking. If you shake,
I'm gonna start shaking.

1722
01:14:32,714 --> 01:14:34,011
Next thing you know, kapow!

1723
01:14:34,082 --> 01:14:35,310
Go on in.

1724
01:14:35,383 --> 01:14:36,441
Now hand him the keys.

1725
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:38,213
Hand them to him.

1726
01:14:38,286 --> 01:14:39,719
- Okay?
- Floyd.

1727
01:14:39,788 --> 01:14:41,449
You sure you want to do this?

1728
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:43,991
Does everything gotta be
a fucking argument with you?

1729
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:45,424
God damn! Come on out of there!

1730
01:14:45,493 --> 01:14:47,393
Close the door, Lou. Lock it up.

1731
01:14:47,462 --> 01:14:49,794
I'm a hostage.

1732
01:14:49,864 --> 01:14:51,263
You're gonna be a dead hostage

1733
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:52,459
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1734
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:55,630
Now look here, Red.

1735
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,262
I like you, almost.

1736
01:14:57,339 --> 01:15:00,240
You call anybody outside
your mama, kapow.

1737
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:01,798
Okay?

1738
01:15:02,644 --> 01:15:03,975
Let's get out of here.

1739
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:07,846
Anybody following us, man?

1740
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:08,974
Not yet.

1741
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:11,484
But you can bet your ass they will be.

1742
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:12,747
Lou, we gotta dump
the Mothership, man.

1743
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:13,981
We gotta dump it.

1744
01:15:14,055 --> 01:15:15,522
You'd abandon the Mothership?

1745
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,955
We're fugitives from the law.

1746
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:18,959
We gotta start thinking like it.

1747
01:15:19,027 --> 01:15:21,325
We're not fugitives, O.J.

1748
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:23,660
You're a fugitive. I'm a hostage.

1749
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:25,529
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

1750
01:15:30,372 --> 01:15:31,430
Wait, wait, wait.

1751
01:15:31,506 --> 01:15:33,030
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1752
01:15:33,108 --> 01:15:35,133
Look at that right there, man.

1753
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:37,474
Ain't that Lester's car?

1754
01:15:37,545 --> 01:15:39,479
Motherfuckers.

1755
01:15:44,519 --> 01:15:48,216
We're hungry, man. Come up with some
baked chicken or something.

1756
01:15:54,195 --> 01:15:55,162
They're at it again.

1757
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:01,892
Oh, shit! Lester's car!

1758
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:13,846
- You hear that?
- What?

1759
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:17,142
That.

1760
01:16:17,218 --> 01:16:21,382
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, no! Oh, God...

1761
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:24,751
Mr. Hinds. Mr. Henderson.

1762
01:16:24,826 --> 01:16:25,986
It's so good to see you.

1763
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:27,528
Oh, my God.

1764
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:31,031
Oh, it was so hot in there.
You have no idea.

1765
01:16:31,099 --> 01:16:33,090
If there's anything
I can get you,

1766
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:35,227
like a latte, I'm here for you guys.

1767
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:36,634
But first I really have to pee,

1768
01:16:36,705 --> 01:16:38,070
so I'm just gonna hop on out.

1769
01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:40,039
If you could give me
a hand out of here.

1770
01:16:40,108 --> 01:16:41,268
I've been locked in there,

1771
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:43,139
and they've had the woofers going all day.

1772
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:44,769
Oh, my God.

1773
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:47,212
I just have to pee real bad,
so if you don't mind.

1774
01:16:47,282 --> 01:16:48,340
It's so good to see you.

1775
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,247
Oh, Mr. Hinds...

1776
01:16:57,425 --> 01:16:59,791
Ahh...

1777
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:03,992

1782
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:12,633

Yeah. No, no. L... I understand.

1798
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:39,757
Uh, that's my other line.

1799
01:17:39,834 --> 01:17:41,392
I'll call you back. This is Danny.

1800
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:42,561
Hello, Mr. Epstein.

1801
01:17:42,637 --> 01:17:45,299
<i>Phillip Newman.
I broke your stapler last week.</i>

1802
01:17:45,373 --> 01:17:46,772
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- Hello?</i>

1803
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:48,069
Where the hell are you?

1804
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:49,940
Listen, I called
because I just wanted to let you know

1805
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:52,479
that everything's cool,
and we're still on target.

1806
01:17:52,547 --> 01:17:53,775
We?

1807
01:17:53,848 --> 01:17:55,509
You're with Henderson and Hinds?

1808
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,607
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1809
01:17:56,684 --> 01:17:58,174
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

1810
01:17:58,253 --> 01:17:59,515
but they're really good guys.

1811
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:01,077
All right, well, good.

1812
01:18:01,156 --> 01:18:02,487
You can give them this message.

1813
01:18:02,557 --> 01:18:04,286
The network just called,
and they're off the show.

1814
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:05,986
But they can't do that!

1815
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,789
Oh, really? It's VH1.

1816
01:18:07,862 --> 01:18:09,295
<i>Have you seen Flava of Love?</i>

1817
01:18:09,364 --> 01:18:11,264
They can pretty much do
whatever they want.

1818
01:18:11,332 --> 01:18:13,527
And another thing, you're fired.

1819
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:16,627
Motherfucker! What the fuck?

1820
01:18:25,313 --> 01:18:26,143
What'd he say?

1821
01:18:27,582 --> 01:18:30,312
Uh, he said I'm fired,

1822
01:18:30,385 --> 01:18:34,845
and... and, uh,
and you're off the show.

1823
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:43,592
Are... Are you serious, man?

1824
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:46,525
I'm so sorry.

1825
01:19:03,751 --> 01:19:06,811
Nnn! Nnn! Nnn!

1826
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:33,440
You know, uh,
according to the map,

1827
01:19:33,514 --> 01:19:36,711
that road leads to the turnpike.

1828
01:19:36,784 --> 01:19:38,411
I think we've still got time to make it.

1829
01:19:38,486 --> 01:19:41,046
Make what, Louis?

1830
01:19:41,122 --> 01:19:42,987
You heard what the motherfucker said!

1831
01:19:43,057 --> 01:19:44,115
It's over!

1832
01:19:44,192 --> 01:19:45,625
Fuck that.

1833
01:19:49,764 --> 01:19:54,064
This shit ain't over till we
say it's over, all right?

1834
01:19:56,337 --> 01:19:57,736
Things have changed,

1835
01:19:57,805 --> 01:20:01,866
and I have achieved
a state of mental clarity.

1836
01:20:01,943 --> 01:20:03,171
Ain't that a bitch?

1837
01:20:03,244 --> 01:20:04,472
You hear what this motherfucker said?

1838
01:20:04,545 --> 01:20:07,343
Ever since I knocked
on your door, man,

1839
01:20:07,415 --> 01:20:09,610
you've been beating my balls
at every fucking turn.

1840
01:20:09,684 --> 01:20:13,347
Now all of a sudden, you've
got a state of clarity.

1841
01:20:13,421 --> 01:20:15,150
Where was your clarity in L.A., Lou?

1842
01:20:15,223 --> 01:20:16,713
You can't just dial that shit up

1843
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:19,055
like you calling for a pizza, motherfucker.

1844
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:21,960
You got to go inside, do the work.

1845
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,624
Consequently,
I have a confession.

1846
01:20:26,067 --> 01:20:30,401
Floyd, you were right about me.

1847
01:20:30,471 --> 01:20:34,464
I have given up on a lot
of things in my life.

1848
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:37,010
But I ain't giving up on this. All right?

1849
01:20:37,078 --> 01:20:40,878
Come on, man, we've been through
enough shit the last few days.

1850
01:20:40,949 --> 01:20:42,348
We can do this.

1851
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:45,147
And I dare anybody
to try to stop us.

1852
01:20:45,219 --> 01:20:47,187
Let's go, motherfucker.

1853
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:48,381
Shotgun.

1854
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:51,248
Get your ass in the backseat.

1855
01:20:51,492 --> 01:20:54,325
<i>Ain't no stoppin' us now</i>

1856
01:20:54,395 --> 01:20:56,192
<i>We're on the move</i>

1857
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:03,437
<i>There's been so many
things that's held us down</i>

1858
01:21:03,504 --> 01:21:05,335
<i>But now it looks</i>

1859
01:21:05,406 --> 01:21:08,239
<i>Like things are finally coming around</i>

1860
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:13,546
<i>Don't you let nothing, nothing</i>

1861
01:21:13,614 --> 01:21:17,607
<i>Stand in your way</i>

1862
01:21:17,685 --> 01:21:21,485
<i>I want y'all to listen, listen</i>

1863
01:21:21,556 --> 01:21:25,083
<i>To every word I say,
every word I say</i>

1864
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:27,627
<i>Ain't no stopping us now</i>

1865
01:21:27,695 --> 01:21:29,060
<i>No, no, no</i>

1866
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,597
<i>We're on the move</i>

1867
01:21:30,665 --> 01:21:33,930
<i>The movin' groovin'</i>

1868
01:21:34,002 --> 01:21:36,368
<i>Ain't no stopping us now</i>

1869
01:21:36,437 --> 01:21:38,371
Full sound and switch on all
the floor monitors, all right?

1870
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:40,600
Look at that.
That's nice and subtle.

1871
01:21:40,675 --> 01:21:41,801
I'm on it, then. Sound check.

1872
01:21:41,876 --> 01:21:42,843
Okay. Thanks.

1873
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:43,842
- Mr. Epstein.
- Yeah?

1874
01:21:43,911 --> 01:21:45,208
Hey, thank God you're here.

1875
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:46,439
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

1876
01:21:46,514 --> 01:21:48,345
What are you doing here?
I thought I fired you.

1877
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:50,577
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not alone.

1878
01:21:56,824 --> 01:21:58,189
You guys are insane!

1879
01:21:58,259 --> 01:21:59,886
Good to see you, too, Little Ep.

1880
01:21:59,961 --> 01:22:02,054
Yeah, this is never going to happen.

1881
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:04,826
You'll be arrested
the moment the cops spot you.

1882
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:06,696
We don't care anything about that.

1883
01:22:06,768 --> 01:22:08,702
We just want to do our song.

1884
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:11,000
Oh, one other thing.
You got a few minutes?

1885
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,539
Yeah, I got all the time
in the world.

1886
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:14,234
I'm just producing a television show

1887
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:15,935
with dozens of huge musical acts

1888
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:18,137
that goes live in 171/2 minutes,

1889
01:22:18,212 --> 01:22:20,146
but you know, let's grab some coffee
and have a little chit-chat.

1890
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:28,253
Wow. How long's he got?

1891
01:22:30,124 --> 01:22:31,216
We don't know.

1892
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:34,250
All right.

1893
01:22:34,328 --> 01:22:36,387
I'll see what I can do. Okay?

1894
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:38,056
Thank you.

1895
01:22:41,335 --> 01:22:44,395
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and
gentlemen,</i>

1896
01:22:44,472 --> 01:22:46,463
<i>please take your seats.</i>

1897
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,805
<i>The ceremony will begin shortly.</i>

1898
01:22:53,514 --> 01:22:54,981
I'll get it.

1899
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,312
Wow!

1900
01:23:00,388 --> 01:23:01,855
The Black Moses.

1901
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:03,957
How's it going, man?

1902
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:05,117
Hey, what's happening?

1903
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:06,125
What's up, baby?

1904
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:07,126
Hey, fellas.

1905
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:08,526
Hey, what's happening?

1906
01:23:08,596 --> 01:23:10,029
- The man.
- My man.

1907
01:23:10,098 --> 01:23:11,224
Okay, all right.

1908
01:23:11,299 --> 01:23:13,494
Heard you were here.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

1909
01:23:14,635 --> 01:23:15,624
Oh, by the way,

1910
01:23:15,703 --> 01:23:17,295
brought somebody by to see you.

1911
01:23:17,371 --> 01:23:18,429
Oh, is that right?

1912
01:23:18,506 --> 01:23:19,803
Yeah.

1913
01:23:27,548 --> 01:23:29,106
Okay, everybody,
let's move on out of here.

1914
01:23:29,183 --> 01:23:30,411
Come on.

1915
01:23:30,485 --> 01:23:32,350
All right, you heard what Mr. Henderson said.

1916
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,352
After you, young man.

1917
01:23:33,421 --> 01:23:35,150
Okay.

1918
01:23:54,742 --> 01:23:57,802
I'm sorry I ran out the way I did.

1919
01:23:59,013 --> 01:24:01,345
I'm the one who ran out.

1920
01:24:01,415 --> 01:24:03,542
There's no need for you to apologize.

1921
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:11,287
Can I help you with your tie?

1922
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:12,656
Yeah, sure.

1923
01:24:12,727 --> 01:24:14,752
You know what you're doing?

1924
01:24:14,829 --> 01:24:16,660
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1925
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:19,826
Here you go.

1926
01:24:21,936 --> 01:24:23,767
Mm! Ohh!

1927
01:24:25,406 --> 01:24:26,634
You all right?

1928
01:24:26,707 --> 01:24:28,504
Yeah. Just some water, please.

1929
01:24:28,576 --> 01:24:29,543
Damn!

1930
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:30,907
All cameras are on point.

1931
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:32,172
We just added two mics.

1932
01:24:32,246 --> 01:24:33,907
Mr. Epstein!
You better come quick.

1933
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:35,573
Come on, I'm serious.
Come on! It's important!

1934
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,810
All right. Take care of those.

1935
01:24:36,884 --> 01:24:37,908
15 minutes, Danny.

1936
01:24:40,755 --> 01:24:41,847
He just collapsed.

1937
01:24:41,923 --> 01:24:43,652
I think he's in a lot of pain.

1938
01:24:43,724 --> 01:24:45,191
Open your hand.
Open your hand.

1939
01:24:45,259 --> 01:24:46,317
Right there, right there.

1940
01:24:46,394 --> 01:24:48,760
Okay, okay.

1941
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:52,263
Be strong, brother.
Hang on in there.

1942
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:54,198
It ain't time for you to check out now.

1943
01:24:54,268 --> 01:24:55,530
Check out? What?

1944
01:24:55,603 --> 01:24:57,935
Come on, man.
Everybody knows, man.

1945
01:24:58,005 --> 01:25:00,337
My aunt was taking the same
doggone pills, man.

1946
01:25:00,408 --> 01:25:03,070
Took her about a week
before she wasted away to nothing,

1947
01:25:03,144 --> 01:25:04,338
just kicking and screaming.

1948
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:05,777
I don't know what killed her ass,

1949
01:25:05,846 --> 01:25:09,145
but if she was taking those,
she had a bladder infection.

1950
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:10,343
Say what?

1951
01:25:10,418 --> 01:25:13,581
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,
I got a kidney stone.

1952
01:25:13,654 --> 01:25:15,144
Hurts like a motherfucker
when I pee,

1953
01:25:15,223 --> 01:25:16,485
but it ain't gonna kill me.

1954
01:25:16,557 --> 01:25:17,751
So you're not dying?

1955
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:21,192
From the first slap and cry,
we all start to die.

1956
01:25:21,262 --> 01:25:23,924
But I ain't on no accelerated program,
hell, no.

1957
01:25:23,998 --> 01:25:26,193
Ain't that about a bitch?

1958
01:25:26,267 --> 01:25:29,134
All that damn hard work,
busting your ass out of jail,

1959
01:25:29,203 --> 01:25:30,363
and you ain't even dying.

1960
01:25:30,438 --> 01:25:31,803
I was kinda looking forward
to seeing you go.

1961
01:25:31,872 --> 01:25:34,067
Excuse me, Danny.
They're on in two.

1962
01:25:34,141 --> 01:25:35,733
All right. Where we at, guys?

1963
01:25:36,944 --> 01:25:38,639
Okay, I'm good.

1964
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:44,108
The Apollo, the mecca.

1965
01:25:44,185 --> 01:25:45,584
This brings back memories, man.

1966
01:25:45,653 --> 01:25:47,280
How many times you think
we've performed here?

1967
01:25:47,355 --> 01:25:48,549
Ooh, uh...

1968
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:49,920
ooh, five-oh.

1969
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:50,958
50, really?

1970
01:25:51,025 --> 01:25:52,390
- Five-oh.
- Oh!

1971
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:53,620
Come on. Move, move.

1972
01:25:53,694 --> 01:25:55,457
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

1973
01:25:55,529 --> 01:25:57,793
<i>All units report, all units report.</i>

1974
01:25:57,865 --> 01:25:59,264
<i>Suspects have been spotted.</i>

1975
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:02,302
<i>All units, apprehend them quietly
and by the book.</i>

1976
01:26:03,671 --> 01:26:05,639
Hey, Lou, do you think
they're gone, man?

1977
01:26:05,706 --> 01:26:07,230
I don't have X-ray vision, motherfucker!

1978
01:26:07,308 --> 01:26:08,332
How would I know?

1979
01:26:08,409 --> 01:26:10,639
Lower your voice, Lou.
Doggone it, man.

1980
01:26:10,711 --> 01:26:12,542
It's so dark in here you can't see shit.

1981
01:26:12,613 --> 01:26:13,841
Hold up.

1982
01:26:13,914 --> 01:26:15,347
Let me see if I can reach my lighter.

1983
01:26:15,416 --> 01:26:16,542
Don't light no lighter
up in here, man.

1984
01:26:16,617 --> 01:26:18,107
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

1985
01:26:18,185 --> 01:26:19,777
Hold on one minute.

1986
01:26:19,854 --> 01:26:21,549
Shit.

1987
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:28,319
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

1988
01:26:28,396 --> 01:26:30,796
Long way from Linwood Street, huh,
motherfucker?

1989
01:26:30,865 --> 01:26:33,197
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

1990
01:26:33,267 --> 01:26:35,201
He used both of us, and you know it.

1991
01:26:35,269 --> 01:26:37,863
Come on, man. He just thought
he'd be a bigger star going solo.

1992
01:26:37,938 --> 01:26:38,927
He was right.

1993
01:26:39,006 --> 01:26:40,268
No he wasn't.

1994
01:26:40,341 --> 01:26:42,002
He didn't want to split
the money three ways.

1995
01:26:42,076 --> 01:26:43,202
Just look at him, sitting there

1996
01:26:43,277 --> 01:26:45,336
with that old shit-eating
grin on his face.

1997
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:47,904
You think you're all that, motherfucker,
don't you?

1998
01:26:47,982 --> 01:26:49,813
I have to admit, every time
I think about you,

1999
01:26:49,884 --> 01:26:52,148
I could just choke the shit out of you!

2000
01:26:52,219 --> 01:26:53,345
Stop it, stop it!

2001
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:55,252
Floyd, he ain't
thinking shit. He's dead.

2002
01:26:57,892 --> 01:27:00,952
Say, ain't that my watch?

2003
01:27:01,028 --> 01:27:03,019
See? You thought
I stole that mother...

2004
01:27:03,097 --> 01:27:05,122
I told you this motherfucker
was a klepto!

2005
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,564
Shit, look at that.

2006
01:27:06,634 --> 01:27:07,999
That's nice.

2007
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:09,161
Probably stole that, too.

2008
01:27:09,236 --> 01:27:11,500
Motherfucker always had
good taste, though.

2009
01:27:11,572 --> 01:27:12,903
I'm gonna keep this.

2010
01:27:17,545 --> 01:27:19,376
Hey, Louis.

2011
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:21,642
You think if, you know...

2012
01:27:21,716 --> 01:27:23,684
if he wouldn't have, you know, died,

2013
01:27:23,751 --> 01:27:25,048
you think we would have
got back together?

2014
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:26,711
Oh, hell, no.

2015
01:27:26,787 --> 01:27:28,618
But you know what?

2016
01:27:28,689 --> 01:27:29,747
We are together,

2017
01:27:29,824 --> 01:27:31,883
and I've been thinking
about our little arrangement.

2018
01:27:31,959 --> 01:27:32,948
I'm gonna go ahead

2019
01:27:33,027 --> 01:27:36,155
and break you off 50/50, all right?

2020
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:37,822
Wow, Lou, that's...

2021
01:27:37,898 --> 01:27:40,560
that's real black of you, man.

2022
01:27:40,634 --> 01:27:42,261
Because there ain't no money.

2023
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,360
Say what?

2024
01:27:43,437 --> 01:27:45,405
Well, you said it yourself.

2025
01:27:45,473 --> 01:27:46,462
It's a funeral.

2026
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:47,700
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

2027
01:27:47,775 --> 01:27:49,174
You lied about the money?

2028
01:27:49,243 --> 01:27:51,177
- Yeah.
- You motherfucker.

2029
01:27:51,245 --> 01:27:53,110
Hey, you can't say
it wasn't worth it.

2030
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,045
Well, I could say it.

2031
01:27:56,917 --> 01:27:58,714
But I'd be lying.

2032
01:27:58,786 --> 01:28:00,447
I love you, Lou.

2033
01:28:00,521 --> 01:28:02,614
My nigger.

2034
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:04,715
But this motherfucker,
you know, I can't help it.

2035
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:06,885
Every time,
I could just kill this motherfucker!

2036
01:28:06,961 --> 01:28:08,929
That's why he left, because
you was always picking on him.

2037
01:28:08,996 --> 01:28:10,054
Stop fucking with him.

2038
01:28:10,131 --> 01:28:12,031
He fucked with my happiness.

2039
01:28:20,941 --> 01:28:22,670
Ladies and gentlemen,

2040
01:28:22,743 --> 01:28:25,211
I'm Isaac Hayes.

2041
01:28:27,047 --> 01:28:29,038
Where the fuck are they, Danny?

2042
01:28:29,116 --> 01:28:32,142
My good friends, please join me

2043
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:35,985
in saying farewell
to brother Marcus Hooks.

2044
01:28:41,996 --> 01:28:43,361
It's Louis and Floyd!

2045
01:28:43,431 --> 01:28:44,557
It's the Real Deal!

2046
01:28:44,632 --> 01:28:47,624
Oh!

2047
01:28:47,701 --> 01:28:50,499
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal,

2048
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:52,300
back together again.

2049
01:28:52,373 --> 01:28:55,302
Give them a hand.

2050
01:28:55,376 --> 01:28:58,277
Reunited, y'all.

2051
01:28:58,345 --> 01:28:59,744
They got their shit together.

2052
01:28:59,814 --> 01:29:02,647
Yes! Let's go!

2053
01:29:02,716 --> 01:29:04,547
Stand by.
Move in on my command.

2054
01:29:04,618 --> 01:29:06,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2055
01:29:06,153 --> 01:29:07,814
Come on, Officer
detective person.

2056
01:29:07,888 --> 01:29:09,150
Please, just, you know, come on.

2057
01:29:09,223 --> 01:29:11,088
Let them sing one song.
One little song.

2058
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:12,819
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

2059
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:14,520
The Real Deal!

2060
01:29:16,797 --> 01:29:19,857
All right. One song.

2061
01:29:19,934 --> 01:29:21,834
But it better be good.

2062
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:25,862
One song. The good one.

2063
01:29:30,478 --> 01:29:31,604
How's that hip?

2064
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:32,771
Locked and loaded, baby.

2065
01:29:32,847 --> 01:29:34,109
Let's do this.

2066
01:29:35,549 --> 01:29:37,244
Band!

2067
01:29:37,318 --> 01:29:39,309
Let's take a walk in the park.

2068
01:29:39,386 --> 01:29:41,684
1, 2, 3, 4!

2069
01:29:53,234 --> 01:29:55,395
Oh, yeah

2070
01:29:55,469 --> 01:29:57,835
When the river gets to rollin'

2071
01:29:57,905 --> 01:30:01,534
And then you add
a bowlful of soul in

2072
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:04,874
And then I tried
to let it all go then

2073
01:30:04,945 --> 01:30:06,606
Oh, yeah

2074
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,807
Oh, it's easy to me

2075
01:30:08,883 --> 01:30:12,250
You see, the way
I ride the rhythm

2076
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:15,880
You see, the truth
is all I can give 'em

2077
01:30:15,956 --> 01:30:18,652
And the lyrics can
come from livin'

2078
01:30:18,726 --> 01:30:22,423
Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me

2079
01:30:22,496 --> 01:30:24,191
Oh, yeah

2080
01:30:24,265 --> 01:30:28,224
Music comes out of my heart

2081
01:30:28,302 --> 01:30:32,261
Something like a walking the park

2082
01:30:32,339 --> 01:30:35,399
It's just a walk in the park

2083
01:30:35,476 --> 01:30:37,273
Oh, yeah

2084
01:30:37,344 --> 01:30:40,074
And no one else in here, I heard it

2085
01:30:40,147 --> 01:30:43,776
I don't know what I've
done to deserve it

2086
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:47,446
You don't question it
while you serve it

2087
01:30:47,521 --> 01:30:48,783
Oh, yeah

2088
01:30:48,856 --> 01:30:50,847
Oh, it was given to me

2089
01:30:50,925 --> 01:30:54,452
I got something you inherit

2090
01:30:54,528 --> 01:30:57,554
I don't know that you
was born to share it

2091
01:30:57,631 --> 01:31:01,567
And if you shoot,
be sure you wear it

2092
01:31:01,635 --> 01:31:03,569
Oh, yeah

2093
01:31:03,637 --> 01:31:04,968
Oh, it comes naturally to me

2094
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:07,269
Uh-huh-uh

2095
01:31:07,341 --> 01:31:09,434
Music comes out of my heart

2096
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:10,977
Yeah

2097
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:14,640
Something like a walk in the park

2098
01:31:14,715 --> 01:31:16,706
It's just a walk in the park

2099
01:31:16,784 --> 01:31:19,649
Oh, yeah

2100
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,450
Oh, yeah!

2101
01:31:22,523 --> 01:31:24,582
Y'all having a good time
out here tonight?

2102
01:31:24,658 --> 01:31:26,683
This is what I'm talking about!

2103
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,921
You know about that
walk in the park, man?

2104
01:31:28,996 --> 01:31:30,486
Sure I know about
that walk in the park.

2105
01:31:30,564 --> 01:31:32,054
You do? I'll tell you what.

2106
01:31:32,132 --> 01:31:33,895
- Show them.
- Got to get down.

2107
01:31:41,709 --> 01:31:42,903
Ladies and gentlemen,

2108
01:31:42,977 --> 01:31:44,968
let's give a big Apollo welcome

2109
01:31:45,045 --> 01:31:46,945
to the stage for the first time,

2110
01:31:47,014 --> 01:31:51,144
my daughter, Miss Cleo Whitfield!

2111
01:31:51,218 --> 01:31:54,813
To make something out of nothin'

2112
01:31:54,888 --> 01:31:58,324
That's what we all
got in common

2113
01:31:58,392 --> 01:32:01,919
So just hold on tight, I'm comin'

2114
01:32:01,996 --> 01:32:03,930
Oh, yeah, yeah

2115
01:32:03,998 --> 01:32:05,431
Said to me

2116
01:32:05,499 --> 01:32:08,662
I'll give you something
you can believe in

2117
01:32:08,736 --> 01:32:12,502
And then enjoy yourself
this evenin'

2118
01:32:12,573 --> 01:32:15,804
And don't you dare
think about leavin'

2119
01:32:15,876 --> 01:32:17,673
Oh, yeah

2120
01:32:17,745 --> 01:32:21,579
Sing along with me

2121
01:32:21,649 --> 01:32:25,176
Music comes out of my heart

2122
01:32:25,252 --> 01:32:27,652
Something like a walk
in the park

2123
01:32:27,721 --> 01:32:30,981
It's just a walk in the park

2124
01:32:31,058 --> 01:32:32,650
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

2125
01:32:32,726 --> 01:32:34,318
Oh, yeah

2126
01:32:35,829 --> 01:32:38,662
Music comes out of my heart

2127
01:32:38,732 --> 01:32:43,101
Something like a walk
in the park

2128
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:45,968
It's just a walk in the park

2129
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,304
Oh, yeah

2130
01:32:50,077 --> 01:32:52,773
Music comes out of my heart

2131
01:32:52,846 --> 01:32:54,279
One song.

2132
01:32:54,348 --> 01:32:56,441
Something like a walk in the park

2133
01:32:56,517 --> 01:32:57,814
A walk in the park

2134
01:32:57,885 --> 01:32:59,853
It's just a walk in the park

2135
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,182
A walk in the park

2136
01:33:01,255 --> 01:33:03,223
Oh, yeah

2137
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:05,815
Music comes out of my heart

2138
01:33:05,893 --> 01:33:07,952
I'm their manager!

2139
01:33:08,028 --> 01:33:10,121
Something like a walk in the park

2140
01:33:10,197 --> 01:33:11,960
Walk in the park

2141
01:33:12,032 --> 01:33:13,226
It's just a walk in the park

2142
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:19,364
Just like a walk in the park

2143
01:33:21,608 --> 01:33:24,839
Oh, yeah

2144
01:33:39,259 --> 01:33:40,521
Whoo!

2145
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,203
<i>Yeah, ooh, yeah</i>

2146
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,928
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo

2147
01:34:14,995 --> 01:34:16,053
Haah

2148
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:17,825
You're gonna sing real nice tonight.

2149
01:34:19,933 --> 01:34:20,991
<i>All right, y'all.</i>

2150
01:34:21,068 --> 01:34:23,764
<i>Got that funky time</i>

2151
01:34:23,837 --> 01:34:32,442
<i>I can feel it</i>

2152
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:36,447
Any time the camera
or the mic comes on,

2153
01:34:36,517 --> 01:34:37,950
I don't cheat myself.

2154
01:34:38,018 --> 01:34:40,418
That was rule number 1
I was taught as a kid.

2155
01:34:40,487 --> 01:34:42,284
And I definitely can't
cheat the audience.

2156
01:34:42,356 --> 01:34:44,153
So I give 150%% %

2157
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:47,318
every single time that I do anything.

2158
01:34:47,394 --> 01:34:49,157
Even the way I live my life.

2159
01:34:49,229 --> 01:34:52,096
I just cherish
each doggone moment.

2160
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:54,691
A black preacher's
something else, ain't it?

2161
01:34:54,768 --> 01:34:57,794
You can't pay your rent
after you come from church.

2162
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,774
And if you ask the preacher
for the $5.00,

2163
01:35:01,842 --> 01:35:04,834
he'll be like, "Fuck you
in the name of Jesus. "

2164
01:35:04,912 --> 01:35:07,676
My comedy is not fictitious.

2165
01:35:07,748 --> 01:35:11,013
My comedy has
to come from my heart.

2166
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:16,416
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.
- All right, let's rehearse.

2167
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:19,015
He went through China
with his shit in his hand.

2168
01:35:19,092 --> 01:35:21,583
Had five women against the wall.

2169
01:35:21,662 --> 01:35:24,392
I betcha five dollars
that he fucked them all.

2170
01:35:24,464 --> 01:35:25,761
He fucked them hard.

2171
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:26,959
He fucked them long.

2172
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:29,594
He fucked them till his shit got sore.

2173
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:32,138
He went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

2174
01:35:32,206 --> 01:35:34,538
"Sorry, Charlie, your dick is dead. "

2175
01:35:34,608 --> 01:35:37,441
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,
that can't be true. "

2176
01:35:37,511 --> 01:35:40,139
"Yes, sir, Charlie,
your balls are too!"

2177
01:35:41,982 --> 01:35:43,745
I've been performing all my life.

2178
01:35:43,817 --> 01:35:45,478
So being in front of an audience

2179
01:35:45,552 --> 01:35:47,179
has never been a problem for me.

2180
01:35:47,254 --> 01:35:49,085
It's time to go?

2181
01:35:50,023 --> 01:35:51,388
Well, go on, then.

2182
01:35:54,294 --> 01:35:57,058
You want to leave a lasting impression
on your audience.

2183
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:59,690
You know, and that's something
I was taught, too,

2184
01:35:59,766 --> 01:36:01,063
when I first started.

2185
01:36:01,134 --> 01:36:02,362
Always make them remember you,

2186
01:36:02,436 --> 01:36:05,234
or remember something
about you and the film.

2187
01:36:05,305 --> 01:36:08,934
I'm going back to my
$600-a-night hotel room,

2188
01:36:09,009 --> 01:36:13,946
have me a nice-ass, uh,
piece of pussy and shit.

2189
01:36:14,014 --> 01:36:15,072
Okay?

2190
01:36:15,148 --> 01:36:17,207
Cut it.

2191
01:36:18,986 --> 01:36:20,078
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

2192
01:36:20,153 --> 01:36:22,178
I'm not even in yet.

2193
01:36:22,256 --> 01:36:26,392
I got to boogie for you

2194
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,724
I got nothin' but boogie

2195
01:36:28,795 --> 01:36:31,093
Nothin' but boogie for you

2196
01:36:31,164 --> 01:36:33,064
I got nothin' but boogie

2197
01:36:33,133 --> 01:36:34,760
Nothin' but boogie for you

2198
01:36:34,835 --> 01:36:42,374
Boogie, boogie

2199
01:36:45,545 --> 01:36:48,275
I want to say thanks to you all

2200
01:36:48,348 --> 01:36:52,079
because you all made me... yeah.

2201
01:36:56,256 --> 01:36:59,054
I wouldn't have
no TV show or movies.

2202
01:36:59,126 --> 01:37:00,991
You all was coming to see me,

2203
01:37:01,061 --> 01:37:02,722
and you all made me...

2204
01:37:02,796 --> 01:37:05,731
Chattanooga, Louisiana, Mississippi.

2205
01:37:06,934 --> 01:37:08,925
So thank you.

2206
01:37:09,002 --> 01:37:11,562
I think if I had a few free passes

2207
01:37:11,638 --> 01:37:12,935
like a lot of people,

2208
01:37:13,006 --> 01:37:15,497
I don't think I would be
as successful as I have.

2209
01:37:15,575 --> 01:37:17,236
My task here on Earth

2210
01:37:17,311 --> 01:37:20,439
is I have to work harder
than the average bear.

2211
01:37:20,514 --> 01:37:21,446
It look easy, don't it?

2212
01:37:21,515 --> 01:37:24,313
But it's not.

2213
01:37:24,384 --> 01:37:26,909
Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you.

2214
01:37:30,958 --> 01:37:35,622
<i>I never can say goodbye</i>
