1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,569
Marcus Hooks
and the Real Deal, take 6.

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,605
- That's three names.
- You want me to sing the main line?

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,233
Oh, yeah, here we go, here we go.

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,743
<i>Tonight we take a musical journey south,</i>

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,780
<i>where the legendary soul band</i>
<i>Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,782
<i>developed their signature sound.</i>

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,249
1, 2!

8
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,317
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh #

9
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:29,007
<i>They started out singing for</i>
<i>pennies on the street corners of Memphis.</i>

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,829
# Pull the string #

11
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,389
# And I'll wink at you #

12
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,059
# I'm your puppet #

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,169
# Mm-hmm, yeah #

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,174
# I'll do funny things #

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,710
# If you want me to #

16
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,507
# I'm your puppet #

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,548
# I'm yours #

18
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,350
# To have and to hold #

19
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,981
# Darling, you've got #

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,889
# Full control #

21
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,722
# Of your puppet #

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,196
<i>But by 1972,</i>

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,754
<i>Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

24
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,063
<i>had become one of the biggest
R&B acts in the world.</i>

25
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,229
# Nothin' like sweet soul music #

26
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,239
# To bring us together #

27
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,901
<i>They played to sellout houses</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

28
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,671
<i>They'd sold 6 million records</i>

29
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,407
<i>and influenced a generation</i>
<i>of American musicians.</i>

30
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,314
# Dance to the sweet soul music #

31
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,316
# Yahh #

32
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,354
<i>But that all ended
on July 24, 1977,</i>

33
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,389
<i>when Marcus Hooks</i>
<i>began his solo career</i>

34
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,426
<i>with a dramatic concert at
New York's Madison Square Garden.</i>

35
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,120
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,993
<i>Marcus Hooks.</i>

37
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,497
Marcus.

38
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,598
# Ooh-ooh-ooh #

39
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,870
Hey, boy, hi.

40
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,377
Hey, boy, dance.

41
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,537
Yeah.

42
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,604
<i>But while Hooks</i>
<i>became a music legend,</i>

43
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,412
<i>the journey took</i>
<i>a decidedly different direction</i>

44
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,181
<i>for former band mates</i>
<i>Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds.</i>

45
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,051
<i>Renowned for their</i>
<i>signature dance stylings</i>

46
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,821
<i>from their one</i>
<i>breakout hit, "Walk in the Park,"</i>

47
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,385
<i>the duo broke up in 1979.</i>

48
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,953
<i>citing creative differences</i>

49
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,898
<i>and a desire to pursue
separate projects.</i>

50
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,061
Back off! Freeze!

51
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,399
Get your hands up! Let me see them!

52
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,598
Oh. Wait. Wait, wait.
It ain't... Ohh!

53
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,471
The gun ain't real! Ow!
It ain't real! Ow!

54
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,238
I'm just broke, God it!

55
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,835
I ain't tryin' to hurt no!

56
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,380
Watch your damn hands!

57
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,915
Police mother brutality!

58
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,348
<i>While Floyd Henderson...</i>

59
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,514
Come on down to Floyd's Car Wash,

60
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,647
where everything is done by hand.

61
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,487
<i>...combined his showmanship</i>

62
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,754
<i>with an entrepreneur spirit.</i>

63
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,955
And don't forget about
Super Soul Sundays,

64
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,123
with a full body wash

65
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,258
to guarantee a free rimjob.

66
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,997
Come on. Get your rimjob.

67
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,164
Come get your rimjob.

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,504
Come and get your rimjob!

69
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,602
<i>Whatever happened</i>
<i>to the forgotten duo...</i>

70
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,078
<i>The Real Deal?</i>

71
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,614
Baby, turn the navigation on.

72
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,348
I hope we can find this place
sometime tonight.

73
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,014
He gonna love it there.

74
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,115
They got Craftmatic adjustable beds,

75
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,218
clap-on lamps.

76
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,126
Y'all better shut up back there,
I'm tellin' you.

77
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,391
I'm gonna reach back there

78
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,932
and pop one of them little boys
upside the head so bad.

79
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,163
I think that's it, Uncle Floyd.

80
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,000
Whoo!

81
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,906
Now, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this bullshit.

82
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,968
What you talking about?
It's beautiful. You don't like this?

83
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,138
It's a death camp.

84
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,546
Oh, how is it a death camp, Unc?

85
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,743
We got 36 holes of golf.

86
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,445
Three swimming pools.

87
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,420
You know the ratio
of women to men here

88
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,082
is 5 to 1, Unc? 5 to 1.

89
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,455
That mean you got 'em everywhere.

90
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,788
You can't even move.
There's women...

91
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,327
Every time you look around,

92
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,454
women crawling between your legs,
arms, anything.

93
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,364
I mean, damn, Unc.
And if you're worried about the business,

94
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,458
I got that.

95
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,264
You taught me everything you know.

96
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,929
Yeah.

97
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,973
Yeah. You know something, son?

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,007
You're real crafty.

99
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,007
Appreciate that.

100
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,566
See, first you move into my house.

101
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,339
Then you take over my business.

102
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,936
- Aw, man, I ain't taking...
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,675
Then you move me
all the way out to the Valley, man,

104
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,273
so can't nobody hear me scream. Right?

105
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,717
Actually, that's why
we're moving you here.

106
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,777
So the nurses can hear your ass scream.

107
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,220
You remember you fell on that floor
for three days

108
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,258
- and couldn't nobody hear you.
- I remember.

109
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:23,659
Yeah. Now, stop being bitter, man.
Enjoy yourself, Unc.

110
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,494
There are your golden years, player.

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,192
Now, come on
in the house and say bye

112
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,930
to Charlene and the kids.

113
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,462
Fuck them kids.

114
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,564
Fuck the kids?

115
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,734
Yeah.

116
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,769
Ohh...

117
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,917
- Ohhh... yeah, baby.
- Ohh! Ohh!

118
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,081
Ohh! Oh, give it to me.
Give it to me nice and hard.

119
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,591
Oh, <i>¡papi, síl</i> Ooh!

120
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,819
Oh, right there!

121
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,555
Ohhhhh!

122
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,120
Uhh! Ohh!

123
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,825
Ooh. Don't stop, baby.

124
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,832
No.

125
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,061
No.

126
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,568
No, you're not getting away.

127
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,899
Hoo hoo! Hoo hoo!

128
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:39,903
Yummy!

129
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,837
Uhh! Uhh! Yeah.

130
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,300
Aah!

131
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,882
Mmm...

132
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,422
How's the hip?

133
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,622
Fine.

134
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,723
Okay.

135
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,936
Okay, Mr. Henderson.
I'm gonna need you

136
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,604
to, uh, stands up, face the window,

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,375
and bend over the table.

138
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,245
My problem ain't back
in that area, doctor.

139
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,512
Look, Mr. Henderson,
your sleep problem

140
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,054
can be a symptom of a myriad
of different conditions,

141
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,350
some of which, you know, are...

142
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,618
well, you know, back in that area.

143
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,163
I don't like nobody
behind me like that, Huds.

144
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,994
I'm telling you, I just don't like
nobody playing

145
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,727
- with my penny.
- I'll be very gentle.

146
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,291
I'll be in and out before you know it.

147
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,398
Just bend over. There you go.

148
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,102
Hold on, now. Get a good grip.

149
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,109
Ohh...

150
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,577
Just relax.

151
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,578
Relax.

152
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,705
# Sittin' on #

153
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,046
# The dock of the bay #

154
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,049
# Watching the #

155
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,144
# Tiiiiiide #

156
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,314
# Roll away #

157
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,618
# Ooh ooh #

158
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,786
All right, again, Mr. Henderson,

159
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,691
there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

160
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,024
So take those for insomnia.

161
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,088
Give me a call if anything changes.
All right?

162
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,690
- All right.
- Do me a favor.

163
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,429
Stop being so hard
on yourself, Mr. Henderson.

164
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,130
Retirement can be a tough transition.

165
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,194
All right?

166
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,283
Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen.

167
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,320
Don't mix those sleeping
pills with alcohol

168
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,379
unless you want to kill yourself.

169
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,684
Okay. Who's next?

170
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,025
<i>And for those of you in the Southland,</i>

171
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,361

<i>another beautiful day with</i>

<i>bright, sunny skies</i>

173
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,332
<i>and temperatures into the mid-80s.</i>

174
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,269
<i>A perfect day for some golf.</i>

175
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,536
<i>And that's gonna continue</i>
<i>right into next week.</i>

176
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,510
<i>Gorgeous blue skies</i>
<i>and sensationally warm.</i>

177
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,740
<i>It doesn't get any
better than that.</i>

178
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,908
<i>This just in.</i>

179
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,712
<i>Soul music fans around the globe</i>

180

<i>of Marcus Hooks.</i>

181
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,053
<i>The legendary singer

182
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,489
<i>apparently suffered</i>
<i>a massive heart attack</i>

183

184
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,163

185
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,757

187
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,335
<i>The seven-time Grammy Award winner</i>

# <i>I'll do anything for you</i> #

190
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,641
<i>We're back in just a moment.</i>

191
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,375
Humh!

192
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,879
Kezian Motors. Can I help you?

193
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,208
Who?

194
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,154
Hinds, telephone!

195
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,896
Dealing drugs out of my garage?

196
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,092
Listen, you doing something illegal,

197
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll find out and send your ass
back to prison

198
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,403
so fucking fast, it will make
your black monkey head spin.

199
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,605
You know, there was a time

200
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,306
I would've knocked your teeth
down your throat

201
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,780
for saying some shit like that to me.

202
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,180
But I'm a changed man.

203
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,275
I'm trying to be
all centered and shit.

204
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,344
Now, I could'a called you
a unibrow-shaving, pilaf-eating,

205
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,219
greasy-ass goat fucker,
but I didn't, did I?

206
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,486
- Uh-uh.
- 'Cause I didn't want to hurt your feelings,

207
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,152
and I didn't want to piss you off,

208
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,458
just like I know
deep, deep down inside,

209
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,464
you don't want to piss me off, either.

210
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,464
- Now, do you?
- Uh-uh.

211
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,898
Uh-uh. No. Uh-uh.

212
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,094
All right.

213
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,864
Peace.

214
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,535
Scruffy, Kibbles...

215
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,166
Yeah, this is Louis.

216
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,040
Hey. Mr. Hinds.

217
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,409
It's Danny Epstein
calling from New York. How are you today?

218
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,777
<i>Who?</i>

219
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,780
Marty's son.

220
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,111
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

221
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,811
Shit,

222
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,683
I ain't seen you since
you were in diapers.

223
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,686
<i>Yeah. Well,</i>

224
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,687
I assume you heard

225
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,087
about Marcus' passing, yeah?

226
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,594
Oh, yeah. I'm crying the tears
of a motherfucking clown.

227
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,027
Okay. Here's the thing.
VH1 is putting together

228
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,860
a farewell tribute at the Apollo,

229
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,025
<i>and they got a lot of
big names lined up.</i>

230
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,092
And they want Henderson and Hinds
to perform, right?

231
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,638
That's right! The Real Deal
back together again.

232
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,003
<i>It's a great opportunity.</i>

233
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,598
You talk to Floyd?

234
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,142
<i>I did.</i>

235
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,700
Mr. Henderson is in.

236
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,710
<i>Good.</i>

237
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,178
Then I'm out.

238
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,517
# <i>Born under a bad sign</i> #

239
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,560
# <i>Been down since I began to crawl</i> #

240
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,732
# <i>If it wasn't for bad luck</i> #

241
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,999
# <i>You know I wouldn't have</i>
<i>no luck at all</i> #

242
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,143
# <i>Hard luck and trouble...</i> #

243
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,300
That is disgusting.

244
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,804
Ooh!

245
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,734
I don't believe this. Hmm.

246
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,176
Hey!

247
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,235
Uhh!

248
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,119
Ohh. Damn!

249
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,527
Ooh. Fuck happened, man?

250
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,760
Hell if I know. I came in,
found your ass laying there.

251
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,995
Bullshit.
You looked me dead in my eyes.

252
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,128
Man, you recognized me.

253
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,728
I didn't recognize you.
You done changed.

254
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,067
I come all the way down here,

255
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,574
and, man, you gonna
look me in my face

256
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,611
- and knock me the fuck out?
- Should've called first.

257
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,736
How the hell I'm gonna call

258
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:54,905
and you ain't got no phone?

259
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,948
What kind of person
ain't got no land phone?

260
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,813
Kind of person don't
want to get no calls.

261
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,374
You don't even know
why I came down

262
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,717
to this old fucked-up-the-ass
neighborhood.

263
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,279
I talked to little Ep.
I know why you're here.

264
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,723
And the answer is no.

265
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,785
Did he tell you we're at the Apollo
and they sold out?

266
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,797
Did he also tell you
who gonna be there?

267
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,891
Booker T. Jones. Isaac Hayes.
Bootsy Collins.

268
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,900
Shakira.

269
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,958
I don't care.

270
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,664
Do it for Marcus.

271
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,001
Fuck Marcus.

272
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,301
Well, do it for me.

273
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,274
- Fuck you!
- Come on, man.

274
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,935
- This is our shot.
- At what?

275
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,502
At a comeback, fool.
If we do this shit right,

276
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,811
we can get a record deal
and get back on the road

277
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,407
like we was 30 years ago.

278
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,214
I ain't trying to be like 30 years ago!

279
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,753
I ain't trying to make no comeback.

280
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,016
I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.

281
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,056
Don't make me beg you, man.

282
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:48,056
Lao-Tzu says, "Free from desire,
"you realize the mystery.

283
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,501
"Caught in desire,
you see only the manifestations."

284
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,161
What the fuck
that even mean, man?

285
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,867
That means...

286
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,177
get the fuck out.

287
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,780
Well, I guess you don't give a fuck
about the money, then, huh?

288
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,719
What money? It's a funeral!

289
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,054
Nobody get paid to sing
at no damn funeral!

290
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,525
How much?

291
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,959
40 grand.

292
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,690
Apiece?

293
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:19,958
No, down the middle.

294
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,058
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no!

295
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,363
That ain't even enough.

296
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,301
What the fuck you mean
that's not enough, man?

297
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,500
I got a lifestyle to maintain here.

298
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,167
What kind of lifestyle, man,

299
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,767
you filthy motherfucker?

300
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,541
You got a pantry full of dog food.
I don't see no dog.

301
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,138
Dog under the bed,
nigger! You lucky

302
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,979
he ain't attacked your ass
when you came in.

303
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,042
You're the dog, motherfucker!

304
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,122
Look, man, what happened to all
that fucking money you done saved, man?

305
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,422
Saved? Shit.

306
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,962
I don't remember shit from Watergate

307
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,554
to when the space shuttle blew up.

308
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,791
Hmm. Money I saved.

309
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,390
Okay, what about the royalties?
I used to get

310
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,230
over $30,000 a year off that shit.

311
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,067
I lost my royalties in a poker game.
All right?

312
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,369
- Poker?
- Listen here, man.

313
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,602
If you serious about un-assing me

314
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,645
from my lavish surroundings here,

315
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,612
man, you gonna have to be
a little more flexible

316
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,775
in your thinking. Say, oh...

317
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,875
60/40.

318
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,045
Man, you must be higher
than a motherfucker.

319
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,554
We always split shit
straight down the middle.

320
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,250
Ain't gonna be nothing to split

321
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,587
if I don't show up, now, is there?

322
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,958
And I ain't showing up
unless I get 60% of the proceeds.

323
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,257
You rich anyway, motherfucker.

324
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,129
I seen your little car wash
commercials on the TV.

325
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,998
I transferred all my business affairs
over to my nephew.

326
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,095
- I'm on a fixed income, man.
- So what?

327
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,072
So your drawers!

328
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,801
That's why that 20 damn
thousand dollars

329
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,810
- look good to me right now.
- 16!

330
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,779
That's your cut of a 60/40 split.

331
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,337
And those are my terms.

332
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,383
And they're non-negotiable.

333
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,213
55/45.

334
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,259
Fatherfuck you, man.

335
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,061
You're gonna tell me 60/40.

336
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,931
You don't dictate to me!

337
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,437
I'm Floyd motherfucking Henderson.

338
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,029
You and Marc, I made you

339
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,631
and that motherfucker!

340
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,905
You can't sing, hum,
or motherfucking skip.

341
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,309
Ain't that a bitch?

342
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,177
Skip on these motherfucking nuts!

343
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,783
You and Marcus, may you rest in shit.

344
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,547
Motherfucker.
I'm Floyd fucking Henderson,

345
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,815
you Apostle-faced motherfucker!

346
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,448
This motherfucker slams this door
in my face one more time...

347
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,118
I'm tired of this motherfucker!

348
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,560
Always had a problem with this bitch.

349
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,558
He ain't nothing. He's ignorant!

350
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,795
Motherfucker's just a idiot.

351
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,338
Chihuahua-head motherfucker, man,
sitting up there,

352
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,499
always want to tell
somebody what to damn do.

353
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,008
He gonna sit there and talk the fool?

354
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,910
Ooh, my blood pressure's
high, motherfucker.

355
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,072
Huh!

356
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,287
Don't let this motherfucker
get you like this.

357
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,113
Huhh!

358
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,655
What!

359
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,719
Stay!

360
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,338
First of all, I clearly want
to state this for the record.

361
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,534
And I find this arrangement we got,
man, despicable.

362
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,203
But I'm Floyd Henderson.
I'm a trouper.

363
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,679
And you know I'd do
any doggone thing, man,

364
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,579
to see this group get back on its feet,

365
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,515
'cause you know
that's the type of motherfucker I am.

366
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,052
But in the meantime,

367
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,749
I'm going back
to my $600-a-night hotel room,

368
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,588
and I'm gonna have me
a nice hot bubble bath

369
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,185
to wash some of this
filth and dirt and grime

370
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,322
from this black
fucking hole you live in.

371
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,835
Then I'm having me
a nice, juicy-ass steak, oh, yeah,

372
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,666
the size of your
motherfucking back.

373
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,833
Then I'm gonna take me
a shit shower and shave.

374
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,876
And I'll be here at 6 a.m.

375
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,411
to take you to the motherfucking
airport.

376
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,673
You got me? I don't fly.

377
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,975
And I get up at 8.

378
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,416
My cousin out the penitentiary,

379
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,317
I'm gonna have him kill
this motherfucker!

380
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,983
Man talk to me like
I'm a motherfucking kid.

381
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,184
I ain't no motherfucking kid.

382
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,591
Every time we... we start on the road,

383
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,425
he starts in saying the same shit.

384
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,895
Hey! Who's got my lunch?

385
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:15,899
Who are you?

386
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,026
I'm Phillip Newman, sir,

387
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,433
the new intern. You hired me,

388
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,698
like, 20 minutes ago.

389
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,239
Chuckles Newman's my uncle.

390
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,637
- He's the one that told you...
- Stop talking.

391
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,369
Very good. I already got a job for you.

392
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,001
Okay? Bing, bang, boom.
Look at that.

393
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,569
Yeah. Henderson and Hinds,
Marcus' old backup singers,

394
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,478
are being real dickheads
about this tribute thing...

395
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,744
Oh, my God! Henderson and Hinds!
The Real Deal.

396
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,410
They're the only band
that got to play three songs

397
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,885
on a sing episode of <i>Soul Train.</i>

398
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,616
Don Cornelius was there as a witness,
and I got it on VHS.

399
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,214
They don't do that here. All right?

400
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,953
- Yes, sir.
- This is a record label,

401
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,085
not a fan club.

402
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,130
I want those two old fucks
there on Saturday,

403
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,824
and I want you to make that happen.

404
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,831
Got it?

405
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,427
The Real Deal is back,
and they not gonna stop us now.

406
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,861
Uh-huh.

407
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,523
Ohh! Shit.

408
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,588
Ohh...

409
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,034
What the fuck is that, man?

410
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,502
This is a gun.

411
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,801
I never travel through Klan country
without one.

412
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,363
- You got a problem with that, pops?
- Yeah,

413
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,601
I got a problem with that, man.

414
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,075
The last time I saw that gun,

415
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,668
you were pointing at me,
and you were shooting it.

416
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,975
Listen here, Floyd.
We ain't two old friends

417
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,106
out for some Sunday drive

418
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,479
down Memory Lane. All right?

419
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,451
Fact is, I can hardly stand
the sight of your ass,

420
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,886
so you best not to provoke me.

421
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,082
Or what's gonna happen?

422
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,818
There's a lot of empty road

423
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,087
between here and where we trying to go.

424
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,287
Where a nigger could disappear

425
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,125
and where nobody'd
miss his black ass.

426
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,866
Well, let me see that gun.

427
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,660
Let me see it!

428
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,999
Be careful, fool.

429
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,040
You don't think I know
how to hold a gun, man?

430
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,699
I'm a member of the NRA, man.

431
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,402
Ohh!

432
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,570
where's... Now, what's... God damn it!

433
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,578
Oh! Shit!

434
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,977
- Damn!
- Ohh!

435
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,349
Drive! Drive!
God damn it it, drive!

436
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,386
- Ohh!
- Help me!

437
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,580
Aaahh!

438
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,883
Grab the wheel, fool!

439
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,084
- Look out!
- Now, turn! Turn!

440
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,094
Ohh!

441
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,960
What the hell is wrong with you!

442
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,862
Don't shoot no gun in a car!

443
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,697
You said... The safety
wasn't on there.

444
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,566
Safety, my ass!

445
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,037
Safety wasn't...

446
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,095
Ohh...

447
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,875
NRA!

448
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,877
Negro Retards' Association!

449
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,879
Dumb motherfucker.

450
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,007
What the fuck is that?

451
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,809
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

452
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,945
Been a long time
since we saw our name in lights.

453
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,680
What our name doing up in lights?

454
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,848
We're at the Apollo Theater
this weekend.

455
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,188
We ain't been on stage
in over 30 years.

456
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,852
Now, the last thing you want to do

457
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,555
is stink up the joint. Am I right?

458
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,291
And I got us free dinner to boot.

459
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,275
Man, we sure are lucky
I kept these threads.

460
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,867
Do we look good!

461
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,139
Better hope that button
don't pop off and kill nobody.

462
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,607
God damn, I wish these pants
weren't squeezing my nuts so tight.

463
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,515
Maybe it'll help you
hit those high notes.

464
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,146
I don't need help
hitting the high notes.

465
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,520
Yeah, right. We'll see. We'll see.

466
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,991
Ha ha! Busting out.

467
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,021
Ladies and gentlemen,

468
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,089
tonight, the Flagstaff Motor Inn

469
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,828
is proud to present
to you back onstage

470
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,063
for the first time
in nearly three decades

471
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,107
the unforgettable
sweet soul sounds of...

472
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,339
The Real Deal!

473
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,643
Whoo!

474
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,656
# Don't you ever #

475
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,356
# Be sad #

476
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,556
# Lean on me #

477
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,292
# When times are bad #

478
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,301
# When the day comes #

479
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,269
# And you are down #

480
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,465
# In a river of trouble #

481
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,508

# Just hold on #

00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,378
# I'm coming #

484
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,608
# Hold on #

485
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,877
# I'm coming #

486
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,217
# On my way #

487
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,221
# Your lover #

488
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,280
# When you be cold #

489
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,450
# I'll be your cover #

490
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,791
# Don't have to worry #

491
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,057
- # 'Cause I'm here #
- Yeah.

492
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,258
# No need to summon me there #

493
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,699
# 'Cause I'm here #

494
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:17,928
# Yea-ah #

495
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,732
# Hold on #

496
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,329
# I'm coming #

497
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,068
Yipes!

498
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,235
# I'm coming #

499
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,108
# Just hold on #

500
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,911
# I'm coming #

501
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,177
# Just hold on #

502
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,309
# I'm coming #

503
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,255
Look here. Reach out to me

504
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,690
for some satisfaction.

505
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,954
You know, Floyd, all she got to do

506
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,794
# Is call my name #

507
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,391
# For quick reaction #

508
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,061
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

509
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,104
# Yeah #

510
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,103
# Yeah #

511
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,104
Ooh! Aah!

512
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,435
Ooh!

513
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,635
Ooh! Ooh, ooh! Ooh!

514
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,041
Aaah!

515
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,271
Lou, Lou, you all right?
You all right?

516
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,079
I can't breathe!

517
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,380
Louis.

518
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,148
Ohh!
Keep going. Keep going.

519
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,154
I can't breathe.

520
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,790
Ladies and gentlemen,
please forgive us

521
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,922
for this technical difficulty.

522
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,397
Ow!

523
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,763
Aah!

524
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,665
Fucking eye, man!

525
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,761
I'm sorry, man.
I got on these tight slacks!

526
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,567
Well, then, I'll sue your fat ass!

527
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,607
You sue these nuts.

528
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,437
- Go on, get on outta here.
- Jesus!

529
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,670
Take it from the top.

530
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,143
How are we gonna
take it from the top?

531
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,577
- I'm revved up to go, man,
- You can't hardly breathe.

532
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,841
- You may need a chest X-ray.
- I'm good!

533
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,109
Is there a doctor in the house?

534
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,083
I love you, Debbie.

535
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,313
Get off me, Ernest T!

536
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,116
Lou. Lou. Lou. Calm down, man.

537
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,816
Ain't but 12 motherfuckers out here, man.

538
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,415
It's still a audience!

539
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,653
I don't care if it's two or three.
It's a audience.

540
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,820
That's what I'm talking about.

541
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,295
Your attitude is f'd up.

542
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,628
Same thing that messed us up
back in the day.

543
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,826
No. You know what fucked our shit up
back in the day?

544
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:57,834
No. I don't know.

545
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,268
Oh, you know goddamn well

546
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,599
What fucked our shit up back in the day.

547
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,333
- Oh, I do, huh?
- Yes, you do!

548
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,272
What fucked our shit up
back in the day

549
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:08,039
was you sticking your johnson
in my woman!

550
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,842
Ooh.

551
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

552
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,656
I'm Floyd Henderson.

553
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,356
This fool is Louis Hinds.

554
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,025
We are The Real Deal,
and that's for real.

555
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,469
I want to thank you for being
a super audience here tonight.

556
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,403
Motherfucker.

557
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,704
I'm sorry I hit you, Debbie. Come back.

558
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,301
Shut the fuck up,
or I'll knock your dick in the dirt.

559
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,710
Drunk son of a bitch.

560
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,941
Ohh...

561
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,520
# <i>Happy</i> #

562
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,488
Hey, Louis, are we gonna talk
about last night,

563
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,046
or we just gonna let it fester?

564
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,493
All right. Well, I was
a little rusty, okay?

565
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,155
That's a insult to rust, ain't it?

566
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,824
Well, what about you,
motherfucker?

567
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,630
Last night, look like you were
stuck in cement.

568
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,897
I had a hip replacement, Louis.

569
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,598
Well, you should've paid
a hundred more dollars

570
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,697
and got the deluxe model
with some rhythm in it.

571
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,605
'Cause that motherfucker you got,

572
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,769
- it ain't working.
- Oh, that's fine, man.

573
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,903
But that's not what we talking about.

574
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,538
I'm talking about Odetta.

575
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,607
Oh.

576
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,877
Louis, if I thought there was still

577
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,418
- gonna be a problem between us...
- You went

578
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,386
where you shouldn't have gone,

579
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,854
period!

580
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,049
Now, there's some shit

581
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,955
that's just etched in stone.

582
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,926
First and foremost is

583
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:34,398
thou shall not dig for diamonds
in another brother's mine!

584
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,196
Bullshit, man. You gotta take
some responsibility here.

585
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,361
You think she didn't know, man,

586
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,562
about all of your smoking

587
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:40,866
and drinking and drugs

588
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,406
and other women? She knew.

589
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,465
She came running to me
telling, "My man

590
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,535
Louis did this. Louis did that.
Hold me, Floyd."

591
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,943
All right, well, getting the pussy
is one thing.

592
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,447
- You ain't had to marry her.
- What?

593
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,914
You'd have to be a zip-down fool

594
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,644
to let her slide
through your fingers, man.

595
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,447
All right, well, if I'm a fool,
then you are, too.

596
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,284
You think I don't know that?
She hurt my heart, too.

597
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,917
Good!
That's a poor motherfucking comfort.

598
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:05,258
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

599
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,558
# <i>Every night I'm telling</i> #

00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,794
# <i>Whoopie</i> #

604
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:26,106
Well, how many times did you say
you was married after Odetta?

605
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,614
Four.

606
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,746
Ohh!

607
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:33,757
I married this girl named Estelle
to get over Odetta.

608
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,292
Then I married Henrietta.

609
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,555
She wasn't no good for me.

610
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,926
Then I married Josephine.

611
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,966
She definitely wasn't no good for me
because she met Carl.

612
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,024
All right. That's three.

613
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,797
Who was lucky number four?

614
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,701
Her name was Consuelo.

615
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,400
She left me and went back to Cuba.

616
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,467
Ha ha ha!
People actually go back to Cuba?

617
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,638
She said she'd rather
spend the rest of her life

618
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,046
under that dictatorship
than spend another night with me.

619
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,712
How 'bout you?
How come you never got married?

620
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,620
I almost hooked up
with this girl down in the Philippines,

621
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,679
in Manila.

622
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,891
- Wow.
- But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

623
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,055
Tagalog, and only English she knew

624
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,122
was, "Me love you
long time for two dollar."

625
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,394
Yeah, I wasn't no good
at relationships after Odetta.

626
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,769
You ever hear from her?

627
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,068
Who, Mai Mai?

628
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,073
No. Odetta.

629
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,133
Oh. No, man.

630
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,605
I heard from her, man.

631
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,147
It was sometime around Christmas.

632
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,082
You know, in that place
she was living in Tulsa. You know?

633
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,386
Fuck it.
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

634
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,081
What you doing?

635
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,885
- I saw a coyote.
- Whyn't you put that thing up

636
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,255
before somebody get hurt, man?

637
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,691
How come you think
I don't know how to handle

638
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,126
- no damn piece, man?
- Think?

639
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,687
I know.

640
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,733
Yeah?

641
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,132
Yeah, come fuck with me now, Louis.

642
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,669
Come on. You think I'm soft, huh?

643
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,729
Yeah.
I'll bust one in your ass.

644
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,399
Floyd, you keep fucking around,

645
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,306
I'm gonna stick that gun
so far up your ass,

646
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,208
you gonna taste gunpowder
every time you talk.

647
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,110
- Well, let me...
- Shit!

648
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,750
God damn it!

649
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,379
Louis, that was a accident. I swear.

650
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,549
I'm sweating. My hand's wet.

651
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,058
You all right?

652
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,593
You warm? You hot?

653
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,526
You dizzy? You light-headed?

654
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,894
Louis, I swear I would never want
to hurt you, man.

655
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,195
I thought about killing you,
but I'd never want to hurt you.

656
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,736
<i>All right. In our continuing
tribute to Marcus Hooks,</i>

657

I'll say this for him...

No doubt. No doubt.
Come on, help me... help me out.

1, 2, 3.

679
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:16,485

- Drop step.

690
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,466
Drop step?
You know I can't do that right now.

691
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,475
Go, Lou.

692
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,875

# Come on, children #

Come on, fiddler.

741
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,046
I knew you were
gonna try to take over.

742
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,723
Look at him.

Share the love, baby.

767
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,812
All right, all right.

768
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,649
You know you pulled
the Al Green up there, right?

769
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,416
No, I didn't, Lou. Don't start that...

770
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,615
we barely got offstage

771
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,352
when you ran your ass
back out there.

772
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,020
Look, an encore
is at the audience's discretion.

773
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,653
You're supposed to wait
till they ask for it.

774
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,425
- You know they wanted it.
- I don't care what they wanted.

775
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,261
That shit was unprofessional.

776
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,665
Man...

777
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,936
Say,

778
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,306
I'm starting to remember
why I love the road so much.

779
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,811
Yeah.

780
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,880
Mmm.

781
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,011
If my instincts serve me right,

782
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,147
you're about to find
yourself another room tonight.

783
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,056
You know those little blue pills
make you go blind, right?

784
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,094
Mmm, mmm.

785
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,087
Don't call me when you get
that four-hour erection.

786
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,689
Hey, now, baby girl.

787
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,297
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

788
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,238
Oh. Aah!

789
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,400
Yeah, give it to me.

790
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,468
Those little pills, give me strength.

791
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,705
A little strength.

792
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,680
Ugh!

793
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,011
I'm going to fuck your brains out.

794
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,847
Oh! Oh, you're heavy.

795
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,687
Uh,

796
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,884
what's wrong, baby?

797
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,221
Nothing.

798
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,592
I just, uh, you know, I...

799
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,858
I just never been with
someone like you before.

800
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,594
It's true what they say.
But let me tell you something.

801
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,034
Floyd Henderson gonna be
nice and gentle.

802
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,799
Your first taste of dark meat

803
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,704
gonna be smooth and sweet, trust me.

804
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:04,935
No, I didn't mean that.

805
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,307
It's just, uh, you know,

806
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,711
I've never been with someone so old.

807
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:11,942
Old?

808
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,610
You ain't no teen queen
your damn self.

809
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,550
Huh.

810
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,883
Come on, come on, come on.

811
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,547
Come on, mama. Come here, baby.

812
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,852
Baby, baby. Look here.

813
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,122
Let's take our decades
of sexual experience

814
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,890
and combine them for one night

815
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,760
of exploration and bliss,
can we do that?

816
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,027
I won't disappoint you.

817
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,898
I won't disappoint you.

818
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,233
All right.

819
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,364
That's what I'm talking about.

820
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,772
I want to suck one of them titties.

821
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,310
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
something to show you.

822
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,470
- Ooh.
- Ooh, hoo.

823
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,741
I'm so hot, I'm about to fuck myself.

824
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,006
Bite my lip off.

825
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,949
Oh. Look!

826
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,452
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

827
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,112
Tonight I ain't got no
control like that no more.

828
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,920
Now, I hope you don't
mind a little hair.

829
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,723
Baby, I found
my sexual awakening in the '60s.

830
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,323
Nothing I like better
than a big old fluffy...

831
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,762
Damn, girl.

832
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,771
That's a whole bunch of hair
you got down there.

833
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,807
Yeah, I call it the natural look.

834
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,173
You sick?

835
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,040
I know it's big.

836
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,704
You need a pick.

837
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,077
You want me to shave it?

838
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,311
We ain't got the time or
apparatus for that type of job.

839
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,113
Okay, disregard.

840
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,312
Oh!

841
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,547
- Oh!
- Oh!

842
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,147
Look who's coming to dinner.

843
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,056
Right on time, ain't it?

844
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,560
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

845
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,289
Oh.

846
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,421
You know what I'm
gonna do for you?

847
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,897
What you fixing to do?

848
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,831
You ever had a velveteen rub?

849
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,267
A velveteen rub.

850
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,737
Ain't...
Ain't no cheese involved, is there?

851
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,706
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

852
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,108
Oh, yeah.

853
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,053
Ooh!

854
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,684
You're choking my chicken!

855
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,032
Ugh!

856
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,440
Ugh.

857
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,478
That's quite a show you got going

858
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,514
under the big top there, Sparky.

859
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,048
I had to take another
one of them damn pills

860
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,344
in the middle of the night, man.

861
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,385
This woman insatiable, man.
I'm shooting dust.

862
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,353
Oh, Floyd.

863
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,548
I'm right here, baby.

864
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:33,783
You ready for some more?

865
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,882
Yeah, come here.

866
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,357
Come here.

867
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,657
Come here.

868
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,754
Hi.

869
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,527
Think about that, boy.

870
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,660
There's my stallion.

871
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:46,998
Huh?

872
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,732
- I missed you.
- Oh, you missed me?

873
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:49,898
Mmm-hmm.

874
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,942
Mmm. You need a little air
on this thing.

875
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,102
Yeah.

876
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,373
Oh, you bad boy.

877
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,074
God damn.

878
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,707
You like that, huh?

879
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,376
I'm your little kitty cat.

880
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,755
Chastity?

881
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:07,746
Mama?

882
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:08,985
Mama?

883
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,288
You little whore.

884
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,828
You're one to talk.

885
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,296
Oh, did you take out
your teeth for him?

886
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,356
You watch how you talk to your mama.

887
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,026
Please, you can't
talk to me like that.

888
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,160
You're not my daddy.

889
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,261
That's right, who's your daddy?

890
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,464
- You're my daddy.
- Your big daddy.

891
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,330
Rosalee, are you in there?

892
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,933
Actually, that's my daddy.

893
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,205
Oh.

894
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,640
What are you thinking, Mama?

895
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,740
You ruined everything.

896
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,876
- I hate you.
- You little brat.

897
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,045
You're a dirty... all right, I love you.

898
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,645
- Mmm.
- Call me a lot of times.

899
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,021
Mama, what is wrong with you?

900
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,322
- I renounce you. You're a whore.
- Aah!

901
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,157
- I'm a whore?
- Yeah.

902
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,754
You just shamed the whole family,
you and the black man.

903
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,465
Whoa!

904
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,401
Whoo! That was fun.

905
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,305
# <i>So come, take me by the hand</i> #

906
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,316
# <i>We'll leave this troubled land</i> #

907
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,942
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- # <i>I know we can</i> #

908
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,247
# <i>I know we can</i> #

909
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,514
I'll be damned, man.

910
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,351
Them broads stole our money, man.

911
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,913
Whoo, yeah,

912
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,391
but they earned it.

913
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,023
Hello.

914
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,563
<i>Yeah, man.</i>
<i>It's Floyd Henderson, man.</i>

915
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,791
<i>We got a situation.</i>

916
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,958
What's the problem?

917
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,626
Well, my ex-partner,

918
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,169
the degenerate that he is, man,

919
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,297
got some trailer trash hos,
man, rip us off.

920
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,034
<i>Oh, wow, I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

921
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,405
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

922
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,467
Yeah, there's something
you can do. We need money.

923
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,637
<i>If we don't get no money,</i>

924
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,180
<i>we ain't gonna make it to the Apollo.</i>

925
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,546
I'm not sure what the procedure
for that would be.

926
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,744
I mean, there's just
a lot of red tape here.

927
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,252
You know, uh...

928
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,346
I'm going to have to get back to you.

929
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,017
- You do that. Get back with me now.
<i>- Mr. Henderson...</i>

930
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,061
we ain't gonna get very far
on ten gallons of gas,

931
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,494
I can tell you that.

932
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,327
I know where we can
get some money.

933
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,661
I know how to get some money.

934
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:07,067
# <i>Ain't no love, ain't no love</i> #

935
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,908
# <i>Like my baby's love</i> #

936
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,346

# <i>Ain't no lonely</i> #

939
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,055
Ooh, shit. What the hell is...

940
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:26,529
# <i>'Cause I ain't never,</i>
<i>never found me a girl</i> #

941
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,929
Oh, hell, no. You didn't.

942
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,728
Yes, I did.

943
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,792
- # <i>To love me like</i> #
- # <i>I do</i> #

944
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,202
# <i>Oh, yeah</i> #

945
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,330
Hey.

946
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,136
Hey, hey, you're...
what is wrong with you?

947
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,938
Don't be grabbing on me like that now.

948
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,444
I will knock your ass out
before I let you go ring that doorbell.

949
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,946
Come on, get up
on me, man. Come on.

950
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,743
You really want this? Huh?

951
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,545
- Huh?
- Come on... Oh! God damn.

952
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,710
- Oh, man. Come on...
- What?

953
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,185
- Oh!
- What's wrong, what?

954
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,380
I got a pain in my chest, man.

955
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,979
Come on, man.
Stop fucking with me.

956
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,081
Look like I'm fucking with you, man?

957
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,250
Come on, man, do me a favor.

958
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,816
Get my heart medicine
out of my bag.

959
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,987
- You got some heart med...
- Oh! Come on, look.

960
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,327
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

961
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,596
Hold on, man!

962
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,494
God damn, you got enough stuff in here
to start a drug store!

963
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,971
What it say on the bottle?

964
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,338
Sucker, motherfucker.

965
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,247
I'm gonna get your ass for this.

966
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,477
I'll leave the light on for you.

967
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,948
What up, dawg?

968
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,822
Um...

969
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,918
We're friends of, uh, Odetta's.

970
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,486
- Odetta?
- Yeah, is she in?

971
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,259
No, she ain't here, man.

972
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,596
Is she coming back?

973
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:38,862
Seriously doubt it.

974
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,099
Not unless we fitting to have
a zombie attack or some shit.

975
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,107
Eee!

976
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,369
What's up, Fu Manchu?

977
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,308
- Cleo!
- Yeah?

978
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,640
Get your ass out here!

979
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,044
Two old niggers
looking for your mama.

980
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,807
Come on in, man.
You're letting the heat out.

981
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,012
Mama?

982
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,145
Cold outside.

983
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,883
Your arthritis gonna kick up.

984
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,190
Who's that?

985
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,752
I don't know.

986
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,994
Yeah?

987
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,697
Uh, how you doing, ma'am?

988
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,137
My name is Floyd Henderson.
This is my...

989
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,072
I know who you are.

990
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,803
Guess you didn't hear
about the funeral.

991
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,641
Funeral? Odetta...

992
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:23,805
When did she pass?

993
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,008
Well, she got sick right after Christmas.

994
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,018
After that, it went pretty fast.

995
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,179
So why'd you come to see her?

996
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,415
What, she owe you
money or something?

997
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,720
- Oh, no.
- We just in the neighborhood.

998
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,260
Cleo, I can't find the bologna!

999
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,091
I'll be there in a minute!

1000
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,892
Hurry up!

1001
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:45,425
Well, if my mama wasn't dead,
I'd tell her you stopped by.

1002
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,765
Cleo!

1003
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,863
- Just hold on a second.
- C-L-E-O!

1004
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,964
- What the hell you want?
- I'm sorry...

1005
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,303
I told you this was
a bad idea to come here.

1006
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,673
Come on, man. Don't go there.

1007
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,768
Let's just go, okay?

1008
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,869
How old you think she is?

1009
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,345
27, 28?

1010
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,245
I don't know how old she is,
and I don't care. Let's go.

1011
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,476
Chillax, let me see something.

1012
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,916
What are you doing?

1013
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,181
Floyd, what the hell
are you looking for?

1014
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,381
Damn it.

1015
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,753
I'm just confirming a suspicion.

1016
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,382
That's all I'm doing.

1017
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,587
September 14, 1981. Bingo.

1018
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,892
It kind of works itself out, don't it?

1019
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,158
Put it back.

1020
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,027
Listen.

1021
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,501
Odetta left me, man,

1022
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,198
Thanksgiving Day, man, 1980.

1023
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,264
- So?
- So you do the math, motherfucker.

1024
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,901
Do the math? Nigga, please...

1025
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,410
Oh, shit. You hear that?

1026
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,673
Hear what?

1027
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,409
Listen, that bass line, right there.

1028
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,644
Hmm?

1029
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,447
Son of a bitch.

1030
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,885
# Oh, my name is Lester,
the Court Jester #

1031
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,925
# All you other rap niggas
done messed up #

1032
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,482
# I take you to school a semester #

1033
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,051
# Take you to court and sequester #

1034
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,063
- Yeah!
- # I'm judge and the jury #

1035
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,826
Bruce Lee, <i>Fists of Fury.</i>

1036
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,094
# You want to whip me,
the L-E-S-T-E-R #

1037
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,801
# Grab my girl by the waist #

1038
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,168
# Slap my girl in the face #

1039
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,434
# When my mama died,
I moved inside her crib #

1040
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,306
Hey, hey. Les, Les.

1041
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,277
Hey, man, what you doing in here?

1042
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,507
We're here trying to make some music.

1043
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,073
That what y'all doing?

1044
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,345
I don't see no musicians.

1045
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,785
Listen, you know who played the base line

1046
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,516
on that stuff you got running
under those so-called lyrics?

1047
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,219
My man, right there.

1048
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,992
Yeah, right, man.

1049
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,590
He ain't no damn instrumentator.

1050
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,293
Hey, yo, Big L, check it out, man.
It's them, man.

1051
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,562
They ain't bullshitting.

1052
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,898
Let me see this here.

1053
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,269
The Real Deal, huh?

1054
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,036
Hey, I mean, so what if we
jacked your shit, man? Huh?

1055
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,543
Good artists borrow,

1056
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,443
great artists steal, man.

1057
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,981
- You know who said that?
- Pablo Picasso.

1058
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,177
But literary scholars sometimes
like to attribute it to T.S. Eliot.

1059
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,653
Hell, no. It wasn't no damn
Missy Elliot, man.

1060
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,953
No, man, it was Bay Bay and them.

1061
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,151
Bay Bay, yup.

1062
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,524
That was Bay Bay,
for sure, hey, Bay Bay.

1063
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,619
Look, man.

1064
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,357
You know what? I'm sorry.

1065
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,490
I shouldn't have sampled
your music without permission.

1066
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,831
Why don't we all do a song together?

1067
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,370
a song called "Fuck You
and Your Bass Line."

1068
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,201
That's what I feel about it.

1069
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,207
Here what I think
about your damn bassline.

1070
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,869
Henderson and Hinds!

1071
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:08,969
Take that shit with you.

1072
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,638
Gold-faced motherfucker.

1073
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:11,840
I made that shit gangster,
that's what I did.

1074
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,314
Let me tell you something,
man, you...

1075
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,511
Hey! Stop it!

1076
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,383
Stop it!

1077
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,151
Hey! This is my house.
You hear me?

1078
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,590
I don't need this shit right now.

1079
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,719
You gonna talk to me crazy
in front of my boys?

1080
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,025
Why you still talking?
Shut the fuck up!

1081
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,497
Pay-Pay and Zig-Zig,

1082
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,591
let's dip, man.

1083
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,469
Bye, old niggers.

1084
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:39,031
Feel free to utilize
my facilities while you're here

1085
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,406
to make yourself another hit.

1086
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,913
I know you ain't had a hit
since Ike hit Tina.

1087
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:44,948
Get out of here.

1088
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,075
# Get the fuck #

1089
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,416
# Out my grill #

1090
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,887
# 'Fore you get killed #

1091
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,652
My name is Lester the Court Jester.

1092
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,593
What a disrespectful son of a bitch.

1093
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,062
- Just lay off.
- Just lay off?

1094
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,758
I know your mama taught you better.

1095
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,300
Odetta would've
whooped his damn ass.

1096
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,700
The fuck you know about
what my mama would've done.

1097
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,102
Were you here when she was
dying of that cancer?

1098
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,607
I don't think so. I think Lester was.
The hell you know.

1099
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,937
You're right. I don't know nothing.

1100
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,409
That's right, he don't know shit.

1101
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,241
No, he don't.

1102
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,111
Now I'm going to go change
and get dinner started

1103
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,775
because you guys
are staying, right?

1104
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:21,977
Oh, no. We need to hit the road.

1105
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,111
Yes, ma'am. We are staying.

1106
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,452
Okay, then.

1107
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,090
Hell, it's what Mama would've wanted.

1108
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,255
Oh, yeah. That's Odetta's
child, all right.

1109
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:45,104
Okay, I put some sheets on the bed
in the guest room for you guys.

1110
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,405
Thank you.

1111
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,605
That's Carla Thomas, right?

1112
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,274
Sure is. Your mother's favorite.

1113
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:57,044
So how come you guys only
put out that one album?

1114
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,990
Well, when we wasn't
fighting over your mother,

1115
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,320
we had a problem
in our record sales.

1116
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,360
Yeah, as in we didn't sell any.

1117
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,588
Okay.

1118
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,528
Well, you'd never know it wasn't a hit,

1119
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,626
as much as Mama played it.

1120
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,541
About 100 degrees, and you
got a leather jacket on.

1121
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,873
Appreciate it, Sam.

1122
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,608
She said,

1123
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,343
being on the road with y'all

1124
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,682
was some of the best times of her life.

1125
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:34,383
Oh, good days. Good days.

1126
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,052
I wish I could've seen that.

1127
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:41,359
Say, why don't you
come to Memphis with us?

1128
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,558
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

1129
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,568
- What?
- We got a gig.

1130
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,728
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Floyd, Floyd.

1131
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,896
The girl got a life.

1132
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,063
She ain't got time to be ripping,

1133
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,572
running up and down the road
with two old niggers.

1134
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,108
Why not?

1135
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,736
Memphis is fun.
We always have fun in Memphis.

1136
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,904
You'll enjoy it. Trust me.

1137
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,608
Fun? Look like I got time for fun?

1138
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:01,944
Nah.

1139
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,694
Hey, Louis.

1140
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,822
You know, Cleo was telling me

1141
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,923
that Odetta never told her nothing
about her father,

1142
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,264
not even his name.

1143
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,099
But she did say
he was a musician.

1144
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,695
You ain't said nothing stupid
to the girl, have you?

1145
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:23,865
Like what?

1146
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,739
Oh, like, uh,

1147
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,038
Cleo, you know, I'm your daddy.

1148
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,773
Well, I'm still
feeling out the situation.

1149
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,110
What the fuck was that

1150
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,809
that "You ought to come
to Memphis with us" shit?

1151
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:37,217
Now that, right there,
that's a recipe for disaster.

1152
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,552
Louis, Louis, I know
this ain't easy for you.

1153
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,092
But I never thought I'd have a child.

1154
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,957
Now I'm part of this big
old circle called life.

1155
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:50,022
A piece of Floyd Henderson,
man, might be here to live on,

1156
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,533
and maybe forever.

1157
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,467
If you don't shut up
and go to sleep,

1158
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,904
a big piece of Floyd Henderson ass
might not wake up in the morning.

1159
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,737
Oh, Louis, Louis.

1160
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,367
I respect the fact that you want

1161
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,844
to cloak your pain with your anger.

1162
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,112
Good night.

1163
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,745
Good night.

1164
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,562
Oh, hey! What the fuck is that?

1165
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,689
What's wrong?

1166
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,357
You been taking
them dick pills again?

1167
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,799
I though it was my cholesterol meds,
I swear I did.

1168
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,133
You can't be spooning
with a motherfucker with that!

1169
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,365
What's wrong with you?

1170
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,964
- Uh, I...
- Nasty son of a bitch!

1171
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,532
Give me some covers.
I'm gonna sleep on the floor.

1172
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,668
Shit.

1173
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,269
Go on, then. Sleep on the floor.

1174
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,404
Nobody wants you, Louis.

1175
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,381
I don't like boy pussy no way.

1176
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,916
I hope your back hurt
like a motherfucker.

1177
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,418
Better my back than my asshole.

1178
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,580
Nasty... I'll beat
your motherfucking...

1179
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,556
All them years I spent in prison,

1180
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,558
ain't nobody roll up on me like that.

1181
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,218
I was going to ask you about that.

1182
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,593
You ought to be ashamed
of your goddamn self,

1183
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,097
nasty son of a bitch.

1184
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,841
# Like I never had #

1185
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,595
# When I'm feeling bad #

1186
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,291
# Come on and comfort me #

1187
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,097
# Oh, baby, you know the way #

1188
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,934
# I showed you how to love me right #

1189
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:41,706
# So comfort me tonight #

1190
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:46,181
# Come on and comfort me, honey #

1191
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:53,556
# You know the way, baby #

1192
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,615
# 'Cause I showed you right #

1193
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:03,429
# I want it, I want it #

1194
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,765
# Why don't you #

1195
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,900
# Comfort me? #

1196
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,622
Floyd!

1197
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,393
Yo.

1198
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,729
<i>Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson?</i>

1199
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:39,962
No, this is Louis.

1200
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,698
Mr. Hinds.

1201
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,501
It's Phillip Newman
of FC Management.

1202
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,234
How are you, man? I'm a huge fan.

1203
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,741
So?

1204
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,005
So...

1205
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,106
I think I've solved your
cash flow problems, my man.

1206
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,651
I've withdrawn $10,000

1207
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,209
from my old parents' savings account

1208
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,448
to tide you over until
things get sorted out.

1209
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,751
Who'd you say you was again?

1210
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:01,916
<i>Phillip.</i>

1211
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,516
I wrote you letters
when the man had you

1212
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,390
locked down in the pen, you know?

1213
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,828
I know you're innocent.
Shit ain't right.

1214
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,801
Okay, Phillip, um, look here.

1215
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:12,892
We're on our way to Memphis.

1216
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,028
Um, why don't you meet us

1217
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,336
at, um, the fountain at Peabody Hotel,

1218
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,706
<i>5:00?</i>

1219
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:23,644
Memphis. All right!

1220
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,373
I'm hungrier than a mo...

1221
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,884
There you are, girl.
You make up your mind?

1222
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,442
You want to go to Memphis
with us, or not?

1223
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,078
What you gonna do?

1224
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,350
What happened?

1225
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,692
Nothing. Nothing happened.

1226
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,931
Nothing happened.

1227
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,266
- No.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1228
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,826
Let him get his whupping.

1229
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,339
Why you hit her?

1230
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,818
The hell you gonna
do about it, man?

1231
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,684
I'm the nigger with the gun, man.

1232
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,847
Oh, shit.

1233
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,687
Damn! Ugh!

1234
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:10,851
- Aah!
- Come on.

1235
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:14,658
Get your albino
Ike Turner ass up, uh-huh.

1236
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:15,993
Come on.

1237
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,160
Aah! Okay! Oh, shit! Aah!

1238
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,760
My follicles, man!

1239
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,806
Look her in the eye and say
"I'm sorry I hit you,

1240
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,364
and I'm never gonna put
my hands on you again."

1241
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,070
- My bad, baby. I ain't...
- Say what I told you to say!

1242
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,477
I'm sorry I hit you.
I ain't never gonna do it again.

1243
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,107
Now, say you're sorry
for sampling my bass line

1244
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,378
and for stomping
on my partner's record.

1245
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,046
I'm sorry for sampling your bass line

1246
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,783
- and stomping on your Real Deal record.
- Okay.

1247
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,688
Now, we taking a road trip,
and we need some gas money.

1248
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,522
I ain't got no money, man!

1249
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,028
Can you help us?
I saw you out there selling that shit.

1250
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,724
It's weed, it ain't crack man!
I ain't got...

1251
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,629
- Give me the money!
- Okay, okay.

1252
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,962
There's money in my shorts...

1253
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,525
Ain't nobody reaching
in your drawers, get it out!

1254
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,230
Okay, okay.

1255
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,672
I got to reach around my meat, man.

1256
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,977
- Here.
- Take it.

1257
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,740
Take it.

1258
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,942
Oh, damn. My hair hurts.

1259
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,609
Take it, man! Aah!

1260
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,617
Ow! You're breaking my arm!

1261
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,983
Oh, hush.

1262
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,079
That's just a little
Chinese submission hold.

1263
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,454
This is what it feels like
when I break your arm.

1264
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,760
- Shit!
- Break his arm.

1265
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,319
Oh, bastard!

1266
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,491
I know motherfuckers like you, Lester.

1267
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,797
Used to see them
in the yard every day.

1268
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,032
You'd better hope
you don't never go inside

1269
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,563
because you,
you straight up bitch material.

1270
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,041
What about my car, man?

1271
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,236
What about your car?

1272
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,280
Oh, shit.

1273
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,473
I ain't got no clothes on.

1274
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,913
This is bullshit.

1275
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,712
So what? You run around
with your drawers

1276
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,150
hanging off your ass anyway.

1277
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,347
I wasn't really gonna shoot you!

1278
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,514
Get the fuck out of here.

1279
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,581
See, I'm the nigger
with the gun now.

1280
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,649
You better hope my arm
don't get better.

1281
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,922
I'm gonna learn karate
and kick your ass!

1282
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,463
Fuck you!

1283
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,333
It was a good thing you stepped in

1284
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,959
when you did what you did, partner,

1285
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,469
because if I'd have
got a piece of him,

1286
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,234
I'd have fucked his shit up
entirely, and you know that.

1287
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:05,569
Come on.

1288
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,439
I'm too old to be tussling
with the motherf...

1289
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,535
I'd have shot him. I'd have popped...

1290
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:12,138
I'm six, seven years older.
I'd have, like, tussled...

1291
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,514

Oh, my God.

1315
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,173
Mr. Henderson, Mr. Hinds,

1316
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,473
let me just start off by saying...

1317
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:17,843
Thank you.

1318
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,147
What's up?

1319
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,949
Phillip, tonight we're
playing at the House of Soul.

1320
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,353
Make sure you be there, baby.

1321
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,359
Right on.

1322
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,123
Hello. welcome to the Peabody.
How can I help you?

1323
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,630
You can help me by giving me

1324
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,360
three of your best
doggone suites, baby.

1325
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,369
Well, it'll be my pleasure
to assist you today.

1326
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,563
May I see some identification, please?

1327
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:42,798
Okay.

1328
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,305
Right there.

1329
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,864
Go to hell, Louis.

1330
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,911
Mr. Henderson?

1331
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,445
It is I.

1332
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,813
Will you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

1333
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,048
Okay.

1334
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,484
Henderson.

1335
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,723
Ahh, I-I'm sorry,
Mr. Henderson, Henderson.

1336
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,593
We're unable to accommodate you.

1337
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,690
Perhaps we could
recommend another hotel.

1338
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,359
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

1339
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,766
I want to stay at the Peabody.

1340
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:16,397
Yes, sir, I understand
you've stayed with us before,

1341
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,872
and apparently,
that's the problem.

1342
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,205
It seems that the last time
you stayed here...

1343
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,439
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

1344
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,482
you hosted a party,
during which the room

1345
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,414
and several other areas of the hotel

1346
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,817
- sustained extensive damage.
- Uh-oh.

1347
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,048
I don't recollect nothing like that.

1348
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,988
I think that's the night
Sly and Bootsy

1349
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,616
came by with the fire-eater.

1350
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,025
Is that the one with the snake?

1351
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,029
- That's the one.
- Hmm.

1352
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,760
Perhaps you could put those rooms
in the name of Louis Hinds.

1353
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,096
Yeah, perhaps.

1354
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,194
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

1355
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,612
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

1356
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,409
What's on there?
Let me see that shit.

1357
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,609
I want to see what's on there.

1358
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,482
I need four rooms, Don.

1359
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,488
Your best available.

1360
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,062
Oh, hey, guys.

1361
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,233
Your tailor gave me
several choices for tonight.

1362
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,277
He said he's going
to stop by around 7:30.

1363
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,402
What the fuck?

1364
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,174
Did you catch the sale
over at the Build-A-Pimp?

1365
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,408
You like that? It's fly, huh?

1366
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,111
It's a get-down, get-down.
It's live. It's funky.

1367
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,778
And I think I'm going
to get some poonanny.

1368
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,344
To be honest with you,

1369
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,788
I haven't been laid
since <i>Friends</i> was on television.

1370
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,120
So this is my night.

1371
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,753
You sure that ain't
one of your children?

1372
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:49,793
You gonna sing real nice tonight.

1373
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:51,026
Who's the girl singer?

1374
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,962
Oh, my goodness!
Look at here! Oh, man.

1375
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,167
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

1376
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,334
You good, man?

1377
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:08,609
Hey, good-looking.

1378
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,176
Claudette.
How you doing, girl?

1379
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,812
I know you still ain't upset

1380
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,186
about what happened
in Baltimore that...

1381
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,282
Oh! What's wrong
with you, woman?

1382
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,759
You going straight to hell,
Floyd Henderson.

1383
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,558
What you laughing at?

1384
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,498
- You want some, too?
- No.

1385
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,534
Fuck you.

1386
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,160
Eee.

1387
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,898
# Fuck you, fuck you #

1388
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,633
Now we have no girl singer.

1389
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,641
We just got to find
a replacement, that's all.

1390
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,869
It's too late.

1391
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,173
Cleo.

1392
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,043
You know all our songs, right?

1393
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,015
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

1394
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,745
but I'm not playing
with no rank amateur.

1395
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,151
Come on, Wolfman,
this ain't no rank amateur, man.

1396
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,882
This Odetta Whitfield's daughter, man.

1397
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,082
Ain't got to recognize.

1398
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,648
Shit. Let's roll, then, baby.

1399
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,319
Yeah.

1400
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,193
She can sing, can't she?

1401
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:57,955
Ow!

1402
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,635
Ow!

1403
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:06,306
Oh, oh!

1404
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,434
Here we go.

1405
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,208
Oh, yeah.

1406
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:18,919
# If music makes you move #

1407
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,354
# You can really groove #

1408
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:24,518
# Groove on #

1409
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,893
# Groove on #

1410
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:31,195
# If you feel like
you want to make love #

1411
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,997
# Under the stars above #

1412
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,004

00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,568
# Love on #

1414
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,576
# If there's something
that you wanna say #

1415
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,672
# And talking is the hard way #

1416
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,445
# Rap on #

1417
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,615
# Rap on #

1418
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,921
# 'Cause whatever #

1419
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,688
# You want to do #

1420
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,197
- # Ow #
- # You got to do your thing #

1421
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,162
# If you feel like
you want to scream #

1422
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,340
# If that's your way you let off steam #

1423
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,898
# Scream on #

1424
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:18,012
# Scream on #

1425
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,273
# If you feel like you want to sing #

1426
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,185
# 'Cause singing is your thing #

1427
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,222
# Sing on #

1428
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:32,220
# Sing on #

1429

# If you want to make love all night #

1430
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,695
# 'Cause you feel it's right #

1431
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,599
- # Right on #
- Oh, yeah, girl.

1432
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,798
# Right on #

1433
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,809
# 'Cause whatever #

1434
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,812

01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,871
# You got to do your thing #

1436
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,387
I'm with the band.
Yeah, it's a dream.

1437
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,452
Yeah, it's a... it's a total dream.

1438
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,622
Yeah.

1439
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:11,064
I play the harmuffica.

1440
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,034
# Wa, wa #

1441
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,229
# Wa, wa #

1442
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,566
I'll save you a seat.

1443
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,870
# 'Cause whatever #

1444
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:23,139
# You want to do #

1445
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:27,581
# Yeah, baby, oh #

1446
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:33,316
# You got to do your thing #

1447
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,584
# Yeah #

1448
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,596
Yeah.

1449
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:56,202
This is the most insane
night of my life.

1450
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,076
You know Isaac wants
to put me in his studio?

1451
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,480
He says he's got a song
that'd be perfect for me.

1452
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,519
Oh, he does, does he?

1453
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,885
Uh... Come on, now. It ain't like that.

1454
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:08,719
Oh, it's always like that,

1455
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,281
like movies.

1456
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,228
Well, I'll be careful.

1457
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,027
Just trying to look out
for you, that's all.

1458
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:22,232
Thanks, guys, for everything.

1459
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:28,408
# You got to do your thing, hey #

1460
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,946
See you later.

1461
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,344
# If you feel like making love #

1462
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,913
# 'Cause that's your thing #

1463
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,687
# Right on #

1464
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,161
Man, ain't that the Real Deal car?

1465
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,357
Sure is, homie. You a fan?

1466
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:54,968
Hell, yeah. I'm a big fan.

1467
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,561
You know where they at?

1468
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,072
'Cause I need to holler at 'em.

1469
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:01,577
Actually, I'm their manager.

1470
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,909
Really? Their manager?

1471
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,484
Hold on a minute.

1472
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:16,882
- Oh, hi, Floyd.
- Hey.

1473
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,018
Come on in.
Check this place out.

1474
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,323
I could get used to this.

1475
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,761
I'll bet you could.

1476
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:22,991
Let me get you a drink.

1477
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,191
Yeah, I'll take one.

1478
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,529
But hold on, before you do that,

1479
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,193
there's something
I want to say to you.

1480
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,170
It's been a blast connecting with you.

1481
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,500
I want you to know that.

1482
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,006
That's sweet of you.

1483
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,336
And if you need anything,

1484
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:34,603
like money or something like that,

1485
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:37,441
don't you hesitate to call me now.

1486
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,572
Not that money gonna make up
for the lost time between us

1487
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,116
or nothing like that.

1488
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,446
Lost time?

1489
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:43,542
You have to understand,

1490
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,713
Odetta never told me
nothing about you.

1491
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,552
Had I known about you
from the beginning,

1492
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:49,886
- I'd have been here from the start.
- Whoa, whoa.

1493
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,221
- Floyd...
- She never said nothing to me about you.

1494
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,556
You're not my father, Floyd.

1495
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,061
You're not listening.

1496
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,722
See, the thing you...
what's that? Say what?

1497
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:57,356
You're not my father.

1498
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,162
I-I'm not?

1499
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,532
No.

1500
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,195
How do you know?

1501
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,569
Because he knows who I am

1502
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,130
Or he did.

1503
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:07,471
I mean, for all I know,

1504
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:08,771
he could be dead.

1505
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,182
I get a little money from him
every once in a while.

1506
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,979
It's a blind trust he set up years ago.

1507
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,179
Something to do
with his music royalties.

1508
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,984
Music royalties?

1509
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,757
Oh!

1510
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,728
You knocked up my wife, motherfucker.

1511
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,925
Ooh. You stole her from me first.

1512
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,865
What is wrong with you?

1513
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,459
Whoo!

1514
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,868
You lost your...

1515
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,371
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

1516
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,873
No, I didn't tell her.

1517
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:40,272
I should've told her, though.

1518
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,607
I'll bet you laughing
your ass off, wasn't you?

1519
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,145
Going around, talking
about I'm the girl's daddy

1520
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,046
and big round circle of life,
all that bullshit.

1521
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:48,549
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

1522
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,279
Well, just a little bit.

1523
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,552
Floyd...

1524
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,386
Look, Floyd...

1525
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,652
Floyd, put it down. Put it down!

1526
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,320
Dawg, come on!

1527
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,987
You need to quit before you get hurt.

1528
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,055
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

1529
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,157
Ugh!

1530
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,667
Look, Floyd,

1531
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,670
I didn't mean for it
to happen, all right?

1532
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,035
You know how she was.

1533
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,164
Come here.

1534
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,435
Come here.

1535
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:15,067
Come on, man. Stop acting a fool.

1536
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,537
You all right?

1537
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,547
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

1538
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:25,946
Fucking dad!

1539
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,582
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1540
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,675
Time out.

1541
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,976
Time out.

1542
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,643
Oh.

1543
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,184
Still got a little pop
in your punch there, partner.

1544
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,382
Pop this, motherfucker!

1545
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,220
Oh!

1546
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,623
Ooh.

1547
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,628
Shit. Ugh.

1548
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:07,958
You dirty motherfucker,

1549
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,930
hitting me in the nuts.

1550
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:12,297
Ooh! Shit.

1551
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:16,236
Louis, you just can't
keep whooping on my ass.

1552
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,398
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

1553
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:19,998
I'm a motherfucking man.

1554
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:26,206
Louis, how come you won't
see your own daughter?

1555
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,273
Oh, motherfucker,
I wanted to see her,

1556
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,842
but, you know...

1557
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,821
It's time... After a while,

1558
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,915
you know, it's just...
it's just too much.

1559
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,756
Why didn't O tell her?

1560
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,420
Why didn't Odetta tell her, man?

1561
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,430
What was she going to tell her, huh?

1562
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:46,195
That her daddy was
a alcoholic dopehead convict

1563
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,600
that fucked up everything
he touched, hmm?

1564
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,763
No, no.

1565
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,670
She was better off without me.

1566
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,208
Oh, shit.

1567
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:54,333
Anyhow, it's too late now.

1568
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,434
Uh-uh.

1569
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,002
It was a mistake
getting to know her.

1570
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,741
- Lou...
- What?

1571
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,180
What is wrong with you?
You having a seizure?

1572
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,548
What? What?

1573
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,382
Oh.

1574
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,388
Oh. Cleo.

1575
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,253
- Cleo, wait. Ow!
- Excuse me.

1576
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,293
God damn it. Wait!

1577
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,850
Let me talk to... ow!

1578
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,225
Move, God damn it!

1579
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,923
Come here, Cleo!

1580
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,863
Call the police.

1581
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,196
Hey, yo, white boy.

1582
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,295
You really
in the music business?

1583
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,464
Why, do you have a mix tape?

1584
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,030
Shut the fuck up, white boy!

1585
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,440
And stop sweating
so goddamn much.

1586
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,035
You smell like bacon.

1587
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,046
And I'm a Muslim on Saturdays.

1588
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,105
Fucking wrong with you, huh?

1589
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,310
How you white and got a afro?

1590
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,410
That ain't cool.

1591
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,749
Damn, my head hurt!

1592
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,154
Hey, there go Cleo.
There go Cleo.

1593
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,021
Taxi.

1594
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:45,617
There go my baby, right there.

1595
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,127
Where she going?

1596
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,458
Where to, honey?

1597
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:49,828
Cleo!

1598
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,161
Oh, hell, yeah.

1599
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,669
There go that old
Snoop Dogg-looking motherfucker.

1600
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,795
Real Deal,

1601
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,339
they fitting to be real dead!

1602
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,034
I'm coming for you, old man!

1603
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,202
Hey, yo, Les, let them old
motherfuckers have it, man.

1604
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,609
- I'm going for it.
- Go for it, nigger.

1605
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,738
Get them motherfuckers.

1606
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,510
Hey, hey, hey.

1607
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,744
Come on, now. You know I'm the
only who drive the Mothership, man.

1608
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,286
Watch this shit with Lester

1609
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,615
about to kill
on these motherfuckers.

1610
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,280
That's how we live,
we do it like that.

1611
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,557
Louis!

1612
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,651
I'm back!

1613
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,923
Gun!

1614
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,089
Yeah!

1615
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:29,832
Oh, shit! Motherfucking
Lester got fucked up!

1616
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:30,963
God damn!

1617
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,575
I'm out of this motherfucker...

1618
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:35,905
- What about Lester, man?
- Fuck Lester.

1619
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,674
Yeah, fuck Lester!

1620
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:42,308
You don't even know Lester, man.

1621
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:46,779
Why you run over me, man!

1622
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:50,849
You old dirty bastard!

1623
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:55,194
Old Jim Brown, Fred Williamson,

1624
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:57,926
two-the-hard-way motherfuckers!

1625
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,127
I'll kill you, I swear...

1626
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,727
Aah! Shit!

1627
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,297
Let me kill you one time at least, man!

1628
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,740
You done fucked up the Mothership.

1629
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,936
I ought to stab you in your throat.

1630
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,137
Fuck you! Aah!

1631
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,975
You hear that?

1632
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,413
Shoot that motherfucker, Louis.

1633
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,781
Get your hands up!

1634
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:21,652
I can't, nigger. My arm's in a brace.

1635
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,488
Drop the weapon now!
Come on!

1636
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:31,895
This is my first time ever being in here.

1637
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,366
Quiet, please.

1638
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:41,037
This filthy-ass motherfucking place,

1639
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,668
man, got me itching.

1640
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,311
Yo, turnkey!

1641
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,077
Come on and let me out
of this motherfucker!

1642
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,414
You might want to wrap
your mind around the fact

1643
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:51,612
that we're gonna miss that show.

1644
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,416
Fuck you talking about, man?

1645
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,117
We gotta be in New York
tomorrow night.

1646
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,955
Uh-uh. Not me.

1647
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,255
I've had enough. I'm done.

1648
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,353
What, you're walking
out on me, Louis?

1649
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,728
Look, Floyd,
I was doing just fine

1650
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,096
before you showed up at my door.

1651
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,464
That's the thanks I get

1652
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,002
for pulling you out
of that fucking rat hole.

1653
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,332
You was just sitting up in there,

1654
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,599
just sitting there waiting to die.

1655
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:11,799
Negro, please.

1656
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,466
You ain't no different from me,

1657
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,170
Especially since your nephew
put your senile ass out to pasture

1658
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,405
and stole your business.

1659
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,310
Fuck you, Louis.

1660
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,441
Crawl back under that damn rock
you've been living.

1661
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,042
I don't need you.

1662
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,144
I'll do this shit by my damn self.

1663
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,714
Yo! Turnkey!

1664
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,555
Come on and let me
out of this motherfucker.

1665
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,390
I've had enough, man.
I want my lawyer.

1666
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:34,486
Relax, relax.

1667
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,497
You ain't gonna need no lawyer.

1668
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,692
Witnesses say
your story checks out,

1669
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,497
so you, sir, are good to go.

1670
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,972
Yeah.

1671
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,508
Whoa. Hold on there, Chuck Berry.

1672
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,806
You're gonna need a lawyer.

1673
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:53,609
Seems crossing state lines
is in violation of his parole,

1674
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,650
Not to mention
possession of firearms

1675
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,015
and driving without a license.

1676
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,144
No license?

1677
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:00,650
Step back for a minute.

1678
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,824
I hope your ass rot up in here,

1679
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,861
you criminal-bound
motherfucker, you.

1680
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:12,094
As Lao-Tzu says,
"Let things flow forward as they may."

1681
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,499
And I'm gonna let it flow, too, baby.

1682
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:18,768
And I got some Blackanese
philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

1683
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,332
You get by, Lou,
but you don't get away.

1684
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,674
You sit in shit,
you start to smell like it,

1685
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:25,304
so check the crack of your ass.

1686
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,542
Here's something else for you.

1687
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,743
Here go her number.

1688
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,311
Call her... Daddy.

1689
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,218
Fuck him, man!

1690
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,055
Let's get on
out of this motherfucker.

1691
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,459
He ain't worth
two damn flies smashed.

1692
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:43,857
Nigger.

1693
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,399
Hmph!

1694
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,849
Hey. Yo!

1695
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,622
Can I make a phone call?

1696
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,567
<i>You walking out on me, Louis?</i>

1697
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,006
<i>I've had enough. I'm done.</i>

1698
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,543
<i>You all right, man?</i>

1699
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,100
<i>Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.</i>

1700
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,737
<i>You're not all right.</i>
<i>You can't hardly breathe.</i>

1701
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,714
<i>You need a chest X-ray.</i>

1702
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,977
<i>I ain't trying to
make no comeback.</i>

1703
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,643
<i>I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.</i>

1704
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,017
<i>That's the thanks I get</i>

1705
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,350
<i>for pulling you out
of that rat hole,</i>

1706
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,548
<i>just sitting there waiting to die...</i>

1707
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,215
<i>sitting there waiting to die...</i>

1708
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,850
<i>- die, die...</i>
<i>- It's too late.</i>

1709
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,588
<i>Is there a doctor in the house?</i>

1710
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:50,963
Keep it short.

1711
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,466
<i>- Hey...</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

1712
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,264
<i>It's Cleo. Please leave a message.</i>

1713
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:02,741
Cleo... um, this is, uh, Louis.

1714
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,711
Louis Hinds.

1715
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,145
Your father.

1716
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,283
Wow, um,
feels funny saying that.

1717
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:12,513
I've, um, I've never said it before.

1718
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,317
Um...

1719
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,857
Listen.

1720
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,088
I didn't mean what I said.

1721
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,527
I was...

1722
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,969
Odetta was the love of my life.

1723
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,833
The worst thing
that ever happened to me

1724
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:33,636
was losing her and you.

1725
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,040
But you turned out great.

1726
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,375
She did a wonderful job with you.

1727
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:41,211
You know your mother
was an amazing woman.

1728
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:42,807
And I just want you to know

1729
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:47,948
I'm really, really glad I met you.

1730
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,115
And I wish I...

1731
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,756
Yo.

1732
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,700
All right.

1733
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,941
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1734
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:12,946
Hmm?

1735
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,505
Busting your ass out of jail.

1736
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,813
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

1737
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,216
Back up, Red. Get your keys out.

1738
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,276
Open that cell, okay?

1739
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,480
Deputy, don't listen to him.

1740
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,922
He will not shoot you.
Not on purpose anyway.

1741
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,459
Don't let him get you fucked up, Red.

1742
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:26,960
I'll kill you disco-dead.

1743
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,259
Now open that doggone cell, man.

1744
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,561
Stop shaking. If you shake,
I'm gonna start shaking.

1745
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,930
Next thing you know, kapow!

1746
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,229
Go on in.

1747
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,361
Now hand him the keys.

1748
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,132
Hand them to him.

1749
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,639
- Okay?
- Floyd.

1750
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,368
You sure you want to do this?

1751
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,910
Does everything gotta be
a fucking argument with you?

1752
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,343
God damn! Come on out of there!

1753
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,313
Close the door, Lou. Lock it up.

1754
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,713
I'm a hostage.

1755
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,183
You're gonna be a dead hostage

1756
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:51,378
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1757
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,549
Now look here, Red.

1758
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,181
I like you, almost.

1759
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:59,159
You call anybody outside
your mama, kapow.

1760
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,718
Okay?

1761
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:02,894
Let's get out of here.

1762
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,765
Anybody following us, man?

1763
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:07,893
Not yet.

1764
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,404
But you can bet your ass they will be.

1765
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:11,666
Lou, we gotta dump
the Mothership, man.

1766
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,900
We gotta dump it.

1767
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,442
You'd abandon the Mothership?

1768
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,875
We're fugitives from the law.

1769
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,878
We gotta start thinking like it.

1770
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,244
We're not fugitives, O.J.

1771
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,579
You're a fugitive. I'm a hostage.

1772
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,448
That's my story,
and I'm sticking to it.

1773
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,349
Wait, wait, wait.

1774
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:31,949
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1775
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,052
Look at that right there, man.

1776
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:36,393
Ain't that Lester's car?

1777
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,399
Motherfuckers.

1778
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:47,135
We're hungry, man. Come up with some
baked chicken or something.

1779
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,082
They're at it again.

1780
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,811
Oh, shit! Lester's car!

1781
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:12,766
- You hear that?
- What?

1782
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,061
That.

1783
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:20,302
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, no! Oh, God...

1784
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,671
Mr. Hinds. Mr. Henderson.

1785
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,905
It's so good to see you.

1786
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,447
Oh, my God.

1787
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:29,951
Oh, it was so hot in there.
You have no idea.

1788
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,009
If there's anything
I can get you,

1789
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,146
like a latte, I'm here for you guys.

1790
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,553
But first I really have to pee,

1791
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:36,989
so I'm just gonna hop on out.

1792
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,959
If you could give me
a hand out of here.

1793
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,187
I've been locked in there,

1794
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,059
and they've had the
woofers going all day.

1795
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,688
Oh, my God.

1796
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:46,131
I just have to pee real bad,
so if you don't mind.

1797
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:47,259
It's so good to see you.

1798
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,167
Oh, Mr. Hinds...

1799
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,711
Ahh...

Uh, that's my other line.

1822
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,312
I'll call you back. This is Danny.

1823
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:41,481
Hello, Mr. Epstein.

1824
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:44,218
<i>Phillip Newman.</i>
<i>I broke your stapler last week.</i>

1825
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,691
- Are you kidding me?
<i>- Hello?</i>

1826
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:46,989
Where the hell are you?

1827
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,859
Listen, I called
because I just wanted to let you know

1828
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,398
that everything's cool,
and we're still on target.

1829
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:52,694
We?

1830
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,429
You're with Henderson and Hinds?

1831
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,527
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1832
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,094
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

1833
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,434
but they're really good guys.

1834
01:17:58,507 --> 01:17:59,997
All right, well, good.

1835
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:01,406
You can give them this message.

1836
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,205
The network just called,
and they're off the show.

1837
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,905
But they can't do that!

1838
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,709
Oh, really? It's VH1.

1839
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,215
Have you seen <i>Flava of Love?</i>

1840
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,183
They can pretty much do
whatever they want.

1841
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:12,447
And another thing, you're fired.

1842
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,547
Motherfucker! What the fuck?

1843
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:25,062
What'd he say?

1844
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,231
Uh, he said I'm fired,

1845
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:33,764
and... and, uh,
and you're off the show.

1846
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:42,511
Are... Are you serious, man?

1847
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,444
I'm so sorry.

1848
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,731
Nnn! Nnn! Nnn!

1849
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:32,359
You know, uh,
according to the map,

1850
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,631
that road leads to the turnpike.

1851
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,331
I think we've still got time to make it.

1852
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,965
Make what, Louis?

1853
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,906
You heard what the motherfucker said!

1854
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,035
It's over!

1855
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,544
Fuck that.

1856
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:52,983
This shit ain't over till we
say it's over, all right?

1857
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:56,656
Things have changed,

1858
01:19:56,725 --> 01:20:00,786
and I have achieved
a state of mental clarity.

1859
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:02,090
Ain't that a bitch?

1860
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:03,392
You hear what this motherfucker said?

1861
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:06,263
Ever since I knocked
on your door, man,

1862
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:08,529
you've been beating my balls
at every fucking turn.

1863
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:12,266
Now all of a sudden, you've
got a state of clarity.

1864
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,069
Where was your clarity in L.A., Lou?

1865
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,632
You can't just dial that shit up

1866
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,974
like you calling for a pizza,
motherfucker.

1867
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,879
You got to go inside, do the work.

1868
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:23,543
Consequently,
I have a confession.

1869
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:29,320
Floyd, you were right about me.

1870
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:33,384
I have given up on a lot
of things in my life.

1871
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:35,929
But I ain't giving up on this. All right?

1872
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:39,797
Come on, man, we've been through
enough shit the last few days.

1873
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,267
We can do this.

1874
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,066
And I dare anybody
to try to stop us.

1875
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:46,107
Let's go, motherfucker.

1876
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,300
Shotgun.

1877
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,167
Get your ass in the backseat.

1878

01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:37,291
Full sound and switch on all
the floor monitors, all right?

1893
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,520
Look at that.
That's nice and subtle.

1894
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:40,720
I'm on it, then. Sound check.

1895
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:41,762
Okay. Thanks.

1896
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:42,762
- Mr. Epstein.
- Yeah?

1897
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,128
Hey, thank God you're here.

1898
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,359
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

1899
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,264
What are you doing here?
I thought I fired you.

1900
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,496
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not alone.

1901
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,109
You guys are insane!

1902
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:58,805
Good to see you, too, Little Ep.

1903
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,973
Yeah, this is never going to happen.

1904
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,745
You'll be arrested
the moment the cops spot you.

1905
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,615
We don't care anything about that.

1906
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,621
We just want to do our song.

1907
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,919
Oh, one other thing.
You got a few minutes?

1908
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,458
Yeah, I got all the time
in the world.

1909
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,153
I'm just producing a television show

1910
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,855
with dozens of huge musical acts

1911
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,057
that goes live in 171/2 minutes,

1912
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,066
but you know, let's grab some coffee
and have a little chit-chat.

1913
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,172
Wow. How long's he got?

1914
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,136
We don't know.

1915
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,169
All right.

1916
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,307
I'll see what I can do. Okay?

1917
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,975
Thank you.

1918
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,315
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1919
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,382
<i>please take your seats.</i>

1920
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,724
<i>The ceremony will begin shortly.</i>

1921
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:53,901
I'll get it.

1922
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,231
Wow!

1923
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,774
The Black Moses.

1924
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:02,877
How's it going, man?

1925
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:04,036
Hey, what's happening?

1926
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,044
what's up, baby?

1927
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:06,045
Hey, fellas.

1928
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,445
Hey, what's happening?

1929
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:08,948
- The man.
- My man.

1930
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:10,143
Okay, all right.

1931
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:12,413
Heard you were here.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

1932
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:14,544
Oh, by the way,

1933
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:16,214
brought somebody by to see you.

1934
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,349
Oh, is that right?

1935
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:18,722
Yeah.

1936
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,026
Okay, everybody,
let's move on out of here.

1937
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:29,331
Come on.

1938
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:31,269
All right, you heard what Mr. Henderson said.

1939
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:32,271
After you, young man.

1940
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,069
Okay.

1941
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:56,721
I'm sorry I ran out the way I did.

1942
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:00,264
I'm the one who ran out.

1943
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:02,462
There's no need for you to apologize.

1944
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,207
Can I help you with your tie?

1945
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:11,575
Yeah, sure.

1946
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,671
You know what you're doing?

1947
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:15,579
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1948
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:18,745
Here you go.

1949
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,686
Mm! Ohh!

1950
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:25,553
You all right?

1951
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:27,424
Yeah. Just some water, please.

1952
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:28,462
Damn!

1953
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,827
All cameras are on point.

1954
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,092
We just added two mics.

1955
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,827
Mr. Epstein!
You better come quick.

1956
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,493
Come on, I'm serious.
Come on! It's important!

1957
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,729
All right. Take care of those.

1958
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:36,828
15 minutes, Danny.

1959
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:40,766
He just collapsed.

1960
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,571
I think he's in a lot of pain.

1961
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,111
Open your hand.
Open your hand.

1962
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:45,237
Right there, right there.

1963
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,679
Okay, okay.

1964
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,182
Be strong, brother.
Hang on in there.

1965
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,117
It ain't time for you to check out now.

1966
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:54,450
Check out? What?

1967
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,854
Come on, man.
Everybody knows, man.

1968
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,257
My aunt was taking the same
doggone pills, man.

1969
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,989
Took her about a week
before she wasted away to nothing,

1970
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:03,257
just kicking and screaming.

1971
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,696
I don't know what killed her ass,

1972
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:08,065
but if she was taking those,
she had a bladder infection.

1973
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:09,262
Say what?

1974
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:12,500
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,
I got a kidney stone.

1975
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,064
Hurts like a motherfucker
when I pee,

1976
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,404
but it ain't gonna kill me.

1977
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:16,671
So you're not dying?

1978
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:20,111
From the first slap and cry,
we all start to die.

1979
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:22,843
But I ain't on no accelerated program,
hell, no.

1980
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:25,112
Ain't that about a bitch?

1981
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:28,053
All that damn hard work,
busting your ass out of jail,

1982
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:29,283
and you ain't even dying.

1983
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:30,722
I was kinda looking forward
to seeing you go.

1984
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,987
Excuse me, Danny.
They're on in two.

1985
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,653
All right. Where we at, guys?

1986
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:37,559
Okay, I'm good.

1987
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,028
The Apollo, the mecca.

1988
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,503
This brings back memories, man.

1989
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,199
how many times you think
we've performed here?

1990
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:47,468
Ooh, uh...

1991
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,839
ooh, five-oh.

1992
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:49,877
50, really?

1993
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,309
- Five-oh.
- Oh!

1994
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:52,539
Come on. Move, move.

1995
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,377
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

1996
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,713
<i>All units report, all units report.</i>

1997
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,183
<i>Suspects have been spotted.</i>

1998
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:01,222
<i>All units, apprehend them quietly</i>
<i>and by the book.</i>

1999
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,558
Hey, Lou, do you think
they're gone, man?

2000
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:06,150
I don't have X-ray vision, motherfucker!

2001
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:07,251
How would I know?

2002
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,558
Lower your voice, Lou.
Doggone it, man.

2003
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,462
It's so dark in here you can't see shit.

2004
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:12,761
Hold up.

2005
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,267
Let me see if I can reach my lighter.

2006
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,461
Don't light no lighter
up in here, man.

2007
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:17,027
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

2008
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,697
Hold on one minute.

2009
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,468
Shit.

2010
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:27,238
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

2011
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:29,715
Long way from Linwood Street, huh,
motherfucker?

2012
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:32,116
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

2013
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,121
He used both of us, and you know it.

2014
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,783
Come on, man. He just thought
he'd be a bigger star going solo.

2015
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:37,847
He was right.

2016
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:39,188
No he wasn't.

2017
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,921
He didn't want to split
the money three ways.

2018
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:42,121
Just look at him, sitting there

2019
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,256
with that old shit-eating
grin on his face.

2020
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:46,823
You think you're all that, motherfucker,
don't you?

2021
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,732
I have to admit, every time
I think about you,

2022
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,067
I could just choke the shit out of you!

2023
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,265
Stop it, stop it!

2024
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,171
Floyd, he ain't
thinking shit. He's dead.

2025
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:59,871
Say, ain't that my watch?

2026
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,939
See? You thought
I stole that mother...

2027
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:04,041
I told you this motherfucker
was a klepto!

2028
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:05,483
Shit, look at that.

2029
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:06,918
That's nice.

2030
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,080
Probably stole that, too.

2031
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:10,420
Motherfucker always had
good taste, though.

2032
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:11,822
I'm gonna keep this.

2033
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,295
Hey, Louis.

2034
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,561
You think if, you know...

2035
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:22,603
if he wouldn't have, you know, died,

2036
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,967
you think we would have
got back together?

2037
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:25,630
Oh, hell, no.

2038
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,538
But you know what?

2039
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:28,667
We are together,

2040
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,802
and I've been thinking
about our little arrangement.

2041
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:31,867
I'm gonna go ahead

2042
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:35,074
and break you off 50/50, all right?

2043
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,741
Wow, Lou, that's...

2044
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:39,480
that's real black of you, man.

2045
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,181
Because there ain't no money.

2046
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,280
Say what?

2047
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,325
Well, you said it yourself.

2048
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:45,381
It's a funeral.

2049
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,620
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

2050
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:48,093
You lied about the money?

2051
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:50,096
- Yeah.
- You motherfucker.

2052
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:52,029
Hey, you can't say
it wasn't worth it.

2053
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,965
Well, I could say it.

2054
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,634
But I'd be lying.

2055
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:59,366
I love you, Lou.

2056
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,533
My nigger.

2057
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:03,634
But this motherfucker,
you know, I can't help it.

2058
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,804
Every time,
I could just kill this motherfucker!

2059
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,848
That's why he left, because
you was always picking on him.

2060
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:08,973
Stop fucking with him.

2061
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,950
He fucked with my happiness.

2062
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:21,590
Ladies and gentlemen,

2063
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:24,131
I'm Isaac Hayes.

2064
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,958
Where the fuck are they, Danny?

2065
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:31,062
My good friends, please join me

2066
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:34,905
in saying farewell
to brother Marcus Hooks.

2067
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,280
It's Louis and Floyd!

2068
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,476
It's the Real Deal!

2069
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:46,543
Oh!

2070
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:49,419
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal,

2071
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,219
back together again.

2072
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,452
Give them a hand.

2073
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:54,222
Give them a hand.

2074
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:57,196
Reunited, y'all.

2075
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:58,664
They got their shit together.

2076
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:01,566
Yes! Let's go!

2077
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:03,467
Stand by.
Move in on my command.

2078
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:05,005
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2079
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,734
Come on, Officer
detective person.

2080
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:08,070
Please, just, you know, come on.

2081
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:10,007
Let them sing one song.
One little song.

2082
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:11,739
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

2083
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:13,440
The Real Deal!

2084
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:18,777
All right. One song.

2085
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,753
But it better be good.

2086
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:24,781
One song. The good one.

2087
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:30,523
How's that hip?

2088
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:31,690
Locked and loaded, baby.

2089
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:33,028
Let's do this.

2090
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,164
Band!

2091
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,228
Let's take a walk in the park.

2092
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:40,604
1, 2, 3, 4!

2093
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,314
# Oh, yeah #

2094
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,755
# When the river gets to rollin' #

2095
01:29:56,824 --> 01:30:00,453
# And then you add
a bowlful of soul in #

2096
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,793
# And then I tried
to let it all go then #

2097
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:05,526
# Oh, yeah #

2098
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,727
# Oh, it's easy to me #

2099
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:11,169
# You see, the way
I ride the rhythm #

2100
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,800
# You see, the truth
is all I can give 'em #

2101
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,572
# And the lyrics can
come from livin' #

2102
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:21,342
# Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me #

2103
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,111
# Oh, yeah #

2104
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:27,143
# Music comes out of my heart #

2105
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:31,180
# Something like a walking the park #

2106
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:34,319
# It's just a walk in the park #

2107
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:36,192
# Oh, yeah #

2108
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,994
# And no one else in here, I heard it #

2109
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:42,695
# I don't know what I've
done to deserve it #

2110
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:46,365
# You don't question it
while you serve it #

2111
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,703
# Oh, yeah #

2112
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,766
# Oh, it was given to me #

2113
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:53,371
# I got something you inherit #

2114
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:56,474
# I don't know that you
was born to share it #

2115
01:30:56,551 --> 01:31:00,487
# And if you shoot,
be sure you wear it #

2116
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:02,489
# Oh, yeah #

2117
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:03,888
# Oh, it comes naturally to me #

2118
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,188
# Uh-huh-uh #

2119
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,353
# Music comes out of my heart #

2120
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:09,896
# Yeah #

2121
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,559
# Something like a walk in the park #

2122
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,625
# It's just a walk in the park #

2123
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:16,670
# Oh, yeah #

2124
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:18,568
# Oh, yeah #

2125
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,369
Oh, yeah!

2126
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:23,501
Y'all having a good time
out here tonight?

2127
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,603
This is what I'm talking about!

2128
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,841
You know about that
walk in the park, man?

2129
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:29,405
Sure I know about
that walk in the park.

2130
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:30,974
You do? I'll tell you what.

2131
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:32,815
- Show them.
- Got to get down.

2132
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:41,822
Ladies and gentlemen,

2133
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:43,887
let's give a big Apollo welcome

2134
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:45,865
to the stage for the first time,

2135
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:50,063
my daughter, Miss Cleo Whitfield!

2136
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:53,732
# To make something out of nothin' #

2137
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:57,244
# That's what we all
got in common #

2138
01:31:57,311 --> 01:32:00,838
# So just hold on tight, I'm comin' #

2139
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,849
# Oh, yeah, yeah #

2140
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,350
# Said to me #

2141
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:07,581
# I'll give you something
you can believe in #

2142
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:11,421
# And then enjoy yourself
this evenin' #

2143
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:14,723
# And don't you dare
think about leavin' #

2144
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:16,592
# Oh, yeah #

2145
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:20,498
# Sing along with me #

2146
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:24,095
# Music comes out of my heart #

2147
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:26,571
# Something like a walk
in the park #

2148
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:27,801
# It's just a walk in the park #

2149
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,900
# It's just a walk in the park #

2150
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:31,569
# Oh, yeah, oh, yeah #

2151
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:33,238
# Oh, yeah #

2152
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:37,582
# Music comes out of my heart #

2153
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:42,021
# Something like a walk
in the park #

2154
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:44,887
# It's just a walk in the park #

2155
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:47,223
# Oh, yeah #

2156
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:51,692
# Music comes out of my heart #

2157
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:53,199
One song.

2158
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,360
# Something like a walk in the park #

2159
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:56,733
# A walk in the park #

2160
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,772
# It's just a walk in the park #

2161
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:00,101
# A walk in the park #

2162
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:02,142
# Oh, yeah #

2163
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,734
# Music comes out of my heart #

2164
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,871
I'm their manager!

2165
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:09,041
# Something like a walk in the park #

2166
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:10,879
# Walk in the park #

2167
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:12,146
# It's just a walk in the park #

2168
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:18,283
# Just like a walk in the park #

2169
01:33:20,528 --> 01:33:23,759
# Oh, yeah #

2170
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:39,441
Whoo!

2171
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:55,122
# <i>Yeah, ooh, yeah</i> #

2172
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:13,847
# Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo #

2173
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:14,972
# Haah #

2174
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,744
You're gonna sing real nice tonight.

2175
01:34:18,853 --> 01:34:19,911
<i>All right, y'all.</i>

2176
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:22,683
# <i>Got that funky time</i> #

2177
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:25,817
# <i>I can feel it</i> #

2178
01:34:25,893 --> 01:34:29,420
# <i>I can feel it</i> #

2179
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,362
# <i>I can feel it</i> #

2180
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,366
Any time the camera
or the mic comes on,

2181
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:36,869
I don't cheat myself.

2182
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:39,337
That was rule number 1
I was taught as a kid.

2183
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:41,204
And I definitely can't
cheat the audience.

2184
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:43,072
So I give 150%

2185
01:34:43,144 --> 01:34:46,238
every single time that I do anything.

2186
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:48,076
Even the way I live my life.

2187
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:51,016
I just cherish
each doggone moment.

2188
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,610
A black preacher's
something else, ain't it?

2189
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:56,714
You can't pay your rent
after you come from church.

2190
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:00,693
And if you ask the preacher
for the $5.00,

2191
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:03,753
he'll be like, "Fuck you
in the name of Jesus."

2192
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,595
My comedy is not fictitious.

2193
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,932
My comedy has
to come from my heart.

2194
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,336
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.
- All right, let's rehearse.

2195
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:17,934
He went through China
with his shit in his hand.

2196
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:20,503
Had five women against the wall.

2197
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:23,311
I betcha five dollars
that he fucked them all.

2198
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:24,681
He fucked them hard.

2199
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:25,878
He fucked them long.

2200
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:28,513
He fucked them till his shit got sore.

2201
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:31,057
He went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

2202
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,457
"Sorry, Charlie, your dick is dead."

2203
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:36,360
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,
that can't be true."

2204
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,058
"Yes, sir, Charlie,
your balls are too!"

2205
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:42,664
I've been performing all my life.

2206
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,398
So being in front of an audience

2207
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:46,099
has never been a problem for me.

2208
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:48,004
It's time to go?

2209
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:50,308
Well, go on, then.

2210
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:55,978
You want to leave a lasting impression
on your audience.

2211
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:58,610
You know, and that's something
I was taught, too,

2212
01:35:58,686 --> 01:35:59,983
when I first started.

2213
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:01,282
Always make them remember you,

2214
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:04,153
or remember something
about you and the film.

2215
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:07,854
I'm going back to my
$600-a-night hotel room,

2216
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:12,865
have me a nice-ass, uh,
piece of pussy and shit.

2217
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:13,991
Okay?

2218
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:16,127
Cut it.

2219
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:18,997
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

2220
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:21,098
I'm not even in yet.

2221
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:23,268
# I got to boogie for you #

2222
01:36:23,344 --> 01:36:25,312
# I got to boogie for you #

2223
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:27,643
# I got nothin' but boogie #

2224
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:30,013
# Nothin' but boogie for you #

2225
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:31,984
# I got nothin' but boogie #

2226
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,679
# Nothin' but boogie for you #

2227
01:36:33,754 --> 01:36:35,483
# Boogie, boogie #

2228
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:36,545
# Boogie, boogie #

2229
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:37,784
# Boogie, boogie #

2230
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:38,756
# Boogie, boogie #

2231
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:39,793
# Boogie, boogie #

2232
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,293
# Boogie, boogie #

2233
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:47,195
I want to say thanks to you all

2234
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:50,999
because you all made me... yeah.

2235
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:57,974
I wouldn't have
no TV show or movies.

2236
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:59,910
You all was coming to see me,

2237
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,641
and you all made me...

2238
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:04,650
Chattanooga, Louisiana, Mississippi.

2239
01:37:05,853 --> 01:37:07,844
So thank you.

2240
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:10,482
I think if I had a few free passes

2241
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:11,855
like a lot of people,

2242
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:14,417
I don't think I would be
as successful as I have.

2243
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,156
My task here on Earth

2244
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:19,358
is I have to work harder
than the average bear.

2245
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:20,365
It look easy, don't it?

2246
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:23,232
But it's not.

2247
01:37:23,304 --> 01:37:25,829
Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you.

2248
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:34,541
