00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,200
马库斯・胡克斯和正拳组和带来第6张专辑
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal, take 6.

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:07,237
-应该报三个人的名字  -你要我来唱主旋律吗
- That's three names. - You want me to sing the main line?

3
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:09,864
好啦  开唱吧  开唱吧
Oh, yeah, here we go, here we go.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,374
今晚我们将踏上南下的音乐之旅
Tonight we take a musical journey south,

5
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:15,412
传奇灵魂乐乐队马库斯・胡克斯和正拳组合
where the legendary soul band Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal

6
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,413
就是在那里练就了他们的标志性嗓音
developed their signature sound.

7
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:18,880
1  2
1, 2!

8
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,362
开始的时候  3人只是
They started out singing for pennies 

9
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:29,450
在孟菲斯的市井卖唱
On the street corners of Memphis.

10
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,461
片名  灵魂歌手
拉拉绳
Pull the string

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,021
我就向你眨眨眼
And I'll wink at you

12
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,691
我是你的玩偶
I'm your puppet

13
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,805
我会逗你笑
I'll do funny things

14
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:45,341
如果你想要
If you want me to

15
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,138
我是你的玩偶
I'm your puppet

16
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,180
我是你的
I'm yours

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,981
永远被你操纵
To have and to hold

18
00:00:57,054 --> 00:01:02,354
亲爱的  你能全权操控我这个小木偶
Darling, you've got full control of your puppet

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,827
但到了1972年
But by 1972,

20
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:06,385
马库斯・胡克斯和正拳组合
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal

21
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,695
已经成为蓝调音乐界的领军乐队
had become one of the biggest R&B acts in the world.

22
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,861
只有甜蜜灵魂乐
Nothin' like sweet soul music

23
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,871
让我们同聚首
To bring us together

24
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,533
他们在全球的演唱会票房都很火爆
They played to sellout houses all over the world.

25
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,303
卖出600万张唱片
They'd sold 6 million records

26
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:22,038
同时他们影响了一代美国乐坛
and influenced a generation of American musicians.

27
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:24,946
伴着甜蜜灵魂乐翩翩起舞
Dance to the sweet soul music

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,985
但这一切在1977年7月24日终结
But that all ended on July 24, 1977,

29
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,021
因为马库斯・胡克斯在纽约麦迪逊花园
when Marcus Hooks began his solo career

30
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:32,311
举办了一场激动人心的演唱会
with a dramatic concert

31
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:34,057
宣告自己单飞
at New York's Madison Square Garden.

32
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,752
女士们   先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

33
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:38,624
欢迎马库思・胡克斯
Marcus Hooks.

34
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:56,236
正当胡克斯在乐坛叱咤风云之时
But while Hooks became a music legend,

35
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:59,043
乐队的另两个成员弗洛伊德・亨德森和
the journey took a decidedly different direction

36
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:01,812
路易斯・海因兹毅然改变了曲风
for former band mates Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds.

37
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,682
他们凭借《公园漫步》一曲成名
Renowned for their signature dance stylings

38
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:08,452
其独特的舞步风格让他们备受赞誉
from their one breakout hit, "Walk in the Park,"

39
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:11,017
但是二人于1979年分道扬镳
the duo broke up in 1979.

40
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,585
据说是因为创作意见分歧
Citing creative differences

41
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:15,530
并且各自奔向自己的前程
and a desire to pursue separate projects.

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,692
退后  不许动
Back off! Freeze!

43
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:19,030
举起手  让我看见你的手
Get your hands up! Let me see them!

44
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:21,230
等等  等等  这不是...
Oh. Wait. Wait, wait. It ain't... Ohh!

45
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:24,103
枪是假的  不是真枪
The gun ain't real! Ow! It ain't real! Ow!

46
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:25,870
最新消息  正拳乐队成员路易斯・海因兹被捕
我只是没钱了  见鬼
I'm just broke, God it!

47
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,467
我没想伤害谁
I ain't tryin' to hurt no!

48
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,012
小心你的爪子
Watch your damn hands!

49
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,546
警察真他妈的残忍
Police mother brutality!

50
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:31,979
而另一位弗洛伊德・亨德森
While Floyd Henderson...

51
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,146
欢迎光临弗洛伊德洗车服务公司
Come on down to Floyd's Car Wash,

52
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,279
您的爱车全部享受手工擦洗服务
where everything is done by hand.

53
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:40,118
他将其出色的表演
...combined his showmanship

54
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,386
同商业头脑相结合
with an entrepreneur spirit.

55
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,586
别忘了"销魂星期日"哦
And don't forget about Super Soul Sundays,

56
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,755
整车清洗

57
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:48,890
外带免费清洗轮胎
to guarantee a free rimjob.

58
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:53,628
来吧  免费洗轮胎
Come on. Get your rimjob.

59
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:54,796
快来免费洗轮胎
Come get your rimjob.

60
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,136
快来免费洗轮胎
Come and get your rimjob!

61
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,234
被人遗忘的正拳组合亨德森和
Whatever happened to the forgotten duo Henderson and Hinds

62
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,710
海因兹究竟都遭遇了什么呢
The Real Deal?

63
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,246
宝贝  把导航仪打开
Baby, turn the navigation on.

64
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:09,980
希望在天黑前能到地方
I hope we can find this place sometime tonight.

65
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:11,646
他会爱上那儿的
He gonna love it there.

66
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,747
那里有坎麦可调床
They got Craftmatic adjustable beds,

67
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,849
声控灯

68
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,757
跟你们说过了  最好安静点
Y'all better shut up back there, I'm tellin' you.

69
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,022
我真想把手伸到后座上
I'm gonna reach back there

70
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:21,564
把一个小崽子倒拎起来揍一顿
and pop one of them little boys upside the head so bad.

71
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,795
弗洛伊德叔叔  我想这就是我们要的
I think that's it, Uncle Floyd.

72
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,538
真不敢相信我竟然任你埋怨
Now, I can't believe I let you talk me into this bullshit.

73
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:33,600
你想说什么  这多美啊  你不喜欢吗
What you talking about? It's beautiful. You don't like this?

74
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:34,769
这就是一死气沉沉的营地
It's a death camp.

75
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:37,177
叔叔  它怎么就是死气沉沉的营地啦
Oh, how is it a death camp, Unc?

76
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,375
这里有36个洞高尔夫场地
We got 36 holes of golf.

77
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,077
3个游泳池
Three swimming pools.

78
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:43,051
这地方的男女比例
You know the ratio of women to men here

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,714
是1比5  叔叔  1比5啊
is 5 to 1, Unc? 5 to 1.

80
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,086
意思是这的小妞儿一大片
That mean you got 'em everywhere.

81
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:48,419
挤得你都动不了  到处是小妞儿...
You can't even move. There's women...

82
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:49,959
随便看一圈
Every time you look around,

83
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:52,086
身边到处都是妞儿
women crawling between your legs, arms, anything.

84
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,995
见鬼  叔叔  如果你担心生意的话
I mean, damn, Unc. And if you're worried about the business,

85
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,089
我来搞定
I got that.

86
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,895
你那套我都学会了
You taught me everything you know.

87
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,560
是啊
Yeah.

88
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:01,605
行啊  我告诉你  小子
Yeah. You know something, son?

89
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:02,639
你真够狡猾的
You're real crafty.

90
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:03,638
多谢夸奖
Appreciate that.

91
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,197
第一步  你搬进我家
See, first you move into my house.

92
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,971
然后  你抢走我的生意
Then you take over my business.

93
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:08,568
-伙计  我没有抢走  -对了  还有
- Aw, man, I ain't taking...  - Oh, yeah.

伙计  再然后  你想尽办法骗我到这个山谷来
Then you move me all the way out to the Valley, man,

95
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:11,905
就没人听到我尖叫了  对不
so can't nobody hear me scream. Right?

96
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:14,348
实际上  这就是为啥把你弄到这来
Actually, that's why we're moving you here.

97
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,409
在这里护士才能听见你的驴叫
So the nurses can hear your ass scream.

98
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:17,852
还记得你摔倒在地板上躺了三天吗
You remember you fell on that floor for three days

99
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:19,890
-没人听见你求救  -我记得
- and couldn't nobody hear you. - I remember.

100
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:24,291
那就行了  别抱怨啦  享受人生吧  叔叔
Yeah. Now, stop being bitter, man. Enjoy yourself, Unc.

101
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:27,125
你的黄金时代到来了  伙计
There are your golden years, player.

102
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:29,824
来吧  进屋里来
Now, come on in the house and say bye

103
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,561
和沙琳还有孩子们告别
to Charlene and the kids.

104
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,093
见鬼的小崽子
Fuck them kids.

105
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:36,196
见鬼的小崽子
Fuck the kids?

106
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:37,365
就是
Yeah.

107
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,548
就这样  宝贝儿
Ohhh... yeah, baby.

108
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:24,712
快给我  快  快点
Ohh! Oh, give it to me. Give it to me nice and hard.

109
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,451
就是这样
Oh, right there!

110
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,457
宝贝  别停
Ooh. Don't stop, baby.

111
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,200
不  你不能跑
No, you're not getting away.

112
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:40,535
真爽
Yummy!

113
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:05,054
髋关节感觉怎样
How's the hip?

114
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,254
还行
Fine.

115
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:08,355
那就好
Okay.

116
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,568
好了  亨德森先生
Okay, Mr. Henderson.

117
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,236
请站起来  面向窗户
I'm gonna need you to, uh, stands up, face the window,

118
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:23,006
趴在桌子上
and bend over the table.

119
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,877
大夫  我的病跟屁股没关系
My problem ain't back in that area, doctor.

120
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:27,143
亨德森先生  你的睡眠问题
Look, Mr. Henderson, your sleep problem

121
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,685
可能是多种原因引起的
can be a symptom of a myriad of different conditions,

122
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:30,981
其中之一  就是
some of which, you know, are...

123
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,250
您的屁股
well, you know, back in that area.

124
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:38,795
我讨厌有人像同性性交那样在我后面
I don't like nobody behind me like that, Huds.

125
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:40,625
告诉你  我不喜欢有人捅我的
I'm telling you, I just don't like nobody playing

126
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:42,358
-屁股眼  -我会很轻很轻的
- with my penny. - I'll be very gentle.

127
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:43,923
您不会有多大感觉的
I'll be in and out before you know it.

128
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:49,030
趴那儿  对了
Just bend over. There you go.

129
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,734
抓住  抓紧啦
Hold on, now. Get a good grip.

130
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,209
放松
Just relax.

131
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,210
放松
Relax.

132
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,677
坐在海边码头上
Sittin' on the dock of the bay

133
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:02,776
看海...潮
Watching the tiiiiiide

134
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:04,946
潮...起...潮...落
Roll away

135
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,417
好了  亨德森先生  再说一次
All right, again, Mr. Henderson,

136
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,323
您身体绝对没问题
there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.

137

You got a pantry full of dog food. I don't see no dog.

275
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:37,770
狗在床底下  黑鬼
Dog under the bed, nigger! You lucky

276
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:39,611
你进门  狗没咬你屁股算你走运
he ain't attacked your ass when you came in.

277
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,674
你就是那条狗  混蛋
You're the dog, motherfucker!

278
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:46,754
你的存款都干什么用了  伙计
What happened to all that fucking money you done saved, man?

279
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:49,053
存款  放屁
Saved? Shit.

280
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,593
从水门事件那时开始直到
I don't remember shit from Watergate

281
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:53,185
航天飞机爆炸
to when the space shuttle blew up.

282
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:54,423
我就不记得有存款
Hmm. Money I saved.

283
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:55,352
好吧  还有歌曲的版税呢
Okay, what about the royalties?

284
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,862
我曾经每年能得到3万块呢
I used to get over $30,000 a year off that shit.

285
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,698
我赌扑克输了我的那份  行了吧
I lost my royalties in a poker game. All right?

286
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,000
-扑克  -你听好  伙计
- Poker? - Listen here, man.

287
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:05,234
如果你真想让我
If you serious about un-assing me

288
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:07,276
再度出山
from my lavish surroundings here,

289
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,244
伙计  你得考虑
man, you gonna have to be a little more flexible

290
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:12,406
小让一步  就...
in your thinking. Say, oh...

291
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:13,506
我6你4吧
60/40.

292
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,676
伙计  你可真是混帐加三级
Man, you must be higher than a motherfucker.

293
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:18,186
我们一直对半分的
We always split shit straight down the middle.

294
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:19,882
如果我不去演出
Ain't gonna be nothing to split

295
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,218
你连分都没啥可分的  是吧
if I don't show up, now, is there?

296
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,590
分不到6成  我就不去
And I ain't showing up unless I get 60% of the proceeds.

297
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:25,889
反正你有钱  混帐东西
You rich anyway, motherfucker.

298
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:28,760
我在电视上看过的你洗车广告了
I seen your little car wash commercials on the TV.

299
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:31,630
我已经把所有的生意都转给我外甥了
I transferred all my business affairs over to my nephew.

300
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,726
-我现在靠固定收入  伙计  -那又怎样
- I'm on a fixed income, man. - So what?

301
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:35,703
那就是中大奖了
So your draws!

302
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:37,433
所以现在2万元对我来说
That's why that 20 damn thousand dollars

303
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:39,441
-很有吸引力  -是一万六
- look good to me right now.- 16!

304
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:42,410
六四分成后你该得的那份
That's your cut of a 60/40 split.

305
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,969
这就是我的条件
And those are my terms.

306
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:46,015
而且没有商量的余地
And they're non-negotiable.

307
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,844
55/45
55/45.

308
00:14:58,128 --> 00:14:59,891
去你大爷的
Fatherfuck you, man.

309
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:02,693
你要我六四分
You're gonna tell me 60/40.

310
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:04,563
你有什么资格命令我
You don't dictate to me!

311
00:15:04,634 --> 00:15:07,068
我是他妈的弗洛伊德・亨德森
I'm Floyd motherfucking Henderson.

312
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:08,661
你和马库斯  都是我
You and Marc, I made you

313
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,262
造就了你和那个混蛋
and that motherfucker!

314
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,537
你不会唱歌  不会发鼻音  不会他妈的跳音
You can't sing, hum,or motherfucking skip.

315
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,941
我说得不对吗
Ain't that a bitch?

316
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,808
都他妈的见鬼去吧
Skip on these motherfucking nuts!

317
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,415
希望你和马库斯都下地狱
You and Marcus, may you rest in shit.

318
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,178
混蛋  我是弗洛伊德・亨德森
Motherfucker.I'm Floyd fucking Henderson,

319
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,447
你这个道貌岸然的混蛋
you Apostle-faced motherfucker!

320
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:28,080
这个混蛋又冲我摔门
This motherfucker slams this door in my face one more time...

321
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:29,750
我烦透这个混蛋了
I'm tired of this motherfucker!

322
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:33,191
总是和这个混蛋过不去
Always had a problem with this bitch.

323
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:36,190
他啥都不是  一无所知
He ain't nothing. He's ignorant!

324
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,427
一个混蛋白痴
Motherfucker's just a idiot.

325
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,969
头脑简单的混球  整天无所事事
Chihuahua-head motherfucker, man, sitting up there,

326
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:43,130
还告诉别人自己有多忙
always want to tell somebody what to damn do.

327
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:45,640
他难道都是和傻子吹牛
He gonna sit there and talk the fool?

328
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,542
娘的  我血压又升高了
Ooh, my blood pressure's high, motherfucker.

329
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,919
不要让这个混蛋气成这样
Don't let this motherfucker get you like this.

330
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,286
又怎么啦
What!

331
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,351
别叫
Stay!

332
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:14,969
首先  我要明确声明并记录在案
First of all, I clearly want to state this for the record.

333
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:18,166
我发现这种分配方式太卑鄙了  伙计
And I find this arrangement we got,man, despicable.

334
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,835
但我是弗洛伊德・亨德森  一个老演员
But I'm Floyd Henderson.I'm a trouper.

335
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,310
你知道我会不惜一切代价
And you know I'd do any doggone thing, man,

336
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,211
让这个乐队重返乐坛  伙计
to see this group get back on its feet,

337
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,146
因为你知道我是就是那种人
'cause you know that's the type of motherfucker I am.

338
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,684
但是  同时
But in the meantime,

339
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:32,381
我要回我一晚上600美元的宾馆了
'm going back to my $600-a-night hotel room,

340
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:35,219
去洗个舒服的泡泡浴
and I'm gonna have me a nice hot bubble bath

341
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,816
洗掉这一身从你住的黑屋里
to wash some of this filth and dirt and grime

342
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:40,954
染上的污垢和晦气
from this black fucking hole you live in.

343
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:44,467
然后再吃上一顿肥美多汁
Then I'm having me a nice, juicy-ass steak, oh, yeah,

344
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,298
和你屁股一样大的牛排
the size of your motherfucking back.

345
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,464
再然后冲个澡刮刮胡须
Then I'm gonna take me a shit shower and shave.

346
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,508
早上六点钟我会到这里
And I'll be here at 6 a. m.

347
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,042
接你去该死的机场
To take you to the motherfucking airport.

348
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,304
-听清楚了  -我不坐飞机
- You got me? - I don't fly.

349
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,606
且我早上8点起床
And I get up at 8.

350
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:01,048
等我表弟从州监狱出来
My cousin out the penitentiary,

351
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,948
我就让他宰了这混蛋
I'm gonna have him kill this motherfucker!

352
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,615
他妈的跟我说话没大没小
Man talk to me like I'm a motherfucking kid.

353
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,816
我可不是三岁小孩
I ain't no motherfucking kid.

354
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,223
每次我们一起上路
Every time we... we start on the road,

355
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,057
他就开始说同样的废话
he starts in saying the same shit.

356
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:15,527
喂  谁给我拿午饭
Hey! Who's got my lunch?

357
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:16,530
你是谁
Who are you?

358
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,657
先生  我是菲利浦・纽曼
I'm Phillip Newman, sir,

359
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,065
新来的实习生  你大约
the new intern. You hired me,

360
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:20,329
20分钟前雇了我
like, 20 minutes ago.

361
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:21,870
查克斯・纽曼是我叔叔
Chuckles Newman's my uncle.

362
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,269
-是他告诉你...  -住嘴
- He's the one that told you...- Stop talking.

363
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,000
-遵命  -我已经给了你一份工作
- Very good. - I already got a job for you.

364
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,633
好吗  看看那个
Okay? Bing, bang, boom.Look at that.

365
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,201
对  亨德斯和海因兹  马库斯以前的和声
Yeah. Henderson and Hinds,Marcus' old backup singers,

366
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,110
对悼念什么的一无所知
are being real dickheads about this tribute thing...

367
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,376
天啊  亨德森和海因兹  正拳组合
Oh, my God! Henderson and Hinds!The Real Deal.

368
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,042
他们是唯一一支在单集《灵魂列车》中
They're the only band that got to play three songs

369
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:36,517
演唱三首插曲的乐队
on a sing episode of Soul Train.

370
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,248
唐・科尼利厄斯当时在场  我还录下来了
Don Cornelius was there as a witness,and I got it on VHS.

371
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:40,846
他们来这儿不是干这个  好吗
They don't do that here. All right?

372
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,585
-是的  先生  -这是唱片公司
- Yes, sir.  - This is a record label,

373
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,717
不是歌迷俱乐部
not a fan club.

374
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,761
我要那两个老家伙周六到这里
I want those two old fucks there on Saturday,

375
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,456
现在派你去办这件事
and I want you to make that happen.

376
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,462
明白了吗
Got it?

377
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:18,059
正拳组合要复出  谁也无法阻挡
The Real Deal is back,and they not gonna stop us now.

378
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:21,154
该死的
Ohh! Shit.

379
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,666
那他妈的是什么  伙计
What the fuck is that, man?

380
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,133
枪啊
This is a gun.

381
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,432
没它就无法穿过三K党的地盘
I never travel through Klan country without one.

382
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:29,995
-你介意吗  -当然
- You got a problem with that, pops?  - Yeah,

383
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:31,233
我对那很有意见  伙计
I got a problem with that, man.

384
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:32,706
上次我看到枪的时候
The last time I saw that gun,

385
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:34,300
你正指着我  要打我
you were pointing at me,and you were shooting it.

386
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:36,607
听好了  弗洛伊德  我们不是两个老朋友
Listen here, Floyd.We ain't two old friends

387
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:37,737
在某个周日驾车去做什么
out for some Sunday drive

388
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,111
缅怀往事的旅游  懂吗
down Memory Lane. All right?

389
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:42,083
事实上  我一看见你就来气
Fact is, I can hardly stand the sight of your ass,

390
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:44,518
所以你就不要惹我
so you best not to provoke me.

391
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:45,713
惹了又怎样
Or what's gonna happen?

392
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,450
从这里到我们目的地之间
There's a lot of empty road

393
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:49,719
有很多空荡荡的路
between here and where we trying to go.

394
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:50,919
在那里如果一个黑鬼消失了
Where a nigger could disappear

395
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,757
也不会有人想他
and where nobody'd miss his black ass.

396
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:56,497
让我看看那支枪
Well, let me see that gun.

397
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:59,292
让我看看
Let me see it!

398
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:00,631
小心点啊  傻瓜
Be careful, fool.

399
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,671
你以为我不会拿枪吗  伙计
You don't think I know how to hold a gun, man?

400
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,331
我可是美国步枪射击运动协会的一员
I'm a member of the NRA, man.

401
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:08,202
在哪...怎么...老天啊
Where's... Now, what's... God damn it!

402
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:09,210
该死
Oh! Shit!

403
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:11,608
见鬼
Damn it.

404
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:14,981
开走  开走  该死的  开走
Drive! Drive! God damn it, drive!

405
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:16,018
救命
Help me!

406
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,515
抓住方向盘  蠢货

你他妈的什么毛病

不要在车里开枪
Don't shoot no gun in a car!

410
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:31,329
你说...保险栓没拉上吗
You said... The safety wasn't on there.

411
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,198
保险栓个屁
Safety, my ass!

412
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:34,668
保险栓没有
Safety wasn't...

416
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,270
亚利桑那州  旗杆镇
距阿波罗演出还有4天

417
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,840
仅此一晚  千载难逢  正拳组合

418
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,638

致  意
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

Been a long time since we saw our name in lights.

421
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,312
我们的名字怎么在霓虹灯上
What our name doing up in lights?

422
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,479
我们周末要在阿波罗剧场演出

我们有30多年没上过舞台了
We ain't been on stage in over 30 years.

424
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:30,484
现在  最不应该做的事情
Now, the last thing you want to do

425
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,187
就是在这里傻站着  是不是
is stink up the joint. Am I right?

426
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,923
所以我准备了一些热身演唱
And I got us free dinner to boot.

427
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,906
伙计  我还留着这些衣服真是走运
Man, we sure are lucky I kept these threads.

428
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:46,498
看我们多帅啊

Better hope that button don't pop off and kill nobody.

430
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:53,239
天啊  裤子这么紧希望不会挤爆我的蛋蛋
God damn, I wish these pants weren't squeezing my nuts so tight.

431
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,147
也许会帮你唱出高音
Maybe it'll help you hit those high notes.

432
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,778
我根本不需要帮助就能唱出高音
I don't need help hitting the high notes.

433
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:00,152
-是啊  走着瞧  -走着瞧

这儿还有观众

495
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:50,285
就算只有两三个仍然是观众
I don't care if it's two or three.It's a audience.

我们过去搞砸了
What fucked our shit up back in the day

505
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:08,671
是因为你搞了我的女人

506
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:23,991
女士们  先生们

517
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:53,678
还是继续怄气
or we just gonna let it fester?

518
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:59,124
好吧  我是有点迟钝  行了吧
All right. Well, I was a little rusty, okay?

519
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:00,787
说你迟钝都是轻的
That's a insult to rust, ain't it?

520
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:02,455
那你呢  混蛋
Well, what about you, motherfucker?

521
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:05,262
昨晚上你好像被水泥卡住了似的
Last night, look like you were stuck in cement.

522
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:06,528
路易斯  我做过髋关节置换手术
I had a hip replacement, Louis.

523
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:08,229
那你应多付100美元
Well, you should've paid a hundred more dollars

524
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:10,329
换一个豪华点  有点节奏感的型号
and got the deluxe model with some rhythm in it.

525
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:12,237
就因为你换的那个破髋关节
'Cause that motherfucker you got,

526
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:14,401
-它不好使  -算你对  伙计
- it ain't working.- Oh, that's fine, man.

527
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:15,535
但是我们要谈的不是这个
But that's not what we talking about.

528
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:17,169
我是说奥黛特
I'm talking about Odetta.

529
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:20,509
路易斯  如果我们之间

532
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:25,485
就是这么回事

533
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:26,681
现在  这烂事还
Now, there's some shit

534
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:28,587
余臭未消
that's just etched in stone.

535
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:30,558
最重要的是
First and foremost is

536
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:35,029
朋友妻  不可欺
thou shall not dig for diamonds in another brother's mine!

537
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:37,827
胡扯  伙计  你自己也有责任
Bullshit, man. You gotta take some responsibility here.

538
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,992
你以为她不知道
You think she didn't know, man,

539
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:40,194

还有睡别的女人  她知道

她跑过来告诉我  "我的男人
She came running to me telling, "My man

543
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:48,166
路易斯做这  路易斯做那  抱抱我  弗洛伊德"
Louis did this. Louis did that.Hold me, Floyd. "

544
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:49,575
那好  睡了她不打紧
All right, well, getting the pussy is one thing.

545
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:51,078
-你也不必和她结婚吧  -什么
- You ain't had to marry her.- What?

546
00:25:51,147 --> 00:25:52,546
你就是个只会脱裤子的蠢货
You'd have to be a zip-down fool

547
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:54,276
让她从你手指尖溜走了  伙计
to let her slide through your fingers, man.

548
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,079
好吧  如果我是蠢货  你也是
All right, well, if I'm a fool, then you are, too.

549
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:58,916
你以为我不知道  她也伤了我的心
You think I don't know that? She hurt my heart, too.

550
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:02,549
很好  这真是他妈的少得可怜的安慰
Good!That's a poor motherfucking comfort.

551
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,890
但是  不管怎么说  也是个安慰
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

552
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:07,190
每晚我都告诉你
Every night I'm telling

553
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:10,923
只要在这里  你就会快乐
Every time you're here, you're making

554
00:26:23,746 --> 00:26:26,738
那你在奥黛特之后又结过几次婚
Well, how many times did you say you was married after Odetta?

555
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:30,245
四次
Four.

556
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:32,785
我和一个叫埃斯特尔的女孩儿结婚
I married this girl named Estelle

557
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:34,389
想忘掉奥黛特
to get over Odetta.

558
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:35,924
后来又和亨丽埃塔结婚
Then I married Henrietta.

559
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:38,187
她不适合我
She wasn't no good for me.

560
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:39,558
后来又和乔瑟芬结婚
Then I married Josephine.

561
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:42,598
她当然也不适合我  因为后来她遇见了卡尔
She definitely wasn't no good for me because she met Carl.

562
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,656
好  那是第三个
All right. That's three.

563
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,429
谁是幸运的第四个呢
Who was lucky number four?

564
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:48,333
她叫康斯薇洛
Her name was Consuelo.

565
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:51,032
她离开我回古巴了
She left me and went back to Cuba.

566
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:54,099
哈哈  人们还真愿意回古巴
Ha ha ha!People actually go back to Cuba?

567
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,269
她说她宁愿余生待在
She said she'd rather spend the rest of her life

568
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:58,677
独裁国家也不愿意再跟我多待一个晚上
under that dictatorship than spend another night with me.

569
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:03,344
你呢  你为什么不结婚
How 'bout you? How come you never got married?

570
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,252
我本来可以在菲律宾的马尼拉
I almost hooked up with this girl down in the Philippines,

571
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,311
搭上一女孩儿的
in Manila.

572
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:11,522
但是  我不会说
But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

573
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:13,687
塔加路族语  她唯一会的英语就是
Tagalog, and only English she knew

574
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:15,754
花两美元我就让你爽个够
was, "Me love you long time for two dollar. "

575
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:21,026
在奥黛特之后我就不擅长谈恋爱
Yeah, I wasn't no good at relationships after Odetta.

576
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:22,400
你有她的消息吗
You ever hear from her?

577
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:23,699
谁  那个菲律宾女孩儿
Who, Mai Mai?

578
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:24,705

就在圣诞节的时候
It was sometime around Christmas.

582

583
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:37,018
妈的  啪  啪  啪  啪  啪
Fuck it.Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

584
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:38,713
你在干什么
What you doing?

585
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:40,517
-我看到一个歹徒  -你为什么不把枪口朝上
- I saw a coyote. - Whyn't you put that thing up

586
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:41,886
省得伤到人  伙计
before somebody get hurt, man?

587
00:27:41,957 --> 00:27:43,322
你怎么老觉得我不会拿
How come you think I don't know how to handle

588
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,757
-这玩意  伙计  -认为

589
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:47,319

683
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:05,245
我为你摇摆
I got to boogie for you

684
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:07,755
我就是想要摆
I got nothing but boogie

685
00:32:07,823 --> 00:32:09,950
只想为你摇摆
Nothing but boogie for you

686
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:11,686
我就是想摇摆
I got nothing but boogie

687
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,193
只想为你摇摆
Nothing but boogie for you

688
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:15,924
摇摆  摇摆  摇摆  摇摆
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

689
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:18,296
摇摆  摇摆  摇摆  摇摆
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

690
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,062
摇摆  摇摆  摇摆  摇摆
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

691
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:21,966
我为你摇摆
I got to boogie for you

692
00:32:31,146 --> 00:32:33,171
有爱共享  宝贝
Share the love, baby.

693
00:32:35,517 --> 00:32:37,280
你刚在台上做了招牌动作  对吧
You know you pulled the Al Green up there, right?

694
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:39,048
我没有  路  别提那个
No, I didn't, Lou. Don't start that...

695
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:40,247
我们刚刚下台
We barely got offstage

696
00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:41,983
你就屁颠屁颠的跑回去了
when you ran your ass back out there.

697
00:32:42,057 --> 00:32:44,651
要不要返场观众说了算
Look, an encore is at the audience's discretion.

698
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,285
你应该等他们要求再这么做
You're supposed to wait till they ask for it.

699
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:48,057
-你知道他们想要返场  -我不关心他们想不想
- You know they wanted it.  - I don't care what they wanted.

700
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,893
你的行为太不专业了
That shit was unprofessional.

701
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:51,296
伙计
Man...

702
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,567
噢
Say,

703
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:59,938
我记起为什么我喜欢公路旅行啦
I'm starting to remember why I love the road so much.

704
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:02,443
就是这个
Yeah.

705
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:10,643
如果我的直觉是正确的
If my instincts serve me right,

706
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,778
你今晚得给自己另开个房间了
you're about to find yourself another room tonight.

707
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:15,688
你知道那些蓝色小药丸会让你失明  对吧
You know those little blue pills make you go blind, right?

708
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:21,719
你要是持续勃起  可别喊我救命
Don't call me when you get that four-hour erection.

709
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:23,321
来吧  小宝贝
Hey, now, baby girl.

710
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:28,929
来吧  来吧
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

711
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,031
给我吧
Yeah, give it to me.

712
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,100
小药丸给我力量吧
Those little pills, give me strength.

713
00:33:35,177 --> 00:33:36,337
一点就够了
A little strength.

714
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,642
今晚一定让你爽死
I'm going to fuck your brains out.

715
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,479
天啊  你真重
Oh! Oh, you're heavy.

716
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:48,515
怎么了  宝贝
what's wrong, baby?

717
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,852
没什么
Nothing.

718
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:53,224
我只是  我...
I just, uh, you know, I...

719
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:55,490
我从来没和像你这样的人做过
I just never been with someone like you before.

720
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:58,226
传说都是真的  但是让我告诉你
It's true what they say.  But let me tell you something.

721
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,666
弗洛伊德・亨德森很好很温柔
Floyd Henderson gonna be nice and gentle.

722
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:02,431
你的第一个黑男人
Your first taste of dark meat

723
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:04,335
会让你欲仙欲死  相信我
gonna be smooth and sweet, trust me.

724
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:05,566
我不是说这个
No, I didn't mean that.

725
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:07,939
我只是
It's just, uh, you know,

726
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,343
从来没和像你这么老的人做过
I've never been with someone so old.

727
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:12,573
老
Old?

728
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:15,242
你他妈也不是什么小女生
You ain't no teen queen your damn self.

729
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:20,179
别这样  老婆子  过来  宝贝
Come on, mama. Come here, baby.

730
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:21,483
宝贝  宝贝  听着
Baby, baby. Look here.

731
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:24,754
让我们用上积攒了几十年的性经验
Let's take our decades of sexual experience

732
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:26,522
在这个探索与狂喜之夜
and combine them for one night

733
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:28,392
尽情结合  怎么样
of exploration and bliss, can we do that?

734
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:32,530
我不会让你失望的
I won't disappoint you.

735
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,865
好吧
All right.

736
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:36,996
这就是我所说的
That's what I'm talking about.

737
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:38,403
我要吃你的奶
I want to suck one of them titties.

738
00:34:38,474 --> 00:34:40,942
真的  我有东西让你看
Oh, yeah? Well, I got something to show you.

739
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:44,372
我全身发热  忍不住要搞我自己
I'm so hot, I'm about to fuck myself.

740
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:46,638
使劲吻我
Bite my lip off.

741
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:48,580
哎呀
Oh. Look!

742
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,083
来吧  我忍不住了  宝贝
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

743
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:51,744
今晚我得大干一场
Tonight I ain't got no control like that no more.

744
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,551
希望你不会介意毛太多
Now, I hope you don't mind a little hair.

745
00:34:55,624 --> 00:34:59,355
宝贝  60年代我就性觉醒了
Baby, I found my sexual awakening in the '60s.

746
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:02,955
我最喜欢又硬又多毛茸茸
Nothing I like better than a big old fluffy...

747
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:06,394
见鬼  娘们儿
Damn, girl.

748
00:35:06,468 --> 00:35:08,402
你的阴毛可真是茂盛
That's a whole bunch of hair you got down there.

749
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,438
是吧  我把它称作自然景观
Yeah, I call it the natural look.

750
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:12,804
你那是有什么毛病吗
You sick?

751
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,672
我知道是多了一些
I know it's big.

752
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,335
你得剃掉点
You need a pick.

753
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:17,708
你想让我先刮一刮吗
You want me to shave it?

754
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,943
我们没时间也没工具去干那活儿
We ain't got the time or apparatus for that type of job.

755
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,745
好吧  忽略这个问题
Okay, disregard.

756
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:27,779
看看谁来吃饭了
Look who's coming to dinner.

757
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:29,687
正是时候  对吧
Right on time, ain't it?

758
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:31,191
我绝对是个硬汉
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

759
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:34,053
你知道接下来我要做什么吗
You know what I'm gonna do for you?

760
00:35:34,129 --> 00:35:35,528
你准备做什么
What you fixing to do?

761
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:37,462
你曾有过丝绒滑过的感觉吗
You ever had a velveteen rub?

762
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,899
丝绒滑过
A velveteen rub.

763
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:42,368
别用奶酪  可以吗
Ain't... Ain't no cheese involved, is there?

764
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:44,337
因为我乳糖过敏
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

765
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:52,740
来吧
Oh, yeah.

766
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:04,316
你想掐死我的小弟弟吗
You're choking my chicken!

767
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:22,110
昨晚一定和那个大胸女
That's quite a show you got going

768
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:24,145
上演了一场好戏吧  猛男
under the big top there, Sparky.

769
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:25,680
搞的我不得不在半夜
I had to take another one of them damn pills

770
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:26,975
又吃了一次那该死的药
in the middle of the night, man.

771
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:29,017
那个女人总是难以满足  我简直精疲力尽
This woman insatiable, man. I'm shooting dust.

772
00:36:31,053 --> 00:36:31,985
弗洛伊德
Oh, Floyd.

773
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:33,180
宝贝  我在这
I'm right here, baby.

774
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:34,415
你准备好了再干一场了吗
You ready for some more?

775
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:35,513
是的  来吧
Yeah, come here.

776
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:40,289
过来
Come here.

777
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:44,159
还有什么话说  小子
Think about that, boy.

778
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:46,292
我的小种马在这里哪
There's my stallion.

779
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,364
-我想要你  -你想要我吗
- I missed you. - Oh, you missed me?

780
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:52,574
你得让这里透透气
Mmm. You need a little air on this thing.

781
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,005
你这个坏孩子
Oh, you bad boy.

782
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,706
该死的
God damn.

783
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,338
你喜欢这样吗
You like that, huh?

784
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:02,007
我是你的小猫咪
I'm your little kitty cat.

785
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,387
是纯真吗
Chastity?

786
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:09,617
妈妈
Mama?

787
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:10,919
你这个小荡妇
You little whore.

788
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:12,460
你自己不也一样
You're one to talk.

789
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,927
你跟他搞得时候也把假牙拿出来了吗
Oh, did you take out your teeth for him?

790
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:16,988
注意点和你妈说话的方式
You watch how you talk to your mama.

791
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:18,657
拜托  你没资格教育我
Please, you can't talk to me like that.

792
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:19,792
你又不是我老子
You're not my daddy.

793
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:20,892
说的好  那么谁是你老子
That's right, who's your daddy?

794
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:22,095
-你是我老子  -你的大JJ老子
- You're my daddy. - Your big daddy.

795
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:24,962
洛莎莉  你在房间里吗
Rosalee, are you in there?

796
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,565
事实上  我老子在门口
Actually, that's my daddy.

797
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,271
老妈  你想什么呢
What are you thinking, Mama?

798
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:33,371
你毁了这一切
You ruined everything.

799
00:37:33,448 --> 00:37:35,507
-我恨你  -你这个乳臭未干小骚货
- I hate you.  - You little brat.

800
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:37,677
你这个肮脏的...好吧  我爱你
You're a dirty...All right, I love you.

801
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:39,277
要常给我打电话
Call me a lot of times.

802
00:37:39,354 --> 00:37:41,652
老妈  你哪根筋不对
Mama, what is wrong with you?

803
00:37:41,723 --> 00:37:43,953
我再重申一遍  你是个荡妇
I renounce you. You're a whore.

804
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:45,789
我是荡妇
I'm a whore?

805
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:48,386
你和那个黑鬼让我们全家蒙羞
You just shamed the whole family, you and the black man.

806
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,097
荡妇
Whoa!

807
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:55,033
真是太有趣了
Whoo! That was fun.

808
00:38:01,877 --> 00:38:04,937
快来  牵起我的手
So come, take me by the hand

809
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:06,947
一同离开这片烦恼之地
We'll leave this troubled land

810
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:08,573
我知道我们可以
I know we can

811
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,878
我知道我们可以
I know we can

812
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:11,146
我会下地狱的  伙计
I'll be damned, man.

813
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:12,982
那俩婊子偷了我们的钱  伙计
Them broads stole our money, man.

814
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:17,023
但那是她们应得的
but they earned it.

815
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:21,195
是我  伙计  弗洛伊德・亨德森
Yeah, man. It's Floyd Henderson, man.

816
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,423
我们出了点情况
We got a situation.

817
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:23,589
怎么了
What's the problem?

818
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,257
我的前搭档
Well, my ex-partner,

819
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,801
就是那个堕落鬼
the degenerate that he is, man,

820
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:29,928
招了几个野妓女  把我们洗劫一空

我不清楚这么做的程序是什么

歌名就叫"去你妈的低音和声"
A song called "Fuck You and Your Bass Line. "

966
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,833

奥黛特会让他屁滚尿流
Odetta would've whooped his damn ass.

You're right. I don't know nothing.

998

对  他一无所知
That's right, he don't know shit.

999

当我们没争你妈的时候
Well, when we wasn't fighting over your mother,

1014
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:02,951
唱片卖得不好

1015
00:46:03,024 --> 00:46:04,992
我们没卖出去多少

人家有自己的生活
The girl got a life.

1031
00:46:48,603 --> 00:46:49,695
她可没空
She ain't got time to be ripping,

1032
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:51,204
跟两个老黑鬼在路上颠簸
running up and down the road with two old niggers.

1033
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:52,739
为什么不能
Why not?

1034
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:55,367

路易斯
Hey, Louis.

1038
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:15,453
克里奥告诉我
You know, Cleo was telling me

1039
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,555
奥黛特从没跟她谈起过她父亲
that Odetta never told her nothing about her father,

1040
00:47:17,632 --> 00:47:19,896
名字都没提过
not even his name.

1041
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:21,731
但她提过他是个音乐家
But she did say he was a musician.

1042
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,327
你没跟那女孩瞎说八道吧
You ain't said nothing stupid to the girl, have you?

1043
00:47:23,404 --> 00:47:24,496
比如
Like what?

1044
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:27,370
比如
Oh, like, uh,

1045
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:28,670
克里奥  我是你爸爸
Cleo, you know, I'm your daddy.

1046
00:47:28,743 --> 00:47:31,405
我还要再搞清楚状况
Well, I'm still feeling out the situation.

1047
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:32,741
那你他妈干吗说
What the fuck was that

1048
00:47:32,814 --> 00:47:34,441
你应该跟我们去孟斐斯啊
that "You ought to come to Memphis with us" shit?

1049
00:47:34,516 --> 00:47:37,849
那样说  会种下祸根
Now that, right there, that's a recipe for disaster.

1050
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:41,184
路易斯  路易斯  我知道你肯定很难过
Louis, Louis, I know this ain't easy for you.

1051
00:47:41,256 --> 00:47:43,724
但是我从没想过我有孩子
But I never thought I'd have a child.

1052
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,588
现在我也开始生生不息了
Now I'm part of this big old circle called life.

1053
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,654
弗洛伊德・亨德森也许真有子孙后代
A piece of Floyd Henderson, man, might be here to live on,

1054
00:47:50,732 --> 00:47:52,165
也许会永传万代
and maybe forever.

1055
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:54,098
再不闭嘴睡觉
If you don't shut up and go to sleep,

1056
00:47:54,168 --> 00:47:55,492
混蛋弗洛伊德・亨德森
A big piece of Floyd Henderson ass 

1057
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:56,830
可能明天就醒不了了
Might not wake up in the morning.

1058
00:47:57,605 --> 00:47:59,368
路易斯  路易斯

我很佩服你
I respect the fact that you want

1060
00:48:01,075 --> 00:48:03,475
能用怒火掩盖痛苦
to cloak your pain with your anger.

1061
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:12,376
晚安
Good night.

1062
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:21,194
这他妈是什么
Oh, hey! What the fuck is that?

1063
00:48:21,262 --> 00:48:22,320
怎么了
What's wrong?

1064
00:48:22,397 --> 00:48:23,989
你又吃了那壮阳药了
You been taking them dick pills again?

1065
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:26,431
是降低胆固醇的药  是吃了
I though it was my cholesterol meds, I swear I did.

1066
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,765
你也不能沉迷于那玩意啊
You can't be spooning with a motherfucker with that!

1067
00:48:28,836 --> 00:48:29,996
你什么毛病啊
What's wrong with you?

1068
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:32,596

- Uh, I... - Nasty son of a bitch!

1069

Give me some covers. I'm gonna sleep on the floor.

1070
00:48:34,242 --> 00:48:35,300
混蛋
Shit.

1071
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:36,900
去吧  地上睡吧
Go on, then. Sleep on the floor.

1072
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:38,036
谁也不喜欢你  路易斯
Nobody wants you, Louis.

1073
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:40,012
我也不喜欢娘娘腔
I don't like boy pussy no way.

1074
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:41,548
疼死你的背
I hope your back hurt like a motherfucker.

1075
00:48:41,616 --> 00:48:44,050
起码背疼比被戳屁眼好
Better my back than my asshole.

1076
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:46,211

1077
00:48:46,287 --> 00:48:48,187
我在监狱呆那么多年
All them years I spent in prison,

1078
00:48:48,256 --> 00:48:50,190
没人敢对我这样

1079
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:51,850
我正想问你
I was going to ask you about that.

1080
00:48:51,926 --> 00:48:54,224
你真该惭愧得要死
You ought to be ashamed of your goddamn self,

1081
00:48:54,295 --> 00:48:55,728
恶心的混蛋
nasty son of a bitch.

1082
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:16,473
好似我从未有
Like I never had

1083
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:26,226
当我伤心时
When I'm feeling bad

我才是拿着枪的

1180
00:54:00,668 --> 00:54:02,101
要是我逮到他

1181
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:04,865
我要整死他  你知道的
I'd have fucked his shit up entirely, and you know that.

为什么  伙计  我在孟菲斯
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

1229
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,931
我要住在皮博迪
I want to stay at the Peabody.

1230
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:16,561
当然  先生  您之前住过这儿
Yes, sir, I understand you've stayed with us before,

1231
00:56:16,637 --> 00:56:18,036
可这就是问题所在
and apparently, that's the problem.

1232
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:20,369
似乎上次您住这儿的时候
It seems that the last time you stayed here...

1233
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:23,604
准确说是1978年3月12日
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

1234
00:56:23,678 --> 00:56:26,647
您办了个聚会  期间  您住的房间
you hosted a party, during which the room

1235
00:56:26,714 --> 00:56:28,579
以及酒店的几个其他地方
and several other areas of the hotel

1236
00:56:28,649 --> 00:56:30,981
遭到了大面积的破坏
sustained extensive damage.

1237
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:33,213
我怎么不记得这回事儿
I don't recollect nothing like that.

1238
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:35,152
我想是斯莱和布特西
I think that's the night Sly and Bootsy

1239
00:56:35,222 --> 00:56:36,780
带吞火魔术师来的那个晚上
came by with the fire-eater.

1240
00:56:36,857 --> 00:56:39,189
是玩蛇的那个人
Is that the one with the snake?

1241
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,194
就是他
That's the one.

1242
00:56:41,262 --> 00:56:43,093
也许你可以用路易斯・海因兹的名字
Perhaps you could put those rooms

1243
00:56:43,093 --> 00:56:44,925
订房看看
in the name of Louis Hinds.

1244
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:46,261
没错
Yeah, perhaps.

1245
00:56:46,334 --> 00:56:48,359
路易斯・海因兹  我们试试看
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

1246
00:56:55,843 --> 00:56:57,777
对不起  琳达  让你看到这些了
I'm sorry you had to see that, Linda.

1247
00:56:57,845 --> 00:56:59,574
怎么啦  我看看
What's on there? Let me see that shit.

1248
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,774
我要看看到底怎么了
I want to see what's on there.

1249
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:04,647
我要四个房间  先生
I need four rooms, Don.

1250
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,653
你们最好的客房
Your best available.

1251
00:57:22,737 --> 00:57:24,227
伙计们
Oh, hey, guys.

1252
00:57:24,305 --> 00:57:26,398
裁缝给了我几件今晚的演出服
Your tailor gave me several choices for tonight.

1253
00:57:26,474 --> 00:57:28,442
他说他大约7点半到
He said he's going to stop by around 7:30.

1254
00:57:28,509 --> 00:57:29,567
那是什么
What the fuck?

1255
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:31,339
你跑去打劫花花公子商场购物了
Did you catch the sale over at the Build-A-Pimp?

1256
00:57:31,412 --> 00:57:33,573
你喜欢这个吗  很棒吧
You like that? It's fly, huh?

1257
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:36,276
这样穿很时髦
It's a get-down, get-down. It's live. It's funky.

1258
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,942
我想应该找几个保姆
And I think I'm going to get some poonanny.

1259
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:39,509
说实话
To be honest with you,

1260
00:57:39,587 --> 00:57:41,953
自从电视开播《老友记》  我就没泡过妞
I haven't been laid since Friends was on television.

1261
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,285
今晚我要好好享受
So this is my night.

1262
00:57:43,357 --> 00:57:45,917
你确定他不是你的孩子吗
You sure that ain't one of your children?

1263
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:49,958
今晚你会唱得很棒的
You gonna sing real nice tonight.

1264
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:51,191
女歌手是谁
Who's the girl singer?

1265
00:57:54,669 --> 00:57:58,127
噢  天  看啊  伙计
Oh, my goodness! Look at here! Oh, man.

1266
00:57:58,205 --> 00:57:59,331
你好  路易斯  很高兴见到你
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

1267
00:57:59,407 --> 00:58:00,499
你好吗  伙计
You good, man?

1268
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:08,774
你看起来不错
Hey, good-looking.

1269
00:58:08,849 --> 00:58:11,340
克劳德特  你好吗  小妞儿
Claudette. How you doing, girl?

1270
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:12,977
我知道你不会还在对
I know you still ain't upset

1271
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:14,351
在巴尔的摩所发生的事难过
about what happened in Baltimore that...

1272
00:58:14,422 --> 00:58:16,447
你犯什么毛病  娘们儿
Oh! What's wrong with you, woman?

1273
00:58:16,524 --> 00:58:18,924
直接下地狱去吧  弗洛伊德・亨德森
You going straight to hell, Floyd Henderson.

1274
00:58:20,461 --> 00:58:21,723
你笑什么
What you laughing at?

1275
00:58:21,796 --> 00:58:24,663
-也想来一下吗  -不
- You want some, too? - No.

1276
00:58:24,732 --> 00:58:25,699
去你妈的
Fuck you.

1277
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,062
去你妈的  去你妈的
Fuck you, fuck you

1278
00:58:29,136 --> 00:58:30,797
这下我们没有女歌手了
Now we have no girl singer.

1279
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:32,805
我们找人代替不就行了
We just got to find a replacement, that's all.

1280
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:34,033
时间不够了
It's too late.

1281
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:36,338
克里奥
Cleo.

1282
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,207
你会唱我们所有的歌  对吧
You know all our songs, right?

1283
00:58:38,279 --> 00:58:41,180
别介意我直说  伙计
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

1284
00:58:41,248 --> 00:58:42,909
我不和不入流的票友一起演出
but I'm not playing with no rank amateur.

1285
00:58:42,983 --> 00:58:45,315
别这样  沃夫曼  她不是不入流的票友
Come on, Wolfman, this ain't no rank amateur, man.

1286
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:47,047
伙计  她是奥黛特・惠特菲尔德的女儿
This Odetta Whitfield's daughter, man.

1287
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:48,247
还没出名而以
Ain't got to recognize.

1288
00:58:48,322 --> 00:58:50,813
真是的  那我们开始吧  宝贝
Shit. Let's roll, then, baby.

1289
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,358
她会唱歌吧
She can sing, can't she?

1290
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:09,599
我们开始
Here we go.

1291
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:19,084
如果音乐让你起舞
If music makes you move

1292
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:21,519
你就尽情享受
You can really groove

1293
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:28,058
享受
Groove on

1294
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:31,145
如果你真的想热恋
If you feel like you want to make love

1295
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:34,162
就在满天繁星下

1296
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:36,169
热恋
Love on

如果你真的有话要说
If there's something that you wanna say

1299
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:46,837
却又找不到出路
And talking is the hard way

1300
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:53,779
说唱
Rap on

1301
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:58,853
因为无论是什么  只要你想做
'Cause whatever you want to do

1302
00:59:58,926 --> 01:00:02,362
你就应该勇往直前
You got to do your thing

1303
01:00:07,735 --> 01:00:09,327
如果你真的想呐喊
If you feel like you want to scream

1304
01:00:10,571 --> 01:00:12,505
如果这是你怒气在释放
If that's your way you let off steam

1305
01:00:12,573 --> 01:00:14,063
呐喊

1308
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:25,349
因为唱歌就是你所想

1309
01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:27,387
歌唱
Sing on

歌唱
Sing on

1311
01:00:32,459 --> 01:00:35,087
如果你想整夜都热恋

1312
01:00:35,162 --> 01:00:38,859
因为你感觉很棒

你就应该勇往直前
You got to do your thing

1317
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,551
我是这乐队的  是的  这是一支梦幻般的乐队
I'm with the band. Yeah, it's a dream.

1318
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:07,617

我弹哈姆菲卡
I play the harmuffica.

1320
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:16,731
我帮你看着位子
I'll save you a seat.

1321
01:01:16,804 --> 01:01:23,304
因为无论是什么  只要你想做
'Cause whatever you want to do

1322
01:01:23,377 --> 01:01:27,746
太棒啦  宝贝儿

你就应该勇往直前
You got to do your thing

1324
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,367
今晚是我一生中最疯狂的一晚
This is the most insane night of my life.

1325
01:01:56,443 --> 01:01:58,240
艾萨克想让我去他的工作室
You know Isaac wants to put me in his studio?

1326
01:01:58,312 --> 01:02:01,645
他说他有一首歌非常适合我唱
He says he's got a song that'd be perfect for me.

1327
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:03,683
噢  真的吗
Oh, he does, does he?

1328
01:02:03,751 --> 01:02:07,050
别这样  不是你想的那样
Uh... Come on, now. It ain't like that.

1329
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:08,884
总会是那样的
Oh, it's always like that,

1330
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:10,446
就像电影里演的
like movies.

1331
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:14,393
好吧  我会小心点的
Well, I'll be careful.

1332
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:17,191
只是担心你而已  没别的
Just trying to look out for you, that's all.

1333
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:22,396
谢谢你们为我做的一切
Thanks, guys, for everything.

1334
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:28,572
你就应该勇往直前

Right on

1339
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:47,325
伙计  这不是正拳组合的车吗
Man, ain't that the Real Deal car?

1340
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:49,521
那当然  朋友  你是歌迷
Sure is, homie. You a fan?

1341
01:02:51,732 --> 01:02:55,133
是的  我是超级歌迷
Hell, yeah. I'm a big fan.

1342
01:02:55,202 --> 01:02:56,726
你知道他们在哪儿吗
You know where they at?

1343
01:02:56,804 --> 01:02:58,237
因为我要找他们诉诉苦
'Cause I need to holler at 'em.

1344
01:02:58,305 --> 01:03:01,741
说实话我是他们的经纪人
Actually, I'm their manager.

1345
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:05,074
真的  他们的经纪人
Really? Their manager?

1346
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:11,649
等一下
Hold on a minute.

1347
01:03:15,022 --> 01:03:17,047
弗洛伊德
Oh, hi, Floyd.

1348
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:19,183
进来吧  看看这地方
Come on in. Check this place out.

1349
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:20,487
我会习惯上这里的
I could get used to this.

1350
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:21,926
我肯定你会的
I'll bet you could.

1351
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:23,156
喝一杯吧
Let me get you a drink.

1352
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,356
好的  给我来一杯
Yeah, I'll take one.

1353
01:03:24,431 --> 01:03:25,693
等等  先别去倒酒
But hold on, before you do that,

1354
01:03:25,766 --> 01:03:27,358
有件事想和你说
there's something I want to say to you.

1355
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:29,334
是让你吃惊的事情
It's been a blast connecting with you.

1356
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:30,665
我想你该知道这件事
I want you to know that.

1357
01:03:30,738 --> 01:03:32,171
你真好
That's sweet of you.

1358
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:33,501
如果你有什么需要
And if you need anything,

1359
01:03:33,574 --> 01:03:34,768
比如钱什么的
like money or something like that,

1360
01:03:34,842 --> 01:03:37,606
直接告诉我
don't you hesitate to call me now.

1361
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:38,707
不是因为钱能弥补
Not that money gonna make up for

1362
01:03:38,707 --> 01:03:39,737
我们没有在一起的日子
the lost time between us

1363
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:41,280
或是别的什么
or nothing like that.

1364
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:42,610
逝去的日子
Lost time?

1365
01:03:42,683 --> 01:03:43,707
你要理解
You have to understand,

1366
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:46,878
奥黛特从来没有告诉过我有关你的事
Odetta never told me nothing about you.

1367
01:03:46,954 --> 01:03:48,717
如果我一开始就知道有你
Had I known about you from the beginning,

1368
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:50,051
我会在你身边的
I'd have been here from the start.

1369
01:03:50,124 --> 01:03:51,386
-弗洛伊德  -她从没向我提过你的事
- Floyd... - She never said nothing to me about you.

1370
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:52,720
弗洛伊德  你不是我父亲
You're not my father, Floyd.

1371
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:54,226
你没在听我说
You're not listening.

1372
01:03:54,294 --> 01:03:55,886
你的事  什么  你说什么
See, the thing you... what's that? Say what?

1373
01:03:55,963 --> 01:03:57,521
你不是我父亲
You're not my father.

1374
01:03:57,598 --> 01:03:59,327
我不是
I- I'm not?

1375
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,697
你不是
No.

1376
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:02,360
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1377
01:04:02,436 --> 01:04:04,734
因为我父亲知道我
Because he knows who I am

1378
01:04:04,805 --> 01:04:06,295
或者他曾经知道我
Or he did.

1379
01:04:06,373 --> 01:04:07,635
我是说  就我所知
I mean, for all I know,

1380
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,936
他可能已经死了
he could be dead.

1381
01:04:10,377 --> 01:04:13,346
每过一段时间   他会寄钱给我
I get a little money from him every once in a while.

1382
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:16,144
是他许多年前设立的保密委托
It's a blind trust he set up years ago.

1383
01:04:16,216 --> 01:04:18,343
钱从他的音乐版税来
Something to do with his music royalties.

1384
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:21,149
音乐版税
Music royalties?

1385
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:27,893
你上了我老婆  你这混账东西
You knocked up my wife, motherfucker.

1386
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:31,089
你先从我这偷走她的
Ooh. You stole her from me first.

1387
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:33,030
你发什么疯
What is wrong with you?

1388
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:36,032
你失去了你的...
You lost your...

1389
01:04:36,103 --> 01:04:37,536
你没和克里奥说吧
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

1390
01:04:37,604 --> 01:04:39,037
没有  我没告诉她
No, I didn't tell her.

1391
01:04:39,106 --> 01:04:40,437
虽然我应该告诉她
I should've told her, though.

1392
01:04:40,507 --> 01:04:42,771
你一定笑翻了吧
I'll bet you laughing your ass off, wasn't you?

1393
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:44,310
四处散布说我才是那女孩的父亲
Going around, talking about I'm the girl's daddy

1394
01:04:44,378 --> 01:04:47,211
还有生生不息之类的废话
and big round circle of life, all that bullshit.

1395
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:48,714
笑吧  笑吧  混账东西
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

1396
01:04:48,782 --> 01:04:50,443
就那么一点点
Well, just a little bit.

1397
01:04:52,386 --> 01:04:53,717
弗洛伊德
Floyd...

1398
01:04:53,787 --> 01:04:55,550
听着  弗洛伊德
Look, Floyd...

1399
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:56,816
弗洛伊德  放下  放下
Floyd, put it down. Put it down!

1400
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:59,484
兄弟  别这样
Dawg, come on!

1401
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,152
住手  不然你会受伤的
You need to quit before you get hurt.

1402
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:06,832
听着  弗洛伊德
Look, Floyd,

1403
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,834
我不是故意的  行了吧
I didn't mean for it to happen, all right?

1404
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:10,199
你知道她是什么人
You know how she was.

1405
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:13,600
拉我一把
Come here.

1406
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:15,232
好了  伙计  别再犯傻了
Come on, man. Stop acting a fool.

1407
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:17,701
你没事吧
You all right?

1408
01:05:17,778 --> 01:05:19,712
混蛋  别再犯傻了
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

1409
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:26,110
去你大爷的
Fucking dad!

1410
01:05:26,186 --> 01:05:28,746
你他妈的又什么不对了
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1411
01:05:49,543 --> 01:05:53,141
暂停
Time out.

1412
01:05:57,017 --> 01:05:59,349
伙计  尝到我那一拳的利害了吧
Still got a little pop in your punch there, partner.

1413
01:05:59,419 --> 01:06:01,546
尝尝这一拳  混账
Pop this, motherfucker!

1414
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:06,792
混蛋
Shit. Ugh.

1415
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:10,095
你这个混账东西居然打我的蛋蛋
You dirty motherfucker, hitting me in the nuts.

1416
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:12,462
混蛋
Ooh! Shit.

1417
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:16,401
路易斯  不可能一直是你扁我
Louis, you just can't keep whooping on my ass.

1418
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:18,563
我也是他妈的男子汉  宝贝
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

1419
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:20,163
我也是他妈的男子汉
I'm a motherfucking man.

1420
01:06:23,277 --> 01:06:26,371
路易斯  你怎么能不去看你女儿呢
Louis, how come you won't see your own daughter?

1421
01:06:26,472 --> 01:06:28,463
混蛋  我想去看她
Oh, motherfucker, I wanted to see her,

1422
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:31,032
但是
but, you know...

1423
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:34,011
是时机  过一段时间以后
It's time... After a while,

1424
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,106
就变得  就变得难以承受
you know, it's just... it's just too much.

1425
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,946
奥黛特为什么不告诉她
Why didn't O tell her?

1426
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:40,543
伙计  奥黛特为什么不告诉她
Why didn't Odetta tell her, man?

1427
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,554
让她说什么
What was she going to tell her, huh?

1428
01:06:42,622 --> 01:06:46,319
说她父亲是个又酗酒又吸毒的人渣
That her daddy was a alcoholic dopehead convict

1429
01:06:46,392 --> 01:06:48,724
说她父亲一事无成
that fucked up everything he touched, hmm?

1430
01:06:48,794 --> 01:06:49,886
不行  不行
No, no.

1431
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:51,793
没有我她过得更好
She was better off without me.

1432
01:06:51,864 --> 01:06:53,331
混蛋
Oh, shit.

1433
01:06:53,399 --> 01:06:54,457
不管怎样  一切都太晚了
Anyhow, it's too late now.

1434
01:06:55,635 --> 01:06:58,126
遇见她是个错误
It was a mistake getting to know her.

1435
01:06:58,204 --> 01:06:59,865
-路  -怎么啦

1436
01:06:59,939 --> 01:07:01,304
你怎么了  发病了
What is wrong with you? You having a seizure?

1437
01:07:01,374 --> 01:07:03,672

你真的在音乐圈工作
You really in the music business?

1447
01:07:23,496 --> 01:07:24,588
干吗  你有带子需要混音
Why, do you have a mix tape?

1448
01:07:24,664 --> 01:07:26,154
你他妈的给我闭嘴  白小子
Shut the fuck up, white boy!

1449
01:07:26,232 --> 01:07:28,564
还有别再流那么多汗
And stop sweating so goddamn much.

1450
01:07:28,634 --> 01:07:30,158
你闻起来像腊肉
You smell like bacon.

1451
01:07:30,236 --> 01:07:32,170
而我吃素
And I'm a Muslim on Saturdays.

1452
01:07:32,238 --> 01:07:34,229
你哪根筋不对
Fucking wrong with you, huh?

1453
01:07:34,307 --> 01:07:36,434
明明是白人却留非洲人的头发
How you white and got a afro?

1454
01:07:36,441 --> 01:07:38,466
一点儿也不帅
That ain't cool.

1455
01:07:38,543 --> 01:07:39,805
该死的  我头疼

01:09:41,741 --> 01:09:43,299
弄的我浑身发痒
man, got me itching.

1503
01:09:44,611 --> 01:09:46,943
看守
Yo, turnkey!

1504
01:09:47,013 --> 01:09:48,708
快点放我出去
Come on and let me out of this motherfucker!

1505
01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:51,046
你应该面对现实
You might want to wrap your mind around the fact

1506
01:09:51,117 --> 01:09:52,243
现实就是我们要错过演出了
that we're gonna miss that show.

1507
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,048
你他妈说什么  伙计
Fuck you talking about, man?

1508
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,748
明晚我们一定要到纽约
We gotta be in New York tomorrow night.

1509
01:09:56,823 --> 01:09:58,586
不包括我
Uh-uh. Not me.

1510
01:09:58,658 --> 01:09:59,886
我受够了  精疲力竭
I've had enough. I'm done.

1511
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,985
什么  你要丢下我一个人  路易斯
What, you're walking out on me, Louis?

1512
01:10:02,062 --> 01:10:04,360
听着  佛洛德  在你到我家之前
Look, Floyd, I was doing just fine

1513
01:10:04,431 --> 01:10:05,728
我还好好的
before you showed up at my door.

1514
01:10:05,799 --> 01:10:07,096
你应该感谢我
That's the thanks I get

1515
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:08,634
把你从破老鼠洞里救出来
for pulling you out of that fucking rat hole.

1516
01:10:08,702 --> 01:10:09,964
你本来应该坐在那儿
You was just sitting up in there,

1517
01:10:10,036 --> 01:10:11,230
坐在那儿等死
just sitting there waiting to die.

1518
01:10:11,304 --> 01:10:12,430
拜托  黑鬼
Negro, please.

1519
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:14,097
你比我好不到哪去
You ain't no different from me,

1520
01:10:14,174 --> 01:10:16,802
你侄子把你这老年痴呆赶走
Especially since your nephew put your senile ass out to pasture

1521
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:18,037
还抢了你生意
and stole your business.

1522
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,942
混蛋  路易斯
Fuck you, Louis.

1523
01:10:20,013 --> 01:10:23,073
快滚回你的破老鼠洞吧
Crawl back under that damn rock you've been living.

1524
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:24,673
我不需要你
I don't need you.

1525
01:10:24,751 --> 01:10:26,776
我自己能搞定
I'll do this shit by my damn self.

1526
01:10:26,853 --> 01:10:30,345
看守
Yo! Turnkey!

1527
01:10:30,423 --> 01:10:32,186
让我从这个鬼地方出去
Come on and let me out of this motherfucker.

1528
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:34,022
我受够了  我要见律师
I've had enough, man. I want my lawyer.

1529
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:35,118
放松  放松
Relax, relax.

1530
01:10:35,195 --> 01:10:37,129
你不需要律师了
You ain't gonna need no lawyer.

1531
01:10:37,197 --> 01:10:39,324
目击者证实了你的说辞
Witnesses say your story checks out,

1532
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:42,129
所以  先生  你可以走了
so you, sir, are good to go.

1533
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:45,603
太好了
Yeah.

1534
01:10:45,672 --> 01:10:48,140
等等  摇滚小子
Whoa. Hold on there, Chuck Berry.

1535
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:50,438
你可能需要请个律师
You're gonna need a lawyer.

1536
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:54,241
你越过州界违反了假释条款
Seems crossing state lines is in violation of his parole,

1537
01:10:54,314 --> 01:10:56,282
更别说持有枪支
Not to mention possession of firearms

1538
01:10:56,349 --> 01:10:57,646
和无照驾驶
and driving without a license.

1539
01:10:57,717 --> 01:10:58,775
无照
No license?

1540
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,282
借一步说话
Step back for a minute.

1541
01:11:03,056 --> 01:11:05,456
希望你烂死在这儿
I hope your ass rot up in here,

1542
01:11:05,525 --> 01:11:07,493
你他妈的罪有应得
you criminal-bound motherfucker, you.

1543
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,725
老子曰  "不欲以静  天下将自定"
As Lao-Tzu says, "Let things flow forward as they may. "

1544
01:11:12,799 --> 01:11:15,131
那我就顺其自然了  宝贝
And I'm gonna let it flow, too, baby.

1545
01:11:15,201 --> 01:11:19,399
我也给你点亚非后裔哲学  朋友
And I got some Blackanese philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

1546
01:11:19,472 --> 01:11:21,963
你能蒙混  但是没法逃脱  路
You get by, Lou, but you don't get away.

1547
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:24,306
黄泥巴掉到裤裆里  不是屎也是屎
You sit in shit, you start to smell like it,

1548
01:11:24,377 --> 01:11:25,935
所以自己小心别沾上
so check the crack of your ass.

1549
01:11:26,012 --> 01:11:28,173
还有些东西给你
Here's something else for you.

1550
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:30,375
这是她的号码
Here go her number.

1551
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:33,943
给她打电话吧  老爸
Call her... Daddy.

1552
01:11:35,622 --> 01:11:36,850
去死吧
Fuck him, man!

1553
01:11:36,923 --> 01:11:38,686
我得快点离开这个鬼地方
Let's get on out of this motherfucker.

1554
01:11:38,758 --> 01:11:41,090
他啥也不是
He ain't worth two damn flies smashed.

1555
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:44,488
这个黑鬼
Nigger.

1556
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:08,253
我能打个电话吗
Can I make a phone call?

1557
01:12:24,004 --> 01:12:26,199
你要丢下我一个人  路易斯
You walking out on me, Louis?

1558
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:27,637
我受够了  精疲力尽
I've had enough. I'm done.

1559
01:12:27,707 --> 01:12:29,174
你没事吧  伙计
You all right, man?

1560
01:12:29,242 --> 01:12:30,732
是的  是的  我很好
Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.

1561
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,368
你一点也不好  呼吸都困难
You're not all right. You can't hardly breathe.

1562
01:12:32,445 --> 01:12:34,345
你需要做胸部X光检查
You need a chest X-ray.

1563
01:12:34,414 --> 01:12:36,609
我不想复出
I ain't trying to make no comeback.

1564
01:12:36,683 --> 01:12:38,275
我已经离开  就不想回去
I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.

1565
01:12:38,351 --> 01:12:39,648
你应该感谢我
That's the thanks I get

1566
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:40,981
把你从破老鼠洞里救出来
for pulling you out of that rat hole,

1567
01:12:41,054 --> 01:12:42,180
坐在那等死
just sitting there waiting to die...

1568
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:43,847
坐在那等死
sitting there waiting to die...

1569
01:12:43,923 --> 01:12:45,481
- 死  死  - 太晚了
- die, die...  - It's too late.

1570
01:12:45,558 --> 01:12:47,219
在座的有医生吗
Is there a doctor in the house?

1571
01:12:49,229 --> 01:12:51,595
抓紧时间
Keep it short.

1572
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:55,896
我是克里奥  请留言
It's Cleo. Please leave a message.

1573
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:03,373
克里奥  我是路易斯
Cleo... um, this is, uh, Louis.

1574
01:13:03,443 --> 01:13:05,343
路易斯・海因兹
Louis Hinds.

1575
01:13:05,412 --> 01:13:06,777
你父亲
Your father.

1576
01:13:08,048 --> 01:13:10,915
这么说有点奇怪
Wow, um, feels funny saying that.

1577
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:13,145
我以前从没这么说过
I've, um, I've never said it before.

1578
01:13:15,021 --> 01:13:16,488
听着
Listen.

1579
01:13:18,525 --> 01:13:20,720
我没别的意思
I didn't mean what I said.

1580
01:13:20,794 --> 01:13:22,159
我只是
I was...

1581
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:28,601
奥黛塔是我生命中的最爱
Odetta was the love of my life.

1582
01:13:28,668 --> 01:13:30,465
对我来说最糟糕的
The worst thing that ever happened to me

1583
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:34,268
就是失去你们
was losing her and you.

1584
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,671
但是你现在这么优秀
But you turned out great.

1585
01:13:35,742 --> 01:13:39,007
她把你教育得很好
She did a wonderful job with you.

1586
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,843
你妈妈是个了不起的女人
You know your mother was an amazing woman.

1587
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:43,439
我只想告诉你
And I just want you to know

1588
01:13:43,516 --> 01:13:48,579
我非常  非常高兴见到你
I'm really, really glad I met you.

1589
01:13:48,655 --> 01:13:49,747
我希望我
And I wish I...

1590
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:01,332
好啦
All right.

1591
01:14:09,843 --> 01:14:12,573
你他妈的知道自己在干什么吗
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1592
01:14:13,646 --> 01:14:15,136
把你救出监狱
Busting your ass out of jail.

1593
01:14:15,215 --> 01:14:17,445
你看我像在干什么
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?

1594
01:14:17,517 --> 01:14:18,848
后退  宅男  把钥匙拿出来
Back up, Red. Get your keys out.

1595
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:19,907
打开牢门  懂吗
Open that cell, okay?

1596
01:14:19,986 --> 01:14:21,112
长官  别听他的
Deputy, don't listen to him.

1597
01:14:21,187 --> 01:14:23,553
他不会开枪的  至少打不中
He will not shoot you. Not on purpose anyway.

1598
01:14:23,623 --> 01:14:26,091
别被他骗了  宅男
Don't let him get you fucked up, Red.

1599
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,592
我会毫不犹豫地开枪
I'll kill you disco-dead.

1600
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,890
打开牢门  先生
Now open that doggone cell, man.

1601
01:14:29,963 --> 01:14:32,193
别抖  否则我也会抖
Stop shaking. If you shake, I'm gonna start shaking.

1602
01:14:32,265 --> 01:14:33,562
接下来你知道怎么做
Next thing you know, kapow!

1603
01:14:33,633 --> 01:14:34,861
进去
Go on in.

1604
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:35,992
现在把钥匙给他
Now hand him the keys.

1605
01:14:36,069 --> 01:14:37,764
快给他
Hand them to him.

1606
01:14:37,837 --> 01:14:39,270
-好了吗  -弗洛伊德
- Okay?  - Floyd.

1607
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:41,000
你真的要这么做
You sure you want to do this?

1608
01:14:41,074 --> 01:14:43,542
是不是每件事都要跟我争
Does everything gotta be a fucking argument with you?

1609
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:44,975
该死的  快出来
God damn! Come on out of there!

1610
01:14:45,044 --> 01:14:46,944
关门  路  锁上
Close the door, Lou. Lock it up.

1611
01:14:47,013 --> 01:14:49,345
我是人质
I'm a hostage.

1612
01:14:49,415 --> 01:14:50,814
如果你不他妈的闭嘴
You're gonna be a dead hostage

1613
01:14:50,884 --> 01:14:52,010
你就将变成死人质
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1614
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,181
看这里  宅男
Now look here, Red.

1615
01:14:55,255 --> 01:14:56,813
总的来说  我欣赏你
I like you, almost.

1616
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:59,791
打电话给除了老妈以外的人  就是找死
You call anybody outside your mama, kapow.

1617
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:01,349
明白吗
Okay?

1618
01:15:02,195 --> 01:15:03,526
咱们走吧
Let's get out of here.

1619
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:07,397
有人跟踪吗  伙计
Anybody following us, man?

1620
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:08,525
目前没有
Not yet.

1621
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:11,035
不过我打赌马上会有
But you can bet your ass they will be.

1622
01:15:11,104 --> 01:15:12,298
路  我们得弃车逃跑  伙计
Lou, we gotta dump the Mothership, man.

1623
01:15:12,372 --> 01:15:13,532
我们得弃车
We gotta dump it.

1624
01:15:13,606 --> 01:15:15,073
你能丢下你的爱车
You'd abandon the Mothership?

1625
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:16,506
从法律上来说我们是逃犯
We're fugitives from the law.

1626
01:15:16,576 --> 01:15:18,510
我们的按逃犯的思路考虑问题
We gotta start thinking like it.

1627
01:15:18,578 --> 01:15:20,876
逃犯不是我们
We're not fugitives, O.J.

1628
01:15:20,947 --> 01:15:23,211
而是你  我是人质
You're a fugitive. I'm a hostage.

1629
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:25,080
这是我的说辞  而且我会坚持
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

1630
01:15:29,923 --> 01:15:30,981
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

1631
01:15:31,057 --> 01:15:32,581
看  看  看
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1632
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:34,684
看那边  伙计
Look at that right there, man.

1633
01:15:34,761 --> 01:15:37,025
那不是莱斯特的车吗
Ain't that Lester's car?

1634
01:15:37,096 --> 01:15:39,030
混蛋
Motherfuckers.

1635
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,277
我们饿了  伙计  
We're hungry, man. 

1636
01:15:45,278 --> 01:15:47,058
来点烤鸡什么的
Come up with some baked chicken or something.

1637
01:15:53,746 --> 01:15:54,713
他们又开始了
They're at it again.

1638
01:15:58,952 --> 01:16:01,443
该死的  莱斯特的车

海因兹先生  亨德森先生

我的天啊

1645
01:16:27,146 --> 01:16:30,582
你都不知道  里面有多热

1646

如果有什么我能帮忙

请你能拉我一把

1651
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:40,819
我被关在这儿
I've been locked in there,

1652
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:42,690
他们还整天开着低音喇叭
and they've had the woofers going all day.

1653
01:16:42,762 --> 01:16:44,320
天啊
Oh, my God.

1654
01:16:44,397 --> 01:16:46,763
我得去撒尿  如果你不介意
I just have to pee real bad, so if you don't mind.

1655
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:47,891
看见你们太好了
It's so good to see you.

1656
01:16:47,967 --> 01:16:49,798
海因兹先生

1675
01:17:31,778 --> 01:17:33,507

-没有搞错吧  -在听吗
- Are you kidding me? - Hello?

1683
01:17:46,392 --> 01:17:47,620
该死的你在哪
Where the hell are you?

1684
01:17:47,694 --> 01:17:49,491
听着  我打电话来是要告诉你
Listen, I called because I just wanted to let you know

1685
01:17:49,562 --> 01:17:52,030
一切都很好  都在我们掌控中
that everything's cool, and we're still on target.

1686
01:17:52,098 --> 01:17:53,326
我们
We?

1687
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:55,060
你跟亨德森和海因兹在一起吗
You're with Henderson and Hinds?

1688
01:17:55,134 --> 01:17:56,158
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

1689
01:17:56,235 --> 01:17:57,725
虽然他们总是说"混蛋"
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

1690
01:17:57,804 --> 01:17:59,066
但他们都是好人
but they're really good guys.

1691
01:17:59,138 --> 01:18:00,628
好吧  很好
All right, well, good.

1692
01:18:00,707 --> 01:18:02,038
你告诉他们
You can give them this message.

1693
01:18:02,108 --> 01:18:03,837
电视网那边刚打电话来  他们不能出席演出
The network just called, and they're off the show.

1694
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,537
他们不能这么做
But they can't do that!

1695
01:18:05,611 --> 01:18:07,340
哦  是吗  那可是VH1频道
Oh, really? It's VH1.

1696
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:08,846
你看过爱的滋味吗
Have you seen Flava of Love?

1697
01:18:08,915 --> 01:18:10,815
他们可以为所欲为
They can pretty much do whatever they want.

1698
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:13,078
还有  你被开除了
And another thing, you're fired.

1699
01:18:13,152 --> 01:18:16,178
混蛋  去死吧
Motherfucker! What the fuck?

1700
01:18:24,864 --> 01:18:25,694
他怎么说
What'd he say?

1701
01:18:27,133 --> 01:18:29,863
他说我被开除了
Uh, he said I'm fired,

1702
01:18:29,936 --> 01:18:34,396
还有  还有  你们不能出席活动
and... and, uh, and you're off the show.

1703
01:18:41,414 --> 01:18:43,143
你  你说真的  伙计
Are... Are you serious, man?

1704
01:18:44,484 --> 01:18:46,076
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1705
01:19:30,363 --> 01:19:32,991
根据地图来看
You know, uh, according to the map,

1706
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:36,262
那条路通向高速公路
that road leads to the turnpike.

1707
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:37,962
我们仍有时间完成
I think we've still got time to make it.

1708
01:19:38,037 --> 01:19:40,597
完成什么  路易斯
Make what, Louis?

1709
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:42,538
你听见那个混蛋怎么说的
You heard what the motherfucker said!

1710
01:19:42,608 --> 01:19:43,666
都结束了
It's over!

1711
01:19:43,743 --> 01:19:45,176
去他妈的
Fuck that.

1712
01:19:49,315 --> 01:19:53,615
我们说结束才是真的结束了  明白吗
This shit ain't over till we say it's over, all right?

1713
01:19:55,888 --> 01:19:57,287
一切都不同了
Things have changed,

1714
01:19:57,356 --> 01:20:01,417
我精神上有了新的领悟
and I have achieved a state of mental clarity.

1715
01:20:01,494 --> 01:20:02,722
说的太好了
Ain't that a bitch?

1716
01:20:02,795 --> 01:20:04,023
你听见那个混蛋的话了吗
You hear what this motherfucker said?

1717
01:20:04,096 --> 01:20:06,894
伙计  从我敲你家门开始
Ever since I knocked on your door, man,

1718
01:20:06,966 --> 01:20:09,161
你就一直反对我
you've been beating my balls at every fucking turn.

1719
01:20:09,235 --> 01:20:12,898
现在突然间有领悟了
Now all of a sudden, you've got a state of clarity.

1720
01:20:12,972 --> 01:20:14,701
你的领悟从洛杉矶来的  路
Where was your clarity in L.A., Lou?

1721
01:20:14,774 --> 01:20:16,264
你不能只像订匹萨一样
You can't just dial that shit up

1722
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:18,606
打个电话  混蛋
like you calling for a pizza, motherfucker.

1723
01:20:18,678 --> 01:20:21,511
一定要深入  干实事
You got to go inside, do the work.

1724
01:20:21,581 --> 01:20:24,175
因此  我承认
Consequently, I have a confession.

1725
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:29,952
弗洛伊德  你是对的
Floyd, you were right about me.

1726
01:20:30,022 --> 01:20:34,015
我放弃了生命中很多事情
I have given up on a lot of things in my life.

1727
01:20:34,093 --> 01:20:36,561
但这次我不想放弃  行吗
But I ain't giving up on this. All right?

1728
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:40,429
来吧  伙计  我们过去几天经历了那么多烂事
Come on, man, we've been through enough shit the last few days.

1729
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,899
我们这次也可以挺过去
We can do this.

1730
01:20:41,968 --> 01:20:44,698
没人敢阻止我们
And I dare anybody to try to stop us.

1731
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,738
出发  混蛋
Let's go, motherfucker.

1732
01:20:46,806 --> 01:20:47,932
枪
Shotgun.

1733
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:50,799
坐后面去
Get your ass in the backseat.

1734
01:20:51,043 --> 01:20:53,876
无法再阻止我们
Ain't no stoppin' us now

1735
01:20:53,946 --> 01:20:55,743
我们踏上征程
We're on the move

1736
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:02,988
曾有许多事让我们停滞
There's been so many things that's held us down

1737
01:21:03,055 --> 01:21:04,886
但是现在看来
But now it looks

1738
01:21:04,957 --> 01:21:07,790
一切都能克服
Like things are finally coming around

1739
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:13,097
千万别失望  失望
Don't you let nothing, nothing

1740
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:17,158
坚定不移
Stand in your way

1741
01:21:17,236 --> 01:21:21,036
我要你倾听  倾听
I want y'all to listen, listen

1742
01:21:21,107 --> 01:21:24,634
我说的每个字  每个字
To every word I say, every word I say

1743
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,178
无法再阻止我们
Ain't no stopping us now

1744
01:21:27,246 --> 01:21:28,611
没有  没有
No, no, no

1745
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:30,148
我们踏上征程
We're on the move

1746
01:21:30,216 --> 01:21:33,481
路途奇妙
The movin' groovin'

1747
01:21:33,553 --> 01:21:35,919
无法再阻止我们
Ain't no stopping us now

1748
01:21:35,988 --> 01:21:37,922
音效和地板放射性监测器都打开  懂吗
Full sound and switch on all the floor monitors, all right?

1749
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:40,151
看那个  那个很管用很敏感
Look at that. That's nice and subtle.

1750
01:21:40,226 --> 01:21:41,352
我马上做  音效测试
I'm on it, then. Sound check.

1751
01:21:41,427 --> 01:21:42,394
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

1752
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:43,393
- 爱普斯坦先生  - 什么事?
- Mr. Epstein. - Yeah?

1753
01:21:43,462 --> 01:21:44,759
你在这太好了
Hey, thank God you're here.

1754
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:45,990
天  这怎么可能
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

1755
01:21:46,065 --> 01:21:47,896
你在这干什么  我已经开除你了
What are you doing here? I thought I fired you.

1756
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:50,128
我只想告诉你  我不是自己来的
I just wanted to tell you I'm not alone.

1757
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,740
你们都疯了
You guys are insane!

1758
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:59,437
很高兴见到你  小爱普
Good to see you, too, Little Ep.

1759
01:21:59,512 --> 01:22:01,605
这根本行不通
Yeah, this is never going to happen.

1760
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:04,377
你们一旦被认出就会被逮捕
You'll be arrested the moment the cops spot you.

1761
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,247
我们不关心那些
We don't care anything about that.

1762
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:08,253
我们只想唱自己的歌
We just want to do our song.

1763
01:22:08,321 --> 01:22:10,551
还有一件事  你有时间吗
Oh, one other thing. You got a few minutes?

1764
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:12,090
有  我占用了全世界的时间
Yeah, I got all the time in the world.

1765
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:13,785
我正在录制一个电视秀
I'm just producing a television show

1766
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:15,486
有很多音乐明星参与
with dozens of huge musical acts

1767
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:17,688
还有17分半钟就开始直播了
that goes live in 171/2 minutes,

1768
01:22:17,763 --> 01:22:19,697
但是你知道  拿些咖啡来  我们谈谈
but you know, let's grab some coffee and have a little chit-chat.

1769
01:22:25,438 --> 01:22:27,804
他得这病多长时间了
Wow. How long's he got?

1770
01:22:29,675 --> 01:22:30,767
不知道
We don't know.

1771
01:22:32,812 --> 01:22:33,801
好吧
All right.

1772
01:22:33,879 --> 01:22:35,938
我会尽力的  好吧
I'll see what I can do. Okay?

1773
01:22:36,015 --> 01:22:37,607
谢谢
Thank you.

The ceremony will begin shortly.

1777
01:22:53,065 --> 01:22:54,532

1778
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:01,406
黑人摩西
The Black Moses.

1779
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:03,508
你怎么样  伙计
How's it going, man?

1780

Hey, what's happening?

1781
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:05,676
你怎么样  宝贝
What's up, baby?

1782
01:23:05,745 --> 01:23:06,677
伙计们
Hey, fellas.

1783
01:23:06,746 --> 01:23:08,077

Hey, what's happening?

1784
01:23:08,147 --> 01:23:09,580

1785
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:10,775
好啦
Okay, all right.

1786
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:13,045
听说你们来了  祝你们好运
Heard you were here. Just wanted to wish you luck.

1787
01:23:14,186 --> 01:23:15,175
顺便说一下
Oh, by the way,

1788
01:23:15,254 --> 01:23:16,846
我带了个人见你
brought somebody by to see you.

1789
01:23:16,922 --> 01:23:17,980
是吗
Oh, is that right?

1790
01:23:18,057 --> 01:23:19,354
是的
Yeah.

1791
01:23:27,099 --> 01:23:28,657
好了  我们都出去吧
Okay, everybody, let's move on out of here.

1792
01:23:28,734 --> 01:23:29,962
快点
Come on.

1793
01:23:30,036 --> 01:23:31,901
好了  大家都听见亨德森先生的话了
All right, you heard what Mr. Henderson said.

1794
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:32,903
你先走  小伙子
After you, young man.

1795
01:23:32,972 --> 01:23:34,701
好的
Okay.

1796
01:23:54,293 --> 01:23:57,353
对不起我选择了逃避
I'm sorry I ran out the way I did.

1797
01:23:58,564 --> 01:24:00,896
我才是逃避的人
I'm the one who ran out.

1798
01:24:00,966 --> 01:24:03,093
你不需要道歉
There's no need for you to apologize.

1799
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,838
能帮你打领带吗
Can I help you with your tie?

1800
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:12,207
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

1801
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:14,303
你知道自己在做什么吗
You know what you're doing?

1802
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,211
是的  我当然知道
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1803
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,377
好了
Here you go.

1804
01:24:24,957 --> 01:24:26,185
你没事吧
You all right?

1805
01:24:26,258 --> 01:24:28,055
没事  帮我拿点水
Yeah. Just some water, please.

1806
01:24:28,127 --> 01:24:29,094
该死
Damn!

1807
01:24:29,161 --> 01:24:30,458
相机都准备好了
All cameras are on point.

1808
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:31,723
刚加了两个麦克风
We just added two mics.

1809
01:24:31,797 --> 01:24:33,458
爱普斯坦先生  快过来一下
Mr. Epstein! You better come quick.

1810
01:24:33,532 --> 01:24:34,328
快点  我是认真的
Come on, I'm serious.

1811
01:24:34,328 --> 01:24:35,124
快点  情况紧急
Come on! It's important!

1812
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:36,361
好的  帮我照看一下这里
All right. Take care of those.

1813
01:24:36,435 --> 01:24:37,459
只有15分钟了  丹尼
15 minutes, Danny.

1814
01:24:40,306 --> 01:24:41,398
他突然就病发了
He just collapsed.

1815
01:24:41,474 --> 01:24:43,203
我觉得他肯定很痛
I think he's in a lot of pain.

1816
01:24:43,275 --> 01:24:44,742
张开手  张开手
Open your hand.Open your hand.

1817
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:45,868
在这里  在这里
Right there, right there.

1818
01:24:45,945 --> 01:24:48,311
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

1819
01:24:49,482 --> 01:24:51,814
坚强点  老兄  坚持住
Be strong, brother.Hang on in there.

1820
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:53,749
现在不是去医院检查的时候
It ain't time for you to check out now.

1821
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:55,081
检查  干嘛
Check out? What?

1822
01:24:55,154 --> 01:24:56,320
行了  伙计
Come on, man.

1823
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,486
大家都知道是怎么回事
Everybody knows, man.

1824
01:24:57,556 --> 01:24:59,888
我阿姨也在用这种该死的药  伙计
My aunt was taking the same doggone pills, man.

1825
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:02,621
她一个星期  疼得又踢又叫
Took her about a week before she wasted away to nothing,

1826
01:25:02,695 --> 01:25:03,889
然后就越来越瘦弱直到死去
just kicking and screaming.

1827
01:25:03,963 --> 01:25:05,328
我不知道她得什么病死的
I don't know what killed her ass,

1828
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:08,696
但如果她是吃了这种药  那她就有膀胱炎
but if she was taking those,she had a bladder infection.

1829
01:25:08,768 --> 01:25:09,894
你说什么
Say what?

1830
01:25:09,969 --> 01:25:13,132
蒙古大夫  我有肾结石
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,I got a kidney stone.

1831
01:25:13,205 --> 01:25:14,695
虽然在尿尿的时候确实他妈的痛
Hurts like a motherfucker when I pee,

1832
01:25:14,774 --> 01:25:16,036
但还不至于要了我的命
but it ain't gonna kill me.

1833
01:25:16,108 --> 01:25:17,302
这么说你不是要死啦
So you're not dying?

1834
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:20,743
自从我们呱呱坠地  都注定了会有死的那天
From the first slap and cry,we all start to die.

1835
01:25:20,813 --> 01:25:23,475
但我不会死得那么早  绝对不会
But I ain't on no accelerated program,hell, no.

1836
01:25:23,549 --> 01:25:25,744
真是天大的笑话
Ain't that about a bitch?

1837
01:25:25,818 --> 01:25:28,685
我做了这一切  把你从监狱里劫出来
All that damn hard work,busting your ass out of jail,

1838
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:29,914
但你却还死不了
and you ain't even dying.

1839
01:25:29,989 --> 01:25:31,354
我多希望能看你到死的那一刻
I was kinda looking forward to seeing you go.

1840
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:33,618
打扰一下  丹尼  他们两分钟后上台
Excuse me, Danny.They're on in two.

1841
01:25:33,692 --> 01:25:35,284
好的  大家都准备好了吗  伙计们
All right. Where we at, guys?

1842
01:25:36,495 --> 01:25:38,190
好了  我没事
Okay, I'm good.

1843
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,659
犹如麦加圣地一般的阿波罗剧场
The Apollo, the mecca.

1844
01:25:43,736 --> 01:25:45,135
唤起了无数的美好回忆  伙计
This brings back memories, man.

1845
01:25:45,204 --> 01:25:46,831
我们已经在这表演过多少次了
How many times you think we've performed here?

1846
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:49,471
条子
ooh, five-oh.

1847
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:50,509
50场  真的吗
50, really?

1848
01:25:50,576 --> 01:25:51,941
有条子
Five-oh.

1849
01:25:52,011 --> 01:25:53,171
快点  跑  跑
Come on. Move, move.

1850
01:25:53,245 --> 01:25:55,008
是他们  站住  站住
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

1851
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,344
所有单位注意  所有单位注意
All units report, all units report.

1852
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:58,815
发现嫌疑犯
Suspects have been spotted.

1853
01:25:58,884 --> 01:26:01,853
所有单位  秘密拘捕他们  但记住按规章办事
All units, apprehend them quietly and by the book.

1854
01:26:03,222 --> 01:26:05,190
路  你认为他们走了吗  伙计
Hey, Lou, do you think they're gone, man?

1855
01:26:05,257 --> 01:26:06,781
我又不能透视  蠢货
I don't have X-ray vision, motherfucker!

1856
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:07,883
我怎么会知道
How would I know?

1857
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,190
声音小点  路  该死
Lower your voice, Lou.Doggone it, man.

1858
01:26:10,262 --> 01:26:12,093
这里太黑了  根本什么都看不到
It's so dark in here you can't see shit.

1859
01:26:12,164 --> 01:26:13,392
等等
Hold up.

1860
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:14,898
我看看能不能找到打火机
Let me see if I can reach my lighter.

1861
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:16,093
别在这点打火机  伙计
Don't light no lighter up in here, man.

1862
01:26:16,168 --> 01:26:17,658
你想让我们变成烤肉吗
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

1863
01:26:17,736 --> 01:26:19,328
等一下
Hold on one minute.

1864
01:26:19,405 --> 01:26:21,100
该死的
Shit.

1865
01:26:24,844 --> 01:26:27,870
是他妈的马库斯・胡克斯
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

1866
01:26:27,947 --> 01:26:30,347
这里离林伍德大街挺远的吧  混蛋
Long way from Linwood Street, huh,motherfucker?

1867
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:32,748
去他妈的林伍德大街  还有他
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

1868
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:34,351
他利用了我们两个  这你是知道的
He used both of us, and you know it.

1869
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:35,352
别这样  老兄
Come on, man.

1870
01:26:35,353 --> 01:26:37,351
他只不过觉得自己是腕儿了就单飞了而已
He just thought he'd be a bigger star going solo.

1871
01:26:37,352 --> 01:26:38,352
他做得很对
He was right.

1872
01:26:38,352 --> 01:26:39,352
对个屁
No he wasn't.

1873
01:26:39,352 --> 01:26:41,352
他只不过不想把钱分成三份罢了
He didn't want to split the money three ways.

1874
01:26:41,627 --> 01:26:42,753
看看他那衰样  傻呆呆地坐着
Just look at him, sitting there

1875
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:44,887
脸上还挂着老年痴呆般的笑容
with that old shit-eating grin on his face.

1876
01:26:44,964 --> 01:26:47,455
你觉得自己很行  是不是  混蛋
You think you're all that, motherfucker, don't you?

1877
01:26:47,533 --> 01:26:49,364
我必须承认  每次只要一想到你
I have to admit, every time I think about you,

1878
01:26:49,435 --> 01:26:51,699
我就恨不得想把你掐死
I could just choke the shit out of you!

1879
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:52,896
住手  住手
Stop it, stop it!

1880
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:54,803
弗洛伊德  他没想法  他是死人
Floyd, he ain't thinking shit. He's dead.

1881
01:26:57,443 --> 01:27:00,503
看啊  这不是我的表吗
Say, ain't that my watch?

1882
01:27:00,579 --> 01:27:02,570
看看  你认为是我偷了那该死的
See? You thought I stole that mother...

1883
01:27:02,648 --> 01:27:04,673
我告诉过你这混蛋是一个盗窃狂
I told you this motherfucker was a klepto!

1884
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,115
该死  看看那个
Shit, look at that.

1885
01:27:06,185 --> 01:27:07,550
真漂亮
That's nice.

1886
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:08,712
也许这个也是偷的
Probably stole that, too.

1887
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:11,051
这混蛋的品位向来不错
Motherfucker always had good taste, though.

1888
01:27:11,123 --> 01:27:12,454
这个我留下了
I'm gonna keep this.

1889
01:27:17,096 --> 01:27:18,927
路易斯
Hey, Louis.

1890
01:27:18,998 --> 01:27:21,193
你觉得如果
You think if, you know...

1891
01:27:21,267 --> 01:27:23,235
如果他没有  没有死的话
if he wouldn't have, you know, died,

1892
01:27:23,302 --> 01:27:24,599
你觉得我们会再重组吗
you think we would have got back together?

1893
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,262
不  当然不
Oh, hell, no.

1894
01:27:26,338 --> 01:27:28,169
但是你知道吗
But you know what?

1895
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,298
我们现在在一起
We are together,

1896
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,434
我一直在考虑我们的分配问题
and I've been thinking about our little arrangement.

1897
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:35,706
我们把酬金五五分  怎么样
I'm gonna go ahead and break you off 50/50, all right?

1898
01:27:35,781 --> 01:27:37,373
路  你实在是
Wow, Lou, that's...

1899
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:40,111
你实在是太够意思了  伙计
that's real black of you, man.

1900
01:27:40,185 --> 01:27:41,812
但是我们其实没有酬金
Because there ain't no money.

1901
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:42,911
你说什么
Say what?

1902
01:27:42,988 --> 01:27:44,956
是你自己说的
Well, you said it yourself.

1903
01:27:45,024 --> 01:27:46,013
这是个葬礼
It's a funeral.

1904
01:27:46,091 --> 01:27:47,251
没人会花钱请你唱歌  伙计
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

1905
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:48,725
那个酬金是你编出来的
You lied about the money?

1906
01:27:48,794 --> 01:27:50,728
-是的  -你这个混蛋
- Yeah.- You motherfucker.

1907
01:27:50,796 --> 01:27:52,661
但你不能说来这一趟并不值得啊
Hey, you can't say it wasn't worth it.

1908
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,596
我是想说不值得
Well, I could say it.

1909
01:27:56,468 --> 01:27:58,265
但那是撒谎
But I'd be lying.

1910
01:27:58,337 --> 01:27:59,998
我爱你  路
I love you, Lou.

1911
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:02,165
好兄弟
My nigger.

1912
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:04,266
但对于这个混蛋  我忍不住
But this motherfucker,you know, I can't help it.

1913
01:28:04,343 --> 01:28:06,436
每一次  我都忍不住想要杀了这个混蛋
Every time,I could just kill this motherfucker!

1914
01:28:06,512 --> 01:28:08,480
他离开的原因就是你总是挑剔他
That's why he left, because you was always picking on him.

1915
01:28:08,547 --> 01:28:09,605
别跟他较劲了
Stop fucking with him.

1916
01:28:09,682 --> 01:28:11,582
他毁了我的幸福
He fucked with my happiness.

1917
01:28:20,492 --> 01:28:22,221
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1918
01:28:22,294 --> 01:28:24,762
我是艾萨克・赫斯
I'm Isaac Hayes.

1919
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:28,589
他们死到哪儿去了  丹尼
Where the fuck are they, Danny?

1920
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:31,693
我亲爱的朋友们  请跟我一起
My good friends, please join me

1921
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:35,536
向我们的兄弟马库斯・胡克斯告别
in saying farewell to brother Marcus Hooks.

1922
01:28:41,547 --> 01:28:42,912
是路易斯和弗洛伊德
It's Louis and Floyd!

1923
01:28:42,982 --> 01:28:44,108
是正拳组合
It's the Real Deal!

1924
01:28:47,252 --> 01:28:50,050
马库斯・胡克斯和正拳组合
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal,

1925
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:51,851
再度聚首
back together again.

1926
01:28:51,924 --> 01:28:54,853
请为他们鼓掌吧
Give them a hand.

1927
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:57,828
为了团聚
Reunited, y'all.

1928
01:28:57,896 --> 01:28:59,295
他们将再次合作
They got their shit together.

1929
01:28:59,365 --> 01:29:02,198
是的  让我们拭目以待吧
Yes! Let's go!

1930
01:29:02,267 --> 01:29:04,098
各就各位  听我的命令行事
Stand by.Move in on my command.

1931
01:29:04,169 --> 01:29:05,636
请等等  等等  等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1932
01:29:05,704 --> 01:29:07,365
拜托了  各位警官和探长
Come on, Officer detective person.

1933
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:08,701
求你们  别这样
Please, just, you know, come on.

1934
01:29:08,774 --> 01:29:10,639
允许他们唱一首歌  只要一首
Let them sing one song.One little song.

1935
01:29:10,709 --> 01:29:12,370
不会出什么乱子的
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

1936
01:29:12,444 --> 01:29:14,071
正拳组合
The Real Deal!

1937
01:29:16,348 --> 01:29:19,408
好吧  就一首歌
All right. One song.

1938
01:29:19,485 --> 01:29:21,385
但最好是好歌
But it better be good.

1939
01:29:22,421 --> 01:29:25,413
一首歌  一首好歌
One song. The good one.

1940
01:29:30,029 --> 01:29:31,155
胯骨感觉怎么样
How's that hip?

1941
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:32,322
完全准备好了  宝贝
Locked and loaded, baby.

1942
01:29:32,398 --> 01:29:33,660
开始吧
Let's do this.

1943
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,795
乐队
Band!

1944
01:29:36,869 --> 01:29:38,860
我们来一首《公园漫步》
Let's take a walk in the park.

1945
01:29:38,937 --> 01:29:41,235
1  2  3  4
1,2,3,4!

1946
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,386
当河水开始流淌
When the river gets to rollin'

1947
01:29:57,456 --> 01:30:01,085
你为其注入满满灵魂
And then you add a bowlful of soul in

1948
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:04,425
我试着让它尽情奔放
And then I tried to let it all go then

1949
01:30:06,231 --> 01:30:08,358
哦  对我来说很简单
Oh, it's easy to me

1950
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:11,801
看看  我如何驾驭节拍
You see, the way I ride the rhythm

1951
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:15,431
看看  我如何只讲实话
You see, the truth is all I can give 'em

1952
01:30:15,507 --> 01:30:18,203
而歌词就是取自生活
And the lyrics can come from livin'

1953
01:30:18,277 --> 01:30:21,974
哦  耶  哦  对我来说很简单
Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me

1954
01:30:23,816 --> 01:30:27,775
音乐就来自我的内心
Music comes out of my heart

1955
01:30:27,853 --> 01:30:31,812
就像漫步在公园
Something like a walking the park

1956
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,950
就像漫步在公园一样
It's just a walk in the park

1957
01:30:36,895 --> 01:30:39,625
我没听见  其他人在公园
And no one else in here, I heard it

1958
01:30:39,698 --> 01:30:43,327
我不知道  是否得偿所愿
I don't know what I've done to deserve it

1959
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:46,997
全心投入没有疑惑
You don't question it while you serve it

1960
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:50,398
这是天赐机缘
Oh, it was given to me

1961
01:30:50,476 --> 01:30:54,003
赋予我你的激情
I got something you inherit

1962
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:57,105
我不知道你是否为分享它而生
I don't know that you was born to share it

1963
01:30:57,182 --> 01:31:01,118
但是  若想成功  没它不行
And if you shoot,be sure you wear it

1964
01:31:03,188 --> 01:31:04,519
哦  这是我的本性流露
Oh, it comes naturally to me

1965
01:31:06,892 --> 01:31:08,985
音乐就来自我的内心
Music comes out of my heart

1966
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:14,191
就像漫步在公园
Something like a walk in the park

1967
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:16,257
就像漫步在公园一样
It's just a walk in the park

1968
01:31:22,074 --> 01:31:24,133
今也你们是否开心
Y'all having a good time out here tonight?

1969
01:31:24,209 --> 01:31:26,234
我就是想让你开心
This is what I'm talking about!

1970
01:31:26,311 --> 01:31:28,472
你可知公园漫步  伙计
You know about that walk in the park, man?

1971
01:31:28,547 --> 01:31:30,037
我当然知道公园漫步
Sure I know about that walk in the park.

1972
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:31,605
-真的  -让你瞧瞧
-You do? -I'll tell you what.

1973
01:31:31,683 --> 01:31:33,446
-让他们看看 -开始
- Show them. - Got to get down.

1974
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,454
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1975
01:31:42,528 --> 01:31:44,519
请在阿波罗剧院的舞台上
let's give a big Apollo welcome

1976
01:31:44,596 --> 01:31:46,496
热烈欢迎首次在这里表演的
to the stage for the first time,

1977
01:31:46,565 --> 01:31:50,695
我的女儿  克里奥・惠特菲尔德小姐
my daughter, Miss Cleo Whitfield!

1978
01:31:50,769 --> 01:31:54,364
全力开创一片天地
To make something out of nothin'

1979
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:57,875
这是我们共同志愿
That's what we all got in common

1980
01:31:57,943 --> 01:32:01,470
只需紧紧相拥  我就到来
So just hold on tight, I'm comin'

1981
01:32:03,549 --> 01:32:04,982
告诉我
Said to me

1982
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:08,213
我就给你可坚持的信仰
I'll give you something you can believe in

1983
01:32:08,287 --> 01:32:12,053
今夜我们全身心投入
And then enjoy yourself this evenin'

1984
01:32:12,124 --> 01:32:15,355
你肯定不能抽身而去
And don't you dare think about leavin'

1985
01:32:17,296 --> 01:32:21,130
跟我一起唱
Sing along with me

1986
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,727
音乐就来自我内心
Music comes out of my heart

1987
01:32:24,803 --> 01:32:27,203
就像漫步在公园
Something like a walk in the park

1988
01:32:27,272 --> 01:32:30,532
就像漫步在公园一样
It's just a walk in the park

1989
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:38,213
音乐就来自我内心
Music comes out of my heart

1990
01:32:38,283 --> 01:32:42,652
就像漫步在公园
Something like a walk in the park

1991
01:32:42,721 --> 01:32:45,519
就像漫步在公园一样
It's just a walk in the park

1992
01:32:49,628 --> 01:32:52,324
音乐就来自我内心
Music comes out of my heart

1993
01:32:52,397 --> 01:32:53,851
就一首歌
One song.

1994
01:32:54,351 --> 01:32:57,992
因在狱中表现良好获得减刑
正拳组合终于正式重返舞台

1995
01:33:01,002 --> 01:33:02,351
并且加入一名新主唱

1996
01:33:02,841 --> 01:33:05,366
音乐就来自我内心
Music comes out of my heart

1997
01:33:05,444 --> 01:33:07,503
我是他们的经纪人
I'm their manager!

1998
01:33:07,579 --> 01:33:09,672
就像漫步在公园
Something like a walk in the park

1999
01:33:09,748 --> 01:33:11,511
漫步在公园
Walk in the park

2000
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:12,777
就像漫步在公园一样
It's just a walk in the park

2001
01:33:12,851 --> 01:33:18,915
就像漫步在公园一样
Just like a walk in the park

2002
01:34:15,681 --> 01:34:17,376
你今晚会唱得很棒
You're gonna sing real nice tonight.

2003
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:23,315
快乐时光要来临
Got that funky time

2004
01:34:23,388 --> 01:34:31,993
我能感受到
I can feel it

2005
01:34:33,632 --> 01:34:35,998
每当摄像机或者麦克风开启之后
Any time the camera or the mic comes on,

2006
01:34:36,068 --> 01:34:37,501
我不会糊弄自己
I don't cheat myself.

2007
01:34:37,569 --> 01:34:39,969
这是我在孩提时候学到的第一条原则
That was rule number 1 I was taught as a kid.

2008
01:34:40,038 --> 01:34:41,835
当然我肯定也不能糊弄观众
And I definitely can't cheat the audience.

2009
01:34:41,907 --> 01:34:43,704
因此每一次做事
So I give 150%

2010
01:34:43,775 --> 01:34:46,869
我都会付出150%的努力
every single time that I do anything.

2011
01:34:46,945 --> 01:34:48,708
我的生活中也是这样
Even the way I live my life.

2012
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:51,647
我会珍惜每一次糟糕的经历
I just cherish each doggone moment.

2013
01:34:51,717 --> 01:34:54,242
再说个黑人牧师的笑话吧  怎么样
A black preacher's something else, ain't it?

2014
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:57,345
你去了教堂以后付不起房租
You can't pay your rent after you come from church.

2015
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:01,325
如果你向牧师要5块钱
And if you ask the preacher for the $5.00,

2016
01:35:01,393 --> 01:35:04,385
他这样告诉你  "以神的名义操你妈"
he'll be like, "Fuck you in the name of Jesus. "

2017
01:35:04,463 --> 01:35:07,227
我的喜剧不是臆想出来的
My comedy is not fictitious.

2018
01:35:07,299 --> 01:35:10,564
我的喜剧必须得来自我的内心
My comedy has to come from my heart.

2019
01:35:13,271 --> 01:35:15,967
-查理・陈是个好汉  -好吧  来排练一下
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.- All right, let's rehearse.

2020
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:18,566
上完厕所  逛过中国还没洗手
He went through China with his shit in his hand.

2021
01:35:18,643 --> 01:35:21,134
五个女人靠墙站
Had five women against the wall.

2022
01:35:21,213 --> 01:35:23,943
我敢打赌他把她们全部都干
I betcha five dollars that he fucked them all.

2023
01:35:24,015 --> 01:35:25,312
他辛苦地干
He fucked them hard.

2024
01:35:25,384 --> 01:35:26,510
他长久地干
He fucked them long.

2025
01:35:26,585 --> 01:35:29,145
一直感到弟弟被抽干
He fucked them till his shit got sore.

2026
01:35:29,221 --> 01:35:31,689
他去看病  大夫回答
He went to the doctor,and the doctor said,

2027
01:35:31,757 --> 01:35:34,089
"对不起  查理  你的弟弟已经不应答"
"Sorry, Charlie, your dick is dead. "

2028
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:36,992
他说  "大夫  大夫  不是真的阿"
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,that can't be true. "

2029
01:35:37,062 --> 01:35:39,690
"没错  先生  你的蛋蛋也没气啦"
"Yes, sir, Charlie,your balls are too!"

2030
01:35:41,533 --> 01:35:43,296
我的一生都在演出
I've been performing all my life.

2031
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,029
因此  对我来说  在观众面前表演
So being in front of an audience

2032
01:35:45,103 --> 01:35:46,730
从来都不是问题
has never been a problem for me.

2033
01:35:46,805 --> 01:35:48,636
该离开了
It's time to go?

2034
01:35:49,574 --> 01:35:50,939
那就走呗
Well, go on, then.

2035
01:35:53,845 --> 01:35:56,609
要给观众留下长久的印象
You want to leave a lasting impression on your audience.

2036
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,241
这也是我第一次开始表演时
You know, and that's something I was taught, too,

2037
01:35:59,317 --> 01:36:00,614
别人教给我的
when I first started.

2038
01:36:00,685 --> 01:36:01,913
尽量让观众记住你
Always make them remember you,

2039
01:36:01,987 --> 01:36:04,785
或者记住关于你的电影的一些事
or remember something about you and the film.

2040
01:36:04,856 --> 01:36:08,485
我要回我600美金一晚上的酒店去了
I'm going back to my $600-a-night hotel room,

2041
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:13,497
来一个  一个泡泡浴什么的
have me a nice-ass, uh,piece of pussy and shit.

2042
01:36:13,565 --> 01:36:14,623
是吗
Okay?

2043
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:16,758
停
Cut it.

2044
01:36:18,537 --> 01:36:19,629
好的  深呼吸  深呼吸
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

2045
01:36:19,704 --> 01:36:21,729
我还没进去呢

2048
01:36:28,346 --> 01:36:30,644
只想为你摇摆

我就不会像现在这样成功

我经历的最艰苦的事情
My task here on Earth

2063
01:37:16,862 --> 01:37:19,990
就是我必须得比常人更加地努力
is I have to work harder than the average bear.

2064
01:37:20,065 --> 01:37:22,072
这看起来很简单  不是吗
It look easy, don't it?

2065
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:23,854
但实际上不是的
But it's not.
