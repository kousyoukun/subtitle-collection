00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,449
馬庫斯·胡克斯和正拳組和帶來第6張專輯
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal, take 6.

2
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:05,486
-應該報三個人的名字  -你要我來唱主旋律嗎
- That's three names. - You want me to sing the main line?

3
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:08,113
好啦  開唱吧  開唱吧
Oh, yeah, here we go, here we go.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,623
今晚我們將踏上南下的音樂之旅
Tonight we take a musical journey south,

5
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:13,661
傳奇靈魂樂樂隊馬庫斯·胡克斯和正拳組合
where the legendary soul band Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal

6
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,662
就是在那裡練就了他們的標誌性嗓音
developed their signature sound.

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,129
1  2
1, 2!

8
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:25,611
開始的時候  3人只是
They started out singing for pennies

9
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:27,699
在孟菲斯的市井賣唱
On the street corners of Memphis.

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,710
片名  靈魂歌手
拉拉繩
Pull the string

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,270
我就向你眨眨眼
And I'll wink at you

12
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:34,940
我是你的玩偶
I'm your puppet

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,054
我會逗你笑
I'll do funny things

14
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:43,590
如果你想要
If you want me to

15
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,387
我是你的玩偶
I'm your puppet

16
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:51,429
我是你的
I'm yours

17
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:55,230
永遠被你操縱
To have and to hold

18
00:00:55,303 --> 00:01:00,603
親愛的  你能全權操控我這個小木偶
Darling, you've got full control of your puppet

19
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,076
但到了1972年
But by 1972,

20
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:04,634
馬庫斯·胡克斯和正拳組合
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal

21
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:07,944
已經成為藍調音樂界的領軍樂隊
had become one of the biggest R&B acts in the world.

22
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:11,110
只有甜蜜靈魂樂
Nothin' like sweet soul music

23
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:13,120
讓我們同聚首
To bring us together

24
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:15,782
他們在全球的演唱會票房都很火爆
They played to sellout houses all over the world.

25
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:17,552
賣出600萬張唱片
They'd sold 6 million records

26
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,287
同時他們影響了一代美國樂壇
and influenced a generation of American musicians.

27
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:23,195
伴著甜蜜靈魂樂翩翩起舞
Dance to the sweet soul music

28
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:27,234
但這一切在1977年7月24日終結
But that all ended on July 24, 1977,

29
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:29,270
因為馬庫斯·胡克斯在紐約麥迪遜花園
when Marcus Hooks began his solo career

30
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:30,560
舉辦了一場激動人心的演唱會
with a dramatic concert

31
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:32,306
宣告自己單飛
at New York's Madison Square Garden.

32
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:34,001
女士們   先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

33
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:36,873
歡迎馬庫思·胡克斯
Marcus Hooks.

34
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:54,485
正當胡克斯在樂壇叱吒風雲之時
But while Hooks became a music legend,

35
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:57,292
樂隊的另兩個成員弗洛伊德·亨德森和
the journey took a decidedly different direction

36
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:00,061
路易斯·海因茲毅然改變了曲風
for former band mates Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds.

37
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:03,931
他們憑藉《公園漫步》一曲成名
Renowned for their signature dance stylings

38
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,701
其獨特的舞步風格讓他們備受讚譽
from their one breakout hit, "Walk in the Park,"

39
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:09,266
但是二人於1979年分道揚鑣
the duo broke up in 1979.

40
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,834
據說是因為創作意見分歧
Citing creative differences

41
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:13,779
並且各自奔向自己的前程
and a desire to pursue separate projects.

42
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:15,941
退後  不許動
Back off! Freeze!

43
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,279
舉起手  讓我看見你的手
Get your hands up! Let me see them!

44
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:19,479
等等  等等  這不是...
Oh. Wait. Wait, wait. It ain't... Ohh!

45
00:02:19,554 --> 00:02:22,352
槍是假的  不是真槍
The gun ain't real! Ow! It ain't real! Ow!

46
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,119
最新消息  正拳樂隊成員路易斯·海因茲被捕
我只是沒錢了  見鬼
I'm just broke, God it!

47
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,716
我沒想傷害誰
I ain't tryin' to hurt no!

48
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,261
小心你的爪子
Watch your damn hands!

49
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:28,795
警察真他媽的殘忍
Police mother brutality!

50
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,228
而另一位弗洛伊德·亨德森
While Floyd Henderson...

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,395
歡迎光臨弗洛伊德洗車服務公司
Come on down to Floyd's Car Wash,

52
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,528
您的愛車全部享受手工擦洗服務
where everything is done by hand.

53
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:38,367
他將其出色的表演
...combined his showmanship

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,635
同商業頭腦相結合
with an entrepreneur spirit.

55
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,835
別忘了"銷魂星期日"哦
And don't forget about Super Soul Sundays,

56
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:45,004

00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:55,385
快來免費洗輪胎
Come and get your rimjob!

61
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:58,483
被人遺忘的正拳組合亨德森和
Whatever happened to the forgotten duo Henderson and Hinds

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,959
海因茲究竟都遭遇了什麼呢
The Real Deal?

63
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:05,495
寶貝  把導航儀打開
Baby, turn the navigation on.

64
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,229
希望在天黑前能到地方
I hope we can find this place sometime tonight.

65
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,895
他會愛上那兒的
He gonna love it there.

66
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,996
那裡有坎麥可調床

00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,006
跟你們說過了  最好安靜點
Y'all better shut up back there, I'm tellin' you.

69
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,271
我真想把手伸到後座上
I'm gonna reach back there

70
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,813
把一個小崽子倒拎起來揍一頓
and pop one of them little boys upside the head so bad.

71
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,044
弗洛伊德叔叔  我想這就是我們要的
I think that's it, Uncle Floyd.

72
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,787
真不敢相信我竟然任你埋怨
Now, I can't believe I let you talk me into this bullshit.

73
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:31,849
你想說什麼  這多美啊  你不喜歡嗎
What you talking about? It's beautiful. You don't like this?

74
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:33,018
這就是一死氣沉沉的營地
It's a death camp.

75
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:35,426
叔叔  它怎麼就是死氣沉沉的營地啦
Oh, how is it a death camp, Unc?

76
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,624
這裡有36個洞高爾夫場地
We got 36 holes of golf.

77
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,326
3個游泳池
Three swimming pools.

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,300
這地方的男女比例
You know the ratio of women to men here

79
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,963
是1比5  叔叔  1比5啊
is 5 to 1, Unc? 5 to 1.

80
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:45,335
意思是這的小妞兒一大片
That mean you got 'em everywhere.

81
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,668
擠得你都動不了  到處是小妞兒...
You can't even move. There's women...

82
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,208
隨便看一圈
Every time you look around,

83
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:50,335
身邊到處都是妞兒
women crawling between your legs, arms, anything.

84
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,244
見鬼  叔叔  如果你擔心生意的話
I mean, damn, Unc. And if you're worried about the business,

85
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:54,338
我來搞定
I got that.

86
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:56,144
你那套我都學會了
You taught me everything you know.

87
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:57,809
是啊
Yeah.

88
00:03:57,886 --> 00:03:59,854
行啊  我告訴你  小子
Yeah. You know something, son?

89
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:00,888
你真夠狡猾的
You're real crafty.

90
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:01,887
多謝誇獎
Appreciate that.

91
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,446
第一步  你搬進我家
See, first you move into my house.

92
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:05,220
然後  你搶走我的生意
Then you take over my business.

93
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:06,817
-夥計  我沒有搶走  -對了  還有
- Aw, man, I ain't taking...  - Oh, yeah.

00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,556
夥計  再然後  你想盡辦法騙我到這個山谷來
Then you move me all the way out to the Valley, man,

95
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,154
就沒人聽到我尖叫了  對不
so can't nobody hear me scream. Right?

96
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,597
實際上  這就是為啥把你弄到這來
Actually, that's why we're moving you here.

97
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,658
在這裡護士才能聽見你的驢叫
So the nurses can hear your ass scream.

98
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,101
還記得你摔倒在地板上躺了三天嗎
You remember you fell on that floor for three days

99
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:18,139
-沒人聽見你求救  -我記得
- and couldn't nobody hear you. - I remember.

100
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:22,540
那就行了  別抱怨啦  享受人生吧  叔叔
Yeah. Now, stop being bitter, man. Enjoy yourself, Unc.

101
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,374
你的黃金時代到來了  夥計
There are your golden years, player.

102
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,073
來吧  進屋裡來
Now, come on in the house and say bye

103
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,810
和沙琳還有孩子們告別
to Charlene and the kids.

104
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,342
見鬼的小崽子

105
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,445
見鬼的小崽子
Fuck the kids?

106
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:35,614

Yeah.

107
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:19,797
就這樣  寶貝兒
Ohhh... yeah, baby.

108
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:22,961
快給我  快  快點
Ohh! Oh, give it to me. Give it to me nice and hard.

109
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,700
就是這樣
Oh, right there!

110
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,706
寶貝  別停
Ooh. Don't stop, baby.

111
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,449
不  你不能跑
No, you're not getting away.

112
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:38,784
真爽
Yummy!

113
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:03,303
髖關節感覺怎樣
How's the hip?

114
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,503
還行
Fine.

115
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,604
那就好
Okay.

116
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:16,817
好了  亨德森先生
Okay, Mr. Henderson.

117
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:19,485
請站起來  面向窗戶
I'm gonna need you to, uh, stands up, face the window,

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,255
趴在桌子上
and bend over the table.

119
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,126
大夫  我的病跟屁股沒關係
My problem ain't back in that area, doctor.

120
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:25,392
亨德森先生  你的睡眠問題
Look, Mr. Henderson, your sleep problem

121
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,934
可能是多種原因引起的
can be a symptom of a myriad of different conditions,

122
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:29,230
其中之一  就是
some of which, you know, are...

123
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:31,499
您的屁股
well, you know, back in that area.

124
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:37,044
我討厭有人像同性性交那樣在我後面
I don't like nobody behind me like that, Huds.

125
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:38,874
告訴你  我不喜歡有人捅我的
I'm telling you, I just don't like nobody playing

126
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:40,607
-屁股眼  -我會很輕很輕的
- with my penny. - I'll be very gentle.

127
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,172
您不會有多大感覺的
I'll be in and out before you know it.

128
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:47,279
趴那兒  對了
Just bend over. There you go.

129
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,983

131
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:53,459
放鬆
Relax.

132
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:56,926
坐在海邊碼頭上
Sittin' on the dock of the bay

133
00:06:56,998 --> 00:07:01,025
看海...潮
Watching the tiiiiiide

134
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,195
潮...起...潮...落
Roll away

135
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,666
好了  亨德森先生  再說一次
All right, again, Mr. Henderson,

136

00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,048
夥計  這是什麼生活方式
What kind of lifestyle, man,

273
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:31,648
你腰纏萬貫嗎
you filthy motherfucker?

274
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:34,422
滿櫃子都是狗糧  可我沒看見狗
You got a pantry full of dog food. I don't see no dog.

275
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,019
狗在床底下  黑鬼
Dog under the bed, nigger! You lucky

276
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:37,860
你進門  狗沒咬你屁股算你走運
he ain't attacked your ass when you came in.

277
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:39,923
你就是那條狗  混蛋
You're the dog, motherfucker!

278
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,003
你的存款都幹什麼用了  夥計
What happened to all that fucking money you done saved, man?

279
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:47,302
存款  放屁
Saved? Shit.

280
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:49,842
從水門事件那時開始直到
I don't remember shit from Watergate

281
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,434
航天飛機爆炸
to when the space shuttle blew up.

282
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:52,672
我就不記得有存款
Hmm. Money I saved.

283
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:53,601
好吧  還有歌曲的版稅呢
Okay, what about the royalties?

284
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:56,111
我曾經每年能得到3萬塊呢
I used to get over $30,000 a year off that shit.

285
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:58,947
我賭撲克輸了我的那份  行了吧
I lost my royalties in a poker game. All right?

286
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:01,249
-撲克  -你聽好  夥計
- Poker? - Listen here, man.

287
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:03,483
如果你真想讓我
If you serious about un-assing me

288
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:05,525
再度出山
from my lavish surroundings here,

289
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:07,493
夥計  你得考慮
man, you gonna have to be a little more flexible

290
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,655
小讓一步  就...
in your thinking. Say, oh...

291
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:11,755
我6你4吧
60/40.

292
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,925
夥計  你可真是混帳加三級
Man, you must be higher than a motherfucker.

293
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,435
我們一直對半分的
We always split shit straight down the middle.

294
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:18,131
如果我不去演出
Ain't gonna be nothing to split

295
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,467
你連分都沒啥可分的  是吧
if I don't show up, now, is there?

296
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,839
分不到6成  我就不去
And I ain't showing up unless I get 60% of the proceeds.

297
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,138
反正你有錢  混帳東西
You rich anyway, motherfucker.

298
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:27,009
我在電視上看過的你洗車廣告了
I seen your little car wash commercials on the TV.

299
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,879
我已經把所有的生意都轉給我外甥了
I transferred all my business affairs over to my nephew.

300
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,975
-我現在靠固定收入  夥計  -那又怎樣
- I'm on a fixed income, man. - So what?

301
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:33,952
那就是中大獎了
So your draws!

302
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:35,682
所以現在2萬元對我來說
That's why that 20 damn thousand dollars

303
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:37,690
-很有吸引力  -是一萬六
- look good to me right now.- 16!

304
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:40,659
六四分成後你該得的那份
That's your cut of a 60/40 split.

305
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:42,218
這就是我的條件
And those are my terms.

306
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:44,264
而且沒有商量的餘地
And they're non-negotiable.

307
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:50,093
55/45
55/45.

308
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:58,140
去你大爺的
Fatherfuck you, man.

309
00:14:58,212 --> 00:15:00,942
你要我六四分
You're gonna tell me 60/40.

310
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,812
你有什麼資格命令我
You don't dictate to me!

311
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:05,317
我是他媽的弗洛伊德·亨德森
I'm Floyd motherfucking Henderson.

312
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,910
你和馬庫斯  都是我
You and Marc, I made you

313
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,511
造就了你和那個混蛋
and that motherfucker!

314
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,786
你不會唱歌  不會發鼻音  不會他媽的跳音
You can't sing, hum,or motherfucking skip.

315
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,190
我說得不對嗎
Ain't that a bitch?

316
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,057
都他媽的見鬼去吧
Skip on these motherfucking nuts!

317
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,664
希望你和馬庫斯都下地獄
You and Marcus, may you rest in shit.

318
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:20,427
混蛋  我是弗洛伊德·亨德森
Motherfucker.I'm Floyd fucking Henderson,

319
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:22,696
你這個道貌岸然的混蛋
you Apostle-faced motherfucker!

320
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:26,329
這個混蛋又沖我摔門
This motherfucker slams this door in my face one more time...

321
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:27,999
我煩透這個混蛋了
I'm tired of this motherfucker!

322
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,440
總是和這個混蛋過不去
Always had a problem with this bitch.

323
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,439
他啥都不是  一無所知
He ain't nothing. He's ignorant!

324
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,676
一個混蛋白痴
Motherfucker's just a idiot.

325
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,218
頭腦簡單的混球  整天無所事事
Chihuahua-head motherfucker, man, sitting up there,

326
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,379
還告訴別人自己有多忙
always want to tell somebody what to damn do.

327
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:43,889
他難道都是和傻子吹牛
He gonna sit there and talk the fool?

328
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,791
娘的  我血壓又升高了
Ooh, my blood pressure's high, motherfucker.

329
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:56,168
不要讓這個混蛋氣成這樣
Don't let this motherfucker get you like this.

330
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,535
又怎麼啦
What!

331
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:04,600
別叫
Stay!

332
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,218
首先  我要明確聲明並記錄在案
First of all, I clearly want to state this for the record.

333
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:16,415
我發現這種分配方式太卑鄙了  夥計
And I find this arrangement we got,man, despicable.

334
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,084
但我是弗洛伊德·亨德森  一個老演員
But I'm Floyd Henderson.I'm a trouper.

335
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,559
你知道我會不惜一切代價
And you know I'd do any doggone thing, man,

336
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:23,460
讓這個樂隊重返樂壇  夥計
to see this group get back on its feet,

337
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,395
因為你知道我是就是那種人
'cause you know that's the type of motherfucker I am.

338
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,933
但是  同時
But in the meantime,

339
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:30,630
我要回我一晚上600美元的賓館了
'm going back to my $600-a-night hotel room,

340
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:33,468
去洗個舒服的泡泡浴
and I'm gonna have me a nice hot bubble bath

341
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,065
洗掉這一身從你住的黑屋裡
to wash some of this filth and dirt and grime

342
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:39,203
染上的污垢和晦氣
from this black fucking hole you live in.

343
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,716
然後再吃上一頓肥美多汁
Then I'm having me a nice, juicy-ass steak, oh, yeah,

344
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:45,547
和你屁股一樣大的牛排
the size of your motherfucking back.

345
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:48,713
再然後沖個澡刮刮鬍鬚
Then I'm gonna take me a shit shower and shave.

346
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,757
早上六點鐘我會到這裡
And I'll be here at 6 a. m.

347
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:52,291
接你去該死的機場
To take you to the motherfucking airport.

348
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,553
-聽清楚了  -我不坐飛機
- You got me? - I don't fly.

349
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:54,855
且我早上8點起床
And I get up at 8.

350
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,297
等我表弟從州監獄出來
My cousin out the penitentiary,

351
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,197
我就讓他宰了這混蛋
I'm gonna have him kill this motherfucker!

352
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:04,864
他媽的跟我說話沒大沒小
Man talk to me like I'm a motherfucking kid.

353
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:06,065
我可不是三歲小孩
I ain't no motherfucking kid.

354
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,472
每次我們一起上路
Every time we... we start on the road,

355
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:11,306
他就開始說同樣的廢話
he starts in saying the same shit.

356
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,776
喂  誰給我拿午飯
Hey! Who's got my lunch?

357
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:14,779
你是誰
Who are you?

358
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:15,906
先生  我是菲利浦·紐曼
I'm Phillip Newman, sir,

359
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,314
新來的實習生  你大約
the new intern. You hired me,

360
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:18,578
20分鐘前雇了我
like, 20 minutes ago.

361
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:20,119
查克斯·紐曼是我叔叔
Chuckles Newman's my uncle.

362
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:21,518
-是他告訴你...  -住嘴
- He's the one that told you...- Stop talking.

363
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:23,249
-遵命  -我已經給了你一份工作
- Very good. - I already got a job for you.

364
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:24,882
好嗎  看看那個
Okay? Bing, bang, boom.Look at that.

365
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,450
對  亨德斯和海因茲  馬庫斯以前的和聲
Yeah. Henderson and Hinds,Marcus' old backup singers,

366
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,359
對悼念什麼的一無所知
are being real dickheads about this tribute thing...

367
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,625
天啊  亨德森和海因茲  正拳組合
Oh, my God! Henderson and Hinds!The Real Deal.

368
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:33,291
他們是唯一一支在單集《靈魂列車》中
They're the only band that got to play three songs

369
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:34,766
演唱三首插曲的樂隊
on a sing episode of Soul Train.

370
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:37,497
唐·科尼利厄斯當時在場  我還錄下來了
Don Cornelius was there as a witness,and I got it on VHS.

371
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:39,095
他們來這兒不是干這個  好嗎
They don't do that here. All right?

372
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:40,834
-是的  先生  -這是唱片公司
- Yes, sir.  - This is a record label,

373
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:41,966
不是歌迷俱樂部
not a fan club.

374
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,010
我要那兩個老傢伙週六到這裡
I want those two old fucks there on Saturday,

375
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:45,705
現在派你去辦這件事
and I want you to make that happen.

376
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:46,711
明白了嗎
Got it?

377
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:16,308
正拳組合要復出  誰也無法阻擋
The Real Deal is back,and they not gonna stop us now.

378
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,403
該死的
Ohh! Shit.

379
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:22,915
那他媽的是什麼  夥計
What the fuck is that, man?

380
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,382
槍啊
This is a gun.

381
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,681
沒它就無法穿過三K黨的地盤
I never travel through Klan country without one.

382
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:28,244
-你介意嗎  -當然
- You got a problem with that, pops?  - Yeah,

383
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:29,482
我對那很有意見  夥計
I got a problem with that, man.

384
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:30,955
上次我看到槍的時候
The last time I saw that gun,

385
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,549
你正指著我  要打我
you were pointing at me,and you were shooting it.

386
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:34,856
聽好了  弗洛伊德  我們不是兩個老朋友
Listen here, Floyd.We ain't two old friends

387
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:35,986
在某個週日駕車去做什麼
out for some Sunday drive

388
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,360
緬懷往事的旅遊  懂嗎
down Memory Lane. All right?

389
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:40,332
事實上  我一看見你就來氣
Fact is, I can hardly stand the sight of your ass,

390
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,767
所以你就不要惹我
so you best not to provoke me.

391
00:18:42,836 --> 00:18:43,962
惹了又怎樣
Or what's gonna happen?

392
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:45,699
從這裡到我們目的地之間
There's a lot of empty road

393
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,968
有很多空蕩蕩的路
between here and where we trying to go.

394
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,168
在那裡如果一個黑鬼消失了
Where a nigger could disappear

395
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,006
也不會有人想他
and where nobody'd miss his black ass.

396
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:54,746
讓我看看那支槍
Well, let me see that gun.

397
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:57,541
讓我看看
Let me see it!

398
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:58,880
小心點啊  傻瓜
Be careful, fool.

399
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:00,920
你以為我不會拿槍嗎  夥計
You don't think I know how to hold a gun, man?

400
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,580
我可是美國步槍射擊運動協會的一員
I'm a member of the NRA, man.

401
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,451
在哪...怎麼...老天啊
Where's... Now, what's... God damn it!

402
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:07,459
該死
Oh! Shit!

403
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:09,857
見鬼

你他媽的什麼毛病
What the hell is wrong with you!

409

不要在車裡開槍
Don't shoot no gun in a car!

410
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:29,578
你說...保險栓沒拉上嗎
You said... The safety wasn't on there.

411
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,447
保險栓個屁
Safety, my ass!

412
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:32,917
保險栓沒有
Safety wasn't...

416
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,519
亞利桑那州  旗杆鎮
距阿波羅演出還有4天

417
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:10,089
僅此一晚  千載難逢  正拳組合

418
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,887
那是什麼鬼東西
What the fuck is that?

419
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,689
致  意
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

420
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,826
好久沒有在霓虹燈上看到我們的名字了
Been a long time since we saw our name in lights.

421
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,561
我們的名字怎麼在霓虹燈上
What our name doing up in lights?

422
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,728
我們週末要在阿波羅劇場演出

我們有30多年沒上過舞台了
We ain't been on stage in over 30 years.

424
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:28,733
現在  最不應該做的事情
Now, the last thing you want to do

425
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,436
就是在這裡傻站著  是不是
is stink up the joint. Am I right?

426
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:32,172
所以我準備了一些熱身演唱
And I got us free dinner to boot.

427
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,155
夥計  我還留著這些衣服真是走運
Man, we sure are lucky I kept these threads.

428

看我們多帥啊

Better hope that button don't pop off and kill nobody.

430
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,488
天啊  褲子這麼緊希望不會擠爆我的蛋蛋
God damn, I wish these pants weren't squeezing my nuts so tight.

431
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:53,396
也許會幫你唱出高音
Maybe it'll help you hit those high notes.

432
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:56,027
我根本不需要幫助就能唱出高音
I don't need help hitting the high notes.

433
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,401
-是啊  走著瞧  -走著瞧
- Yeah, right. We'll see. - We'll see.

00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:47,346
煩惱之河

你的態度壞了事

我們過去搞砸了
What fucked our shit up back in the day

505
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:06,920
是因為你搞了我的女人
was you sticking your johnson in my woman!

506
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,240
女士們  先生們

517
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:51,927
還是繼續慪氣
or we just gonna let it fester?

518
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,373
好吧  我是有點遲鈍  行了吧
All right. Well, I was a little rusty, okay?

519
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:59,036
說你遲鈍都是輕的
That's a insult to rust, ain't it?

520
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:00,704
那你呢  混蛋
Well, what about you, motherfucker?

521
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:03,511
昨晚上你好像被水泥卡住了似的
Last night, look like you were stuck in cement.

522
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,777
路易斯  我做過髖關節置換手術
I had a hip replacement, Louis.

523
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,478
那你應多付100美元
Well, you should've paid a hundred more dollars

524
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:08,578
換一個豪華點  有點節奏感的型號
and got the deluxe model with some rhythm in it.

525
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:10,486
就因為你換的那個破髖關節
'Cause that motherfucker you got,

526
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:12,650
-它不好使  -算你對  夥計
- it ain't working.- Oh, that's fine, man.

527
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:13,784
但是我們要談的不是這個
But that's not what we talking about.

528
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,418
我是說奧黛特
I'm talking about Odetta.

529
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:18,758
路易斯  如果我們之間

532
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:23,734
就是這麼回事
period!

533
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:24,930
現在  這爛事還
Now, there's some shit

534
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,836
余臭未消
that's just etched in stone.

535
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,807
最重要的是
First and foremost is

536
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:33,278
朋友妻  不可欺
thou shall not dig for diamonds in another brother's mine!

537
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:36,076
胡扯  夥計  你自己也有責任
Bullshit, man. You gotta take some responsibility here.

538
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:37,241
你以為她不知道
You think she didn't know, man,

539
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:38,443
你吸菸

540
00:25:38,518 --> 00:25:39,746
酗酒  和吸毒
and drinking and drugs

541
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,287
還有睡別的女人  她知道
and other women? She knew.

542
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,345
她跑過來告訴我  "我的男人
She came running to me telling, "My man

543
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:46,415
路易斯做這  路易斯做那  抱抱我  弗洛伊德"
Louis did this. Louis did that.Hold me, Floyd. "

544
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:47,824
那好  睡了她不打緊
All right, well, getting the pussy is one thing.

545
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,327
-你也不必和她結婚吧  -什麼
- You ain't had to marry her.- What?

546
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:50,795
你就是個只會脫褲子的蠢貨
You'd have to be a zip-down fool

547
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:52,525
讓她從你手指尖溜走了  夥計
to let her slide through your fingers, man.

548
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,328
好吧  如果我是蠢貨  你也是
All right, well, if I'm a fool, then you are, too.

549
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:57,165
你以為我不知道  她也傷了我的心
You think I don't know that? She hurt my heart, too.

550
00:25:57,237 --> 00:26:00,798
很好  這真是他媽的少得可憐的安慰
Good!That's a poor motherfucking comfort.

551
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:04,139
但是  不管怎麼說  也是個安慰
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

552
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:05,439
每晚我都告訴你
Every night I'm telling

553
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:09,172
只要在這裡  你就會快樂
Every time you're here, you're making

554
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:24,987
那你在奧黛特之後又結過幾次婚
Well, how many times did you say you was married after Odetta?

555
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,494
四次
Four.

556
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:31,034
我和一個叫埃斯特爾的女孩兒結婚
I married this girl named Estelle

557
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:32,638
想忘掉奧黛特
to get over Odetta.

558
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:34,173
後來又和亨麗埃塔結婚
Then I married Henrietta.

559
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:36,436
她不適合我
She wasn't no good for me.

560
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,807
後來又和喬瑟芬結婚
Then I married Josephine.

561
00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:40,847
她當然也不適合我  因為後來她遇見了卡爾
She definitely wasn't no good for me because she met Carl.

562
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:42,905
好  那是第三個
All right. That's three.

563
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:44,678
誰是幸運的第四個呢
Who was lucky number four?

564
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:46,582
她叫康斯薇洛
Her name was Consuelo.

565
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:49,281
她離開我回古巴了
She left me and went back to Cuba.

566
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:52,348
哈哈  人們還真願意回古巴
Ha ha ha!People actually go back to Cuba?

567
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:54,518
她說她寧願餘生待在
She said she'd rather spend the rest of her life

568
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:56,926
獨裁國家也不願意再跟我多待一個晚上
under that dictatorship than spend another night with me.

569
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:01,593
你呢  你為什麼不結婚
How 'bout you? How come you never got married?

570
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:04,501
我本來可以在菲律賓的馬尼拉
I almost hooked up with this girl down in the Philippines,

571
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:05,560
搭上一女孩兒的
in Manila.

572
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:09,771
但是  我不會說
But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

573
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:11,936
塔加路族語  她唯一會的英語就是
Tagalog, and only English she knew

574
00:27:12,012 --> 00:27:14,003
花兩美元我就讓你爽個夠
was, "Me love you long time for two dollar. "

575
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:19,275
在奧黛特之後我就不擅長談戀愛
Yeah, I wasn't no good at relationships after Odetta.

576
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:20,649
你有她的消息嗎
You ever hear from her?

577
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,948
誰  那個菲律賓女孩兒
Who, Mai Mai?

578
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:22,954

No. Odetta.

579
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,014
沒有  夥計
Oh. No, man.

580
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:27,486
我有過她的消息  夥計
I heard from her, man.

581
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:29,028
就在聖誕節的時候
It was sometime around Christmas.

582
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:31,962
她住在塔爾薩  你知道嗎
You know, in that place she was living in Tulsa. You know?

583
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,267
媽的  啪  啪  啪  啪  啪
Fuck it.Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

584
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:36,962
你在幹什麼
What you doing?

585
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:38,766
-我看到一個歹徒  -你為什麼不把槍口朝上
- I saw a coyote. - Whyn't you put that thing up

586
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:40,135
省得傷到人  夥計
before somebody get hurt, man?

587
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:41,571
你怎麼老覺得我不會拿
How come you think I don't know how to handle

588
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:43,006
-這玩意  夥計  -認為
- no damn piece, man? - Think?

589
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:45,568
是知道
I know.

590
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:47,613
是嗎
Yeah?

591
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:50,013
好吧  過來和我練練  路易斯
Yeah, come fuck with me now, Louis.

592
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,550

00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:46,683
只要彎彎腰
But gettin' down

679
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:49,415
搖擺沒什麼難  只要彎彎腰
Boogie ain't nothing but getting down

680
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:52,488
搖擺沒什麼難
Boogie ain't nothing

681
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,322
只要彎彎腰
But getting down

682
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:56,828
我為你搖擺
I got to boogie for you

683
00:31:56,896 --> 00:32:03,494
我為你搖擺
I got to boogie for you

684
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,004
我就是想要擺
I got nothing but boogie

685
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,199
只想為你搖擺
Nothing but boogie for you

686
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:09,935
我就是想搖擺
I got nothing but boogie

687
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,442
只想為你搖擺
Nothing but boogie for you

688
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:14,173
搖擺  搖擺  搖擺  搖擺
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

689
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,545
搖擺  搖擺  搖擺  搖擺
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

690
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,311
搖擺  搖擺  搖擺  搖擺
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

691
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:20,215
我為你搖擺
I got to boogie for you

692
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:31,420
有愛共享  寶貝
Share the love, baby.

693
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:35,529
你剛在台上做了招牌動作  對吧
You know you pulled the Al Green up there, right?

694
00:32:35,602 --> 00:32:37,297
我沒有  路  別提那個
No, I didn't, Lou. Don't start that...

695
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,496
我們剛剛下台
We barely got offstage

696
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:40,232
你就屁顛屁顛的跑回去了
when you ran your ass back out there.

697
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,900
要不要返場觀眾說了算
Look, an encore is at the audience's discretion.

698
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:44,534
你應該等他們要求再這麼做
You're supposed to wait till they ask for it.

699
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:46,306
-你知道他們想要返場  -我不關心他們想不想
- You know they wanted it.  - I don't care what they wanted.

700
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:48,142
你的行為太不專業了
That shit was unprofessional.

701
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:49,545
夥計
Man...

702
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,816
噢
Say,

703
00:32:54,888 --> 00:32:58,187
我記起為什麼我喜歡公路旅行啦
I'm starting to remember why I love the road so much.

704
00:32:58,258 --> 00:33:00,692
就是這個
Yeah.

705
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,892
如果我的直覺是正確的
If my instincts serve me right,

706
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:11,027
你今晚得給自己另開個房間了
you're about to find yourself another room tonight.

707
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:13,937
你知道那些藍色小藥丸會讓你失明  對吧
You know those little blue pills make you go blind, right?

708
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:19,968
你要是持續勃起  可別喊我救命
Don't call me when you get that four-hour erection.

709
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,570
來吧  小寶貝
Hey, now, baby girl.

710
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:27,178
來吧  來吧
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

711
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:30,280
給我吧
Yeah, give it to me.

712
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,349
小藥丸給我力量吧
Those little pills, give me strength.

713
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:34,586
一點就夠了
A little strength.

714
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:37,891
今晚一定讓你爽死
I'm going to fuck your brains out.

715
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:40,728
天啊  你真重
Oh! Oh, you're heavy.

716
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:46,764
怎麼了  寶貝
what's wrong, baby?

717
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,101
沒什麼
Nothing.

718
00:33:48,174 --> 00:33:51,473
我只是  我...
I just, uh, you know, I...

719
00:33:51,544 --> 00:33:53,739
我從來沒和像你這樣的人做過
I just never been with someone like you before.

720
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,475
傳說都是真的  但是讓我告訴你
It's true what they say.  But let me tell you something.

721
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:58,915
弗洛伊德·亨德森很好很溫柔
Floyd Henderson gonna be nice and gentle.

722
00:33:58,985 --> 00:34:00,680
你的第一個黑男人
Your first taste of dark meat

723
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:02,584
會讓你欲仙欲死  相信我
gonna be smooth and sweet, trust me.

724
00:34:02,655 --> 00:34:03,815
我不是說這個
No, I didn't mean that.

725
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,188
我只是
It's just, uh, you know,

726
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:09,592
從來沒和像你這麼老的人做過
I've never been with someone so old.

727
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:10,822
老
Old?

728
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:13,491
你他媽也不是什麼小女生
You ain't no teen queen your damn self.

729
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:18,428
別這樣  老婆子  過來  寶貝
Come on, mama. Come here, baby.

730
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:19,732
寶貝  寶貝  聽著
Baby, baby. Look here.

731
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:23,003
讓我們用上積攢了幾十年的性經驗
Let's take our decades of sexual experience

732
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:24,771
在這個探索與狂喜之夜
and combine them for one night

733
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:26,641
盡情結合  怎麼樣
of exploration and bliss, can we do that?

734
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:30,779
我不會讓你失望的
I won't disappoint you.

735
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,114
好吧
All right.

736
00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:35,245
這就是我所說的
That's what I'm talking about.

737
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,652
我要吃你的奶
I want to suck one of them titties.

738
00:34:36,723 --> 00:34:39,191
真的  我有東西讓你看
Oh, yeah? Well, I got something to show you.

739
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,621
我全身發熱  忍不住要搞我自己
I'm so hot, I'm about to fuck myself.

740
00:34:43,863 --> 00:34:44,887
使勁吻我
Bite my lip off.

741
00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:46,829
哎呀
Oh. Look!

742
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:48,332
來吧  我忍不住了  寶貝
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

743
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:49,993
今晚我得大干一場
Tonight I ain't got no control like that no more.

744
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:53,800
希望你不會介意毛太多
Now, I hope you don't mind a little hair.

745
00:34:53,873 --> 00:34:57,604
寶貝  60年代我就性覺醒了
Baby, I found my sexual awakening in the '60s.

746
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:01,204
我最喜歡又硬又多毛茸茸
Nothing I like better than a big old fluffy...

747
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:04,643
見鬼  娘們兒
Damn, girl.

748
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:06,651
你的陰毛可真是茂盛
That's a whole bunch of hair you got down there.

749
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,687
是吧  我把它稱作自然景觀
Yeah, I call it the natural look.

750
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,053
你那是有什麼毛病嗎
You sick?

751
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:12,921
我知道是多了一些
I know it's big.

752
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:14,584
你得剃掉點
You need a pick.

753
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,957
你想讓我先刮一刮嗎
You want me to shave it?

754
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:19,192
我們沒時間也沒工具去幹那活兒
We ain't got the time or apparatus for that type of job.

755
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:20,994
好吧  忽略這個問題
Okay, disregard.

756
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:26,028
看看誰來吃飯了
Look who's coming to dinner.

757
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:27,936
正是時候  對吧
Right on time, ain't it?

758
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:29,440
我絕對是個硬漢
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

759
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:32,302
你知道接下來我要做什麼嗎
You know what I'm gonna do for you?

760
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:33,777
你準備做什麼
What you fixing to do?

761
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,711
你曾有過絲絨滑過的感覺嗎
You ever had a velveteen rub?

762
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:38,148
絲絨滑過
A velveteen rub.

763
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:40,617
別用奶酪  可以嗎
Ain't... Ain't no cheese involved, is there?

764
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:42,586
因為我乳糖過敏
Because I'm lactose intolerant.

765
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:50,989
來吧
Oh, yeah.

766
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:02,565
你想掐死我的小弟弟嗎
You're choking my chicken!

767
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:20,359
昨晚一定和那個大胸女
That's quite a show you got going

768
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:22,394
上演了一場好戲吧  猛男
under the big top there, Sparky.

769
00:36:22,462 --> 00:36:23,929
搞的我不得不在半夜
I had to take another one of them damn pills

770
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:25,224
又吃了一次那該死的藥
in the middle of the night, man.

771
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:27,266
那個女人總是難以滿足  我簡直精疲力盡
This woman insatiable, man. I'm shooting dust.

772
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:30,234
弗洛伊德
Oh, Floyd.

773
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:31,429
寶貝  我在這
I'm right here, baby.

774
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:32,664
你準備好了再幹一場了嗎
You ready for some more?

775
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:33,762
是的  來吧
Yeah, come here.

776
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:38,538
過來
Come here.

777
00:36:39,712 --> 00:36:42,408
還有什麼話說  小子
Think about that, boy.

778
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:44,541
我的小種馬在這裡哪
There's my stallion.

779
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,613
-我想要你  -你想要我嗎
- I missed you. - Oh, you missed me?

780
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:50,823
你得讓這裡透透氣
Mmm. You need a little air on this thing.

781
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:55,254
你這個壞孩子
Oh, you bad boy.

782
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:56,955
該死的
God damn.

783
00:36:57,029 --> 00:36:58,587
你喜歡這樣嗎
You like that, huh?

784
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:00,256
我是你的小貓咪
I'm your little kitty cat.

785
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:04,636
是純真嗎
Chastity?

786
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:07,866
媽媽
Mama?

787
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,168
你這個小蕩婦
You little whore.

788
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:10,709
你自己不也一樣
You're one to talk.

789
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:13,176
你跟他搞得時候也把假牙拿出來了嗎
Oh, did you take out your teeth for him?

790
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:15,237
注意點和你媽說話的方式
You watch how you talk to your mama.

791
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:16,906
拜託  你沒資格教育我
Please, you can't talk to me like that.

792
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,041
你又不是我老子
You're not my daddy.

793
00:37:18,117 --> 00:37:19,141
說的好  那麼誰是你老子
That's right, who's your daddy?

794
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:20,344
-你是我老子  -你的大JJ老子
- You're my daddy. - Your big daddy.

795
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:23,211
洛莎莉  你在房間裡嗎
Rosalee, are you in there?

796
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:25,814
事實上  我老子在門口
Actually, that's my daddy.

797
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,520
老媽  你想什麼呢
What are you thinking, Mama?

798
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:31,620
你毀了這一切
You ruined everything.

799
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,756
-我恨你  -你這個乳臭未乾小騷貨
- I hate you.  - You little brat.

800
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,926
你這個骯髒的...好吧  我愛你
You're a dirty...All right, I love you.

801
00:37:36,002 --> 00:37:37,526
要常給我打電話
Call me a lot of times.

802
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:39,901
老媽  你哪根筋不對
Mama, what is wrong with you?

803
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,202
我再重申一遍  你是個蕩婦
I renounce you. You're a whore.

804
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,038
我是蕩婦
I'm a whore?

805
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,635
你和那個黑鬼讓我們全家蒙羞
You just shamed the whole family, you and the black man.

806
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:51,346
蕩婦
Whoa!

807
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,282
真是太有趣了
Whoo! That was fun.

808
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:03,186
快來  牽起我的手
So come, take me by the hand

809
00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:05,196
一同離開這片煩惱之地
We'll leave this troubled land

810
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:06,822
我知道我們可以
I know we can

811
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:08,127
我知道我們可以
I know we can

812
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:09,395
我會下地獄的  夥計
I'll be damned, man.

813
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:11,231
那倆婊子偷了我們的錢  夥計
Them broads stole our money, man.

814
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:15,272
但那是她們應得的
but they earned it.

815

977
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,599
在哥們面前你說我瘋折騰
You gonna talk to me crazy in front of my boys?

978
00:44:23,676 --> 00:44:25,906
你還說什麼啊  給我閉嘴

對  他一無所知
That's right, he don't know shit.

999
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,122

當我們沒爭你媽的時候
Well, when we wasn't fighting over your mother,

1014
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:01,200
唱片賣得不好

她可沒空
She ain't got time to be ripping,

1032
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,453
跟兩個老黑鬼在路上顛簸
running up and down the road with two old niggers.

1033
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,988
為什麼不能
Why not?

1034
00:46:51,056 --> 00:46:53,616

路易斯
Hey, Louis.

1038
00:47:10,642 --> 00:47:13,702
克里奧告訴我
You know, Cleo was telling me

1039
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:15,804
奧黛特從沒跟她談起過她父親
that Odetta never told her nothing about her father,

1040
00:47:15,881 --> 00:47:18,145
名字都沒提過
not even his name.

1041
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:19,980
但她提過他是個音樂家
But she did say he was a musician.

1042
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:21,576
你沒跟那女孩瞎說八道吧
You ain't said nothing stupid to the girl, have you?

1043
00:47:21,653 --> 00:47:22,745
比如
Like what?

1044
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:25,619
比如
Oh, like, uh,

1045
00:47:25,691 --> 00:47:26,919
克里奧  我是你爸爸
Cleo, you know, I'm your daddy.

1046
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:29,654
我還要再搞清楚狀況
Well, I'm still feeling out the situation.

1047
00:47:29,728 --> 00:47:30,990
那你他媽幹嗎說
What the fuck was that

1048
00:47:31,063 --> 00:47:32,690
你應該跟我們去孟斐斯啊
that "You ought to come to Memphis with us" shit?

1049
00:47:32,765 --> 00:47:36,098
那樣說  會種下禍根
Now that, right there, that's a recipe for disaster.

1050
00:47:36,168 --> 00:47:39,433
路易斯  路易斯  我知道你肯定很難過
Louis, Louis, I know this ain't easy for you.

1051
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:41,973
但是我從沒想過我有孩子
But I never thought I'd have a child.

1052
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,837
現在我也開始生生不息了
Now I'm part of this big old circle called life.

1053
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:48,903
弗洛伊德·亨德森也許真有子孫後代
A piece of Floyd Henderson, man, might be here to live on,

1054
00:47:48,981 --> 00:47:50,414
也許會永傳萬代
and maybe forever.

1055
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:52,347
再不閉嘴睡覺
If you don't shut up and go to sleep,

1056
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:53,741
混蛋弗洛伊德·亨德森
A big piece of Floyd Henderson ass

1057

可能明天就醒不了了
Might not wake up in the morning.

1058

我很佩服你
I respect the fact that you want

1060
00:47:59,324 --> 00:48:01,724
能用怒火掩蓋痛苦
to cloak your pain with your anger.

1061
00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:10,625
晚安
Good night.

1062
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:19,443
這他媽是什麼
Oh, hey! What the fuck is that?

1063
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:20,569
怎麼了
What's wrong?

1064
00:48:20,646 --> 00:48:22,238
你又吃了那壯陽藥了
You been taking them dick pills again?

1065
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:24,680
是降低膽固醇的藥  是吃了
I though it was my cholesterol meds, I swear I did.

1066
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,014
你也不能沉迷於那玩意啊
You can't be spooning with a motherfucker with that!

1067
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:28,245
你什麼毛病啊
What's wrong with you?

1068
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,845

給我點蓋的  我去地上睡
Give me some covers. I'm gonna sleep on the floor.

1070
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:33,549

1071
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:35,149
去吧  地上睡吧
Go on, then. Sleep on the floor.

1072
00:48:35,227 --> 00:48:36,285
誰也不喜歡你  路易斯
Nobody wants you, Louis.

1073
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:38,261
我也不喜歡娘娘腔
I don't like boy pussy no way.

1074
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,797
疼死你的背
I hope your back hurt like a motherfucker.

1075
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:42,299
起碼背疼比被戳屁眼好
Better my back than my asshole.

1076
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:44,460
噁心  掄死你個狗娘養的
Nasty... I'll beat your motherfucking...

1077
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:46,436
我在監獄呆那麼多年
All them years I spent in prison,

1078
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:48,439
沒人敢對我這樣
ain't nobody roll up on me like that.

1079
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:50,099
我正想問你
I was going to ask you about that.

1080
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,473
你真該慚愧得要死
You ought to be ashamed of your goddamn self,

1081
00:48:52,544 --> 00:48:53,977
噁心的混蛋
nasty son of a bitch.

1082
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,722
好似我從未有
Like I never had

1083
00:49:21,506 --> 00:49:24,475
當我傷心時

Right there.

1220
00:55:42,788 --> 00:55:44,278
去死  路易斯
Go to hell, Louis.

1221
00:55:44,356 --> 00:55:47,325
亨德森先生
Mr. Henderson?

1222
00:55:47,392 --> 00:55:48,859
是的
It is I.

1223
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:57,226
麻煩您稍等一下
Will you excuse me for just a minute, please?

1224
00:55:57,302 --> 00:55:58,462
好的
Okay.

1225
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:05,136
-對不起  亨德森先生  -亨德森
- Ahh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Henderson, - Henderson.

1226
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:07,007
我們不能讓您住在這兒
We're unable to accommodate you.

1227
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:09,103
也許我們可以為您推薦其它旅館
Perhaps we could recommend another hotel.

1228
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:10,773
為什麼  夥計  我在孟菲斯
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

1229
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:12,180
我要住在皮博迪
I want to stay at the Peabody.

1230
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,810
當然  先生  您之前住過這兒
Yes, sir, I understand you've stayed with us before,

1231
00:56:14,886 --> 00:56:16,285
可這就是問題所在
and apparently, that's the problem.

1232
00:56:16,354 --> 00:56:18,618
似乎上次您住這兒的時候
It seems that the last time you stayed here...

1233
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,853
準確說是1978年3月12日
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

1234
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:24,896
您辦了個聚會  期間  您住的房間
you hosted a party, during which the room

1235
00:56:24,963 --> 00:56:26,828
以及酒店的幾個其他地方
and several other areas of the hotel

1236
00:56:26,898 --> 00:56:29,230
遭到了大面積的破壞
sustained extensive damage.

1237
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:31,462
我怎麼不記得這回事兒
I don't recollect nothing like that.

1238
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:33,401
我想是斯萊和布特西
I think that's the night Sly and Bootsy

1239
00:56:33,471 --> 00:56:35,029
帶吞火魔術師來的那個晚上
came by with the fire-eater.

1240
00:56:35,106 --> 00:56:37,438
是玩蛇的那個人
Is that the one with the snake?

1241
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:39,443
就是他
That's the one.

1242
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:41,342
也許你可以用路易斯·海因茲的名字
Perhaps you could put those rooms

1243
00:56:41,342 --> 00:56:43,174
訂房看看
in the name of Louis Hinds.

1244
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:44,510
沒錯
Yeah, perhaps.

1245
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,608
路易斯·海因茲  我們試試看
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

1246
00:56:54,092 --> 00:56:56,026
對不起  琳達  讓你看到這些了
I'm sorry you had to see that, Linda.

1247
00:56:56,094 --> 00:56:57,823
怎麼啦  我看看
What's on there? Let me see that shit.

1248
00:56:57,896 --> 00:57:00,023
我要看看到底怎麼了
I want to see what's on there.

1249
00:57:00,098 --> 00:57:02,896
我要四個房間  先生
I need four rooms, Don.

1250
00:57:02,968 --> 00:57:04,902
你們最好的客房
Your best available.

1251
00:57:20,986 --> 00:57:22,476
夥計們
Oh, hey, guys.

1252
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:24,647
裁縫給了我幾件今晚的演出服
Your tailor gave me several choices for tonight.

1253
00:57:24,723 --> 00:57:26,691
他說他大約7點半到
He said he's going to stop by around 7:30.

1254
00:57:26,758 --> 00:57:27,816
那是什麼
What the fuck?

1255
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:29,588
你跑去打劫花花公子商場購物了
Did you catch the sale over at the Build-A-Pimp?

1256
00:57:29,661 --> 00:57:31,822
你喜歡這個嗎  很棒吧
You like that? It's fly, huh?

1257
00:57:31,897 --> 00:57:34,525
這樣穿很時髦
It's a get-down, get-down. It's live. It's funky.

1258
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:36,191
我想應該找幾個保姆
And I think I'm going to get some poonanny.

1259
00:57:36,268 --> 00:57:37,758
說實話
To be honest with you,

1260
00:57:37,836 --> 00:57:40,202
自從電視開播《老友記》  我就沒泡過妞
I haven't been laid since Friends was on television.

1261
00:57:40,272 --> 00:57:41,534
今晚我要好好享受
So this is my night.

1262
00:57:41,606 --> 00:57:44,166
你確定他不是你的孩子嗎
You sure that ain't one of your children?

1263
00:57:46,945 --> 00:57:48,207
今晚你會唱得很棒的
You gonna sing real nice tonight.

1264
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,440
女歌手是誰
Who's the girl singer?

1265
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:56,376
噢  天  看啊  夥計
Oh, my goodness! Look at here! Oh, man.

1266
00:57:56,454 --> 00:57:57,580
你好  路易斯  很高興見到你
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

1267
00:57:57,656 --> 00:57:58,748
你好嗎  夥計
You good, man?

1268
00:58:05,931 --> 00:58:07,023
你看起來不錯
Hey, good-looking.

1269
00:58:07,098 --> 00:58:09,589
克勞德特  你好嗎  小妞兒
Claudette. How you doing, girl?

1270
00:58:09,668 --> 00:58:11,226
我知道你不會還在對
I know you still ain't upset

1271
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:12,600
在巴爾的摩所發生的事難過
about what happened in Baltimore that...

1272
00:58:12,671 --> 00:58:14,696
你犯什麼毛病  娘們兒
Oh! What's wrong with you, woman?

1273
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:17,173
直接下地獄去吧  弗洛伊德·亨德森
You going straight to hell, Floyd Henderson.

1274
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:19,972
你笑什麼
What you laughing at?

1275
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:22,912
-也想來一下嗎  -不
- You want some, too? - No.

1276
00:58:22,981 --> 00:58:23,948
去你媽的
Fuck you.

1277
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,311
去你媽的  去你媽的
Fuck you, fuck you

1278
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:29,046
這下我們沒有女歌手了
Now we have no girl singer.

1279
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,054
我們找人代替不就行了
We just got to find a replacement, that's all.

1280
00:58:31,122 --> 00:58:32,282
時間不夠了
It's too late.

1281
00:58:33,325 --> 00:58:34,587
克里奧
Cleo.

1282
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:36,456
你會唱我們所有的歌  對吧
You know all our songs, right?

1283
00:58:36,528 --> 00:58:39,429
別介意我直說  夥計
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

1284
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:41,158
我不和不入流的票友一起演出
but I'm not playing with no rank amateur.

1285
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:43,564
別這樣  沃夫曼  她不是不入流的票友
Come on, Wolfman, this ain't no rank amateur, man.

1286
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:45,296
夥計  她是奧黛特·惠特菲爾德的女兒
This Odetta Whitfield's daughter, man.

1287
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,496
還沒出名而以
Ain't got to recognize.

1288
00:58:46,571 --> 00:58:49,062
真是的  那我們開始吧  寶貝
Shit. Let's roll, then, baby.

1289
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:53,607
她會唱歌吧
She can sing, can't she?

1290
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:07,848
我們開始
Here we go.

1291
00:59:13,932 --> 00:59:17,333
如果音樂讓你起舞
If music makes you move

1292
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:19,768
你就盡情享受
You can really groove

1293
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:26,307
享受
Groove on

1294
00:59:26,378 --> 00:59:29,394
如果你真的想熱戀
If you feel like you want to make love

1295
00:59:29,394 --> 00:59:32,411
就在滿天繁星下
under the stars above

1296
00:59:32,484 --> 00:59:34,418
熱戀
Love on

如果你真的有話要說
If there's something that you wanna say

1299
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,086
卻又找不到出路
And talking is the hard way

1300
00:59:45,163 --> 00:59:52,028
說唱
Rap on

1301
00:59:52,103 --> 00:59:57,102
因為無論是什麼  只要你想做
'Cause whatever you want to do

1302
00:59:57,175 --> 01:00:00,611
你就應該勇往直前
You got to do your thing

1303
01:00:05,984 --> 01:00:07,576
如果你真的想吶喊
If you feel like you want to scream

1304
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,754
如果這是你怒氣在釋放
If that's your way you let off steam

1305
01:00:10,822 --> 01:00:12,312
吶喊

如果你真的想歌唱
If you feel like you want to sing

1308
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:23,598
因為唱歌就是你所想
'Cause singing is your thing

1309
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:25,636
歌唱
Sing on

你就應該勇往直前
You got to do your thing

1317
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:03,800
我是這樂隊的  是的  這是一支夢幻般的樂隊
I'm with the band. Yeah, it's a dream.

1318
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,866
是的  就是一支夢幻般的樂隊
Yeah, it's a... it's a total dream.

1319
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:09,478
我彈哈姆菲卡
I play the harmuffica.

1320
01:01:13,718 --> 01:01:14,980
我幫你看著位子
I'll save you a seat.

1321
01:01:15,053 --> 01:01:21,553
因為無論是什麼  只要你想做
'Cause whatever you want to do

1322
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:25,995
太棒啦  寶貝兒
Yeah, baby, oh

1323
01:01:28,032 --> 01:01:31,729
你就應該勇往直前
You got to do your thing

1324
01:01:51,089 --> 01:01:54,616
今晚是我一生中最瘋狂的一晚
This is the most insane night of my life.

1325
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:56,489
艾薩克想讓我去他的工作室
You know Isaac wants to put me in his studio?

1326
01:01:56,561 --> 01:01:59,894
他說他有一首歌非常適合我唱
He says he's got a song that'd be perfect for me.

1327
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:01,932
噢  真的嗎
Oh, he does, does he?

1328
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,299
別這樣  不是你想的那樣
Uh... Come on, now. It ain't like that.

1329
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,133
總會是那樣的
Oh, it's always like that,

1330
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:08,695
就像電影裡演的
like movies.

1331
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:12,642
好吧  我會小心點的
Well, I'll be careful.

1332
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,440
只是擔心你而已  沒別的
Just trying to look out for you, that's all.

1333
01:02:16,447 --> 01:02:20,645
謝謝你們為我做的一切
Thanks, guys, for everything.

1334
01:02:22,987 --> 01:02:26,821
你就應該勇往直前

如果你真的想熱戀
If you feel like making love

1337

因為這是你所想
'Cause that's your thing

1338
01:02:40,405 --> 01:02:43,101
很棒
Right on

1339
01:02:43,174 --> 01:02:45,574
夥計  這不是正拳組合的車嗎
Man, ain't that the Real Deal car?

1340
01:02:45,643 --> 01:02:47,770
那當然  朋友  你是歌迷
Sure is, homie. You a fan?

1341
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:53,382
是的  我是超級歌迷
Hell, yeah. I'm a big fan.

1342
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:54,975
你知道他們在哪兒嗎
You know where they at?

1343
01:02:55,053 --> 01:02:56,486
因為我要找他們訴訴苦
'Cause I need to holler at 'em.

1344
01:02:56,554 --> 01:02:59,990
說實話我是他們的經紀人
Actually, I'm their manager.

1345
01:03:00,058 --> 01:03:03,323
真的  他們的經紀人
Really? Their manager?

1346
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:09,898
等一下
Hold on a minute.

1347
01:03:13,271 --> 01:03:15,296
弗洛伊德
Oh, hi, Floyd.

1348
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:17,432
進來吧  看看這地方
Come on in. Check this place out.

1349
01:03:17,508 --> 01:03:18,736
我會習慣上這裡的
I could get used to this.

1350
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,175
我肯定你會的
I'll bet you could.

1351
01:03:20,245 --> 01:03:21,405
喝一杯吧
Let me get you a drink.

1352
01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:22,605
好的  給我來一杯
Yeah, I'll take one.

1353
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,942
等等  先別去倒酒
But hold on, before you do that,

1354
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:25,607
有件事想和你說
there's something I want to say to you.

1355
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:27,583
是讓你吃驚的事情
It's been a blast connecting with you.

1356
01:03:27,652 --> 01:03:28,914
我想你該知道這件事
I want you to know that.

1357
01:03:28,987 --> 01:03:30,420
你真好
That's sweet of you.

1358
01:03:30,488 --> 01:03:31,750
如果你有什麼需要
And if you need anything,

1359
01:03:31,823 --> 01:03:33,017
比如錢什麼的
like money or something like that,

1360
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:35,855
直接告訴我
don't you hesitate to call me now.

1361
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:36,956
不是因為錢能彌補
Not that money gonna make up for

1362
01:03:36,956 --> 01:03:37,986
我們沒有在一起的日子
the lost time between us

1363
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:39,529
或是別的什麼
or nothing like that.

1364
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:40,859
逝去的日子
Lost time?

1365
01:03:40,932 --> 01:03:41,956
你要理解
You have to understand,

1366
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:45,127
奧黛特從來沒有告訴過我有關你的事
Odetta never told me nothing about you.

1367
01:03:45,203 --> 01:03:46,966
如果我一開始就知道有你
Had I known about you from the beginning,

1368
01:03:47,038 --> 01:03:48,300
我會在你身邊的
I'd have been here from the start.

1369
01:03:48,373 --> 01:03:49,635
-弗洛伊德  -她從沒向我提過你的事
- Floyd... - She never said nothing to me about you.

1370
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:50,969
弗洛伊德  你不是我父親
You're not my father, Floyd.

1371
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:52,475
你沒在聽我說
You're not listening.

1372
01:03:52,543 --> 01:03:54,135
你的事  什麼  你說什麼
See, the thing you... what's that? Say what?

1373
01:03:54,212 --> 01:03:55,770
你不是我父親
You're not my father.

1374
01:03:55,847 --> 01:03:57,576
我不是
I- I'm not?

1375
01:03:57,649 --> 01:03:58,946
你不是
No.

1376
01:03:59,017 --> 01:04:00,609
你怎麼知道
How do you know?

1377
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:02,983
因為我父親知道我
Because he knows who I am

1378
01:04:03,054 --> 01:04:04,544
或者他曾經知道我
Or he did.

1379
01:04:04,622 --> 01:04:05,884
我是說  就我所知
I mean, for all I know,

1380
01:04:05,957 --> 01:04:07,185
他可能已經死了
he could be dead.

1381
01:04:08,626 --> 01:04:11,595
每過一段時間   他會寄錢給我
I get a little money from him every once in a while.

1382
01:04:11,663 --> 01:04:14,393
是他許多年前設立的保密委託
It's a blind trust he set up years ago.

1383
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:16,592
錢從他的音樂版稅來
Something to do with his music royalties.

1384
01:04:16,668 --> 01:04:19,398
音樂版稅
Music royalties?

1385
01:04:24,242 --> 01:04:26,142
你上了我老婆  你這混賬東西
You knocked up my wife, motherfucker.

1386
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:29,338
你先從我這偷走她的
Ooh. You stole her from me first.

1387
01:04:29,414 --> 01:04:31,279
你發什麼瘋
What is wrong with you?

1388
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:34,281
你失去了你的...
You lost your...

1389
01:04:34,352 --> 01:04:35,785
你沒和克里奧說吧
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

1390
01:04:35,853 --> 01:04:37,286
沒有  我沒告訴她
No, I didn't tell her.

1391
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:38,686
雖然我應該告訴她
I should've told her, though.

1392
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:41,020
你一定笑翻了吧
I'll bet you laughing your ass off, wasn't you?

1393
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:42,559
四處散佈說我才是那女孩的父親
Going around, talking about I'm the girl's daddy

1394
01:04:42,627 --> 01:04:45,460
還有生生不息之類的廢話
and big round circle of life, all that bullshit.

1395
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:46,963
笑吧  笑吧  混賬東西
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

1396
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:48,692
就那麼一點點
Well, just a little bit.

1397
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:51,966
弗洛伊德
Floyd...

1398
01:04:52,036 --> 01:04:53,799
聽著  弗洛伊德
Look, Floyd...

1399
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:55,065
弗洛伊德  放下  放下
Floyd, put it down. Put it down!

1400
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:57,733
兄弟  別這樣
Dawg, come on!

1401
01:04:57,809 --> 01:04:59,401
住手  不然你會受傷的
You need to quit before you get hurt.

1402
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:05,081
聽著  弗洛伊德
Look, Floyd,

1403
01:05:05,149 --> 01:05:07,083
我不是故意的  行了吧
I didn't mean for it to happen, all right?

1404
01:05:07,151 --> 01:05:08,448
你知道她是什麼人
You know how she was.

1405
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:11,849
拉我一把
Come here.

1406
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:13,481
好了  夥計  別再犯傻了
Come on, man. Stop acting a fool.

1407
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:15,950
你沒事吧
You all right?

1408
01:05:16,027 --> 01:05:17,961
混蛋  別再犯傻了
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

1409
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,359
去你大爺的
Fucking dad!

1410
01:05:24,435 --> 01:05:26,995
你他媽的又什麼不對了
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1411
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:51,390
暫停
Time out.

1412
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:57,598
夥計  嘗到我那一拳的利害了吧
Still got a little pop in your punch there, partner.

1413
01:05:57,668 --> 01:05:59,795
嘗嘗這一拳  混賬
Pop this, motherfucker!

1414
01:06:03,107 --> 01:06:05,041
混蛋
Shit. Ugh.

1415
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:08,344
你這個混賬東西居然打我的蛋蛋
You dirty motherfucker, hitting me in the nuts.

1416
01:06:08,413 --> 01:06:10,711
混蛋
Ooh! Shit.

1417
01:06:10,782 --> 01:06:14,650
路易斯  不可能一直是你扁我
Louis, you just can't keep whooping on my ass.

1418
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,812
我也是他媽的男子漢  寶貝
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

1419
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:18,412
我也是他媽的男子漢
I'm a motherfucking man.

1420
01:06:21,526 --> 01:06:24,620
路易斯  你怎麼能不去看你女兒呢
Louis, how come you won't see your own daughter?

1421
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,712
混蛋  我想去看她
Oh, motherfucker, I wanted to see her,

1422
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:29,281
但是
but, you know...

1423
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:32,260
是時機  過一段時間以後
It's time... After a while,

1424
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:35,355
就變得  就變得難以承受
you know, it's just... it's just too much.

1425
01:06:35,432 --> 01:06:37,195
奧黛特為什麼不告訴她
Why didn't O tell her?

1426
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,792
夥計  奧黛特為什麼不告訴她
Why didn't Odetta tell her, man?

1427
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,803
讓她說什麼
What was she going to tell her, huh?

1428
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:44,568
說她父親是個又酗酒又吸毒的人渣
That her daddy was a alcoholic dopehead convict

1429
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:46,973
說她父親一事無成
that fucked up everything he touched, hmm?

1430
01:06:47,043 --> 01:06:48,135
不行  不行
No, no.

1431
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:50,042
沒有我她過得更好
She was better off without me.

1432
01:06:50,113 --> 01:06:51,580
混蛋
Oh, shit.

1433
01:06:51,648 --> 01:06:52,706
不管怎樣  一切都太晚了
Anyhow, it's too late now.

1434
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,375
遇見她是個錯誤
It was a mistake getting to know her.

1435
01:06:56,453 --> 01:06:58,114
-路  -怎麼啦

1436
01:06:58,188 --> 01:06:59,553
你怎麼了  發病了

1437
01:06:59,623 --> 01:07:01,921

你真的在音樂圈工作
You really in the music business?

1447
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:22,837
幹嗎  你有帶子需要混音
Why, do you have a mix tape?

1448
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,403
你他媽的給我閉嘴  白小子
Shut the fuck up, white boy!

1449
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:26,813
還有別再流那麼多汗
And stop sweating so goddamn much.

1450
01:07:26,883 --> 01:07:28,407
你聞起來像臘肉
You smell like bacon.

1451
01:07:28,485 --> 01:07:30,419
而我吃素
And I'm a Muslim on Saturdays.

1452
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:32,478
你哪根筋不對
Fucking wrong with you, huh?

1453
01:07:32,556 --> 01:07:34,683
明明是白人卻留非洲人的頭髮
How you white and got a afro?

1454
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,715
一點兒也不帥
That ain't cool.

1455
01:07:36,792 --> 01:07:38,054

01:09:06,873 --> 01:09:07,999
去你媽的
Fuck you! Aah!

1493
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:09,837
你聽見了嗎
You hear that?

1494
01:09:09,909 --> 01:09:12,275
崩了這個混蛋  路易斯
Shoot that motherfucker, Louis.

1495
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:16,643
舉起手來
Get your hands up!

1496
01:09:17,735 --> 01:09:20,533
我舉不起來  夥計  我胳膊打著繃帶
I can't, nigger. My arm's in a brace.

1497
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:23,368
放下武器  快點
Drop the weapon now! Come on!

1498
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:30,776
我是第一次進這種地方
This is my first time ever being in here.

1499
01:09:30,848 --> 01:09:32,247
安靜點
Quiet, please.

1500
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:36,921
摩菲爾監獄  距離演唱會還有一 天

1501
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:39,918
這個骯髒的地方
This filthy-ass motherfucking place,

1502
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:41,548
弄的我渾身發癢
man, got me itching.

1503
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,192
看守
Yo, turnkey!

1504
01:09:45,262 --> 01:09:46,957
快點放我出去
Come on and let me out of this motherfucker!

1505
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:49,295
你應該面對現實
You might want to wrap your mind around the fact

1506
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:50,492
現實就是我們要錯過演出了
that we're gonna miss that show.

1507
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:52,297
你他媽說什麼  夥計
Fuck you talking about, man?

1508
01:09:52,369 --> 01:09:54,997
明晚我們一定要到紐約
We gotta be in New York tomorrow night.

1509
01:09:55,072 --> 01:09:56,835
不包括我
Uh-uh. Not me.

1510
01:09:56,907 --> 01:09:58,135
我受夠了  精疲力竭
I've had enough. I'm done.

1511
01:09:58,209 --> 01:10:00,234
什麼  你要丟下我一個人  路易斯
What, you're walking out on me, Louis?

1512
01:10:00,311 --> 01:10:02,609
聽著  佛洛德  在你到我家之前
Look, Floyd, I was doing just fine

1513
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,977
我還好好的
before you showed up at my door.

1514
01:10:04,048 --> 01:10:05,345
你應該感謝我
That's the thanks I get

1515
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:06,883
把你從破老鼠洞裡救出來
for pulling you out of that fucking rat hole.

1516
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:08,213
你本來應該坐在那兒
You was just sitting up in there,

1517
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:09,479
坐在那兒等死
just sitting there waiting to die.

1518
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:10,679
拜託  黑鬼
Negro, please.

1519
01:10:10,754 --> 01:10:12,346
你比我好不到哪去
You ain't no different from me,

1520
01:10:12,423 --> 01:10:15,051
你侄子把你這老年痴呆趕走
Especially since your nephew put your senile ass out to pasture

1521
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:16,286
還搶了你生意
and stole your business.

1522
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,191
混蛋  路易斯
Fuck you, Louis.

1523
01:10:18,262 --> 01:10:21,322
快滾回你的破老鼠洞吧
Crawl back under that damn rock you've been living.

1524
01:10:21,398 --> 01:10:22,922
我不需要你
I don't need you.

1525
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,025
我自己能搞定
I'll do this shit by my damn self.

1526
01:10:25,102 --> 01:10:28,594
看守
Yo! Turnkey!

1527
01:10:28,672 --> 01:10:30,435
讓我從這個鬼地方出去
Come on and let me out of this motherfucker.

1528
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:32,271
我受夠了  我要見律師
I've had enough, man. I want my lawyer.

1529
01:10:32,343 --> 01:10:33,367
放鬆  放鬆
Relax, relax.

1530
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:35,378
你不需要律師了
You ain't gonna need no lawyer.

1531
01:10:35,446 --> 01:10:37,573
目擊者證實了你的說辭
Witnesses say your story checks out,

1532
01:10:37,648 --> 01:10:40,378
所以  先生  你可以走了
so you, sir, are good to go.

1533
01:10:41,418 --> 01:10:43,852
太好了
Yeah.

1534
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:46,389
等等  搖滾小子
Whoa. Hold on there, Chuck Berry.

1535
01:10:46,457 --> 01:10:48,687
你可能需要請個律師
You're gonna need a lawyer.

1536
01:10:48,759 --> 01:10:52,490
你越過州界違反了假釋條款
Seems crossing state lines is in violation of his parole,

1537
01:10:52,563 --> 01:10:54,531
更別說持有槍支
Not to mention possession of firearms

1538
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:55,895
和無照駕駛
and driving without a license.

1539
01:10:55,966 --> 01:10:57,024
無照
No license?

1540
01:10:58,269 --> 01:10:59,531
借一步說話
Step back for a minute.

1541
01:11:01,305 --> 01:11:03,705
希望你爛死在這兒
I hope your ass rot up in here,

1542
01:11:03,774 --> 01:11:05,742
你他媽的罪有應得
you criminal-bound motherfucker, you.

1543
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:10,974
老子曰  "不欲以靜  天下將自定"
As Lao-Tzu says, "Let things flow forward as they may. "

1544
01:11:11,048 --> 01:11:13,380
那我就順其自然了  寶貝
And I'm gonna let it flow, too, baby.

1545
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:17,648
我也給你點亞非後裔哲學  朋友
And I got some Blackanese philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

1546
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:20,212
你能矇混  但是沒法逃脫  路
You get by, Lou, but you don't get away.

1547
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,555
黃泥巴掉到褲襠裡  不是屎也是屎
You sit in shit, you start to smell like it,

1548
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:24,184
所以自己小心別沾上
so check the crack of your ass.

1549
01:11:24,261 --> 01:11:26,422
還有些東西給你
Here's something else for you.

1550
01:11:26,497 --> 01:11:28,624
這是她的號碼
Here go her number.

1551
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:32,192
給她打電話吧  老爸
Call her... Daddy.

1552
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:35,099
去死吧
Fuck him, man!

1553
01:11:35,172 --> 01:11:36,935
我得快點離開這個鬼地方
Let's get on out of this motherfucker.

1554
01:11:37,007 --> 01:11:39,339
他啥也不是
He ain't worth two damn flies smashed.

1555
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:42,737
這個黑鬼
Nigger.

1556
01:12:04,568 --> 01:12:06,502
我能打個電話嗎
Can I make a phone call?

1557
01:12:22,253 --> 01:12:24,448
你要丟下我一個人  路易斯
You walking out on me, Louis?

1558
01:12:24,521 --> 01:12:25,886
我受夠了  精疲力盡
I've had enough. I'm done.

1559
01:12:25,956 --> 01:12:27,423
你沒事吧  夥計
You all right, man?

1560
01:12:27,491 --> 01:12:28,981
是的  是的  我很好
Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.

1561
01:12:29,059 --> 01:12:30,617
你一點也不好  呼吸都困難
You're not all right. You can't hardly breathe.

1562
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:32,594
你需要做胸部X光檢查
You need a chest X-ray.

1563
01:12:32,663 --> 01:12:34,858
我不想復出
I ain't trying to make no comeback.

1564
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:36,524
我已經離開  就不想回去
I'm gone, and I want to stay gone.

1565
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,897
你應該感謝我
That's the thanks I get

1566
01:12:37,968 --> 01:12:39,230
把你從破老鼠洞裡救出來
for pulling you out of that rat hole,

1567
01:12:39,303 --> 01:12:40,429
坐在那等死
just sitting there waiting to die...

1568
01:12:40,504 --> 01:12:42,096
坐在那等死
sitting there waiting to die...

1569
01:12:42,172 --> 01:12:43,730
- 死  死  - 太晚了
- die, die...  - It's too late.

1570
01:12:43,807 --> 01:12:45,468
在座的有醫生嗎
Is there a doctor in the house?

1571
01:12:47,478 --> 01:12:49,844
抓緊時間
Keep it short.

1572
01:12:51,415 --> 01:12:54,145
我是克里奧  請留言
It's Cleo. Please leave a message.

1573
01:12:57,288 --> 01:13:01,622
克里奧  我是路易斯
Cleo... um, this is, uh, Louis.

1574
01:13:01,692 --> 01:13:03,592
路易斯·海因茲
Louis Hinds.

1575
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:05,026
你父親
Your father.

1576
01:13:06,297 --> 01:13:09,164
這麼說有點奇怪
Wow, um, feels funny saying that.

1577
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:11,394
我以前從沒這麼說過
I've, um, I've never said it before.

1578
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:14,737
聽著
Listen.

1579
01:13:16,774 --> 01:13:18,969
我沒別的意思
I didn't mean what I said.

1580
01:13:19,043 --> 01:13:20,408
我只是
I was...

1581
01:13:23,414 --> 01:13:26,850
奧黛塔是我生命中的最愛
Odetta was the love of my life.

1582
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:28,714
對我來說最糟糕的
The worst thing that ever happened to me

1583
01:13:28,786 --> 01:13:32,517
就是失去你們
was losing her and you.

1584
01:13:32,589 --> 01:13:33,920
但是你現在這麼優秀
But you turned out great.

1585
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:37,256
她把你教育得很好
She did a wonderful job with you.

1586
01:13:37,328 --> 01:13:40,092
你媽媽是個了不起的女人
You know your mother was an amazing woman.

1587
01:13:40,164 --> 01:13:41,688
我只想告訴你
And I just want you to know

1588
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:46,828
我非常  非常高興見到你
I'm really, really glad I met you.

1589
01:13:46,904 --> 01:13:47,996
我希望我
And I wish I...

1590
01:13:58,182 --> 01:13:59,581
好啦
All right.

1591
01:14:08,092 --> 01:14:10,822
你他媽的知道自己在幹什麼嗎
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1592
01:14:11,895 --> 01:14:13,385
把你救出監獄
Busting your ass out of jail.

1593
01:14:13,464 --> 01:14:15,694
你看我像在幹什麼
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?

1594
01:14:15,766 --> 01:14:17,097
後退  宅男  把鑰匙拿出來
Back up, Red. Get your keys out.

1595
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:18,156
打開牢門  懂嗎
Open that cell, okay?

1596
01:14:18,235 --> 01:14:19,361
長官  別聽他的
Deputy, don't listen to him.

1597
01:14:19,436 --> 01:14:21,802
他不會開槍的  至少打不中
He will not shoot you. Not on purpose anyway.

1598
01:14:21,872 --> 01:14:24,340
別被他騙了  宅男
Don't let him get you fucked up, Red.

1599
01:14:24,408 --> 01:14:25,841
我會毫不猶豫地開槍
I'll kill you disco-dead.

1600
01:14:25,909 --> 01:14:28,139
打開牢門  先生
Now open that doggone cell, man.

1601
01:14:28,212 --> 01:14:30,442
別抖  否則我也會抖
Stop shaking. If you shake, I'm gonna start shaking.

1602
01:14:30,514 --> 01:14:31,811
接下來你知道怎麼做
Next thing you know, kapow!

1603
01:14:31,882 --> 01:14:33,110
進去
Go on in.

1604
01:14:33,183 --> 01:14:34,241
現在把鑰匙給他
Now hand him the keys.

1605
01:14:34,318 --> 01:14:36,013
快給他
Hand them to him.

1606
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:37,519
-好了嗎  -弗洛伊德
- Okay?  - Floyd.

1607
01:14:37,588 --> 01:14:39,249
你真的要這麼做
You sure you want to do this?

1608
01:14:39,323 --> 01:14:41,791
是不是每件事都要跟我爭
Does everything gotta be a fucking argument with you?

1609
01:14:41,859 --> 01:14:43,224
該死的  快出來
God damn! Come on out of there!

1610
01:14:43,293 --> 01:14:45,193
關門  路  鎖上
Close the door, Lou. Lock it up.

1611
01:14:45,262 --> 01:14:47,594
我是人質
I'm a hostage.

1612
01:14:47,664 --> 01:14:49,063
如果你不他媽的閉嘴
You're gonna be a dead hostage

1613
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:50,259
你就將變成死人質
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1614
01:14:51,769 --> 01:14:53,430
看這裡  宅男
Now look here, Red.

1615
01:14:53,504 --> 01:14:55,062
總的來說  我欣賞你
I like you, almost.

1616
01:14:55,139 --> 01:14:58,040
打電話給除了老媽以外的人  就是找死
You call anybody outside your mama, kapow.

1617
01:14:58,108 --> 01:14:59,598
明白嗎
Okay?

1618
01:15:00,444 --> 01:15:01,775
咱們走吧
Let's get out of here.

1619
01:15:04,281 --> 01:15:05,646
有人跟蹤嗎  夥計
Anybody following us, man?

1620
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:06,774
目前沒有
Not yet.

1621
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:09,284
不過我打賭馬上會有
But you can bet your ass they will be.

1622
01:15:09,353 --> 01:15:10,547
路  我們得棄車逃跑  夥計
Lou, we gotta dump the Mothership, man.

1623
01:15:10,621 --> 01:15:11,781
我們得棄車
We gotta dump it.

1624
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:13,322
你能丟下你的愛車
You'd abandon the Mothership?

1625
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,755
從法律上來說我們是逃犯
We're fugitives from the law.

1626
01:15:14,825 --> 01:15:16,759
我們的按逃犯的思路考慮問題
We gotta start thinking like it.

1627
01:15:16,827 --> 01:15:19,125
逃犯不是我們
We're not fugitives, O.J.

1628
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:21,460
而是你  我是人質
You're a fugitive. I'm a hostage.

1629
01:15:21,532 --> 01:15:23,329
這是我的說辭  而且我會堅持
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

1630
01:15:28,172 --> 01:15:29,230
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

1631
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:30,830
看  看  看
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1632

看那邊  夥計

1633

那不是萊斯特的車嗎
Ain't that Lester's car?

1634
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:37,279
混蛋
Motherfuckers.

1635
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:43,526
我們餓了  夥計
We're hungry, man.

1636
01:15:43,527 --> 01:15:45,307
來點烤雞什麼的
Come up with some baked chicken or something.

1637
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:52,962
他們又開始了
They're at it again.

1638
01:15:57,201 --> 01:15:59,692
該死的  萊斯特的車
Oh, shit! Lester's car!

1639
01:16:09,746 --> 01:16:11,646
- 聽見了嗎  - 什麼

01:16:15,018 --> 01:16:19,182
哦  我的天啊  天啊  不
Oh, my God! Oh, God, no! Oh, God...

1642
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:22,551
海因茲先生  亨德森先生
Mr. Hinds. Mr. Henderson.

1643
01:16:22,626 --> 01:16:23,786
看見你們太好了
It's so good to see you.

1644
01:16:23,861 --> 01:16:25,328
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1645
01:16:25,395 --> 01:16:28,831
你都不知道  裡面有多熱
Oh, it was so hot in there. You have no idea.

1646
01:16:28,899 --> 01:16:30,890
如果有什麼我能幫忙
If there's anything I can get you,

1647
01:16:30,968 --> 01:16:33,027
比如來杯拿鐵咖啡  我就是為你們服務的
like a latte, I'm here for you guys.

1648
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:34,434
但是我得先去方便一下
But first I really have to pee,

1649
01:16:34,505 --> 01:16:35,870
所以我得先跳出去
so I'm just gonna hop on out.

1650
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,839
請你能拉我一把
If you could give me a hand out of here.

1651
01:16:37,908 --> 01:16:39,068
我被關在這兒
I've been locked in there,

1652
01:16:39,142 --> 01:16:40,939
他們還整天開著低音喇叭
and they've had the woofers going all day.

1653
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:42,569
天啊
Oh, my God.

1654
01:16:42,646 --> 01:16:45,012
我得去撒尿  如果你不介意
I just have to pee real bad, so if you don't mind.

1655
01:16:45,082 --> 01:16:46,140
看見你們太好了
It's so good to see you.

1656
01:16:46,216 --> 01:16:48,047
海因茲先生

1657
01:17:00,564 --> 01:17:01,792

1663
01:17:10,507 --> 01:17:11,496
十分妥當

遺體放在一個鋼琴形狀的棺材裡

1675
01:17:30,027 --> 01:17:31,756

-沒有搞錯吧  -在聽嗎
- Are you kidding me? - Hello?

1683
01:17:44,641 --> 01:17:45,869
該死的你在哪
Where the hell are you?

1684
01:17:45,943 --> 01:17:47,740
聽著  我打電話來是要告訴你
Listen, I called because I just wanted to let you know

1685
01:17:47,811 --> 01:17:50,279
一切都很好  都在我們掌控中
that everything's cool, and we're still on target.

1686
01:17:50,347 --> 01:17:51,575
我們
We?

1687
01:17:51,648 --> 01:17:53,309
你跟亨德森和海因茲在一起嗎
You're with Henderson and Hinds?

1688
01:17:53,383 --> 01:17:54,407
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

1689
01:17:54,484 --> 01:17:55,974
雖然他們總是說"混蛋"
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

1690
01:17:56,053 --> 01:17:57,315
但他們都是好人
but they're really good guys.

1691
01:17:57,387 --> 01:17:58,877
好吧  很好
All right, well, good.

1692
01:17:58,956 --> 01:18:00,287
你告訴他們
You can give them this message.

1693
01:18:00,357 --> 01:18:02,086
電視網那邊剛打電話來  他們不能出席演出
The network just called, and they're off the show.

1694
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,786
他們不能這麼做
But they can't do that!

1695
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,589
哦  是嗎  那可是VH1頻道
Oh, really? It's VH1.

1696
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:07,095
你看過愛的滋味嗎
Have you seen Flava of Love?

1697
01:18:07,164 --> 01:18:09,064
他們可以為所欲為
They can pretty much do whatever they want.

1698
01:18:09,132 --> 01:18:11,327
還有  你被開除了
And another thing, you're fired.

1699
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:14,427
混蛋  去死吧
Motherfucker! What the fuck?

1700
01:18:23,113 --> 01:18:23,943
他怎麼說
What'd he say?

1701
01:18:25,382 --> 01:18:28,112
他說我被開除了
Uh, he said I'm fired,

1702
01:18:28,185 --> 01:18:32,645
還有  還有  你們不能出席活動
and... and, uh, and you're off the show.

1703
01:18:39,663 --> 01:18:41,392
你  你說真的  夥計
Are... Are you serious, man?

1704
01:18:42,733 --> 01:18:44,325
對不起
I'm so sorry.

1705
01:19:28,612 --> 01:19:31,240
根據地圖來看
You know, uh, according to the map,

1706
01:19:31,314 --> 01:19:34,511
那條路通向高速公路
that road leads to the turnpike.

1707
01:19:34,584 --> 01:19:36,211
我們仍有時間完成
I think we've still got time to make it.

1708
01:19:36,286 --> 01:19:38,846
完成什麼  路易斯
Make what, Louis?

1709
01:19:38,922 --> 01:19:40,787
你聽見那個混蛋怎麼說的
You heard what the motherfucker said!

1710
01:19:40,857 --> 01:19:41,915
都結束了
It's over!

1711
01:19:41,992 --> 01:19:43,425
去他媽的
Fuck that.

1712
01:19:47,564 --> 01:19:51,864
我們說結束才是真的結束了  明白嗎
This shit ain't over till we say it's over, all right?

1713
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:55,536
一切都不同了
Things have changed,

1714
01:19:55,605 --> 01:19:59,666
我精神上有了新的領悟
and I have achieved a state of mental clarity.

1715
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,971
說的太好了
Ain't that a bitch?

1716
01:20:01,044 --> 01:20:02,272
你聽見那個混蛋的話了嗎
You hear what this motherfucker said?

1717
01:20:02,345 --> 01:20:05,143
夥計  從我敲你家門開始
Ever since I knocked on your door, man,

1718
01:20:05,215 --> 01:20:07,410
你就一直反對我
you've been beating my balls at every fucking turn.

1719
01:20:07,484 --> 01:20:11,147
現在突然間有領悟了
Now all of a sudden, you've got a state of clarity.

1720
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:12,950
你的領悟從洛杉磯來的  路
Where was your clarity in L.A., Lou?

1721
01:20:13,023 --> 01:20:14,513
你不能只像訂匹薩一樣
You can't just dial that shit up

1722
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:16,855
打個電話  混蛋
like you calling for a pizza, motherfucker.

1723
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:19,760
一定要深入  干實事
You got to go inside, do the work.

1724
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:22,424
因此  我承認
Consequently, I have a confession.

1725
01:20:23,867 --> 01:20:28,201
弗洛伊德  你是對的
Floyd, you were right about me.

1726
01:20:28,271 --> 01:20:32,264
我放棄了生命中很多事情
I have given up on a lot of things in my life.

1727
01:20:32,342 --> 01:20:34,810
但這次我不想放棄  行嗎
But I ain't giving up on this. All right?

1728
01:20:34,878 --> 01:20:38,678
來吧  夥計  我們過去幾天經歷了那麼多爛事
Come on, man, we've been through enough shit the last few days.

1729
01:20:38,749 --> 01:20:40,148
我們這次也可以挺過去
We can do this.

1730
01:20:40,217 --> 01:20:42,947
沒人敢阻止我們
And I dare anybody to try to stop us.

1731
01:20:43,019 --> 01:20:44,987
出發  混蛋
Let's go, motherfucker.

1732
01:20:45,055 --> 01:20:46,181
槍
Shotgun.

1733
01:20:47,524 --> 01:20:49,048
坐後面去
Get your ass in the backseat.

1734
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:52,125
無法再阻止我們
Ain't no stoppin' us now

1735
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,992
我們踏上征程
We're on the move

1736
01:20:57,801 --> 01:21:01,237
曾有許多事讓我們停滯
There's been so many things that's held us down

1737
01:21:01,304 --> 01:21:03,135
但是現在看來
But now it looks

1738
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:06,039
一切都能克服
Like things are finally coming around

1739
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:11,346
千萬別失望  失望
Don't you let nothing, nothing

1740
01:21:11,414 --> 01:21:15,407
堅定不移
Stand in your way

1741
01:21:15,485 --> 01:21:19,285
我要你傾聽  傾聽
I want y'all to listen, listen

1742
01:21:19,356 --> 01:21:22,883
我說的每個字  每個字
To every word I say, every word I say

1743
01:21:22,959 --> 01:21:25,427
無法再阻止我們
Ain't no stopping us now

1744
01:21:25,495 --> 01:21:26,860
沒有  沒有
No, no, no

1745
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,397
我們踏上征程
We're on the move

1746
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:31,730
路途奇妙
The movin' groovin'

1747
01:21:31,802 --> 01:21:34,168
無法再阻止我們
Ain't no stopping us now

1748
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:36,171
音效和地板放射性監測器都打開  懂嗎
Full sound and switch on all the floor monitors, all right?

1749
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,400
看那個  那個很管用很敏感
Look at that. That's nice and subtle.

1750
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:39,601
我馬上做  音效測試
I'm on it, then. Sound check.

1751
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:40,643
好的  謝謝
Okay. Thanks.

1752
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:41,642
- 愛普斯坦先生  - 什麼事?
- Mr. Epstein. - Yeah?

1753
01:21:41,711 --> 01:21:43,008
你在這太好了
Hey, thank God you're here.

1754
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:44,239
天  這怎麼可能
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

1755
01:21:44,314 --> 01:21:46,145
你在這幹什麼  我已經開除你了
What are you doing here? I thought I fired you.

1756
01:21:46,216 --> 01:21:48,377
我只想告訴你  我不是自己來的
I just wanted to tell you I'm not alone.

1757
01:21:54,624 --> 01:21:55,989
你們都瘋了
You guys are insane!

1758
01:21:56,059 --> 01:21:57,686
很高興見到你  小愛普
Good to see you, too, Little Ep.

1759
01:21:57,761 --> 01:21:59,854
這根本行不通
Yeah, this is never going to happen.

1760
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:02,626
你們一旦被認出就會被逮捕
You'll be arrested the moment the cops spot you.

1761
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,496
我們不關心那些
We don't care anything about that.

1762
01:22:04,568 --> 01:22:06,502
我們只想唱自己的歌
We just want to do our song.

1763
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:08,800
還有一件事  你有時間嗎
Oh, one other thing. You got a few minutes?

1764
01:22:08,872 --> 01:22:10,339
有  我佔用了全世界的時間
Yeah, I got all the time in the world.

1765
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:12,034
我正在錄製一個電視秀
I'm just producing a television show

1766
01:22:12,108 --> 01:22:13,735
有很多音樂明星參與
with dozens of huge musical acts

1767
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:15,937
還有17分半鐘就開始直播了
that goes live in 171/2 minutes,

1768
01:22:16,012 --> 01:22:17,946
但是你知道  拿些咖啡來  我們談談
but you know, let's grab some coffee and have a little chit-chat.

1769
01:22:23,687 --> 01:22:26,053
他得這病多長時間了
Wow. How long's he got?

1770
01:22:27,924 --> 01:22:29,016
不知道
We don't know.

1771
01:22:31,061 --> 01:22:32,050
好吧
All right.

1772
01:22:32,128 --> 01:22:34,187
我會盡力的  好吧
I'll see what I can do. Okay?

1773
01:22:34,264 --> 01:22:35,856
謝謝

1778
01:22:58,188 --> 01:22:59,655
黑人摩西
The Black Moses.

01:23:09,099 --> 01:23:11,294
聽說你們來了  祝你們好運
Heard you were here. Just wanted to wish you luck.

1787
01:23:12,435 --> 01:23:13,424
順便說一下
Oh, by the way,

1788
01:23:13,503 --> 01:23:15,095
我帶了個人見你
brought somebody by to see you.

1789
01:23:15,171 --> 01:23:16,229
是嗎
Oh, is that right?

1790
01:23:16,306 --> 01:23:17,603
是的
Yeah.

1791
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:26,906
好了  我們都出去吧
Okay, everybody, let's move on out of here.

1792
01:23:26,983 --> 01:23:28,211
快點
Come on.

1793
01:23:28,285 --> 01:23:30,150
好了  大家都聽見亨德森先生的話了
All right, you heard what Mr. Henderson said.

1794
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,152
你先走  小夥子
After you, young man.

1795
01:23:31,221 --> 01:23:32,950
好的
Okay.

1796
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:55,602
對不起我選擇了逃避
I'm sorry I ran out the way I did.

1797
01:23:56,813 --> 01:23:59,145
我才是逃避的人
I'm the one who ran out.

1798
01:23:59,215 --> 01:24:01,342
你不需要道歉
There's no need for you to apologize.

1799
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:09,087
能幫你打領帶嗎
Can I help you with your tie?

1800
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:10,456
當然可以
Yeah, sure.

1801
01:24:10,527 --> 01:24:12,552
你知道自己在做什麼嗎
You know what you're doing?

1802
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:14,460
是的  我當然知道
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1803
01:24:15,999 --> 01:24:17,626
好了
Here you go.

1804
01:24:23,206 --> 01:24:24,434
你沒事吧
You all right?

1805
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:26,304
沒事  幫我拿點水
Yeah. Just some water, please.

1806
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:27,343
該死
Damn!

1807
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,707
相機都準備好了
All cameras are on point.

1808
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:29,972
剛加了兩個麥克風
We just added two mics.

1809
01:24:30,046 --> 01:24:31,707
愛普斯坦先生  快過來一下
Mr. Epstein! You better come quick.

1810
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:32,577
快點  我是認真的
Come on, I'm serious.

1811
01:24:32,577 --> 01:24:33,373
快點  情況緊急
Come on! It's important!

1812
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,610
好的  幫我照看一下這裡
All right. Take care of those.

1813
01:24:34,684 --> 01:24:35,708
只有15分鐘了  丹尼
15 minutes, Danny.

1814
01:24:38,555 --> 01:24:39,647
他突然就病發了
He just collapsed.

1815
01:24:39,723 --> 01:24:41,452
我覺得他肯定很痛
I think he's in a lot of pain.

1816
01:24:41,524 --> 01:24:42,991
張開手  張開手
Open your hand.Open your hand.

1817
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:44,117
在這裡  在這裡
Right there, right there.

1818
01:24:44,194 --> 01:24:46,560
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

1819
01:24:47,731 --> 01:24:50,063
堅強點  老兄  堅持住
Be strong, brother.Hang on in there.

1820
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:51,998
現在不是去醫院檢查的時候
It ain't time for you to check out now.

1821
01:24:52,068 --> 01:24:53,330
檢查  幹嘛
Check out? What?

1822
01:24:53,403 --> 01:24:54,569
行了  夥計
Come on, man.

1823
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:55,735
大家都知道是怎麼回事
Everybody knows, man.

1824
01:24:55,805 --> 01:24:58,137
我阿姨也在用這種該死的藥  夥計
My aunt was taking the same doggone pills, man.

1825
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:00,870
她一個星期  疼得又踢又叫
Took her about a week before she wasted away to nothing,

1826
01:25:00,944 --> 01:25:02,138
然後就越來越瘦弱直到死去
just kicking and screaming.

1827
01:25:02,212 --> 01:25:03,577
我不知道她得什麼病死的
I don't know what killed her ass,

1828
01:25:03,646 --> 01:25:06,945
但如果她是吃了這種藥  那她就有膀胱炎
but if she was taking those,she had a bladder infection.

1829
01:25:07,017 --> 01:25:08,143
你說什麼
Say what?

1830
01:25:08,218 --> 01:25:11,381
蒙古大夫  我有腎結石
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,I got a kidney stone.

1831
01:25:11,454 --> 01:25:12,944
雖然在尿尿的時候確實他媽的痛
Hurts like a motherfucker when I pee,

1832
01:25:13,023 --> 01:25:14,285
但還不至於要了我的命
but it ain't gonna kill me.

1833
01:25:14,357 --> 01:25:15,551
這麼說你不是要死啦
So you're not dying?

1834
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:18,992
自從我們呱呱墜地  都注定了會有死的那天
From the first slap and cry,we all start to die.

1835
01:25:19,062 --> 01:25:21,724
但我不會死得那麼早  絕對不會
But I ain't on no accelerated program,hell, no.

1836
01:25:21,798 --> 01:25:23,993
真是天大的笑話
Ain't that about a bitch?

1837
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:26,934
我做了這一切  把你從監獄裡劫出來
All that damn hard work,busting your ass out of jail,

1838
01:25:27,003 --> 01:25:28,163
但你卻還死不了
and you ain't even dying.

1839
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:29,603
我多希望能看你到死的那一刻
I was kinda looking forward to seeing you go.

1840
01:25:29,672 --> 01:25:31,867
打擾一下  丹尼  他們兩分鐘後上台
Excuse me, Danny.They're on in two.

1841
01:25:31,941 --> 01:25:33,533
好的  大家都準備好了嗎  夥計們
All right. Where we at, guys?

1842
01:25:34,744 --> 01:25:36,439
好了  我沒事
Okay, I'm good.

1843
01:25:39,849 --> 01:25:41,908
猶如麥加聖地一般的阿波羅劇場
The Apollo, the mecca.

1844
01:25:41,985 --> 01:25:43,384
喚起了無數的美好回憶  夥計
This brings back memories, man.

1845
01:25:43,453 --> 01:25:45,080
我們已經在這表演過多少次了
How many times you think we've performed here?

1846
01:25:46,423 --> 01:25:47,720
條子
ooh, five-oh.

1847
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:48,758
50場  真的嗎
50, really?

1848
01:25:48,825 --> 01:25:50,190
有條子
Five-oh.

1849
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,420
快點  跑  跑
Come on. Move, move.

1850
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:53,257
是他們  站住  站住
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

1851
01:25:53,329 --> 01:25:55,593
所有單位注意  所有單位注意
All units report, all units report.

1852
01:25:55,665 --> 01:25:57,064
發現嫌疑犯
Suspects have been spotted.

1853
01:25:57,133 --> 01:26:00,102
所有單位  秘密拘捕他們  但記住按規章辦事
All units, apprehend them quietly and by the book.

1854
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:03,439
路  你認為他們走了嗎  夥計
Hey, Lou, do you think they're gone, man?

1855
01:26:03,506 --> 01:26:05,030
我又不能透視  蠢貨
I don't have X-ray vision, motherfucker!

1856
01:26:05,108 --> 01:26:06,132
我怎麼會知道
How would I know?

1857
01:26:06,209 --> 01:26:08,439
聲音小點  路  該死
Lower your voice, Lou.Doggone it, man.

1858
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:10,342
這裡太黑了  根本什麼都看不到
It's so dark in here you can't see shit.

1859
01:26:10,413 --> 01:26:11,641
等等
Hold up.

1860
01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:13,147
我看看能不能找到打火機
Let me see if I can reach my lighter.

1861
01:26:13,216 --> 01:26:14,342
別在這點打火機  夥計
Don't light no lighter up in here, man.

1862
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:15,907
你想讓我們變成烤肉嗎
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

1863
01:26:15,985 --> 01:26:17,577
等一下
Hold on one minute.

1864
01:26:17,654 --> 01:26:19,349
該死的
Shit.

1865
01:26:23,093 --> 01:26:26,119
是他媽的馬庫斯·胡克斯
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

1866
01:26:26,196 --> 01:26:28,596
這裡離林伍德大街挺遠的吧  混蛋
Long way from Linwood Street, huh,motherfucker?

1867
01:26:28,665 --> 01:26:30,997
去他媽的林伍德大街  還有他
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

1868
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:32,600
他利用了我們兩個  這你是知道的
He used both of us, and you know it.

1869
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:33,601
別這樣  老兄
Come on, man.

1870
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:35,600
他只不過覺得自己是腕兒了就單飛了而已
He just thought he'd be a bigger star going solo.

1871
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:36,601
他做得很對
He was right.

1872
01:26:36,601 --> 01:26:37,601
對個屁
No he wasn't.

1873
01:26:37,601 --> 01:26:39,601
他只不過不想把錢分成三份罷了
He didn't want to split the money three ways.

1874
01:26:39,876 --> 01:26:41,002
看看他那衰樣  傻呆呆地坐著
Just look at him, sitting there

1875
01:26:41,077 --> 01:26:43,136
臉上還掛著老年痴呆般的笑容
with that old shit-eating grin on his face.

1876
01:26:43,213 --> 01:26:45,704
你覺得自己很行  是不是  混蛋
You think you're all that, motherfucker, don't you?

1877
01:26:45,782 --> 01:26:47,613
我必須承認  每次只要一想到你
I have to admit, every time I think about you,

1878
01:26:47,684 --> 01:26:49,948
我就恨不得想把你掐死
I could just choke the shit out of you!

1879
01:26:50,019 --> 01:26:51,145
住手  住手
Stop it, stop it!

1880
01:26:51,221 --> 01:26:53,052
弗洛伊德  他沒想法  他是死人
Floyd, he ain't thinking shit. He's dead.

1881
01:26:55,692 --> 01:26:58,752
看啊  這不是我的表嗎
Say, ain't that my watch?

1882
01:26:58,828 --> 01:27:00,819
看看  你認為是我偷了那該死的
See? You thought I stole that mother...

1883
01:27:00,897 --> 01:27:02,922
我告訴過你這混蛋是一個盜竊狂
I told you this motherfucker was a klepto!

1884
01:27:02,999 --> 01:27:04,364
該死  看看那個
Shit, look at that.

1885
01:27:04,434 --> 01:27:05,799
真漂亮
That's nice.

1886
01:27:05,869 --> 01:27:06,961
也許這個也是偷的
Probably stole that, too.

1887
01:27:07,036 --> 01:27:09,300
這混蛋的品位向來不錯
Motherfucker always had good taste, though.

1888
01:27:09,372 --> 01:27:10,703
這個我留下了
I'm gonna keep this.

1889
01:27:15,345 --> 01:27:17,176
路易斯
Hey, Louis.

1890
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:19,442
你覺得如果
You think if, you know...

1891
01:27:19,516 --> 01:27:21,484
如果他沒有  沒有死的話
if he wouldn't have, you know, died,

1892
01:27:21,551 --> 01:27:22,848
你覺得我們會再重組嗎
you think we would have got back together?

1893
01:27:22,919 --> 01:27:24,511
不  當然不
Oh, hell, no.

1894
01:27:24,587 --> 01:27:26,418
但是你知道嗎
But you know what?

1895
01:27:26,489 --> 01:27:27,547
我們現在在一起
We are together,

1896
01:27:27,624 --> 01:27:29,683
我一直在考慮我們的分配問題
and I've been thinking about our little arrangement.

1897
01:27:29,759 --> 01:27:33,955
我們把酬金五五分  怎麼樣
I'm gonna go ahead and break you off 50/50, all right?

1898
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:35,622
路  你實在是
Wow, Lou, that's...

1899
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:38,360
你實在是太夠意思了  夥計
that's real black of you, man.

1900
01:27:38,434 --> 01:27:40,061
但是我們其實沒有酬金
Because there ain't no money.

1901
01:27:40,136 --> 01:27:41,160
你說什麼
Say what?

1902
01:27:41,237 --> 01:27:43,205
是你自己說的
Well, you said it yourself.

1903
01:27:43,273 --> 01:27:44,262
這是個葬禮
It's a funeral.

1904
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,500
沒人會花錢請你唱歌  夥計
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

1905
01:27:45,575 --> 01:27:46,974
那個酬金是你編出來的
You lied about the money?

1906
01:27:47,043 --> 01:27:48,977
-是的  -你這個混蛋
- Yeah.- You motherfucker.

1907
01:27:49,045 --> 01:27:50,910
但你不能說來這一趟並不值得啊
Hey, you can't say it wasn't worth it.

1908
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,845
我是想說不值得
Well, I could say it.

1909
01:27:54,717 --> 01:27:56,514
但那是撒謊
But I'd be lying.

1910
01:27:56,586 --> 01:27:58,247
我愛你  路
I love you, Lou.

1911
01:27:58,321 --> 01:28:00,414
好兄弟
My nigger.

1912
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:02,515
但對於這個混蛋  我忍不住
But this motherfucker,you know, I can't help it.

1913
01:28:02,592 --> 01:28:04,685
每一次  我都忍不住想要殺了這個混蛋
Every time,I could just kill this motherfucker!

1914
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:06,729
他離開的原因就是你總是挑剔他
That's why he left, because you was always picking on him.

1915
01:28:06,796 --> 01:28:07,854
別跟他較勁了
Stop fucking with him.

1916
01:28:07,931 --> 01:28:09,831
他毀了我的幸福
He fucked with my happiness.

1917
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:20,470
女士們  先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

1918
01:28:20,543 --> 01:28:23,011
我是艾薩克·赫斯
I'm Isaac Hayes.

1919
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:26,838
他們死到哪兒去了  丹尼
Where the fuck are they, Danny?

1920
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:29,942
我親愛的朋友們  請跟我一起
My good friends, please join me

1921
01:28:30,019 --> 01:28:33,785
向我們的兄弟馬庫斯·胡克斯告別
in saying farewell to brother Marcus Hooks.

1922
01:28:39,796 --> 01:28:41,161
是路易斯和弗洛伊德
It's Louis and Floyd!

1923
01:28:41,231 --> 01:28:42,357
是正拳組合
It's the Real Deal!

1924
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:48,299
馬庫斯·胡克斯和正拳組合
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal,

1925
01:28:48,371 --> 01:28:50,100
再度聚首
back together again.

1926
01:28:50,173 --> 01:28:53,102
請為他們鼓掌吧
Give them a hand.

1927
01:28:53,176 --> 01:28:56,077
為了團聚
Reunited, y'all.

1928
01:28:56,145 --> 01:28:57,544
他們將再次合作
They got their shit together.

1929
01:28:57,614 --> 01:29:00,447
是的  讓我們拭目以待吧
Yes! Let's go!

1930
01:29:00,516 --> 01:29:02,347
各就各位  聽我的命令行事
Stand by.Move in on my command.

1931
01:29:02,418 --> 01:29:03,885
請等等  等等  等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1932
01:29:03,953 --> 01:29:05,614
拜託了  各位警官和探長
Come on, Officer detective person.

1933
01:29:05,688 --> 01:29:06,950
求你們  別這樣
Please, just, you know, come on.

1934
01:29:07,023 --> 01:29:08,888
允許他們唱一首歌  只要一首
Let them sing one song.One little song.

1935
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:10,619
不會出什麼亂子的
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

1936
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:12,320
正拳組合
The Real Deal!

1937
01:29:14,597 --> 01:29:17,657
好吧  就一首歌
All right. One song.

1938
01:29:17,734 --> 01:29:19,634
但最好是好歌
But it better be good.

1939
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:23,662
一首歌  一首好歌
One song. The good one.

1940
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:29,404
胯骨感覺怎麼樣
How's that hip?

1941
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:30,571
完全準備好了  寶貝
Locked and loaded, baby.

1942
01:29:30,647 --> 01:29:31,909
開始吧
Let's do this.

1943
01:29:33,349 --> 01:29:35,044
樂隊
Band!

1944
01:29:35,118 --> 01:29:37,109
我們來一首《公園漫步》
Let's take a walk in the park.

1945
01:29:37,186 --> 01:29:39,484
1  2  3  4
1,2,3,4!

1946
01:29:53,269 --> 01:29:55,635
當河水開始流淌
When the river gets to rollin'

1947
01:29:55,705 --> 01:29:59,334
你為其注入滿滿靈魂
And then you add a bowlful of soul in

1948
01:29:59,409 --> 01:30:02,674
我試著讓它盡情奔放
And then I tried to let it all go then

1949
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,607
哦  對我來說很簡單
Oh, it's easy to me

1950
01:30:06,683 --> 01:30:10,050
看看  我如何駕馭節拍
You see, the way I ride the rhythm

1951
01:30:10,119 --> 01:30:13,680
看看  我如何只講實話
You see, the truth is all I can give 'em

1952
01:30:13,756 --> 01:30:16,452
而歌詞就是取自生活
And the lyrics can come from livin'

1953
01:30:16,526 --> 01:30:20,223
哦  耶  哦  對我來說很簡單
Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me

1954
01:30:22,065 --> 01:30:26,024
音樂就來自我的內心
Music comes out of my heart

1955
01:30:26,102 --> 01:30:30,061
就像漫步在公園
Something like a walking the park

1956
01:30:30,139 --> 01:30:33,199
就像漫步在公園一樣
It's just a walk in the park

1957
01:30:35,144 --> 01:30:37,874
我沒聽見  其他人在公園
And no one else in here, I heard it

1958
01:30:37,947 --> 01:30:41,576
我不知道  是否得償所願
I don't know what I've done to deserve it

1959
01:30:41,651 --> 01:30:45,246
全心投入沒有疑惑
You don't question it while you serve it

1960
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,647
這是天賜機緣
Oh, it was given to me

1961
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:52,252
賦予我你的激情
I got something you inherit

1962
01:30:52,328 --> 01:30:55,354
我不知道你是否為分享它而生
I don't know that you was born to share it

1963
01:30:55,431 --> 01:30:59,367
但是  若想成功  沒它不行
And if you shoot,be sure you wear it

1964
01:31:01,437 --> 01:31:02,768
哦  這是我的本性流露
Oh, it comes naturally to me

1965
01:31:05,141 --> 01:31:07,234
音樂就來自我的內心
Music comes out of my heart

1966
01:31:08,845 --> 01:31:12,440
就像漫步在公園
Something like a walk in the park

1967
01:31:12,515 --> 01:31:14,506
就像漫步在公園一樣
It's just a walk in the park

1968
01:31:20,323 --> 01:31:22,382
今也你們是否開心
Y'all having a good time out here tonight?

1969
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:24,483
我就是想讓你開心
This is what I'm talking about!

1970
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,721
你可知公園漫步  夥計
You know about that walk in the park, man?

1971
01:31:26,796 --> 01:31:28,286
我當然知道公園漫步
Sure I know about that walk in the park.

1972
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:29,854
-真的  -讓你瞧瞧
-You do? -I'll tell you what.

1973
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:31,695
-讓他們看看 -開始
- Show them. - Got to get down.

1974
01:31:39,509 --> 01:31:40,703
女士們  先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

1975
01:31:40,777 --> 01:31:42,768
請在阿波羅劇院的舞台上
let's give a big Apollo welcome

1976
01:31:42,845 --> 01:31:44,745
熱烈歡迎首次在這裡表演的
to the stage for the first time,

1977
01:31:44,814 --> 01:31:48,944
我的女兒  克里奧·惠特菲爾德小姐
my daughter, Miss Cleo Whitfield!

1978
01:31:49,018 --> 01:31:52,613
全力開創一片天地
To make something out of nothin'

1979
01:31:52,688 --> 01:31:56,124
這是我們共同志願
That's what we all got in common

1980
01:31:56,192 --> 01:31:59,719
只需緊緊相擁  我就到來
So just hold on tight, I'm comin'

1981
01:32:01,798 --> 01:32:03,231
告訴我
Said to me

1982
01:32:03,299 --> 01:32:06,462
我就給你可堅持的信仰
I'll give you something you can believe in

1983
01:32:06,536 --> 01:32:10,302
今夜我們全身心投入
And then enjoy yourself this evenin'

1984
01:32:10,373 --> 01:32:13,604
你肯定不能抽身而去
And don't you dare think about leavin'

1985
01:32:15,545 --> 01:32:19,379
跟我一起唱
Sing along with me

1986
01:32:19,449 --> 01:32:22,976
音樂就來自我內心
Music comes out of my heart

1987
01:32:23,052 --> 01:32:25,452
就像漫步在公園
Something like a walk in the park

1988
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:28,781
就像漫步在公園一樣
It's just a walk in the park

1989
01:32:33,629 --> 01:32:36,462
音樂就來自我內心
Music comes out of my heart

1990
01:32:36,532 --> 01:32:40,901
就像漫步在公園
Something like a walk in the park

1991
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:43,768
就像漫步在公園一樣
It's just a walk in the park

1992
01:32:47,877 --> 01:32:50,573
音樂就來自我內心
Music comes out of my heart

1993
01:32:50,646 --> 01:32:52,100
就一首歌
One song.

1994
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,241
因在獄中表現良好獲得減刑
正拳組合終於正式重返舞台

1995
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:00,600
並且加入一名新主唱

1996
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:03,615
音樂就來自我內心
Music comes out of my heart

1997
01:33:03,693 --> 01:33:05,752
我是他們的經紀人
I'm their manager!

1998
01:33:05,828 --> 01:33:07,921
就像漫步在公園
Something like a walk in the park

1999
01:33:07,997 --> 01:33:09,760
漫步在公園
Walk in the park

2000
01:33:09,832 --> 01:33:11,026
就像漫步在公園一樣
It's just a walk in the park

2001
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:17,164
就像漫步在公園一樣
Just like a walk in the park

2002
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:15,625
你今晚會唱得很棒
You're gonna sing real nice tonight.

2003
01:34:18,868 --> 01:34:21,564
快樂時光要來臨
Got that funky time

2004
01:34:21,637 --> 01:34:30,242
我能感受到
I can feel it

2005
01:34:31,881 --> 01:34:34,247
每當攝像機或者麥克風開啟之後
Any time the camera or the mic comes on,

2006
01:34:34,317 --> 01:34:35,750
我不會糊弄自己
I don't cheat myself.

2007
01:34:35,818 --> 01:34:38,218
這是我在孩提時候學到的第一條原則
That was rule number 1 I was taught as a kid.

2008
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:40,084
當然我肯定也不能糊弄觀眾
And I definitely can't cheat the audience.

2009
01:34:40,156 --> 01:34:41,953
因此每一次做事
So I give 150%

2010
01:34:42,024 --> 01:34:45,118
我都會付出150%的努力
every single time that I do anything.

2011
01:34:45,194 --> 01:34:46,957
我的生活中也是這樣
Even the way I live my life.

2012
01:34:47,029 --> 01:34:49,896
我會珍惜每一次糟糕的經歷
I just cherish each doggone moment.

2013
01:34:49,966 --> 01:34:52,491
再說個黑人牧師的笑話吧  怎麼樣
A black preacher's something else, ain't it?

2014
01:34:52,568 --> 01:34:55,594
你去了教堂以後付不起房租
You can't pay your rent after you come from church.

2015
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,574
如果你向牧師要5塊錢
And if you ask the preacher for the $5.00,

2016
01:34:59,642 --> 01:35:02,634
他這樣告訴你  "以神的名義操你媽"
he'll be like, "Fuck you in the name of Jesus. "

2017
01:35:02,712 --> 01:35:05,476
我的喜劇不是臆想出來的
My comedy is not fictitious.

2018
01:35:05,548 --> 01:35:08,813
我的喜劇必須得來自我的內心
My comedy has to come from my heart.

2019
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,216
-查理·陳是個好漢  -好吧  來排練一下
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.- All right, let's rehearse.

2020
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,815
上完廁所  逛過中國還沒洗手
He went through China with his shit in his hand.

2021
01:35:16,892 --> 01:35:19,383
五個女人靠牆站
Had five women against the wall.

2022
01:35:19,462 --> 01:35:22,192
我敢打賭他把她們全部都干
I betcha five dollars that he fucked them all.

2023
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:23,561
他辛苦地干
He fucked them hard.

2024
01:35:23,633 --> 01:35:24,759
他長久地干
He fucked them long.

2025
01:35:24,834 --> 01:35:27,394
一直感到弟弟被抽乾
He fucked them till his shit got sore.

2026
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,938
他去看病  大夫回答
He went to the doctor,and the doctor said,

2027
01:35:30,006 --> 01:35:32,338
"對不起  查理  你的弟弟已經不應答"
"Sorry, Charlie, your dick is dead. "

2028
01:35:32,408 --> 01:35:35,241
他說  "大夫  大夫  不是真的阿"
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,that can't be true. "

2029
01:35:35,311 --> 01:35:37,939
"沒錯  先生  你的蛋蛋也沒氣啦"
"Yes, sir, Charlie,your balls are too!"

2030
01:35:39,782 --> 01:35:41,545
我的一生都在演出
I've been performing all my life.

2031
01:35:41,617 --> 01:35:43,278
因此  對我來說  在觀眾面前表演
So being in front of an audience

2032
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:44,979
從來都不是問題
has never been a problem for me.

2033
01:35:45,054 --> 01:35:46,885
該離開了
It's time to go?

2034
01:35:47,823 --> 01:35:49,188
那就走唄
Well, go on, then.

2035
01:35:52,094 --> 01:35:54,858
要給觀眾留下長久的印象
You want to leave a lasting impression on your audience.

2036
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:57,490
這也是我第一次開始表演時
You know, and that's something I was taught, too,

2037
01:35:57,566 --> 01:35:58,863
別人教給我的
when I first started.

2038
01:35:58,934 --> 01:36:00,162
儘量讓觀眾記住你
Always make them remember you,

2039
01:36:00,236 --> 01:36:03,034
或者記住關於你的電影的一些事
or remember something about you and the film.

2040
01:36:03,105 --> 01:36:06,734
我要回我600美金一晚上的酒店去了
I'm going back to my $600-a-night hotel room,

2041
01:36:06,809 --> 01:36:11,746
來一個  一個泡泡浴什麼的
have me a nice-ass, uh,piece of pussy and shit.

2042
01:36:11,814 --> 01:36:12,872
是嗎
Okay?

2043
01:36:12,948 --> 01:36:15,007
停
Cut it.

2044
01:36:16,786 --> 01:36:17,878
好的  深呼吸  深呼吸
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

2045
01:36:17,953 --> 01:36:19,978
我還沒進去呢
I'm not even in yet.

2046
01:36:20,056 --> 01:36:24,192
讓我來為你跳舞
I got to boogie for you

2047
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,524
我為你搖擺
I got nothin' but boogie

2048
01:36:26,595 --> 01:36:28,893
只想為你搖擺
Nothin' but boogie for you

2049
01:36:28,964 --> 01:36:30,864
我只想搖擺
I got nothin' but boogie

2050
01:36:30,933 --> 01:36:32,560
只想為你搖擺
Nothin' but boogie for you

2051
01:36:32,635 --> 01:36:40,174
搖擺  搖擺
Boogie, boogie

2052
01:36:43,345 --> 01:36:46,075
我想對你們所有人說聲謝謝
I want to say thanks to you all

2053
01:36:46,148 --> 01:36:49,879
因為你們成就了我
because you all made me... yeah.

2054
01:36:54,056 --> 01:36:56,854
沒有你們就沒有我的電視秀或者電影
I wouldn't have no TV show or movies.

2055
01:36:56,926 --> 01:36:58,791
你們是為了看我才來的
You all was coming to see me,

2056
01:36:58,861 --> 01:37:00,522
是你們成就了我
and you all made me...

2057
01:37:00,596 --> 01:37:03,531
在查塔努加  路易斯安那  密西西比
Chattanooga, Louisiana, Mississippi.

2058
01:37:04,734 --> 01:37:06,725
謝謝你們
So thank you.

2059
01:37:06,802 --> 01:37:09,362
我想如果我跟其他很多人一樣
I think if I had a few free passes

2060
01:37:09,438 --> 01:37:10,735
度過很多的空閒時間
like a lot of people,

2061
01:37:10,806 --> 01:37:13,297
我就不會像現在這樣成功
I don't think I would be as successful as I have.

2062
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:15,036
我經歷的最艱苦的事情
My task here on Earth

2063
01:37:15,111 --> 01:37:18,239
就是我必須得比常人更加地努力
is I have to work harder than the average bear.

2064
01:37:18,314 --> 01:37:20,321
這看起來很簡單  不是嗎
It look easy, don't it?

2065
01:37:21,016 --> 01:37:22,103
但實際上不是的
But it's not.

2066
01:37:22,184 --> 01:37:24,709
謝謝你  甜心  謝謝
Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you.

2067
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:29,751
此片贈與 伯尼·麥克和阿里扎·海耶斯

2068
01:37:31,322 --> 01:37:36,966
兩位真正的靈魂歌手
