1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:04,849
Marcus Hooks and the
Real Deal, take 6.

2
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:06,886
- That's three names.
- You want me to sing the main line?

3
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:09,513
Oh, yeah, here
we go, here we go.

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,023
<i>Tonight we take a
musical journey south,</i>

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:15,061
<i>where the legendary soul band
Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

6
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:17,062
<i>developed their
signature sound.</i>

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,529
1, 2!

8
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:25,598
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

9
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:29,403
<i>They started out singing for pennies
on the street corners of Memphis.</i>

10
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:32,110
Pull the string

11
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,670
And I'll wink at you

12
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:36,340
I'm your puppet

13
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:40,449
Mm-hmm, yeah

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,454
I'll do funny things

15
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,990
If you want me to

16
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,787
I'm your puppet

17
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:52,829
I'm yours

18
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,630
To have and to hold

19
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:58,261
Darling, you've got

20
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:00,169
Full control

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,003
Of your puppet

22
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,476
<i>But by 1972,</i>

23
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,034
<i>Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal</i>

24
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:09,344
<i>had become one of the
biggest R&B acts in the world.</i>

25
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,510
Nothin' like sweet soul music

26
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,520
To bring us together

27
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:17,182
<i>They played to sellout
houses all over the world.</i>

28
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:18,952
<i>They'd sold 6 million records</i>

29
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,687
<i>and influenced a generation
of American musicians.</i>

30
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:24,595
Dance to the sweet soul music

31
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:25,596
Yahh

32
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:28,634
<i>But that all ended
on July 24, 1977,</i>

33
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:30,670
<i>when Marcus Hooks
began his solo career</i>

34
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:33,706
<i>with a dramatic concert at New
York's Madison Square Garden.</i>

35
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:35,401
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:38,273
<i>Marcus Hooks.</i>

37
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:47,777
Marcus.

38
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:48,878
Ooh-ooh-ooh

39
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:51,150
Hey, boy, hi.

40
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:52,657
Hey, boy, dance.

41
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:53,818
Yeah.

42
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,885
<i>But while Hooks
became a music legend,</i>

43
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:58,692
<i>the journey took a
decidedly different direction</i>

44
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,461
<i>for former band mates Floyd
Henderson and Louis Hinds.</i>

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,331
<i>Renowned for their
signature dance stylings</i>

46
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:08,101
<i>from their one breakout
hit, "Walk in the Park,"</i>

47
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,666
<i>the duo broke up in 1979.</i>

48
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:12,234
<i>Citing creative differences</i>

49
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:15,179
<i>and a desire to pursue
separate projects.</i>

50
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,341
Back off! Freeze!

51
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,679
Get your hands up!
Let me see them!

52
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,879
Oh. Wait. Wait,
wait. It ain't... Ohh!

53
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:23,752
The gun ain't real!
Ow! It ain't real! Ow!

54
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,519
I'm just broke, God it!

55
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,116
I ain't tryin' to hurt no!

56
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:28,661
Watch your damn hands!

57
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,195
Police mother brutality!

58
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:31,628
<i>While Floyd Henderson...</i>

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,795
Come on down to
Floyd's Car Wash,

60
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:37,928
where everything
is done by hand.

61
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:39,767
<i>...combined his showmanship</i>

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,035
<i>with an entrepreneur spirit.</i>

63
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,235
And don't forget about
Super Soul Sundays,

64
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:46,404
with a full body wash

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,539
to guarantee a free rimjob.

66
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:53,277
Come on. Get your rimjob.

67
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:54,445
Come get your rimjob.

68
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,785
Come and get your rimjob!

69
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:59,883
<i>Whatever happened to
the forgotten duo...</i>

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,359
<i>The Real Deal?</i>

71
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:06,895
Baby, turn the navigation on.

72
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,629
I hope we can find this
place sometime tonight.

73
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,295
He gonna love it there.

74
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,396
They got Craftmatic
adjustable beds,

75
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,498
clap-on lamps.

76
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,406
Y'all better shut up back
there, I'm tellin' you.

77
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:18,671
I'm gonna reach back there

78
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:21,213
and pop one of them little
boys upside the head so bad.

79
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,444
I think that's
it, Uncle Floyd.

80
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,280
Whoo!

81
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:30,187
Now, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this bullshit.

82
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:33,249
What you talking about? It's
beautiful. You don't like this?

83
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:34,418
It's a death camp.

84
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,826
Oh, how is it a
death camp, Unc?

85
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:39,024
We got 36 holes of golf.

86
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,726
Three swimming pools.

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,700
You know the ratio
of women to men here

88
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,363
is 5 to 1, Unc? 5 to 1.

89
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,735
That mean you got
'em everywhere.

90
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,068
You can't even move.
There's women...

91
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,608
Every time you look around,

92
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,735
women crawling between
your legs, arms, anything.

93
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:54,644
I mean, damn, Unc. And if you're
worried about the business,

94
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:55,738
I got that.

95
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,544
You taught me
everything you know.

96
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,209
Yeah.

97
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,254
Yeah. You know something, son?

98
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,288
You're real crafty.

99
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,287
Appreciate that.

100
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:04,846
See, first you
move into my house.

101
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,620
Then you take
over my business.

102
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,217
- Aw, man, I ain't taking...
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,956
Then you move me all the
way out to the Valley, man,

104
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,554
so can't nobody hear
me scream. Right?

105
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,997
Actually, that's why
we're moving you here.

106
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,058
So the nurses can
hear your ass scream.

107
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,501
You remember you fell on
that floor for three days

108
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,539
- and couldn't nobody hear you.
- I remember.

109
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:23,940
Yeah. Now, stop being bitter,
man. Enjoy yourself, Unc.

110
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,774
There are your
golden years, player.

111
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,473
Now, come on in the
house and say bye

112
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,210
to Charlene and the kids.

113
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:33,742
Fuck them kids.

114
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,845
Fuck the kids?

115
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,014
Yeah.

116
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,049
Ohh...

117
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,197
- Ohhh... yeah, baby.
- Ohh! Ohh!

118
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:24,361
Ohh! Oh, give it to me.
Give it to me nice and hard.

119
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:26,871
<i>Oh, ¡papi, sil Ooh!</i>

120
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,100
Oh, right there!

121
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:29,835
Ohhhhh!

122
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,400
Uhh! Ohh!

123
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,106
Ooh. Don't stop, baby.

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,341
No.

125
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,849
No, you're not getting away.

126
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,179
Hoo hoo! Hoo hoo!

127
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,184
Yummy!

128
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,118
Uhh! Uhh! Yeah.

129
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:46,581
Aah!

130
00:05:58,104 --> 00:05:59,162
Mmm...

131
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:04,703
How's the hip?

132
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,903
Fine.

133
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,004
Okay.

134
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,217
Okay, Mr. Henderson.
I'm gonna need you

135
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,885
to, uh, stands up,
face the window,

136
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,655
and bend over the table.

137
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,526
My problem ain't back
in that area, doctor.

138
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:26,792
Look, Mr. Henderson,
your sleep problem

139
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,334
can be a symptom of a myriad
of different conditions,

140
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:30,630
some of which,
you know, are...

141
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,899
well, you know,
back in that area.

142
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,444
I don't like nobody
behind me like that, Huds.

143
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,274
I'm telling you, I just
don't like nobody playing

144
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,007
- with my penny.
- I'll be very gentle.

145
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,572
I'll be in and out
before you know it.

146
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,679
Just bend over. There you go.

147
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,383
Hold on, now. Get a good grip.

148
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,390
Ohh...

149
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,858
Just relax.

150
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:54,859
Relax.

151
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:55,986
Sittin' on

152
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:58,326
The dock of the bay

153
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,330
Watching the

154
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,425
Tiiiiiide

155
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:04,595
Roll away

156
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,899
Ooh ooh

157
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,066
All right, again,
Mr. Henderson,

158
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,972
there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

159
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,305
So take those for insomnia.

160
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,368
Give me a call if anything
changes. All right?

161
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,970
- All right.
- Do me a favor.

162
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,710
Stop being so hard on
yourself, Mr. Henderson.

163
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,411
Retirement can be
a tough transition.

164
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:20,475
All right?

165
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,564
Okay. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen.

166
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,601
Don't mix those sleeping
pills with alcohol

167
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,659
unless you want
to kill yourself.

168
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,964
Okay. Who's next?

169
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,305
<i>And for those of
you in the Southland,</i>

170
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:47,642
<i>tomorrow's gonna be
another beautiful day with</i>

171
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,272
<i>bright, sunny skies</i>

172
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,613
<i>and temperatures
into the mid-80s.</i>

173
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,549
<i>A perfect day for some golf.</i>

174
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,817
<i>And that's gonna continue
right into next week.</i>

175
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,791
<i>Gorgeous blue skies
and sensationally warm.</i>

176
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,020
<i>It doesn't get any
better than that.</i>

177
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,188
<i>This just in.</i>

178
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,993
<i>Soul music fans
around the globe</i>

179
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:09,432
<i>are mourning the
loss of Marcus Hooks.</i>

180
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,333
<i>The legendary
singer and songwriter</i>

181
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:13,770
<i>apparently suffered
a massive heart attack</i>

182
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,468
<i>while performing last night
in front of a capacity crowd</i>

183
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:19,444
<i>at Kungstrardgarden Park
in Stockholm, Sweden.</i>

184
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,037
<i>His body's being
flown home to New York,</i>

185
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,208
<i>where a memorial service
will be held next week.</i>

186
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:26,616
<i>The seven-time
Grammy Award winner</i>

187

<i>was 63 years old.</i>

188
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,550
<i>I'll do anything for you</i>

189
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:32,921
<i>We're back in just a moment.</i>

190
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,656
Humh!

191
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:39,160
Kezian Motors. Can I help you?

192
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,489
Who?

193
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,435
Hinds, telephone!

194
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,176
Dealing drugs
out of my garage?

195
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,373
Listen, you doing
something illegal,

196
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,281
I'll find out and send
your ass back to prison

197
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,684
so fucking fast, it will make
your black monkey head spin.

198
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:06,886
You know, there was a time

199
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,587
I would've knocked your
teeth down your throat

200
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:10,060
for saying some
shit like that to me.

201
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,460
But I'm a changed man.

202
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,556
I'm trying to be all
centered and shit.

203
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,625
Now, I could'a called you a
unibrow-shaving, pilaf-eating,

204
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:18,500
greasy-ass goat fucker,
but I didn't, did I?

205
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,766
- Uh-uh. - 'Cause I didn't
want to hurt your feelings,

206
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,432
and I didn't want
to piss you off,

207
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,738
just like I know
deep, deep down inside,

208
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,745
you don't want to
piss me off, either.

209
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:27,745
- Now, do
you? - Uh-uh.

210
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:29,179
Uh-uh.
No. Uh-uh.

211
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:30,375
All right.

212
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,145
Peace.

213
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:35,816
Scruffy, Kibbles...

214
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,447
Yeah, this is Louis.

215
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,320
Hey. Mr. Hinds.

216
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:41,690
It's Danny Epstein calling from
New York. How are you today?

217
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,058
<i>Who?</i>

218
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,061
Marty's son.

219
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,392
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

220
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:47,092
Shit,

221
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,963
I ain't seen you since
you were in diapers.

222
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:49,967
<i>Yeah. Well,</i>

223
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:50,968
I assume you heard

224
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,368
about Marcus' passing, yeah?

225
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,874
Oh, yeah. I'm crying the
tears of a motherfucking clown.

226
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,308
Okay. Here's the thing.
VH1 is putting together

227
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,141
a farewell tribute
at the Apollo,

228
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,306
<i>and they got a lot
of big names lined up.</i>

229
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,373
And they want Henderson
and Hinds to perform, right?

230
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,918
That's right! The Real
Deal back together again.

231
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:08,283
<i>It's a great opportunity.</i>

232
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:09,878
You talk to Floyd?

233
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,423
<i>I did.</i>

234
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:12,981
Mr. Henderson is in.

235
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:13,991
<i>Good.</i>

236
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,459
Then I'm out.

237
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,797
<i>Born under a bad sign</i>

238
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:32,840
<i>Been down since
I began to crawl</i>

239
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,013
<i>If it wasn't for bad luck</i>

240
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,280
<i>You know I wouldn't
have no luck at all</i>

241
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,423
<i>Hard luck and trouble...</i>

242
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,580
That is disgusting.

243
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:14,085
Ooh!

244
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:19,015
I don't believe this. Hmm.

245
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,457
Hey!

246
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:21,515
Uhh!

247
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,399
Ohh. Damn!

248
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,808
Ooh. Fuck happened, man?

249
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:42,041
Hell if I know. I came in,
found your ass laying there.

250
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,276
Bullshit. You looked
me dead in my eyes.

251
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,408
Man, you recognized me.

252
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:47,009
I didn't recognize
you. You done changed.

253
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,348
I come all the way down here,

254
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:50,855
and, man, you gonna
look me in my face

255
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,891
- and knock me the fuck out?
- Should've called first.

256
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,017
How the hell I'm gonna call

257
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:55,185
and you ain't got no phone?

258
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:57,229
What kind of person
ain't got no land phone?

259
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,093
Kind of person don't
want to get no calls.

260
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:00,655
You don't even
know why I came down

261
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,997
to this old fucked-up-the-ass
neighborhood.

262
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,560
I talked to little Ep.
I know why you're here.

263
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,004
And the answer is no.

264
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:11,066
Did he tell you we're at
the Apollo and they sold out?

265
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:13,078
Did he also tell you
who gonna be there?

266
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:16,172
Booker T. Jones. Isaac
Hayes. Bootsy Collins.

267
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,181
Shakira.

268
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,239
I don't care.

269
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,944
Do it for Marcus.

270
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,281
Fuck Marcus.

271
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:22,582
Well, do it for me.

272
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,555
- Fuck you!
- Come on, man.

273
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,216
- This is our shot.
- At what?

274
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,783
At a comeback, fool. If
we do this shit right,

275
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:31,091
we can get a record deal
and get back on the road

276
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,688
like we was 30 years ago.

277
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,494
I ain't trying to
be like 30 years ago!

278
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,034
I ain't trying to
make no comeback.

279
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,297
I'm gone, and I
want to stay gone.

280
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,337
Don't make me beg you, man.

281
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:48,336
Lao-Tzu says, "Free from
desire, "you realize the mystery.

282
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:51,781
"Caught in desire, you see
only the manifestations. "

283
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,442
What the fuck that
even mean, man?

284
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,147
That means...

285
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,457
get the fuck out.

286
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,060
Well, I guess you don't give a
fuck about the money, then, huh?

287
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:11,000
What money? It's a funeral!

288
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,334
Nobody get paid to
sing at no damn funeral!

289
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:15,806
How much?

290
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,240
40 grand.

291
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,971
Apiece?

292
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:20,239
No, down the middle.

293
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:23,339
No, no, no, no,
no, No, no, no, no!

294
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,644
That ain't even enough.

295
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,582
What the fuck you mean
that's not enough, man?

296
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:29,780
I got a lifestyle
to maintain here.

297
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:31,448
What kind of lifestyle, man,

298
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,048
you filthy motherfucker?

299
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:35,822
You got a pantry full of
dog food. I don't see no dog.

300
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:37,419
Dog under the bed,
nigger! You lucky

301
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:39,260
he ain't attacked your
ass when you came in.

302
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,323
You're the dog, motherfucker!

303
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,403
Look, man, what happened to all that
fucking money you done saved, man?

304
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:48,702
Saved? Shit.

305
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,242
I don't remember
shit from Watergate

306
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,834
to when the space
shuttle blew up.

307
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,072
Hmm. Money I saved.

308
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,671
Okay, what about the
royalties? I used to get

309
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,511
over $30,000 a
year off that shit.

310
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,347
I lost my royalties in
a poker game. All right?

311
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,649
- Poker?
- Listen here, man.

312
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,883
If you serious
about un-assing me

313
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:06,925
from my lavish
surroundings here,

314
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,893
man, you gonna have to
be a little more flexible

315
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:12,055
in your thinking. Say, oh...

316
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,155
60/40.

317
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,325
Man, you must be higher
than a motherfucker.

318
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,835
We always split shit
straight down the middle.

319
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,531
Ain't gonna be
nothing to split

320
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:20,867
if I don't show
up, now, is there?

321
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,239
And I ain't showing up unless
I get 60%% % of the proceeds.

322
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,538
You rich anyway, motherfucker.

323
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:28,409
I seen your little car
wash commercials on the TV.

324
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,279
I transferred all my business
affairs over to my nephew.

325
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,375
- I'm on a fixed income, man.
- So what?

326
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,352
So your drawers!

327
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:37,082
That's why that 20
damn thousand dollars

328
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,090
- look good to me right now.
- 16!

329
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,059
That's your cut
of a 60/40 split.

330
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:43,618
And those are my terms.

331
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,664
And they're non-negotiable.

332
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:51,493
55/45.

333
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,540
Fatherfuck you, man.

334
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:02,342
You're gonna tell me 60/40.

335
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:04,212
You don't dictate to me!

336
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:06,717
I'm Floyd
motherfucking Henderson.

337
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:08,310
You and Marc, I made you

338
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:09,911
and that motherfucker!

339
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:13,186
You can't sing, hum,
or motherfucking skip.

340
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,590
Ain't that a bitch?

341
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,457
Skip on these
motherfucking nuts!

342
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,064
You and Marcus, may
you rest in shit.

343
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:21,827
Motherfucker. I'm
Floyd fucking Henderson,

344
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,096
you Apostle-faced
motherfucker!

345
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:27,729
This motherfucker slams this
door in my face one more time...

346
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:29,399
I'm tired of
this motherfucker!

347
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,840
Always had a problem
with this bitch.

348
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,839
He ain't nothing.
He's ignorant!

349
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,076
Motherfucker's just a idiot.

350
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,618
Chihuahua-head motherfucker,
man, sitting up there,

351
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,779
always want to tell
somebody what to damn do.

352
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:45,289
He gonna sit there
and talk the fool?

353
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:48,191
Ooh, my blood pressure's
high, motherfucker.

354
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,353
Huh!

355
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:57,568
Don't let this motherfucker
get you like this.

356
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,394
Huhh!

357
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:04,935
What!

358
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,000
Stay!

359
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:14,618
First of all, I clearly want
to state this for the record.

360
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,815
And I find this arrangement
we got, man, despicable.

361
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,484
But I'm Floyd
Henderson. I'm a trouper.

362
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,959
And you know I'd do
any doggone thing, man,

363
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,860
to see this group
get back on its feet,

364
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,795
'cause you know that's the
type of motherfucker I am.

365
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,333
But in the meantime,

366
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:32,030
I'm going back to my
$600-a-night hotel room,

367
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:34,868
and I'm gonna have me
a nice hot bubble bath

368
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,465
to wash some of this
filth and dirt and grime

369
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:40,603
from this black fucking
hole you live in.

370
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,116
Then I'm having me a nice,
juicy-ass steak, oh, yeah,

371
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,947
the size of your
motherfucking back.

372
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,113
Then I'm gonna take me
a shit shower and shave.

373
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,157
And I'll be here at 6 a. m.

374
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:53,691
To take you to the
motherfucking airport.

375
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,953
You got me? I don't fly.

376
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,255
And I get up at 8.

377
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,697
My cousin out
the penitentiary,

378
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,597
I'm gonna have him
kill this motherfucker!

379
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:06,264
Man talk to me like
I'm a motherfucking kid.

380
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,465
I ain't no motherfucking kid.

381
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,872
Every time we... we
start on the road,

382
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:12,706
he starts in saying
the same shit.

383
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:15,176
Hey! Who's got my lunch?

384
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,179
Who are you?

385
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:17,306
I'm Phillip Newman, sir,

386
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:18,714
the new intern. You hired me,

387
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:19,978
like, 20 minutes ago.

388
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,519
Chuckles Newman's my uncle.

389
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:22,918
- He's the one that told you...
- Stop talking.

390
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,649
Very good. I already
got a job for you.

391
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:26,282
Okay? Bing, bang,
boom. Look at that.

392
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,850
Yeah. Henderson and Hinds,
Marcus' old backup singers,

393
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,759
are being real dickheads
about this tribute thing...

394
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,025
Oh, my God! Henderson
and Hinds! The Real Deal.

395
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,691
They're the only band that
got to play three songs

396
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,166
<i>on a sing episode
of Soul Train.</i>

397
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,897
Don Cornelius was there as a
witness, and I got it on VHS.

398
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:40,495
They don't do that
here. All right?

399
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,234
- Yes, sir.
- This is a record label,

400
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:43,366
not a fan club.

401
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,410
I want those two old
fucks there on Saturday,

402
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,105
and I want you to
make that happen.

403
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:48,111
Got it?

404
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,708
The Real Deal is back, and
they not gonna stop us now.

405
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,142
Uh-huh.

406
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:20,803
Ohh! Shit.

407
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,869
Ohh...

408
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,315
What the fuck is that, man?

409
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,782
This is a gun.

410
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:28,081
I never travel through
Klan country without one.

411
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:29,644
- You got a problem with that, pops?
- Yeah,

412
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:30,882
I got a problem
with that, man.

413
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,355
The last time I saw that gun,

414
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:33,949
you were pointing at me,
and you were shooting it.

415
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:36,256
Listen here, Floyd. We
ain't two old friends

416
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,386
out for some Sunday drive

417
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:38,760
down Memory Lane. All right?

418
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,732
Fact is, I can hardly
stand the sight of your ass,

419
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,167
so you best not to provoke me.

420
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:45,362
Or what's gonna happen?

421
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,099
There's a lot of empty road

422
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:49,368
between here and
where we trying to go.

423
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:50,568
Where a nigger could disappear

424
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,406
and where nobody'd
miss his black ass.

425
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:56,146
Well, let me see that gun.

426
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:58,941
Let me see it!

427
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:00,280
Be careful, fool.

428
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:02,320
You don't think I know
how to hold a gun, man?

429
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:03,980
I'm a member of the NRA, man.

430
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:05,683
Ohh!

431
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,851
Where's... Now,
what's... God damn it!

432
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:08,859
Oh! Shit!

433
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,257
- Damn!
- Ohh!

434
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,630
Drive! Drive! God
damn it it, drive!

435
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,667
- Ohh!
- Help me!

436
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:16,860
Aaahh!

437
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,164
Grab the wheel, fool!

438
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:21,365
- Look out!
- Now, turn! Turn!

439
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:24,374
Ohh!

440
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:26,240
What the hell is
wrong with you!

441
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,143
Don't shoot no gun in a car!

442
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,978
You said... The
safety wasn't on there.

443
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,847
Safety, my ass!

444
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,317
Safety wasn't...

445
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:35,375
Ohh...

446
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,156
NRA!

447
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,158
Negro Retards' Association!

448
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:42,160
Dumb motherfucker.

449
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,287
What the fuck is that?

450
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,089
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

451
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,226
Been a long time since
we saw our name in lights.

452
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,961
What our name
doing up in lights?

453
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,128
We're at the Apollo
Theater this weekend.

454
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:28,469
We ain't been on
stage in over 30 years.

455
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,133
Now, the last
thing you want to do

456
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:31,836
is stink up the
joint. Am I right?

457
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:33,572
And I got us free
dinner to boot.

458
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,555
Man, we sure are lucky
I kept these threads.

459
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:46,147
Do we look good!

460
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,420
Better hope that button
don't pop off and kill nobody.

461
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,888
God damn, I wish these pants
weren't squeezing my nuts so tight.

462
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:54,796
Maybe it'll help you
hit those high notes.

463
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,427
I don't need help
hitting the high notes.

464
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,801
Yeah, right. We'll
see. We'll see.

465
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,271
Ha ha! Busting out.

466
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:06,301
Ladies and gentlemen,

467
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,369
tonight, the
Flagstaff Motor Inn

468
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:11,109
is proud to present
to you back onstage

469
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:13,344
for the first time in
nearly three decades

470
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:16,388
the unforgettable
sweet soul sounds of...

471
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,620
The Real Deal!

472
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:24,924
Whoo!

473
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:34,937
Don't you ever

474
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:37,636
Be sad

475
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,837
Lean on me

476
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:41,573
When times are bad

477
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,582
When the day comes

478
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,550
And you are down

479
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:48,746
In a river of trouble

480
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,789
And are about to drown

481
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,687
Just hold on

482
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:55,659
I'm coming

483
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,889
Hold on

484
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,157
I'm coming

485
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,497
On my way

486
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,502
Your lover

487
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,561
When you be cold

488
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:07,731
I'll be your cover

489
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:11,071
Don't have to worry

490
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:13,338
- 'Cause I'm here
- Yeah.

491
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,539
No need to summon me there

492
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:16,979
'Cause I'm here

493
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,209
Yea-ah

494
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,012
Hold on

495
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:21,609
I'm coming

496
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,349
Yipes!

497
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,516
I'm coming

498
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,389
Just hold on

499
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,192
I'm coming

500
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:33,458
Just hold on

501
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:34,590
I'm coming

502
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:39,536
Look here. Reach out to me

503
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,971
for some satisfaction.

504
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:45,234
You know, Floyd,
all she got to do

505
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,074
Is call my name

506
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,672
For quick reaction

507
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:52,341
Yeah, yeah, yeah

508
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,384
Yeah

509
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:55,385
Ooh! Aah!

510
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:56,716
Ooh!

511
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:58,916
Ooh! Ooh, ooh! Ooh!

512
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,322
Aaah!

513
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:04,552
Lou, Lou, you all
right? You all right?

514
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,360
I can't breathe!

515
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,661
Louis.

516
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,429
Ohh! Keep going. Keep going.

517
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:11,434
I can't breathe.

518
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:19,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
please forgive us

519
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,202
for this technical difficulty.

520
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,678
Ow!

521
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,044
Aah!

522
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:24,946
Fucking eye, man!

523
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:27,042
I'm sorry, man. I got
on these tight slacks!

524
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,848
Well, then, I'll
sue your fat ass!

525
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:29,888
You sue these nuts.

526
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,718
- Go on, get on outta here.
- Jesus!

527
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,950
Take it from the top.

528
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,424
How are we gonna
take it from the top?

529
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:35,858
- I'm rewed up to go, man,
- You can't hardly breathe.

530
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:37,122
- You may need a chest X-ray.
- I'm good!

531
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,390
Is there a doctor
in the house?

532
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:40,364
I love you, Debbie.

533
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,593
Get off me, Ernest T!

534
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,397
Lou. Lou. Lou. Calm down, man.

535
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,097
Ain't but 12 motherfuckers
out here, man.

536
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:47,695
It's still a audience!

537
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,934
I don't care if it's two
or three. It's a audience.

538
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:51,100
That's what I'm talking about.

539
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:52,575
Your attitude is fd up.

540
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,908
Same thing that messed
us up back in the day.

541
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,107
No. You know what fucked
our shit up back in the day?

542
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,114
No. I don't know.

543
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,548
Oh, you know goddamn well

544
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:00,880
what fucked our shit
up back in the day.

545
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,614
- Oh, I do, huh?
- Yes, you do!

546
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,553
What fucked our shit
up back in the day

547
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:08,320
was you sticking your
johnson in my woman!

548
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:10,122
Ooh.

549
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

550
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:24,937
I'm Floyd Henderson.

551
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,637
This fool is Louis Hinds.

552
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,306
We are The Real Deal,
and that's for real.

553
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:33,750
I want to thank you for being
a super audience here tonight.

554
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,684
Motherfucker.

555
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,984
I'm sorry I hit you,
Debbie. Come back.

556
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,581
Shut the fuck up, or I'll
knock your dick in the dirt.

557
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,991
Drunk son of a bitch.

558
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,221
Ohh...

559
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,800
<i>Happy</i>

560
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,768
Hey, Louis, are we gonna
talk about last night,

561
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,327
or we just gonna
let it fester?

562
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,773
All right. Well, I was
a little rusty, okay?

563
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:00,436
That's a insult
to rust, ain't it?

564
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:02,104
Well, what about
you, motherfucker?

565
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,911
Last night, look like
you were stuck in cement.

566
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,177
I had a hip
replacement, Louis.

567
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,878
Well, you should've paid
a hundred more dollars

568
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:09,978
and got the deluxe model
with some rhythm in it.

569
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,886
'Cause that
motherfucker you got,

570
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:14,050
- it ain't working.
- Oh, that's fine, man.

571
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,184
But that's not what
we talking about.

572
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,818
I'm talking about Odetta.

573
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,888
Oh.

574
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:20,158
Louis, if I thought
there was still

575
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:21,699
- gonna be a problem between us...
- You went

576
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,667
where you shouldn't have gone,

577
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,134
period!

578
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:26,330
Now, there's some shit

579
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,236
that's just etched in stone.

580
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,207
First and foremost is

581
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:34,678
thou shall not dig for diamonds
in another brother's mine!

582
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,476
Bullshit, man. You gotta
take some responsibility here.

583
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:38,641
You think she
didn't know, man,

584
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:39,843
about all of your smoking

585
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,146
and drinking and drugs

586
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,687
and other women? She knew.

587
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:44,745
She came running to
me telling, "My man

588
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,815
Louis did this. Louis did
that. Hold me, Floyd. "

589
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:49,224
All right, well, getting
the pussy is one thing.

590
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,727
- You ain't had to marry her.
- What?

591
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:52,195
You'd have to be
a zip-down fool

592
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:53,925
to let her slide through
your fingers, man.

593
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,728
All right, well, if I'm
a fool, then you are, too.

594
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:58,565
You think I don't know
that? She hurt my heart, too.

595
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:02,198
Good! That's a poor
motherfucking comfort.

596
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,539
But it's comfort, nonetheless.

597
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,839
<i>Every night I'm telling</i>

598
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:08,436
<i>Whoopie</i>

599
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,572
<i>Every time you're
here, you're making</i>

600
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,514
<i>- Whoopie
- Whool</i>

601
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,074
<i>Whoopie</i>

602
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,387
Well, how many times did you
say you was married after Odetta?

603
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,894
Four.

604
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,026
Ohh!

605
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:34,038
I married this girl named
Estelle to get over Odetta.

606
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:35,573
Then I married Henrietta.

607
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,836
She wasn't no good for me.

608
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,207
Then I married Josephine.

609
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,247
She definitely wasn't no good
for me because she met Carl.

610
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,305
All right. That's three.

611
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:46,078
Who was lucky number four?

612
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:47,982
Her name was Consuelo.

613
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:50,681
She left me and
went back to Cuba.

614
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,748
Ha ha ha! People
actually go back to Cuba?

615
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,918
She said she'd rather
spend the rest of her life

616
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:58,326
under that dictatorship than
spend another night with me.

617
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,993
How 'bout you? How come
you never got married?

618
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,901
I almost hooked up with this
girl down in the Philippines,

619
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:06,960
in Manila.

620
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:11,171
- Wow.
- But, uh, I couldn't learn to speak

621
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:13,336
Tagalog, and only
English she knew

622
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:15,403
was, "Me love you long
time for two dollar. "

623
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,675
Yeah, I wasn't no good at
relationships after Odetta.

624
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,049
You ever hear from her?

625
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,348
Who, Mai Mai?

626
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:24,354
No. Odetta.

627
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:26,414
Oh. No, man.

628
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:28,886
I heard from her, man.

629
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,428
It was sometime
around Christmas.

630
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:33,362
You know, in that place she
was living in Tulsa. You know?

631
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:36,667
Fuck it. Pow,
pow, pow, pow, pow.

632
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:38,362
What you doing?

633
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,166
- I saw a coyote.
- Whyn't you put that thing up

634
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,535
before somebody get hurt, man?

635
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:42,971
How come you think I
don't know how to handle

636
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,406
- no damn piece, man?
- Think?

637
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:46,968
I know.

638
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:49,013
Yeah?

639
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,413
Yeah, come fuck
with me now, Louis.

640
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:52,950
Come on. You think
I'm soft, huh?

641
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:56,010
Yeah. I'll bust
one in your ass.

642
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,680
Floyd, you keep
fucking around,

643
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,587
I'm gonna stick that
gun so far up your ass,

644
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,489
you gonna taste gunpowder
every time you talk.

645
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,391
- Well, let me...
- Shit!

646
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:10,031
God damn it!

647
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:11,660
Louis, that was a
accident. I swear.

648
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,830
I'm sweating. My hand's wet.

649
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:15,338
You all right?

650
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:16,874
You warm? You hot?

651
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:18,807
You dizzy? You light-headed?

652
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:21,175
Louis, I swear I would
never want to hurt you, man.

653
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:23,476
I thought about killing you,
but I'd never want to hurt you.

654
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:26,016
<i>All right. In our continuing
tribute to Marcus Hooks,</i>

655
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,746
<i>we're reaching all the
way back in this next song.</i>

656
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,721
Lou. That's us, man.

657
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,781
<i>Listen... Martin
Hooks and The Real Deal.</i>

658
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,420
<i>Number 3 in 1969...
"I'm Your Puppet. "</i>

659
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,261
<i>Pull the string</i>

660
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,734
<i>And I'll wink at you</i>

661
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,600
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

662
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:50,570
<i>Mm-hmm, yeah</i>

663
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:52,473
<i>I'll do funny things</i>

664
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:55,172
<i>If you want me to</i>

665
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:56,407
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

666
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:58,506
Come on, Lou.

667
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:06,250
I'll say this for him...
that motherfucker could sing.

668
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,724
No doubt. No doubt. Come
on, help me... help me out.

669
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:09,886
- Second verse.
- Second?

670
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,087
"Pull my strings. " Kiss.

671
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:12,095
<i>...your puppet</i>

672
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:13,791
- What...
- You ready?

673
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:15,765
1, 2, 3.

674
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:16,766
Hit it.

675
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:18,132
<i>Pull another string</i>

676
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:21,036
...ing, and I'll
kiss your lips

677
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,596
I'm your puppet

678
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:24,904
<i>Ohh, ohh, ohh</i>

679
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,739
<i>- Tap.
- Yeah</i>

680
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,871
Snap your fingers

681
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:29,971
And I'll turn

682
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,345
You some flips

683
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,610
I'm your puppet

684
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:35,653
- Man, my hip hurt like anything.
- Drop step.

685
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,746
Drop step? You know I
can't do that right now.

686
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:39,756
Go, Lou.

687
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:41,156
- Owww!
- Man.

688
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:43,854
Oh, sweet. Do it, Louie.

689
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:44,861
<i>...do is wiggle...</i>

690
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,625
Oh! Oh! Oh!

691
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:49,166
I'm your puppet

692
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:51,828
<i>- Oh, yes, I am
- One more time.</i>

693
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:53,370
<i>- There you go, Floyd.
- I'm your puppet</i>

694
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:54,632
Oh! Come on now.

695
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:56,173
<i>- Mmm, yeah
- Yeah, I got it now.</i>

696
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,230
<i>- I got it.
- Yeah</i>

697
00:29:57,976 --> 00:29:59,307
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

698
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:01,675
So where'd you book us next?

699
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:03,043
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

700
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,078
This is it?

701
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,484
Come on, children

702
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,051
And gather around

703
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,064
Want y'all to see

704
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,293
We're putting down

705
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:25,029
It's a thing

706
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:26,968
Everybody can do

707
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:28,972
So come on, children

708
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,406
Do the boogie, too

709
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,410
Boogie ain't nothing

710
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,469
But gettin' down

711
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,674
Boogie ain't nothing

712
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,649
But gettin' down

713
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:48,356
I got to boogie for you

714
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:49,484
Floyd Henderson

715
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:50,926
What is it?

716
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:52,964
- Boogie on
down - Whoo-hoo!

717
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:54,259
Louis Hinds

718
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:57,062
Boogie on down

719
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,193
Listen to the band

720
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,363
We'll make it through

721
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:02,998
All we got

722
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:05,440
Is the boogie, too

723
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:13,777
I got to boogie for you

724
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:16,013
Whoo

725
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:19,352
Hey, you, what you got, baby?
You got to boogie for me?

726
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:22,825
Come on, now. Oh, yeah

727
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:24,862
Come on.

728
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,864
Yeehaw!

729
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:29,162
Come on, fiddler.

730
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,327
I knew you were gonna
try to take over.

731
00:31:32,604 --> 00:31:35,004
Look at him.

732
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:37,473
Go on, Lou.

733
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,510
- Come on.
- Oww!

734
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,239
Boogie ain't nothing

735
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:43,406
But gettin' down

736
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:45,642
Boogie ain't nothing

737
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,083
But gettin' down

738
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:50,815
Boogie ain't nothing
but getting down

739
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:51,981
Ow!

740
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,888
Boogie ain't nothing

741
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,722
But getting down

742
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:58,228
Come on. I got
to boogie for you

743
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:04,894
I got to boogie for you

744
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,404
I got nothing but boogie

745
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:09,599
- Nothing but boogie for you
- Ooh

746
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:11,335
- I got nothing but boogie
- Yeah

747
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,842
Nothing but boogie for you

748
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:15,573
- Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
- Oh, yeah

749
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:17,945
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie

750
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,711
- Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
- Oh, yeah

751
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,615
I got to boogie for you

752
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:24,883
Aah!

753
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:32,820
Share the love, baby.

754
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:35,092
All right, all right.

755
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,929
You know you pulled the
Al Green up there, right?

756
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,697
No, I didn't, Lou.
Don't start that...

757
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,896
We barely got offstage

758
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,632
when you ran your
ass back out there.

759
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:44,300
Look, an encore is at
the audience's discretion.

760
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:45,934
You're supposed to wait
till they ask for it.

761
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:47,706
- You know they wanted it.
- I don't care what they wanted.

762
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,542
That shit was unprofessional.

763
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:50,945
Man...

764
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,216
Say,

765
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,587
I'm starting to remember
why I love the road so much.

766
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:02,092
Yeah.

767
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,160
Mmm.

768
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,292
If my instincts
serve me right,

769
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:12,427
you're about to find
yourself another room tonight.

770
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:15,337
You know those little blue
pills make you go blind, right?

771
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,375
Mmm, mmm.

772
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:21,368
Don't call me when you get
that four-hour erection.

773
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:22,970
Hey, now, baby girl.

774
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:28,578
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

775
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:30,518
Oh. Aah!

776
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:31,680
Yeah, give it to me.

777
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:34,749
Those little pills,
give me strength.

778
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:35,986
A little strength.

779
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,961
Ugh!

780
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:39,291
I'm going to fuck
your brains out.

781
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:42,128
Oh! Oh, you're heavy.

782
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:45,967
Uh,

783
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,164
what's wrong, baby?

784
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,501
Nothing.

785
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,873
I just, uh, you know, I...

786
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:55,139
I just never been with
someone like you before.

787
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:57,875
It's true what they say. But
let me tell you something.

788
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:00,315
Floyd Henderson gonna
be nice and gentle.

789
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:02,080
Your first taste of dark meat

790
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:03,984
gonna be smooth
and sweet, trust me.

791
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:05,215
No, I didn't mean that.

792
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,588
It's just, uh, you know,

793
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:10,992
I've never been
with someone so old.

794
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:12,222
Old?

795
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:14,891
You ain't no teen
queen your damn self.

796
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,831
Huh.

797
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:18,163
Come on, come on, come on.

798
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:19,828
Come on, mama.
Come here, baby.

799
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,132
Baby, baby. Look here.

800
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:24,403
Let's take our decades
of sexual experience

801
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:26,171
and combine them for one night

802
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:28,041
of exploration and
bliss, can we do that?

803
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:32,179
I won't disappoint you.

804
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,514
All right.

805
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,645
That's what I'm talking about.

806
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:38,052
I want to suck one
of them titties.

807
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:40,591
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
something to show you.

808
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:41,750
- Ooh.
- Ooh, hoo.

809
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:44,021
I'm so hot, I'm
about to fuck myself.

810
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,287
Bite my lip off.

811
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:48,229
Oh. Look!

812
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:49,732
Oh, shoot, I'm leaking, girl.

813
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,393
Tonight I ain't got no
control like that no more.

814
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,200
Now, I hope you don't
mind a little hair.

815
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:59,004
Baby, I found my sexual
awakening in the '60s.

816
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:02,604
Nothing I like better
than a big old fluffy...

817
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:06,043
Damn, girl.

818
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:08,051
That's a whole bunch of
hair you got down there.

819
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,087
Yeah, I call it
the natural look.

820
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:12,453
You sick?

821
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:14,321
I know it's big.

822
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:15,984
You need a pick.

823
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,357
You want me to shave it?

824
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,592
We ain't got the time or
apparatus for that type of job.

825
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,394
Okay, disregard.

826
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:23,593
Oh!

827
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:24,828
- Oh!
- Oh!

828
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:27,428
Look who's coming to dinner.

829
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,336
Right on time, ain't it?

830
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:30,840
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

831
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,570
Oh.

832
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:33,702
You know what I'm
gonna do for you?

833
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:35,177
What you fixing to do?

834
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,111
You ever had a velveteen rub?

835
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:39,548
A velveteen rub.

836
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:42,017
Ain't... Ain't no cheese
involved, is there?

837
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:43,986
Because I'm
lactose intolerant.

838
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,389
Oh, yeah.

839
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:02,334
Ooh!

840
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:03,965
You're choking my chicken!

841
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:17,313
Ugh!

842
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:19,721
Ugh.

843
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:21,759
That's quite a
show you got going

844
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:23,794
under the big
top there, Sparky.

845
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,329
I had to take another
one of them damn pills

846
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:26,624
in the middle of
the night, man.

847
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:28,666
This woman insatiable,
man. I'm shooting dust.

848
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:31,634
Oh, Floyd.

849
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:32,829
I'm right here, baby.

850
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:34,064
You ready for some more?

851
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:35,162
Yeah, come here.

852
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,938
Come here.

853
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,035
Hi.

854
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:43,808
Think about that, boy.

855
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:45,941
There's my stallion.

856
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,279
Huh?

857
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:49,013
- I missed you.
- Oh, you missed me?

858
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:50,179
Mmm-hmm.

859
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:52,223
Mmm. You need a little
air on this thing.

860
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,383
Yeah.

861
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,654
Oh, you bad boy.

862
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,355
God damn.

863
00:36:58,429 --> 00:36:59,987
You like that, huh?

864
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:01,656
I'm your little kitty cat.

865
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:06,036
Chastity?

866
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:09,266
Mama?

867
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,568
You little whore.

868
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:12,109
You're one to talk.

869
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:14,576
Oh, did you take out
your teeth for him?

870
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,637
You watch how you
talk to your mama.

871
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:18,306
Please, you can't
talk to me like that.

872
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:19,441
You're not my daddy.

873
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:20,541
That's right,
who's your daddy?

874
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:21,744
- You're my daddy.
- Your big daddy.

875
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:24,611
Rosalee, are you in there?

876
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:27,214
Actually, that's my daddy.

877
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,486
Oh.

878
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:31,920
What are you thinking, Mama?

879
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:33,020
You ruined everything.

880
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:35,156
- I hate you.
- You little brat.

881
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,326
You're a dirty...
all right, I love you.

882
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:38,926
- Mmm.
- Call me a lot of times.

883
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:41,301
Mama, what is wrong with you?

884
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,602
- I renounce you. You're a whore.
- Aah!

885
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:45,438
- I'm a whore?
- Yeah.

886
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,035
You just shamed the whole
family, you and the black man.

887
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:52,746
Whoa!

888
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:54,682
Whoo! That was fun.

889
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:04,586
<i>So come, take me by the hand</i>

890
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:06,596
<i>We'll leave this troubled land</i>

891
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:08,222
<i>- Yeah.
- I know we can</i>

892
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,527
<i>I know we can</i>

893
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,795
I'll be damned, man.

894
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,631
Them broads stole
our money, man.

895
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:14,194
Whoo, yeah,

896
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,672
but they earned it.

897
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:19,304
Hello.

898
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:20,844
<i>Yeah, man. It's
Floyd Henderson, man.</i>

899
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:22,072
<i>We got a situation.</i>

900
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:23,238
What's the problem?

901
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,906
Well, my ex-partner,

902
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,450
the degenerate
that he is, man,

903
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:29,577
got some trailer trash
hos, man, rip us off.

904
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,315
<i>Oh, wow, I'm
sorry to hear that.</i>

905
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:32,686
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

906
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:34,748
Yeah, there's something
you can do. We need money.

907
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:35,918
<i>If we don't get no money,</i>

908
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:37,461
<i>we ain't gonna make
it to the Apollo.</i>

909
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,826
I'm not sure what the
procedure for that would be.

910
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:42,024
I mean, there's just
a lot of red tape here.

911
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,533
You know, uh...

912
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,626
I'm going to have
to get back to you.

913
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:48,297
<i>- You do that. Get back with me now.
- Mr. Henderson...</i>

914
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:51,342
We ain't gonna get very
far on ten gallons of gas,

915
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,775
I can tell you that.

916
00:38:53,845 --> 00:38:55,608
I know where we
can get some money.

917
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,942
I know how to get some money.

918
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:07,348
<i>Ain't no love, ain't no love</i>

919
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:12,627
<i>Like my baby's love</i>

920
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:15,894
<i>Ain't no lonely days</i>

921
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:18,926
<i>Ain't no lonely</i>

922
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:21,335
Ooh, shit. What the hell is...

923
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:26,810
<i>'Cause I ain't never,
never found me a girl</i>

924
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,210
Oh, hell, no. You didn't.

925
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,009
Yes, I did.

926
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,073
<i>- To love me like
- I do</i>

927
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:35,483
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

928
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:36,611
Hey.

929
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,417
Hey, hey, you're...
What is wrong with you?

930
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,218
Don't be grabbing
on me like that now.

931
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,725
I will knock your ass out before
I let you go ring that doorbell.

932
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:44,227
Come on, get up on
me, man. Come on.

933
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:46,024
You really want this? Huh?

934
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:47,826
- Huh?
- Come on... Oh! God damn.

935
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:48,991
- Oh, man. Come on...
- What?

936
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,466
- Oh!
- What's wrong, what?

937
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:51,661
I got a pain in my chest, man.

938
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:53,260
Come on, man. Stop
fucking with me.

939
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:54,361
Look like I'm
fucking with you, man?

940
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,531
Come on, man, do me a favor.

941
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:57,096
Get my heart medicine
out of my bag.

942
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:59,268
- You got some heart med...
- Oh! Come on, look.

943
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:01,607
Come on, man. Hurry up, man.

944
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:04,876
Hold on, man!

945
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:08,775
God damn, you got enough stuff
in here to start a drug store!

946
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:10,252
What it say on the bottle?

947
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,619
Sucker, motherfucker.

948
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:19,527
I'm gonna get
your ass for this.

949
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:21,758
I'll leave the
light on for you.

950
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,229
What up, dawg?

951
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:29,102
Um...

952
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:31,198
We're friends
of, uh, Odetta's.

953
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:33,766
- Odetta?
- Yeah, is she in?

954
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:35,540
No, she ain't here, man.

955
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,877
Is she coming back?

956
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:39,143
Seriously doubt it.

957
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:42,380
Not unless we fitting to have
a zombie attack or some shit.

958
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:44,387
Eee!

959
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:45,649
What's up, Fu Manchu?

960
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:47,588
- Cleo!
- Yeah?

961
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:48,920
Get your ass out here!

962
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:51,325
Two old niggers
looking for your mama.

963
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,088
Come on in, man. You're
letting the heat out.

964
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,293
Mama?

965
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:58,426
Cold outside.

966
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:00,164
Your arthritis gonna kick up.

967
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,471
Who's that?

968
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,033
I don't know.

969
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,275
Yeah?

970
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:14,978
Uh, how you doing, ma'am?

971
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:16,417
My name is Floyd
Henderson. This is my...

972
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:18,352
I know who you are.

973
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:20,083
Guess you didn't hear
about the funeral.

974
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:22,922
Funeral? Odetta...

975
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:24,086
When did she pass?

976
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:26,289
Well, she got sick
right after Christmas.

977
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:29,299
After that, it
went pretty fast.

978
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,460
So why'd you come to see her?

979
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:32,696
What, she owe you
money or something?

980
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,000
- Oh, no.
- We just in the neighborhood.

981
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:37,540
Cleo, I can't
find the bologna!

982
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:39,371
I'll be there in a minute!

983
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,172
Hurry up!

984
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:45,705
Well, if my mama wasn't dead,
I'd tell her you stopped by.

985
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:47,045
Cleo!

986
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:50,144
- Just hold on a
second. - C-L-E-O!

987
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:51,245
- What the hell you want?
- I'm sorry...

988
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:52,584
I told you this was a
bad idea to come here.

989
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:53,954
Come on, man. Don't go there.

990
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,049
Let's just go, okay?

991
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:56,150
How old you think she is?

992
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:57,626
27, 28?

993
00:41:57,695 --> 00:41:59,526
I don't know how old she is,
and I don't care. Let's go.

994
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:00,757
Chillax, let me see something.

995
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:02,197
What are you doing?

996
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,461
Floyd, what the hell
are you looking for?

997
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:05,661
Damn it.

998
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,033
I'm just confirming
a suspicion.

999
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:08,662
That's all I'm doing.

1000
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,867
September 14, 1981. Bingo.

1001
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:14,173
It kind of works
itself out, don't it?

1002
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:15,439
Put it back.

1003
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:18,308
Listen.

1004
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:19,781
Odetta left me, man,

1005
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:22,479
Thanksgiving Day, man, 1980.

1006
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:24,544
- So?
- So you do the math, motherfucker.

1007
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:27,182
Do the math? Nigga, please...

1008
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:28,691
<i>Oh, shit. You hear that?</i>

1009
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:29,953
Hear what?

1010
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:32,689
Listen, that bass
line, right there.

1011
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,924
Hmm?

1012
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,728
Son of a bitch.

1013
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:40,165
Oh, my name is Lester,
the Court Jester

1014
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,206
All you other rap
niggas done messed up

1015
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:43,763
I take you to
school a semester

1016
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,331
Take you to court
and sequester

1017
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:47,343
- Yeah!
- I'm judge and the jury

1018
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:49,106
<i>Bruce Lee, Fists of Fury.</i>

1019
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,375
You want to whip
me, the L-E-S-T-E-R

1020
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,082
Grab my girl by the waist

1021
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:55,448
Slap my girl in the face

1022
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,714
When my mama died, I
moved inside her crib

1023
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,586
Hey, hey. Les, Les.

1024
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:02,558
Hey, man, what
you doing in here?

1025
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:04,788
We're here trying
to make some music.

1026
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:07,353
That what y'all doing?

1027
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:08,625
I don't see no musicians.

1028
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,065
Listen, you know who
played the base line

1029
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:13,797
on that stuff you got running
under those so-called lyrics?

1030
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,499
My man, right there.

1031
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,272
Yeah, right, man.

1032
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:22,870
He ain't no damn
instrumentator.

1033
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:24,574
Hey, yo, Big L, check it
out, man. It's them, man.

1034
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:25,843
They ain't bullshitting.

1035
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,179
Let me see this here.

1036
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:29,549
The Real Deal, huh?

1037
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,316
Hey, I mean, so what if we
jacked your shit, man? Huh?

1038
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,824
Good artists borrow,

1039
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,723
great artists steal, man.

1040
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:39,262
- You know who said that?
- Pablo Picasso.

1041
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,458
But literary scholars sometimes
like to attribute it to T.S. Eliot.

1042
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:45,934
Hell, no. It wasn't no
damn Missy Elliot, man.

1043
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,233
No, man, it was
Bay Bay and them.

1044
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:49,432
Bay Bay, yup.

1045
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:51,805
That was Bay Bay, for
sure, hey, Bay Bay.

1046
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:52,900
Look, man.

1047
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:54,638
You know what? I'm sorry.

1048
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,771
I shouldn't have sampled
your music without permission.

1049
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:59,111
Why don't we all
do a song together?

1050
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:01,651
A song called "Fuck You
and Your Bass Line. "

1051
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,482
That's what I feel about it.

1052
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,488
Here what I think about
your damn bassline.

1053
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:08,150
Henderson and Hinds!

1054
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:09,249
Take that shit with you.

1055
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:10,919
Gold-faced motherfucker.

1056
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:12,121
I made that shit gangster,
that's what I did.

1057
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:13,595
Let me tell you
something, man, you...

1058
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,791
Hey! Stop it!

1059
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:19,664
Stop it!

1060
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:21,432
Hey! This is my
house. You hear me?

1061
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:22,870
I don't need this
shit right now.

1062
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,999
You gonna talk to me
crazy in front of my boys?

1063
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:27,306
Why you still talking?
Shut the fuck up!

1064
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:29,778
Pay-Pay
and Zig-Zig,

1065
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,872
let's dip, man.

1066
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,749
Bye, old niggers.

1067
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,312
Feel free to utilize my
facilities while you're here

1068
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,687
to make yourself another hit.

1069
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:44,194
I know you ain't had a
hit since Ike hit Tina.

1070
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:45,228
Get out of here.

1071
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:48,356
Get the fuck

1072
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:50,696
Out my grill

1073
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:53,168
'Fore you get killed

1074
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:55,933
My name is Lester
the Court Jester.

1075
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,874
What a disrespectful
son of a bitch.

1076
00:44:58,943 --> 00:45:01,343
- Just lay off.
- Just lay off?

1077
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,039
I know your mama
taught you better.

1078
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:04,581
Odetta would've
whooped his damn ass.

1079
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,980
The fuck you know about
what my mama would've done.

1080
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:09,383
Were you here when she
was dying of that cancer?

1081
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,887
I don't think so. I think
Lester was. The hell you know.

1082
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,218
You're right. I
don't know nothing.

1083
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,689
That's right, he
don't know shit.

1084
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,522
No, he don't.

1085
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:19,392
Now I'm going to go change
and get dinner started

1086
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:21,055
because you guys
are staying, right?

1087
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:22,258
Oh, no. We need
to hit the road.

1088
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,392
Yes, ma'am. We are staying.

1089
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,732
Okay, then.

1090
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,371
Hell, it's what
Mama would've wanted.

1091
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:34,536
Oh, yeah. That's
Odetta's child, all right.

1092
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:45,385
Okay, I put some sheets on the
bed in the guest room for you guys.

1093
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:47,686
Thank you.

1094
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:49,885
That's Carla Thomas, right?

1095
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,554
Sure is. Your
mother's favorite.

1096
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:57,325
So how come you guys only
put out that one album?

1097
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:01,270
Well, when we wasn't
fighting over your mother,

1098
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:02,600
we had a problem
in our record sales.

1099
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:04,641
Yeah, as in we
didn't sell any.

1100
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,868
Okay.

1101
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:10,808
Well, you'd never
know it wasn't a hit,

1102
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:12,906
as much as Mama played it.

1103
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:20,821
About 100 degrees, and you
got a leather jacket on.

1104
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,153
Appreciate it, Sam.

1105
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:25,888
She said,

1106
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:27,624
being on the road with y'all

1107
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:30,963
was some of the best
times of her life.

1108
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,664
Oh, good days. Good days.

1109
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:37,332
I wish I could've seen that.

1110
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:41,640
Say, why don't you
come to Memphis with us?

1111
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:43,839
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

1112
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:45,848
- What?
- We got a gig.

1113
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,008
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Floyd, Floyd.

1114
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:48,176
The girl got a life.

1115
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:49,344
She ain't got
time to be ripping,

1116
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,853
running up and down the
road with two old niggers.

1117
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:52,388
Why not?

1118
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,016
Memphis is fun. We always
have fun in Memphis.

1119
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:56,184
You'll enjoy it. Trust me.

1120
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,889
Fun? Look like I
got time for fun?

1121
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:02,225
Nah.

1122
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:11,975
Hey, Louis.

1123
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:15,102
You know, Cleo was telling me

1124
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:17,204
that Odetta never told her
nothing about her father,

1125
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:19,545
not even his name.

1126
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:21,380
But she did say
he was a musician.

1127
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:22,976
You ain't said nothing
stupid to the girl, have you?

1128
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:24,145
Like what?

1129
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:27,019
Oh, like, uh,

1130
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,319
Cleo, you know,
I'm your daddy.

1131
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:31,054
Well, I'm still feeling
out the situation.

1132
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:32,390
What the fuck was that

1133
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:34,090
that "You ought to come
to Memphis with us" shit?

1134
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:37,498
Now that, right there,
that's a recipe for disaster.

1135
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,833
Louis, Louis, I know
this ain't easy for you.

1136
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:43,373
But I never thought
I'd have a child.

1137
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,237
Now I'm part of this big
old circle called life.

1138
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:50,303
A piece of Floyd Henderson,
man, might be here to live on,

1139
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:51,814
and maybe forever.

1140
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:53,747
If you don't shut
up and go to sleep,

1141
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:57,184
a big piece of Floyd Henderson ass
might not wake up in the morning.

1142
00:47:57,254 --> 00:47:59,017
Oh, Louis, Louis.

1143
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:00,647
I respect the
fact that you want

1144
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:03,124
to cloak your pain
with your anger.

1145
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:12,025
Good night.

1146
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,843
Oh, hey! What
the fuck is that?

1147
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:21,969
What's wrong?

1148
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:23,638
You been taking them
dick pills again?

1149
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:26,080
I though it was my cholesterol
meds, I swear I did.

1150
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,414
You can't be spooning with
a motherfucker with that!

1151
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:29,645
What's wrong with you?

1152
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,245
- Uh, I...
- Nasty son of a bitch!

1153
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:33,813
Give me some covers. I'm
gonna sleep on the floor.

1154
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:34,949
Shit.

1155
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:36,549
Go on, then.
Sleep on the floor.

1156
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:37,685
Nobody wants you, Louis.

1157
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,661
I don't like boy pussy no way.

1158
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,197
I hope your back hurt
like a motherfucker.

1159
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:43,699
Better my back
than my asshole.

1160
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:45,860
Nasty... I'll beat
your motherfucking...

1161
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:47,836
All them years I
spent in prison,

1162
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:49,839
ain't nobody roll
up on me like that.

1163
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:51,499
I was going to
ask you about that.

1164
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:53,873
You ought to be ashamed
of your goddamn self,

1165
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:55,377
nasty son of a bitch.

1166
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,122
Like I never had

1167
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:25,875
When I'm feeling bad

1168
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:29,572
Come on and comfort me

1169
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:33,378
Oh, baby, you know the way

1170
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,214
I showed you how
to love me right

1171
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:41,987
So comfort me tonight

1172
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:46,462
Come on and comfort me, honey

1173
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:53,837
You know the way, baby

1174
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:56,896
'Cause I showed you right

1175
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,710
I want it, I want it

1176
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:07,046
Why don't you

1177
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:13,180
Comfort me?

1178
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:29,903
Floyd!

1179
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:37,673
Yo.

1180
00:50:37,748 --> 00:50:39,010
<i>Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson?</i>

1181
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,243
No, this is Louis.

1182
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:41,978
Mr. Hinds.

1183
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:43,781
It's Phillip Newman
of FC Management.

1184
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:45,515
How are you, man?
I'm a huge fan.

1185
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:47,022
So?

1186
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:49,286
So...

1187
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,387
I think I've solved your
cash flow problems, my man.

1188
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:55,932
I've withdrawn $10,000

1189
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:57,489
from my old parents'
savings account

1190
00:50:57,568 --> 00:50:59,729
to tide you over until
things get sorted out.

1191
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:01,031
Who'd you say you was again?

1192
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:02,197
<i>Phillip.</i>

1193
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:03,796
I wrote you letters
when the man had you

1194
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:05,671
locked down in
the pen, you know?

1195
00:51:05,743 --> 00:51:08,109
I know you're innocent.
Shit ain't right.

1196
00:51:09,113 --> 00:51:12,082
Okay, Phillip, um, look here.

1197
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:13,173
We're on our way to Memphis.

1198
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,309
Um, why don't you meet us

1199
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:18,617
at, um, the fountain
at Peabody Hotel,

1200
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:20,987
<i>5:00?</i>

1201
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:23,925
Memphis. All right!

1202
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:26,653
I'm hungrier than a mo...

1203
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,164
There you are, girl.
You make up your mind?

1204
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,723
You want to go to
Memphis with us, or not?

1205
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:32,359
What you gonna do?

1206
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:36,630
What happened?

1207
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,973
Nothing. Nothing happened.

1208
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,211
Nothing happened.

1209
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:46,546
- No. -
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1210
00:51:46,617 --> 00:51:48,107
Let him get his whupping.

1211
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:00,619
Why you hit her?

1212
00:52:00,697 --> 00:52:04,098
The hell you gonna
do about it, man?

1213
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:05,965
I'm the nigger
with the gun, man.

1214
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:07,128
Oh, shit.

1215
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:09,968
Damn! Ugh!

1216
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,132
- Aah!
- Come on.

1217
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:14,939
Get your albino Ike
Turner ass up, uh-huh.

1218
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:16,274
Come on.

1219
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:19,440
Aah! Okay! Oh, shit! Aah!

1220
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:21,040
My follicles, man!

1221
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:24,087
Look her in the eye and
say "I'm sorry I hit you,

1222
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:25,644
and I'm never gonna put
my hands on you again. "

1223
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:28,350
- My bad, baby. I ain't...
- Say what I told you to say!

1224
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:30,757
I'm sorry I hit you. I ain't
never gonna do it again.

1225
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:33,388
Now, say you're sorry
for sampling my bass line

1226
00:52:33,464 --> 00:52:35,659
and for stomping on
my partner's record.

1227
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:38,326
I'm sorry for
sampling your bass line

1228
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:41,064
- and stomping on your Real Deal record.
- Okay.

1229
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:42,969
Now, we taking a road trip,
and we need some gas money.

1230
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,803
I ain't got no money, man!

1231
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,309
Can you help us? I saw you
out there selling that shit.

1232
00:52:47,377 --> 00:52:49,004
It's weed, it ain't
crack man! I ain't got...

1233
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,910
- Give me the money!
- Okay, okay.

1234
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:52,243
There's money in my shorts...

1235
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,806
Ain't nobody reaching in
your drawers, get it out!

1236
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:55,511
Okay, okay.

1237
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:58,953
I got to reach
around my meat, man.

1238
00:53:00,324 --> 00:53:02,258
- Here.
- Take it.

1239
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:04,021
Take it.

1240
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:07,223
Oh, damn. My hair hurts.

1241
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:08,889
Take it, man! Aah!

1242
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:09,898
Ow! You're breaking my arm!

1243
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:11,264
Oh, hush.

1244
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:13,360
That's just a little
Chinese submission hold.

1245
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:15,735
This is what it feels
like when I break your arm.

1246
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,040
- Shit!
- Break his arm.

1247
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:21,600
Oh, bastard!

1248
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:23,771
I know motherfuckers
like you, Lester.

1249
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:26,077
Used to see them in
the yard every day.

1250
00:53:26,149 --> 00:53:29,312
You'd better hope you
don't never go inside

1251
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:32,844
because you, you straight
up bitch material.

1252
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,322
What about my car, man?

1253
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:35,517
What about your car?

1254
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:37,560
Oh, shit.

1255
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:38,754
I ain't got no clothes on.

1256
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:40,194
This is bullshit.

1257
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:41,993
So what? You run
around with your drawers

1258
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:43,430
hanging off your ass anyway.

1259
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,627
I wasn't really
gonna shoot you!

1260
00:53:45,702 --> 00:53:46,794
Get the fuck out of here.

1261
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,861
See, I'm the nigger
with the gun now.

1262
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,930
You better hope my
arm don't get better.

1263
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:53,203
I'm gonna learn karate
and kick your ass!

1264
00:53:53,277 --> 00:53:54,744
Fuck you!

1265
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,613
It was a good
thing you stepped in

1266
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:00,240
when you did what
you did, partner,

1267
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:01,750
because if I'd have
got a piece of him,

1268
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:04,514
I'd have fucked his shit up
entirely, and you know that.

1269
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:05,850
Come on.

1270
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:07,720
I'm too old to be tussling
with the motherf...

1271
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,816
I'd have shot him.
I'd have popped...

1272
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:12,418
I'm six, seven years older.
I'd have, like, tussled...

1273
00:54:15,532 --> 00:54:16,794

00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:26,408
<i>They're back in
Memphis tonight</i>

1279
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:28,467

1280
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:30,638
<i>Train number 1 is gone</i>

1281
00:54:30,714 --> 00:54:32,375
<i>Welcome back home, fellas.</i>

1282
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:36,283
<i>Train number 2 is gone</i>

1283
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:39,754
<i>Train number 3 is been gone</i>

1284
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:43,054
How long must I wait for you

1285
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:44,718
<i>Look out with it.</i>

1286
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:46,387
<i>Whoo, hey, yeah</i>

1287
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:49,762
<i>It's the Memphis train</i>

1288
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,267
The Orpheum Theatre!

1289
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:54,327
Our show's up in there.

1290
00:54:55,772 --> 00:54:58,639
<i>How long must I wait for you?</i>

1291
00:54:58,709 --> 00:55:01,803
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1292
00:55:01,878 --> 00:55:03,539
<i>Ooh, wee</i>

1293
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,741
<i>The Memphis train</i>

1294
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:08,148
<i>Let me try it one more time</i>

1295
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:11,051
<i>Say, ooh, ooh, ooh, wee</i>

1296
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:13,612
Oh, my God.

1297
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,453
Mr. Henderson, Mr. Hinds,

1298
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:16,753
let me just start
off by saying...

1299
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:18,124
Thank you.

1300
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,427
What's up?

1301
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,230
Phillip, tonight we're
playing at the House of Soul.

1302
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:27,634
Make sure you be there, baby.

1303
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,639
Right on.

1304
00:55:30,707 --> 00:55:33,403
Hello. Welcome to the
Peabody. How can I help you?

1305
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:35,911
You can help me by giving me

1306
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:37,640
three of your best
doggone suites, baby.

1307
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:40,649
Well, it'll be my pleasure
to assist you today.

1308
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:41,843
May I see some
identification, please?

1309
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,078
Okay.

1310
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:44,586
Right there.

1311
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,145
Go to hell, Louis.

1312
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:49,192
Mr. Henderson?

1313
00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:50,726
It is I.

1314
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,093
Will you excuse me for
just a minute, please?

1315
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:00,329
Okay.

1316
00:56:01,672 --> 00:56:03,765
Henderson.

1317
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,003
Ahh, I-I'm sorry, Mr.
Henderson, Henderson.

1318
00:56:07,077 --> 00:56:08,874
We're unable to
accommodate you.

1319
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:10,970
Perhaps we could
recommend another hotel.

1320
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:12,640
For what, man? I'm in Memphis.

1321
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:14,047
I want to stay at the Peabody.

1322
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:16,677
Yes, sir, I understand
you've stayed with us before,

1323
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,152
and apparently,
that's the problem.

1324
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:20,485
It seems that the last
time you stayed here...

1325
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:23,720
March 12, 1978, to be exact...

1326
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:26,763
you hosted a party,
during which the room

1327
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,695
and several other
areas of the hotel

1328
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:31,097
- sustained extensive
damage. - Uh-oh.

1329
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:33,329
I don't recollect
nothing like that.

1330
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,268
I think that's the
night Sly and Bootsy

1331
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:36,896
came by with the fire-eater.

1332
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:39,305
Is that the one
with the snake?

1333
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:41,310
- That's the one.
- Hmm.

1334
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:45,041
Perhaps you could put those
rooms in the name of Louis Hinds.

1335
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:46,377
Yeah, perhaps.

1336
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,475
Louis Hinds, we'll try that.

1337
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:57,893
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Linda.

1338
00:56:57,961 --> 00:56:59,690
What's on there?
Let me see that shit.

1339
00:56:59,763 --> 00:57:01,890
I want to see what's on there.

1340
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,763
I need four rooms, Don.

1341
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:06,769
Your best available.

1342
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,343
Oh, hey, guys.

1343
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,514
Your tailor gave me
several choices for tonight.

1344
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,558
He said he's going to
stop by around 7:30.

1345
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,683
What the fuck?

1346
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,455
Did you catch the sale
over at the Build-A-Pimp?

1347
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:33,689
You like that? It's fly, huh?

1348
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:36,392
It's a get-down, get-down.
It's live. It's funky.

1349
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:38,058
And I think I'm going
to get some poonanny.

1350
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:39,625
To be honest with you,

1351
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:42,069
<i>I haven't been laid since
Friends was on television.</i>

1352
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:43,401
So this is my night.

1353
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:46,033
You sure that ain't
one of your children?

1354
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:50,074
You gonna sing
real nice tonight.

1355
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:51,307
Who's the girl singer?

1356
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:58,243
Oh, my goodness!
Look at here! Oh, man.

1357
00:57:58,321 --> 00:57:59,447
Hello, Louis. Good to see you.

1358
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:00,615
You good, man?

1359
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:08,890
Hey, good-looking.

1360
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,456
Claudette. How
you doing, girl?

1361
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:13,093
I know you still ain't upset

1362
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:14,467
about what happened
in Baltimore that...

1363
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:16,563
Oh! What's wrong
with you, woman?

1364
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,040
You going straight to
hell, Floyd Henderson.

1365
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:21,839
What you laughing at?

1366
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:24,779
- You want some, too?
- No.

1367
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:25,815
Fuck you.

1368
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:27,440
Eee.

1369
00:58:27,517 --> 00:58:29,178
Fuck you, fuck you

1370
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:30,913
Now we have no girl singer.

1371
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,921
We just got to find a
replacement, that's all.

1372
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,149
It's too late.

1373
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:36,454
Cleo.

1374
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:38,323
You know all our songs, right?

1375
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:41,296
Ho ho ho. No offense, man,

1376
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:43,025
but I'm not playing
with no rank amateur.

1377
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:45,431
Come on, Wolfman, this
ain't no rank amateur, man.

1378
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,163
This Odetta Whitfield's
daughter, man.

1379
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:48,363
Ain't got to recognize.

1380
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:50,929
Shit. Let's roll, then, baby.

1381
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,599
Yeah.

1382
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:55,474
She can sing, can't she?

1383
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:58,236
Ow!

1384
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,915
Ow!

1385
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,587
Oh, oh!

1386
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:09,715
Here we go.

1387
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:12,489
Oh, yeah.

1388
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:19,200
If music makes you move

1389
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:21,635
You can really groove

1390
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:28,174
Groove on

1391
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:31,476
If you feel like
you want to make love

1392
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:34,278
Under the stars above

1393
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,285
Love on

1394
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:39,849
Love on

1395
00:59:41,491 --> 00:59:43,857
If there's something
that you wanna say

1396
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:46,953
And talking is the hard way

1397
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:53,895
Rap on

1398
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:57,201
'Cause whatever

1399
00:59:57,274 --> 00:59:58,969
You want to do

1400
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:02,478
- Ow
- You got to do your thing

1401
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,443
If you feel like
you want to scream

1402
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,621
If that's your way
you let off steam

1403
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:14,179
Scream on

1404
01:00:15,859 --> 01:00:18,293
Scream on

1405
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:22,554
If you feel like
you want to sing

1406
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:25,465
'Cause singing is your thing

1407
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:27,503
Sing on

1408
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:32,500
Sing on

1409
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:35,203
If you want to
make love all night

1410
01:00:35,278 --> 01:00:38,975
'Cause you feel it's right

1411
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:40,880
- Right on
- Oh, yeah, girl.

1412
01:00:40,951 --> 01:00:44,079
Right on

1413
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:48,090
'Cause whatever

1414
01:00:48,158 --> 01:00:51,093
You want to do

1415
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:53,152
You got to do your thing

1416
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:05,667
I'm with the band.
Yeah, it's a dream.

1417
01:01:05,742 --> 01:01:07,733
Yeah, it's a...
it's a total dream.

1418
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:08,903
Yeah.

1419
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:11,345
I play the harmuffica.

1420
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:15,510
Wa, wa

1421
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:16,847
I'll save you a seat.

1422
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,151
'Cause whatever

1423
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:23,420
You want to do

1424
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:27,862
Yeah, baby, oh

1425
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:33,596
You got to do your thing

1426
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,865
Yeah

1427
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:44,876
Yeah.

1428
01:01:52,956 --> 01:01:56,483
This is the most
insane night of my life.

1429
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,356
You know Isaac wants
to put me in his studio?

1430
01:01:58,428 --> 01:02:01,761
He says he's got a song
that'd be perfect for me.

1431
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:03,799
Oh, he does, does he?

1432
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:07,166
Uh... Come on, now.
It ain't like that.

1433
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh, it's always like that,

1434
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:10,562
like movies.

1435
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:14,509
Well, I'll be careful.

1436
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:17,307
Just trying to look
out for you, that's all.

1437
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:22,512
Thanks, guys, for everything.

1438
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:28,688
You got to do your thing, hey

1439
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,226
See you later.

1440
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:39,624
If you feel like making love

1441
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:42,193
'Cause that's your thing

1442
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:44,968
Right on

1443
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:47,441
Man, ain't that
the Real Deal car?

1444
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,637
Sure is, homie. You a fan?

1445
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:55,249
Hell, yeah. I'm a big fan.

1446
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:56,842
You know where they at?

1447
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,353
'Cause I need
to holler at 'em.

1448
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:01,857
Actually, I'm their manager.

1449
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:05,190
Really? Their manager?

1450
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,765
Hold on a minute.

1451
01:03:15,138 --> 01:03:17,163
- Oh, hi, Floyd.
- Hey.

1452
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,299
Come on in. Check
this place out.

1453
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:20,603
I could get used to this.

1454
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:22,042
I'll bet you could.

1455
01:03:22,112 --> 01:03:23,272
Let me get you a drink.

1456
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:24,472
Yeah, I'll take one.

1457
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:25,809
But hold on,
before you do that,

1458
01:03:25,882 --> 01:03:27,474
there's something I
want to say to you.

1459
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,450
It's been a blast
connecting with you.

1460
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:30,781
I want you to know that.

1461
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:32,287
That's sweet of you.

1462
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:33,617
And if you need anything,

1463
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:34,884
like money or
something like that,

1464
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,722
don't you hesitate
to call me now.

1465
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:39,853
Not that money gonna make up
for the lost time between us

1466
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:41,396
or nothing like that.

1467
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:42,726
Lost time?

1468
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:43,823
You have to understand,

1469
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,994
Odetta never told
me nothing about you.

1470
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,833
Had I known about you
from the beginning,

1471
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:50,167
- I'd have been here from the start.
- Whoa, whoa.

1472
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,502
- Floyd...
- She never said nothing to me about you.

1473
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:52,836
You're not my father, Floyd.

1474
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:54,342
You're not listening.

1475
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,002
See, the thing you...
what's that? Say what?

1476
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,637
You're not my father.

1477
01:03:57,714 --> 01:03:59,443
I
- I'm not?

1478
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:00,813
No.

1479
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:02,476
How do you know?

1480
01:04:02,552 --> 01:04:04,850
Because he knows who I am

1481
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:06,411
Or he did.

1482
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:07,751
I mean, for all I know,

1483
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:09,052
he could be dead.

1484
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:13,462
I get a little money from
him every once in a while.

1485
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:16,260
It's a blind trust
he set up years ago.

1486
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:18,459
Something to do with
his music royalties.

1487
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:21,265
Music royalties?

1488
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,037
Oh!

1489
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,009
You knocked up my
wife, motherfucker.

1490
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:31,205
Ooh. You stole
her from me first.

1491
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:33,146
What is wrong with you?

1492
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:34,740
Whoo!

1493
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,148
You lost your...

1494
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:37,652
You didn't tell Cleo, did you?

1495
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,153
No, I didn't tell her.

1496
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:40,553
I should've told her, though.

1497
01:04:40,623 --> 01:04:42,887
I'll bet you laughing
your ass off, wasn't you?

1498
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,426
Going around, talking
about I'm the girl's daddy

1499
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:47,327
and big round circle of
life, all that bullshit.

1500
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:48,830
Giggle, giggle, motherfucker.

1501
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:50,559
Well, just a little bit.

1502
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:53,833
Floyd...

1503
01:04:53,903 --> 01:04:55,666
Look, Floyd...

1504
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:56,932
Floyd, put it
down. Put it down!

1505
01:04:57,006 --> 01:04:59,600
Dawg, come on!

1506
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:01,268
You need to quit
before you get hurt.

1507
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:04,336
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

1508
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:05,438
Ugh!

1509
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:06,948
Look, Floyd,

1510
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:08,950
I didn't mean for it
to happen, all right?

1511
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:10,315
You know how she was.

1512
01:05:10,386 --> 01:05:13,716
Come here.

1513
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,348
Come on, man.
Stop acting a fool.

1514
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:17,817
You all right?

1515
01:05:17,894 --> 01:05:19,828
Aw, shit. Quit acting a fool!

1516
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:26,226
Fucking dad!

1517
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:28,862
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1518
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:53,257
Time out.

1519
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,923
Oh.

1520
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,465
Still got a little pop in
your punch there, partner.

1521
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:01,662
Pop this, motherfucker!

1522
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:03,501
Oh!

1523
01:06:03,573 --> 01:06:04,904
Ooh.

1524
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:06,908
Shit. Ugh.

1525
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:08,238
You dirty motherfucker,

1526
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:10,211
hitting me in the nuts.

1527
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,578
Ooh! Shit.

1528
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:16,517
Louis, you just can't
keep whooping on my ass.

1529
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:18,679
I'm a motherfucking man, baby.

1530
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:20,279
I'm a motherfucking man.

1531
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,487
Louis, how come you won't
see your own daughter?

1532
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:28,553
Oh, motherfucker,
I wanted to see her,

1533
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:31,122
but, you know...

1534
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,101
It's time... After a while,

1535
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:37,196
you know, it's just...
it's just too much.

1536
01:06:37,273 --> 01:06:39,036
Why didn't O tell her?

1537
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:40,700
Why didn't Odetta
tell her, man?

1538
01:06:40,777 --> 01:06:42,711
What was she going
to tell her, huh?

1539
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:46,476
That her daddy was a
alcoholic dopehead convict

1540
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:48,881
that fucked up everything
he touched, hmm?

1541
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:50,043
No, no.

1542
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:51,950
She was better off without me.

1543
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:53,488
Oh, shit.

1544
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:54,614
Anyhow, it's too late now.

1545
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:55,715
Uh-uh.

1546
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:58,283
It was a mistake
getting to know her.

1547
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,022
- Lou...
- What?

1548
01:07:00,096 --> 01:07:01,461
What is wrong with you?
You having a seizure?

1549
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:03,829
What? What?

1550
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,663
Oh.

1551
01:07:05,735 --> 01:07:07,669
Oh. Cleo.

1552
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:09,534
- Cleo, wait. Ow!
- Excuse me.

1553
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:11,573
God damn it. Wait!

1554
01:07:11,641 --> 01:07:13,131
Let me talk to... ow!

1555
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:14,506
Move, God damn it!

1556
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:16,204
Come here, Cleo!

1557
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:18,144
Call the police.

1558
01:07:20,283 --> 01:07:21,477
Hey, yo, white boy.

1559
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:23,576
You really in the
music business?

1560
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:24,745
Why, do you have a mix tape?

1561
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:26,311
Shut the fuck up, white boy!

1562
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:28,721
And stop sweating
so goddamn much.

1563
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:30,315
You smell like bacon.

1564
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:32,327
And I'm a Muslim on Saturdays.

1565
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:34,386
Fucking wrong with you, huh?

1566
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:36,591
How you white and got a afro?

1567
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,691
That ain't cool.

1568
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,030
Damn, my head hurt!

1569
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,435
Hey, there go
Cleo. There go Cleo.

1570
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:44,302
Taxi.

1571
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:45,898
There go my baby, right there.

1572
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:47,408
Where she going?

1573
01:07:47,477 --> 01:07:48,739
Where to, honey?

1574
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:50,108
Cleo!

1575
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:51,441
Oh, hell, yeah.

1576
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:54,950
There go that old Snoop
Dogg-looking motherfucker.

1577
01:07:55,017 --> 01:07:56,075
Real Deal,

1578
01:07:56,152 --> 01:07:58,620
they fitting to be real dead!

1579
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:00,315
I'm coming for you, old man!

1580
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:02,483
Hey, yo, Les, let them old
motherfuckers have it, man.

1581
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:03,889
- I'm going for it.
- Go for it, nigger.

1582
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,019
Get them motherfuckers.

1583
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:07,790
Hey, hey, hey.

1584
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:10,025
Come on, now. You know I'm the
only who drive the Mothership, man.

1585
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:11,566
Watch this shit with Lester

1586
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:12,896
about to kill on
these motherfuckers.

1587
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:14,561
That's how we live,
we do it like that.

1588
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:17,837
Louis!

1589
01:08:17,907 --> 01:08:19,932
I'm back!

1590
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:22,204
Gun!

1591
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:23,370
Yeah!

1592
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:30,112
Oh, shit! Motherfucking
Lester got fucked up!

1593
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:31,244
God damn!

1594
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:34,856
I'm out of this
motherfucker...

1595
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:36,186
- What about Lester, man?
- Fuck Lester.

1596
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:38,955
Yeah, fuck Lester!

1597
01:08:39,028 --> 01:08:42,589
You don't even
know Lester, man.

1598
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:47,060
Why you run over me, man!

1599
01:08:47,136 --> 01:08:51,129
You old dirty bastard!

1600
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:55,475
Old Jim Brown,
Fred Williamson,

1601
01:08:55,545 --> 01:08:58,207
two-the-hard-way
motherfuckers!

1602
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:00,408
I'll kill you, I swear...

1603
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:03,008
Aah! Shit!

1604
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:06,577
Let me kill you one
time at least, man!

1605
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:08,021
You done fucked
up the Mothership.

1606
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,216
I ought to stab
you in your throat.

1607
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:10,418
Fuck you! Aah!

1608
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:12,256
You hear that?

1609
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:14,694
Shoot that
motherfucker, Louis.

1610
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:19,062
Get your hands up!

1611
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:21,933
I can't, nigger.
My arm's in a brace.

1612
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:24,768
Drop the weapon now! Come on!

1613
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:32,176
This is my first time
ever being in here.

1614
01:09:32,248 --> 01:09:33,647
Quiet, please.

1615
01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:41,318
This filthy-ass
motherfucking place,

1616
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,948
man, got me itching.

1617
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,592
Yo, turnkey!

1618
01:09:46,662 --> 01:09:48,357
Come on and let me out
of this motherfucker!

1619
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:50,695
You might want to wrap
your mind around the fact

1620
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:51,892
that we're gonna
miss that show.

1621
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:53,697
Fuck you talking about, man?

1622
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:56,397
We gotta be in New
York tomorrow night.

1623
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:58,235
Uh-uh. Not me.

1624
01:09:58,307 --> 01:09:59,535
I've had enough. I'm done.

1625
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:01,634
What, you're walking
out on me, Louis?

1626
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,009
Look, Floyd, I
was doing just fine

1627
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,377
before you showed
up at my door.

1628
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:06,745
That's the thanks I get

1629
01:10:06,816 --> 01:10:08,283
for pulling you out of
that fucking rat hole.

1630
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:09,613
You was just
sitting up in there,

1631
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:10,879
just sitting there
waiting to die.

1632
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:12,079
Negro, please.

1633
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:13,746
You ain't no
different from me,

1634
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:16,451
Especially since your nephew put
your senile ass out to pasture

1635
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:17,686
and stole your business.

1636
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,591
Fuck you, Louis.

1637
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:22,722
Crawl back under that damn
rock you've been living.

1638
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:24,322
I don't need you.

1639
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,425
I'll do this shit
by my damn self.

1640
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,994
Yo! Turnkey!

1641
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,835
Come on and let me out
of this motherfucker.

1642
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:33,671
I've had enough,
man. I want my lawyer.

1643
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:34,767
Relax, relax.

1644
01:10:34,844 --> 01:10:36,778
You ain't gonna
need no lawyer.

1645
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:38,973
Witnesses say your
story checks out,

1646
01:10:39,048 --> 01:10:41,778
so you, sir, are good to go.

1647
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:45,252
Yeah.

1648
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:47,789
Whoa. Hold on
there, Chuck Berry.

1649
01:10:47,857 --> 01:10:50,087
You're gonna need a lawyer.

1650
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,890
Seems crossing state lines
is in violation of his parole,

1651
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:55,931
Not to mention
possession of firearms

1652
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:57,295
and driving without a license.

1653
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:58,424
No license?

1654
01:10:59,669 --> 01:11:00,931
Step back for a minute.

1655
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,105
I hope your ass
rot up in here,

1656
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:07,142
you criminal-bound
motherfucker, you.

1657
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:12,374
As Lao-Tzu says, "Let things
flow forward as they may. "

1658
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:14,780
And I'm gonna let
it flow, too, baby.

1659
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:19,048
And I got some Blackanese
philosophical shit for your ass, pal.

1660
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,612
You get by, Lou, but
you don't get away.

1661
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:23,955
You sit in shit, you
start to smell like it,

1662
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:25,584
so check the
crack of your ass.

1663
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:27,822
Here's something else for you.

1664
01:11:27,897 --> 01:11:30,024
Here go her number.

1665
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:33,592
Call her... Daddy.

1666
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:36,499
Fuck him, man!

1667
01:11:36,572 --> 01:11:38,335
Let's get on out of
this motherfucker.

1668
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:40,739
He ain't worth two
damn flies smashed.

1669
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:44,137
Nigger.

1670
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:52,679
Hmph!

1671
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,130
Hey. Yo!

1672
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:07,902
Can I make a phone call?

1673
01:12:23,653 --> 01:12:25,848
<i>You walking out on me, Louis?</i>

1674
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:27,286
<i>I've had enough. I'm done.</i>

1675
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:28,823
<i>You all right, man?</i>

1676
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,381
<i>Um, yeah, yeah. I'm all right.</i>

1677
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,017
<i>You're not all right.
You can't hardly breathe.</i>

1678
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,994
<i>You need a chest X-ray.</i>

1679
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:36,258
<i>I ain't trying to
make no comeback.</i>

1680
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:37,924
<i>I'm gone, and I
want to stay gone.</i>

1681
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,297
<i>That's the thanks I get</i>

1682
01:12:39,368 --> 01:12:40,630
<i>for pulling you out
of that rat hole,</i>

1683
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,829
<i>just sitting there
waiting to die...</i>

1684
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:43,496
<i>sitting there
waiting to die...</i>

1685
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:45,130
<i>- die, die...
- It's too late.</i>

1686
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:46,868
<i>Is there a doctor
in the house?</i>

1687
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:51,244
<i>Keep it short.</i>

1688
01:12:51,313 --> 01:12:52,746
<i>- Hey...
- Hello.</i>

1689
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:55,545
<i>It's Cleo. Please
leave a message.</i>

1690
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:03,022
Cleo... um, this
is, uh, Louis.

1691
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:04,992
Louis Hinds.

1692
01:13:05,061 --> 01:13:06,426
Your father.

1693
01:13:07,697 --> 01:13:10,564
Wow, um, feels
funny saying that.

1694
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,794
I've, um, I've
never said it before.

1695
01:13:12,868 --> 01:13:14,597
Um...

1696
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,137
Listen.

1697
01:13:18,174 --> 01:13:20,369
I didn't mean what I said.

1698
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:21,808
I was...

1699
01:13:24,814 --> 01:13:28,250
Odetta was the
love of my life.

1700
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:30,114
The worst thing that
ever happened to me

1701
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:33,917
was losing her and you.

1702
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,320
But you turned out great.

1703
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:38,656
She did a wonderful
job with you.

1704
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:41,492
You know your mother
was an amazing woman.

1705
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,088
And I just want you to know

1706
01:13:43,165 --> 01:13:48,228
I'm really, really
glad I met you.

1707
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:49,396
And I wish I...

1708
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:56,037
Yo.

1709
01:13:59,582 --> 01:14:00,981
All right.

1710
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:12,222
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1711
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:13,226
Hmm?

1712
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:14,785
Busting your ass out of jail.

1713
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:17,094
What the fuck does it
look like I'm doing?

1714
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,497
Back up, Red.
Get your keys out.

1715
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:19,556
Open that cell, okay?

1716
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:20,761
Deputy, don't listen to him.

1717
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,202
He will not shoot you.
Not on purpose anyway.

1718
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:25,740
Don't let him get
you fucked up, Red.

1719
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:27,241
I'll kill you disco-dead.

1720
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:29,539
Now open that
doggone cell, man.

1721
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:31,842
Stop shaking. If you shake,
I'm gonna start shaking.

1722
01:14:31,914 --> 01:14:33,211
Next thing you know, kapow!

1723
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:34,510
Go on in.

1724
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:35,641
Now hand him the keys.

1725
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:37,413
Hand them to him.

1726
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:38,919
- Okay?
- Floyd.

1727
01:14:38,988 --> 01:14:40,649
You sure you want to do this?

1728
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:43,191
Does everything gotta be a
fucking argument with you?

1729
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:44,624
God damn! Come
on out of there!

1730
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,593
Close the door,
Lou. Lock it up.

1731
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:48,994
I'm a hostage.

1732
01:14:49,064 --> 01:14:50,463
You're gonna be a dead hostage

1733
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:51,659
if you don't shut the fuck up.

1734
01:14:53,169 --> 01:14:54,830
Now look here, Red.

1735
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:56,462
I like you, almost.

1736
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:59,440
You call anybody
outside your mama, kapow.

1737
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:00,998
Okay?

1738
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:03,175
Let's get out of here.

1739
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,046
Anybody following us, man?

1740
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:08,174
Not yet.

1741
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,684
But you can bet your
ass they will be.

1742
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:11,947
Lou, we gotta dump
the Mothership, man.

1743
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:13,181
We gotta dump it.

1744
01:15:13,255 --> 01:15:14,722
You'd abandon the Mothership?

1745
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,155
We're fugitives from the law.

1746
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,159
We gotta start
thinking like it.

1747
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:20,525
We're not fugitives, O.J.

1748
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:22,860
You're a fugitive.
I'm a hostage.

1749
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:24,729
That's my story, and
I'm sticking to it.

1750
01:15:29,572 --> 01:15:30,630
Wait, wait, wait.

1751
01:15:30,706 --> 01:15:32,230
Hold, hold, hold,
hold, hold, hold.

1752
01:15:32,308 --> 01:15:34,333
Look at that right there, man.

1753
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,674
Ain't that Lester's car?

1754
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,679
Motherfuckers.

1755
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:47,416
We're hungry, man. Come up with
some baked chicken or something.

1756
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:54,362
They're at it again.

1757
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:01,092
Oh, shit! Lester's car!

1758
01:16:11,146 --> 01:16:13,046
- You hear that?
- What?

1759
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,342
That.

1760
01:16:16,418 --> 01:16:20,582
Oh, my God! Oh,
God, no! Oh, God...

1761
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,951
Mr. Hinds. Mr. Henderson.

1762
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,186
It's so good to see you.

1763
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:26,728
Oh, my God.

1764
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:30,231
Oh, it was so hot in
there. You have no idea.

1765
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:32,290
If there's anything
I can get you,

1766
01:16:32,368 --> 01:16:34,427
like a latte, I'm
here for you guys.

1767
01:16:34,503 --> 01:16:35,834
But first I
really have to pee,

1768
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:37,270
so I'm just gonna hop on out.

1769
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:39,239
If you could give me
a hand out of here.

1770
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,468
I've been locked in there,

1771
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,339
and they've had the
woofers going all day.

1772
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,969
Oh, my God.

1773
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,412
I just have to pee real
bad, so if you don't mind.

1774
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:47,540
It's so good to see you.

1775
01:16:47,616 --> 01:16:49,447
Oh, Mr. Hinds...

1776
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,991
Ahh...

1777
01:17:01,964 --> 01:17:03,192

01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:38,957
Uh, that's my other line.

1799
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,592
I'll call you
back. This is Danny.

1800
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:41,761
Hello, Mr. Epstein.

1801
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:44,499
<i>Phillip Newman. I broke
your stapler last week.</i>

1802
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:45,972
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- Hello?</i>

1803
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,269
Where the hell are you?

1804
01:17:47,343 --> 01:17:49,140
Listen, I called because I
just wanted to let you know

1805
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,679
that everything's cool,
and we're still on target.

1806
01:17:51,747 --> 01:17:52,975
We?

1807
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:54,709
You're with
Henderson and Hinds?

1808
01:17:54,783 --> 01:17:55,807
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1809
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,374
They say "motherfucker" a lot,

1810
01:17:57,453 --> 01:17:58,715
but they're really good guys.

1811
01:17:58,787 --> 01:18:00,277
All right, well, good.

1812
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:01,687
You can give
them this message.

1813
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:03,486
The network just called,
and they're off the show.

1814
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:05,186
But they can't do that!

1815
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,989
Oh, really? It's VH1.

1816
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:08,495
<i>Have you seen Flava of Love?</i>

1817
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:10,464
They can pretty much
do whatever they want.

1818
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:12,727
And another thing,
you're fired.

1819
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,827
Motherfucker! What the fuck?

1820
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:25,343
What'd he say?

1821
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:29,512
Uh, he said I'm fired,

1822
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:34,045
and... and, uh, and
you're off the show.

1823
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:42,792
Are... Are you serious, man?

1824
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,725
I'm so sorry.

1825
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:06,011
Nnn! Nnn! Nnn!

1826
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:32,640
You know, uh,
according to the map,

1827
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:35,911
that road leads
to the turnpike.

1828
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:37,611
I think we've still
got time to make it.

1829
01:19:37,686 --> 01:19:40,246
Make what, Louis?

1830
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:42,187
You heard what the
motherfucker said!

1831
01:19:42,257 --> 01:19:43,315
It's over!

1832
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:44,825
Fuck that.

1833
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:53,264
This shit ain't over till
we say it's over, all right?

1834
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:56,936
Things have changed,

1835
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:01,066
and I have achieved a
state of mental clarity.

1836
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:02,371
Ain't that a bitch?

1837
01:20:02,444 --> 01:20:03,672
You hear what this
motherfucker said?

1838
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:06,543
Ever since I knocked
on your door, man,

1839
01:20:06,615 --> 01:20:08,810
you've been beating my
balls at every fucking turn.

1840
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:12,547
Now all of a sudden, you've
got a state of clarity.

1841
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:14,350
Where was your
clarity in L.A., Lou?

1842
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:15,913
You can't just
dial that shit up

1843
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:18,255
like you calling for
a pizza, motherfucker.

1844
01:20:18,327 --> 01:20:21,160
You got to go
inside, do the work.

1845
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,824
Consequently, I
have a confession.

1846
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:29,601
Floyd, you were
right about me.

1847
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:33,664
I have given up on a
lot of things in my life.

1848
01:20:33,742 --> 01:20:36,210
But I ain't giving
up on this. All right?

1849
01:20:36,278 --> 01:20:40,078
Come on, man, we've been through
enough shit the last few days.

1850
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:41,548
We can do this.

1851
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:44,347
And I dare anybody
to try to stop us.

1852
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:46,387
Let's go, motherfucker.

1853
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:47,581
Shotgun.

1854
01:20:48,924 --> 01:20:50,448
Get your ass in the backseat.

1855
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:53,525
<i>Ain't no stoppin' us now</i>

1856

<i>We're on the move</i>

1857
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:02,637
<i>There's been so many
things that's held us down</i>

1858
01:21:02,704 --> 01:21:04,535
<i>But now it looks</i>

1859
01:21:04,606 --> 01:21:07,439
<i>Like things are
finally coming around</i>

1860
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:12,746
<i>Don't you let nothing, nothing</i>

1861
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:16,807
<i>Stand in your way</i>

1862
01:21:16,885 --> 01:21:20,685
<i>I want y'all to listen, listen</i>

1863
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:24,283
<i>To every word I
say, every word I say</i>

1864
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:26,827
<i>Ain't no stopping us now</i>

1865
01:21:26,895 --> 01:21:28,260
<i>No, no, no</i>

1866
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,797
<i>We're on the move</i>

1867
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:33,130
<i>The movin' groovin'</i>

1868
01:21:33,202 --> 01:21:35,568
<i>Ain't no stopping us now</i>

1869
01:21:35,637 --> 01:21:37,571
Full sound and switch on all
the floor monitors, all right?

1870
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:39,800
Look at that. That's
nice and subtle.

1871
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:41,001
I'm on it, then. Sound check.

1872
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:42,043
Okay. Thanks.

1873
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:43,042
- Mr. Epstein.
- Yeah?

1874
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:44,408
Hey, thank God you're here.

1875
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:45,639
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

1876
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:47,545
What are you doing here?
I thought I fired you.

1877
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:49,777
I just wanted to tell
you I'm not alone.

1878
01:21:56,024 --> 01:21:57,389
You guys are insane!

1879
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:59,086
Good to see you,
too, Little Ep.

1880
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:01,254
Yeah, this is never
going to happen.

1881
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:04,026
You'll be arrested the
moment the cops spot you.

1882
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:05,896
We don't care
anything about that.

1883
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:07,902
We just want to do our song.

1884
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,200
Oh, one other thing.
You got a few minutes?

1885
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:11,739
Yeah, I got all the
time in the world.

1886
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:13,434
I'm just producing
a television show

1887
01:22:13,508 --> 01:22:15,135
with dozens of
huge musical acts

1888
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:17,337
that goes live
in 171/2 minutes,

1889
01:22:17,412 --> 01:22:19,346
but you know, let's grab some
coffee and have a little chit-chat.

1890
01:22:25,087 --> 01:22:27,453
Wow. How long's he got?

1891
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:30,416
We don't know.

1892
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:33,450
All right.

1893
01:22:33,528 --> 01:22:35,587
I'll see what I can do. Okay?

1894
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:37,256
Thank you.

1895
01:22:40,535 --> 01:22:43,595
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1896
01:22:43,672 --> 01:22:45,663

1897
01:22:45,741 --> 01:22:48,005
<i>The ceremony will
begin shortly.</i>

1898
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:54,181
I'll get it.

1899
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,512
Wow!

1900
01:22:59,588 --> 01:23:01,055
The Black Moses.

1901
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:03,157
How's it going, man?

1902
01:23:03,225 --> 01:23:04,317
Hey, what's happening?

1903
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:05,325
What's up, baby?

1904
01:23:05,394 --> 01:23:06,326
Hey, fellas.

1905
01:23:06,395 --> 01:23:07,726
Hey, what's happening?

1906
01:23:07,796 --> 01:23:09,229
- The man.
- My man.

1907
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:10,424
Okay, all right.

1908
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:12,694
Heard you were here. Just
wanted to wish you luck.

1909
01:23:13,835 --> 01:23:14,824
Oh, by the way,

1910
01:23:14,903 --> 01:23:16,495
brought somebody
by to see you.

1911
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:17,629
Oh, is that right?

1912
01:23:17,706 --> 01:23:19,003
Yeah.

1913
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,306
Okay, everybody, let's
move on out of here.

1914
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:29,611
Come on.

1915
01:23:29,685 --> 01:23:31,550
All right, you heard
what Mr. Henderson said.

1916
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,552
After you, young man.

1917
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:34,350
Okay.

1918
01:23:53,942 --> 01:23:57,002
I'm sorry I ran
out the way I did.

1919
01:23:58,213 --> 01:24:00,545
I'm the one who ran out.

1920
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:02,742
There's no need for
you to apologize.

1921
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,487
Can I help you with your tie?

1922
01:24:10,559 --> 01:24:11,856
Yeah, sure.

1923
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:13,952
You know what you're doing?

1924
01:24:14,029 --> 01:24:15,860
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1925
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:19,026
Here you go.

1926
01:24:21,136 --> 01:24:22,967
Mm! Ohh!

1927
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:25,834
You all right?

1928
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:27,704
Yeah. Just some water, please.

1929
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,743
Damn!

1930
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,107
All cameras are on point.

1931
01:24:30,178 --> 01:24:31,372
We just added two mics.

1932
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:33,107
Mr. Epstein! You
better come quick.

1933
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,773
Come on, I'm serious.
Come on! It's important!

1934
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:36,010
All right. Take care of those.

1935
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:37,108
15 minutes, Danny.

1936
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:41,047
He just collapsed.

1937
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:42,852
I think he's in a lot of pain.

1938
01:24:42,924 --> 01:24:44,391
Open your hand.
Open your hand.

1939
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:45,517
Right there, right there.

1940
01:24:45,594 --> 01:24:47,960
Okay, okay.

1941
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:51,463
Be strong, brother.
Hang on in there.

1942
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:53,398
It ain't time for
you to check out now.

1943
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:54,730
Check out? What?

1944
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:57,135
Come on, man.
Everybody knows, man.

1945
01:24:57,205 --> 01:24:59,537
My aunt was taking the
same doggone pills, man.

1946
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:02,270
Took her about a week before
she wasted away to nothing,

1947
01:25:02,344 --> 01:25:03,538
just kicking and screaming.

1948
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:04,977
I don't know what
killed her ass,

1949
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:08,345
but if she was taking those,
she had a bladder infection.

1950
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:09,543
Say what?

1951
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:12,781
Look, Doctor Dumbshit,
I got a kidney stone.

1952
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:14,344
Hurts like a
motherfucker when I pee,

1953
01:25:14,423 --> 01:25:15,685
but it ain't gonna kill me.

1954
01:25:15,757 --> 01:25:16,951
So you're not dying?

1955
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:20,392
From the first slap and
cry, we all start to die.

1956
01:25:20,462 --> 01:25:23,124
But I ain't on no
accelerated program, hell, no.

1957
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:25,393
Ain't that about a bitch?

1958
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:28,334
All that damn hard work,
busting your ass out of jail,

1959
01:25:28,403 --> 01:25:29,563
and you ain't even dying.

1960
01:25:29,638 --> 01:25:31,003
I was kinda looking
forward to seeing you go.

1961
01:25:31,072 --> 01:25:33,267
Excuse me, Danny.
They're on in two.

1962
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:34,933
All right. Where we at, guys?

1963
01:25:36,144 --> 01:25:37,839
Okay, I'm good.

1964
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,308
The Apollo, the mecca.

1965
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:44,784
This brings back
memories, man.

1966
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:46,480
How many times you think
we've performed here?

1967
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:47,749
Ooh, uh...

1968
01:25:47,823 --> 01:25:49,120
ooh, five-oh.

1969
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,158
50, really?

1970
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:51,590
- Five-oh.
- Oh!

1971
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,820
Come on. Move, move.

1972
01:25:52,894 --> 01:25:54,657
That's them! Hold it! Hold it!

1973
01:25:54,729 --> 01:25:56,993
<i>All units report,
all units report.</i>

1974
01:25:57,065 --> 01:25:58,464
<i>Suspects have been spotted.</i>

1975
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:01,502
<i>All units, apprehend them
quietly and by the book.</i>

1976
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:04,839
Hey, Lou, do you think
they're gone, man?

1977
01:26:04,906 --> 01:26:06,430
I don't have X-ray
vision, motherfucker!

1978
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:07,532
How would I know?

1979
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:09,839
Lower your voice,
Lou. Doggone it, man.

1980
01:26:09,911 --> 01:26:11,742
It's so dark in here
you can't see shit.

1981
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:13,041
Hold up.

1982
01:26:13,114 --> 01:26:14,547
Let me see if I can
reach my lighter.

1983
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:15,742
Don't light no lighter
up in here, man.

1984
01:26:15,817 --> 01:26:17,307
We'll blow up like a barbecue.

1985
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:18,977
Hold on one minute.

1986
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:20,749
Shit.

1987
01:26:24,493 --> 01:26:27,519
Marcus motherfucking Hooks.

1988
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,996
Long way from Linwood
Street, huh, motherfucker?

1989
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:32,397
Fuck Linwood Street and him.

1990
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:34,401
He used both of
us, and you know it.

1991
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:37,063
Come on, man. He just thought
he'd be a bigger star going solo.

1992
01:26:37,138 --> 01:26:38,127
He was right.

1993
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:39,468
No he wasn't.

1994
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:41,202
He didn't want to split
the money three ways.

1995
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:42,402
Just look at
him, sitting there

1996
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:44,536
with that old shit-eating
grin on his face.

1997
01:26:44,613 --> 01:26:47,104
You think you're all that,
motherfucker, don't you?

1998
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:49,013
I have to admit, every
time I think about you,

1999
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,348
I could just choke
the shit out of you!

2000
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:52,545
Stop it, stop it!

2001
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:54,452
Floyd, he ain't
thinking shit. He's dead.

2002
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:00,152
Say, ain't that my watch?

2003
01:27:00,228 --> 01:27:02,219
See? You thought I
stole that mother...

2004
01:27:02,297 --> 01:27:04,322
I told you this
motherfucker was a klepto!

2005
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:05,764
Shit, look at that.

2006
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:07,199
That's nice.

2007
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:08,361
Probably stole that, too.

2008
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:10,700
Motherfucker always
had good taste, though.

2009
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:12,103
I'm gonna keep this.

2010
01:27:16,745 --> 01:27:18,576
Hey, Louis.

2011
01:27:18,647 --> 01:27:20,842
You think if, you know...

2012
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,884
if he wouldn't
have, you know, died,

2013
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,248
you think we would
have got back together?

2014
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:25,911
Oh, hell, no.

2015
01:27:25,987 --> 01:27:27,818
But you know what?

2016
01:27:27,889 --> 01:27:28,947
We are together,

2017
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,083
and I've been thinking
about our little arrangement.

2018
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:32,148
I'm gonna go ahead

2019
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:35,355
and break you off
50/50, all right?

2020
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:37,022
Wow, Lou, that's...

2021
01:27:37,098 --> 01:27:39,760
that's real black of you, man.

2022
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:41,461
Because there ain't no money.

2023
01:27:41,536 --> 01:27:42,560
Say what?

2024
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:44,605
Well, you said it yourself.

2025
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:45,662
It's a funeral.

2026
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,900
Nobody pays you to sing, man.

2027
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,374
You lied about the money?

2028
01:27:48,443 --> 01:27:50,377
- Yeah.
- You motherfucker.

2029
01:27:50,445 --> 01:27:52,310
Hey, you can't say
it wasn't worth it.

2030
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,245
Well, I could say it.

2031
01:27:56,117 --> 01:27:57,914
But I'd be lying.

2032
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,647
I love you, Lou.

2033
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:01,814
My nigger.

2034
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:03,915
But this motherfucker,
you know, I can't help it.

2035
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:06,085
Every time, I could just
kill this motherfucker!

2036
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:08,129
That's why he left, because
you was always picking on him.

2037
01:28:08,196 --> 01:28:09,254
Stop fucking with him.

2038
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:11,231
He fucked with my happiness.

2039
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:21,870
Ladies and gentlemen,

2040
01:28:21,943 --> 01:28:24,411
I'm Isaac Hayes.

2041
01:28:26,247 --> 01:28:28,238
Where the fuck
are they, Danny?

2042
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:31,342
My good friends,
please join me

2043
01:28:31,419 --> 01:28:35,185
in saying farewell to
brother Marcus Hooks.

2044
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:42,561
It's Louis and Floyd!

2045
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:43,757
It's the Real Deal!

2046
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:46,824
Oh!

2047
01:28:46,901 --> 01:28:49,699
Marcus Hooks and
the Real Deal,

2048
01:28:49,771 --> 01:28:51,500
back together again.

2049
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:54,502
Give them a hand.

2050
01:28:54,576 --> 01:28:57,477
Reunited, y'all.

2051
01:28:57,545 --> 01:28:58,944
They got their shit together.

2052
01:28:59,014 --> 01:29:01,847
Yes! Let's go!

2053
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,747
Stand by. Move
in on my command.

2054
01:29:03,818 --> 01:29:05,285
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2055
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:07,014
Come on, Officer
detective person.

2056
01:29:07,088 --> 01:29:08,350
Please, just,
you know, come on.

2057
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:10,288
Let them sing one
song. One little song.

2058
01:29:10,358 --> 01:29:12,019
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

2059
01:29:12,093 --> 01:29:13,720
The Real Deal!

2060
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:19,057
All right. One song.

2061
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:21,034
But it better be good.

2062
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:25,062
One song. The good one.

2063
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:30,804
How's that hip?

2064
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:31,971
Locked and loaded, baby.

2065
01:29:32,047 --> 01:29:33,309
Let's do this.

2066
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,444
Band!

2067
01:29:36,518 --> 01:29:38,509
Let's take a walk in the park.

2068
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:40,884
1, 2, 3, 4!

2069
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:54,595
Oh, yeah

2070
01:29:54,669 --> 01:29:57,035
When the river gets to rollin'

2071
01:29:57,105 --> 01:30:00,734
And then you add a
bowlful of soul in

2072
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:04,074
And then I tried to
let it all go then

2073
01:30:04,145 --> 01:30:05,806
Oh, yeah

2074
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,007
Oh, it's easy to me

2075
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:11,450
You see, the way
I ride the rhythm

2076
01:30:11,519 --> 01:30:15,080
You see, the truth
is all I can give 'em

2077
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:17,852
And the lyrics can
come from livin'

2078
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:21,623
Oh, yeah, oh, it's easy to me

2079
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:23,391
Oh, yeah

2080
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:27,424
Music comes out of my heart

2081
01:30:27,502 --> 01:30:31,461
Something like a
walking the park

2082
01:30:31,539 --> 01:30:34,599
It's just a walk in the park

2083
01:30:34,676 --> 01:30:36,473
Oh, yeah

2084
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:39,274
And no one else
in here, I heard it

2085
01:30:39,347 --> 01:30:42,976
I don't know what
I've done to deserve it

2086
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:46,646
You don't question
it while you serve it

2087
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:47,983
Oh, yeah

2088
01:30:48,056 --> 01:30:50,047
Oh, it was given to me

2089
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:53,652
I got something you inherit

2090
01:30:53,728 --> 01:30:56,754
I don't know that you
was born to share it

2091
01:30:56,831 --> 01:31:00,767
And if you shoot,
be sure you wear it

2092
01:31:00,835 --> 01:31:02,769
Oh, yeah

2093
01:31:02,837 --> 01:31:04,168
Oh, it comes naturally to me

2094
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,469
Uh-huh-uh

2095
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,634
Music comes out of my heart

2096
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:10,177
Yeah

2097
01:31:10,245 --> 01:31:13,840
Something like a
walk in the park

2098
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:15,906
It's just a walk in the park

2099
01:31:15,984 --> 01:31:18,849
Oh, yeah

2100
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,650
Oh, yeah!

2101
01:31:21,723 --> 01:31:23,782
Y'all having a good
time out here tonight?

2102
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:25,883
This is what I'm
talking about!

2103
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,121
You know about that
walk in the park, man?

2104
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:29,686
Sure I know about
that walk in the park.

2105
01:31:29,764 --> 01:31:31,254
You do? I'll tell you what.

2106
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:33,095
- Show them.
- Got to get down.

2107
01:31:40,909 --> 01:31:42,103
Ladies and gentlemen,

2108
01:31:42,177 --> 01:31:44,168
let's give a big
Apollo welcome

2109
01:31:44,245 --> 01:31:46,145
to the stage for
the first time,

2110
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:50,344
my daughter, Miss
Cleo Whitfield!

2111
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:54,013
To make something
out of nothin'

2112
01:31:54,088 --> 01:31:57,524
That's what we
all got in common

2113
01:31:57,592 --> 01:32:01,119
So just hold on
tight, I'm comin'

2114
01:32:01,196 --> 01:32:03,130
Oh, yeah, yeah

2115
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:04,631
Said to me

2116
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:07,862
I'll give you something
you can believe in

2117
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:11,702
And then enjoy
yourself this evenin'

2118
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:15,004
And don't you dare
think about leavin'

2119
01:32:15,076 --> 01:32:16,873
Oh, yeah

2120
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:20,779
Sing along with me

2121
01:32:20,849 --> 01:32:24,376
Music comes out of my heart

2122
01:32:24,452 --> 01:32:26,852
Something like a
walk in the park

2123
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:30,181
It's just a walk in the park

2124
01:32:30,258 --> 01:32:31,850
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

2125
01:32:31,926 --> 01:32:33,518
Oh, yeah

2126
01:32:35,029 --> 01:32:37,862
Music comes out of my heart

2127
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:42,301
Something like a
walk in the park

2128
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:45,168
It's just a walk in the park

2129
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,504
Oh, yeah

2130
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:51,973
Music comes out of my heart

2131
01:32:52,046 --> 01:32:53,479
One song.

2132
01:32:53,548 --> 01:32:55,641
Something like a
walk in the park

2133
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:57,014
A walk in the park

2134
01:32:57,085 --> 01:32:59,053
It's just a walk in the park

2135
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,382
A walk in the park

2136
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:02,423
Oh, yeah

2137
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:05,015
Music comes out of my heart

2138
01:33:05,093 --> 01:33:07,152
I'm their manager!

2139
01:33:07,228 --> 01:33:09,321
Something like a
walk in the park

2140
01:33:09,397 --> 01:33:11,160
Walk in the park

2141
01:33:11,232 --> 01:33:12,426
It's just a walk in the park

2142
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:18,564
Just like a walk in the park

2143
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:24,039
Oh, yeah

2144
01:33:38,459 --> 01:33:39,721
Whoo!

2145
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,403
<i>Yeah, ooh, yeah</i>

2146
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,128
Doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo

2147
01:34:14,195 --> 01:34:15,253
Haah

2148
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:17,025
You're gonna sing
real nice tonight.

2149
01:34:19,133 --> 01:34:20,191
<i>All right, y'all.</i>

2150
01:34:20,268 --> 01:34:22,964
<i>Got that funky time</i>

2151
01:34:23,037 --> 01:34:31,642
<i>I can feel it</i>

2152
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:35,647
Any time the camera
or the mic comes on,

2153
01:34:35,717 --> 01:34:37,150
I don't cheat myself.

2154
01:34:37,218 --> 01:34:39,618
That was rule number 1
I was taught as a kid.

2155
01:34:39,687 --> 01:34:41,484
And I definitely can't
cheat the audience.

2156
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:43,353
So I give 150%% %

2157
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:46,518
every single time
that I do anything.

2158
01:34:46,594 --> 01:34:48,357
Even the way I live my life.

2159
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:51,296
I just cherish
each doggone moment.

2160
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:53,891
A black preacher's
something else, ain't it?

2161
01:34:53,968 --> 01:34:56,994
You can't pay your rent
after you come from church.

2162
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,974
And if you ask the
preacher for the $5.00,

2163
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:04,034
he'll be like, "Fuck you
in the name of Jesus. "

2164
01:35:04,112 --> 01:35:06,876
My comedy is not fictitious.

2165
01:35:06,948 --> 01:35:10,213
My comedy has to
come from my heart.

2166
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,616
- Charlie Chan was a hell of a man.
- All right, let's rehearse.

2167
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:18,215
He went through China
with his shit in his hand.

2168
01:35:18,292 --> 01:35:20,783
Had five women
against the wall.

2169
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:23,592
I betcha five dollars
that he fucked them all.

2170
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:24,961
He fucked them hard.

2171
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:26,159
He fucked them long.

2172
01:35:26,234 --> 01:35:28,794
He fucked them till
his shit got sore.

2173
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:31,338
He went to the doctor,
and the doctor said,

2174
01:35:31,406 --> 01:35:33,738
"Sorry, Charlie,
your dick is dead. "

2175
01:35:33,808 --> 01:35:36,641
He said, "Doctor, Doctor,
that can't be true. "

2176
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:39,339
"Yes, sir, Charlie,
your balls are too!"

2177
01:35:41,182 --> 01:35:42,945
I've been performing
all my life.

2178
01:35:43,017 --> 01:35:44,678
So being in front
of an audience

2179
01:35:44,752 --> 01:35:46,379
has never been
a problem for me.

2180
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:48,285
It's time to go?

2181
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:50,588
Well, go on, then.

2182
01:35:53,494 --> 01:35:56,258
You want to leave a lasting
impression on your audience.

2183
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,890
You know, and that's
something I was taught, too,

2184
01:35:58,966 --> 01:36:00,263
when I first started.

2185
01:36:00,334 --> 01:36:01,562
Always make them remember you,

2186
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:04,434
or remember something
about you and the film.

2187
01:36:04,505 --> 01:36:08,134
I'm going back to my
$600-a-night hotel room,

2188
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:13,146
have me a nice-ass, uh,
piece of pussy and shit.

2189
01:36:13,214 --> 01:36:14,272
Okay?

2190
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:16,407
Cut it.

2191
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:19,278
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.

2192
01:36:19,353 --> 01:36:21,378
I'm not even in yet.

2193
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:25,592
I got to boogie for you

2194
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,924
I got nothin' but boogie

2195
01:36:27,995 --> 01:36:30,293
Nothin' but boogie for you

2196
01:36:30,364 --> 01:36:32,264
I got nothin' but boogie

2197
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:33,960
Nothin' but boogie for you

2198
01:36:34,035 --> 01:36:41,574
Boogie, boogie

2199
01:36:44,745 --> 01:36:47,475
I want to say
thanks to you all

2200
01:36:47,548 --> 01:36:51,279
because you all
made me... yeah.

2201
01:36:55,456 --> 01:36:58,254
I wouldn't have no
TV show or movies.

2202
01:36:58,326 --> 01:37:00,191
You all was coming to see me,

2203
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:01,922
and you all made me...

2204
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:04,931
Chattanooga,
Louisiana, Mississippi.

2205
01:37:06,134 --> 01:37:08,125
So thank you.

2206
01:37:08,202 --> 01:37:10,762
I think if I had
a few free passes

2207
01:37:10,838 --> 01:37:12,135
like a lot of people,

2208
01:37:12,206 --> 01:37:14,697
I don't think I would be
as successful as I have.

2209
01:37:14,775 --> 01:37:16,436
My task here on Earth

2210
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:19,639
is I have to work harder
than the average bear.

2211
01:37:19,714 --> 01:37:20,646
It look easy, don't it?

2212
01:37:20,715 --> 01:37:23,513
But it's not.

2213
01:37:23,584 --> 01:37:26,109
Thank you,
sweetheart. Thank you.

2214
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:34,822
<i>I never can say goodbye</i>

2215
01:37:34,896 --> 01:37:37,228
<i>No, no, no, I</i>

2221
01:37:53,848 --> 01:37:56,544

2222
01:37:56,617 --> 01:38:00,246

you're leaving me</i>

2223
