1
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,280


2
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,190


3
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,830


4
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,260
Hey, how did you open your cell door?

5
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,880
Hey!

6
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,200
what are you doing?

7
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,870
Open Sector 2!

8
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,390
How did you get out?

9
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,740
Get back in your cell.

10
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,110
I told you, get back in your cell!

11
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,570
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

12
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,590
Sorry.

13
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,370
Send some guards in.

14
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,530
l'm trying.

15
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,410
Okay, l'm set. How's things going down below?

16
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,310
How do you think? l'm in a sewer.

17
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,620
The doors won't open! we're locked in!

18
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,280
Sound the alarm!

19
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,120
we've lost control!

20
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,660
Captain!

21
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,940
l'm in position.

22
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,110
Move to phase 2.

23
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,910


24
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,570
What are you doing? What are you doing?

25
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,470
what's wrong? what's happening, Benji?

26
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,200
Oh, God. He's not going to the extraction point.

27
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,500
Stay focused. He knows where he's going.

28
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,410
No, l'm not. l won't.

29
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,990
l will not open that door.

30
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,320
Please go to the extraction point, Ethan. l know.

31
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,550
l know what this means,

32
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,180
but l can't. l'm not authorized...

33
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,360
Go to the extraction point, Ethan.

34
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,000
Go to the extraction point!

35
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,230
Oh, you're just going to wait.

36
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,400
we're going to wait. Great. l can wait.

37
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,550
Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

38
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,880
There. we'll just screw the whole thing up on purpose.

39
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,390
Jane? we're going to have a slight delay.

40
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,410
why do you want to go in there?

41
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,810
Bogdan!

42
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,060
Bogdan!

43
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,320
Sergei?

44
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,220
Time to go!

45
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,720
Now?

46
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,290
Yes, now!

47
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,930
l don't know what he's doing,

48
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
and for some reason, l'm helping him.

49
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,840
As long as he's where he should be when the song ends.

50
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,250
we have a passenger.

51
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,970
Sergei!

52
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,120
Open all of them!

53
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,560
Oh God!

54
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,340
Oh God oh God oh God...

55
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,240
Sergei, please tell me there's more to this plan!

56
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,920
Let's go...

57
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,280
Agent Hunt?

58
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,520
And you are?

59
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,280
Agent Carter.

60
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,120
Okay.

61
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,730
who's your pal?

62
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,390
l'll tell you on the way!

63
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,230
Light the fuse.

64
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,530


65
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,090


66
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,760
Sergei, what's going on?

67
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,880
lt's OK, Bogdan.

68
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,930
l don't mean to bring up the elephant in the room,

69
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,860
but what's with the big, hairy Russian?

70
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,830
who, Bogdan? He fed me intel.

71
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,200
lf l left him there, they would've killed him.

72
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,600
So we're gonna give him his freedom.

73
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,860
Did you call in the sweepers?

74
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,060
On their way.

75
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,930
Good, good.

76
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,000
Benji, how is it you're here?

77
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,070
Oh, l passed the field exam.

78
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,210
Crazy, right?

79
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,240
Yeah. Crazy.

80
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,940
-DNA test. -lt's me.

81
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,090
lt's procedure. l'm just confirming it's you.

82
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,550
-You're very thorough. -Sergei?

83
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,250
Are you not Russian?

84
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,380
Relax.

85
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,220
Sweepers approaching! Brooms are out!

86
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,960
-Roger that. -Sergei.

87
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,430
Are you not Sergei?

88
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
You'll be fine.

89
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,930
Bogdan.

90
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,470
l always take care of my friends.

91
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,540
My friend.

92
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,280
Messy bringing him along.

93
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,950
l thought it went rather well.

94
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,060
Mind telling me what you were doing in a Russian prison?

95
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,990
Mind telling me why you broke me out?

96
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,990
This wasn't a rescue mission?

97
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,060
Let me put it this way.

98
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,920
lf the Secretary wanted me out of there,

99
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,770
it must be pretty bad out here.

100
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,670
we were after a file.

101
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,740
we lost it.

102
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,340
"we"? who lost it? You?

103
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,020
Agent Hanaway.

104
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,780
where's Hanaway?

105
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,000
It was a letter drop.

106
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,960
Classified file.

107
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,630
It should have been a simple intercept.

108
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,780
We knew which train the courier was on.

109
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,810
ETA, two minutes on the courier.

110
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,380
But there was one thing we didn't know.

111
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,680
Bobcat, your train's six minutes out.

112
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,950
Who the courier was.

113
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,370
lt's now or never, Bobcat.

114
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,000
The courier delivering the file, what's his name?

115
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,230
Go ahead. Shoot. Go ahead. Shoot.

116
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,240
we are out of time.

117
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,670
l need a name, folks.

118
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,410
l can't track all these people at once.

119
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,090
Marek. Stefanski. For the love of God!

120
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,230
You got it?

121
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,360
Marek Stefanski.

122
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,100
Searching.

123
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,430


124
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,210
l'll take it from here.

125
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,890
Hey, you all right, buddy?

126
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,090
Hanaway dropped the mark and grabbed his bag.

127
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,700
Sit down. Catch your breath.

128
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,590
He had the file in his hands. Easy in, easy out.

129
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,760
File secured.

130
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,960
But we weren't the only ones after it.

131
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,970
Bobcat, someone else has crashed this party.

132
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,540
l'm not alone.

133
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,610
Local police?

134
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,740
No. Armed hostiles.

135
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,580
Hang tight, l'm coming!

136
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,060
Outrigger, back him up.

137
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,960
Negative, Outrigger.

138
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,860
Rendezvous southwest corner, 60 seconds.

139
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,130
Hanaway's lens cam drew a facial match

140
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,670
and triggered a warning.

141
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,140
But it was too late.

142
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,360
No!

143
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,620
You're going to be okay.

144
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,930
You're so beautiful.

145
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,360
l'm sorry, l...

146
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,000
l should have told you.

147
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,260
It was my op.

148
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,670
I put him in the field.

149
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,670
And she left him just alive enough for me to see him die.

150
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,400
l'm sorry.

151
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,960
You know her?

152
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,070
That's Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

153
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,400
works for diamonds.

154
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,210
what was in the file?

155
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,420
Russian nuclear launch codes.

156
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,420
lMF's been looking for an emerging extremist,

157
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,590
code name, Cobalt.

158
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,990
He's determined to detonate a nuclear weapon however he can.

159
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,930
we know Moreau's worked for him before.

160
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,600
what else does lMF know about him?

161
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,340
As much as you do now.

162
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,440
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

163
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,840
you can bet Cobalt's gone from a person of interest

164
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,350
to enemy number one.

165
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,680
we're here.

166
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,670
Agent confirmed.

167
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,810
why was he in prison?

168
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,640
He disappeared after he and his wife... You know.

169
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,820
l thought he'd just been transferred. Put on leave.

170
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,260
There were rumors, though.

171
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,660
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

172
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,390
Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

173
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,220
In your absence,

174
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,630
IMF has learned that Cobalt is or was

175
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,500
a level-1 nuclear strategist for Russian intelligence.

176
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,830
Therefore, the only way to uncover his actual identity

177
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,200
is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.

178
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,700
In order to get past their checkpoints,

179
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,710
you'll be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov.

180
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,610
We believe Cobalt will do everything he can

181
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,550
to destroy any record of his identity.

182
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,940
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

183
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,650
is to penetrate the highly-secured

184
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,850
archive inside the Kremlin

185
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,520
and retrieve Cobalt's file before he can destroy it.

186
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,960
New intel suggests Cobalt is already en route,

187
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,690
leaving you...

188
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,880
...4 hours 52 minutes... ...to infiltrate.

189
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,490
To save time, we've chosen your team for you.

190
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,300
Agents Carter and Dunn.

191
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,210
As always, should you or any member of your team be caught or killed,

192
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,210
the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

193
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,710
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.

194
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,370
Good luck, Ethan.

195
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,410
what do you got?

196
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,780
we're going into the Kremlin.

197
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,120
l thought you said "The Kremlin."

198
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,420
l thought you said "The Kremlin."

199
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,590
Okay.

200
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,630
This is very exciting.

201
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,140
Being out in the field.

202
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,970
with you, you know.

203
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,640
lt's a bit of a dream for me.

204
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,140
Love your disguise, by the way.

205
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,470
You look just like him.

206
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,940
lt's a shame we're not wearing masks.

207
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,640
You know, like, full masks.

208
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,150
Everybody gets to wear a mask but Benji.

209
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,090
Sorry.

210
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,950
l'm tense. l babble when l'm nervous.

211
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,020
l'm doing it again. Shut up, Benji.

212
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,630
Okay, seven security guards.

213
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,340
X-ray machines. Cameras. Metal detectors.

214
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,710
Just what we expected. we can do this.

215
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,010
Releasing in three, two, one.

216
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,860
Game face, game face. Kremlin game face.

217
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,060
General...

218
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,300
l am Major Egorov.

219
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,300
Your documents.

220
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,520
You should know your boss.

221
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,750
You should know your boss.

222
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,570
l can't find you.

223
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,780
Run it again...

224
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,180
...Private.

225
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,610
Egorov.-

226
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,630
Excuse me, General. l didn't recognize you.

227
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,470
You're going to regret this, Egorov.

228
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,140
l think that went quite well.

229
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,610
Just shut it.

230
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,610
Sorry.

231
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,200
lt's going to work.

232
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,200
l'm sorry, by the way. About you and Julia.

233
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,540
You know, not working out.

234
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,710
l wanted to say something before you went away, but...

235
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,380
l liked her, you know.

236
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,550
He's oft the phone now.

237
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,520


238
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,100
lt's empty.

239
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,570
The nest is empty.

240
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,780
Check in, Team Leader.

241
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,880
Over.

242
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,450
Repeat. Check in, Team Leader.

243
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,830
Have you made it to the Archive Room?

244
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,550
Captain! The Archive Room!

245
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,830
Run!

246
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,000
Someone is piggybacking our frequency.

247
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,030
Team Leader,

248
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,470
awaiting your go-sign. Standing by

249
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,810
 to detonate.

250
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,130
Abort.

251
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,480
Rendezvous nine-two.

252
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,060
Shut the gate!

253
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,660
Quickly!

254
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,430


255
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,360


256
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,690


257
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,500


258
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,830


259
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,140


260
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,010
Our media is no more truthful than yours,

261
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,880
American.

262
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,010
But we both know that the real cause of the explosion

263
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,680
was you.

264
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,390
Awaiting your go-sign, Team Leader.

265
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,530
Standing by to detonate.

266
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,700
The worst part for you,

267
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,870
"Team Leader,"

268
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,900
is l am the man assigned to make you sufter for it.

269
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,570
For what you did to my country.

270
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,380
This is a hospital...

271
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,040
Not a night club.

272
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,050
Misha...help me here...

273
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,180
Room twelve.

274
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,060
The doctors say he's lucky to be alive.

275
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,740
Only a mild concussion.

276
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,840
l don't give a damn about his health.

277
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,440
l have questions that need answering.

278
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,080
Be careful!

279
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,120
Prepare a transport.

280
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,950
Check over there!

281
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,670
Not a good idea.

282
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,140
lt seemed like one a minute ago.

283
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,130
All agents! Hot target heading west!

284
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,400
Consolidated Insurance. How may I help you?

285
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,360
SAT 20. Agent 82-Delta-Echo requesting immediate evac.

286
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,050
Rendezvous Alpha 113.

287
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,230
Confirmed. Alpha 113.

288
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,180
Details surrounding the intricate system of gas lines

289
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,990
that run beneath the square are still forthcoming,

290
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,790
but the majority of those lines date back to the Soviet era

291
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,930
and have not been updated in at least...

292
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:54,110
Anna... Anna... l've been thinking...

293
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,210
lt looks like we...

294
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,740
we should leave town for a couple of days.

295
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,610
Alex, you, me. Vacations.

296
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,050
-Now?

297
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,850
-Tonight.

298
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,440
Why are you speaking in English?

299
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,360
Just...

300
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,780
Just the three of us.

301
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,120
...may not have been an accident, but a targeted attack.

302
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,290
Preliminary numbers are just starting...

303
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,830
where will we go?

304
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,300
...to come in regarding those wounded in the blast.

305
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,660
We can confirm that 11 tourists...

306
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,830
Leonid? ...their nationalities still unconfirmed,

307
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,980
have been transported to area hospitals for treatment.

308
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,310
While Russian ofticials continue to blame a gas-main break,

309
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,680
experts are citing the shape of the blast area and the size of the debris field

310
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,520
as more consistent with that of a set explosive,

311
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,850
leading to speculation that this may have been

312
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,150
an undeclared act of aggression.

313
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:48,380
Although the Defense Ministry is maintaining

314
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,810
Although the Defense Ministry is maintaining that this is strictly an accident...

315
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,830
Anna,

316
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,170
pack a bag for Alex.

317
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,370
we're leaving now.

318
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,000
Anya!

319
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,030
Anya!

320
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,020
we have work to do.

321
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,780
Mr. Secretary.

322
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,220
l wasn't aware you were in Russia.

323
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,460
l'm not.

324
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,060
Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

325
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,300
Yesterday l flew in to accept the Order of Friendship

326
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,900
from the Russian Prime Minister.

327
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,470
Now l'm headed back to washington

328
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,570
to hand the President my resignation.

329
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,810
My Chief Analyst, william Brandt.

330
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,580
Do you have a pen?

331
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,650
-Pardon me? -A pen.

332
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,330
Yeah.

333
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,160
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

334
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,430
Chief Analyst, you say?

335
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,360
lf you're implying that l made a bad call...

336
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,660
European male.

337
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,000
Fifties. About six-foot, 180 pounds. Blue eyes.

338
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,600
who is he?

339
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,830
A crude drawing, but by your description,

340
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,610
that could be Kurt Hendricks.

341
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,330
190 lQ. Served in Swedish Special Forces.

342
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,270
Professor of physics, Stockholm University.

343
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,180
Specialist in nuclear endgame theory.

344
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,010
Asked to resign...

345
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,120
well, because he's crazy.

346
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,120
Cobalt.

347
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,390
You have to alert the Kremlin

348
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,520
that one of their strategists

349
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,960
has a nuclear launch device

350
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,130
and one of his operatives has the codes to activate it.

351
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,530
And what makes you say that?

352
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,800
l saw him

353
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,140
leaving the executive armory, bag in hand.

354
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,710
He set oft that explosion to cover his tracks.

355
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,840
lt could be weeks before the Russians know it's missing.

356
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,880
Unless we tell them.

357
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,650
They won't listen to us.

358
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,850
As far as the Russians

359
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,710
 are concerned, we just bombed the Kremlin.

360
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,660
The tension between the United States and Russia

361
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,890
hasn't been this high since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

362
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,820
And the blame,

363
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,330
right or wrong, points to lMF.

364
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,730
The President has initiated Ghost Protocol.

365
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,330
The entire lMF has been disavowed.

366
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,070
So what happens now?

367
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,580
Now, l've been ordered to take you back to washington,

368
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,910
where the DOD will label you as a rogue extremist

369
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,690
and hang the Kremlin bombing on you and your team.

370
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,090
Unless,

371
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,260
you were to escape

372
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,550
somewhere between here and the airport,

373
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,590
having assaulted

374
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,530
Mr. Brandt and me.

375
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,460
Sir?

376
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,570
You would then

377
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,700
illegally scrounge whatever material you could

378
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,540
from a backup supply cache that l've overlooked.

379
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,410
The same cache where

380
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,770
your team are waiting for further orders.

381
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,980
Sir, you may want to...

382
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,740
You will then disappear,

383
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,440
 and this conversation never having taken place,

384
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,550
your intentions would be unclear.

385
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,050
But if any one of your team is caught or killed,

386
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,780
they will be branded terrorists,

387
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,290
out to incite global nuclear war.

388
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,410
Your mission,

389
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,910
should you choose to accept it.

390
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,570
Ethan, you were my best man.

391
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,620
And l'm sorry it's come to this,

392
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,320
after all the sacrifices you made.

393
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,650
lf we don't meet again, l just want you to know,

394
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,420
l've always considered you a friend.

395
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,330
Stay down! Drive, drive, drive!

396
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,360
You okay?

397
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,450
Yeah.

398
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,360
Take a deep breath. Stay with me.

399
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,860
-Ready? -Yeah.

400
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,720
what do we do?

401
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,390
wait here.

402
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,560
where else am l going to go?

403
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,530
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

404
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,730
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

405
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,800
Hold your fire!

406
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,900
Hold your fire!

407
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,430
weapons down!

408
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,700
what are you firing at?

409
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,430
Two prisoners escaped from Rankow Prison today.

410
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,310
And this one?...

411
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,900
what do we know about him?

412
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,140
why would that work?

413
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,920
why would what work?

414
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,090
The flare on the body, why would that work?

415
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,370
lt did work. -Yeah, l know, but... -Hey!

416
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,120
But why?

417
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,320
l mean, how did you know that would draw their fire?

418
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,820
l didn't. l played a hunch.

419
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,330
Okay. All right, so what was your scenario?

420
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,430
Right, you... There's a guy being shot at in the water.

421
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,670
All of a sudden, decides to light up a flare and swim around?

422
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,170
l mean, what did you assume they'd be thinking?

423
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:21,940
-Thinking? -Yeah.

424
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,350
l didn't assume they were thinking.

425
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,520
l assumed they were shooting at anything that moved.

426
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,350
l just gave them a target. Look, these...

427
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,580
These guys aren't Rhodes Scholars, you know?

428
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,650
lt's really happening, isn't it?

429
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,370
Yeah.

430
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,030
Okay, you know what that sound is?

431
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,800
That's our ride out of here!

432
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,370
All right, it's a green car. Number 47.

433
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,810
l see green!

434
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,300
Okay, let's do it. Go, go, go, go.

435
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,060
All right, 47. 47...

436
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,880
l don't see it.

437
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,380
47... 47.

438
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,390
Oh, shit!

439
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,720
This is it. The manifest.

440
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,500
Enter your code.

441
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,650
Pole!

442
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,820
Jeez...

443
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,910
Press enter.

444
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,510
Retinal scanner!

445
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,510
Retinal scan required.

446
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,410
watch out!

447
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,250
Retinal scan required.

448
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,690
Agent confirmed.

449
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,440
Ethan? Jeez, l thought you were dead!

450
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,270
-we are. -who's this?

451
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,270
Agents Dunn and Carter.

452
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:59,780
william Brandt, Chief Analyst.

453
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,380
Analyst?

454
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,710


455
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,610
Agent confirmed.

456
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,890


457
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,790
How will the world finally end?

458
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,230
It is my job to predict the unthinkable.

459
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,230
To treat the death of billions as a game.

460
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,310
After 20 years of this, I was numb.

461
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,700
Until a new question crossed my mind.

462
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,810
What happens after the end of the world?

463
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,090
Are you sure your line is secure?

464
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,910
Every two or three million years...

465
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,990
Are you certain your line is secure?

466
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,660
...some natural catastrophe devastates all life on Earth.

467
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,160
But life goes on.

468
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,830
And what little remains is made stronger.

469
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,000
Put simply, world destruction is an unpleasant,

470
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,670
but necessary part of evolution.

471
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,700
What happens then, I wondered,

472
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,060
when mankind faces the next end of the world?

473
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,010
l don't care what you have to do to get him to Dubai.

474
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,620
l'll make it worth his while. Just do it.

475
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,190
I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki...

476
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,460
l'll be waiting for your call.

477
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,020
...thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes,

478
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,490
monuments to the unimaginable,

479
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,930
dedicated to the concept of peace.

480
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,030
It occurred to me here that nuclear war might have a place

481
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,200
in the natural order.

482
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,530
But only if it could be controlled.

483
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:40,210
Only if it touched every living soul equally.

484
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,500
lMF now believes this man,

485
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,210
Kurt Hendricks,is the nuclear extremist,

486
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,540
code name Cobalt.

487
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,650
Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin,

488
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,550
with what is likely a nuclear launch device.

489
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,060
Two days ago, Sabine Moreau

490
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,490
 killed one of our agents in Budapest

491
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,330
and relieved him of Russian nuclear launch codes.

492
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,570
lntel indicates she will check into

493
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,340
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

494
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,770
Marius wistrom is a known operative of Cobalt.

495
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,170
wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.

496
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,170
For the launch device to work, Cobalt needs the activation codes.

497
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,250
He's sending wistrom to buy them from Moreau.

498
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,520
The Secretary

499
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,180
is dead.

500
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,260
The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.

501
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,520
we're shut down.

502
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,600
No satellite, safe house, support, or extraction.

503
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:37,960
The four of us

504
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,940
and the contents of this car

505
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,710
are all that remain of the lMF.

506
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,040
And as of this moment, any action is unsanctioned.

507
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,770
So if you want out,

508
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,610
speak now.

509
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,290
Our mission is Hendricks.

510
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,430
we're all that stands between him and his goal.

511
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,900
Nothing can be left to chance.

512
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,970
Everyone connected with this man

513
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,300
is considered an asset with valuable information about our target.

514
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,800
No one can know we're still on line.

515
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,100
we lose Hendricks now,

516
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,240
we lose him forever.

517
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,810
So, what's the play?

518
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,510
wistrom will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.

519
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,780
Now we cannot let the launch codes leave the hotel,

520
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,750
but we need wistrom to lead us to Hendricks.

521
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,010
He'll only do that if he has the codes.

522
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,590
Or if he thinks he has them.

523
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,920
Our objective is to intercept the sale,

524
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,190
replace the authentic codes with counterfeits

525
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:39,990
and follow wistrom to Hendricks.

526
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,420
well, that's simple enough.

527
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,330
we snatch the codes, we gin up some fakes.

528
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,690
Jane, you double Moreau,

529
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,600
and sell the codes to wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

530
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,470
And how do you propose

531
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,010
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

532
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,170
we take her out.

533
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,010
Yeah, we take her out. But, you know, discreetly.

534
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,350
Discreetly?

535
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,160
Yeah.

536
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,350
Right, she's an asset.

537
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,850
Right. l get it. Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

538
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,150
He said... l'm spitballing. lt's not all gonna be gold.

539
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,850
-we don't touch wistrom. -All right.

540
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,960
Or Moreau.

541
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,060
She'll answer for Hanaway, but it has to be when l say.

542
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,130
After we hit Hendricks.

543
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,370
Only pack what we need.

544
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,950
Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we... You never know.

545
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:41,620


546
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,340
So even if we can double wistrom and Moreau,

547
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,170
how do we keep them in separate rooms

548
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,910
while having them think that they're in the same room?

549
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,180
we give the hotel a facelift.

550
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,940
wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

551
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:11,280
but, really, he'll be walking into our decoy room.

552
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,090
where l'll double Moreau.

553
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,920
Downstairs, Benji will double wistrom.

554
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,090
Masks!

555
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,730
And meet with the real Moreau.

556
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,090
And...

557
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,090
what am l doing?

558
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,440
You? You're the helper!

559
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,930
Helper. That's great.

560
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:33,270
Okay, so to the extent l understand what you're talking about here...

561
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,780
The Burj Khalifa, it's the tallest building in the world,

562
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,310
and you want to alter its infrastructure

563
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:41,940
with the hopes of convincing two people that they've

564
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,620
had a meeting, which actually really never happened.

565
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,290
Right?

566
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,970
Camels.

567
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,180
ETA on dry cleaning.

568
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,350
On my way up.

569
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,690
Okay, 34 minutes to door knock.

570
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,280
wow...

571
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,190
Okay, this is a slight wrinkle, but nothing to worry about.

572
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,300
we're just going to have to go into the server room from the outside.

573
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,370
what?

574
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,040
well, the firewalls on this building's server are military grade.

575
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,580
l mean, this would be a cinch if l could call Youssef back at headquarters,

576
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,550
but Youssef doesn't exist anymore, and neither do we.

577
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,080
l could hack it, but it would take too long.

578
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,420
Then hardwire in.

579
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,260
And there's four layers of next-gen security between us and the server room.

580
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,160
There's no way we can get to it from inside.

581
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,430
lf we can't get to the server, we don't control the elevators,

582
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,390
we don't control the security cameras.

583
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,490
This operation is over before it even begins.

584
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,560
l'm telling you, we can get to it from outside.

585
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:37,660
"we"?

586
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,170
l'm... l'm on the computer.

587
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,900
l'm just...

588
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,570
The helper.

589
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,010
what floor is it on?

590
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,640
130.

591
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,080
130?

592
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:58,880
-Vent ducts.

593
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,550
-Pressure sensitive.

594
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,550
Not enough time.

595
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:01,350
-Elevator shaft.

596
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,080
-lnfrared sensors.

597
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,290
Not enough time.

598
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,690
How am l supposed to do this?

599
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,290
God damn it!

600
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,280
Oh, that's high.

601
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,550
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling oft motion that disengages the bond.

602
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,080
when the meter is blue, that's full adhesion.

603
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,130
Easy way to remember, blue is glue.

604
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:35,620
-And when it's red?

605
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:36,950
-Dead.

606
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,560
Here's your cutter, okay? And your server interface.

607
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,630
Both going back here. One, two.

608
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,440
Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is

609
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,920
eleven stories up and seven units over.

610
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,910
Okay? Comm check.

611
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,140
Yeah. Copy.

612
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,900
So...

613
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,820
lt's 26 minutes to door knock.

614
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,600
Yeah.

615
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,270
25 minutes to door knock.

616
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,660
what the hell is that?

617
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,310
Yeah, what the hell is that?

618
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,510
lt's a sandstorm.

619
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,740
lt's a long way oft, Ethan.

620
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,320
Shouldn't be a problem.

621
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,320
24 minutes to door knock.

622
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,790
where's Ethan?

623
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,200
You've got to be kidding me.

624
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,380
23 minutes to door knock.

625
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,240
I'm at server level.

626
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,360
22 minutes to door knock.

627
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,100
The countdown is not helping.

628
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,100
l'm just saying.

629
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,330
I'm in.

630
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,960
That's great, Ethan. You're halfway home.

631
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,070
Located server.

632
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,810
Please tell me we're online.

633
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,550
All right, we're live.

634
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,330
Okay, l now have control of the elevators and the security cameras.

635
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,620
Time to redecorate.

636
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,160
Okay, you drive. And look out for wistrom and Moreau.

637
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,840
Moreau is at the elevators ahead of schedule.

638
01:00:58,550 --> 01:00:59,680
Go.

639
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,020
we can't open this door, can we?

640
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,290
The door?. No.

641
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,360
Ethan, you gotta get down here now.

642
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,230
Ethan!

643
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,030
Is there a problem? Ethan?

644
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,330
we're not gonna make it.

645
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,310
we have to make it.

646
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,670
where's Ethan?

647
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,000
Your line's not long enough!

648
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,830
No shit!

649
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,450
That was not easy,

650
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,380
but l did it.

651
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,950
what'd l miss?

652
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:58,470
The lens might be a little uncomfortable.

653
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,800
lt captures images and transmits them to the printer in the briefcase.

654
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,800
All right?

655
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,970
l can't see out of one eye, but l'm fine.

656
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,910
Blink twice to activate the shutter.

657
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,740
Notice the numbers are in order?

658
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,320
A perfect copy.

659
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,320
But the numbers are scrambled.

660
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,130
Masks?

661
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,090
60 seconds. You sure l shouldn't wear a mask?

662
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,160
You know, 'cause l'm not exactly Omar Sharif.

663
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,360
l'll play it French.

664
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,430
This is your tracking device.

665
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,630
-This is what you're tracking.

666
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,170
-The paper clip?

667
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:32,440
No, it's the paper.

668
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,930
lt's in the briefcase. lt's coated with isotopes which give oft a unique...

669
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,610
lt just means that you can track the documents

670
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,810
even if they switch briefcases. Range?

671
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,000
Not that good. lt's, like, half a mile.

672
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,280
Safest thing to do would be not let wistrom out of your sight.

673
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,780
ls that wistrom?

674
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,190
who's that with him?

675
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,880
l don't know. we don't have an uplink, so there's no facial recognition.

676
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,350
who's that with him?

677
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,350
That's Leonid Lisenker. Polish-born cryptographer.

678
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,860
He redesigned Russia's nuclear security after the Cold war.

679
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,530
He's here to authenticate the launch codes.

680
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:03,960
-Yes, he is. we are blown.

681
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:04,630
-No, we're not blown.

682
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,000
well, we will be as soon as he sees the counterfeit launch codes.

683
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,230
we're not blown.

684
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:09,870
He's in the elevator.

685
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,200
Delay them.

686
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,210
Benji, how long would it take you to reprogram the case?

687
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,490
A couple of seconds. what for, though?

688
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,380
To make an exact copy of the launch codes.

689
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,590
-what? -You can't do that.

690
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,590
-wistrom's on 22!

691
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:30,160
-Slow him down.

692
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:31,220
l'll do what l can.

693
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,400
wait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!

694
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:36,890
Hang on. Just a second.

695
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:40,260
You're talking about handing over active nuclear launch codes to wistrom?

696
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,840
Yes. Reprogram the case.

697
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:42,900
Listen... Stop!

698
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,670
Just listen to what you're saying.

699
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,000
You're fixating. You're not thinking clearly.

700
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,840
lt's not gonna happen. l won't let it!

701
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:50,410
33 and climbing!

702
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,700
Brandt, use your head now.

703
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,510
The mission is not the codes, the mission is Hendricks.

704
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:56,010
Then just let it play out. Give him bad codes. Neutralize him.

705
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,020
You know that won't do it.

706
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,720
Failure to a terrorist is just a rehearsal for success.

707
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,190
41!

708
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:02,220
we lose Hendricks today,

709
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:03,450
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

710
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,580
He finds another way.

711
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,230
with no lMF to stop him.

712
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,530
No. lt's now or never. Now, Brandt, give me the case.

713
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,760
Nothing can be left to chance. You said that.

714
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:11,760
You're the analyst.

715
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,930
Now, tell me there's not another way

716
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,040
for Hendricks to get those codes.

717
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:14,770
50!

718
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:15,600
You tell me

719
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:16,810
that this is his only avenue,

720
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,700
right here, right now, today.

721
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,270
You tell me that, l'll walk away.

722
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,710
-we go without.

723
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,650
-without masks?

724
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,050
-Jane needs to go. -Ethan!

725
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,120
we have no choice.

726
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,270
Ethan, you'd be walking in on Moreau unarmed. Face-first. Literally.

727
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,220
How do we know they've met?

728
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,460
-How do we know they haven't?

729
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,290
-Doesn't matter!

730
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,960
Damn it.

731
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,560
we have no choice.

732
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,350
Goggles.

733
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,280
what if they have met?

734
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,020
Come in.

735
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,550
which one of you is wistrom?

736
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,220
which one of you is wistrom?

737
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,400
l am.

738
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,740
l admire your work.

739
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,950
Sit.

740
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,750
where are my codes?

741
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,860
where are my diamonds?

742
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,250
Close by.

743
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,530
You have my payment?

744
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,920
when l see the codes.

745
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,370
Not to worry. Come in!

746
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,760
l thought we could have tea.

747
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,440
No diamonds, no codes.

748
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,280
No codes, no diamonds.

749
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:30,220
Kill this one.

750
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:31,780
we didn't come alone.

751
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,280
That hallway out there is a kill-box.

752
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,790
You know who we work for.

753
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:37,460
we come back with the codes,

754
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,460
or we don't come back.

755
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:41,630
How good is your backup?

756
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,300
The best.

757
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,570
I've killed the best.

758
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:51,630
Do you care for some sugar?

759
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:57,640
Enough. Let's get this done.

760
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,420
You want payment, l want guarantees.

761
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,320
when he's authenticated the codes,

762
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,080
l'll make the call and you get your diamonds.

763
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,650
That or

764
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,190
we all go home in buckets.

765
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:12,660
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

766
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,600
Get the papers.

767
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,510
ls there a problem?

768
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,520
lt's locked.

769
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,360
Forgive me. There must be a key.

770
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,190
One moment, huh?

771
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,580
My mistake. lt is a combination, not a key.

772
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:50,250
You tell me the numbers.

773
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,370
They're good.

774
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,700
Zero.

775
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,260
Zero.

776
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,200
Zero.

777
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:22,550
Come on, come on, come on.

778
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,000
lt was a pleasure doing business with...

779
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,500
wistrom has the launch codes. He's on the move.

780
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,010
Hey, l did as you asked. l did.

781
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,510
Now let my family go!

782
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,340
Release Leonid's family.

783
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:17,610
Thank God.

784
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,110
You can thank him in person.

785
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,130
lt was a pleasure doing business with you.

786
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,310
Kill him!

787
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,040
Moreau's on the move!

788
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:57,380
l've got her.

789
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,810
Jane?

790
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:00,980
She's an asset!

791
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,560
l need her

792
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,660
alive!

793
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,050
Acknowledge!

794
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,750
Acknowledge!

795
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,180
Ethan, wistrom is in the elevator.

796
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,680
l can't see Leonid, though.

797
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:26,210
Benji, slow him down.

798
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,610
Get me an elevator.

799
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,190
Find Leonid.

800
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,940
Benji, l've got a lock on wistrom. But l can't tell.

801
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,540
Is he still in the elevator?.

802
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,300
Benji?

803
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,090
Ethan. Over?

804
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:07,420
Benji.

805
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,550
Benji, l lost...

806
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,050
Ethan, can you hear me? Ethan, can you hear me?

807
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:11,950
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

808
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,220
Jesus!

809
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,300
Sit down!

810
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,970
-watch her.

811
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:24,900
-why me?

812
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,640
Because if l do, l'll kill her.

813
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,170
Hold it, Team Leader.

814
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:02,010
Did you really think l wouldn't catch up with you?

815
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,110
You and l are not enemies. lt was a set-up...

816
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,850
we'll find out your lies soon enough.

817
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,510
Move it!

818
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,340
l'm sorry about this.

819
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,100
Leonid. Benji?

820
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:37,200
Go for Benji.

821
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,080
l've got Leonid by the elevators. He's been shot.

822
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,340
what?

823
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:53,730
Hey, hey. Stay with me. Stay with me.

824
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

825
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,020
Jane! No!

826
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:18,000


827
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,900


828
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:25,520
Come on. Come on.

829
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,480
Now, what happened with Moreau, Jane?

830
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:21,750
She couldn't help us with Hendricks.

831
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,580
So let's throw her oft the building!

832
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:24,480
l didn't throw her.

833
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:25,650
Let's throw her oft the building!

834
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:28,090
She was not the mission, Jane!

835
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:33,160
The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks, who is in the wind

836
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,090
with nuclear launch codes!

837
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:38,200
Maybe you didn't notice the gun she had pointed at me.

838
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:40,530
Yeah, like you didn't notice the open window,

839
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:42,430
or that we're about a mile up in the air!

840
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,270
lt was an instinctive move.

841
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,770
lt doesn't matter! we're talking about a nuclear war.

842
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:49,810
The asset is more important than you.

843
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:52,110
where do you get oft telling me how well l executed?

844
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,180
we inherited you.

845
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,780
You're just a bureaucrat!

846
01:22:56,150 --> 01:23:01,040
Better have good news for me. ls he here? You think l need you to tell me what the mission is?

847
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,620
Yeah, l got it. Dunhill lighter.

848
01:23:02,730 --> 01:23:03,780
l'll be there.

849
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,720
And no one will be following me.

850
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,560
Just make sure no one's following you.

851
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,300
And how the hell did the Russians find us?

852
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:10,460
-what are you asking me for?

853
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,190
-Because you're communications!

854
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,300
You're in charge of covering our tracks.

855
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:16,000
You cannot aftord to make mistakes like that now, Benji.

856
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,470
You're not a technician anymore.

857
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,400
You're a field agent.

858
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:20,640
And you're just an "analyst."

859
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:22,140
Right?

860
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,040
Right?

861
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,710
who are you really, Brandt?

862
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:30,020
-what are you asking?

863
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:30,980
-what am l asking?

864
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,880
Let me see if l can put it another way.

865
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,700
How does an agent with skills like that

866
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,660
end up an analyst?

867
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,240
well, we all have our secrets.

868
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:57,510
Don't we, Ethan?

869
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,920
You tell me yours, l'll tell you mine.

870
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,100


871
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:27,110
l have friends in the region. Just sit tight.

872
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,540
l'll send someone to get you out of here.

873
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,070
what about Hendricks? what's the plan?

874
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,650
The plan was for us to stop him together.

875
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,270
well, what are you going to do?

876
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:36,680
Change the plan.

877
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:38,340
wait. That's it?

878
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,010
what are you going to do,

879
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,450
go after him alone?

880
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:46,230
would you care to explain yourself, Agent Brandt?

881
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:53,120
l was on a protection detail in Croatia.

882
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,520
Shadowing the assets,

883
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:56,960
husband and wife.

884
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,690
They were never supposed to know we were there.

885
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,800
whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.

886
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:06,310
Three days in

887
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:10,010
we caught wind that a Serbian hit squad

888
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:11,140
was after our couple.

889
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:14,010
But my team had it under control.

890
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,480
we knew they were coming.

891
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:19,020
But l couldn't shake this feeling

892
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,780
that l should warn the couple somehow.

893
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,320
l wanted to find a way to let them know.

894
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,420
But, you know, orders are orders,

895
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,660
so l didn't.

896
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:37,830
One day, the husband decides to leave the hotel and go for a run,

897
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:42,100
so l follow him, and l leave two men with the wife.

898
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:45,010
when l get back,

899
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,180
my guys are unconscious and the wife is gone.

900
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,420
Local police found her body three days later.

901
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,420
what was left of her, anyway.

902
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:03,100
That was my last day in the field.

903
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,770
l couldn't face another life-or-death situation after that.

904
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,110
So what happened to the husband?

905
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:11,700
l never saw him again.

906
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,310
Until two days ago in Moscow,

907
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:18,040
when the Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

908
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,480
No, that's not what happened.

909
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,880
She left him.

910
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:28,050
Yeah, l heard that one, too, Benji.

911
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,560
But, unfortunately, l was there.

912
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:36,400
Just like l was there when the Secretary got the phone call

913
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:38,890
that Ethan was in custody for killing

914
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,130
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

915
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,460
An unsanctioned hit. Yeah.

916
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:45,060
Disavowed.

917
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,250
The next thing l know,

918
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,590
l'm on a plane to Dubai,

919
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:03,420
wondering the whole time, do l tell him?

920
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,260
How do l tell him?

921
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,930
That l'm responsible.

922
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,000
l could have warned him.

923
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,670
l should have warned him.

924
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,770
But l didn't.

925
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:23,940
And she died.

926
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,620
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

927
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,390
l told you l would get him here. Didn't l say?

928
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:38,520
How do l know it's him?

929
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:40,490
Yes, it's him. You trust me,

930
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,290
l trust you. Right?

931
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:43,960
This is the guy!

932
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:46,860
This is the guy, the one l told you about.

933
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,370
So we can take these things oft.

934
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,840
Sorry. He's a great guy,

935
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:57,470
but he doesn't know you like l do.

936
01:28:57,850 --> 01:28:58,750
So,

937
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,710
you work for the American government.

938
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,980
And you're an arms dealer.

939
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,690
No, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.

940
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:10,310
He's "independent defense coordinator." Right?

941
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:13,220
That you are. Very classy job.

942
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:14,550
Listen. He's a friend.

943
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,160
Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

944
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:18,330
No, no. lt's okay. You can have them.

945
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,560
whatever arrangements you made with my cousin is between you and him.

946
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,340
You want something from me, you pay.

947
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,370
You misunderstand.

948
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,840
l'm not buying. l'm selling.

949
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:31,010
You're selling.

950
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,070
Selling what?

951
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,580
The future.

952
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,250
Yeah, l got all l need, thank you.

953
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:39,180
Our countries are on the brink of war.

954
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,750
war is very good for business.

955
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:43,350
Nuclear war?

956
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,860
Go on.

957
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,970
l'm looking for a man named Kurt Hendricks.

958
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:58,440
You may know him as Cobalt.

959
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,210
ln either case, l think you know what he wants.

960
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,110
l'll bet he even tried to buy it from you at some point.

961
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,620
Go on.

962
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,040
He has a case, he has codes.

963
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:12,550
But they're worthless without a tactical satellite.

964
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,890
l want to know where he'd get it.

965
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,590
A man with information like that

966
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:19,460
would be a potential terrorist.

967
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:22,060
And to your government,

968
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:26,390
a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

969
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,460
lf you help me,

970
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,810
my friends become your friends.

971
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,240
Sorry.

972
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,910
l cannot help you.

973
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,290
l certainly cannot tell you

974
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:50,920
that Russia quietly sold

975
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:52,490
an obsolete tactical satellite

976
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,530
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

977
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,260
And whoever gave them that idea?

978
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:02,100
An enterprising third party.

979
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:03,770
working on commission.

980
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:06,810
Helping old friends. Making new ones.

981
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:09,110
Can the satellite be shut down?

982
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:11,110
That would take special skills,

983
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,510
and you cannot do it alone.

984
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,310
what's in the bags?

985
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,970
lt's our gear.

986
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:44,540
How'd you get it?

987
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:46,140
Made a friend.

988
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,550
well, l'm glad we could help.

989
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,310
You could help now.

990
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:52,150
Look, Ethan, before we...

991
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:53,690
whatever happened, happened.

992
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:55,660
we still have a chance to clean this up,

993
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,990
but we have to do it now.

994
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:59,830
And we have to do it together.

995
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,730
Okay. So, where are we going?

996
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:11,510
lndia.

997
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:16,410
-lndia? lndia? -Sure.

998
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:17,740
Okay. Great.

999
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:23,180
Love the jet.

1000
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:25,350
wait till you see the car.

1001
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:33,220
Sidorov.

1002
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,900
How have you been, old friend?

1003
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:36,220
Oh, it's you.

1004
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:40,360
l've been busy with other things.

1005
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,430
But I'll be after you again soon enough.

1006
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:47,740
l understand you're looking for an American...

1007
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:48,910
l am.

1008
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:52,580
You're also looking for a nuclear launch device stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

1009
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,120
You're also looking for a nuclear launch device stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

1010
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:57,380
l am?

1011
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,920
l can help you find both.

1012
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,820
lf... we can come to an understanding.

1013
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:11,070
Brij Nath.

1014
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,730
Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

1015
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,730
On the surface, his entire network is state-of-the-art.

1016
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:19,470
But it's built on illegally acquired

1017
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:22,400
Cold war cast-ofts, including this, the Novosti satellite.

1018
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,510
Hendricks needs it to launch a nuclear strike,

1019
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:27,140
and we have to shut it down before he gets that chance.

1020
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,810
And to do that, we need to get the access code from him.

1021
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:31,240
One way or another.

1022
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,080
And if l don't,

1023
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,590
none of this works.

1024
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:40,110
You can do this. Yeah.

1025
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,100
A week ago, l would have believed you.

1026
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,440
l don't blame you for what happened.

1027
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:57,640
She took someone you cared about.

1028
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:59,440
That's not something you just

1029
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:01,310
let go.

1030
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:04,850
Did it make you feel better?

1031
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,020
when you killed the men who killed your wife?

1032
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,470
we can't get them back.

1033
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,300
Okay, to shut down the satellite,

1034
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:30,880
we have to manually tap into the central server.

1035
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:32,910
You'll enter through the exhaust vent,

1036
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,480
wearing this under your suit.

1037
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:37,410
Drop down into the computer array, and l'll catch you,

1038
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,180
then move you along the relay room

1039
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,720
and you jack into the panel.

1040
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:47,050
Okay, so we enter the party separately as guests.

1041
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:49,160
Ethan quarterbacks while Jane...

1042
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:50,690
Gets the codes from the billionaire.

1043
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,860
l switch oft the fan, you jump into the computer array,

1044
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,900
and l catch you, you plug in the transmitter

1045
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,260
then Ethan feeds me the codes which l

1046
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,400
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

1047
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:02,010
Okay, but you just breezed over something l think is really important.

1048
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:05,080
The computer array part, where l just...

1049
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:06,910
Jump?

1050
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:08,550
-And l catch you.

1051
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:09,080
-Yeah.

1052
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:11,180
l don't... why is that so hard to grasp?

1053
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,860
well...

1054
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,390
why? lt's a 25-foot drop.

1055
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:17,580
And we're using magnets.

1056
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,920
Yeah.

1057
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,690
ln light of our recent eftorts, the technology's...

1058
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:24,900
The science is sound. All right?

1059
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,470
l'd be more worried about the heat.

1060
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:30,030
And then there's that. what heat?

1061
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:32,300
well, it's like any computer, isn't it?

1062
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,210
lf you switch oft the fan, it's gonna get really hot!

1063
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:36,440
Of course.

1064
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:38,040
Relatively, you know.

1065
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:43,210
Of course it will. So l'm jumping into a...

1066
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:47,390
An oven, essentially.

1067
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:49,720
Yeah. Essentially.

1068
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:52,120
But l'll catch you.

1069
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,390
Great.

1070
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:05,560


1071
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:26,480
Aapka swagat hai, sir. welcome, sir.

1072
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:19,540
Comm check.

1073
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:22,720
Saturn's got your five-by-five, Jupiter.

1074
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:26,050
This is Pluto.

1075
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:30,390
l have arrived at the party.

1076
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:34,730
There he is.

1077
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,570
Get us that code.

1078
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:59,010
Venus moving in on target.

1079
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:12,190
Hook's in.

1080
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,270
You do make an impression.

1081
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:21,370
why am l Pluto?

1082
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:23,170
It's not even a planet anymore.

1083
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:25,440
well, l think Uranus is available.

1084
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,240
lt's funny 'cause you said "anus."

1085
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:42,900
l'm in position.

1086
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,890
Sending in the Rover.

1087
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,070
He's moving to you.

1088
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:52,570
Give him your back.

1089
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,040
Don't want to make it too easy for him.

1090
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,900
Are you gonna be talking the whole time?

1091
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:59,640
ln 20 minutes, l want a glass of

1092
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,510
Cuvee Louis in every guest's hand.

1093
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:05,660
And make sure all of them have a bottle to take home by the end of the night. Sure.

1094
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,580
lmpressed yet?

1095
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:13,390
l'm more of a bourbon girl.

1096
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,730
l'm Brij Nath.

1097
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:23,260
welcome to my humble home.

1098
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:47,420
And Rover's in position.

1099
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:50,030
Spinning down the turbine.

1100
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,130
He's e-mailing.

1101
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,310
Venus. Be Venus.

1102
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,940
Be Venus.

1103
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,320
Husband?

1104
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:13,980
Boytriend?

1105
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,290
More of a

1106
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:18,320
co-worker.

1107
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,930
Saturn, take the leap.

1108
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:26,760
Okay.

1109
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,140
Jumping.

1110
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:33,670
Jumping now.

1111
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,350
Jump now?

1112
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:39,480
Yes. Commit. Jump.

1113
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:40,750
-Jump.

1114
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:41,470
-Jump.

1115
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,620
-And l catch you.

1116
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,480
-Now.

1117
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:47,820
So,

1118
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:50,120
you're sure about this suit, right, Benji?

1119
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,290
Pretty sure.

1120
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,590
Now you're pretty sure?

1121
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:56,830
Jump.

1122
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,170
Oh, God. All right.

1123
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,170
Jump.

1124
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,630
Jump!

1125
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,850
Jupiter, he's gone.

1126
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,400
Did you jump?

1127
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:32,700
Should l not have jumped?

1128
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,730
'Cause l jumped!

1129
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:38,170
Stand by.

1130
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,750
l'm playing a hunch.

1131
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:50,220
Don't hit me.

1132
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:08,680
Hello?

1133
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:08,920
My God, you are

1134
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:10,560
My God, you are

1135
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:12,900
a passionate creature.

1136
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,580
l would like to show you my collection of art.

1137
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,250
l was waiting for you to ask.

1138
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:21,940
Then you have to find me.

1139
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,420
You're on.

1140
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:25,610
l'm heading upstairs.

1141
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:47,110
All right, now be careful, because it's probably getting a bit hot.

1142
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,770
We have to get to that satellite before Hendricks does.

1143
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:07,090
Look left. Look up.

1144
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:09,990
I find your capricious passion intriguing.

1145
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,430
Let me tell you one thing. He's not your type.

1146
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:16,730
Completely not your type. He's completely cold. I'm hot.

1147
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:21,310
Like all Indian men, I'm very hot.

1148
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:22,940
Eight o'clock. Hot! Very hot.

1149
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,510
He's at your eight o'clock.

1150
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:27,970
As you move towards me, you're getting hotter.

1151
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:30,680
whoa. Up, up!

1152
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:32,290
Up, up!

1153
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,150
Too much, too much, too much!

1154
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,490
l see you.

1155
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:45,490
l'd heard you have one of the finest private collections in the world.

1156
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:48,200
well, at the very least, it's private.

1157
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,210
Saturn?

1158
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:09,360
How we doing in the relay room?

1159
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:10,390
ln position.

1160
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:12,730


1161
01:44:12,930 --> 01:44:14,050
l see the satellite.

1162
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:22,060
Can l help you, gentlemen?

1163
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,700
l don't think so.

1164
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,710
Need those codes, guys.

1165
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:43,560
All originals from Chhatarpur District.

1166
01:44:46,930 --> 01:44:49,400
You know, the Tantrics believe

1167
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:55,400
that the Swadhisthana chakra hides our most subconscious of desires.

1168
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:51,310
Uplink to satellite. Reboot to original military specs.

1169
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:53,660
Download the virus.

1170
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:02,500
what the hell is that?

1171
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,140


1172
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:05,500
what the hell is that?

1173
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:06,640
what the hell is what?

1174
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,000
lt's going haywire!

1175
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:09,970
lt's downloaded a virus from the satellite.

1176
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:11,340
Hendricks is killing the server

1177
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:13,010
before we can kill the satellite.

1178
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:15,150
Hendricks is reprogramming the satellite.

1179
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:18,010
He's gonna have launch capability in five minutes!

1180
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,580
-Something wrong?

1181
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:20,480
-No.

1182
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:21,650
Jane, you gotta move.

1183
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:23,190
we need that code.

1184
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:25,150
Finally we're alone.

1185
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:35,330
Venus, now's the time. Kick his ass

1186
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:37,040
and get the code.

1187
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:40,510
we are alone, aren't we?

1188
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:43,840
No one will interrupt us.

1189
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:49,840
Move and l break your neck.

1190
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:52,710
The override sequence for the relay station.

1191
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:55,050
Say it now or never speak again.

1192
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:57,560
The codes.

1193
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:00,850
4682... 46, 82,

1194
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:03,360
93.

1195
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:07,190
Benji, what happened?

1196
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,340
The system's crashed! we're too late.

1197
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,370
No, no, no. He's revealed himself.

1198
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,160
Benji, can you pinpoint Hendricks' location?

1199
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:15,540
Hendricks is signaling out of a state-run

1200
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,400
TVstation 6.7 miles from here.

1201
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:18,700
Send me the coordinates.

1202
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,410
Good work, Brandt. Now get the hell out of there.

1203
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:21,720
Back me up!

1204
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:23,750
Jane, tie it oft with Nath and meet me at the rally point.

1205
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:30,880
Sleep tight

1206
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:33,860
Faster, Benji! Just straight through!

1207
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:39,400
wait! Stop!

1208
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:40,930
Take me through!

1209
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:42,100
It's not responding!

1210
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,170
A little bit of patience would be appreciated!

1211
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:01,620
l can't reach the top!

1212
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:05,390
More fan! More fan!

1213
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,630
More fan!

1214
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,930
There's nothing l can do! lt's maxed out!

1215
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:10,600


1216
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:27,270
Brandt?

1217
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:28,580
Brandt?

1218
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:33,620
Next time, l get to seduce the rich guy.

1219
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:46,390
Satellite weaponized and online.

1220
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:49,100
Upload the new authentication codes.

1221
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,140
Lock Russian Central Command out of the system.

1222
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:52,970
lsolate the sub.

1223
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:55,130
we'll fire just one missile,

1224
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,900
an apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

1225
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:00,150
That should start the ball rolling.

1226
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:01,320
I'm here, Ethan.

1227
01:49:01,450 --> 01:49:03,350
How long until Hendricks can launch a missile?

1228
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:04,640


1229
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:05,820
Less than 30 seconds!

1230
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:09,020
we need another route.

1231
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:12,160
Turn left up ahead, take the alley on the right.

1232
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:28,340
we have uplink.

1233
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,020


1234
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,550
Ethan, Hendricks has started the launch sequence.

1235
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:43,190
How much time until missiles are flying?

1236
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:44,650
Three minutes!

1237
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,030
we're three and a half minutes out.

1238
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:54,370
we can make it.

1239
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,370
we can make it.

1240
01:49:58,610 --> 01:50:01,230


1241
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:04,880
Captain...

1242
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:12,520
Connect to Central Command for launch verification.

1243
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:13,380
Right away.

1244
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,920
Proceed with Operation "lron Fist".

1245
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:19,890
Command to Launch is confirmed.

1246
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:22,330
Cease all further communication.

1247
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:23,430
Over and out.

1248
01:50:25,970 --> 01:50:27,260
Next left.

1249
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:41,580
Proceed.

1250
01:51:02,670 --> 01:51:04,800
Ethan? we're too late.

1251
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:06,940
The missile's in the air.

1252
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:21,150
There has to be a way to abort the warhead.

1253
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:23,120
lf there is one, it'll be on the launch device.

1254
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:24,550
we're gonna get that case.

1255
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,830
May there be peace on Earth.

1256
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:44,340
Disable the relay.

1257
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,810
Get wistrom! lnside, inside!

1258
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:24,050
wistrom destroyed the relay.

1259
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:25,170
Ethan went after Hendricks and the case, but...

1260
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:26,320
Doesn't matter if he has the case.

1261
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:27,850
we can't transmit the abort codes.

1262
01:52:28,090 --> 01:52:29,060
Can you fix it?

1263
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:31,850
Yeah... lt's gonna be pointless if we don't have any power.

1264
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:33,030
wistrom!

1265
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:35,660
-Jane!

1266
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,390
-l'm okay.

1267
01:52:38,570 --> 01:52:40,730
No, you are not okay. She's hit.

1268
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:42,660
You stay here and cover Benji.

1269
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:44,830
Benji, get this thing rewired and back online.

1270
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:45,910
l'll get the power on.

1271
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:47,540
we can do this.

1272
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:04,560
l'm taking that briefcase!

1273
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:09,700
No! No!

1274
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:58,460
He's been gone too long.

1275
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,060
Damn it! Listen.

1276
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:03,060
when the power comes on, these two drives go into this bay, okay?

1277
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:49,680
Mission accomplished!

1278
01:58:31,190 --> 01:58:32,410
Don't touch him!

1279
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,760
This one is mine.

1280
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:53,910
So,

1281
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,100
we are not enemies.

1282
01:58:57,780 --> 01:59:00,580
The phone call from that arms dealer in Dubai.

1283
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:02,370
You wanted me to find you.

1284
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,620
How else to believe this?

1285
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:17,060
Hospital?

1286
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:21,490
And in other news, eight weeks later,the debate continues.

1287
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:23,800


1288
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:27,440
Eyewitnesses remain adamant that the object was some sort of aircraft,

1289
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:31,300
but ofticials with the Department of Defense insist it was simply a meteor

1290
01:59:31,650 --> 01:59:34,140
large enough to be visible during daylight.

1291
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,350
You actually said that.

1292
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,010
Out loud.

1293
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:39,850
"Mission accomplished."

1294
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:41,090
l said it.

1295
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:43,590
You're still corny, Ethan.

1296
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:46,830
l can't imagine the look on that guy's face.

1297
01:59:49,130 --> 01:59:50,430
-Hey. -This must be them.

1298
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:51,670
Luther Stickell,

1299
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:54,170
the firm of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

1300
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:59,600
l blew an entire weekend on the bottom of the San Francisco Bay

1301
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:02,170
no thanks to you clowns.

1302
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:06,280
No, man, you know l got this.

1303
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:10,180
l know. l'll see you in Kandahar.

1304
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:15,180
Thanks for meeting me.

1305
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:20,290
So, l hear the insurance company's refusing to pay the claim on that car you crashed, Ethan.

1306
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,630
Something about

1307
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:24,030
intentional 100-meter vertical drops not being covered.

1308
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:25,630
Go figure.

1309
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,200
How's the leg?

1310
02:00:30,670 --> 02:00:31,870
Still working.

1311
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:33,860
You?

1312
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,540
Healing.

1313
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:38,570
l'm fine, by the way.

1314
02:00:40,010 --> 02:00:41,480
l mean, l'm not actually sleeping, per se.

1315
02:00:41,850 --> 02:00:44,720
You know. Cold sweats. Middle of the night.

1316
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:48,660
All these people are just happy and smiling

1317
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:52,970
and they are completely oblivious to the fact that they were almost vaporized.

1318
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:55,500
And if it hadn't been for...

1319
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,990
Dumb luck?

1320
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:58,550
was it?

1321
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:03,560
l mean, look, we were unprepared, in the dark.

1322
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:05,340
Disavowed.

1323
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:08,340
And the only thing that functioned properly

1324
02:01:09,110 --> 02:01:10,580
on that mission

1325
02:01:11,610 --> 02:01:13,170
was this team.

1326
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:17,410
l don't know how we ended up together,

1327
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:21,020
but l'm glad we did.

1328
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:29,690
Your missions.

1329
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:32,200
Choose to accept them.

1330
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:39,770
Hey, look, l'm in.

1331
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,040
Seriously. lt's not as if any mission

1332
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:43,770
is gonna be rougher than the last one, is it?

1333
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:48,620
l mean, that's just... Bomb... ls it?

1334
02:02:06,770 --> 02:02:08,060
Thanks, Ethan.

1335
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:09,560
Thank you.

1336
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:12,560
Agent Hunt.

1337
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:13,970
Agent Carter.

1338
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,670
Brandt.

1339
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:29,020
l'm not picking up that phone, Ethan,

1340
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:31,490
because l don't think you want me in the field.

1341
02:02:34,530 --> 02:02:36,330
l know your wife is dead.

1342
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:40,660
l was there in Croatia.

1343
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:44,090
l was there for one reason.

1344
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:45,600
One.

1345
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:47,670
And l failed.

1346
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:53,670
lt was my job to protect her.

1347
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:55,850
How do you know she's dead?

1348
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:00,350
There was a body.

1349
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:02,020
Did you see it?

1350
02:03:05,730 --> 02:03:07,790
You killed those Serbians.

1351
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:09,190
l had to get her back.

1352
02:03:09,330 --> 02:03:10,460
You were sent to Rankow Prison.

1353
02:03:10,730 --> 02:03:12,490
That was a sacrifice l was willing to make.

1354
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,300
lMF suspected Hendricks had people in Rankow.

1355
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:20,630
And six dead Serbians was the ideal cover.

1356
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:24,370
waste not, want not.

1357
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:43,230
The Secretary never told me.

1358
02:03:47,370 --> 02:03:50,340
l accepted the Rankow Prison mission on one condition:

1359
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:52,900
That no one could know she was still alive.

1360
02:03:54,610 --> 02:03:56,910
But you're telling me.

1361
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:07,410
when did you find out that l was in Croatia?

1362
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:10,090
l pulled your file after lndia.

1363
02:04:11,130 --> 02:04:12,250
Right.

1364
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:16,760
So you had to fake your wife's death.

1365
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:20,690
As long as we were together, she could never be safe.

1366
02:04:21,970 --> 02:04:24,600
lt wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

1367
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:28,370
lt's mine.

1368
02:04:30,660 --> 02:04:31,720
Okay.

1369
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:36,950
So we're good.

1370
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:39,550
we're good.

1371
02:05:39,370 --> 02:05:41,090
Come on!

1372
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,130
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1373
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,830
36 hours ago,

1374
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:06,530
there was a breach in our military's communication network.

1375
02:06:06,910 --> 02:06:10,040
Now, an emerging terror organization known as The Syndicate

1376
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:12,380
has control of our entire drone fleet.

1377
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:14,040
Their targets: Unknown.

1378
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:15,310
Your mission,

1379
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,750
should you choose to accept it...
