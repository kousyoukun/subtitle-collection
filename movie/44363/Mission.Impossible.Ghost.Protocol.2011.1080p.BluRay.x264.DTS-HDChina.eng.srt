we lose him forever.

So, what's the play?

615
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,729
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau
in 36 hours.

616

Now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,

but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

618
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,112
He'll only do that if he has the codes.

619
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,613
JANE: Or if he thinks he has them.

620
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,949
Our objective is to intercept the sale,

00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,284
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

622
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,161
and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.

623
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,621
Well, that's simple enough.

624
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,915
We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

625
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:48,628
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

626
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:52,132
And how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

627
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,299
We take her out.

628
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,138
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,472
Discreetly?

- BENJI: All right.

634
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,067
Or Moreau.

635
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,406
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

Wistrom and Moreau,

they're in the same room?

ETHAN : We give the hotel a facelift.

644
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:09,125
Wistrom will think
he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

645
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,461
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

You were sent to Rankow Prison.

had people in Rankow.
