1
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,029
- Up yours!
- Get out of the way!

2
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,527
Fine time piece, brother?

3
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,530
Goodbye.

4
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,667
"Who's the black private dick
that's a sex machine to all the chicks?

5
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,460
"Shaft

6
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,337
"Damn right

7
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:44,850
"Who is the man that would risk his neck
for his brother man?

8
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,518
"Shaft

9
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,604
"Can you dig it?

10
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,449
"Who's the cat that won't cop out
when there's danger all about?

11
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,534
"Shaft

12
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,077
"Right on

13
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,497
"They say this cat is a bad mother

14
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,665
"Shut your mouth

15
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,125
"I'm talking about Shaft

16
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,877
"Then we can dig it

17
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,046
"He's a complicated man

18
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,130
"No one understands him

19
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,883
"But his woman

20
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,384
"John Shaft"

21
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,345
What's happening, Marty?

22
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,889
Same old sixes and sevens, Shaft.

23
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:28,101
Two guys were looking for you
like 10 minutes ago.

24
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,561
Harlem cats?

25
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:34,441
How the hell should I know?
Everybody looks the same to me.

26
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,861
Take it easy, Marty.

27
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,696
Take care, Shaft.

28
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,531
Thanks, brother.

29
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,122
Too much sugar this morning.

30
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,457
Then don't drink it, baby.

31
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,421
A couple of dudes from uptown
looking for you.

32
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,965
Know them?

33
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,259
Not by name.

34
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,305
Seen them around uptown.
Come in here when I was opening up.

35
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,099
Asked where they could find you.

36
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,226
What did they look like?

37
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,563
One was wearing a funky plaid coat.
Other one was sharp.

38
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,276
$50 shoes. Black coat, gray flares.

39
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,739
- Is that all?
- They had heat on them.

40
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,159
The one in the plaid coat
had his hands in his pocket.

41
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,369
Pulled his coat tight, you dig?

42
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,040
Had some heavy iron in his belt.

43
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,168
You got a scuff on the toe of this left shoe.

44
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,593
What time you got, Tom?

45
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,178
8:16.

46
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,603
Pull over in front of that shoe-shine parlor.
He usually hangs out there.

47
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,812
Okay.

48
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,654
- You want me to go in?
- No. We'll wait.

49
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:52,454
Got yourself a nice shine. You can go out
and make something of yourself, man.

50
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,585
Go out and get rich and fat like you?
We're straight, baby.

51
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,092
Got a minute, Shaft?

52
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:09,221
Got no use for no dirty postcards, Vic.
Get off my back.

53
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,306
I just want to talk to you.

54
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,767
Call me up. You know my number.

55
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,982
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Go sit in the park a minute?

56
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,235
Hell, no. Just tell me
what you got to say right here!

57
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,656
Tom, go get us two cigars.
What kind do you smoke?

58
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,950
Just say what you've got to say.

59
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,246
Get us a couple of El Garcia's.

60
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,877
Look, I'm late.

61
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,005
What are you trying to lay on me?

62
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,799
Just love, Shaft.
Nothing but love and sympathy.

63
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,052
Then we're even. Go on, get on with it.

64
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,222
I thought you might know something
I want to know.

65
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,601
Seems there's been a lot of low,
quiet rumbles going on uptown.

66
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,563
Our people have been able to pick up
the sounds of it, but not words.

67
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,858
That's 'cause us black folk
talk mush mouth, Lieutenant.

68
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,278
I thought we'd get to it.

69
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,157
We did. But, you want me to pigeon.
I just said, "Up yours, baby."

70
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,829
How come two cats from Harlem
came downtown this morning...

71
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,706
...looking for John Shaft?

72
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,045
They're soul brothers. They came down
so I could teach them the handshake.

73
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,089
They find you?

74
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,008
Of course, I wasn't hiding.

75
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,930
If you find out anything, give me a call.
I'm still at the 38th Precinct.

76
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,182
Right on.

77
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,477
Where the hell are you going?

78
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,314
To get laid. Where the hell are you going?

79
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,113
That boy's got a lot of mouth on him.

80
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,037
The boy's man enough to back it up, too.

81
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,040
What did he tell you?

82
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,542
Nothing.

83
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,794
Got to lean on that kind.

84
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,672
You don't lean on that kind.

85
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,094
Give me a package of gum.

86
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,052
Make a noise, I'll cut you. Back up.

87
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,805
- Something wrong, Mr. Shaft?
- Sick friend here.

88
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,849
Jim, can you get us a car up?

89
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,355
I'll take that.

90
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,567
Now, be cool, man.

91
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,747
Where is your partner?

92
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,382
Open the door.

93
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:22,140
You've got about a half a minute
to tell me what the hell you want with me.

94
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:26,186
The police will ask why you threw
that son of a bitch out the window.

95
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,732
They can find you dead or alive.
Now, what's your goddamn story?

96
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,818
Bumpy...

97
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,446
Bumpy says to bring you uptown.

98
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,949
Did he tell you to mess me up?

99
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,120
I was to bring you.

100
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,585
It doesn't make sense.

101
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,671
You arrive at your office.
You have a sick friend with you.

102
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,049
Suddenly, another man you don't know
rushes up and a fight starts.

103
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,261
Your sick friend goes out the window.
Why, Mr. Shaft?

104
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,223
Ask the man who started the fight,
Mr. Leibowitz.

105
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,101
Your friend, the only name
you know him by is "Tex"?

106
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,145
- No last name?
- That's right.

107
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,605
I don't buy that, Shaft.

108
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,609
I think you know more than that.
Why the fight started, for instance.

109
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,778
What you think and what you can prove
are two different bags.

110
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,160
All your friends walk around
with weapons like that?

111
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,704
That depends.

112
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,874
My Negro friends don't walk around
with rabbits' feet no more.

113
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,169
Don't get wise with me.
There's a simple way for me to go.

114
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,089
- I'll put your goddamn ass in!
- I'll sue your goddamn ass for false arrest.

115
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,259
You want me to believe the man fell out
the way you said he did?

116
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:43,430
- What do I look like? Some kind of klutz?
- Don't ask, and I won't tell you.

117
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,849
You're licensed by the city and the state.

118
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,686
No one licensed can afford to be a wise ass
where a felony case is involved.

119
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,939
Are you suggesting I'd lose my license?

120
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:55,192
You are damn right I am!
You better believe it and level with me!

121
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,238
Threatening my livelihood is a violation
of my rights, isn't it?

122
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:04,993
Byron...

123
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,041
Let me have a talk with him in private.

124
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,920
You got an assailant to interview.

125
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,381
Start that and I'll join after we talk.

126
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,176
I think you are b.s. -ing me, too.
This thing stinks.

127
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,864
Maybe he didn't like the handshake
you taught him.

128
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,702
You know you can get your rump
in a sling for this mess?

129
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,705
- Static, a lot of hassle.
- You'll save me, Vic.

130
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,124
Well, I can try.

131
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,208
lf?

132
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,128
One hand washes the other.

133
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,924
All the hassle in the world wouldn't
make me sing a song to the police.

134
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:02,885
No way, baby.

135
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,806
That cat you threw out the window
was a flunky for Bumpy Jonas.

136
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,268
I didn't throw no cat
out no window, Lieutenant.

137
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,187
Bumpy isn't gonna like it.

138
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,982
I don't care what he likes!
What the hell are you pumping me for?

139
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,318
Two weeks ago
we started picking up rumbles.

140
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,906
- You already said that.
- We know it's not the Panthers.

141
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,951
Or the Young Lords.
But, something's on the boil.

142
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,871
I want to know what it is...

143
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,249
...before we need an adding machine
to count the bodies.

144
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,418
Bumpy wants you for something.

145
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,838
He knows what's going on.
And that's what I want to know.

146
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,965
Not who, just what.

147
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:47,346
It warms my black heart to see you
so concerned about us minority folks.

148
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,975
Come on, Shaft.
What is it with this black shit?

149
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,688
You ain't so black.

150
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,734
And you ain't so white, baby.

151
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,738
All right.

152
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,659
You want to play
your super heavy black number.

153
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,162
I'm gonna play mine.

154
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,668
We can nail your tail for manslaughter
with what we've got on you right now!

155
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,381
You can waltz Leibowitz, but you
know the law. You could be charged.

156
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,633
Charged, Lieutenant.

157
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,135
Yeah, but your license'll be suspended.

158
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,013
You'll be out of business for six months.

159
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,350
You want to be out of business
for six months?

160
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,769
Out on the street.

161
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,272
No gun permit. Six months!

162
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,901
With Bumpy looking for you
when all hell's about to break loose?

163
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,361
You want it, you got it.

164
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,948
You scare me to death, Lieutenant.

165
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,952
You're buying trouble not only for yourself,
but a blood bath up in Harlem.

166
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:52,995
You want that?

167
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,709
All I'm asking you is to let me know
what's going on!

168
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,253
No names, no places, just what!

169
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,466
I'm not asking you to sell out.

170
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,263
Tell me the name of the game,
so I know the rules.

171
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,822
I'll think about it.

172
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,076
All right, I'll settle for that now.

173
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,623
That buys you 48 hours on the street,
and then we're gonna talk again.

174
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,460
You got the number
of Bumpy's private phone?

175
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:44,963
All right.

176
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,091
Take off. I'll see to Leibowitz.

177
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,595
Right on.

178
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,806
I'll see you.

179
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,567
Look at that.

180
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,525
- Wrong number.
- Don't bull me, I got the right number.

181
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,818
This is Shaft.

182
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,778
How did you get this number?

183
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,531
Off a bathroom wall
in the goddamn subway.

184
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,616
I'm looking for you.

185
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,535
I've got an office.

186
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,174
Here you are.

187
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:11,592
Thanks.

188
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,469
Bag of chestnuts, please.
Cold as hell today, huh?

189
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,431
Yeah, yeah. Good chestnuts.

190
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,601
How much?

191
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:21,852
Two bits.

192
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,896
- Here you go. Take it easy.
- Thanks.

193
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,147
Hey, taxi!

194
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,237
What the hell is this?

195
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,573
You white mother!

196
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,368
Taxi! Taxi!

197
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,208
Cat say he gonna be here,
he should be here.

198
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,501
Open it up.

199
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,240
Cat say he gonna be here...

200
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,368
...and he ain't.

201
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,706
It ain't right, Boss.

202
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,667
We'll wait.

203
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,755
You take crap off of him...

204
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,091
...he'll give you more crap.

205
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,635
We'll wait.

206
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,430
That's some cold shit...

207
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,517
...throwing my man, Leroy,
out the window.

208
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:30,564
Just picked my man up, and threw him
out the goddamned window.

209
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,777
Got us standing around and waiting
to say thank you.

210
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,785
Glad you let yourself in, Bumpy.

211
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,373
Give me a bad name,
have you hanging around in the hall.

212
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,545
If the man ever comes down here...

213
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,964
...again to see you...

214
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,842
...you make sure you be here.

215
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,011
Waiting.

216
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,472
You're in my chair.

217
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,158
Wait outside.

218
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,670
Sims and Leroy tried to muscle you, Shaft?

219
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,843
Well, I got no grudge about Leroy.

220
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,719
I couldn't give a damn.

221
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,304
I got a job for you.

222
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,224
I'm not on the hustle, Bumpy.

223
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,600
A detective job.

224
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,063
- What kind?
- Your kind. You take it.

225
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,150
Don't jive me. What are you talking about?

226
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,611
Somebody kidnapped my daughter, Marcy.

227
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,655
Done in a couple of people.

228
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,117
Didn't leave no ransom note or nothing.
Nobody saw nothing.

229
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,704
I want you to find her.
That's the fucking job.

230
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,041
The police do that for free.

231
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,170
Not for me. You know I can't go
to the cops.

232
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:18,714
And you want me?

233
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,924
The spade detective.

234
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,261
Yeah, I want you 'cause
you're a black spade detective.

235
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:29,016
I want you 'cause you got your other foot
in whitey's trough! She can be anywhere.

236
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,520
Got any idea who grabbed her?

237
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,774
A lot of cats hate my guts.

238
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:42,070
A sweet, loving dude like you?

239
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,240
Sweet talking a man's lady...

240
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,952
...as you beat her man out of his paycheck
in the back room of a horse parlor?

241
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,246
Feeding his kid shit to shoot in his arm?

242
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,667
Who could hate you, Bumpy?

243
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,464
My baby never sold nothing to nobody.
Never took nothing from nobody.

244
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,384
She's a straight kid.
She's going to college.

245
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,765
Whoever grabbed her, got her to get at me.

246
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,478
They have a beef with me,
they should come to me.

247
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,565
So you got a rule
that somebody else don't.

248
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,948
Is that all you know?

249
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:30,160
There's a piece of Harlem I can't get at.
The one them militants got their arm on.

250
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:34,498
They could have my baby.
She's been into some of that stuff.

251
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,085
Bunch calls themselves the "La Mumba's."

252
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:40,337
Ben Buford's thing.

253
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,507
I could send my people to ask them.

254
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:45,717
Shit.

255
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:50,973
It'd come to a shootout and when
it's all over, a bunch of dead cats.

256
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,309
And maybe they'd kill Marcy.

257
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,523
Yeah, you're Papa pimp to them.

258
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,319
They want to see you burn
as bad as they want to see the police burn.

259
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,281
But kidnapping sisters,
that ain't their thing.

260
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,325
The only reason anybody grabs
anybody for is money.

261
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,663
What other bunch in Harlem needs money
bad enough to grab my baby?

262
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:18,709
If you believe that, what's all this
about me having a foot in whitey's trough?

263
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,962
I said I think they had her.
I didn't say they had her in Harlem.

264
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,756
They ain't dumb enough
to take her someplace uptown.

265
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:27,968
It don't lay right.

266
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,138
What the hell you think I need you for
if I knew who had her?

267
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:34,850
I'm guessing.

268
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,395
If they don't have her, all right.

269
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,480
Maybe they know something.

270
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,983
I got nothing.

271
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,444
That's the job, Shaft.

272
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,406
Will you take it, or no?

273
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,621
I get $50 an hour.

274
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,123
Plus expenses.

275
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,461
And no questions asked
about how I spend it.

276
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,047
You got it.

277
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,799
I get a free hand to move any way I want.

278
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,972
You find my baby.

279
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,602
That's all I want.

280
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,023
I got money.

281
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,568
You spend it.

282
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,197
And you find her.

283
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,254
That'll get you started.

284
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,983
When will I hear from you?

285
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,072
When I got something to say.

286
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,118
One more thing:

287
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:23,834
You send another cat after me with a gun,
I'll kill him and I'll come looking for you!

288
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,837
And I'll get you, Bumpy.

289
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,338
You believe it.

290
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,446
Fake mother.

291
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,625
"Black man born free"

292
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,543
You seen Ben Buford around?

293
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,171
"The way it's supposed to be

294
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,883

00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,887

00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,390

00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:25,479
"It's got plenty of names
'Slums"'

298
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,316
Ben Buford used to live here.
He live here anymore?

299
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,235
No, why?

300
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,612
I'm looking for him.

301
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,281
I am, too. He owes me six months' rent.

302
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,368
Take it easy.

303
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:45,541
"Any kind of job is hard to find

304

"Little boy who needs a pair of shoes"

310
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,240
Hello, ma'am. I'm looking for a guy
named Ben Buford. You know him?

311
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,700
Yeah, I know him.

312
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,619
- Seen him around here lately?
- Not in a long while.

313
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,873
"Some of the brothers got plenty of cash

00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,611
I'm looking for Ben Buford.
You seen him around?

321
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,529
No, I ain't seen him.

322
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,531
Thanks.

323
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,868
Know what the number was today?

00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,558
Seen Ben?

337
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,227
Ben? Ben who?

338
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,729
Ben Buford. You know who I mean.

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,030
That Ben Buford.

342
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:25,701
He's holed up on a place
on Amsterdam, 710.

343
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,704
What apartment and what time?

344
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,416
Third floor. There's a meeting at 9:00.

345
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,960
I can't guarantee it.

346
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,213
I just heard some cat tell another cat.

347
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,383
They're both in the movement with Ben.

348
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,762
Yeah, well, stay loose, baby.

349
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,920
You all right?

350
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,631
Baby, are you all right?

351
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,844
I got to feeling like a machine.
That's no way to feel.

352
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,600
Come here, baby.

353
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:47,634
Had a visitor from uptown this afternoon.

354
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:50,387
What're you having?

355
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,306
A dog with mustard and onions.

356
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,183
No.

357
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,642
Hold the onions.

358
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,314
Cold, huh?

359
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,196
Well, John, what did you get?

360
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,579
I got laid.

361
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:39,478
Uptown, brother. Amsterdam Avenue.
Take your time. I'm early.

362
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,073
Champ, you lost?

363
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,116
No.

364
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,743
You live around here?

365
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:37,786
Yeah.

366
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,497
You look cold.

367
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,921
Get something to eat.

368
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,632
Gee, thanks, mister.

369
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,301
Okay, champ.

370
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,632
- Who is it?
- John Shaft, Ben.

371
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:36,780
Unless you want more visitors,
better split up that pair out front.

372
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,034
Put somebody on the basement door.

373
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,412
How did you find me?

374
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:46,039
Wasn't hard. You got a big mouth.

375
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,544
- Cool it, man.
- You cool it, boy.

376
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:56,675
Don't let your mouth
get your ass in trouble.

377
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,889
- I got nothing to say to you.
- Don't jive me.

378
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:08,145
- We've put in a lot of street time together.
- That was a long time back.

379
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,314
I don't know you no more.

380
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:13,734
A lot of hard years, man.
The kind you don't forget.

381
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:21,617
Now, I'm gonna give you one minute
to say what you came here to say.

382
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:26,580
Then you go back out that door
you came in or I'll throw you out.

383
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,459
You know Marcy Jonas?

384
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,669
- Yeah, why?
- You know where she is?

385
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,547
- What do you mean?
- Somebody grabbed her.

386
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,926
Bumpy thinks maybe it was you.

387
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,014
We don't do that kind of thing.

388
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,058
You know anything about it?

389
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:50,020
Tom, you used up your minute. Get out!

390
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,605
Don't "Tom" me, man!

391
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,107
- Where are the guns?
- None here.

392
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:55,692
I'll be goddamned!

393
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,198
Sonny! Sonny!

394
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,574
They're coming!

395
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,409
- Up on the roof?
- Yeah. Go!

396
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,831
He's dead.

397
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,332
Come on, come on!

398
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,335
Not the roof, this way!

399
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:23,262
Stand back.

400
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,890
- What is this?
- Everything will be fine.

401
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:29,935
- What is this?
- Go over there and be quiet.

402
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:23,572
Everything's okay, ma'am.
No need to worry.

403
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:26,909
Sorry about your door.

404
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,077
That'll take care of it.

405
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,581
You set us up, man!

406
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,460
Young man, please.

407
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:38,921
Don't do that.

408
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:44,092
Don't ever threaten me again!
And don't call me Judas!

409
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,054
Come on. It's no time
to count your dead. Come on!

410
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,113
Look.

411
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,538
Come on!

412
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:01,920
This way, this way!

413
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,426
One of yours?

414
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,596
- No.
- Probably a finger man.

415
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:30,574
When you lead that revolution,
whitey better be standing still...

416
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,368
...'cause you don't run
worth a damn no more!

417
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:34,870
We're done running, man.

418
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:37,331
What the hell do you call this, man?

419
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,771
I got to find out if they're after you or me.

420
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,743
I'll leave you with some friends.
They're straight people.

421
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,121
So don't you lay any of
that Uncle Tom jive on them.

422
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:28,590
I don't know what's connected to what.
I can't piece them together.

423
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:29,883
Answer that.

424
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:35,389
It's only a half an hour since it happened.
How could I have something this soon?

425
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:41,228
I'm not paid enough to worry about what
the Commissioner or the Mayor thinks!

426
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,730
It's Shaft. You want to talk to him?

427
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:46,441
I got a call. I might have something.
Hold on.

428
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,694
No, better I call you back.

429
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:53,490
I'm coming to see you.

430
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,201
You've been holding out on me.

431
00:42:56,577 --> 00:43:00,038
I'll wait. Listen, several cats
were killed in Harlem.

432
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:01,748
You know anything about it?

433
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:03,625
I was there, Lieutenant.

434
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,806
The Captain's at home. Call him back.
Tell him I left to chase down a lead.

435
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:21,268
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Just get him off my back.

436
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:23,979
A reporter from the News
wants an interview.

437
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,442
Tell him to call the Captain.
Serves the old bastard right.

438
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,362
This is that list
from the intelligence section.

439
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,031
What about the pictures?

440
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:37,409
They're getting them together now.
Said about five minutes.

441
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:40,078
Shaft's coming down. Send him right in.

442
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:58,222
Dina'll get you a bed made up.
Why don't you get some sleep, man?

443
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,643
Got some dead brothers laying out there.

444
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,395
And this ain't where I should be.

445
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:09,316
Till we find out why they're dead,
this is the only place for you to be!

446
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,235
You think like a white man!

447
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,903
You don't think! You want to get wasted?

448
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,530
If that's what it takes!

449
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:16,573
Marvin's sleeping.

450
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:25,499
I'll find out what I can and pick you up
in the morning.

451
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,919
If you think I'll owe you for this,
you're wrong.

452
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,629
You got nothing I want!

453
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:34,466
You can have the girls' room.

454
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:43,058
I got to go out. Got an extra key
so I don't wake you when I come back?

455
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,610
This'll open the downstairs door, too.

456
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,697
Watch your mouth.

457
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:58,240
I'll say anything I want.

458
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:01,743
Not in this house. Not here, you won't.

459
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,311
Have a chair.

460
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:29,438
I don't like your chair.

461
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,984
You gave me nothing, Vic.

462
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:38,447
You want to lock me up for manslaughter
'cause someone went out of my window...

463
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:40,699
...go ahead.

464
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:42,659
You got no deal.

465
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,915
I have nothing else to give you, then.
That's straight.

466
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,125
What do you got now?

467
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,752
One question first.

468
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:55,464
Anyone who could've identified those guys
with machine guns got wiped out!

469
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,465
Yeah?

470
00:45:56,548 --> 00:46:00,344
Five of Ben Buford's people
and probably the guy that fingered you.

471
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,931
Me? Are you sure it's me?

472
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:08,268
I'd be sure if I knew if the guys
were black or white.

473
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,521
I'd make it 80-20 they were after you.

474
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:13,065
But Bumpy could probably tell you that
for sure.

475
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,775
Just say what you got, man.

476
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:18,445
A few things that may fit.

477
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:24,326
Do you remember I told you that Bumpy
was doubling his crews up in Harlem?

478
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:25,244
So?

479
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,371
So, downtown we get some visitors.

480
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:32,125
Three guys from LA, two from Phoenix,
a guy from Decatur, Illinois...

481
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:36,505
...four guys from Philly.
Altogether about 15 that we're sure of.

482
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,507
Special guys, huh?

483
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,884
All suspected being guns for the Mafia.

484
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,636
Just got into town.

485
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,431
Most of them staying at a hotel
in the Village. Taking in the sights.

486
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,185
Is that it?

487
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,062
No, one thing more.

488
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,275
A couple of dudes from Harlem
go across to Jersey.

489
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:59,820
Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig.
They blew it.

490
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:01,822
They killed the guy's runner.

491
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:05,033
But the man says his runner
was in Florida on a fishing trip.

492
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,622
- Looks like war coming.
- It's a bad thing.

493
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,585
Mafia against Bumpy.
It's hood against hood, on the inside.

494
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,920
On the outside, it's black against white.

495
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:22,885
We could have tanks and troops
on Broadway if this thing breaks open.

496
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:26,263
Yeah, you got a point.

497
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,641
This is what some of our visitors look like.

498
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:32,853
Be a good time for it.

499
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:34,146
What? War?

500
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:36,565
Fishing down in Florida.

501
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,776
It might help if I knew
what Bumpy hired you for.

502
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,820
- Never said he did.
- He did.

503
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:45,824
It's against my ethics to say yes or no.

504
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:48,994
- He put you on the spot, Shaft.
- He did?

505
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,581
You're a very wise Caucasian, Vic.

506
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:57,836
I'll be here. If I'm not, call me at home.

507
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,547
That's a comfort.

508
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,643
- Hello?
- Hello, baby.

509
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:14,728
I waited up.

510
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,731
- Sorry, I can't make it.
- Got problems?

511
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,943
Yeah, I got a couple of them.

512
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:25,489
I was born black and I was born poor.

513
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:28,617
I love you.

514
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:31,662
Yeah, I know.

515
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:33,956
Take it easy.

516
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,721
Get up.

517
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,099
We've got a man to see.

518
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:12,744
See who that is, will you?

519
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,965
It's Shaft.

520
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:28,510
Let him in.

521
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:43,567
- I have an appointment with Bumpy.
- I know all about it.

522
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:48,906
I've got to see if you're clean
before you can see the man.

523
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,534
Better get yourself six more helpers then.

524
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,330
That's how it's done.

525
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,081
Who searches you?

526
00:49:58,332 --> 00:49:59,416
Nobody.

527
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,669
Then get the same cat to search us.

528
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:09,468
I've got to see if you got a gun on you
before you go in.

529
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:13,764
Tell Bumpy we were here. Come on, Ben.

530
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,766
You gonna let them walk now, Willy?

531
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:18,018
Bumpy'll have your tail.

532
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:23,899
Wait here, I'll call in to the man.

533
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,490
What do you want, Willy?

534
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:35,035
- Shaft's out here with some dude.
- Send them in.

535
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,871
He won't let me see if they are clean.

536
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:39,623
Let them in.

537
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,126
Go on, you heard him.

538
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:48,006
Listen, Snow White...

539
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:51,593
...we're gonna tangle sooner or later.

540
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,430
Did you hear what I said?

541
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,016
Why don't you stop playing with yourself?

542
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,769
You ain't gonna do shit!

543
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:32,718
You're a cagey spook, Bumpy.

544
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,345
You ride a tall horse, Mr. Shaft.

545
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:40,893
This is Ben Buford. Your little caper
cost him five friends last night.

546
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:45,481
- We'll take it out of your ass, pimp.
- You're pushing me a little far.

547
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,525
I found out some things, Bumpy.

548
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,614
You knew who grabbed your daughter,
and that it wasn't Ben or his people...

549
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:56,241
...when you laid all that jive on me
in my office.

550
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:59,828
I told you, there was no note.
I still don't know who has her.

551
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:01,455
You're lying, man!

552
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:04,583
Now, deal them up straight,
or don't deal them at all!

553
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,294
You grabbed the dope hustle up here
from the Mafia.

554
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:09,546
Made yourself some big bread.

555
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,882
Now the Mafia wants to move in on you.

556
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:20,599
So what?

557
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,601
So, the Mafia grabbed your daughter.

558
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:24,144
You knew it.

559
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:26,355
You knew it when you hired me.

560
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:30,692
Yeah.

561
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,821
You tried to snatch one for a trade.

562
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:36,615
But your flunky friends out there blew it.

563
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,370
They burned some kid. Missed the man
we wanted to grab for a trade.

564
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:45,290
Then you wanted to hustle old Shaft.

565
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:48,752
I hired you for a job. I conned you,
but I never lied to you.

566
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:50,838
My baby was grabbed.

567
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,883
You'll get her back. You bought that deal.
You're gonna live with it.

568
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,388
Not at these prices, baby.

569
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,273
I told you what it costs, it costs.

570
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,655
A lot of hyped-up black people give you
that money you're spending, pimp!

571
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:25,330
Don't you try to bullshit me, boy.
We're all on the hustle.

572
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:28,709
I sell broads and dope and numbers.

573
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:31,753
You sell crap and blue sky.
It's all the same game.

574
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:38,468
You knew the Mafia cats would come
after me, didn't you?

575
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:40,929
But it doesn't shake me up.

576
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,891
They made a good move
to take out my front man.

577
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,351
They'll probably try again. I would.

578
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:50,189
You been using me, Bumpy. Suckered me.

579
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,985
That's okay. We stood face to face.

580
00:53:56,528 --> 00:53:59,656
But, I want to know why you wanted me
to hook up with Ben.

581
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:08,415
'Cause you're gonna need an army
to get my baby back.

582
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,417
Ben's got one.

583
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:13,045
My people ain't worth a damn
outside of Harlem.

584
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:16,173
If you think I'd risk some of the brothers...

585
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:19,635
...just 'cause your daughter's black,
you're wrong, man.

586
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,930
We need money.

587
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,184
I got a lot of brothers and sisters in jail.

588
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:28,519
Set a price.

589
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,108
$10,000 a head.

590
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:41,281
That's what the honky government
pays a cat in the Army for insurance.

591
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:43,700
$10,000 a man.

592
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,204
That's our price.

593
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,501
All right.

594
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,843
You telling me you're willing to lay out
that kind of bread for Marcy?

595
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:03,971
Don't jive me, man.

596
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,682
I can always get more money.

597
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:09,601
I only got one baby.

598
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:14,314
That means you already owe him $50,000
for the men he lost last night.

599
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:16,650
All right.

600
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:22,156
We can get a lot of brothers and sisters
out of jail with that.

601
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:23,824
How many of his you'll need?

602
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:27,327
Depends on whether
the Mafia will take a ransom.

603
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:31,832
- They want Harlem, nothing less.
- It ain't yours to give. Not anymore.

604
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:33,959
Mine or not, it's not gonna be theirs.

605
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:37,504
All I gotta do is find out
where they've got her and bring her home.

606
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,006
That's it.

607
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:42,050
If he's worth $10,000, I'm worth $20,000.

608
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,512
You got it, COD.

609
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:48,056
Half now, half when I bring her home.

610
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:48,974
All!

611
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:50,893
Right now!

612
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,729
Half, that's the best I'll do.

613
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:57,107
You just been hustled, Bumpy.

614
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,359
Deliver the money tonight.

615
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,738
I'll have my boys drop it off.

616
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:07,576
At these prices, you blow it, Shaft,
I'm not gonna like it.

617
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:09,453
Not even a little bit.

618
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,749
I thought the money didn't matter to you.
Just getting your baby back.

619
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,587
Money always matters.

620
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:34,061
This is where I get off, man.

621
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:39,066
One thing we got to get straight.
If it comes to a fight, we do it my way.

622
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,444
For that kind of bread, the brothers'll play.

623
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:44,696
As long as you remember
we owe them five.

624
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,948
I said, my way!

625
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:49,701
I'll call you.

626
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,028
- Hey, man!
- Hey, Billy? Come here.

627
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,781
- Do me a favor.
- Sure.

628
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:32,035
- Go up to my place and turn on the...
- Hey, no, man. I've already turned on.

629
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:34,121
No, Billy, turn on the lights.

630
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:35,122
Lights.

631
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:37,166
- About two minutes, okay?
- Got it.

632
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,889
How are we doing, love?

633
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:37,309
That's nice. Don't make any trouble.

634
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,604
- Johnny!
- What do you say, Rollie?

635
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,815
Gorgeous coat!

636
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:48,195
How about letting me
take over the bar for a while?

637
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:50,864
There's nothing I wouldn't do for $20.

638
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:57,830
Have funzies.

639
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:24,857
You look ready.

640
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,860
Yeah, okay. Scotch and water, both.

641
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,658
On the house, gents.

642
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,125
And since the house is buying,
I'll have one.

643
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:53,594
To the big-hearted owner
of the No Name Bar.

644
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,888
Whether he knows he's generous or not.

645
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:03,437
That's all booze!

646
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:04,563
Right on.

647
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,774
All booze. One zillion percent.

648
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:21,330
Hold on.

649
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,210
Hold on.

650
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,925
No, he ain't here. Right.

651
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:37,971
Ho there, innkeeper?

652
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:44,269
Two gin and tonics, and a Virgin Mary...

653
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,021
...for moi.

654
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:48,565
I'm thirsty. Parched.

655
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:51,193
There's a girl over there...

656
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,904
...with the dark hair
and the groovy boobs...

657
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:58,200
You really turn her on, if you're interested.

658
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,911
I ain't dead.

659
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:06,250
Her friend, Valerie, says she's hot
for my body. I told her I was gay.

660
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:09,419
You know what she said?
She'd straighten me out.

661
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:12,172
That's what she said.

662
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:16,969
It's not enough that I'm lovely,
she wants me to play character parts.

663
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:22,266
The one with the titillating boobs
is named Linda.

664
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:37,656
Man can't walk on one leg.

665
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:46,081
Hate drinking alone.

666
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:18,697
Vic, private line.

667
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:23,744
Hey, sweet baby?

668
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,454
This is your lover man.

669
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,165
Who the hell is this?

670
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,501
Two sweet guesses.

671
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:33,879
That you, Shaft?

672
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:38,383
You bet your lovely self it is.
And I'm ready. Can you dig it?

673
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,011
Got troubles?

674
01:02:42,638 --> 01:02:44,806
- I got what you want.
- Where are you?

675
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,642
No Name Bar in the Village.

676
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:48,435
On Jane Street.

677
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,565
- What do you want me to do?
- Haul your beautiful self down here.

678
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:54,900
How many are there?

679
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:57,110
About two.

680
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:00,906
I'll close up and we'll go over to my pad.

681
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,409
You walk in that front door,
I'll close up right now.

682
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:10,541
- I'll have a car there in a few seconds.
- That's what I want to hear.

683
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:21,134
A lot of loose stuff around here?

684
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:26,598
All a man can handle, deacon.

685
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:33,230
What are you looking at?

686
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:38,986
Get lost.

687
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:43,782
Go do something.

688
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:47,161
Where are my manners?

689
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:50,455
I didn't even introduce myself
to you gentlemen.

690
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:54,585
My name is John Shaft.

691
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:56,545
Freeze!

692
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,397
Throw me a towel.

693
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:19,109
There's two of them.
We're generous around here.

694
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,497
It's not so bad.

695
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:38,629
It's a nice pad you got here.

696
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:42,508
I'm going upstairs to take a shower.
I'll be right back.

697
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:52,976
I just couldn't wait.

698
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:22,756
- What do you say, Vic?
- 'Morning.

699
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:26,927
Both of them had guns,
licenses to carry them.

700
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:30,222
"Jewelry couriers," the licenses say.

701
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:32,349
Detroit people.

702
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:36,979
- Will you turn them loose?
- I have no choice.

703
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,815
They'll leave town.

704
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:42,734
You'll have strangers looking for you,
not them.

705
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:45,571
Can I have a private talk with them?

706
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:49,700
What you'll do to poor Carmen now?
Give him cancer?

707
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:52,953
You busted his head, settle.

708
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:57,499
I want to find out his views
on urban renewal.

709
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:02,504
All right.

710
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:30,449
I'm speaking for Bumpy Jonas.

711
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:33,076
He wants to be sure his daughter's okay.

712
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:38,165
My word is all he'll take.
No phone calls and no letters from her.

713
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:40,626
I've got to see her.

714
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:44,129
Then maybe he'll deal.

715
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:48,300
Nothing I want to say in this rat hole.

716
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:52,429
- People might be listening.
- That's a risk we'll have to take.

717
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:56,058
Now give me a number
so I can let you know where I'll be.

718
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:59,603
I'll call you at 12:30 sharp!

719
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:03,398
And meet you at 12:45
somewhere in the Village.

720
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,621
Hey, baby?

721
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:03,083
- Come here.
- Party's over.

722
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,793
You got to split.

723
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:08,547
Some other time.
Same feeling, same place.

724
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:11,550
Right now I've got to take care
of some business.

725
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:35,699
Put Ben on.

726
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,910
He's asleep, who wants him?

727
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:40,496
Wake him up, it's John Shaft.

728
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,249
You're really great in the sack, but...

729
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,669
...you're pretty shitty afterwards.

730
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,967
I'm trying to take care of some business.

731
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,262
Come on!

732
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:01,475
I need two good men. Are you ready?

733
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:02,476
Yeah.

734
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,311
They'd better be tough.

735
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:08,524
Baby, please close the door.

736
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,402
Close it yourself, Shitty.

737
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:19,326
- Tell me where and when.
- At Caf Reggio in the Village.

738
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:21,203
- Know where it is?
- I'll find it.

739
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,747
12:30. Five minutes late would be too late.

740
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,666
I'll be there. 'Bye.

741
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,918
It's Vic Androzzi.

742
01:10:15,257 --> 01:10:17,092
What the hell are you doing here?

743
01:10:21,722 --> 01:10:23,432
I got no time for chats.

744
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:39,615
You had time for a chat with Carmen
and Patsy in my office this morning.

745
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:48,123
You got me in one hell of a mess.

746
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:53,670
- Did you have the room bugged?
- No, not me.

747
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:56,590
Me? I could turn the other way.

748
01:10:57,508 --> 01:10:59,384
Not hear what I heard.

749
01:11:01,512 --> 01:11:04,556
It's that big-eared Captain I got
who was listening.

750
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:10,479
He thinks he heard you discussing
a kidnapping.

751
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:14,733
He thinks the Mafia's involved.

752
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,947
And he knows Bumpy Jonas is involved.

753
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,782
Tell him to ask Bumpy then.

754
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:23,575
Yeah, I did.

755
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:25,953
But he wants to ask you.

756
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:27,955
Now. At the station.

757
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:31,667
Lousy timing, right?

758
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,502
Gonna take me in?

759
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:36,755
I will if I find you.

760
01:11:38,632 --> 01:11:39,675
Are you home?

761
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:41,343
Hell, no.

762
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:44,763
That's too bad.

763
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:53,230
Call me when you get home.

764
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:55,274
I will.

765
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:03,073
"Close it yourself, Shitty."

766
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:31,518
This is Shaft. Now get this straight!

767
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:36,190
I'll be at Caf Reggio
on McDougall street at 12:45.

768
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:40,235
- Got it?
- Reggio, 12:45.

769
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:41,195
Right.

770
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:40,295
Menu?

771
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:42,172
Espresso.

772
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,343
Don't you want a sandwich
or something with it?

773
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:48,720
Just espresso.

774
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,534
I hope you don't like lemon peel.

775
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,120
Let it go.

776
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:16,790
I think you like it. I'll go get you some.

777
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,127
I always forget the lemon peel.

778
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:55,078
I'm looking for a nigger named John Shaft.

779
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,333
You just found him, wop!

780
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:03,086
Sit down.

781
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:05,964
I have to take you to visit a lady.
Come on.

782
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:11,011
I haven't finished my espresso.

783
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:14,014
Why don't you have some?

784
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:19,436
Maybe they'll put a little garlic in it,
if you're nice.

785
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,443
No, thanks. But you go ahead.

786
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:32,908
We've even got time for you
to have your soul food.

787
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:37,913
Espresso?

788
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:40,541
No, thanks.

789
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:45,087
Keep it.

790
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,381
Thanks, baby.

791
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:02,312
Let's go.

792
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:40,744
Come on.

793
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:14,778
After you, man.

794
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,281
You stay here.

795
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:03,785
You get around the back, keep an eye
on the alley door. Stay out of sight.

796
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,871
What if they come out our way?

797
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:09,625
You follow them. Remmy,
you come back for me. Now move it!

798
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:26,099
No noise. Now, answer me straight.

799
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:29,311
No lies and no con.

800
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:32,564
How many men you got in there with her?

801
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:33,649
Two.

802
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:36,318
Okay.

803
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:40,989
When I tell you, you open that door like
this gun was about to blow your head off.

804
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:44,409
No signal or you're gone. Got it?

805
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:46,537
Yeah.

806
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:50,707
Gin!

807
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:51,917
Open it.

808
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,718
Turn her loose or he goes.

809
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:06,181
- Tell them to turn her loose.
- He won't.

810
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,726
He won't shoot, Marcy, come here.

811
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:12,563
There's nothing you can do, Shaft.

812
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:16,358
Except go back to Harlem
and tell Bumpy his little girl is fine.

813
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:19,444
- When I leave, she leaves with me.
- No way, Shaft.

814
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:22,364
She's our ace. You never give up your ace.

815
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,324
Maybe you're right.

816
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:27,703
I should take you uptown
and turn you over to Bumpy.

817
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:31,373
Change your mind, you can walk right now.

818
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:35,544
You try to take the girl or me along,
you're dead.

819
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:38,922
You trying to tell me they'd blow you away
to get me?

820
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:40,465
That's right.

821
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:49,892
I halfway believe you. But, you're my ace,
so I got to call you.

822
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:06,950
The only thing that's keeping you alive
right now is...

823
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:10,370
...you got to be fit enough
to go tell that black punk in Harlem...

824
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:13,957
...that he's got 24 hours to deal
or he's got a dead daughter!

825
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:15,167
And a war!

826
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:16,877
You hear me?

827
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,673
Come on, let's go!

828
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:23,842
Let's go!

829
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:32,476
Back door.

830
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,847
Come on.

831
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:13,976
Come on!

832
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:26,280
You all right? Come on.

833
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,073
Come on.

834
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:29,575
You all right?

835
01:22:31,702 --> 01:22:33,328
Get me up out of here.

836
01:22:34,413 --> 01:22:37,291
The place'll be stinking with cops
in a minute.

837
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:42,379
Grab those guns. Let's get out of here.

838
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:55,225
- Ellie! Ellie, open up!
- Yes!

839
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,980
My God! What happened?

840
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:02,149
He's been shot.

841
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:07,112
Put him on the couch.

842
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:10,782
Didn't want to tell you on the phone.

843
01:23:22,753 --> 01:23:24,421
Ellie, call Sam.

844
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:27,966
- You need a real doctor, baby.
- I said, call Sam.

845
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:43,440
Easy.

846
01:23:52,324 --> 01:23:53,367
Blade.

847
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,119
Get on the phone.

848
01:23:56,787 --> 01:24:00,123
We gonna need some more brothers.
With guns this time.

849
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:08,006
Bumpy'll handle the transportation.

850
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,907
Had to bring you to, Johnny.

851
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:37,286
Can't fix anything else,
till you tell me where you hurt.

852
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:40,038
Wall to wall, Sam.

853
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:44,251
Ellie, give me that phone.

854
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:47,504
- Get those boys?
- Got eight.

855
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:51,717
Know where they took her?

856
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,304
One of the brothers tailed them.
He's watching the place now.

857
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,389
What about the back exit?

858
01:24:57,723 --> 01:25:00,142
Everything's cool, baby. Don't worry.

859
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,394
Did you run into a train?

860
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:07,107
Tight as you can get it.
I got to get up soon as you're done.

861
01:25:12,154 --> 01:25:14,573
Damn, those were some tough white boys.

862
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,576
You're gonna have one hell of a time.

863
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:20,037
Got a bad sprain on that right wrist.

864
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:21,121
Tape it.

865
01:25:21,205 --> 01:25:24,958
I did, damn it. What do you think I am,
an amateur?

866
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:28,962
Too good of a job, Sam.
I didn't even feel it.

867
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:47,648
Wrong number.

868
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:50,776
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.
I saw Marcy.

869
01:25:51,318 --> 01:25:52,736
Is she all right?

870
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:55,072
Scared to death, but okay.

871
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,575
I need three cabs,
on the corner of Ninth and Washington.

872
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:02,162
- To pick up some of Ben's people.
- How soon?

873
01:26:02,246 --> 01:26:03,705
Now, man, now!

874
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:22,516
Okay, you two! Outside! Move, move!

875
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:24,726
Let's go!

876
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:28,689
Tie them up!

877
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:32,901
All right, where are the uniforms?

878
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,507
- Who's that?
- The night janitor. He's okay.

879
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:59,136
Use him to find out
which room they got her in.

880
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:03,348
- Getting it together?
- Yeah, right on.

881
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:15,944
Beautiful.

882
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,913
Just beautiful.

883
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,541
Jerry, how are you doing, baby?

884
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:34,963
Hey, boy?

885
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:41,887
Send up two coffees and a Coke.

886
01:27:43,138 --> 01:27:44,556
Glass or a straw?

887
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:47,142
For the Coke.

888
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:48,852
Make it a straw.

889
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:54,107
Straw?

890
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:56,318
You heard me, straw.

891
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,863
Right.

892
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:04,159
You're a shrewd cat, Shaft.

893
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:07,246
You and your boys blow it
and I'll be one dead cat!

894
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:10,457
You all know the plan. No mistakes.

895
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:13,502
Let's go.

896
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:51,039
There you are, sir.
Two coffees, a Coke and a straw.

897
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,250
- Want me to take it in?
- Whoa.

898
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:57,546
Right.

899
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,388
Hey, thank you!

900
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:09,766
- I'll be seeing you.
- Okay.

901
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:17,918
Shut up!

902
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:24,424
- What do you guys want?
- Your coat.

903
01:30:53,912 --> 01:30:55,330
Rope and harness.

904
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,016
Go ahead down.

905
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:48,926
Did you hear anything?

906
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:19,349
This damn thing won't burn hot enough.

907
01:33:19,433 --> 01:33:22,102
You got something else
in there that'll burn?

908
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:40,120
It's gin, man.

909
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:46,502
What else you got?

910
01:33:50,672 --> 01:33:51,757
Gasoline.

911
01:34:03,018 --> 01:34:04,061
Come on!

912
01:34:36,135 --> 01:34:37,678
Give me a cigarette.

913
01:34:48,814 --> 01:34:50,732
- You know what to do?
- Yeah.

914
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:26,054
Let's get out of here!

915
01:37:52,706 --> 01:37:53,749
Come on!

916
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:56,376
Let's go!

917
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:49,721
Androzzi, here.

918
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:53,642
- Vic, your case just busted wide open.
- So close it for me.

919
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:55,894
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.

920
01:38:56,311 --> 01:38:59,439
"You'll have to close it yourself, Shitty! "
