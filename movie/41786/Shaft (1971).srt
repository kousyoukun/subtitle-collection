00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,406
-去你的！      -別擋路！
{\fs12}-Up yours!   -Get out of the way!{\r}

2
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,713
錶不錯吧，兄弟？
{\fs12}Fine time piece, brother?{\r}

3
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:34,706
再見
{\fs12}Goodbye.{\r}

4
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:28,860
{\fs12}"Who's the black private dick
that's a sex machine to all the chicks?{\r}

5
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,649
{\fs12}"Shaft{\r}

6
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:32,530

{\fs12}"Damn right{\r}

7
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:45,045
{\fs12}"Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?{\r}

8
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,709
{\fs12}"Shaft{\r}

9
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,800
{\fs12}"Can you dig it?{\r}

10
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,648
{\fs12}"Who's the cat that won't cop out
when there's danger all about?{\r}

11
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:02,735
{\fs12}"Shaft{\r}

12
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,278
{\fs12}"Right on{\r}

13
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,694
{\fs12}"They say this cat is a bad mother{\r}

14
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,867
{\fs12}"Shut your mouth{\r}

15
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,331
{\fs12}"I'm talking about Shaft{\r}

16
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,076
{\fs12}"Then we can dig it{\r}

17
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,250
{\fs12}"He's a complicated man{\r}

18
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,334
{\fs12}"No one understands him{\r}

19
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,083
{\fs12}"But his woman{\r}

20
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,586
{\fs12}"John Shaft"{\r}

21
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,553
發生了什麼事，馬蒂？
{\fs12}What's happening, Marty?{\r}

22
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,094
同樣是六啊七啊的，謝夫特
{\fs12}Same old sixes and sevens, Shaft.{\r}

23
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:28,312
10分鐘前，有兩個人在找你
{\fs12}Two guys were looking for you like 10 minutes ago.{\r}

24
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,767
哈林區來的？
{\fs12}Harlem cats?{\r}

25
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:34,645
我哪知道？在我看來每個人長得都一樣
{\fs12}How the hell should I know? Everybody looks the same to me.{\r}

26
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:38,074
輕鬆點，馬蒂
{\fs12}Take it easy, Marty.{\r}

27
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:39,903
保重，謝夫特
{\fs12}Take care, Shaft.{\r}

28
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,752
謝了，兄弟
{\fs12}Thanks, brother.{\r}

29
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,342
今天早上糖放太多了
{\fs12}Too much sugar this morning.{\r}

30
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,673
寶貝，那就別喝
{\fs12}Then don't drink it, baby.{\r}

31
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:37,645
幾個來自郊區的傢伙正在找你
{\fs12}A couple of dudes from uptown looking for you.{\r}

32
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,179
認識他們嗎？
{\fs12}Know them?{\r}

33
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,473
不知道姓名
{\fs12}Not by name.{\r}

34
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:46,527
剛開張時，在郊區附近見過他們
{\fs12}Seen them around uptown. Come in here when I was opening up.{\r}

35
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:49,317
他們問起 在哪裡可以找到你
{\fs12}Asked where they could find you.{\r}

36
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:51,453
他們長什麼樣子？
{\fs12}What did they look like?{\r}

37
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,788
一個穿著時髦的格子外套，另一個很新潮
{\fs12}One was wearing a funky plaid coat. Other one was sharp.{\r}

38
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:59,495
50元的鞋子。黑外套，灰色喇叭褲
{\fs12}$50 shoes. Black coat, gray flares.{\r}

39
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,965
-就這些？    -他們身上有傢伙
{\fs12}-Is that all?     -They had heat on them.{\r}

40
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:07,381
穿格子外套的雙手插著口袋
{\fs12}The one in the plaid coat had his hands in his pocket.{\r}

41
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,597
緊拉著他的外套，瞭了嗎？
{\fs12}Pulled his coat tight, you dig?{\r}

42
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:13,263
他腰帶上有沉甸甸的鐵器
{\fs12}Had some heavy iron in his belt.{\r}

43
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:16,395
你左腳的鞋子 腳趾的部位有磨損
{\fs12}You got a scuff on the toe of this left shoe.{\r}

44
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,826
幾點了，湯姆？
{\fs12}What time you got, Tom?{\r}

45
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:26,403
8:16

46
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,839
停在擦鞋店的前面，他常在那裡閒逛
{\fs12}Pull over in front of that shoe-shine parlor. He usually hangs out there.{\r}

47
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,045
好
{\fs12}Okay.{\r}

48
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,887
-要我進去嗎？   -不，我們等一下
{\fs12}-You want me to go in?   -No. We'll wait.{\r}

49
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:52,687
讓自己的鞋子發亮，保證你在外事業成功
{\fs12}Got yourself a nice shine. You can go out and make something of yourself, man.{\r}

50
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:58,820
跟你一樣變有錢和變胖？我們有話直說，寶貝
{\fs12}Go out and get rich and fat like you? We're straight, baby.{\r}

51
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,327
有時間嗎，謝夫特？
{\fs12}Got a minute, Shaft?{\r}

52
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:09,458
維克，色情圖片我沒興趣。別煩我
{\fs12}Got no use for no dirty postcards, Vic. Get off my back.{\r}

53
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,548
我只是想和你談談。
{\fs12}I just want to talk to you.{\r}

54
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:14,006
打電話給我，你知道我的號碼。
{\fs12}Call me up. You know my number.{\r}

55
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:20,216
我請你一杯咖啡。去公園坐一分鐘？
{\fs12}Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee. Go sit in the park a minute?{\r}

56
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:23,478
不行。要說就在這裡說！
{\fs12}Hell, no. Just tell me what you got to say right here!{\r}

57
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,894
湯姆，拿兩支雪茄來。你抽哪個牌子？
{\fs12}Tom, go get us two cigars. What kind do you smoke?{\r}

58
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,188
想說什麼就說吧
{\fs12}Just say what you've got to say.{\r}

59
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,489
來兩枝艾爾加西亞
{\fs12}Get us a couple of El Garcia's.{\r}

60
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,125
看，我遲到了
{\fs12}Look, I'm late.{\r}

61
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,245
你想交給我什麼？
{\fs12}What are you trying to lay on me?{\r}

62
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,044
只是愛，謝夫特。只有愛和同情。
{\fs12}Just love, Shaft. Nothing but love and sympathy.{\r}

63
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:49,301
我們互不相欠。去吧，那個心領了
{\fs12}Then we're even. Go on, get on with it.{\r}

64
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,474
我還以為你可能知道 我想知道的事
{\fs12}I thought you might know something I want to know.{\r}

65
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:55,851
似乎在郊區發出沉悶的隆隆之聲
{\fs12}Seems there's been a lot of low, quiet rumbles going on uptown.{\r}

66
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:59,805
我們的人只聞其聲，卻不解其意
{\fs12}Our people have been able to pick up the sounds of it, but not words.{\r}

67
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:03,105
這是因為我們黑人談話一向含糊，隊長
{\fs12}That's 'cause us black folk talk mush mouth, Lieutenant.{\r}

68
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:06,532
我以為我們能解決
{\fs12}I thought we'd get to it.{\r}

69
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:10,402
沒錯。但要我去打探。我只會說“去你的，寶貝”
{\fs12}We did. But, you want me to pigeon. I just said, "Up yours, baby."{\r}

70
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,076
為什麼今天早上 哈林區兩個傢伙來到鬧區...
{\fs12}How come two cats from Harlem came downtown this morning...{\r}

71
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,961
...要找約翰.謝夫特？
{\fs12}...looking for John Shaft?{\r}

72
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:23,292
他們是黑人弟兄，他們來以便讓我教他們握手
{\fs12}They're soul brothers. They came down so I could teach them the handshake.{\r}

73
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:26,342
他們找到你了？
{\fs12}They find you?{\r}

74
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,259
當然，我又沒躲起來
{\fs12}Of course, I wasn't hiding.{\r}

75
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:33,186
如果一有消息，就打個電話給我，我還在第38區
{\fs12}If you find out anything, give me a call. I'm still at the 38th Precinct.{\r}

76
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:35,437
好吧
{\fs12}Right on.{\r}

77
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,734
你到底要去哪裡？
{\fs12}Where the hell are you going?{\r}

78
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:42,570
去泡妞。你到底要去哪兒？
{\fs12}To get laid. Where the hell are you going?{\r}

79
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,366
那男孩的嘴巴太賤了
{\fs12}That boy's got a lot of mouth on him.{\r}

80
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,291
這男孩也夠種，他言出必行
{\fs12}The boy's man enough to back it up, too.{\r}

81
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,304
他告訴你什麼？
{\fs12}What did he tell you?{\r}

82
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:01,796
沒有
{\fs12}Nothing.{\r}

83
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,051
還得依賴那種人
{\fs12}Got to lean on that kind.{\r}

84
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:06,929
你不必依賴那種人
{\fs12}You don't lean on that kind.{\r}

85
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:12,353
給我一包口香糖
{\fs12}Give me a package of gum.{\r}

86
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,535
發出聲響，我就砍了你。後退
{\fs12}Make a noise, I'll cut you. Back up.{\r}

87
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:57,493
-謝夫特先生，有什麼不對嗎？   -這朋友病了
{\fs12}-Something wrong, Mr. Shaft?   -Sick friend here.{\r}

88
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,540
吉姆，能幫我們按個電梯嗎？
{\fs12}Jim, can you get us a car up?{\r}

89
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,633
這我拿走了
{\fs12}I'll take that.{\r}

90
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:08,846
現在，冷靜，老兄
{\fs12}Now, be cool, man.{\r}

91
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:22,021
你的搭檔在哪裡？
{\fs12}Where is your partner?{\r}

92
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,661
打開門。
{\fs12}Open the door.{\r}

93
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:22,434
給你半分鐘 說出你到底要我幹嘛
{\fs12}You've got about a half a minute to tell me what the hell you want with me.{\r}

94
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,468
警察會問你為什麼把那婊子扔出窗外
{\fs12}The police will ask why you threw that son of a bitch out the window.{\r}

95
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,018
是死是活 他們都會找到你。你他媽說不說？
{\fs12}They can find you dead or alive. Now, what's your goddamn story?{\r}

96
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,108
顛仔...
{\fs12}Bumpy...{\r}

97
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:36,731
顛仔說要把你帶去郊區
{\fs12}Bumpy says to bring you uptown.{\r}

98
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:39,237
他要你來搞我嗎？
{\fs12}Did he tell you to mess me up?{\r}

99
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,411
我是來帶你的
{\fs12}I was to bring you.{\r}

100
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:49,883
這沒道理
{\fs12}It doesn't make sense.{\r}

101
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:52,969
你到了辦公室，帶著一個生病的朋友
{\fs12}You arrive at your office. You have a sick friend with you.{\r}

102
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:56,341
突然，另一個你不認識的人衝上來，就打起架了
{\fs12}Suddenly, another man you don't know rushes up and a fight starts.{\r}

103
00:11:56,477 --> 00:11:59,561
你生病的朋友飛出窗外。為什麼，謝夫特先生？
{\fs12}Your sick friend goes out the window. Why, Mr. Shaft?{\r}

104
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:03,519
去問那個先動手打架的人，賴柏維茲先生
{\fs12}Ask the man who started the fight, Mr. Leibowitz.{\r}

105
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:06,315
你朋友，你只知道他叫“德仔”嗎？
{\fs12}Your friend, the only name you know him by is "Tex"?{\r}

106
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:08,481
-不知姓氏？        -沒錯
{\fs12}-No last name?    -That's right.{\r}

107
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:09,901
我不相信，謝夫特
{\fs12}I don't buy that, Shaft.{\r}

108
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:13,907
你所知的應不止這些。比如說，為什麼打架了
{\fs12}I think you know more than that. Why the fight started, for instance.{\r}

109
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:17,082
推測和如何證實，這是兩回事
{\fs12}What you think and what you can prove are two different bags.{\r}

110
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:23,458
你的朋友都帶這種武器晃來晃去嗎？
{\fs12}All your friends walk around with weapons like that?{\r}

111
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,998
看情況
{\fs12}That depends.{\r}

112
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:29,180
我的黑人朋友不再帶著兔腳閒逛了
{\fs12}My Negro friends don't walk around with rabbits' feet no more.{\r}

113
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:32,470
別跟我耍聰明。我有個簡單的方法
{\fs12}Don't get wise with me. There's a simple way for me to go.{\r}

114
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:36,387
-我會把你關起來！   -我會告你濫捕
{\fs12}-I'll put your goddamn ass in! 
-I'll sue your goddamn ass for false arrest.{\r}

115
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:39,567
那個人摔出去了，你要我相信你的說法？
{\fs12}You want me to believe the man fell out the way you said he did?{\r}

116
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:43,651
-我看起來像個傻瓜嗎？   -別問我，我不會當面說
{\fs12}-What do I look like? Some kind of klutz?
-Don't ask, and I won't tell you.{\r}

117
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:46,197
您的執照是市政府和州政府核發的
{\fs12}You're licensed by the city and the state.{\r}

118
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:49,987
持照人在涉及重大案件下，都不該核發執照
{\fs12}No one licensed can afford to be a wise ass where a felony case is involved.{\r}

119
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,248
你是說我會失去執照嗎？
{\fs12}Are you suggesting I'd lose my license?{\r}

120
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:55,502
對極了！你最好相信並對我坦承！
{\fs12}You are damn right I am! You better believe it and level with me!{\r}

121
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:59,543
威脅我的生計就是侵犯了我權利，不是嗎？
{\fs12}Threatening my livelihood is a violation of my rights, isn't it?{\r}

122
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,297
拜倫...
{\fs12}Byron...{\r}

123
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,345
讓我私下跟他談談
{\fs12}Let me have a talk with him in private.{\r}

124
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:15,227
你要去訊問一個攻擊者
{\fs12}You got an assailant to interview.{\r}

125
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:17,688
去吧，我們談過後我會去找你
{\fs12}Start that and I'll join after we talk.{\r}

126
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:21,482
連你也在呼攏我，這件事臭掉了
{\fs12}I think you are b. s.-ing me, too. This thing stinks.{\r}

127
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:42,184
也許是他不喜歡 你所教的握手方式
{\fs12}Maybe he didn't like the handshake you taught him.{\r}

128
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,023
這次亂子 你心知肚明脫不了關係吧？
{\fs12}You know you can get your rump in a sling for this mess?{\r}

129
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,027
-遲滯，麻煩不少   -維克，你會救我的
{\fs12}-Static, a lot of hassle.  -You'll save me, Vic.{\r}

130
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:52,441
我可以試試
{\fs12}Well, I can try.{\r}

131
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,528
假如？
{\fs12}If?{\r}

132
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,444
禮尚往來
{\fs12}One hand washes the other.{\r}

133
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:01,244
世界所有的麻煩 都別想讓我替警察唱歌
{\fs12}All the hassle in the world wouldn't make me sing a song to the police.{\r}

134
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,206
不可能，寶貝
{\fs12}No way, baby.{\r}

135
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:08,131
被你扔出窗外的那隻貓 是顛仔.喬納斯的奴才
{\fs12}That cat you threw out the window was a flunky for Bumpy Jonas.{\r}

136
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,591
隊長，我沒有把貓扔出窗外
{\fs12}I didn't throw no cat out no window, Lieutenant.{\r}

137
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,507
顛仔不會高興的
{\fs12}Bumpy isn't gonna like it.{\r}

138
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:17,302
我不在乎他高不高興！你激我幹嘛？
{\fs12}I don't care what he likes! What the hell are you pumping me for?{\r}

139
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,637
兩個星期前，我們開始聽到隆隆之聲
{\fs12}Two weeks ago we started picking up rumbles.{\r}

140
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,234
-你說過了    -我們知道那不是黑豹幫
{\fs12}-You already said that.   -We know it's not the Panthers.{\r}

141
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,281
或是新少主幫。但是，有某事在喧騰
{\fs12}Or the Young Lords. But, something's on the boil.{\r}

142
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,200
我想知道這是什麼...
{\fs12}I want to know what it is...{\r}

143
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,579
...在我們需要一台新機器來計算屍體之前
{\fs12}...before we need an adding machine to count the bodies.{\r}

144
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,742
顛仔想找你去做某件事
{\fs12}Bumpy wants you for something.{\r}

145
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:40,163
他知道發生了什麼事，這就是我想知道的
{\fs12}He knows what's going on. And that's what I want to know.{\r}

146
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:42,298
不是誰，而是什麼事
{\fs12}Not who, just what.{\r}

147
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:47,674
看到你如此關心弱勢民族，讓我黑人的心變暖了
{\fs12}It warms my black heart to see you so concerned about us minority folks.{\r}

148
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:52,301
拜託，謝夫特。跟我扯黑人這種狗屁幹嘛？
{\fs12}Come on, Shaft. What is it with this black shit?{\r}

149
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:57,024
你又沒那麼黑
{\fs12}You ain't so black.{\r}

150
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:01,062
寶貝，你又沒那麼白
{\fs12}And you ain't so white, baby.{\r}

151
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,065
好
{\fs12}All right.{\r}

152
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,990
你想玩你的黑色重口味
{\fs12}You want to play your super heavy black number.{\r}

153
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,501
我就玩我的
{\fs12}I'm gonna play mine.{\r}

154
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:18,003
以目前我們擁有的事證，足以定你的罪！
{\fs12}We can nail your tail for manslaughter with what we've got on you right now!{\r}

155
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:22,716
你可以戲弄賴柏維茲，但你懂法律，你可能會被起訴
{\fs12}You can waltz Leibowitz, but you know the law. You could be charged.{\r}

156
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:24,975
起訴，隊長
{\fs12}Charged, Lieutenant.{\r}

157
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:27,468
是的，而你的執照將被停用
{\fs12}Yeah, but your license'll be suspended.{\r}

158
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,350
你將失業六個月
{\fs12}You'll be out of business for six months.{\r}

159
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,689
你想被停業六個月？
{\fs12}You want to be out of business for six months?{\r}

160
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:36,114
走在街上
{\fs12}Out on the street.{\r}

161
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,606
沒有槍支許可證，六個月！
{\fs12}No gun permit. Six months!{\r}

162
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:43,243
一切都不順的時候，何況顛仔正在找你？
{\fs12}With Bumpy looking for you when all hell's about to break loose?{\r}

163
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:44,706
你想要 就會如願以償
{\fs12}You want it, you got it.{\r}

164
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:48,245
隊長，你嚇死我了
{\fs12}You scare me to death, Lieutenant.{\r}

165
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,288
你自找麻煩，不僅自己受害還會血洗哈林區
{\fs12}You're buying trouble not only for yourself, but a blood bath up in Harlem.{\r}

166
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,333
你想要那樣？
{\fs12}You want that?{\r}

167
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,055
我想問你的，只是我想知道發生了什麼！
{\fs12}All I'm asking you is to let me know what's going on!{\r}

168
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,599
不用名字跟地點，只要說什麼事！
{\fs12}No names, no places, just what!{\r}

169
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,808
我不是要你出賣誰
{\fs12}I'm not asking you to sell out.{\r}

170
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:11,604
告訴我遊戲的名稱，讓我知道規則
{\fs12}Tell me the name of the game, so I know the rules.{\r}

171
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,176
我考慮看看
{\fs12}I'll think about it.{\r}

172
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,430
好吧，現在我還能接受
{\fs12}All right, I'll settle for that now.{\r}

173
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,970
那替你爭取48個小時的自由，然後我們再談
{\fs12}That buys you 48 hours on the street, and then we're gonna talk again.{\r}

174
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:41,810
你有顛仔的私人電話號碼？
{\fs12}You got the number of Bumpy's private phone?{\r}

175
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:45,311
好
{\fs12}All right.{\r}

176
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,441
去吧，賴柏維茲由我來搞定
{\fs12}Take off. I'll see to Leibowitz.{\r}

177
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:51,949
好吧
{\fs12}Right on.{\r}

178
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:55,161
我會去找你
{\fs12}I'll see you.{\r}

179
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,924
瞧瞧那個
{\fs12}Look at that.{\r}

180
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,888
-打錯了    -別呼嚨我，這號碼沒錯
{\fs12}-Wrong number.   -Don't bull me, I got the right number.{\r}

181
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,390
我是謝夫特
{\fs12}This is Shaft.{\r}

182
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:50,141
你怎麼有這支號碼？
{\fs12}How did you get this number?{\r}

183
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,904
在他媽地鐵裡的廁所牆上
{\fs12}Off a bathroom wall in the goddamn subway.{\r}

184
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,988
我在找你
{\fs12}I'm looking for you.{\r}

185
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,901
我有辦公室的
{\fs12}I've got an office.{\r}

186
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:10,537
這是你的
{\fs12}Here you are.{\r}

187
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:11,956
謝謝
{\fs12}Thanks.{\r}

188
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:15,053
請給我一袋栗子。今天好冷，是吧？
{\fs12}Bag of chestnuts, please. Cold as hell today, huh?{\r}

189
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:17,803
是啊。好栗子
{\fs12}Yeah, yeah. Good chestnuts.{\r}

190
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:20,967
多少？
{\fs12}How much?{\r}

191
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:22,094
兩分錢
{\fs12}Two bits.{\r}

192
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,560
-給你。輕鬆點       -謝謝
{\fs12}-Here you go. Take it easy.   -Thanks.{\r}

193
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:25,599
嘿，計程車！
{\fs12}Hey, taxi!{\r}

194
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,616
到底是什麼事？
{\fs12}What the hell is this?{\r}

195
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:34,947
你的白媽媽！
{\fs12}You white mother!{\r}

196
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,738
計程車!計程車!
{\fs12}Taxi! Taxi!{\r}

197
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:26,593
小子說他會在，他就應該在
{\fs12}Cat say he gonna be here, he should be here.{\r}

198
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:27,887
打開
{\fs12}Open it up.{\r}

199
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,629
小子說他會在這裡...
{\fs12}Cat say he gonna be here...{\r}

200
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:01,759
...而卻沒有
{\fs12}...and he ain't.{\r}

201
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,095
這不應該的，老大
{\fs12}It ain't right, Boss.{\r}

202
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,060
我們等一下
{\fs12}We'll wait.{\r}

203
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:14,148
你聽了他的廢話...
{\fs12}You take crap off of him...{\r}

204
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:16,483
...他會給你更多廢話
{\fs12}...he'll give you more crap.{\r}

205
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:19,032
我們等一下
{\fs12}We'll wait.{\r}

206
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:21,823
這算是什麼狗屁...
{\fs12}That's some cold shit...{\r}

207
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:25,914
...把我的人勒羅伊拋出窗外
{\fs12}...throwing my man, Leroy, out the window.{\r}

208
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,957
把我的人抓起來，就這樣他媽的扔出窗戶
{\fs12}Just picked my man up, and threw him out the goddamned window.{\r}

209
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:36,172
還要我們站在一邊等著說謝謝
{\fs12}Got us standing around and waiting to say thank you.{\r}

210
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,183
很高興你自己進來了，顛仔
{\fs12}Glad you let yourself in, Bumpy.{\r}

211
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,773
免得你在大廳閒逛，壞了我的名聲
{\fs12}Give me a bad name, have you hanging around in the hall.{\r}

212
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,408
嘿...
{\fs12}Look...{\r}

213
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:53,951
如果下次那個人來這裡...
{\fs12}If the man ever comes down here...{\r}

214
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:56,371
...再來見你...
{\fs12}...again to see you...{\r}

215
00:20:57,084 --> 00:20:59,242
...確認你一定會在這裡
{\fs12}...you make sure you be here.{\r}

216
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,410
乖乖等著
{\fs12}Waiting.{\r}

217
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:03,875
你佔了我的位子
{\fs12}You're in my chair.{\r}

218
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,567
在外面等
{\fs12}Wait outside.{\r}

219
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,075
謝夫特，錫恩斯和勒羅伊想跟你比試？
{\fs12}Sims and Leroy tried to muscle you, Shaft?{\r}

220
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:38,037
對
{\fs12}Yup.{\r}

221
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:41,251
勒羅伊的事 我不會計較
{\fs12}Well, I got no grudge about Leroy.{\r}

222
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,130
別叫我感激你
{\fs12}I couldn't give a damn.{\r}

223
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:44,717
我有一份工作要給你
{\fs12}I got a job for you.{\r}

224
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,641
我不想當人的嘍囉裸，顛仔
{\fs12}I'm not on the hustle, Bumpy.{\r}

225
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:49,015
是偵探的工作
{\fs12}A detective job.{\r}

226
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:53,474
-哪一種？   -你這種的，你接下吧
{\fs12}-What kind?   -Your kind. You take it.{\r}

227
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:57,561
別騙我，你在說什麼？
{\fs12}Don't jive me. What are you talking about?{\r}

228
00:21:57,657 --> 00:22:00,028
有人綁架了我的女兒，瑪希
{\fs12}Somebody kidnapped my daughter, Marcy.{\r}

229
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:02,069
做掉了幾個人
{\fs12}Done in a couple of people.{\r}

230
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:05,530
沒留下要贖金的任何條子。沒人看見什麼
{\fs12}Didn't leave no ransom note or nothing. Nobody saw nothing.{\r}

231
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,119
我希望你找到她，這是這他媽的工作
{\fs12}I want you to find her. That's the fucking job.{\r}

232
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:13,456
警察可以免費幫你做
{\fs12}The police do that for free.{\r}

233
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:16,596
不適合我。你知道我不能找警察
{\fs12}Not for me. You know I can't go to the cops.{\r}

234
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:19,132
你想要我嗎？
{\fs12}And you want me?{\r}

235
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,344
王牌偵探
{\fs12}The spade detective.{\r}

236
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:24,680
是的，我想要你，因為你是黑人王牌偵探
{\fs12}Yeah, I want you 'cause you're a black spade detective.{\r}

237
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:29,435
我想要你，因為你也涉足白人的地盤！她可能在任何地方
{\fs12}I want you 'cause you got your other foot in whitey's trough! She can be anywhere.{\r}

238
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:33,947
知道誰抓了她？
{\fs12}Got any idea who grabbed her?{\r}

239
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:38,201
許多小貓都恨我入骨
{\fs12}A lot of cats hate my guts.{\r}

240
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,494
像你這樣甜蜜，充滿愛心的傢伙？
{\fs12}A sweet, loving dude like you?{\r}

241
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,669
對人妻甜言蜜語...
{\fs12}Sweet talking a man's lady...{\r}

242
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,380
...在馬廄裡把她的男人打殘了無法上工？
{\fs12}...as you beat her man out of his paycheck in the back room of a horse parlor?{\r}

243
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,675
...又開槍打他小孩的手臂？
{\fs12}Feeding his kid shit to shoot in his arm?{\r}

244
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:56,092
誰還能恨你，顛仔？
{\fs12}Who could hate you, Bumpy?{\r}

245
00:22:56,853 --> 00:23:00,897
我的寶貝可是跟別人無冤無仇
{\fs12}My baby never sold nothing to nobody. Never took nothing from nobody.{\r}

246
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:04,819
她是個平常的孩子。她要上大學了
{\fs12}She's a straight kid. She's going to college.{\r}

247
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,194
無論是誰抓了她，就是想要脅我
{\fs12}Whoever grabbed her, got her to get at me.{\r}

248
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,905
想跟我分一杯羹，就應該衝著我來
{\fs12}They have a beef with me, they should come to me.{\r}

249
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:18,991
因此你很守規矩，而別人沒有
{\fs12}So you got a rule that somebody else don't.{\r}

250
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:26,386
你知道的就只有這些？
{\fs12}Is that all you know?{\r}

251
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:30,600
哈林有塊地盤我摸不著，有武裝分子罩著
{\fs12}There's a piece of Harlem I can't get at.
The one them militants got their arm on.{\r}

252
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,929
可能是被他們抓走的。她進了一些這樣的東西*
{\fs12}They could have my baby. She's been into some of that stuff.{\r}

253
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,519
那群人自稱是“曼巴黨”
{\fs12}Bunch calls themselves the "La Mumba's."{\r}

254
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:40,771
班.巴福德搞出來的
{\fs12}Ben Buford's thing.{\r}

255
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,946
我本可以派人去問問他們
{\fs12}I could send my people to ask them.{\r}

256
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:46,156
狗屁
{\fs12}Shit.{\r}

257
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,409
這將引起一場槍戰，結束時就會一堆死貓
{\fs12}It'd come to a shootout and when it's all over, a bunch of dead cats.{\r}

258
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,747
也許他們已殺了瑪希
{\fs12}And maybe they'd kill Marcy.{\r}

259
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,965
是啊，是你這個爸爸引起的
{\fs12}Yeah, you're Papa pimp to them.{\r}

260
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:04,762
他們想傷害你 就跟他們想傷害警察一樣
{\fs12}They want to see you burn as bad as they want to see the police burn.{\r}

261
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:07,723
但綁架女人，這就太過分了
{\fs12}But kidnapping sisters, that ain't their thing.{\r}

262
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:10,772
抓人的目的，無非就是想要錢
{\fs12}The only reason anybody grabs anybody for is money.{\r}

263
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,111
哈林還有那些幫派 這麼急著要錢 不惜抓了我的寶貝？
{\fs12}What other bunch in Harlem needs money bad enough to grab my baby?{\r}

264
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:19,145
既然你這麼以為，我有沒涉足白人地盤又有何干？
{\fs12}If you believe that, what's all this about me having a foot in whitey's trough?{\r}

265
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:22,742
我說他們抓了她，可沒說是把她藏在哈林
{\fs12}I said I think they had her. I didn't say they had her in Harlem.{\r}

266
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:25,286
他們不會傻到把她帶到郊區
{\fs12}They ain't dumb enough to take her someplace uptown.{\r}

267
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,413
還是很模糊
{\fs12}It don't lay right.{\r}

268
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:31,582
如果我知道是誰抓的，我還來找你幹嘛？
{\fs12}What the hell you think I need you for if I knew who had her?{\r}

269
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,290
我是在猜測
{\fs12}I'm guessing.{\r}

270
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:38,838
如果不是他們抓的，沒關係
{\fs12}If they don't have her, all right.{\r}

271
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,932
也許他們知道一些端倪
{\fs12}Maybe they know something.{\r}

272
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,431
我一無所知
{\fs12}I got nothing.{\r}

273
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:45,897
就是這項工作，謝夫特。
{\fs12}That's the job, Shaft.{\r}

274
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,861
你接受，還是不接受？
{\fs12}Will you take it, or no?{\r}

275
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,069
我每小時50美元
{\fs12}I get $50 an hour.{\r}

276
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,575
雜支另計
{\fs12}Plus expenses.{\r}

277
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:02,910
而且不能問我開銷的用途
{\fs12}And no questions asked about how I spend it.{\r}

278
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:05,500
就依你的
{\fs12}You got it.{\r}

279
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:08,253
我可以隨心所欲的採取任行動
{\fs12}I get a free hand to move any way I want.{\r}

280
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,425
只要你能找到我的寶貝
{\fs12}You find my baby.{\r}

281
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,063
我只要求這個
{\fs12}That's all I want.{\r}

282
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:23,480
我帶錢來了
{\fs12}I got money.{\r}

283
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:27,025
你就去花吧
{\fs12}You spend it.{\r}

284
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:30,654
而你要找到她
{\fs12}And you find her.{\r}

285
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:45,719
那夠你開始進行了
{\fs12}That'll get you started.{\r}

286
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:06,451
什麼時候能收到你的消息？
{\fs12}When will I hear from you?{\r}

287
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:12,535
只要我有東西可說
{\fs12}When I got something to say.{\r}

{\fs12}You send another cat after me with a gun,
I'll kill him and I'll come looking for you!{\r}

290
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,310
我會宰了你，顛仔
{\fs12}And I'll get you, Bumpy.{\r}

00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:26,374
我該像是台機器。這樣就沒感覺了
{\fs12}I got to feeling like a machine. That's no way to feel.{\r}

354
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:32,135
過來吧，寶貝
{\fs12}Come here, baby.{\r}

355
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,180
今天下午有一位來自郊區的訪客
{\fs12}Had a visitor from uptown this afternoon.{\r}

356
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,934
你要吃什麼？
{\fs12}What're you having?{\r}

357
00:32:51,065 --> 00:32:52,855
加芥末和洋蔥的熱狗
{\fs12}A dog with mustard and onions.{\r}

358
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:54,725
不
{\fs12}No.{\r}

359
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,194
不要洋蔥
{\fs12}Hold the onions.{\r}

360
00:32:59,868 --> 00:33:00,863
冷了，對吧？
{\fs12}Cold, huh?{\r}

361
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,742
約翰，你幹了什麼？
{\fs12}Well, John, what did you get?{\r}

362
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:16,129
我泡到妞了
{\fs12}I got laid.{\r}

363
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:40,036
郊區，兄弟。阿姆斯特丹街。慢慢來。我還早
{\fs12}Uptown, brother. Amsterdam Avenue. Take your time. I'm early.{\r}

364
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,645
冠軍，你輸了嗎？
{\fs12}Champ, you lost?{\r}

365
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,685
沒有
{\fs12}No.{\r}

366
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:37,316
你住在這裡？
{\fs12}You live around here?{\r}

367
00:34:37,402 --> 00:34:38,350
是啊
{\fs12}Yeah.{\r}

368
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:41,065
你看起來很冷。
{\fs12}You look cold.{\r}

369
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:48,491
吃點東西
{\fs12}Get something to eat.{\r}

370
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,207
哎呀，謝謝，先生
{\fs12}Gee, thanks, mister.{\r}

371
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:52,871
沒事，冠軍
{\fs12}Okay, champ.{\r}

372
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:14,429
-那是誰？    -約翰.謝夫特，班
{\fs12}-Who is it?    -John Shaft, Ben.{\r}

373
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:37,367
除非你想吸引更多人，最好把前門那一對分開
{\fs12}Unless you want more visitors, better split up that pair out front.{\r}

374
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,629
叫一個在地下室門口把風
{\fs12}Put somebody on the basement door.{\r}

375
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,005
你怎麼找到我的？
{\fs12}How did you find me?{\r}

376
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,633
不難。你有一個大嘴巴
{\fs12}Wasn't hard. You got a big mouth.{\r}

377
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:51,133
-別亂來，伙計       -你別亂來，男孩
{\fs12}-Cool it, man.   -You cool it, boy.{\r}

378
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:57,271
別讓你的嘴惹麻煩
{\fs12}Don't let your mouth get your ass in trouble.{\r}

379
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:02,484
-我跟你無話可說    -別耍我
{\fs12}-I got nothing to say to you.   -Don't jive me.{\r}

380
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:08,743
-我們在街頭一起混了很久   -陳年老事了  
{\fs12}-We've put in a lot of street time together.
-That was a long time back.{\r}

381
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,915
我不再認識你了
{\fs12}I don't know you no more.{\r}

382
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:14,329
老兄，患難之交是你忘不了的
{\fs12}A lot of hard years, man. The kind you don't forget.{\r}

383
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:22,212
我給你一分鐘說出你的來意
{\fs12}Now, I'm gonna give you one minute to say what you came here to say.{\r}

384
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:27,182
然後從你進來的那扇門出去，否則我會攆你出去
{\fs12}Then you go back out that door you came in or I'll throw you out.{\r}

385
00:37:29,525 --> 00:37:31,066
認識瑪希.喬納斯嗎？
{\fs12}You know Marcy Jonas?{\r}

386
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:33,275
-是啊，幹嘛？    -知道她在哪裡嗎？
{\fs12}-Yeah, why?   -You know where she is?{\r}

387
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,151
-你什麼意思？     -有人抓走她
{\fs12}-What do you mean?   -Somebody grabbed her.{\r}

388
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,527
顛仔認為也許是你
{\fs12}Bumpy thinks maybe it was you.{\r}

389
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,622
我們不做那種事
{\fs12}We don't do that kind of thing.{\r}

390
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:46,666
此事你有所了解嗎？
{\fs12}You know anything about it?{\r}

391
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:50,622
湯姆，你的一分鐘到了。出去！
{\fs12}Tom, you used up your minute. Get out!{\r}

392
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:51,665
不要“湯姆”我，老兄！
{\fs12}Don't "Tom" me, man!{\r}

393
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,795
-槍在哪裡？       -這裡沒有
{\fs12}-Where are the guns?    -None here.{\r}

394
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:57,425
真該死的！
{\fs12}I'll be goddamned!{\r}

395
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:01,804
桑尼！桑尼！
{\fs12}Sonny! Sonny!{\r}

396
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:03,183
他們來了！
{\fs12}They're coming!{\r}

397
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:04,981
-在屋頂上？    -是啊。走！
{\fs12}-Up on the roof?    -Yeah. Go!{\r}

398
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:09,441
他死了
{\fs12}He's dead.{\r}

399
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:10,941
快，快！
{\fs12}Come on, come on!{\r}

400
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,950
別上屋頂，走這邊！
{\fs12}Not the roof, this way!{\r}

401
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:23,875
退後
{\fs12}Stand back.{\r}

402
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:27,511
-這是什麼？    -一切都會好起來的
{\fs12}-What is this?   -Everything will be fine.{\r}

403
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:30,554
-這是什麼？       -去那邊保持安靜
{\fs12}-What is this?   -Go over there and be quiet.{\r}

404
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:24,195
一切都沒事，女士。不用擔心
{\fs12}Everything's okay, ma'am. No need to worry.{\r}

405
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:27,534
抱歉你的門
{\fs12}Sorry about your door.{\r}

406
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,701
這該夠了吧
{\fs12}That'll take care of it.{\r}

407
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:33,206
你出賣了我們，老兄！
{\fs12}You set us up, man!{\r}

408
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,092
拜託，年輕人
{\fs12}Young man, please.{\r}

409
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:39,542
別那樣做
{\fs12}Don't do that.{\r}

410
00:39:39,807 --> 00:39:44,718
不要再威脅我！別叫我叛徒！
{\fs12}Don't ever threaten me again! And don't call me Judas!{\r}

411
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:29,690
來吧，現在沒時間計算死人。快！
{\fs12}Come on. It's no time to count your dead. Come on!{\r}

412
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:46,750
看
{\fs12}Look.{\r}

413
00:40:54,062 --> 00:40:55,175
來吧！
{\fs12}Come on!{\r}

414
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:02,570
就邊，這邊！
{\fs12}This way, this way!{\r}

415
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:08,071
你的人？
{\fs12}One of yours?{\r}

416
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,244
-不是     -可能是一個眼線
{\fs12}-No.    -Probably a finger man.{\r}

417
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,225
你領導那場革命時，白人最好站著不動...
{\fs12}When you lead that revolution, whitey better be standing still...{\r}

418
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:34,022
...因為你再跑也沒用了！
{\fs12}...'cause you don't run worth a damn no more!{\r}

419
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:35,526
我們別再跑了，老兄
{\fs12}We're done running, man.{\r}

420
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,983
那我們是在幹嘛，老兄？
{\fs12}What the hell do you call this, man?{\r}

421
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,426
我得搞清楚，他們在追你 還是追我
{\fs12}I got to find out if they're after you or me.{\r}

422
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:15,407
我把你交給一些朋友。他們是普通人
{\fs12}I'll leave you with some friends. They're straight people.{\r}

423
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:18,779
因此，你不要跟他們隨便開玩笑
{\fs12}So don't you lay any of that Uncle Tom jive on them.{\r}

424
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:28,540
這關係很複雜，我拼湊不起來
{\fs12}I don't know what's connected to what. I can't piece them together.{\r}

425
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,957
接電話
{\fs12}Answer that.{\r}

426
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:33,544
發生後才過半個小時
{\fs12}It's only a half an hour since it happened.{\r}

427
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,632
我哪能這麼快就有線索？
{\fs12}How could I have something this soon?{\r}

428
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:37,219
他在另一條線上
{\fs12}He's on the other line.{\r}

429
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:39,138
我才不會費心去擔心...
{\fs12}I'm not paid enough to worry...{\r}

430
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,899
...專員或市長在想什麼！
{\fs12}...about what the Commissioner or the Mayor thinks!{\r}

431
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:44,392
那是謝夫特，你想跟他說話嗎？
{\fs12}It's Shaft. You want to talk to him?{\r}

432
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:47,108
我有一通電話，可能是些消息。稍等
{\fs12}I got a call. I might have something. Hold on.{\r}

433
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:49,363
不，還是我打給你好了
{\fs12}No, better I call you back.{\r}

434
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:54,162
我想見你
{\fs12}I'm coming to see you.{\r}

435
00:42:54,874 --> 00:42:56,866
你一直都沒幫我
{\fs12}You've been holding out on me.{\r}

436
00:42:57,252 --> 00:43:00,502
我會等。聽著，幾隻貓在哈林被殺了
{\fs12}I'll wait. Listen, several cats were killed in Harlem.{\r}

437
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,416
你知道這件事嗎？
{\fs12}You know anything about it?{\r}

438
00:43:02,508 --> 00:43:04,298
我就在那裡，隊長
{\fs12}I was there, Lieutenant.{\r}

439
00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:18,482
督察在家，回電給他。說我去追查一條線索
{\fs12}The Captain's at home. Call him back.
Tell him I left to chase down a lead.{\r}

440
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:21,938
-你要去哪裡？  -不一定，只要別讓他煩我
{\fs12}-Where are you going?   -Nowhere. Just get him off my back.{\r}

441
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,653
有個報社記者想來採訪
{\fs12}A reporter from the News wants an interview.{\r}

442
00:43:25,661 --> 00:43:29,112
要他打電話給督察，讓那老混蛋忙一下
{\fs12}Tell him to call the Captain. Serves the old bastard right.{\r}

443
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:33,037
這是情報部門給的清單
{\fs12}This is that list from the intelligence section.{\r}

444
00:43:33,128 --> 00:43:34,705
這些照片怎麼樣？
{\fs12}What about the pictures?{\r}

445
00:43:34,797 --> 00:43:38,082
他們正忙著湊起來，說要五分鐘
{\fs12}They're getting them together now. Said about five minutes.{\r}

446
00:43:38,176 --> 00:43:40,749
謝夫特下來了，叫他馬上進來
{\fs12}Shaft's coming down. Send him right in.{\r}

447
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:58,899
迪娜會把你的床鋪好。老兄你怎麼不睡一覺？
{\fs12}Dina'll get you a bed made up. Why don't you get some sleep, man?{\r}

448
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:03,319
放著一些死去的兄弟在那裡躺著
{\fs12}Got some dead brothers laying out there.{\r}

449
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:06,073
這不是我該來的地方
{\fs12}And this ain't where I should be.{\r}

450
00:44:06,502 --> 00:44:10,001
在發現他們的死因前，這是你唯一能待的地方！
{\fs12}Till we find out why they're dead, this is the only place for you to be!{\r}

451
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,917
你的想法像個白人！
{\fs12}You think like a white man!{\r}

452
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:13,585
你不用腦筋！你想找死嗎？
{\fs12}You don't think! You want to get wasted?{\r}

453
00:44:13,677 --> 00:44:15,218
如果會死就算了！
{\fs12}If that's what it takes!{\r}

454
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:17,260
馬文正在睡覺。
{\fs12}Marvin's sleeping.{\r}

455
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:26,183
我會想出該怎麼做，然後明早再來接你
{\fs12}I'll find out what I can and pick you up in the morning.{\r}

456
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:29,600
你認為這樣我就欠你人情，你就錯了
{\fs12}If you think I'll owe you for this, you're wrong.{\r}

457
00:44:29,738 --> 00:44:31,315
我又沒圖你什麼！
{\fs12}You got nothing I want!{\r}

458
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:35,152
那女孩的房間給你用
{\fs12}You can have the girls' room.{\r}

459
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,747
我得出去。有備份鑰匙嗎，我回來就不用叫醒你？
{\fs12}I got to go out. Got an extra key so I don't wake you when I come back?{\r}

460
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,296
這也可以打開樓下的門
{\fs12}This'll open the downstairs door, too.{\r}

461
00:44:55,978 --> 00:44:57,388
注意你的言行
{\fs12}Watch your mouth.{\r}

462
00:44:57,522 --> 00:44:58,932
我想說什麼 就說什麼
{\fs12}I'll say anything I want.{\r}

463
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:02,436
這房子裡不行。在這裡你不會
{\fs12}Not in this house. Not here, you won't.{\r}

464
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,010
拿椅子坐
{\fs12}Have a chair.{\r}

465
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,136
我不喜歡你的椅子
{\fs12}I don't like your chair.{\r}

466
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,686
你什麼都沒幫我，維克。
{\fs12}You gave me nothing, Vic.{\r}

467
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:39,152
有人摔出我的窗戶，你就想用誤殺關我...
{\fs12}You want to lock me up for manslaughter 'cause someone went out of my window...{\r}

468
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,400
...那就關吧
{\fs12}...go ahead.{\r}

469
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:43,366
你沒資格談交易
{\fs12}You got no deal.{\r}

470
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,620
那我也沒東西可以給你，那是事實
{\fs12}I have nothing else to give you, then. That's straight.{\r}

471
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,832
你現在有什麼？
{\fs12}What do you got now?{\r}

472
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:52,460
首先是一個問題。
{\fs12}One question first.{\r}

473
00:45:52,546 --> 00:45:56,164
能指認那些帶機槍的傢伙 都被滅口了！
{\fs12}Anyone who could've identified those guys with machine guns got wiped out!{\r}

474
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:57,171
是嗎？
{\fs12}Yeah?{\r}

475
00:45:57,259 --> 00:46:01,043
班.巴福德的五個人，也許是那個指責你的人。
{\fs12}Five of Ben Buford's people and probably the guy that fingered you.{\r}

476
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,636
我？你確定是我嗎？
{\fs12}Me? Are you sure it's me?{\r}

477
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:08,979
我敢肯定，如果我知道這些人是黑人還是白人。
{\fs12}I'd be sure if I knew if the guys were black or white.{\r}

478
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:11,230
我告訴你他們80-20。
{\fs12}I'd make it 80-20 they were after you.{\r}

479
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:13,773
但是顛仔可能肯定會告訴你。
{\fs12}But Bumpy could probably tell you that for sure.{\r}

480
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:15,487
只要說出你得到了什麼，伙計。
{\fs12}Just say what you got, man.{\r}

481
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:19,151
一些可能適合的事情。
{\fs12}A few things that may fit.{\r}

482
00:46:21,371 --> 00:46:25,036
你還記得我曾告訴過你，顛仔在哈林將他的船員加倍嗎？
{\fs12}Do you remember I told you that Bumpy was doubling his crews up in Harlem?{\r}

483
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:25,955
所以？
{\fs12}So?{\r}

484
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,083
所以，市中心我們有一些遊客。
{\fs12}So, downtown we get some visitors.{\r}

485
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:32,842
來自洛杉磯的三個人，兩個來自鳳凰城，一個來自Decatur的人，lllinois ...
{\fs12}Three guys from LA, two from Phoenix, a guy from Decatur, lllinois...{\r}

486
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:37,212
...來自費城的四個人總共大約15個我們確定的。
{\fs12}...four guys from Philly. Altogether about 15 that we're sure of.{\r}

487
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:39,220
特別的人，對吧？
{\fs12}Special guys, huh?{\r}

488
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,598
所有人都懷疑是黑手黨的槍支。
{\fs12}All suspected being guns for the Mafia.{\r}

489
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:43,349
剛進城。
{\fs12}Just got into town.{\r}

490
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:47,142
他們大多數住在村里的一家酒店。參觀景點。
{\fs12}Most of them staying at a hotel in the Village. Taking in the sights.{\r}

491
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:50,901
是嗎？
{\fs12}Is that it?{\r}

492
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:52,781
不，還有一件事。
{\fs12}No, one thing more.{\r}

493
00:46:53,661 --> 00:46:56,994
來自哈林的幾個帥哥去了澤西島。
{\fs12}A couple of dudes from Harlem go across to Jersey.{\r}

494
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,534
試圖綁架一些黑手黨大佬。他們吹了它。
{\fs12}Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig. They blew it.{\r}

495
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:02,542
他們殺了這個傢伙的跑步者。
{\fs12}They killed the guy's runner.{\r}

496
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,749
但這名男子說，他的跑步者在佛羅里達釣魚。
{\fs12}But the man says his runner was in Florida on a fishing trip.{\r}

497
00:47:08,803 --> 00:47:11,340
-看起來像戰爭來了。-這是一件壞事。
{\fs12}-Looks like war coming.   -It's a bad thing.{\r}

498
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:15,302
黑手黨對抗顛仔。它的引擎蓋罩在內側。
{\fs12}Mafia against Bumpy. It's hood against hood, on the inside.{\r}

499
00:47:15,437 --> 00:47:17,643
在外面，它是白色的黑色。
{\fs12}On the outside, it's black against white.{\r}

500
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,599
如果這件事打破了，我們可以在百老匯有坦克和部隊。
{\fs12}We could have tanks and troops on Broadway if this thing breaks open.{\r}

501
00:47:25,115 --> 00:47:26,988
是的，你有一個觀點。
{\fs12}Yeah, you got a point.{\r}

502
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:30,371
這是我們的一些訪客的樣子。
{\fs12}This is what some of our visitors look like.{\r}

503
00:47:31,914 --> 00:47:33,573
這是一個美好的時光。
{\fs12}Be a good time for it.{\r}

504
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:34,864
什麼？戰爭？
{\fs12}What? War?{\r}

505
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,326
在佛羅里達釣魚。
{\fs12}Fishing down in Florida.{\r}

506
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:40,506
如果我知道顛仔聘請你的話，這可能會有所幫助。
{\fs12}It might help if I knew what Bumpy hired you for.{\r}

507
00:47:40,717 --> 00:47:42,543
-他說他做了。-他做到了。
{\fs12}-Never said he did.   -He did.{\r}

508
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:46,544
說是或否，這違背了我的道德觀。
{\fs12}It's against my ethics to say yes or no.{\r}

509
00:47:47,308 --> 00:47:49,715
-他讓你當場，謝夫特。-他做了什麼？
{\fs12}-He put you on the spot, Shaft.   -He did?{\r}

510
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:53,305
維克，你是一個非常聰明的高加索人。
{\fs12}You're a very wise Caucasian, Vic.{\r}

511
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:58,557
我會在這的。如果我不是，請在家給我打電話。
{\fs12}I'll be here. If I'm not, call me at home.{\r}

512
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:01,281
那是一種安慰。
{\fs12}That's a comfort.{\r}

513
00:48:11,629 --> 00:48:13,371
-你好？ -你好寶貝。
{\fs12}-Hello?      -Hello, baby.{\r}

514
00:48:14,216 --> 00:48:15,460
我等了
{\fs12}I waited up.{\r}

515
00:48:16,177 --> 00:48:18,465
-抱歉，我做不到。-有問題嗎？
{\fs12}-Sorry, I can't make it.   -Got problems?{\r}

516
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:21,680
是的，我有幾個。
{\fs12}Yeah, I got a couple of them.{\r}

517
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:26,217
我天生黑了，我天生貧窮。
{\fs12}I was born black and I was born poor.{\r}

518
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,348
我愛你。
{\fs12}I love you.{\r}

519
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:32,397
是的，我知道。
{\fs12}Yeah, I know.{\r}

520
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:34,691
別緊張。
{\fs12}Take it easy.{\r}

521
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,370
嘿...
{\fs12}Hey...{\r}

522
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:50,461
起床。
{\fs12}Get up.{\r}

523
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,844
我們有一個人要看。
{\fs12}We've got a man to see.{\r}

524
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:55,376
是啊。
{\fs12}Yeah.{\r}

525
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,490
看看你是誰，好嗎？
{\fs12}See who that is, will you?{\r}

526
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:25,710
這是謝夫特
{\fs12}It's Shaft.{\r}

527
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,257
讓他進來
{\fs12}Let him in.{\r}

528
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,314
-我和顛仔約好了。-我知道這一切。
{\fs12}-I have an appointment with Bumpy.   -I know all about it.{\r}

529
00:49:46,702 --> 00:49:49,655
在你看到這個男人之前我必須先看看你是否乾淨。
{\fs12}I've got to see if you're clean before you can see the man.{\r}

530
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:53,286
那麼最好再給自己六個助手。
{\fs12}Better get yourself six more helpers then.{\r}

531
00:49:55,629 --> 00:49:57,087
這就是它的完成方式。
{\fs12}That's how it's done.{\r}

532
00:49:57,506 --> 00:49:58,833
誰搜索你？
{\fs12}Who searches you?{\r}

533
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:00,170
沒有人。
{\fs12}Nobody.{\r}

534
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,424
然後得到同一隻貓來搜索我們。
{\fs12}Then get the same cat to search us.{\r}

535
00:50:07,226 --> 00:50:10,226
在你進去之前我必須看看你是否有槍。
{\fs12}I've got to see if you got a gun on you before you go in.{\r}

536
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:14,521
告訴顛仔我們在這裡。來吧，班
{\fs12}Tell Bumpy we were here. Come on, Ben.{\r}

537
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,567
威利，你現在會讓他們走路嗎？
{\fs12}You gonna let them walk now, Willy?{\r}

538
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:18,771
顛仔會有你的尾巴。
{\fs12}Bumpy'll have your tail.{\r}

539
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,659
在這兒等一下，我會打電話給那個男人。
{\fs12}Wait here, I'll call in to the man.{\r}

540
00:50:30,504 --> 00:50:32,246
你想要什麼，威利？
{\fs12}What do you want, Willy?{\r}

541
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:35,799
-謝夫特和一些傢伙在這裡。-發送給他們。
{\fs12}-Shaft's out here with some dude.   -Send them in.{\r}

542
00:50:36,178 --> 00:50:38,633
他不會讓我看看他們是否乾淨。
{\fs12}He won't let me see if they are clean.{\r}

543
00:50:39,056 --> 00:50:40,383
讓他們進來吧。
{\fs12}Let them in.{\r}

544
00:50:42,393 --> 00:50:43,886
繼續，你聽到了他的聲音。
{\fs12}Go on, you heard him.{\r}

545
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:48,768
聽著，白雪公主...
{\fs12}Listen, Snow White...{\r}

546
00:50:50,237 --> 00:50:52,359
...我們遲早會糾結。
{\fs12}...we're gonna tangle sooner or later.{\r}

547
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:56,193
你聽到我說的了嗎？
{\fs12}Did you hear what I said?{\r}

548
00:50:56,369 --> 00:50:58,776
你為什麼不停止玩自己？
{\fs12}Why don't you stop playing with yourself?{\r}

549
00:50:59,831 --> 00:51:01,538
你不會做狗屎！
{\fs12}You ain't gonna do shit!{\r}

550
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:33,485
你是一個謹慎的幽靈，顛仔
{\fs12}You're a cagey spook, Bumpy.{\r}

551
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:36,112
謝夫特先生，你騎著一匹高大的馬。
{\fs12}You ride a tall horse, Mr. Shaft.{\r}

552
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:41,669
這是班.巴福德。昨晚你的小朋友花了他五個朋友。
{\fs12}This is Ben Buford. Your little caper cost him five friends last night.{\r}

553
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:46,250
-我們會把它從你的屁股裡拿出來，皮條客。-你推我一點點。
{\fs12}-We'll take it out of your ass, pimp.   -You're pushing me a little far.{\r}

554
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,297
我發現了一些東西，顛仔。
{\fs12}I found out some things, Bumpy.{\r}

555
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:54,388
你知道是誰抓住你的女兒，而不是班或他的人...
{\fs12}You knew who grabbed your daughter, and that it wasn't Ben or his people...{\r}

556
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:57,018
...當你把我所有的東西放在我辦公室的時候。
{\fs12}...when you laid all that jive on me in my office.{\r}

557
00:51:57,108 --> 00:52:00,607
我告訴過你，沒有任何說明。我還是不知道誰有她。
{\fs12}I told you, there was no note. I still don't know who has her.{\r}

558
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:02,231
你撒謊，伙計！
{\fs12}You're lying, man!{\r}

559
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:05,359
現在，直接處理它們，或者根本不處理它們！
{\fs12}Now, deal them up straight, or don't deal them at all!{\r}

560
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:08,066
你從黑手黨那裡抓起了麻煩。
{\fs12}You grabbed the dope hustle up here from the Mafia.{\r}

561
00:52:08,497 --> 00:52:10,323
給自己做了一些大麵包。
{\fs12}Made yourself some big bread.{\r}

562
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,664
現在，黑手黨想要進入你。
{\fs12}Now the Mafia wants to move in on you.{\r}

563
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,382
所以呢？
{\fs12}So what?{\r}

564
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,386
所以，黑手黨抓住了你的女兒。
{\fs12}So, the Mafia grabbed your daughter.{\r}

565
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:24,921
你知道的。
{\fs12}You knew it.{\r}

566
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,134
當你僱用我時，你就知道了。
{\fs12}You knew it when you hired me.{\r}

567
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:31,477
是啊。
{\fs12}Yeah.{\r}

568
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:34,600
你試圖抓住一個進行交易。

{\fs12}You tried to snatch one for a trade.{\r}

569
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:37,402
但你那些狡猾的朋友在那裡吹了它。
{\fs12}But your flunky friends out there blew it.{\r}

570
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:42,153
他們燒了一些孩子。錯過了我們想要抓住交易的人。
{\fs12}They burned some kid. Missed the man we wanted to grab for a trade.{\r}

571
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,079
然後你想要喧囂老謝夫特
{\fs12}Then you wanted to hustle old Shaft.{\r}

572
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:49,542
我雇了你一份工作。我騙了你，但我從來沒騙過你。
{\fs12}I hired you for a job. I conned you, but I never lied to you.{\r}

573
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:51,629
我的寶寶被抓了。
{\fs12}My baby was grabbed.{\r}

574
00:52:52,216 --> 00:52:55,667
你會讓她回來的。你買了這筆交易。你會活著的。
{\fs12}You'll get her back. You bought that deal. You're gonna live with it.{\r}

575
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,180
寶貝，不是這些價格。
{\fs12}Not at these prices, baby.{\r}

576
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:10,069
我告訴你它的成本，成本。
{\fs12}I told you what it costs, it costs.{\r}

577
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:17,442
很多大肆宣傳的黑人給你帶來的錢，皮條客！
{\fs12}A lot of hyped-up black people give you that money you're spending, pimp!{\r}

578
00:53:22,544 --> 00:53:26,126
男孩，你不要試圖胡扯我嗎？我們都在喧囂中。
{\fs12}Don't you try to bullshit me, boy. We're all on the hustle.{\r}

579
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,506
我賣廣告，塗料和數字。
{\fs12}I sell broads and dope and numbers.{\r}

580
00:53:29,803 --> 00:53:32,554
你賣垃圾和藍天。這是完全相同的遊戲。
{\fs12}You sell crap and blue sky. It's all the same game.{\r}

581
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:39,262
你知道黑手黨的貓會跟著我來，不是嗎？
{\fs12}You knew the Mafia cats would come after me, didn't you?{\r}

582
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:41,724
但它並沒有動搖我。
{\fs12}But it doesn't shake me up.{\r}

583
00:53:42,193 --> 00:53:44,683
他們採取了一個很好的行動來取消我的前線人物。
{\fs12}They made a good move to take out my front man.{\r}

584
00:53:44,863 --> 00:53:47,151
他們可能會再試一次。我會。
{\fs12}They'll probably try again. I would.{\r}

585
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:50,981
你一直在用我，顛仔。格蘭格我
{\fs12}You been using me, Bumpy. Suckered me.{\r}

586
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:55,791
沒關係。我們面對面站著。
{\fs12}That's okay. We stood face to face.{\r}

587
00:53:57,336 --> 00:54:00,455
但是，我想知道你為什麼要我和班聯繫。
{\fs12}But, I want to know why you wanted me to hook up with Ben.{\r}

588
00:54:06,222 --> 00:54:09,222
因為你需要一支軍隊讓我的寶寶回來。
{\fs12}'Cause you're gonna need an army to get my baby back.{\r}

589
00:54:10,226 --> 00:54:11,221
班有一個。
{\fs12}Ben's got one.{\r}

590
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,270
我的人民在哈林區之外不值得去。
{\fs12}My people ain't worth a damn outside of Harlem.{\r}

591
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:16,977
如果你認為我冒一些兄弟的風險...
{\fs12}If you think I'd risk some of the brothers...{\r}

592
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:20,436
...只是因為你的女兒是黑人，你錯了，伙計。
{\fs12}...just 'cause your daughter's black, you're wrong, man.{\r}

593
00:54:22,532 --> 00:54:23,729
我們需要錢。
{\fs12}We need money.{\r}

594

我有很多兄弟姐妹在監獄裡。

設定價格。
{\fs12}Set a price.{\r}

596
00:54:34,588 --> 00:54:35,915
一萬美元頭。
{\fs12}$10,000 a head.{\r}

597
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:42,093
這就是這位謙遜的政府為了保險而在陸軍中支付一隻貓的原因。
{\fs12}That's what the honky government pays a cat in the Army for insurance.{\r}

598
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:44,515
每人10,000美元。

行。
{\fs12}All right.{\r}

601
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,651
你告訴我你願意為瑪希佈置那種麵包嗎？
{\fs12}You telling me you're willing to lay out that kind of bread for Marcy?{\r}

602
00:55:03,373 --> 00:55:04,783
伙計，別跟我說吧。
{\fs12}Don't jive me, man.{\r}

603
00:55:05,793 --> 00:55:07,500
我總能得到更多的錢。
{\fs12}I can always get more money.{\r}

604
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,409
我只有一個孩子。
{\fs12}I only got one baby.{\r}

605
00:55:11,216 --> 00:55:15,130
-這意味著你已經為他昨晚失去的男人欠他5萬美元。
{\fs12}-That means you already owe him $50,000 for the men he lost last night.{\r}

606
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:17,461
行。
{\fs12}All right.{\r}

{\fs12}We can get a lot of brothers and sisters out of jail with that.{\r}

608
00:55:23,063 --> 00:55:24,640
他需要多少人？
{\fs12}How many of his you'll need?{\r}

609
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:28,140
取決於黑手黨是否會收取贖金。
{\fs12}Depends on whether the Mafia will take a ransom.{\r}

610
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:32,444
-他們想要哈林，沒什麼。-不是你的。不再。
{\fs12}-They want Harlem, nothing less.   -It ain't yours to give. Not anymore.{\r}

611
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:34,567
我是不是，不是他們的。
{\fs12}Mine or not, it's not gonna be theirs.{\r}

612
00:55:34,661 --> 00:55:38,493
我所要做的就是找出他們把她帶到家的地方。
{\fs12}All I gotta do is find out where they've got her and bring her home.{\r}

613
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:39,822
而已。
{\fs12}That's it.{\r}

614
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:42,866
如果他的價值1萬美元，我的價值2萬美元。
{\fs12}If he's worth $10,000, I'm worth $20,000.{\r}

615
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:46,332
你得到了，COD。
{\fs12}You got it, COD.{\r}

616
00:55:46,925 --> 00:55:48,881
現在一半，我把她帶回家的一半。
{\fs12}Half now, half when I bring her home.{\r}

617
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:49,799
所有！
{\fs12}All!{\r}

618
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:51,717
馬上！
{\fs12}Right now!{\r}

619
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,552
一半，這是我做的最好的。
{\fs12}Half, that's the best I'll do.{\r}

620
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,927
你只是被吵了，顛仔

今晚交錢。
{\fs12}Deliver the money tonight.{\r}

我會讓我的男孩們放棄它。
{\fs12}I'll have my boys drop it off.{\r}

623
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:08,408
按照這些價格，你吹它，謝夫特，我不會喜歡它。
{\fs12}At these prices, you blow it, Shaft, I'm not gonna like it.{\r}

624
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:10,277
一點兒都沒有。
{\fs12}Not even a little bit.{\r}

625
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:14,581
我以為錢對你來說無關緊要。剛剛讓寶寶回來
{\fs12}I thought the money didn't matter to you. Just getting your baby back.{\r}

626
00:56:17,629 --> 00:56:19,419
金錢總是很重要。
{\fs12}Money always matters.{\r}

627

這是我下車的地方，伙計。
{\fs12}This is where I get off, man.{\r}

628
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:39,898
有一點我們必須直截了當。如果談到戰鬥，我們會??按照自己的方式行事。
{\fs12}One thing we got to get straight. If it comes to a fight, we do it my way.{\r}

629
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:43,279
對於那種麵包，兄弟們會玩。
{\fs12}For that kind of bread, the brothers'll play.{\r}

630
00:56:43,368 --> 00:56:45,526
只要你記得我們欠他們五個。
{\fs12}As long as you remember we owe them five.{\r}

631
00:56:45,621 --> 00:56:46,782
我說，我的方式！
{\fs12}I said, my way!{\r}

{\fs12}How about letting me take over the bar for a while?{\r}

644
00:58:49,145 --> 00:58:51,718
20美元我不會做任何事情。
{\fs12}There's nothing I wouldn't do for $20.{\r}

645

01:04:17,205 --> 01:04:20,039
有兩個。我們在這裡很慷慨。
{\fs12}There's two of them. We're generous around here.{\r}

702
01:04:31,055 --> 01:04:32,429
也不是那麼壞。
{\fs12}It's not so bad.{\r}

703
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:39,554
這是你到這裡的一個不錯的墊子。
{\fs12}It's a nice pad you got here.{\r}

704
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:43,441
我要上樓洗澡。我馬上就回來。
{\fs12}I'm going upstairs to take a shower. I'll be right back.{\r}

705
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:53,912
我等不及了。
{\fs12}I just couldn't wait.{\r}

706
01:05:21,406 --> 01:05:23,694
-你說什麼，維克？ -'早上。
{\fs12}-What do you say, Vic?   -'Morning.{\r}

707
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:27,869
他們倆都有槍支，攜帶它們的許可證。
{\fs12}Both of them had guns, licenses to carry them.{\r}

708
01:05:28,582 --> 01:05:31,155
許可證稱，“珠寶快遞員”。
{\fs12}"Jewelry couriers," the licenses say.{\r}

709
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,287
底特律人。
{\fs12}Detroit people.{\r}

710
01:05:35,257 --> 01:05:37,926
-你會把它們鬆開嗎？ -我沒有選擇。
{\fs12}-Will you turn them loose?   -I have no choice.{\r}

711
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:40,753
他們會離開小鎮。
{\fs12}They'll leave town.{\r}

712
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:43,681
你會有陌生人找你，而不是他們。
{\fs12}You'll have strangers looking for you, not them.{\r}

713
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:46,516
我可以和他們私聊嗎？
{\fs12}Can I have a private talk with them?{\r}

714
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:50,647
你現在要對可憐的卡門做些什麼？給他癌症？
{\fs12}What you'll do to poor Carmen now? Give him cancer?{\r}

715
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:53,900
你低下頭，安頓下來。
{\fs12}You busted his head, settle.{\r}

716
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:58,443
我想了解他對城市更新的看法。
{\fs12}I want to find out his views on urban renewal.{\r}

717
01:06:02,331 --> 01:06:03,444
行。
{\fs12}All right.{\r}

718
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:10,916
湯姆·...
{\fs12}Tom...{\r}

719
01:06:29,405 --> 01:06:31,397
我是在為顛仔.喬納斯說話。
{\fs12}I'm speaking for Bumpy Jonas.{\r}

720
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:34,028
他想確定他的女兒沒關係。
{\fs12}He wants to be sure his daughter's okay.{\r}

721
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:39,115
我的話就是他所要的。沒有電話，也沒有她的來信。
{\fs12}My word is all he'll take. No phone calls and no letters from her.{\r}

722
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,578
我得看她。
{\fs12}I've got to see her.{\r}

723
01:06:43,463 --> 01:06:45,087
那麼也許他會處理。
{\fs12}Then maybe he'll deal.{\r}

724
01:06:46,843 --> 01:06:49,250
我想在這個老鼠洞裡說什麼。
{\fs12}Nothing I want to say in this rat hole.{\r}

725
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:53,386
-人們可能在聽。-這是我們必須承擔的風險。
{\fs12}-People might be listening.   -That's a risk we'll have to take.{\r}

726
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,015
現在給我一個號碼，這樣我就可以告訴你我將在哪裡。
{\fs12}Now give me a number so I can let you know where I'll be.{\r}

727
01:06:58,023 --> 01:07:00,560

{\fs12}-Come here.    -Party's over.{\r}

你必須拆分。

其他時間。同樣的感覺，同一個地方。
{\fs12}Some other time. Same feeling, same place.{\r}

把班放在上面。

{\fs12}You're really great in the sack, but...{\r}

739
01:08:46,486 --> 01:08:48,644
...之後你很邋..
{\fs12}...you're pretty shitty afterwards.{\r}

740
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:52,480
是嗎？

756
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:24,434
我沒時間聊聊天。
{\fs12}I got no time for chats.{\r}

{\fs12}Me? I could turn the other way.{\r}

聽不到我聽到的。
{\fs12}Not hear what I heard.{\r}

762
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:05,560
這是我聽到的那個大耳朵的督察
{\fs12}It's that big-eared Captain I got who was listening.{\r}

但他想問你。

769
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:28,969
現在。在車站。
{\fs12}Now. At the station.{\r}

770
01:11:31,101 --> 01:11:32,678
糟糕的時機，對吧？
{\fs12}Lousy timing, right?{\r}

771
01:11:33,103 --> 01:11:34,513
要帶我進去？
{\fs12}Gonna take me in?{\r}

772

如果我找到你，我會的。

01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:45,776
這太糟糕了。
{\fs12}That's too bad.{\r}

776
01:11:52,752 --> 01:11:54,245
回家後給我打電話。
{\fs12}Call me when you get home.{\r}

{\fs12}"Close it yourself, Shitty."{\r}

779
01:12:29,754 --> 01:12:32,540
這是謝夫特。現在直截了當！
{\fs12}This is Shaft. Now get this straight!{\r}

濃咖啡。

785
01:13:44,635 --> 01:13:47,386
你不想要三明治或其他東西嗎？
{\fs12}Don't you want a sandwich or something with it?{\r}

786
01:13:48,348 --> 01:13:49,758
只是濃咖啡。

我希望你不喜歡檸檬皮。

放手吧。

{\fs12}I'm looking for a nigger named John Shaft.{\r}

792
01:14:58,516 --> 01:15:00,389
你才找到他，哇！

坐下。

{\fs12}Why don't you have some?{\r}

如果你很好
{\fs12}Maybe they'll put a little garlic in it,

在你之後，伙計。

你住在這裡
{\fs12}You stay here.{\r}

808
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:04,887
你繞過後面，留意胡同門。遠離視線。

809
01:19:05,229 --> 01:19:06,971
如果他們出來我們怎麼辦？
{\fs12}What if they come out our way?{\r}

810
01:19:07,064 --> 01:19:10,729
你跟著他們。嗯，你回來找我。現在移動吧！
{\fs12}You follow them. Remmy, you come back for me. Now move it!{\r}

811
01:19:24,376 --> 01:19:27,210
無噪音。現在，直接回答我。
{\fs12}No noise. Now, answer me straight.{\r}

好的。
{\fs12}Okay.{\r}

816
01:19:37,684 --> 01:19:42,097
當我告訴你的時候，你打開那扇門就像這把槍一樣要把頭吹開。
{\fs12}When I tell you, you open that door like this gun was about to blow your head off.{\r}

817
01:19:43,442 --> 01:19:45,517
沒有信號或你走了。得到它了？

{\fs12}There's nothing you can do, Shaft.{\r}

{\fs12}Except go back to Harlem and tell Bumpy his little girl is fine.{\r}

{\fs12}She's our ace. You never give up your ace.{\r}

01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:25,441
可能你是對的。
{\fs12}Maybe you're right.{\r}

{\fs12}Change your mind, you can walk right now.{\r}

那就對了。
{\fs12}That's right.{\r}

讓我離開這裡。
{\fs12}Get me up out of here.{\r}
