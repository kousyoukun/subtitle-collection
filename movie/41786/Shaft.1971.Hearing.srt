TOM: This is that list
from the intelligence section.

477
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,953
VlC: What about the pictures?

478
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,191
TOM: They're getting them together now.
Said about five minutes.

479
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,748
Shaft's coming down. Send him right in.

480
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,151
Dina'll get you a bed made up.
Why don't you get some sleep, man?

481
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,390
Got some dead brothers laying out there.

482
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,031
And this ain't where I should be.

483
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,796
Till we find out why they're dead,
this is the only place for you to be!

484
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,633
You think like a white man!

485
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,233
You don't think! You want to get wasted?

486
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,799
If that's what it takes!

487
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,757
DlNA: Marvin's sleeping.

488
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,313
I'll find out what I can and pick you up
in the morning.

489
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,590
If you think I'll owe you for this,
you're wrong.

490
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,233
You got nothing I want!

491
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,912
DlNA: You can have the girls' room.

492
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,154
I got to go out. Got an extra key
so I don't wake you when I come back?

493
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,269
This'll open the downstairs door, too.

494
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,233
Watch your mouth.

495
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,713
I'll say anything I want.

496
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,074
Not in this house. Not here, you won't.

497
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,479
[Shaft chuckles]

498
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,595
Have a chair.

499
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,633
I don't like your chair.

500
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,996
You gave me nothing, Vic.

501
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,279
You want to lock me up for manslaughter
'cause someone went out of my window...

502
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,435
...go ahead.

503
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,319
SHAFT: You got no deal.

504
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,357
VlC: I have nothing else to give you, then.
That's straight.

505
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,479
What do you got now?

506
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,039
One question first.

507
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,590
Anyone who could've identified those guys
with machine guns got wiped out!

508
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,556
Yeah?

509
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,269
Five of Ben Buford's people
and probably the guy that fingered you.

510
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,714
Me? Are you sure it's me?

511
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,878
I'd be sure if I knew if the guys
were black or white.

512
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,037
I'd make it 80-20 they were after you.

513
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,475
But Bumpy could probably tell you that
for sure.

514
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,118
Just say what you got, man.

515
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,632
A few things that may fit.

516
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,275
Do you remember I told you that Bumpy
was doubling his crews up in Harlem?

517
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,156
So?

518
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,196
VlC: So, downtown we get some visitors.

519
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,759
Three guys from LA, two from Phoenix,
a guy from Decatur, lllinois...

520
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,950
...four guys from Philly.
Altogether about 15 that we're sure of.

521
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,875
Special guys, huh?

522
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,155
VlC: All suspected being guns
for the Mafia.

523
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,833
Just got into town.

524
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,470
Most of them staying at a hotel
in the Village. Taking in the sights.

525
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,075
Is that it?

526
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,878
No, one thing more.

527
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,917
A couple of dudes from Harlem
go across to Jersey.

528
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,313
Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig.
They blew it.

529
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,237
VlC: They killed the guy's runner.

530
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,312
But the man says his runner
was in Florida on a fishing trip.

531
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,674
SHAFT: Looks like war coming.
VlC: It's a bad thing.

532
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,472
Mafia against Bumpy.
It's hood against hood, on the inside.

533
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,716
On the outside, it's black against white.

534
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,428
We could have tanks and troops
on Broadway if this thing breaks open.

535
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,677
Yeah, you got a point.

536
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,920
This is what some of our visitors look like.

537
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,992
SHAFT: Be a good time for it.

538
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,229
VlC: What? War?

539
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,590
SHAFT: [Chuckles] Fishing down in Florida.

540
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,639
VlC: It might help if I knew
what Bumpy hired you for.

541
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,592
-Never said he did.
-He did.

542
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,429
It's against my ethics to say yes or no.

543
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,469
-He put you on the spot, Shaft.
-He did?

544
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,911
You're a very wise Caucasian, Vic.

545
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,948
I'll be here. If I'm not, call me at home.

546
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,559
That's a comfort.

SHAFT: Hello, baby.

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,154
[Sighs] I waited up.

550
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,035
-Sorry, I can't make it.
-Got problems?

551
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,118
Yeah, I got a couple of them.

552
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,469
I was born black and I was born poor.

Yeah, I know.

00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,594
Take it easy.

557

Hey....

558
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,715
SHAFT: Get up.

559
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,999
We've got a man to see.

560
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,429
Yeah.

See who that is, will you?

564
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,514
SlMS: It's Shaft.

565
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,914
Let him in.

566
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,352
-I have an appointment with Bumpy.
-I know all about it.

567
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,473
I've got to see if you're clean
before you can see the man.

568
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,955
Better get yourself six more helpers then.

569
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,599
That's how it's done.

570

Who searches you?

571
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,555
Nobody.

572
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,675
Then get the same cat to search us.

573
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,198
I've got to see if you got a gun on you
before you go in.

574

Tell Bumpy we were here. Come on, Ben.

walk now, Willy?

You ride a tall horse, Mr. Shaft.

This is Ben Buford. Your little caper
cost him five friends last night.

-You're pushing me a little far.

I found out some things, Bumpy.

594
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,074
You knew who grabbed your daughter,
and that it wasn't Ben or his people...

...when you laid all that jive on me
in my office.

I still don't know who has her.

Now, deal them up straight,
or don't deal them at all!

from the Mafia.

BEN: Made yourself some big bread.

Now the Mafia wants to move in on you.

So what?

603
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,877
So, the Mafia grabbed your daughter.

SHAFT: You knew it.

605
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,472
You knew it when you hired me.

Yeah.

607
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,630
You tried to snatch one for a trade.

608
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,316
But your flunky friends out there blew it.

609
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,873
They burned some kid. Missed the man
we wanted to grab for a trade.

but I never lied to you.

A lot of hyped-up black people give you
that money you're spending, pimp!

would come after me, didn't you?

But it doesn't shake me up.

623
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,829
They made a good move
to take out my front man.

624
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,195
They'll probably try again. I would.

00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,868
You been using me, Bumpy. Suckered me.

626
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,480
That's okay. We stood face to face.

627

But, I want to know why you wanted me
to hook up with Ben.

'Cause you're gonna need an army
to get my baby back.

outside of Harlem.
