1
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,111
- Up yours!
- Get out of the way!

2
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,313
Fine time piece, brother?

3
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,189
Goodbye.

4
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,114
"Who's the black private dick
that's a sex machine to all the chicks?

5
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,829
"Shaft

6
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,634
"Damn right

7
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,632
"Who is the man that would risk his neck
for his brother man?

8
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,229
"Shaft

9
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,233
"Can you dig it?

10
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,594
"Who's the cat that won't cop out
when there's danger all about?

11
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,595
"Shaft

12
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,075
"Right on

13
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,350
"They say this cat is a bad mother

14
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,475
"Shut your mouth

15
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,879
"I'm talking about Shaft

16
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,552
"Then we can dig it

17
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,636
"He's a complicated man

18
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,675
"No one understands him

19
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,311
"But his woman

20
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,753
"John Shaft"

21
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,638
What's happening, Marty?

22
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,075
Same old sixes and sevens, Shaft.

23
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,119
Two guys were looking for you
like 10 minutes ago.

24
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,514
Harlem cats?

25
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,192
How the hell should I know?
Everybody looks the same to me.

26
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,479
Take it easy, Marty.

27
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,233
Take care, Shaft.

28
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,319
Thanks, brother.

29
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,597
Too much sugar this morning.

30
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,839
Then don't drink it, baby.

31
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,599
A couple of dudes from uptown
looking for you.

32
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,029
Know them?

33
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,229
Not by name.

34
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,116
Seen them around uptown.
Come in here when I was opening up.

35
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,791
Asked where they could find you.

36
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,839
What did they look like?

37
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,037
One was wearing a funky plaid coat.
Other one was sharp.

38
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,550
$50 shoes. Black coat, gray flares.

39
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,830
- Is that all?
- They had heat on them.

40
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,112
The one in the plaid coat
had his hands in his pocket.

41
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,236
Pulled his coat tight, you dig?

42
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,751
Had some heavy iron in his belt.

43
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,754
You got a scuff on the
toe of this left shoe.

44
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,838
What time you got, Tom?

45
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,350
8:16.

46
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,439
Pull over in front of that shoe-shine
parlor. He usually hangs out there.

47
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,596
Okay.

48
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,115
- You want me to go in?
- No. We'll wait.

49
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,552
Got yourself a nice shine. You can go out
and make something of yourself, man.

50
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,434
Go out and get rich and fat like you?
We're straight, baby.

51
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,673
Got a minute, Shaft?

52
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,634
Got no use for no dirty postcards, Vic.
Get off my back.

53
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,638
I just want to talk to you.

54
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,995
Call me up. You know my number.

55
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,949
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Go sit in the park a minute?

56
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,077
Hell, no. Just tell me
what you got to say right here!

57
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,311
Tom, go get us two cigars.
What kind do you smoke?

58
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,511
Just say what you've got to say.

59
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,635
Get us a couple of El Garcia's.

60
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,039
Look, I'm late.

61
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,030
What are you trying to lay on me?

62
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,714
Just love, Shaft.
Nothing but love and sympathy.

63
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,837
Then we're even. Go on, get on with it.

64
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,880
I thought you might know something
I want to know.

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,117
Seems there's been a lot of low,
quiet rumbles going on uptown.

66
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,909
Our people have been able to pick up
the sounds of it, but not words.

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,072
That's 'cause us black folk
talk mush mouth, Lieutenant.

68
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,359
I thought we'd get to it.

69
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,069
We did. But, you want me to pigeon.
I just said, "Up yours, baby."

70
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,511
How come two cats from Harlem
came downtown this morning...

71
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,318
...looking for John Shaft?

72
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,429
They're soul brothers. They came down
so I could teach them the handshake.

73
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,354
They find you?

74
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,192
Of course, I wasn't hiding.

75
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,916
If you find out anything, give me a call.
I'm still at the 38th Precinct.

76
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,075
Right on.

77
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,237
Where the hell are you going?

78
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,914
To get laid. Where the hell are you going?

79
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,390
That boy's got a lot of mouth on him.

80
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,029
The boy's man enough to back it up, too.

81
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,918
What did he tell you?

82
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,349
Nothing.

83
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,512
Got to lean on that kind.

84
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,271
You don't lean on that kind.

85
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,472
Give me a package of gum.

86
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,711
Make a noise, I'll cut you. Back up.

87
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,360
- Something wrong, Mr. Shaft?
- Sick friend here.

88
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,317
Jim, can you get us a car up?

89
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,559
I'll take that.

90
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,639
Now, be cool, man.

91
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,272
Where is your partner?

92
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,474
Open the door.

93
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,199
You've got about a half a minute
to tell me what the hell you want with me.

94
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,068
The police will ask why you threw
that son of a bitch out the window.

95
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,430
They can find you dead or alive.
Now, what's your goddamn story?

96
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,435
Bumpy...

97
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,908
Bumpy says to bring you uptown.

98
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,311
Did he tell you to mess me up?

99
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,313
I was to bring you.

100
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,519
It doesn't make sense.

101
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,478
You arrive at your office.
You have a sick friend with you.

102
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,711
Suddenly, another man you don't know
rushes up and a fight starts.

103
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,798
Your sick friend goes out the window.
Why, Mr. Shaft?

104
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,593
Ask the man who started the fight,
Mr. Leibowitz.

105
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,354
Your friend, the only name
you know him by is "Tex"?

106
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,311
- No last name?
- That's right.

107
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,719
I don't buy that, Shaft.

108
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,554
I think you know more than that.
Why the fight started, for instance.

109
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,598
What you think and what you can prove
are two different bags.

110
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,719
All your friends walk around
with weapons like that?

111
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,148
That depends.

112
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,198
My Negro friends don't walk around
with rabbits' feet no more.

113
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,352
Don't get wise with me.
There's a simple way for me to go.

114
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,109
- I'll put your goddamn ass in! - I'll
sue your goddamn ass for false arrest.

115
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,158
You want me to believe the man fell out
the way you said he did?

116
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,153
- What do I look like? Some kind of klutz?
- Don't ask, and I won't tell you.

117
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,470
You're licensed by the city and the state.

118
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,149
No one licensed can afford to be a wise ass
where a felony case is involved.

119
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,317
Are you suggesting I'd lose my license?

120
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,437
You are damn right I am!
You better believe it and level with me!

121
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,312
Threatening my livelihood is a violation
of my rights, isn't it?

122
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,829
Byron...

123
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,629
Let me have a talk with him in private.

124
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,350
You got an assailant to interview.

125
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,710
Start that and I'll join after we talk.

126
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,349
I think you are b.s.-ing me, too.
This thing stinks.

127
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,198
Maybe he didn't like the handshake
you taught him.

128
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,838
You know you can get your rump
in a sling for this mess?

129
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,718
- Static, a lot of hassle.
- You'll save me, Vic.

130
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,033
Well, I can try.

131
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,076
If?

132
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,872
One hand washes the other.

133
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,474
All the hassle in the world wouldn't
make me sing a song to the police.

134
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,355
No way, baby.

135
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,078
That cat you threw out the window
was a flunky for Bumpy Jonas.

136
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,395
I didn't throw no cat
out no window, Lieutenant.

137
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,232
Bumpy isn't gonna like it.

138
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,871
I don't care what he likes!
What the hell are you pumping me for?

139
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,110
Two weeks ago
we started picking up rumbles.

140
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,518
- You already said that.
- We know it's not the Panthers.

141
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,398
Or the Young Lords.
But, something's on the boil.

142
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,192
I want to know what it is...

143
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,437
...before we need an adding machine
to count the bodies.

144
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,511
Bumpy wants you for something.

145
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,791
He knows what's going on.
And that's what I want to know.

146
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,839
Not who, just what.

147
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,993
It warms my black heart to see you
so concerned about us minority folks.

148
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,429
Come on, Shaft.
What is it with this black shit?

149
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,959
You ain't so black.

150
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,830
And you ain't so white, baby.

151
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,669
All right.

152
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,433
You want to play
your super heavy black number.

153
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,798
I'm gonna play mine.

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,073
We can nail your tail for manslaughter
with what we've got on you right now!

155
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,593
You can waltz Leibowitz, but you
know the law. You could be charged.

156
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,759
Charged, Lieutenant.

157
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,149
Yeah, but your license'll be suspended.

158
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,914
You'll be out of business for six months.

159
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,115
You want to be out of business
for six months?

160
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,439
Out on the street.

161
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,829
No gun permit. Six months!

162
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,275
With Bumpy looking for you
when all hell's about to break loose?

163
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,679
You want it, you got it.

164
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,118
You scare me to death, Lieutenant.

165
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,954
You're buying trouble not only for
yourself, but a blood bath up in Harlem.

166
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,950
You want that?

167
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,437
All I'm asking you is to let me know
what's going on!

168
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,876
No names, no places, just what!

169
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,871
I'm not asking you to sell out.

170
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,469
Tell me the name of the game,
so I know the rules.

171
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,319
I'll think about it.

172
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,397
All right, I'll settle for that now.

173
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,750
That buys you 48 hours on the street,
and then we're gonna talk again.

174
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,433
You got the number
of Bumpy's private phone?

175
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,789
All right.

176
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,790
Take off. I'll see to Leibowitz.

177
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,155
Right on.

178
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,234
I'll see you.

179
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,554
Look at that.

180
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,832
- Wrong number.
- Don't bull me, I got the right number.

181
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,069
This is Shaft.

182
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,957
How did you get this number?

183
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,600
Off a bathroom wall
in the goddamn subway.

184
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,598
I'm looking for you.

185
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,433
I've got an office.

186
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,508
Here you are.

187
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,869
Thanks.

188
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,634
Bag of chestnuts, please.
Cold as hell today, huh?

189
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,480
Yeah, yeah. Good chestnuts.

190
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,509
How much?

191
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,715
Two bits.

192
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,677
- Here you go. Take it easy.
- Thanks.

193
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,875
Hey, taxi!

194
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,678
What the hell is this?

195
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,913
You white mother!

196
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,549
Taxi! Taxi!

197
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,434
Cat say he gonna be here,
he should be here.

198
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,675
Open it up.

199
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,152
Cat say he gonna be here...

200
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,153
...and he ain't.

201
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,310
It ain't right, Boss.

202
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,154
We'll wait.

203
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,032
You take crap off of him...

204
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,271
...he'll give you more crap.

205
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,715
We'll wait.

206
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,392
That's some cold shit...

207
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,314
...throwing my man, Leroy,
out the window.

208
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,149
Just picked my man up, and threw him
out the goddamned window.

209
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,150
Got us standing around and waiting
to say thank you.

210
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,831
Glad you let yourself in, Bumpy.

211
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,233
Give me a bad name,
have you hanging around in the hall.

212
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,196
If the man ever comes down here...

213
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,518
...again to see you...

214
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,270
...you make sure you be here.

215
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,349
Waiting.

216
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,713
You're in my chair.

217
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,594
Wait outside.

218
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,629
Sims and Leroy tried to muscle you, Shaft?

219
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,550
Well, I got no grudge about Leroy.

220
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,353
I couldn't give a damn.

221
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,874
I got a job for you.

222
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,678
I'm not on the hustle, Bumpy.

223
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,995
A detective job.

224
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,270
- What kind?
- Your kind. You take it.

225
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,190
Don't jive me. What are you talking about?

226
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,555
Somebody kidnapped my daughter, Marcy.

227
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,512
Done in a couple of people.

228
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,831
Didn't leave no ransom note or nothing.
Nobody saw nothing.

229
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,273
I want you to find her.
That's the fucking job.

230
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,431
The police do that for free.

231
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
Not for me. You know I can't go
to the cops.

232
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,873
And you want me?

233
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,994
The spade detective.

234
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,193
Yeah, I want you 'cause
you're a black spade detective.

235
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,751
I want you 'cause you got your other foot
in whitey's trough! She can be anywhere.

236
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,078
Got any idea who grabbed her?

237
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,157
A lot of cats hate my guts.

238
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,273
A sweet, loving dude like you?

239
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,318
Sweet talking a man's lady...

240
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,876
...as you beat her man out of his paycheck
in the back room of a horse parlor?

241
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,076
Feeding his kid shit to shoot in his arm?

242
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,312
Who could hate you, Bumpy?

243
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,919
My baby never sold nothing to nobody.
Never took nothing from nobody.

244
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,679
She's a straight kid.
She's going to college.

245
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,834
Whoever grabbed her, got her to get at me.

246
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,351
They have a beef with me,
they should come to me.

247
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,268
So you got a rule
that somebody else don't.

248
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,358
Is that all you know?

249
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,399
There's a piece of Harlem I can't get at.
The one them militants got their arm on.

250
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,550
They could have my baby.
She's been into some of that stuff.

251
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,993
Bunch calls themselves the "La Mumba's."

252
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,153
Ben Buford's thing.

253
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,196
I could send my people to ask them.

254
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,315
Shit.

255
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,352
It'd come to a shootout and when
it's all over, a bunch of dead cats.

256
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,553
And maybe they'd kill Marcy.

257
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,556
Yeah, you're Papa pimp to them.

258
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,156
They want to see you burn
as bad as they want to see the police burn.

259
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,995
But kidnapping sisters,
that ain't their thing.

260
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,918
The only reason anybody grabs
anybody for is money.

261
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,079
What other bunch in Harlem needs money
bad enough to grab my baby?

262
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,948
If you believe that, what's all this
about me having a foot in whitey's trough?

263
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,077
I said I think they had her.
I didn't say they had her in Harlem.

264
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,754
They ain't dumb enough
to take her someplace uptown.

265
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,834
It don't lay right.

266
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,872
What the hell you think I need you for
if I knew who had her?

267
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,428
I'm guessing.

268
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,830
If they don't have her, all right.

269
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,838
Maybe they know something.

270
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,233
I got nothing.

271
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,598
That's the job, Shaft.

272
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,399
Will you take it, or no?

273
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,352
I get $50 an hour.

274
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,754
Plus expenses.

275
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,910
And no questions asked
about how I spend it.

276
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,395
You got it.

277
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,034
I get a free hand to move any way I want.

278
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,952
You find my baby.

279
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,399
That's all I want.

280
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,634
I got money.

281
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,034
You spend it.

282
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,513
And you find her.

283
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,958
That'll get you started.

284
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,838
When will I hear from you?

285
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,671
When I got something to say.

286
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,553
One more thing:

287
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,957
You send another cat after me with a gun,
I'll kill him and I'll come looking for you!

288
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,838
And I'll get you, Bumpy.

289
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,268
You believe it.

290
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,394
Fake mother.

291
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,071
"Black man born free"

292
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,918
You seen Ben Buford around?

293
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,429
"The way it's supposed to be

294
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,990

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,837

"It's got plenty of names
'Slums"'

298
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,758
Ben Buford used to live here.
He live here anymore?

299
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,589
No, why?

300
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,873
I'm looking for him.

301
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,428
I am, too. He owes me six months' rent.

302
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,393
Take it easy.

303
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,317
"Any kind of job is hard to find

304

"Little boy who needs a pair of shoes"

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,676
Hello, ma'am. I'm looking for a guy
named Ben Buford. You know him?

311
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,079
Yeah, I know him.

312
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,879
- Seen him around here lately?
- Not in a long while.

313
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,997
"Some of the brothers got plenty of cash

320
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,508
I'm looking for Ben Buford.
You seen him around?

321
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,358
No, I ain't seen him.

322
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,269
Thanks.

323
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,475
Know what the number was today?

324
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,588
"Every Sunday morning

- What's happening?
- Man, how's it going?

336
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,515
Seen Ben?

337
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,073
Ben? Ben who?

338
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,472
Ben Buford. You know who I mean.

339
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,959
Look, man, I don't know no Ben Buford.

340
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,470
$20.

341
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,398
That Ben Buford.

342
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,917
He's holed up on a place
on Amsterdam, 710.

343
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,797
What apartment and what time?

344
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,357
Third floor. There's a meeting at 9:00.

345
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,793
I can't guarantee it.

346
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,915
I just heard some cat tell another cat.

347
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,951
They're both in the movement with Ben.

348
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,157
Yeah, well, stay loose, baby.

349
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,999
You all right?

350
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,598
Baby, are you all right?

351
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,595
I got to feeling like a machine.
That's no way to feel.

352
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,119
Come here, baby.

353
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,034
Had a visitor from uptown this afternoon.

354
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,674
What're you having?

355
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,518
A dog with mustard and onions.

356
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,310
No.

357
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,719
Hold the onions.

358
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,195
Cold, huh?

359
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,792
Well, John, what did you get?

360
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,834
I got laid.

361
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,756
Uptown, brother. Amsterdam Avenue.
Take your time. I'm early.

362
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,159
Champ, you lost?

363
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,156
No.

364
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,679
You live around here?

365
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,670
Yeah.

366
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,274
You look cold.

367
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,393
Get something to eat.

368
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,999
Gee, thanks, mister.

369
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,594
Okay, champ.

370
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,591
- Who is it?
- John Shaft, Ben.

371
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,789
Unless you want more visitors,
better split up that pair out front.

372
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,876
Put somebody on the basement door.

373
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,154
How did you find me?

374
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,674
Wasn't hard. You got a big mouth.

375
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,989
- Cool it, man.
- You cool it, boy.

376
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,874
Don't let your mouth
get your ass in trouble.

377
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,880
- I got nothing to say to you.
- Don't jive me.

378
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,874
- We've put in a lot of street time
together. - That was a long time back.

379
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,958
I don't know you no more.

380
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,231
A lot of hard years, man.
The kind you don't forget.

381
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,789
Now, I'm gonna give you one minute
to say what you came here to say.

382
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,555
Then you go back out that door
you came in or I'll throw you out.

383
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,279
You know Marcy Jonas?

384
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,396
- Yeah, why?
- You know where she is?

385
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,155
- What do you mean?
- Somebody grabbed her.

386
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,391
Bumpy thinks maybe it was you.

387
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,276
We don't do that kind of thing.

388
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,237
You know anything about it?

389
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,030
Tom, you used up your minute. Get out!

390
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,553
Don't "Tom" me, man!

391
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,952
- Where are the guns?
- None here.

392
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,473
I'll be goddamned!

393
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,752
Sonny! Sonny!

394
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,069
They're coming!

395
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,838
- Up on the roof?
- Yeah. Go!

396
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,075
He's dead.

397
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,513
Come on, come on!

398
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,398
Not the roof, this way!

399
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,915
Stand back.

400
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,390
- What is this?
- Everything will be fine.

401
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,318
- What is this?
- Go over there and be quiet.

402
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,753
Everything's okay, ma'am.
No need to worry.

403
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,953
Sorry about your door.

404
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,032
That'll take care of it.

405
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,393
You set us up, man!

406
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,118
Young man, please.

407
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,468
Don't do that.

408
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,430
Don't ever threaten me again!
And don't call me Judas!

409
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,552
Come on. It's no time
to count your dead. Come on!

410
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,910
Look.

411
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,989
Come on!

412
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,079
This way, this way!

413
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,354
One of yours?

414
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,392
- No.
- Probably a finger man.

415
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,555
When you lead that revolution,
whitey better be standing still...

416
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,236
...'cause you don't run
worth a damn no more!

417
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,679
We're done running, man.

418
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,035
What the hell do you call this, man?

419
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,512
I got to find out if
they're after you or me.

420
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,918
I'll leave you with some friends.
They're straight people.

421
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,152
So don't you lay any of
that Uncle Tom jive on them.

422
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,194
I don't know what's connected to what.
I can't piece them together.

423
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,429
Answer that.

424
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,712
It's only a half an hour since it happened.
How could I have something this soon?

425
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,316
I'm not paid enough to worry about what
the Commissioner or the Mayor thinks!

426
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,710
It's Shaft. You want to talk to him?

427
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,314
I got a call. I might have something.
Hold on.

428
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,477
No, better I call you back.

429
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,078
I'm coming to see you.

430
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,671
You've been holding out on me.

431
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,350
I'll wait. Listen, several cats
were killed in Harlem.

432
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,998
You know anything about it?

433
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,798
I was there, Lieutenant.

434
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,398
The Captain's at home. Call him back.
Tell him I left to chase down a lead.

435
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,711
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Just get him off my back.

436
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,314
A reporter from the News
wants an interview.

437
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,590
Tell him to call the Captain.
Serves the old bastard right.

438
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,349
This is that list
from the intelligence section.

439
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,959
What about the pictures?

440
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,191
They're getting them together now.
Said about five minutes.

441
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,748
Shaft's coming down. Send him right in.

442
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,151
Dina'll get you a bed made up.
Why don't you get some sleep, man?

443
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,390
Got some dead brothers laying out there.

444
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,031
And this ain't where I should be.

445
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,796
Till we find out why they're dead,
this is the only place for you to be!

446
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,633
You think like a white man!

447
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,233
You don't think! You want to get wasted?

448
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,799
If that's what it takes!

449
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,757
Marvin's sleeping.

450
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,313
I'll find out what I can and pick you up
in the morning.

451
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,590
If you think I'll owe you for this,
you're wrong.

452
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,233
You got nothing I want!

453
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,912
You can have the girls' room.

454
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,154
I got to go out. Got an extra key
so I don't wake you when I come back?

455
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,269
This'll open the downstairs door, too.

456
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,233
Watch your mouth.

457
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,713
I'll say anything I want.

458
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,074
Not in this house. Not here, you won't.

459
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,595
Have a chair.

460
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,633
I don't like your chair.

461
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,996
You gave me nothing, Vic.

462
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,279
You want to lock me up for manslaughter
'cause someone went out of my window...

463
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,435
...go ahead.

464
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,319
You got no deal.

465
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,357
I have nothing else to give you, then.
That's straight.

466
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,479
What do you got now?

467
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,039
One question first.

468
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,590
Anyone who could've identified those guys
with machine guns got wiped out!

469
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,556
Yeah?

470
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,269
Five of Ben Buford's people
and probably the guy that fingered you.

471
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,714
Me? Are you sure it's me?

472
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,878
I'd be sure if I knew if the guys
were black or white.

473
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,037
I'd make it 80-20 they were after you.

474
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,475
But Bumpy could probably tell you that
for sure.

475
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,118
Just say what you got, man.

476
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,632
A few things that may fit.

477
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,275
Do you remember I told you that Bumpy
was doubling his crews up in Harlem?

478
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,156
So?

479
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,196
So, downtown we get some visitors.

480
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,759
Three guys from LA, two from Phoenix,
a guy from Decatur, Illinois...

481
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,950
...four guys from Philly.
Altogether about 15 that we're sure of.

482
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,875
Special guys, huh?

483
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,155
All suspected being guns for the Mafia.

484
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,833
Just got into town.

485
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,470
Most of them staying at a hotel
in the Village. Taking in the sights.

486
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,075
Is that it?

487
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,878
No, one thing more.

488
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,917
A couple of dudes from Harlem
go across to Jersey.

489
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,313
Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig.
They blew it.

490
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,232
They killed the guy's runner.

491
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,312
But the man says his runner
was in Florida on a fishing trip.

492
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,670
- Looks like war coming.
- It's a bad thing.

493
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,472
Mafia against Bumpy.
It's hood against hood, on the inside.

494
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,716
On the outside, it's black against white.

495
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,428
We could have tanks and troops
on Broadway if this thing breaks open.

496
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,677
Yeah, you got a point.

497
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,920
This is what some of
our visitors look like.

498
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,992
Be a good time for it.

499
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,229
What? War?

500
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,558
Fishing down in Florida.

501
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,634
It might help if I knew
what Bumpy hired you for.

502
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,592
- Never said he did.
- He did.

503
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,429
It's against my ethics to say yes or no.

504
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,469
- He put you on the spot, Shaft.
- He did?

505
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,911
You're a very wise Caucasian, Vic.

506
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,948
I'll be here. If I'm not, call me at home.

507
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,559
That's a comfort.

508
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,159
- Hello?
- Hello, baby.

509
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,149
I waited up.

510
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,035
- Sorry, I can't make it.
- Got problems?

511
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,118
Yeah, I got a couple of them.

512
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,469
I was born black and I was born poor.

513
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,470
I love you.

514
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,395
Yeah, I know.

515
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,594
Take it easy.

516
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,715
Get up.

517
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,999
We've got a man to see.

518
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,796
See who that is, will you?

519
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,514
It's Shaft.

520
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,914
Let him in.

521
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,352
- I have an appointment with Bumpy.
- I know all about it.

522
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,473
I've got to see if you're clean
before you can see the man.

523
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,955
Better get yourself six more helpers then.

524
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,599
That's how it's done.

525
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,274
Who searches you?

526
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,555
Nobody.

527
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,675
Then get the same cat to search us.

528
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,198
I've got to see if you got a gun on you
before you go in.

529
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,315
Tell Bumpy we were here. Come on, Ben.

530
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,232
You gonna let them walk now, Willy?

531
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,392
Bumpy'll have your tail.

532
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,036
Wait here, I'll call in to the man.

533
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,312
What do you want, Willy?

534
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,718
- Shaft's out here with some dude.
- Send them in.

535
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,435
He won't let me see if they are clean.

536
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,114
Let them in.

537
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,473
Go on, you heard him.

538
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,153
Listen, Snow White...

539
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,596
...we're gonna tangle sooner or later.

540
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,273
Did you hear what I said?

541
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,749
Why don't you stop playing with yourself?

542
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,398
You ain't gonna do shit!

543
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,031
You're a cagey spook, Bumpy.

544
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,549
You ride a tall horse, Mr. Shaft.

545
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,877
This is Ben Buford. Your little caper
cost him five friends last night.

546
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,270
- We'll take it out of your ass, pimp.
- You're pushing me a little far.

547
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,191
I found out some things, Bumpy.

548
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,074
You knew who grabbed your daughter,
and that it wasn't Ben or his people...

549
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,595
...when you laid all that jive on me
in my office.

550
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,036
I told you, there was no note.
I still don't know who has her.

551
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,588
You're lying, man!

552
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,593
Now, deal them up straight,
or don't deal them at all!

553
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,188
You grabbed the dope hustle up here
from the Mafia.

554
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,352
Made yourself some big bread.

555
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,596
Now the Mafia wants to move in on you.

556
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,956
So what?

557
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,877
So, the Mafia grabbed your daughter.

558
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,355
You knew it.

559
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,472
You knew it when you hired me.

560
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,636
Yeah.

561
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,630
You tried to snatch one for a trade.

562
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,316
But your flunky friends out there blew it.

563
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,873
They burned some kid. Missed the man
we wanted to grab for a trade.

564
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,637
Then you wanted to hustle old Shaft.

565
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,957
I hired you for a job. I conned you,
but I never lied to you.

566
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,953
My baby was grabbed.

567
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,830
You'll get her back. You bought that deal.
You're gonna live with it.

568
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,158
Not at these prices, baby.

569
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,639
I told you what it costs, it costs.

570
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,710
A lot of hyped-up black people give you
that money you're spending, pimp!

571
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,036
Don't you try to bullshit me, boy.
We're all on the hustle.

572
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,276
I sell broads and dope and numbers.

573
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,199
You sell crap and blue sky.
It's all the same game.

574
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,638
You knew the Mafia cats would come
after me, didn't you?

575
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,992
But it doesn't shake me up.

576
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,829
They made a good move
to take out my front man.

577
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,195
They'll probably try again. I would.

578
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,868
You been using me, Bumpy. Suckered me.

579
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,480
That's okay. We stood face to face.

580
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,952
But, I want to know why you wanted me
to hook up with Ben.

581
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,358
'Cause you're gonna need an army
to get my baby back.

582
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,275
Ben's got one.

583
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,790
My people ain't worth a damn
outside of Harlem.

584
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,793
If you think I'd risk
some of the brothers...

585
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,111
...just 'cause your daughter's black,
you're wrong, man.

586
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,269
We need money.

587
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,350
I got a lot of brothers
and sisters in jail.

588
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,630
Set a price.

589
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,954
$10,000 a head.

590
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,876
That's what the honky government
pays a cat in the Army for insurance.

591
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,199
$10,000 a man.

592
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,548
That's our price.

593
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,635
All right.

594
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,630
You telling me you're willing to lay out
that kind of bread for Marcy?

595
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,633
Don't jive me, man.

596
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,238
I can always get more money.

597
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,028
I only got one baby.

598
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,549
That means you already owe him $50,000
for the men he lost last night.

599
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,789
All right.

600
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,078
We can get a lot of brothers and sisters
out of jail with that.

601
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,673
How many of his you'll need?

602
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,029
Depends on whether
the Mafia will take a ransom.

603
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,349
- They want Harlem, nothing less.
- It ain't yours to give. Not anymore.

604
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,391
Mine or not, it's not gonna be theirs.

605
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,796
All I gotta do is find out
where they've got her and bring her home.

606
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,230
That's it.

607
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,148
If he's worth $10,000, I'm worth $20,000.

608
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,473
You got it, COD.

609
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,917
Half now, half when I bring her home.

610
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,796
All!

611
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,636
Right now!

612
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,354
Half, that's the best I'll do.

613
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,598
You just been hustled, Bumpy.

614
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,759
Deliver the money tonight.

615
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,995
I'll have my boys drop it off.

616
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,639
At these prices, you blow it, Shaft,
I'm not gonna like it.

617
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,432
Not even a little bit.

618
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,559
I thought the money didn't matter to you.
Just getting your baby back.

619
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,198
Money always matters.

620
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,031
This is where I get off, man.

621
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,833
One thing we got to get straight.
If it comes to a fight, we do it my way.

622
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,075
For that kind of bread,
the brothers'll play.

623
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,230
As long as you remember
we owe them five.

624
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,435
I said, my way!

625
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,035
I'll call you.

626
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,910
- Hey, man!
- Hey, Billy? Come here.

627
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,553
- Do me a favor.
- Sure.

628
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,639
- Go up to my place and turn on the...
- Hey, no, man. I've already turned on.

629
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,632
No, Billy, turn on the lights.

630
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,590
Lights.

631
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,557
- About two minutes, okay?
- Got it.

632
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,958
How are we doing, love?

633
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,231
That's nice. Don't make any trouble.

634
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,390
- Johnny!
- What do you say, Rollie?

635
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,518
Gorgeous coat!

636
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,678
How about letting me
take over the bar for a while?

637
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,228
There's nothing I wouldn't do for $20.

638
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,914
Have funzies.

639
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,829
You look ready.

640
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,709
Yeah, okay. Scotch and water, both.

641
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,233
On the house, gents.

642
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,353
And since the house is buying,
I'll have one.

643
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,395
To the big-hearted owner
of the No Name Bar.

644
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,596
Whether he knows he's generous or not.

645
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,829
That's all booze!

646
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,915
Right on.

647
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,994
All booze. One zillion percent.

648
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,995
Hold on.

649
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,669
Hold on.

650
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,110
No, he ain't here. Right.

651
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,952
Ho there, innkeeper?

652
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,990
Two gin and tonics, and a Virgin Mary...

653
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,674
...for moi.

654
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,117
I'm thirsty. Parched.

655
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,632
There's a girl over there...

656
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,228
...with the dark hair
and the groovy boobs...

657
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,352
You really turn her on,
if you're interested.

658
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,954
I ain't dead.

659
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,075
Her friend, Valerie, says she's hot
for my body. I told her I was gay.

660
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,118
You know what she said?
She'd straighten me out.

661
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,758
That's what she said.

662
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,348
It's not enough that I'm lovely,
she wants me to play character parts.

663
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,431
The one with the titillating boobs
is named Linda.

664
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,192
Man can't walk on one leg.

665
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,273
Hate drinking alone.

666
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,552
Vic, private line.

667
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,389
Hey, sweet baby?

668
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,033
This is your lover man.

669
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,638
Who the hell is this?

670
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,873
Two sweet guesses.

671
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,114
That you, Shaft?

672
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,432
You bet your lovely self it is.
And I'm ready. Can you dig it?

673
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,955
Got troubles?

674
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,590
- I got what you want.
- Where are you?

675
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,352
No Name Bar in the Village.

676
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,073
On Jane Street.

677
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,991
- What do you want me to do?
- Haul your beautiful self down here.

678
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,269
How many are there?

679
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,389
About two.

680
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,029
I'll close up and we'll go over to my pad.

681
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,400
You walk in that front door,
I'll close up right now.

682
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,269
- I'll have a car there in a few seconds.
- That's what I want to hear.

683
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,432
A lot of loose stuff around here?

684
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,671
All a man can handle, deacon.

685
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,038
What are you looking at?

686
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,555
Get lost.

687
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,159
Go do something.

688
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,399
Where are my manners?

689
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,555
I didn't even introduce myself
to you gentlemen.

690
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,515
My name is John Shaft.

691
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,389
Freeze!

692
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,479
Throw me a towel.

693
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,039
There's two of them.
We're generous around here.

694
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,919
It's not so bad.

695
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,751
It's a nice pad you got here.

696
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,478
I'm going upstairs to take a shower.
I'll be right back.

697
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,518
I just couldn't wait.

698
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,071
- What do you say, Vic?
- 'Morning.

699
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,078
Both of them had guns,
licenses to carry them.

700
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,228
"Jewelry couriers," the licenses say.

701
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,273
Detroit people.

702
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,710
- Will you turn them loose?
- I have no choice.

703
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,432
They'll leave town.

704
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,239
You'll have strangers looking for you,
not them.

705
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,957
Can I have a private talk with them?

706
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,918
What you'll do to poor Carmen now?
Give him cancer?

707
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,037
You busted his head, settle.

708
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,394
I want to find out his views
on urban renewal.

709
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,189
All right.

710
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,991
I'm speaking for Bumpy Jonas.

711
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,514
He wants to be sure his daughter's okay.

712
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,391
My word is all he'll take.
No phone calls and no letters from her.

713
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,753
I've got to see her.

714
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,118
Then maybe he'll deal.

715
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,109
Nothing I want to say in this rat hole.

716
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,070
- People might be listening.
- That's a risk we'll have to take.

717
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,556
Now give me a number
so I can let you know where I'll be.

718
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,954
I'll call you at 12:30 sharp!

719
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,599
And meet you at 12:45
somewhere in the Village.

720
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,514
Hey, baby?

721
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,831
- Come here.
- Party's over.

722
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,479
You got to split.

723
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,074
Some other time.
Same feeling, same place.

724
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,953
Right now I've got to take care
of some business.

725
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,115
Put Ben on.

726
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,236
He's asleep, who wants him?

727
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,716
Wake him up, it's John Shaft.

728
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,318
You're really great in the sack, but...

729
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,590
...you're pretty shitty afterwards.

730
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,635
I'm trying to take care of some business.

731
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,789
Come on!

732
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,836
I need two good men. Are you ready?

733
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,796
Yeah.

734
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,552
They'd better be tough.

735
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,591
Baby, please close the door.

736
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,318
Close it yourself, Shitty.

737
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,952
- Tell me where and when.
- At Caf Reggio in the Village.

738
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,758
- Know where it is?
- I'll find it.

739
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,195
12:30. Five minutes late would be too late.

740
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,032
I'll be there. 'Bye.

741
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,472
It's Vic Androzzi.

742
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,352
What the hell are you doing here?

743
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,438
I got no time for chats.

744
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,954
You had time for a chat with Carmen
and Patsy in my office this morning.

745
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,110
You got me in one hell of a mess.

746
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,433
- Did you have the room bugged?
- No, not me.

747
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,235
Me? I could turn the other way.

748
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,917
Not hear what I heard.

749
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,872
It's that big-eared Captain I got
who was listening.

750
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,559
He thinks he heard you discussing
a kidnapping.

751
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,636
He thinks the Mafia's involved.

752
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,636
And he knows Bumpy Jonas is involved.

753
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,393
Tell him to ask Bumpy then.

754
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,109
Yeah, I did.

755
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,398
But he wants to ask you.

756
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,318
Now. At the station.

757
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,873
Lousy timing, right?

758
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,633
Gonna take me in?

759
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,748
I will if I find you.

760
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,549
Are you home?

761
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,155
Hell, no.

762
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,433
That's too bad.

763
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,553
Call me when you get home.

764
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,516
I will.

765
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,996
"Close it yourself, Shitty."

766
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,273
This is Shaft. Now get this straight!

767
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,750
I'll be at Caf Reggio
on McDougall street at 12:45.

768
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,630
- Got it?
- Reggio, 12:45.

769
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,550
Right.

770
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,235
Menu?

771
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,035
Espresso.

772
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,039
Don't you want a sandwich
or something with it?

773
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,313
Just espresso.

774
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,235
I hope you don't like lemon peel.

775
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,709
Let it go.

776
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,234
I think you like it. I'll go get you some.

777
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,436
I always forget the lemon peel.

778
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,950
I'm looking for a nigger named John Shaft.

779
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,037
You just found him, wop!

780
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,635
Sit down.

781
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,395
I have to take you to visit a lady.
Come on.

782
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,231
I haven't finished my espresso.

783
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,118
Why don't you have some?

784
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,318
Maybe they'll put a little garlic in it,
if you're nice.

785
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,040
No, thanks. But you go ahead.

786
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,238
We've even got time for you
to have your soul food.

787
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,035
Espresso?

788
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,554
No, thanks.

789
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,915
Keep it.

790
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,119
Thanks, baby.

791
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,435
Let's go.

792
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,835
Come on.

793
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,468
After you, man.

794
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,154
You stay here.

795
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,472
You get around the back, keep an eye
on the alley door. Stay out of sight.

796
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,472
What if they come out our way?

797
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,075
You follow them. Remmy,
you come back for me. Now move it!

798
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,876
No noise. Now, answer me straight.

799
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,959
No lies and no con.

800
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,076
How many men you got in there with her?

801
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,110
Two.

802
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,675
Okay.

803
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,152
When I tell you, you open that door like
this gun was about to blow your head off.

804
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,431
No signal or you're gone. Got it?

805
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,470
Yeah.

806
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,471
Gin!

807
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,629
Open it.

808
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,038
Turn her loose or he goes.

809
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,309
- Tell them to turn her loose.
- He won't.

810
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,710
He won't shoot, Marcy, come here.

811
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,430
There's nothing you can do, Shaft.

812
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,076
Except go back to Harlem
and tell Bumpy his little girl is fine.

813
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,033
- When I leave, she leaves with me.
- No way, Shaft.

814
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,834
She's our ace. You never give up your ace.

815
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,713
Maybe you're right.

816
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,952
I should take you uptown
and turn you over to Bumpy.

817
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,480
Change your mind, you can walk right now.

818
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,473
You try to take the girl or me along,
you're dead.

819
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,718
You trying to tell me they'd blow you away
to get me?

820
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,194
That's right.

821
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,235
I halfway believe you. But, you're my ace,
so I got to call you.

822
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,591
The only thing that's keeping you alive
right now is...

823
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,871
...you got to be fit enough
to go tell that black punk in Harlem...

824
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,316
...that he's got 24 hours to deal
or he's got a dead daughter!

825
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,469
And a war!

826
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,109
You hear me?

827
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,713
Come on, let's go!

828
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,795
Let's go!

829
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,074
Back door.

830
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,909
Come on.

831
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,869
Come on!

832
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,678
You all right? Come on.

833
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,389
Come on.

834
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,833
You all right?

835
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,438
Get me up out of here.

836
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,233
The place'll be stinking with cops
in a minute.

837
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,114
Grab those guns. Let's get out of here.

838
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,434
- Ellie! Ellie, open up!
- Yes!

839
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,998
My God! What happened?

840
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,068
He's been shot.

841
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,833
Put him on the couch.

842
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,354
Didn't want to tell you on the phone.

843
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,432
Ellie, call Sam.

844
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,838
- You need a real doctor, baby.
- I said, call Sam.

845
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,670
Easy.

846
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,189
Blade.

847
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,839
Get on the phone.

848
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,677
We gonna need some more brothers.
With guns this time.

849
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,239
Bumpy'll handle the transportation.

850
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,072
Had to bring you to, Johnny.

851
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,311
Can't fix anything else,
till you tell me where you hurt.

852
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,953
Wall to wall, Sam.

853
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,997
Ellie, give me that phone.

854
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,117
- Get those boys?
- Got eight.

855
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,148
Know where they took her?

856
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,596
One of the brothers tailed them.
He's watching the place now.

857
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,592
What about the back exit?

858
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,229
Everything's cool, baby. Don't worry.

859
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,392
Did you run into a train?

860
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,916
Tight as you can get it.
I got to get up soon as you're done.

861
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,069
Damn, those were some tough white boys.

862
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,955
You're gonna have one hell of a time.

863
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,310
Got a bad sprain on that right wrist.

864
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,356
Tape it.

865
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:55,035
I did, damn it. What do you think I am,
an amateur?

866
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,873
Too good of a job, Sam.
I didn't even feel it.

867
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,789
Wrong number.

868
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,792
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.
I saw Marcy.

869
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,673
Is she all right?

870
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,919
Scared to death, but okay.

871
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,271
I need three cabs,
on the corner of Ninth and Washington.

872
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,715
- To pick up some of Ben's people.
- How soon?

873
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,199
Now, man, now!

874
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,229
Okay, you two! Outside! Move, move!

875
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,355
Let's go!

876
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,154
Tie them up!

877
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,196
All right, where are the uniforms?

878
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,874
- Who's that?
- The night janitor. He's okay.

879
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,359
Use him to find out
which room they got her in.

880
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,389
- Getting it together?
- Yeah, right on.

881
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,475
Beautiful.

882
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,028
Just beautiful.

883
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,512
Jerry, how are you doing, baby?

884
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,709
Hey, boy?

885
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,356
Send up two coffees and a Coke.

886
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,913
Glass or a straw?

887
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,394
For the Coke.

888
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,039
Make it a straw.

889
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,075
Straw?

890
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,193
You heard me, straw.

891
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,599
Right.

892
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,718
You're a shrewd cat, Shaft.

893
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,678
You and your boys blow it
and I'll be one dead cat!

894
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,748
You all know the plan. No mistakes.

895
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,675
Let's go.

896
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,672
There you are, sir.
Two coffees, a Coke and a straw.

897
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,797
- Want me to take it in?
- Whoa.

898
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,915
Right.

899
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,393
Hey, thank you!

900
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,638
- I'll be seeing you.
- Okay.

901
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:35,995
Shut up!

902
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,230
- What do you guys want?
- Your coat.

903
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,873
Rope and harness.

904
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,794
Go ahead down.

905
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,278
Did you hear anything?

906
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,996
This damn thing won't burn hot enough.

907
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,640
You got something else
in there that'll burn?

908
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,914
It's gin, man.

909
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,039
What else you got?

910
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,075
Gasoline.

911
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,869
Come on!

912
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,119
Give me a cigarette.

913
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,631
- You know what to do?
- Yeah.

914
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,592
Let's get out of here!

915
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,149
Come on!

916
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,675
Let's go!

917
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,828
Androzzi, here.

918
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,592
- Vic, your case just busted wide open.
- So close it for me.

919
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,750
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.

920
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:56,152
"You'll have to close
it yourself, Shitty! "

921
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,955
