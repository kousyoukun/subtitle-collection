1
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,436
Lovely!

2
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,751
Beautiful.

3
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,872
You're stoned and you're late.

4
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,877
Quality is "numero uno".

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,916
Is that everything?

6
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,676
Is it everything?

7
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,950
Everything is... You tell me.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,038
Everything is you.

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,549
You are everything.

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,355
Tommy, you are everything.

11
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,349
Today I saw somebody
who looked just like you...

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,871
You're not planning on singing me
through the door, are you?

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,639
I've got a "Corregghio" in here.

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,514
- You're not coming in.
- I fucking am!

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,792
No. Because it's not a Corregghio,
it's Correggio.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,593
Just like
it's not "tacco", but taco.

17
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,598
Not "paster" but pasta.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,875
Your entire education comes
from Classic Car Magazine.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,037
And it's not a Correggio,
it's a fake Rembrandt.

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,312
And until you know that,
you're not coming in with me.

21
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,829
Don't fuck me over here, prat.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,919
Don't threaten me, I'm not
the one wearing an earring.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,475
Who is this?

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,556
I'll be waiting over there.

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,836
Yes, it's Tom Ripley.

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,189
Welcome. I always wanted
to meet the man behind the...

27
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,312
- Scurrilous rumours?
- Reputation.

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,514
- I've heard so many things.
- Some of them may even be true.

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,711
- That's fabulous.
- It's a Guercino.

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,796
Fantastic.

31
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,672
Look at the energy
in that line.

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,155
The two Parmigianino.

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,879
Really stunning.
This is extremely rare.

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,670
Okay.

35
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,951
1,2 million dollars.
That's what we agreed.

36
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,949
- What we agreed?
- Your partner called me.

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,153
- Reeves? - Yes.
- More a pet than a partner.

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,431
He was rather persuasive.
I wanted to pay 900,000.

39
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,749
Since you spoke with him I have
perused them more carefully.

40
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,158
This Rembrandt fake is worthless,
but I'm not discounting for that.

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,798
No, because you'll sell it as genuine
for 800,000, the Guercino 400,000...

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,310
..the Parmigianinos,
650 for the pair.

43
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,433
Add the others and
you'll clear 3 million dollars.

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,953
- I want two million.
- You must be kidding. We had a deal.

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,550
No, you had a deal with Reeves,
not with me.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,558
- 1.3.
- 2 million or forget it.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,990
No. I wish you people
wouldn't waste my time.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,557
- You people?
- Terry, Mr Ripley is leaving.

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,192
Please don't touch those.

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,750
Leave them!

51
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,756
Terry!

52
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,796
- You've killed him.
- Shut up!

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,796
- Don't shoot me.
- Shut up!

54
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,995
Still! Here's the deal. I'll take
your offer, 1.2 million dollars.

55
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,956
But due to the volatility
of the market...

56
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,038
..I'll take several
of the drawings with me.

57
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,552
- Is that clear?
- It's up to you.

58
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,639
That's true.
So perhaps I'll take all of them.

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,676
Would you like to keep the folder?
It's real leather.

60
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,556
Don't follow me.

61
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,559
That is a lovely lcarus.

62
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,951
He flew too close to the sun, no?

63
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,194
Sorry about your friend.

64
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,795
- How did it go?
- Very well.

65
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,879
It takes a long time to count
1.2 million dollars. It's yours.

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,553
- You don't want your cut?
- No. You made the deal.

67
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,357
- What about yours?
- I got the deal because of you.

68
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,359
After you've paid for the drawings,
you'll still have 400,000.

69
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,631
Whoah! It's not that
I don't trust you...

70
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,716
But I don't fucking trust you.

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,956
Fucking hell!

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,998
It's a gift from Professor Ripley's
finishing school. You did well.

73
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,430
Ciao. You're a gentleman.

74
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,397
You're an honest man.

75
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,476
See you.

76
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,751
Italy, three years later.

77
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,194
Fantastico!
It's beautiful!

78
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,154
An incredibly rare piece.
May I ask what you paid?

79
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,636
Yes, you can. How long
to get it ready?

80
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,311
We need at least six weeks
to make it play.

81
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,396
You have 13 days.

82
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,916
It's a surprise.

83
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,589
- Morning.
- I brought the picture.

84
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,312
Good. Thank you.

85
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,195
My wife and I are having
a few people over for drinks.

86
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,233
- You'd be most welcome.
- That's very kind.

87
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,158
It's the third on the left
past the restaurant.

88
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,875
Maybe we'll see you later.

89
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,555
- Delicious! - I mortgaged
the house to buy these truffles.

90
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,550
- So leave a little bit for us.
- I will make risotto.

91
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,638
- The best you ever had.
- I'm sure.

92
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,555
- Is Jonathan here?
- He's in the kitchen.

93
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,590
- Hello.
- Do you know Jonathan?

94
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,793
I'd like to think if I were gate
crashing, I'd be somewhere else.

95
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,310
- Have you met his wife?
- No. - Come.

96
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,070
Sarah, this is Tom Ripley.
Tom, this is Sarah.

97
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,193
- Hi, Tom. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,709
Amarone. The best!

99
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,718
- May I help?
- That'd be great.

100
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,436
- Where's Louisa?
- Preparing her concert for Vicenza.

101
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,633
- Louisa Harari, a very gifted
harpsichordist. - How wonderful!

102
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,719
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks.

103
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,119
I wish I could play something
or paint or do anything creative.

104
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,153
- Who knitted your sweater?
- I did.

105
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,713
- That's very...
- What?

106
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,555
- Creative.
- Mummy.

107
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,759
- This is Matthew.
- Hello, Matthew.

108
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,394
- Is it your birthday?
- No.

109
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,670
- It's Jonathan's.
- Oh, I see.

110
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,878
Have you seen Ripley's place?

111
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,120
Bloody philistine American!
He's ruined that Palladian villa.

112
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,471
Restored the heat
and soul out of it.

113
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,232
That's the trouble with Ripley.
Too much money and no taste.

114
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,677
Oh, hi. You're here then.
We were hoping you'd come.

115
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,234
- Why?
- Well...

116
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,598
To add spice to the evening.

117
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,916
Meaning?

118
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,598
You're a bit of a local personality.

119
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,676
Meaning?

120
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,596
People have heard about you.

121
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,356
Meaning?

122
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,356
Nothing. Just...

123
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,436
Nothing.

124
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,632
What happened to the coffee?

125
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,756
It's coming.

126
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,518
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

127
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,629
Great.

128
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,670
It's what the ltaliano
and English have in common.

129
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,590
Plain simple food.
Eggs in butter, sunny side up.

130
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,878
Mr Ripley!
The lord of the manor himself!

131
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,959
- What a pleasant surprise!
- Come here.

132
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,589
You beautiful man.
I've missed you.

133
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,839
What's the matter with your face?

134
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,594
He doesn't want you to know
he's glad to see me.

135
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,156
Ripley's a Yank, but a Yank
with class. He's got culture.

136
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,236
More than you can say for me.

137
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,832
- But he's overjoyed to see me, eh?
- Absolutely.

138
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,428
Maria, you can go home.

139
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,518
No. She can... Some eggs.

140
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,596
I'm just showing her
some culinary tips.

141
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,556
- She's the best cook in the Veneto.
- I bet, but eggs is eggs!

142
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,753
- Didn't I ask you to never
come near me? - Yes, you did.

143
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,836
Ever.

144
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,355
But I forgive you, Tom.

145
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,637
I trust you were not followed,
my liege?

146
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,358
- I told her to light a fire
in the library. - Lovely!

147
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,989
Remember those drawings in Berlin?
I made 400 grand

148
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,350
and you made several millions.

149
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,436
And here you are.

150
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,911
Professor Ripley's finishing school
nicely tucked away.

151
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,356
I like it.

152
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,236
Please.

153
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,750
Thank you.

154
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,556
You spent the money well.

155
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,516
Always.

156
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,076
There's a lot of wood.

157
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,356
Very flammable!

158
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,949
Oh shit! Bit of greaseproof
and a hot iron should do that.

159
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,594
I'll sort it out for you later.

160
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,596
"Squisito"!

161
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,834
I like your wife, she hates me, so
she's a good woman, you're lucky.

162
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,475
I don't know what I dislike more,
your admiration or your envy.

163
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,229
- It's not envy, I'm doing all right.
- Great!

164
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,670
- I've three clubs and
a restaurant in Berlin. - Great.

165
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,429
Business is good and I don't pay
one penny for protection.

166
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,318
Tell me what you want or a truffling
pig will find you dead somewhere

167
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,396
in a month or two.

168
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,874
Let me tell you something, Tom.

169
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,279
I've got some problem neighbours,
business competitors

170
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,791
that need deregulating.
But I can't be seen to be involved.

171
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,878
Everyone knows everyone in Berlin.

172
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,993
Who died, who did it.
Who's next.

173
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,478
If I want to play it safe, I need
someone who's not connected.

174
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,356
- And you want me to do it?
- Yes.

175
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,995
- Why me?
- Somebody's got to do it.

176
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,035
An outsider ideally, but someone
who knows how to play the game.

177
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,233
Even somebody who's been
on the sidelines for a while.

178
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,272
Why not someone
who's never played?

179
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,599
- 50 grand's a lot for an amateur.
- lnnocence is expensive.

180
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,671
Once you've digested, avail yourself
of one of our lovely local hotels.

181
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,029
You're an arrogant bastard.
Always was, always will be.

182
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,515
- Why was he here?
- He wants me to kill someone.

183
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,438
- Why did he ask you?
- Because I can.

184
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,750
I know you can, silly.
You can sew too.

185
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,479
- Why does he want this person
killed? - I assume he's desperate.

186
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,752
His restaurants are failing,
his nightclub's in freefall.

187
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,111
He's involved in some
squalid turf war.

188
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,791
You can't do that. Run off
to Berlin to assassinate people.

189
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,992
He's a fantasist,
I'm not as assassin.

190
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,713
- How was the party?
- Smashing.

191
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,596
I knew you'd hate it.

192
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,551
Isn't it sad about him?

193
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,071
- Who? - The picture framer.
He's got leukaemia.

194
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,671
- Is drunken pomposity a symptom?
- No.

195
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,033
He's just English.
He's very ill, Tom, he's dying.

196
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,396
It's a shame.

197
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,556
Is it?

198
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,916
Reeves?

199
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,909
I've been reflecting on your problem.
Your talent search.

200
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,271
I might have come up
with someone.

201
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,152
He's as innocent
as a newborn lamb.

202
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,435
I think under all that soft,
white fleece, he might be capable.

203
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,232
- Jonathan Trevanny.
- My name's Peter Wister.

204
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,875
I work for a European
head-hunting agency.

205
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,754
We offer highly lucrative
short-term contracts.

206
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,510
I'm terribly sorry,
you've made a mistake. I'm a...

207
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,909
I'm a picture framer.
I have a small shop.

208
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,670
- No. No mistake. I can assure you.
- How did you get my name?

209
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,069
Can we meet for coffee at
the Cipriani about twelve noon?

210
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,876
I promise you it will be to your
considerable financial advantage.

211
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,469
Organized crime wrecks the lives
of millions of innocent people

212
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,636
and we need to do something about it.

213
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,311
- What exactly are you after?
- The job will take two days.

214
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,149
Then we pay you 50 grand.

215
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,308
- How much?
- 50,000 dollars. Guaranteed.

216
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,671
For two days?
What's the work?

217
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,712
To kill an extremely evil man.

218
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,468
To kill? What?

219
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,830
There's absolutely no risk.

220
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,953
Wait a minute,
this is some sort of a joke.

221
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,551
You think this is a fuckin' joke?
This ain't "Candid Camera".

222
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,036
I'm being straight with you.
A fucking joke!

223
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,793
I'm sorry. But you've definitely
got the wrong person.

224
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,120
- I don't think so.
- Where did you get my name?

225
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,117
We done a search.

226
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,950
If this isn't a joke, it's a mistake.
Please forget you ever met me

227
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,835
and I promise I won't say anything
about this to anyone. All right?

228
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,909
50,000 dollars is a lot of money.
You have a beautiful son.

229
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,039
And you're fuckin' dying
of chronic myeloid leukaemia.

230
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,516
- What?
- It's like I said before.

231
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,517
We do our homework.

232
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,599
If you change your mind,
I'll be here for a couple of days.

233
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,635
- Hello.
- Tom, he's a wanker.

234
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,389
You wanted an innocent,
they come together.

235
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,909
- So he's going to deliver?
- Of course.

236
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,160
- What did you offer him?
- 50,000 dollars like a wanker.

237
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,159
- Double it. I'll pay the difference.
- You have 50,000 dollars?

238
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,956
Are you okay?

239
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,711
- You look pale.
- Just a bit shaky.

240
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,674
What's wrong?

241
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,397
I bumped into a total stranger
who knew I had leukaemia.

242
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,035
- The whole world knows.
- It's a small town.

243
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,435
Yes, I know.

244
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:54,908
- You shouldn't be ashamed of it.
- I didn't say I was.

245
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,630
Don't be so hard on yourself.

246
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,477
- Oh God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

247
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,796
It's okay.

248
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,638
- I'm scared.
- I know.

249
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,070
I just wish
everything were different.

250
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,238
I wish you didn't have that job.

251
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,550
We need the money.

252
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,438
Look... please.

253
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,350
- I apologize for upsetting you.
- Then please leave.

254
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,270
When you come to Berlin, I can get
you to see a top specialist,

255
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,870
absolutely no obligation!

256
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,959
I don't need
another second opinion!

257
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,515
Twice in my life doctors have said
I was dying. But I'm still here.

258
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,949
Look at me.

259
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,832
I'm still here.

260
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,193
I've been authorized
to increase the original offer.

261
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,834
100,000 dollars.

262
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,599
Look... I'm sorry.

263
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,359
Thank you very much for your time.
Please call me.

264
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,037
- Hi. Can I give you a ride?
- No, thanks.

265
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,993
- I'll drive.
- I like to walk.

266
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,475
Indulge me.

267
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,310
- Thanks for the party. How are you?
- Fine.

268
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,637
It's none of my business,
but I know you're not.

269
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,275
I'm sure it can't be easy
to talk about it.

270
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,313
No, it's not
as a matter of fact.

271
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,798
- I did just want to say...
- Thanks. There's not much to say.

272
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,833
- Do you have a specialist?
- Yes. Dr Gianni.

273
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,349
- Where is he?
- Here.

274
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,711
- Here in the clinic?
- Yes.

275
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,751
Oh, I see.

276
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,952
- They're a competent team.
- I'm sure.

277
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,359
- He's a beautiful little boy.
- Thank you.

278
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,430
If I had a little boy like that,
I'd do anything for him. Anything.

279
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,632
- It's what I'm trying to do.
- I'm sure you are.

280
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,116
- Thanks for the lift.
- Cheers.

281
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,758
I didn't realise
the occasion the other night.

282
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,192
Happy birthday. They're a mixture.
Who knows what will come up.

283
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,039
That's the beauty of planting things.

284
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,912
Thank you.

285
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,996
Take care.

286
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,954
I've been thinking of something
someone at the clinic said to me.

287
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,756
I might go and see this man.

288
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,836
I think you should.

289
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,078
Daddy, are you going away for ever?

290
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,955
- Not quite yet.
- But Mummy said you will.

291
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,029
Mummies may be right.
But not this time.

292
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,316
All finished?

293
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,678
"Closed until Monday"

294
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,113
- Is Jonathan away for long?
- No, not long.

295
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,791
- Where did you say he'd gone?
- To Berlin.

296
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,558
I don't know how much you...

297
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,310
How much l... drink?

298
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,152
Bathe? Work out?

299
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,070
- How much you know of his condition?
- Nothing, I'm an innocent.

300
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,955
He has chronic myeloid leukaemia.

301
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,072
My God, I'm so sorry.

302
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,272
Thank you. This opportunity for him
to get a second opinion

303
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,756
came up at
this research foundation.

304
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,839
He doesn't talk about it,
but I know he's angry.

305
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,192
He's angry because he'll probably die
soon, while we go on living.

306
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,278
He's angry to be so young.

307
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,190
He's angry that he might not see
Matthew grow up.

308
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,357
And you? Are you angry?

309
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,673
Sometimes.
I love him completely but...

310
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,798
there's a part of me that will be
glad when it's all over with.

311
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,992
And that's a terrible thing to say.

312
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,069
I don't think you could even say
anything that terrible. Or think it.

313
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,749
What you feel isn't terrible at all.

314
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,830
Jonathan is fortunate to have someone
like you, and I imagine he knows it.

315
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,153
- How was it?
- The exam? Thorough.

316
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,716
- When do you get the results?
- In the morning.

317
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,709
Dr Wentzel's one of the best.
I don't like doctors myself.

318
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,318
This is what we're going to do.
Get your results in the morning,

319
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,433
then you can tell me what you want.

320
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,597
A: I can drive you to the airport.

321
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,678
Or B: we can do the other thing.

322
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,916
The other thing.

323
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,116
Yeah.

324
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,711
Meet me here at 9 o'clock.

325
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,311
Then you can get
a plane home 100 grand richer.

326
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,039
It's your decision.
I'll see you tomorrow.

327
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,875
So?
How was your evening?

328
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,798
Not without interest.

329
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,679
- And how did you play it?
- By ear.

330
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,036
Well I hope.

331
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,590
A nice...

332
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,632
steady rhythm?

333
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,718
I didn't play the whole piece.

334
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,316
No.

335
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,156
Why not?

336
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,115
Turn over and I'll tell you.

337
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,074
No way!
I want to know now.

338
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,555
Turn over and I'll tell you.

339
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,468
Was she too easy?

340
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,315
Turn over and I'll tell you.

341
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,516
Now tell me.

342
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,598
I have your test results. They don't
appear to tell us anything new.

343
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,396
After the bone marrow transplant,
you went into a partial remission.

344
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,592
And then lapsed
to the chronic phase.

345
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,793
These latest tests only show
what I think you already know.

346
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,471
Your situation remains grave. So...

347
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,909
..what do you want of me?

348
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,599
- A future.
- I can't give you that.

349
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,110
It is, I fear, not in my brief.

350
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,037
- How long will you stay in Berlin?
- Not long.

351
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,119
- I wish you luck.
- I may need it.

352
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,993
- How much have you given me?
- 50 grand up front, 50 grand later.

353
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,510
If you weren't so polite,
you'd count it.

354
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,910
- So how do you use this thing?
- You screw that into the barrel.

355
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,477
- What, like this...
- Yes, just screw it.

356
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,833
- And where do I shoot him?
- Just point it and pull the trigger.

357
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,677
It's him. He usually wears those
horrible gold-rimmed glasses

358
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,954
and a great big Russian furry hat.
They killed three bears for that.

359
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,436
His name is Leopold Belinsky,
a fucking Russian.

360
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,028
He left Moscow a year ago.

361
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,312
Running prostitutes and drugs
out of his clubs.

362
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,310
The prostitutes keep getting younger
and the drugs keep getting harder.

363
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,195
This scumbag is totally
out of order.

364
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,519
You take him out and decent people
will call you a fucking saint.

365
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,030
Once a week, regular as clockwork,
he visits the zoo.

366
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,719
He always ends up in the insect room,
where his real friends are:

367
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,789
bugs, creepy crawlies, slimy things
just like himself.

368
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,876
That's where you'll find him.

369
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,318
There's no one else
there at that time.

370
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,074
Kids are all at school.

371
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,432
- Excuse me, sir.
- I just came to get my things.

372
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,958
No, stay. I'm just going.

373
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,235
Hello?

374
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,319
Hi, Tommy! Guess what.

375
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,389
Your wanker, he did the business.

376
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,591
Jonathan?

377
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,910
Hello.

378
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,111
- I expected you in the morning.
- It is morning.

379
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,596
It's so great to be back.

380
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,676
It's beautiful.

381
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,436
We can't afford this.

382
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,996
So what did he say?

383
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,033
- What did who say?
- The specialist.

384
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,878
Oh, him...

385
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,070
Well... he said...

386
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,429
Nothing's changed.

387
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,915
It's no worse!

388
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,436
Hello!

389
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,554
- How are you?
- Very well, thanks. You?

390
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,518
I've found something to go
in the downstairs powder room.

391
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,269
- Sarah said you called round.
- Yeah, we missed you.

392
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,949
- You went to Berlin.
- Yeah.

393
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,039
- Productive trip?
- lnteresting.

394
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,229
What do you make of these?
For a hallway?

395
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,630
Nice!

396
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,639
- Very nice!
- I thought so.

397
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,797
Matthew, have you finished?
I have to get ready for work.

398
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,869
Big boys eat their cereal.

399
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,477
- Okay.
- Who was that?

400
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,036
- Wrong number.
- Again?

401
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,636
No, no. More.

402
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,548
How are you doing? No, more.

403
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,150
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. - More!

404
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,156
How do you feel?

405
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:08,279
- All I want is what you owe me.
- This is fucking fantastic!

406
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,278
Please may
I have the rest of my money?

407
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,395
- Thank you.
- Want some more?

408
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,354
- More what?
- More of what you fancy.

409
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,914
You can turn money into all sorts.

410
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,559
Listen, I couldn't...

411
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,639
What I did, I wouldn't...
I couldn't do it again.

412
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,596
Shame! There's another 50 grand...
And so much easier.

413
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,513
I'd rather we didn't meet again.

414
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,555
In matters like this, the trouble
starts when the job is half done.

415
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,037
Even bastards have friends.
Even dead bastards.

416
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,832
- What are you talking about?
- You can't shoot people...

417
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,078
..without tidying things up.
Not if you value your life.

418
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,471
My life?

419
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,672
I wouldn't go on any family picnics
if I was you.

420
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,433
- Where were you?
- I took the car to the garage.

421
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,518
But it isn't worth repairing.

422
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,396
Great.

423
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,789
So what do we do?

424
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,390
We...
buy a new one.

425
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,036
- With what?
- There's something...

426
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,472
..I've been keeping from you.
- I know.

427
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,311
This medical research foundation

428
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,830
gave me a few thousand dollars.

429
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,315
But I have to go back.

430
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,191
- What for?
- They're doing a clinical trial...

431
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,880
..with a new drug.

432
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,070
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want you to worry.

433
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,112
- Because it's dangerous?
- No.

434
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,631
It just might not work.
But at least we'd have a car.

435
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,479
They're paying you because
there's a risk.

436
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,912
There is no risk.
And it wouldn't be for long.

437
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,071
Don't go.
We don't need a car.

438
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,156
Hello.

439
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,998
I need to talk to you. Outside.

440
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,678
Fuck!

441
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,715
"Scusi".
Please, it's a beautiful song.

442
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,196
Hello. I know,
I'll call you later. Later!

443
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,276
Here you are.

444
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,551
It's a garrotte.

445
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,389
- I know what it is.
- Signature of old Belinsky.

446
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,638
When they find it round the neck
of his business rival,

447
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,753
it'll start a war between them,
then I'll have the field clear.

448
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,955
So you want Trevanny to strangle
a Ukrainian Mob boss

449
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,029
on the Berlin to Dusseldorf express
with a piece of dental floss?

450
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,036
Yeah. Well, more or less.

451
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,118
I think we can talk him into it.

452
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,156
He's not going to do it.

453
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,432
- No?
- He did it once.

454
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,431
- And very well.
- Once is enough.

455
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,710
I won't let him.

456
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,752
- No?
- No, game over.

457
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,395
Game over.
Who the fuck are you?

458
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,672
This ain't a game,
it's my fuckin' livelihood!

459
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,556
I said no!

460
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,713
All right.

461
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,756
Hello?

462
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,875
"Please leave a message,
I'll call you back."

463
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,594
You said it was easier.

464
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,748
You didn't mention
strangling anybody.

465
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,873
I couldn't strangle anybody
even if I wanted to. Look at me!

466
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,793
It's not a matter of brute strength.

467
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,994
You apply the right pressure
to the right point. You can do it.

468
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,633
Jonathan... Oh, fuck!

469
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,396
Where the fuck is he?

470
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,356
Fuck!

471
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,556
Just fucking do it.

472
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,949
Otherwise your family's
going to die before you do.

473
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,152
Don't fuck with me!

474
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,470
They're coming.

475
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,676
He takes the train twice
a week for business.

476
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,193
He has prostate problems so he spends
half the trip in the toilet.

477
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,433
You have a master key to it.
That's where you'll do him.

478
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,679
You've got a garrotte
but you've also got a gun. But...

479
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,157
This is very important,
listen to me. It's very important.

480
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,915
You have to use the garrotte.

481
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,429
Let's be optimistic and say
we won't need that.

482
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,392
The noose, please.

483
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,595
Stick around,
I'll need your help.

484
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,071
Has he come back yet?
Jesus!

485
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,953
This is a non-smoking car.
How rude!

486
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:13,269
If he doesn't come back soon, we have
to wait till after Dusseldorf.

487
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,077
Keep my watch. If it breaks,
I'll kill everyone on this train.

488
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,591
I'm going to take him inside.
You wait outside,

489
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,109
say your wife is in there very ill.

490
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,993
Go into the corridor. When he comes
toward you, turn and look at me.

491
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,079
Wait right through these doors
and stop there.

492
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,589
I'll take care of the rest.

493
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,829
I'm sorry... my wife's in there,
she's being sick.

494
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,558
Mr Guleghin?
Is everything all right?

495
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,116
Tom!

496
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,478
- Jesus! Is he dead?
- I don't know.

497
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,796
Get his legs in.

498
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,594
Tom!
The other guy's coming now.

499
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,234
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

500
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,711
Sorry, I don't speak German.
I'm waiting.

501
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,357
Mr Guleghin, are you in there?

502
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:27,039
It never used to be
so crowded in first-class.

503
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,039
Can I have some more?

504
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,635
I don't want to rush you, but the
flight to Milan leaves in an hour.

505
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,639
Please, I've had over 20 minutes

506
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,718
to adjust to becoming
one of Europe's most wanted.

507
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:21,437
I know I must look ludicrous to you
with my heaving, and shaking

508
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,518
and my shockingly awful normalness.

509
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,718
I do hope that you will forgive me.

510
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,798
I can't look at my son!
I can't look at my son!

511
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,391
I can't explain how I made
100,000 dollars.

512
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:47,469
And I really fear I am in fact ill.
I'm not well...

513
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,591
I'm from the lmmigration Authority.

514
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,399
Could you go outside, please?

515
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,069
- All right.
- Thanks.

516
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:05,476
I should thank you, I wouldn't be
alive if you hadn't helped me.

517
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,916
But I can't say thank you.

518
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,518
I don't know anything about you.

519
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,039
Who are you?

520
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,151
I'm a creation. A gifted improvisor.
I lack your conscience.

521
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,671
When I was young that troubled me.
It no longer does.

522
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,076
I don't worry about being caught as
I don't believe anyone is watching.

523
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,990
The world is not a poorer place
because those people are dead.

524
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,989
It's one less car on the road,
a little less noise and menace.

525
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:50,114
You were brave today. You put
some money away for your family.

526
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,196
That's all.

527
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,954
If you lack my conscience, then
why did you help me on the train?

528
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,238
I don't know,
but it doesn't surprise me.

529
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,309
The one thing I know is
that we're constantly being born.

530
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,436
But why me?

531
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,518
Why did you pick me?

532
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,717
Partly because you could.
Partly because you insulted me.

533
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,799
But mostly
because that's the game.

534
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,878
We have to get this flight.
Shall we?

535
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,356
What's going on?

536
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,436
Where did this come from?

537
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,679
- You... you wouldn't believe me.
- Try me.

538
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,439
- I won it.
- You won it?

539
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,279
Yes, roulette.

540
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,153
Since when did you play roulette?

541
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,714
- In Berlin.
- Don't lie to me.

542
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,879
Dr Wentzel took us to a casino...

543
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,232
- Is that some kind of therapy?
- We had a few thousand marks...

544
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:59,751
- It's true.
- You won a small fortune...

545
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,078
..and decided to hide it.
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

546
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,237
What were you doing with Tom Ripley?

547
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,033
I met him at the airport.

548
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,152
He offered to give me a lift.

549
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,750
Dr Wentzel has this system.

550
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,395
You bet on the red
and if you lose...

551
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,593
Don't lie to me,
whatever it is you're doing!

552
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,676
- You don't believe me?
- No.

553
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:32,511
I go through all that
exhausting crap with doctors,

554
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,996
hoping against hope,
looking for some glimmer.

555
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,237
Then I get
an incredible stroke of luck

556
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,477
for the first time in my life,

557
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,754
and then you accuse me of lying
to you. You accuse me of lying!

558
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,190
Look!
I have some money.

559
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,437
Money for you
and for me and for Matthew.

560
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,509
And money is what's important,
isn't it? Isn't it?

561
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,598
- Where did you find it?
- In a chicken coop, outside Pisa.

562
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,713
They completely rebuilt the legs
and stripped all the emulsion off.

563
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,031
I can't...

564
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,232
I just can't. Give me a moment.

565
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,596
Stop it!

566
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:41,592
Never touch her again.
She's too good for you.

567
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,676
I know.

568
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,679
- What's wrong?
- One of them's still alive.

569
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,633
- How do you know?
- I heard it on the World News.

570
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:13,232
Jesus! I always figured you
for a Talk Radio man.

571
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,273
I guess I didn't
strangle him long enough.

572
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,518
It's not likely a garrotte
comes with a manual.

573
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,870
One of them got
a very good look at me.

574
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,189
The first rule is don't ever worry
about anything you can't control.

575
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,269
I don't think they can trace us here.
And if they do, I'll let you know.

576
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:41,195
What about my family? I'm
just worried about my family.

577
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,995
If they come for anyone,
they'll come for me.

578
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,069
These Balkan types tend to take
strangling quite personally.

579
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,872
Shit, it's not Reeves!

580
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,556
Where is he?

581
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,195
He was here.

582
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,589
There's another exit.

583
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,830
You get him.

584
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,155
Let the man live.

585
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,429
Let us take this time to pay
a well-deserved homage

586
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,793
to the ever and ever
rising souffle' of Tom Ripley.

587
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,316
Look at that.

588
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,949
- You are the perfect housewife.
- That's true.

589
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,036
I should marry you.

590
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,438
It's okay, leave it.

591
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,994
I already had
three wrong calls today.

592
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,076
Oh yeah?

593
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,836
Hello?

594
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,228
Reeves!

595
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,715
Yeah? How long...

596
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,594
Oh, my!

597
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,554
- Come on.
- What are you doing here?

598
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,355
Don't get arsey, Tom.

599
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,835
So they located you in Berlin?

600
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:17,273
- I don't know how they found out.
- Now you lead them to my house.

601
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:24,511
There's something of the mudslide
about you. You bring everything down.

602
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,117
Fuck you!

603
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,196
Fuck you!

604
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:36,589
- Are you gonna let me in?
- Let you in? No, I don't think so.

605
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,149
- You're on your own again.
- You bastard.

606
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,999
You fucking bastard!

607
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,157
You fucking bastard!

608
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,116
I'll lead them straight to you,
you fucking bastard!

609
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,438
You fucking bastard!

610
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,516
Fuck you!

611
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,638
Fuck you!

612
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,114
How is it? A masterpiece?

613
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,396
Maria, would you like to take
the weekend to visit your sister?

614
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,671
I would like it very much.
Thank you.

615
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,315
My love, maybe you'd like
to go to Vicenza today.

616
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:30,673
You can rehearse in the theatre.
Such lovely acustics.

617
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,358
Yeah.

618
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,709
Fine.

619
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:40,278
- So you'll stay here by yourself?
- Actually I'm expecting company.

620
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,110
- Will they come to the concert?
- No.

621
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,198
They're not music lovers.

622
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,878
- Will I see you there?
- Absolutely.

623
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:41,399
I want you to get rid of anything
that might have my name

624
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,990
or phone number on it.
And do the same with Reeves.

625
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,590
Why?
Are we in trouble?

626
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,429
Yes. Don't phone me
and don't come to the house.

627
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,678
- If you're in trouble, I'll help.
- Stay away. Stay safe.

628
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,511
Did you have a nice day in school?

629
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,278
I've got to go away
for a few days.

630
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,716
I have some business to settle.

631
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,515
I want to fix up something
for after I've...

632
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,598
I don't want to go into it yet.

633
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:34,993
What thing? Don't you think
we should talk about it?

634
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:39,079
Yes, when I get back,
in a couple of days.

635
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,910
Is it to do with Tom Ripley?

636
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,396
- No.
- Jonathan!

637
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,353
I'll be back in a couple of days.

638
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,228
Look, we should talk about this.

639
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,956
- When I get back.
- Great! With another fat envelope.

640
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,676
Shut up!

641
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:47,550
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you might need help.

642
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:54,028
Go home. When they come, there
might be quite a few of them.

643
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,554
I'm staying.

644
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,630
- What did you tell Sarah?
- An assortment of lies.

645
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,309
- Did she believe any?
- I don't think so.

646
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,356
Watch your step.

647
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,436
- What are these?
- Man traps.

648
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,916
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.

649
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,759
- Do they work?
- They work.

650
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,157
Yeah, I think so.

651
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,193
Shouldn't we close the gates?

652
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,278
No, they'll come in anyway.

653
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:52,116
I don't want
to spend my life like this.

654
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,118
- Are you scared?
- No.

655
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,116
I'm fucking terrified.

656
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,399
Come on.

657
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,715
I didn't even think to ask.

658
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,992
With your condition,
can you eat meat?

659
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:12,113
- Yes, I'm just not very hungry.
- You should eat something.

660
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:16,677
You may need your strength.
The meat is fantastic.

661
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,918
It's from the little butcher's
just by the war memorial.

662
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,875
Our cook Maria was once
quite intimate with the butcher.

663
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,958
She got some very nice cuts.

664
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,875
- Think we'll get away with it?
- Why not?

665
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,915
I'm not the sort of person
to get away with things.

666
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,873
At school other kids did,

667
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,992
but not me, I always got caught.

668
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,468
You got caught because you didn't
think of just killing your teachers.

669
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,993
I can't stand this waiting.

670
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,159
When I was a little boy
I waited on the beach for hours

671
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:20,798
for my parents to come back
from a boat ride. They drowned.

672
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,914
I could wait for ever.

673
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,910
Hello?

674
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,600
Tom, this is Sarah.
Is Jonathan there?

675
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,392
- No. Why?
- Do you know where he is?

676
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,033
Why should l?

677
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,630
- Because I think you do.
- Sorry, I don't understand.

678
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,230
- There's something going on.
- I wouldn't worry.

679
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,114
- Don't tell me not to worry.
- Can I call you back?

680
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,470
No, don't hang up.

681
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:07,277
I'm just in the middle of something.
I'll make some calls and ring back.

682
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,630
- Please wait!
- Bye.

683
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,716
Fuck!

684
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,998
Never give
financial advice to friends.

685
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,712
What if they catch Reeves?

686
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,719
They'll never catch Reeves.
Unfortunately.

687
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,277
He'd tell them about me, wouldn't he?

688
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:15,117
Probably.
But he's already in South America

689
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,791
making life miserable for
some unfortunate plastic surgeon.

690
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,748
Check if he's there.

691
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:33,875
Sorry.
It's your breakfast.

692
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,958
- They didn't come?
- Not yet.

693
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,109
Stay in here.

694
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,393
Keep still!
Keep your mouth shut.

695
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:59,198
- I told you to stay inside.
- Is he dead?

696
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:03,279
I don't know and as we know,
I'm no expert.

697
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,992
Jesus Christ!
It's the guy I shot!

698
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,396
You should have stayed dead
the first time!

699
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,150
- Shut up!
- Do you want it off?

700
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,909
I wish he'd stop bleeding.

701
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,756
Do you have a portable phone?

702
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,155
- Yes.
- On you or in the car?

703
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,238
- It's in my pocket.
- Get it out.

704
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:19,355
Call the man who sent you here
and tell him you got a good look,

705
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,517
and we were not
the people on the train.

706
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,871
If you do that convincingly

707
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,073
you walk out of here, we give you
half a million dollars.

708
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,670
If you don't do it convincingly,
I take you out back

709
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,635
and I run my fucking tractor
over your head. Okay?

710
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,354
Do you get that?

711
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,110
Call them.

712
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,716
Calm down.

713
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,790
It's Gregor.

714
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:58,829
I was wrong.

715
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,708
It wasn't them.

716
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,719
I got a good look.

717
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:11,994
We'll keep looking.

718
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,794
Nicely done.

719
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,829
Listen, if we let him go, then...

720
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,711
Yeah, you're right.

721
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,035
Jesus Christ!
Sarah!

722
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,515
Sarah, it's not what you think.

723
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:53,555
We killed him because he was going
to kill us. It was self defence!

724
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,870
Don't touch me!

725
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,678
I'm taking Matthew
and we're leaving.

726
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,956
Sarah.

727
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,674
- Have you got him?
- Yes.

728
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,349
Grab the trunk,
I'll get the other guy.

729
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:31,870
I guess you were wrong
about South America.

730
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,275
Jesus!

731
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,349
Poor Reeves, he won't be getting
plastic surgery after all.

732
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,391
Will you help me?

733
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,034
You take his feet.

734
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,196
One, two, three...

735
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,355
Put his feet way down.

736
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,953
Come on.

737
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,956
Hey, Luigi, it's Tom Ripley.

738
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,035
How are you?

739
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:12,472
Do you happen to have any Chinese
tree peonies in the shop?

740
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,718
Lovely. Pink or red?

741
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:21,558
Terrific, I like the red.
Listen, Louisa's concert tonight

742
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,636
is at Teatro Olimpico.

743
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:29,153
Could we send over four, five dozen
if you have it? I'll drive.

744
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,232
Lovely. Thank you much.

745
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,590
Ah, yeah? How is he?

746
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:40,919
Give him my best.
Thanks again. Bye.

747
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:31,751
Know the most interesting thing
about doing something terrible?

748
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,552
What?

749
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:39,271
Often after a few days
you can't even remember it.

750
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,589
That makes me feel
really, really good.

751
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,673
- The rest of your money.
- No...

752
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,873
As per my arrangement with Reeves.
It's yours.

753
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,675
I'm not sure all this
was about the money.

754
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:14,955
You know what, I doubt it. After
all we're two civilised people.

755
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,517
Now you're officially off
Europe's active hit list.

756
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:23,200
- Thank you.
- Okay?

757
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,671
- Good luck with the wife.
- Thanks.

758
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:33,510
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

759
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,230
- Jonathan.
- Quiet or I'll kill you.

760
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,191
Where's your friend Ripley?

761
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:52,273
Let her go!
Don't hurt her!

762
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,550
- It was me!
- Who brought you here?

763
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,194
I did it on my own.

764
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:58,712
..kill her!

765
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:01,559
Don't hurt her!

766
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,716
- Jonathan!
- Why did you do that?

767
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,629
No, please.

768
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,120
Sarah, in a few minutes
we'll have to call the police.

769
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,959
Tell them there was a burglary.

770
01:37:55,080 --> 01:38:00,029
Your husband came home, there was
a struggle and there were shots.

771
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:03,357
You're in shock,
that's all you remember.

772
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,231
Listen...

773
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:14,195
..take this.
It's the balance of his payment.

774
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,476
He earned it.

775
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,756
If you need...
