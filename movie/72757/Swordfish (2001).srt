【 剑 鱼 行 动 】

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,680
你知道好莱坞的问题吗？
You know the problem with Hollywood?

4
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,350
他们都拍烂片，难以置信
Thev make shit. Unbelievable,

5
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,050
超级大烂片
unremarkable shit.

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,530
我并不是唱高调的导演
I'm not some wannabe filmmaker...

7
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,590
成天抽大麻寻找人生意义
...searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke.

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,600
要挑毛病的话很容易
No, it's easy to pick apart bad acting, shortsighted directing...

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,410
演员、导演和剧本都烂透了
...and a moronic stringing together of words the studios term as prose.

10
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,840
我说的是缺乏真实感
No, I'm talking about the lack of realism.

11
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,740
真实感
Realism.

12
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,250
这不是当今影坛的第一考量
Not a pervasive element in modern American cinematic vision.

13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,150
就拿“热天午后”来说吧
Take Dog Day Afternoon, for example.

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,920
艾尔帕西诺最好的作品
Arguably Pacino's best work.

15
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,360
除了“疤面煞星”和“教父”
Short of Scarface and Godfather Part I, of course.

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,730
导演薜尼卢梅的功力没话说
Masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet's best.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,030
摄影、演员和剧本都是一流的
The cinematographv, the acting, the screenplav, all topnotch.

18
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,510
但是…
But...

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,610
他们没有发挥到极限
...they didn't push the enyelope.

20
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,950
为何不让帕西诺逍遥法外呢？
What if, in Dog Day Sonny wanted to get away with it?

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,020
真的逍遥法外
Really wanted that.

22
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,490
让我们设想一下，要是他立刻杀死人质呢？
Now this is the tricky part. What if he started killing hostages right away?

23
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,200
绝不迟疑、毫不留情
No mercv, no quarter.

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,760
不答应要求，金发美女就死定了
"Meet our demands or the pretty blond gets it in the head."

25
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,430
砰，脑袋开花
Bam, splat.

26
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,430
还是不让步？少来了
What, still no bus? Come on.

27
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,570
他要让多少人质血肉横飞
How many innocent victims would it take for the city...

28
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,200
市政府才肯让步？
...to reverse its policv on hostages?

29
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,840
1976年没有CNN
And this is 1976. There's no CNN.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,780
也没有有线电视或网际网路
There's no CNBC. There's no Internet.

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,190
假如是今天，一样的情况
Fast-forward to todav. Present time, same situation.

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,700
媒体马上就把新闻炒作起来
How quickly would the media make a frenzv? In hours.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,030
从美国到欧洲都是头条新闻
It would be the biggest story from Boston to Budapest.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,370
十名人质丧命
Ten hostages die.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,930
二十名、三十名
Twenty, thirty.

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,770
人质一个接一个被射杀
Relentless. Bam, bim. One after another.

37
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,980
全都被高画质摄影机拍下来
All on hi-def, computer-enanced.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,170
连溅出的脑浆都看得到
You can almost taste the brain matter.

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,950
只为了要一台巴士或飞机？
All for what? A bus, a plane?

40
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,950
或是区区的几百万元吗？
A couple million dollars that's federally insured?

41
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,830
当然不会，我只是想想而已
I don't think so, but... ...just a thought.

42
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,170
当然了
I mean, it's not...

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,930
一般电影不是这么拍，但是…
...within the realm of conventional cinema, but...

44
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,140
假如是呢？
...what if?

45
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,300
你这部电影有一个问题
There's a problem with that movie.

46
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,880
是吗？
Really?

47
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,540
它不会卖座
It wouldn't work.

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,220
为什么？
How come?

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,250
观众喜欢快乐结局
Audiences love happv endings.

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,420
帕西诺拿了钱逃之夭夭
Pacino escapes with the money.

51
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,460
他男友去变性，他们白头偕老
Bovfriend gets a sex change. Live happily ever after.

52
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,690
不行吗？
No?

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,230
不行
No.

54
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,830
你歧视同性恋
Homophobia.

55
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,060
这是道德观念，坏人不能赢
Bad guy can't win. It's a morality tale.

56
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,870
不管怎样，他一定要死
One way or the other, he's gotta go down.

57
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,940
有时候现实比电影更夸张
Well, life is stranger than fiction sometimes.

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,820
大伙儿，我得走了
You know, guys, I gotta go.

59
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,480
我要走了
Gotta jet.

60
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,660
多谢这杯咖啡
Thanks for the coffee.

61
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,510
史丹利，该办正事了
Stan. Time to go to work.

62
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,040
你来不来？
You coming?

63
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,680
让开，我不想再说一遍
Move. I won't sav it again.

64
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,120
我瞄准他了
I have a clear shot.

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,050
狙击手，待命
Shooters, stand by.

66
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,230
好了，现在呢？
Okay. Now what?

67
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,030
别担心，很快就结束了
Don't worry, folks, it's almost over.

68
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,970
－她好了吗？ －好了
- Is she done? - She's done.

69
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,440
－带她出去 －走吧
- Move her out.

70
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,370
放心，你会没事，笑一下嘛
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

71
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,880
很快就回来
You'll be back before you know it.

72
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,210
给我转过来
Turn the fuck around.

73
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,190
救援小组，快走
Rescue team, let's go.

74
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,750
屋顶上有谁？
Who's on the roof?

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,620
狙击手，等待指令
All shooters, you are holding for command.

76
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,000
他们准备开枪
All prepare their shot.

77
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,930
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

78
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,200
我要搞定他
I'm handling this!

79
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,500
别招惹毛这家伙
Don't fuck with this guy!

80
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,210
你会害死人质
You'll get these people killed!

81
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,400
屋顶有两组狙击手
We got two teams on the roof. We got a team over there.

82
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,640
加派人手，以防万一
Double this team up. That's your best angle.

83
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,840
别说话，听我说
Don't talk. Just listen.

84
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,050
22名人质身上
Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped

85
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,350
都有20磅塑胶炸药
with 20 pounds of C-4 explosives.

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,890
还有15磅的不锈钢球
Thev're also taped with 15 pounds of stainless steel ball bearings.

87
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,560
他们是杀伤力最强大的活动地雷
Which makes them the world 's largest clavmore mines.

88
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,760
可以行动了
Thev got the green light.

89
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,460
他在跟我讲电话
I got this guy on the phone!

90
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,730
别理他，我不想跟他耗下去
I'm done plaving with this asshole!

91
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,380
他们就像小狗戴着电击颈圈
Around their necks are radio-frequencv electronic dog collars.

92
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,850
只要走出院子就会遭到电击
Dog walks out of the yard, gets the shit shocked out of him. Same here.

93
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,410
银行就是他们的院子，别搞鬼
This bank is their vard, so don't fuck with me.

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,720
强森，你们到车子中间
Johnson, you and your partner move up between those vehicles.

95
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,990
－站住 －回来
- Stand down! - Get back!

96
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,120
站住
Stand down!

97
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,160
回来
Get back!

98
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,990
马上站住
Officer, stand down now!

99
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,070
他要开枪，他要开枪
He's gonna shoot! He's gonna shoot!

100
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,000
该死
Shit.

101
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,310
去救她
Get her!

102
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,440
快去
Go!

103
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,510
不，放开人质
No! Release the hostage!

104
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,950
不，快放开人质
No! Release the hostage!

105
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,580
她要爆炸了，找掩护
She's gone. Take cover!

106
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,760
不，放开她，放开她
No, no! Let her go! Let her go!

107
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,220
放开人质
Release the hostage!

108
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,930
救救我
Help me!

109
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,660
放开她…
Let her go. Let her go!

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,630
天啊
Jesus.

111
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,180
快躲开
Shit! You guys, come on!

112
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,090
四天前

113
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,810
你打算停留多久？
How long will you be here?

114
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,140
一个礼拜
One week.

115
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,980
公干或观光？
Business or pleasure?

116
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,520
希望都有吧
Hopefully both.

117
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,840
你从事哪一行？
What type of work do you do?

118
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,580
我是电脑顾问
I'm a consultant.

119
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,690
对不起
Excuse me.

120
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,060
请小心点，那些器材很贵
Could you be careful with that? That's expensive equipment.

121
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,910
这要多久？
How long will this take?

122
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,420
只要几分钟
A few minutes.

123
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,520
请坐，我马上回来
Sit down, relax. I'll be right back.

124
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,990
几分钟
A few minutes, huh?

125
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,620
他想去哪里？
Hey, where's he going?

126
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,490
站住

127
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,830
电梯往上
It's going up. Stairs.

128
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,960
走楼梯

129
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,790
请你跟我们来
Sir, could you please...?

130
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,620
冷静点
Easv, easy.

131
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,730
华府

132
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,300
你最好有很重要的事
This better be important.

133
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
不重要就不会找你，参议员
Wouldrt have asked you otherwise, senator.

134
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,630
我们接获消息
We just received word that

135
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,940
艾索托沃入境时被拦下来
Axl Torvalds was intercepted  entering the U.S.

136
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,910
什么时候？
When was this?

137
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,780
两小时前
Within the last two hours.

138
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,750
他在洛杉矶机场的海关被捕
According to my FBI source, he was nabbed in customs at LAX.

139
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,120
他们知道他替我们工作？
Thev know he's working for us?

140
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,450
应该不知道
It 's unlikely.

141
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,550
那是例行检查，托沃一时紧张
It was a routine check. Torvalds freaked out. Thev got luckv.

142

回不了家，也赚不到钱
Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

204
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,020

205
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,850

你女儿？她是我们的女儿

我开始失去耐心了

那我就直话直说

如果你想要女儿就听我说

242

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,000
我把知道的告诉你
I'll tell you what I know.

282
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,290
他存在一个你想像不到的世界
He exists in a world bevond your world.

283
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,230
你的幻想就是他的实现
What we only fantasize, he does.

284
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,630
他没有什么是得不到的
He lives a life where nothing is beyond him.

285
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,920
但是那全是一个假象
But you know what? It's all a feint.

286
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,550
他表面是个风度翩翩的大富翁
For all his charm and charisma, his wealth, his expensive toys...

287
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,790
骨子里却是冷酷无情的杀手
...he is a driven, unflinching, calculating machine.

288
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,630
他只要得到他想要的
He takes what he wants, when he wants...

289
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,670
就消失无踪
...and disappears.

290
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,940
我要怎么找到他？
So how do I find him?

291
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,900
你找不到他，只有他来找你
You don't find him. He finds you.

292
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,150
过程是这样的
Here's how it works.

293
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,210
他的手下接我去找他
His people pick me up. Take me to him.

294
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,250
然后他告诉我该做什么
He tells me what he wants me to do.

295
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,220
我当场完成任务
I do the job right there.

296
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,080
拿了钱就走
I get paid, and I leave.

297
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,660
故事很精采，但你什么也没说
That's a really nice story, but you haven't told me shit, have you?

298
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,710
抱歉，长官，你有电话
Excuse me, sir. You have a call.

299
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,830
帮我留言
Take a message.

300
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,640
是分局长乔伊
It's assistant director Joy.

301
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,410
他说很重要
He said it's important.

302
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,150
我只能说我替他做了什么
I can only tell you what I've done for him.

303
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,920
好吧，这总是个开始
Well, that's a start.

304
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,190
感谢你放了我的当事人
Thank you. You've just let my client go free.

305
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,630
你剥夺他的权利还动手打人…
You denied his right to counsel- -

306
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,170
对不起
Excuse me.

307
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,000
你去死吧
Yeah, and you eat the dick!

308
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,650
分局长乔伊找我，我是罗伯
Yes, I got a call from A.D. Joy. This is Roberts.

309
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,420
请稍等一下，长官
Hold for just one moment, sir.

310
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,100
我是乔伊
Joy.

311
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,870
我是罗伯，你找我
Yeah, Roberts. You needed me.

312
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,580
你没找我？
You didn't cal

313
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,820
没有，你想干嘛？
No, Roberts. What do you want?

314
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,170
你应该让我替你买套西装
You should 've let me buy you a suit, Stanley.

315
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,870
我穿这样就很好，谢谢
I'm happv with what I'm wearing.

316
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,380
你太邋遢了
Ignorance is bliss.

317
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,880
想我吗？
Miss me?

318
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,050
史丹利，这是盖布洛
Stanley, Gabriel

319
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,920
史丹利老弟，好帅的夹克
Big Stan. Nice suit.

320
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,390
谢了
Thanks.

321
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,630
人家说佛要金装、人要衣装
Thev sav the clothes make the man.

322
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,960
你相信这一套？
You buy it?

323
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,090
不信，来杯酒？
Hope not. Drink?

324
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,070
我大老远跑来不是为了喝酒
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting. How about we get to the point?

325
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,900
不对，事实上…
No. Actually,

326
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,010
你大老远跑来是为了十万元，但那不是重点
you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand. But that's not the point.

327
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,510
希嘉，这是史丹利
Helga. Meet Stanley.

328
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,050
－你好，史丹利 －希嘉
- Hello, Stanley. - Helga.

329
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,490
盖布洛，我没什么耐性
Look, I don't have a lot of patience, Gabriel

330
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,320
也许你能帮我个忙
Maybe you can help me with something.

331
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,130
过来看看
Take a look at this.

332
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,870
你觉得怎样？限制进入

333
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,770
你知道我不能碰电脑
You know I can't touch that.

334
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,570
你喝龙舌兰酒吗？
Do you like tequila, Stanley?

335
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,050
搞什么
This is bullshit.

336
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,180
你对我有要求，我对你也一样
You want something from me, and I from you.

337
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,260
国防资料库，128位元密码
DOD d-base, 128-bit encryption.

338
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,260
怎么样？不可能吗？
What do you think? Impossible?

339
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,460
没有不可能的事
Nothing's impossible.

340
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,620
很好，你一定能破解
Good. Maybe slide

341
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,530
你要利用电脑虫侵入系统
in a Trojan horse hiding a worm?

342
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,190
也许吧，这是面试吗？
Is this an interview?

343
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,170
算是吧，马可
Sort of. Marco.

344
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,530
给他一点犒赏
Give him some incentive.

345
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,270
你在干嘛？
Hey, what are you doing?

346
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,740
放轻松
Relax, Stanley.

347
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,550
我听说世上最顶尖的骇客
I have been told that the best crackers in the world...

348
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,820
60分钟内就能破解
...can do this in 60 minutes.

349
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,890
不幸我要你在60秒内破解
Unfortunately, I need someone to do it in 60 seconds.

350
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,130
你在开玩笑
You're kidding.

351
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,330
不是，开始
Afraid not. Go.

352
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,460
快起来
Get up, get up!

353
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,110
55秒
Fifty-five.

354
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,510
快动手吧
Get on with it.

355
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,130
这算什么？
What the hell is this?

356
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,980
别浪费时间
Time's a-wasting, big guy.

357
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,450
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

358
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,550
45秒
Forty-five seconds.

359
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,360
拒绝进入

360
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,300
她很棒，对吧？
Oh, she's good, isn't she?

361
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,830
搞什么鬼？天啊
What's going on here? Jesus Christ.

362
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,870
拒绝进入

363
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,380
时间不够
More time, more time!

364
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,780
快点
Come on, Stan!

365
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,540
20秒…19秒…
Twenty. Nineteen.

366
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,390
15秒
Fifteen.

367
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,820
拒绝进入

368
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,530
快点
Come on.

369
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,600
10秒…9秒…
Ten. Nine.

370
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,200
拒绝进入

371
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,010
3秒…
Three.

372
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,080
2秒…
Two.

373
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,340
1秒…
One.

374
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,210
完了，你死了
Too bad. You gotta die.

375
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,510
不，等等
No, wait!

376
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,660
我只是耍你的
I was just fucking with you, Stan.

377
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,170
准许进入国防部资料库

378
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,940
就是他了
That's our guy.

379
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,170
离我远一点
Get away from me.

380
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,290
我真的很想帮你
I really want to help you, Stan.

381
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,210
你就是那样帮我吗？
Like you helped me in there?

382
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,440
－那只是个考验 －考验？
- That was a test, Stan. - A test.

383
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,140
你通过了
And you passed.

384
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,220
我太傻了，竟然会被你说服
I don't know why I let you talk me into this.

385
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,410
我以为你想救你女儿
You're saving your daughter.

386
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,890
我为了她什么都肯做
I'd do anything for her,

387
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,860
但是如果我死了一切都完了
but if I end up in a box or in jail... ...then I really can't help her.

388
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,260
我要拿了钱上法庭
I'm taking my money and going back to court!

389
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,090
你只有十万元
With your little $100,000?

390
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,640
你有钱，你前妻更有钱，动动脑筋吧
Melissa will throw $500,000 back at you. Think!

391
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,260
我被人拿枪指着叫我侵入…
I'm thinking that you'll put a gun to my head just to see if I can...

392
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,740
有人在，我尿不出来
I can't pee in front of an audience.

393
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,460
我再跟你说一遍
Let me break it down to you, Stanley, one last time.

394
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,720
你住在拖车屋
You live in a trailer.

395
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,460
你不但有前科，工作也没前途
You're a felon. You work a dead-end job.

396
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,660
你急着想把女儿要回来
And you desperately want your daughter back.

397
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,380
盖布洛是你唯一的机会
Gabriel is your only shot.

398
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
你要好好把握
Take it.

399
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,940
我担心咱们的新朋友
I'm concerned about our new friend.

400
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,350
别吃他的醋
Oh, now, don't be jealous.

401
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,490
他肯定不会好好完成任务
I don't see him dragging his sorrv arse over the finish line.

402
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,720
史丹利，我以为你跑了
Thought we lost you.

403
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,420
告诉我你要做什么
Tell me what the deal is.

404
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,300
我要在我家办一个小小的聚会
The deal is that we're having a little gathering at the house.

405
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,600
一起来，我就告诉你
Come and I'll explain it to you there.

406
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,540
各位
Gentlemen,

407
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,800
没有好消息就别说
if it's not good news, don't sav it.

408
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,710
你心中会燃起一丝希望的火花
Actually, we have a rav of hope in the darkness of your life.

409
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,550
我们到机场时这两个人也在
When we grabbed Torvalds at the airport, these two guys were there.

410
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,390
你看看
Check this out.

411
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,480
几个小时后他们又出现
Recognize those two same guys, a few hours later. And then...

412
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,730
你猜谁来了？
...guess who shows up.

413
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,960
史丹利贾森
Stanley Jobson.

414
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,900
电脑杂志96年年度风云人物
Wired magazine's 1996 Man of the Year.

415
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,470
当年他是骇客的精神领袖
A burnout now, but the hacker Zeitgeist then.

416
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,670
他是我逮到的
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.

417
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,610
你跑来洛杉矶干嘛？
Whv are you in L.A., Stan?

418
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,650
他前妻和女儿住在这儿
His ex-wife and daughter live in Malibu.

419
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,310
她继父是影片公司老板
The new husband owns Backdoor Films,

420
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,890
他专门拍色情片
a shady porn production house.

421
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,760
虽然是录影带，拍得还算不错
The production value's good, considering that they shoot on video.

422
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,020
有几部的女主角是他老婆
His wife is in some of the videos.

423
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,000
我知道，她是色情女星
I know. She's like an actress.

424
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,160
很好，说完了吗？
That's great. Are you done?

425
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,970
那女的是谁？
Who's the girl

426
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,440
我们还不知道
Actually, sir, we don't know vet.

427
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,840
她是个大美女
She's a serious piece of talent.

428
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,310
他一点也配不上她
Man, she's way out of his league.

429
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,480
查出她的身分
Find out who she is.

430
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,750
我要监视她前妻家
Sit on the ex-wife's house.

431
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,980
没问题
You got it.

432
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,860
史丹利，下来吧
Stanley, you want to get wet?

433
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,130
我没穿泳裤
I don't have a suit.

434
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,570
你不用穿
You don't need one.

435
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,800
来嘛
Come on, Stan.

436
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,900
待会吧
Later.

437
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,800
正点，喝一杯吧
Some view. Let's get a drink.

438
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,640
打开泳池灯光
Pool lights on.

439
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,930
你是怎么办到的？
So how did you do it?

440
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,000
－什么？ －破解密码
- Do what? - Break the code.

441
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,200
我从后门放进一个逻辑炸弹
I dropped a logic bomb through the trap door.

442
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,400
才怪，你没有时间
No, you didn't. You didn't have time.

443
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,070
你喝什么？
What'll you have?

444
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:49,940
威士忌
Scotch.

445
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,170
老实说吧，你一定有高招
You can do better than that.

446
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,170
我知道密码
I used a password sniffer.

447
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,640
你是怎么知道的？
How did you do it?

448
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,220
不晓得，我的脑海浮现密码
I don't know exactly. I see the code in my head.

449
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,840
我不会解释
I can't explain it.

450
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,020
我给你看一样东西
Let me show you something.

451
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,900
不错吧？
Pretty impressive, huh?

452
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,870
我要你放一只电脑虫
So, what we need from you is a worm.

453
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,410
超级电脑虫
A hydra, actually.

454
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,950
这种电脑虫能破解加密系统
A multiheaded worm to sniff out digital footprints across an encrvpted network.

455
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,580
什么样的加密系统？
What kind of cipher?

456
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,350
威能加密系统
A Vernam encryption.

457
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,260
它一旦启动，编码就自动销毁，它也是128位元加密系统
The Key code is destroved upon implementation. And it's a true 128-bit encryption.

458
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,660
其实是512位元
Well, actually, we're talking a 512-bit.

459
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,700
那就更不可能了
That's definitely not possible.

460
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,740
我给你一千万美元
What if I give you 10 million dollars?

461
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,800
这就能解决你的问题吧
That would cover all your problems. Yes?

462
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,380
你还是认为不可能？
Unless, of course, it's not possible.

463
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,240
你考虑看看
But you think about it.

464
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,450
它不会咬人的
It won't bite you. I promise.

465
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,600
这不只是多荧幕系统
This is not just a multi-screen system.

466
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,830
而且使用DS3超宽频连线
It has a DS-3 connection.

467
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,210
同时能进入七个不同的网路
We can access 7 different networks simultaneously.

468
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,980
你必须破解它的中央加密程式
It has a central encryption you have to crack...

469
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,540
才能进入它的系统，试试看
...to utilize the system.  Try it.

470
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,490
没被枪指着我还真不习惯
It'll be hard without a gun to my head.

471
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,890
也许我该拿枪指着你
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.

472
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,960
你不是盖布洛的女友吗？
I thought you were Gabriel's.

473
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,700
我跟你想像的不一样
I'm not what you think I am.

474
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
金姬
Ginger.

475
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,420
有头脑的女人也能让你兴奋
You surprised that a girl with an IO over 70 can give you a hard-on?

476
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,520
还是不可能吗？
So is it impossible?

477
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,350
没有不可能的事
Nothing's impossible.

478
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,620
很好，那就一言为定了
Good. So we have a deal

479
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,430
早安
Morning.

480
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,540
你该说午安吧
You mean afternoon?

481
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,710
我想借用你的车去一个地方
Can I borrow your car for something?

482
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,040
好啊
Sure.

483
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,450
－拿去 －谢谢你
- There you go. - Thank you.

484
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,150
如果你想去找荷莉
Hey, Stan, if you're going to see Holly...

485
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,420
你最好穿得体面一点
...I suggest you re-evaluate the way you look.

486
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,390
这只是个建议
Just a thought.

487
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,420
这只是个建议
Just a thought.

488
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,430
妈，快接电话
Come on, Mom, pick up.

489
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,600
荷莉，你妈又迟到了？
Mom late again?

490
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,140
她马上就来
She'll be here in a minute.

491
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,790
我要计程车行的电话号码
Hi. Can I have the phone number for Yellow Cab?

492
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,550
想搭车吗？
Need a lift?

493
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,760
爸
Daddy!

494
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,490
你怎么会在这儿？
Oh, what are you doing here?

495
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,120
我好想你
I missed you so much.

496
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,060
我也好想你，宝贝
Oh, I missed you too, baby.

497
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,460
我带了礼物
I brought you something.

498
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,110
天啊，好可爱哦
Oh, my gosh. It 's so cute.

499
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,050
被妈知道了，你就会被关进牢里
Oh, Dad. If Mom finds out, she'llhave you thrown in jail

500
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,550
没关系，你要回家吗？
It's okay, baby. You want a lift home?

501
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,450
当然了
Of course I do.

502
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,520
来吧
Come here.

503
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,380
好了
All right.

504
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,180
你好重
You are heavv.

505
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,560
好帅的车
Nice car.

506
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,720
谢了
Hey, thanks.

507
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,990
你妈的车吗？她在家？
Is that Mommy's car? Is she home?

508
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,890
那是继父的车
That's my stepdad's car.

509
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,300
听我说
So listen to me.

510
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,970
我有办法跟你团聚
I found a way for us to be together.

511
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,850
我不希望你出事
I don't want anything to happen to you.

512
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,080
不会有事的
Everything's going to be fine.

513
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,060
不会有问题的，相信我
Everything's going to be okay. Just trust me.

514
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,260
爸，我爱你
I love you, Daddy.

515
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,890
过来，我也爱你
I love you. Come here.

516
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,270
回家吧，再见
You go home. Okay? Bye.

517
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,600
－我好想你 －我也是，进去吧
- I miss you. - I miss you too. Go.

518
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,180
甜心
Oh, sweetheart.

519
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,910
这个
Hey.

520
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,160
过来
Come here.

521
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,790
好了，进去吧
It's okay. Go. Go.

522
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,390
快进去
Go.

523
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,550
你是什么人？
Who the hell are you?

524
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,450
一个朋友的朋友
A friend of a friend.

525
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,960
该死
Shit.

526
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,050
可恶
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

527
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,760
史丹利，站住
Hold it! Stanley!

528
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,310
去开车
Go!

529
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,010
可恶
Oh, fuck.

530
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,020
该死
Oh, fuck!

531
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,300
别动
Don't move!

532
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,940
别乱来
Don't move.

533
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,370
过来
Come here.

534
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,120
你看看
Look at this.

535
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,790
你为什么逃跑？
What were you running for?

536
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,790
你要逮捕我吗？
You arresting me?

537
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:39,020
因为你违反假释条例离开德州
For violating your parole bv leaving Texas without permission?

538
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,700
或是逃避联邦探员追捕
Or evading an officer

539
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,130
还差点害我没命？
and almost getting me killed in the process?!

540
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
不，我不会逮捕你
No, I'm not arresting you.

541
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,570
那么你想干嘛？
Then why are we talking?

542
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,340
你为什么来洛杉矶？
What are you doing in L.A.?

543
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,570
度假
Vacationing.

544
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,580
度假才怪
Vacationing, right.

545
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,150
法官准许你探望女儿吗？
The judge is allowing you to see your daughter?

546
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,980
去死吧
Fuck you.

547
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,110
你才去死吧
Fuck you? Oh?

548
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,350
你就是要嘴硬，是吧？
You just want to get right down to it?

549
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,650
好吧
Okay, fine.

550
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,720
我可以帮你要回女儿
I can help you with your daughter.

551
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,500
只要你肯帮我
You help me, I'll help you.

552
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:21,240
不好意思，事实上是…
You'llhave to forgive me. The fact that...

553
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,310
你把我关起来，我不太相信你
...you put me in jail doesn't inspire trust.

554
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,500
你侵入FBI的资料库
You put a virus in an FBI program

555
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:28,480
用病毒破坏整个系统
and set it back two years.

556
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,010
他们非法阅读国民的电子邮件
Thev were reading ISP subscribers' e-mail It was illegal

557
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,020
我只是伸张正义
I did what the judges wouldn't do!

558
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,550
你犯了法
You broke the law!

559
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,880
我们都尽了责任
We both did what we had to do.

560
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,890
但是那项计划还是照常进行
And your program is back in full swing.

561
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:46,030
我很想叙旧，但是你不逮我…
Nice trip down memorv lane, but if you aren't arresting me...

562
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,090
你就是不肯合作
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.

563
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,830
前几天我碰到你老友托沃
I ran into your friend Torvalds the other dav.

564
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,770
他也来度假
He was vacationing too.

565
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:06,110
两名顶尖骇客怎么都在洛城？
What are the odds of you being in L.A. At the same time?

566
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,410
我最爱迪士尼乐园
I'm just a sucker for Disnevland.

567
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,280
说完了吗？
We done?

568
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,650
很好
Good.

569
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,150
帮我跟托沃问好
Tell T orvalds I said hello.

570
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,220
他死了，你不小心也会没命
You can tellhim yourself if you're not careful He's dead.

571
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,260
给我一张名片
Give me a card.

572
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,770
想到什么就打给我
You think of anything to sav, call me.

573
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,630
抱歉打歪你鼻梁
Sorrv about your nose.

574
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,050
史丹利，你根本搞不清状况
You're in way over your head.

575
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,410
我知道
I know.

576
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,410
你要我监视他吗？
You want me to watch him?

577
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,890
好，去安排
Yeah, set it up.

578
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:17,440
今天我够倒霉了，现在更糟
I've had a shitty dav so far, but I think it just got worse.

579
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,950
你要开枪，还是要告诉我…
Either shoot me, or tell me...

580
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,660
你为何戴窃听器
...why you're wearing that wire.

581
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,530
办不到
Can't do that.

582
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,570
你到底是谁？
Who are you, Ginger?

583
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,700
我不能说
I can't tell you.

584
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,810
你是谁？
Who are you?

585
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,510
他知道了会杀死我
He'll kill me if he finds out.

586
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,170
那不是我的问题
That's not my problem, is it?

587
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,410
你不信任我怎么行？
You're asking for a lot of faith without giving me any.

588
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,760
你把我拖下水
You brought me into this mess.

589
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,340
我要知道你的身分
I deserve to know who's plaving me.

590
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,980
你是谁？
Who are you?

591
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,910
金姬

592
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,250
我是缉毒局干员
I'm DEA, Stanley.

593
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,910
老天爷
Holy shit.

594
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,050
我们要抓的是盖布洛
We're after Gabriel

595
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,790
把电脑虫给他，拿了钱就走吧
Give him the worm take the money  and get out of here. That's all

596
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,640
你们真是亲热
This looks friendly.

597
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,510
你知道我总是热情洋溢
You know me, I'm a friendly girl

598
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,750
来吧，史丹利，去喝杯咖啡
Come on, Stanley. Let's get coffee.

599
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,000
你听过剑鱼行动吗？
Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?

600
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,870
没有
No.

601
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,170
那么你一定会吓一跳
Then you'll appreciate the ironv.

602
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,900
浓缩意大利咖啡
Triple espresso.

603
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,810
－来两杯 －好
- Two. - Okay.

604
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,080
80年初缉毒局成立傀儡公司
In the '80s, the DEA set up a network of dummy corporations...

605
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,490
为了洗贩毒赃款及搜集证据
...as a front to launder drug money and gather evidence.

606
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,450
后来这些公司开始赚很多钱
But these companies started to make a lot of money.

607
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,330
1986年剑鱼行动结束时
In 1986, when it was terminated,

608
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,590
银行帐户共有四亿美元
$400 million was in these accounts.

609
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,100
这笔巨款消失无踪
Monev that just sort of disappeared.

610
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,900
它没消失，它一直在生利息
It didn't disappear. It sat, earning interest.

611
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,610
那是15年前的事
That's 15 years ago. You know

612
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,510
你知道现在有多少钱吗？
how much money that is todav?

613
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:08,280
95亿美元
Nine and a half billion.

614
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,250
这简直是暴利
This is a sweet deal

615
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,850
只要透过电话线通过防火墙
We go in over the phone lines,  pop the firewal...

616
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,080
丢进超级电脑虫
...drop in the hydra

617
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,850
就能轻松地偷走这笔巨款
and wait for the money.

618
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,990
你想得太容易了
Arert you getting ahead of yourself?

619
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,760
为了能进入伺服器
To access the cluster,

620
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,340
你要找有接驳网路主干线的银行
you need a bank on  the backbone of the network.

621
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,460
你知道有多难找吗？
You now how long that'll take to find?

622
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,870
没问题，往后看
Not a problem. Look behind you.

623
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,750
世界银行

624
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,320
干杯
Cheers.

625
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,300
他们看起来像社交名流
These fellows might wear Armani...

626
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,070
但是走起路来就知道是军人
...but they have the swagger of ex-militarv.

627
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:12,140
或是保镖，不过我看是佣兵
Maybe bodvguards, but they look like mercs to me.

628
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,080
这里面一定有鬼
Something's going on.

629
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,580
他们有两条DS3超宽频线路
Thev have two DS-3 trucks.  That's serious bandwidth.

630
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,780
感应器显示屋内散发强大热量
Thermal scopes show a huge heat load.

631
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:21,880
很可能是电脑主机
Could be mainframes.

632
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,820
房子登记在名人地产名下
The house was listed bv Celebrity Estates.

633
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,920
两星期前被一家公司承租
It was leased two weeks ago bv a blind corporation.

634
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,120
没有任何其它资料
No other info on them vet.

635
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,360
等一下
Wait a minute, Joe.

636
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,060
穿蓝色衬衫的家伙
Blue shirt, pinstripe.

637
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,370
就是他
Oh, veah, that's him.

638
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,740
他就是主谋
That's our man right there.

639
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,020
你正好来看史丹利找到电脑虫
Just in time to watch Stanley find our worm.

640
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,260
我念大学时写了一个密码程式
In college, I created the source code for the worm I use.

641
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:06,990
加州理工学院校友会

642
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,760
拒绝进入

643
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:14,160
那儿还有原始的资料处理器
In the basement is the only PDP-10 still active and on the Internet.

644
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,830
但是很少人知道
Not many people know it.

645
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,910
那架老旧的网路交易伺服器
It's an IT S machine,

646
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,010
还能上线作业
kept online for historical sake.

647
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,110
把电脑虫藏在那儿不会被发现
I hid my worm there, where no one would ever look.

648
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,080
使用者确认中

649
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,480
准许进入

650
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,820

参议员，出了状况
Senator, we have a problem.

656
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,890
参议员
Senator.

657
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,330
你惹上了大麻烦
Seems you're in a predicament.

658
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,990
是吗？我不懂

659
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,900
下载我寄的档案
Download your file.

660
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,040
参议员
Senator...

661
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,840
你知道是谁给我的吗？
You know where I got these?

662
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,210
联邦调查局副局长
From the deputy director of the FBI

663
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,120
他觉得我会有兴趣
He thought I might be interested.

664
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,780
请恕我直言
Sir, do you think...

665
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:12,120
你以为我无法掌控这项行动？
...there is any aspect of this  operation I am not aware of?

666
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,790
我要取消这项行动，放个假吧
We are aborting the operation. Take a vacation.

667
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,920
放假？我曾让你失望吗？
A vacation? Have I ever failed you, sir?

668
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,930
这不是重点
That's not really the point, is it?

669
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,900
这才是我的重点
It 's my point.

670
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,700
你忘了任务的目标
You're losing sight of our objective.

671
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,710
太危险了，我们要重新评估
The risks are too great.

672
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,370
用别的方法募集资金
We'll seek alternative means of finance.

673
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,340
这项行动继续进行
This operation is moving ahead.

674
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,080
一切都在我的掌控中
Everything is under control

675
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:52,960
小伙子
Son...

676
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,840
假如你养一只巨大的洛威拿犬
...let's just sav you've got a 200-pound Rottweiler.

677
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,580
它对你很忠心
Now, he loves you.

678
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,150
它的责任是保护你
It's his job to protect you.

679
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,110
但它咬你一口，你就得杀了它
But if he bites you, you got to put him down.

680
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,550
谁知道它会咬谁？你懂吗？
Can never tell who he might bite next. You understand?

681
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,120
我懂，参议员
Yes, I do understand, senator.

682
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,890
西岸的麦克锡堡有一组人马
I think we got a team on the West Coast. Fort MacArthur.

683
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,970
派他们去找盖布洛
Maybe they should pay our friend a visit.

684
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,610

太简单了
Too easy.

00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,610
不，别断线

百分之三
Three percent, please.

693
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,380
完了，我完了
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.

694
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,850
不…可恶
No, no, no. Fuck you!

695
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,520
该死，不会吧？
Shit, there's no fucking way.

696
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,520
我退步了
I'm rusty. Rusty.

697
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:40,400
好了，我要把你变成…
Okay. Time to disguise you...

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,850
电脑虫完成

708
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,490
你得改写密码
Now I've just got to modifv the code.

709
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:40,160
银行的IDS不能登录…
The bank's IDS logs everv packer...

710
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,760
22或80传输控制协定
...that go to any port other than the 22 or 80 TCP.

711
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,170
天啊
Holy shit.

712
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:51,470
爱德居酒庄1996年份白酒
White, white.

713
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,210
不是
Nope.

714
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,880
快点…快点…
Come on, come on.

715
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,520
找到了
Here we go.

716
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:12,430
1926、1996…
Twenty-six. Ninety-six. Nine...

717
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,830
可恶
Oh, shit!

718
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:27,140
怎么了？你好像见鬼了
What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.

719
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,150
我们得谈谈
We gotta talk.

720
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,880
－那就开车兜兜风 －何不在这儿谈？
- Let's take a drive. - Can't we talk here?

721
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:32,010
不行
We shouldn't.

722
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,620
你听过胡迪尼吗？
Ever heard of Harrv Houdini?

723
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,220
他不像现在的魔术师只会做秀
He wasrt like todav's magicians, only interested in television ratings.

724
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:42,960
他是艺术家
He was an artist.

725
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,220
他能在人群中让大象凭空消失
He could make an elephant disappear in a full theater.

726
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,930
他用什么方法？
You know how he did that?

727
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,460
障眼法
Misdirection.

728
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,630
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

729
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,230
障眼法
Misdirection.

730
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,210
只要亲眼目睹就会信以为真
What the eves see and the ears hear, the mind believes.

731
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,340
怎么回事？
What's going on?

732
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:00,740
有人跟踪，坐好了
We've got a tail,Hold on.

733
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,890
该死
Shit.

734
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,230
天啊
Jesus. Jesus!

735
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,600
我得想办法，你来开车
Take the wheel

736
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,600
什么？
What?

737
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:26,830
你来开车
Take the wheel

738
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,240
可恶
Holy shit!

739
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:47,290
他们是谁？
Who are those guys?

740
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,560
天啊
Jesus!

741
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,130
你在干什么？
What the fuck are you doing?

742
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,570
天啊
Jesus!

743
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,360
快开车
Drive, Stan.

744
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,190
快点
Move!

745
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,160
我不会开这辆车
I can't drive this thing.

746
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,390
快学呀
Learn!

747
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,900
快走
Move it.

748
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,390
快点！
Come on!

749
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,140
左转，左转
Hard left! Hard left!

750
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,150
继续开
Keep going!

751
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,690
冲过去
Go!

752
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,610
上车
Get in the car.

753
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,220
你先告诉我这是怎么回事
Not until you tell me what I'm involved in.

754
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,950
史丹利，我喜欢你
Look, Stanley, I like you.

755
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,680
也把你当朋友
You're on my good side.

756
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,780
但是别以为我会心软
But don't confuse  kindness with weakness.

757
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,000
你只剩12小时，快上车吧
You have 12 hours to get the hydra. So get in the car.

758
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,630
史丹利，你还好吧？
Stanley, are you okay?

759
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,970
我眼睁睁看那疯子大开杀戒
I just saw that maniac  murder people in the street.

760
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,410
我好得不得了
I'm fucking great.

761
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,110
你不能走，不会有事的
You can't leave. It 'll all work out.

762
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,270
相信我
You gotta trust me.

763
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,780
鬼才相信你
Trust you? Yeah.

764
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,980
你是缉毒局，联邦探员在盯我
You're DEA, I got the feds up my ass...

765
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,050
我也搞不清状况
...and I don't know what's going on here.

766
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,110
查不出他的老板就前功尽弃
If we don't find out who he works for, we'llhave to start over.

767
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:08,390
这不是我的问题，我才不在乎
That's not my problem. I don't care who he works for.

768
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,560
荷莉呢？你不在乎她吗？
What about Holly? Do you give a shit about her?

769
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:15,900
你只要完成任务就能要回女儿
Finish the job. We'll get your daughter back.

770
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,500
我保证
I promise.

771
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:22,310
班德，奥勒冈州

772
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,090
美好的原野风光
Ah, the great American outdoors.

773
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:17,100
我不晓得溪钓有什么好玩
Yet I never understood the appeal of fly -fishing.

774
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,860
泡在水里大半天却钓不到鱼
A bit too much like masturbation for me without the payoff.

775
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,600
这不是保育区吗？
This is a catch-and-release stream, isn't it?

776
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,440
对，应该是吧
Yeah, I believe it is.

777
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,940
这也未免太讽刺了，参议员
You must see the ironv in that, senator.

778
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,570
你身为打击犯罪委员会主席
Chairman of the subcommittee on crime...

779
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,980
却在保育区钓鱼
...fishing in a catch-and-release stream.

780
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,520
我尽心尽力，你怎能背叛我？
How could you do it to me, Jim? After all we suffered.

781
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,460
我换了太多身分都忘了我是谁
I've changed my identity so often I don't know who I am anymore.

782
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:49,060
就快成功了，你怎么能出卖我？
How could you do it? We were so close to our goal

783
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,760
FBI盯上你
The FBI was watching you.

784
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,960
你想杀死我
You tried to kill me.

785
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,600
你背叛了理想
You've misplaced your loyalty, senator.

786
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,380
也出卖了美国
You've sold out America.

787
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:11,610
伟大的爱国情操永远不死
Patriotism does not have a four-vear shelf life.

788
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,420
很可惜政客会死
But politicians do.

789
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,560
你想干什么？
What are you doing with that?

790
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,730
第三任总统杰佛逊
Thomas Jefferson

791
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,460
曾经射杀一名叛国贼
once shot a man for treason.

792
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,940
慢着，第三任总统…
Hold the phone. Thomas Jeff...

793
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,170
史丹利，你好吗？
Stan. How are you?

794
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,680
－很好 －完成了吗？
- Fine. - Finished?

795
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:21,810
你是史丹利贾森吗？
Is this Stanley Jobson,

796
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,480
身分证号码
social security number 669547311?

797
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:26,080
是的

798
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,160
这里是瑞士银行
I'm calling from Credit Suisse to notify you...

799
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:33,260
你的新户头刚汇入一千万美元
...that $ 10 million was transferred into your new account.

800
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,800
我答应你的
As promised.

801
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,890
谢了
Thanks.

802
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,800
没我的事了吧
So I'm done, then.

803
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,710
就快了，跟我来
Soon. Walk with me.

804
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,610
我要违背我的原则
Against my better judgment,

805
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,950
跟你说我是谁
I'm going to tell you who I am.

806
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,250
不用，我知道了
I know who you are.

807
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,550
是吗？
Do you?

808
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,320
你以为我是抢匪，但是…
I think you think I'm a bank robber.

809
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,420
其实我跟你一样
But the truth is, I'm just like you.

810
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:03,660
你跟我不一样，你是杀人魔
Like me? No. Because you're a murderer.

811
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,560
我是杀了人，但我有道德观念
That I am, and worse. But I do have ethics.

812
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:08,660
我也有原则
Rules I adhere to.

813
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,430
你为什么跟我说这些？
Whv are you telling me this?

814
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,630
你听完了就会懂
Well, if you listen, then you'll know.

815
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,570
你问我那些人是谁，我来告诉你
You asked who those men were. I'll tell you.

816
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,440
胡佛在50年代成立秘密组织
Hoover started a secret organization in the '50s,

817
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:21,950
名为“黑牢”
called Black Cel

818
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:24,710
宗旨是捍卫国家的自由
To protect our freedoms.

819
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,980
我不在乎，我只在乎我女儿
I don't care. All I care about is my daughter.

820
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,610
我说的就是你女儿
I'm talking about your daughter.

821
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,850
我说的是你、你女儿
You, your daughter...

822
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,590
以及两亿名自由的美国公民
...and 200 million Americans who take their freedoms for granted.

823
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,990
我了解了
I see.

824
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:40,090
你不了解捍卫自由的代价
You don't know what it takes to protect our freedoms. That's my job.

825
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:45,360
我的责任就是保护你的生活
To protect your way of life.

826
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,770
你跟你的狐群狗党
So you're really stealing all this money

827
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,900
是为了小老百姓才偷那笔钱的吗？
just to protect little old me.

828
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:55,010
没错史丹利，因为打仗需要钱
That's right, Stanley. Because wars cost money.

829
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,710
打仗？
War?

830
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,890
我们跟谁打仗？
Who are we at war with?

831
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:13,600
危害美国的每一个人
Anvone who impinges on America's freedom.

832
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,130
也就是恐怖份子
Terrorist states, Stanley.

833
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,310
我们必须以牙还牙
Someone must bring their war to them.

834
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:27,570
他们炸一座教堂，我们就炸十座
Thev bomb a church, we bomb 10.

835
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,840
他们劫机，我们就炸掉机场
Thev hijack a plane, we take out an airport.

836
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:32,380
他们处决美国游客
Thev execute American tourists,

837
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:34,680
我们就炸毁一座城市
we nuke an entire city.

838
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:37,120
我们要以暴制暴
We make terrorism so horrific...

839
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,620
这样他们才不敢攻击美国人
...that it's unthinkable  to attack Americans.

840
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,520
你不是透过网路偷钱
You're not using the phone lines.

841
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,600
你是抢银行
You're going into the bank.

842
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,630
你也要一起去
And you're coming with us.

843
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,600
24小时后就结束
It'll all be over in 24 hours.

844
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,860
你发财了，史丹利
You're a rich man, Stanley.

845
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:54,470
你很快就能跟女儿逍遥过一生
Soon you'll be on a vacht with your daughter, eating bonbons.

846
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,740
实现美国梦
The American dream.

847
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,300
你想想看
And just think:

848

你这算是对美国有小小的贡献
You'llhave done your small part in ensuring America's way of life.

849
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,140
你是个英雄
You're a hero, Stan.

850
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:13,360
没关系，让他走
Don't worry. Let him go.

851
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,290
他一定会回来
He'll be back.

852
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,560
好了，准备好，出发吧
Okay, load them up. Let's move out.

853
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,490
走吧
Let's go!

854
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,480
退后
Back!

855
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,080
天啊

856
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,890
快点…快点…
Move it, move it! Let's move!

857
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,790
照我的话，手放在头上
Let's go. Hands behind your head. Let's go!

858
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:28,560
钥匙给我
Key, please.

859
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,330
钥匙？我不知道你在说什么
What Key? I don't know about any Key.

860
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,800
钥匙

861
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,760

快走吧，快点
Let's go, let's go!

864
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,800
蹲下，所有人蹲下来
Down. Everyone down!

865
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,370
等我一下
Just wait here.

866
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,220
梅莉莎？
Melissa?

867
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,660
荷莉
Holly!

868
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:47,410
天啊
Oh, God.

869
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,140
荷莉
Holly!

870
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,250
荷莉

871
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,310
荷莉

872
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,450

874

可恶，荷莉
Shit!

875
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:14,160
联邦探员罗伯 不，放开人质
No! Release the hostage!

876
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,870
救救我
Help me!

877
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,440
不，放开她，放开她
Let her go! Let her go!

878
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:41,430
你没事吧？
You all right?

879
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,590
没事
I'm good.

880
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,960
这是你的错
That was your decision!

881
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:13,900
不，是你的错
No, you did that!

882
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,470
你还要害死多少人？
How many people die is up to you!

883
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:20,060
25分钟后把飞机开到机场
I want that plane on the runway in 25 minutes!

884
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:25,940
他要在25分钟后上飞机
He wants a plane on the runway in 25 minutes.

885
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,910
我建议你乖乖照办

886
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,450
他要飞机，我就给他飞机
He wants a plane? I'll give him a goddamn plane.

887
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,950
史丹利，把事情做完
Finish the job.

888
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,460
我要先见到女儿
Not until I see my daughter!

889
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,650
你要见她？带上来

天啊，宝贝，你没事吧？
Oh, Jesus. Baby, are you okay?

892
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,560
没事了
It's okay, it's okay.

893
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:54,200
你这坏蛋
You son of a bitch.

894
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:58,010
你以为我想这么做吗？
You think I wanted it to come to this?

895
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:02,140
我愿意牺牲人命捍卫国家
I'll sacrifice any lives I have to to protect this countrv.

896
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,910
包括我自己的命
Including my own.

897
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,090
放了她
Let her go.

898
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,990
我就把钱偷给你
And I'll get your money.

899
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,560
你只要完成任务就能走
You finish the job, and you both go.

900
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,000
快点吧，史丹利

你要转到哪个帐户？
How do you want it allocated?

904
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,560
平均分配到每个帐户
Spread evenly over the accounts.

905
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:56,100
总额95亿美元

906
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,800
好了，把女儿交给我
Come on. Done. Give me my daughter.

907
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:00,200
确认

908
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,470

把她带来

回头见

914
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,040
不会了
I doubt it.

915
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,540
怎么回事？怎么回事？
What's happening? What's happening?

916
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,140
钱不见了
The money's gone.

917
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,040
－拦住她 －快跑
- Stop her! - Go! Run!

918
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,410
抓住她

快走
Go!

920
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,150
她出来了
She's coming out.

921
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,950
过来，过来
Come here, come here!

922
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,230
怎么回事？
What happened, Stan?

923
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:05,130
爆炸破坏了电脑时钟
The explosion scrambled the internal clock.

924
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,710
才不是，你耍了我
No, it didn't. You fucked me.

925
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,210
你杀了我就拿不到钱
You kill me, you'll never get a dollar.

926
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,080
这笔钱每分钟会换一个帐户
The money jumps everv 60 seconds from one account to another.

927
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:21,950
接下来十年都是这样
It'll do so for the next 10 years.

928
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,120
本来不会发生，现在没办法了
It wasrt supposed to happen for another six hours, but hev.

929
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,650
快想办法
Fix it.

930
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,390
我束手无策了
Unfortunately, I can't.

931
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,520
帐户有1024位元加密系统
The accounts are encrvpted with a 1024-bit cipher.

932
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,900
连我也通不过它的防火墙
Even I can't get through the firewal

933
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,490
我跟你谈个条件
So here's the deal

934
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,130
放走人质我就告诉你怎么取款
Let the hostages go and I'll tell you how to get the money.

935
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,170
皆大欢喜，没人受伤
We all walk away. Nobodygets hurt.

936
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:45,470
怎么样？
Deal

937
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,440
我正在考虑
I'm thinking.

938
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,140
不行，把金姬带来
No deal Get Ginger.

939
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:55,420
让开
Move out.

940
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:58,990
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

941
01:16:59,090 --> 01:16:59,790
把她吊起来
String her up.

942
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,660
不，住手
No. Don't do this.

943
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,130
不，等等…
No! Wait, Wait!

944
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:04,750
不，等等
Wait, Wait!

945
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,460
别乱动，这会很痛快的
Hey, stav stil lt'll feel real good.

946
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,700
不，别这么做
No, don't do this!

947
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,230
等等

948
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,340
不知道她能活多久？
How long will she live? 60 seconds?

949
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:20,170
你疯了
You're insane!

950
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,610
最多60秒

951
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,650
－55秒 －好吧
- Fifty-five. - Okay, okay.

952
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,550
你最好在系统中留了后门
- Hope you built in a back door. - Come on, come on.

953
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:43,530
快点，快点
Come on, come on.

954
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:52,440
30秒
Thirty.

955
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,110
半小时后飞机会到机场
Plane's on the runway in a half -hour.

956
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,200
很好
Good.

957
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,280
20秒
Twenty.

958
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:05,250
她快死了
She's dving.

959
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,660
给我闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

960
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,190
10、9、8…
Ten. Nine. Eight.

961
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,460
我要帐号
Accounts, accounts.

962
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:22,600
转帐中

963
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:24,580

965
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:27,770
转帐完成

966
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,440
好了，放她下来
There it is. Get her down!

967
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:31,350
－检查 －确认
- Check. - Verified.

968
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:32,540
把她放下来
Bring her down.

969
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:51,640
她是缉毒干员
She was DEA, Stan.

970
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:52,800
把人质带走
Move them out!

971
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,610
走吧，动作快点
Let's move. Quickly and quietly.

974
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:20,100
谁也不想让悲剧重演
No one wants a repeat of this morning.

975
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:23,530
方圆五哩的领空要净空
Keep your distance. Clear the air space for five miles.

976
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,200
他们要走了
Thev're on the move.

977
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,100
快点
Move, move.

978
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:42,820
看什么？
What?

979
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,520
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

980
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,890
你在想…
You're thinking:

981
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,830
不知道这个坏蛋
If that launcher was a suppositorv...

982
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:58,390
会把那支火箭筒拿来干嘛？
...would that bad man stick it up my ass?

983
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:03,570
你敢再瞪我一眼
Well, you eveball me once more, bov...

984
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:08,610
我就把这支火箭筒塞进你屁眼
...I'll stick it so far up your ass... ...you'll be begging me for this bullet.

985
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,150
各位，你们要留在巴士上
This bus is your new holding area.

986
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,150
如果你们乖乖合作
If you don't test your collars,

987
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,380
事情很快就会结束
this will all be over soon.

988
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,900
快去逮这可恶家伙吧
Let's get this son of a bitch.

989
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:56,690
你怎么能心安理得？
How can you justifv all this?

990
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:59,260
你没有为大局着想
You're not looking at the big picture.

991
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:01,690
我问你
Here's a scenario:

992
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,890
要是你能治好所有的疾病
You can cure all diseases,

993
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,800
但是你得杀死一名无辜孩童
but the price is that  you must kill one innocent child.

994
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:08,900
你肯下手吗？
Could you do it?

995
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,600
不肯
No.

996
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:14,410
你让我失望，我是在作好事
You disappoint me. It's the greatest good.

997
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:16,270
如果需要杀十名孩童呢？
How about 10 innocents?

998
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,410
这就对了，就算杀一千个人
Now you get it. How about 100? 1000?

999
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,010
也是为了保护我们的生活
To preserve our way of life.

1000
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:25,580
你只要滥杀无辜就是恐怖份子
No man has the right to make that decision.You're just a terrorist.

1001
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,460
你错了，史丹利
You're wrong, Stanley.

1002
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,930
每天都有人白白送命
Thousands die everv dav for no reason.

1003
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,860
你怎么不可怜他们？
Where's your bleeding heart for them?

1004
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,400
难道捐钱给慈善机构就够了吗？
You give $20 to Greenpeace thinking you change the world.

1005
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,330
我会让恐怖份子吓得不敢造次
What countrv willharbor terrorists when they see the consequences?

1006
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:45,170
我可以花四千万元买一枚核弹
Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for 40 million?

1007
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,250
买半打甚至还有折扣
Hell, I buy half a dozen, I even get a discount.

1008
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,250
我们离机场还有20分钟车程
Advise Joy 20 minutes ETA at the airport.

1009
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,450
控制中心，转告分局长
Control, please let A.D. Joy know we're 20 minutes from the airport.

1010
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,890
我们20分钟后就到机场

1011
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,200
好了吗？
Ready?

1012
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,830
油加满了，可以起飞了
Bird's fueled, ready to go.

1013
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,130
机长呢？
What about your pilot?

1014
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,670
他来了
He's in the works now.

1015
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:16,800
很好，上吧
All right. Let's do it.

1016
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:20,440
这儿留一组人
Okay, I need a team over here.

1017
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,310
其他人到外面
The rest of you, let's go outside.

1018
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,530
该死
Fuck!

1019
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,600
天啊，他在搞什么鬼？
Jesus. What the fuck is he thinking?

1020
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,570
我以为你要去机场
Arert we going to the airport?

1021
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,680
这只是障眼法
Misdirection, Stan.

1022
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:10,490
你干嘛？你要去哪儿？
What are you doing? Where are you taking the thing?

1023
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,430
看过“横冲直撞大逃亡”吗？
You see Sugarland Express?

1024
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:13,830
你们在干嘛？

1025
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,290
我不喜欢它的结局
Didrt like the way it ended.

1026
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,600
快停下来
Pull over before you get...

1027
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,390
他们该不会想飞天遁地吧
Thev can't be serious.

1028
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:41,690
坐好了
Hold on!

1029
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:58,140
请注意，进行空中追捕
Attention control, this has now become an aerial pursuit.

1030
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,640
跑道上都是我的手下
I've also got people across the tarmac.

1031
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:06,080
长官，我刚收到讯息
Sir, I've just been informed

1032
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,750
巴士没有开往机场
that the bus is no  longer en route to LAX.

1033
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,580
怎么回事？
What happened?

1034
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:14,750
它冲破车队转到一街了
It broke through the vehicles and turned onto First Street.

1035
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,890
那就赶到一街
All right. Let's go.

1036
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,630
长官，巴士不在一街上
Sir, the bus is no longer on First Street.

1037
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,860
那它在哪里？
Then where is it?

1038
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,070
在空中
Airborne.

1039
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:54,960
他在做什么？
What's he doing?

1040
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:57,900
风速太强，他怕会撞到大楼
We have a strong wind condition.

1041
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,270
叫他爬升
Tellhim to climb!

1042
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,670
快爬升，快点
Climb, goddamn it! Climb!

1043
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,040
大家趴下来
Down! Everybodydown!

1044
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,780
一定要添加刺激的动作
Add action or excitement,

1045
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:16,750
要不然就得改变宣传策略
or change the direction  of the entire campaign.

1046
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,430
也许应该重新考虑
Maybe we ought to rethink the visual

1047
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:25,520
我的天啊
Holy shit.

1048
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:17,280
把大楼团团包围
Secure a perimeter around the building.

1049
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:20,370
蔬散大厅每一个人
I want evervbodyout of this lobbv right now.

1050
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,470
守住电梯和楼梯
Secure the elevators and stairs!

1051
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:24,050
拘捕出来的每个人
Anybody coming out, detain them!

1052
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:28,650
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1053
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,380
哪些电梯到屋顶？
The elevators to the roof?

1054
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:31,510
那里
Up there.

1055
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,780
货运电梯呢？
And the freight elevator?

1056
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:34,220
在后面
Rear of the building.

1057
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:35,390
那里
That way.

1058
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,240
史丹利老弟
Stan-man.

1059
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:58,010
好好照顾荷莉，后会有期
Take care of your girl Maybe I'll see you around.

1060
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,480
你逃不了的
No! It 's not going to end like this.

1061
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:03,280
实际一点，史丹利
Come on, Stan.

1062
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:05,410
你不能如愿以偿了
Not evervthing ends as you think it should.

1063
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,630
况且，观众都爱看快乐结局
Besides, audiences love happv endings.

1064
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:21,630
别乱动
Stay here!

1065
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,940
该死，快点
Shit! Come on.

1066
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:29,340
快走开
Move, move!

1067
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,980
不，史丹利
No, Stanley!

1068
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:41,220
快点
Come on.

1069
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,540
把他带走
Get him out of here.

1070
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:55,470
把武器拿走
Secure that weapon.

1071
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,730
走吧
Let's go.

1072
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,540
两位
Gentlemen.

1073
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:11,090
你们是来认尸吗？
You here to identifv the bodv?

1074
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:29,740
这具尸体的齿模显示他是…
The dentals match those the Israeli government sent us...

1075
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,370
前以色列情报员盖布洛史尔
...for an ex-Mossad agent named Gabriel Shear.

1076
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,680
对不起，长官
Excuse me, sir.

1077
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:42,980
缉毒局没有金姬诺亚的记录
The DEA has no record of any Ginger K nowles working for them.

1078
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:47,650
医院和殡仪馆也没有她的尸体
I checked all the hospitals and morgues, and I can't find her bodv.

1079
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:51,530
继续查，尸体不会凭空消失
Look again. Bodies just don't disappear.

1080
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,630
是的
Right.

1081
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:57,730
他能让大象在人群中凭空消失
He could make an elephant  disappear in a full theater.

1082
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,740
他用什么方法？
You know how he did that?

1083
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:01,130
障眼法
Misdirection.

1084
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:02,930
我是缉毒局干员
I'm DEA, Stanley.

1085
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:06,070
把电脑虫给他，拿了钱就走
Give him the worm, take the money and get out of here.

1086
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:09,950
只要亲眼目睹就会信以为真
What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes.

1087
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,720
障眼法
Misdirection, Stan.

1088
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:29,030
他是大坏蛋，史丹利
This is a bad guy.

1089
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:31,000
没有人会想念这个大坏蛋
Nobody's going to miss him.

1090
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,370
你还好吧？
You all right?

1091
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:35,270
我很好
Yeah, I'm good.

1092
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,970
你先走，去看你女儿吧
Whv don't you get out of here? Go see your daughter.

1093
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,380
好，谢了
Yeah, thanks.

1094
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:47,180
再联络
We'll be in touch.

1095
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:54,550
你这狡猾的家伙
You son of a bitch.

1096
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:03,030
谢谢你，吃饱了吗？
Thank you. You're done?

1097
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,300
吃饱了
Yes, I'm full.

1098
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,160
那就走吧
Good. Let's go.

1099
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:14,200
领航者，接下来去哪儿？
So, navigator, where's our next stop?

1100
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:15,840

1101
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,750
那儿有什么？
So what's in Holbrook?

1102
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:20,580
森林乐园，爸
The Petrified Forest, Dad.

1103
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:22,520

1104
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:26,290
你要走40号州际公路
I think you take the l-40 to the 180.

1105
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:27,550
没问题
Cool

1106
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:29,690
好了
All right.

1107
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,220
爸，你还好吧？
Are you okay, Dad?

1108
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:33,590
我很好，亲爱的
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

1109
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:45,780
放心啦，爸
Don't worry, Dad.

1110
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,410
我们一切都会很好的
It's going to be okay. We're going to be fine.

1111
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,810

你想转多少钱？

1118
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:35,150
全部，平均分配到这些帐户
