1
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,920
查理
Charlie!

2
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,730
我担心你赶不上这班巴士
I wasn't so sure you'd be on the bus.

3
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,550
不想让你的白人弟兄们误以为
Didn't want your white brothers thinking

4
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,100
你是我们族里最优秀的人才
you were the best we had.

5
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,180
所罗门群岛 1943年

6
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,060
小心
Watch out!

7
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,230
我的手
My hand!

8
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,720
他妈的
Goddamn!

9
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,360
快没子弹了，我们得快走
We're running out of ammo. We gotta get out of here.

10
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,630
前进
Move!

11
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,050
过来
Come on!

12
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,150
过来，你办得到的
Come on, you can do it! Come on!

13
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,650
完全没弹药了，恩得斯， 我们没弹药了
We got nothin', Enders! We're out of ammo!

14
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,180
乔伊，我们不该再平白牺牲，现在撤退还来得及
Joe... Nobody else needs to die. We can go! We can get outta here!

15
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,920
我们身负任务
We got orders!

16
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,590
上面要我们守住这个点，我们就得死守在这里
They told us to hold the position! And that's what we're gonna do!

17
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,660
起来，阿兵哥，死守下去
Get up, marine! Hold the goddamn position!

18
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,310
拼啦
Come on!

19
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,210
趴下
Get down!

20
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,660
汤米
Tommy.

21
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,720
该死的家伙
Goddamn you!

22
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,360
不
Oh, no! No!

23
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,710
- 比尔 - 我没子弹了
- Bill! - I'm out.

24
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,280
过来
Come on! Come on!

25
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,640
你他妈的，乔伊・恩得斯
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.

26
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,170
不
No... No!

27
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,910
不
No!

28
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,620
右手举起来
Raise your right hand.

29
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,320
- 我…说自己的名字… - 我，班亚吉…
- I... State your full name... - I, Ben Yahzee...

30
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,800
彭德尔顿营 加利福尼亚

31
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,640
兹誓言支持并保护美国宪法
..do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the US...

32
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,840
抵御任何敌人，不论国内或国外…
..against all enemies, foreign and domestic... ..against all enemies, foreign and domestic...

33
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,450
日本人称之为“箱子”，谁知道“坦克”的密码？
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me the code word for "tank"?

34
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,290
你们想成为密码战士
Come on. You boys wanna be codetalkers.

35
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,190
那就要有脑袋啊，快想
Show me some brains. Think!

36
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,760
我们怎么说坦克？
What do we call a tank?

37
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,530
Chay-da-gahi.

38
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,040
乌龟，很好
Tortoise. Good.

39
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,440
大炮，密码？
Artillery. Code word?

40
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,410
请说密码，白马二等兵
In code. Private Whitehorse.

41
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,180
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?

42
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,720
很好
Very good.

43
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,760
日本零式战机，密码？
Japanese Zero. Code word?

44
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,220
肯尼欧湾美国海军医院 1943

45
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,900
现在撤退还来得及
We can go! We can get outta here!

46
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,100
上面要我们守住这个点
They told us to hold the position!

47
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,920
天气真好啊
Nice day, huh?

48
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,320
乔伊？
Joe?

49
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,730
乔伊？
Joe.

50
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,710
你根本没听到我在说话，对吧？
Didn't hear a word, did you?

51
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,440
男人碰到美女不都是这样
That's what happens to a man when he's talking to a beautiful woman.

52
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,740
你不读我的唇语才会这样
It happens when you're not watching my lips, Joe.

53
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,060
你看我
Watch this.

54
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,000
你还没康复，骗不了人的
You're a mess, Joe. You're not fooling anybody.

55
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,510
不，丽塔，他才是还没康复
No, Rita. He's a mess.

56
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,540
我每天都在康复中
I'm getting better every day.

57
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,850
你中耳破损，平衡感不正常
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders. Your equilibrium's all screwy.

58
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,980
站都站不起来怎么重回战场
You can't go back to war if you can't stand up.

59
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,030
走吧，胜利不会从天上掉下来
Let's go, marines. This war ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.

60
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,490
乔伊？
Joe...

61
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,650
为什么你不好好留下来？
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?

62
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,220
总得有人留下来陪妇女救护团
Somebody's gotta keep the WAVES company.

63
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,930
你到底帮不帮我？
Are you gonna help me or not?

64
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,170
丧失听力

65
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,750
改善很多了
Marked improvement.

66
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,780
他左耳情况比较差吗？
And his left ear is the worse of the two?

67
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,950
好得真快
It's... amazing.

68
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,690
TBY型的范围比不上TBX
TBY hasn't got the range of the TBX.

69
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,360
所以讯号可能要分程传递
So you may need a relay to get your transmission to command post.

70
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,770
但重点是压力下的速度与精准
But what it really comes down to is speed and accuracy under pressure.

71
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,900
开始解读
Transcribe now.

72
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,800
维多，这是X光，完毕
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.

73
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,380
可恶，我方弟兄遭炮火攻击
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!

74
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,650
伤亡惨重
We're losing men.

75
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,980
请解读这段讯息
I need this message decrypted.

76
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,040
“请求炮火支援，目标在119，B15”
"Request fire support. We have target at one-one-niner, Baker one-five."

77
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,140
“碉堡有重机枪，请立刻开火”
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun. Fire at will."

78
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,570
初学者手气好
Beginner's luck.

79
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,640
换你了，大哥
You're up, mac.

80
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,380
- 恩得斯下士报到，长官 - 稍息
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir. - At ease.

81
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,720
你的表现相当不错，下士
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.

82
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,960
比从军前的行为好多了
Better than you did as a civilian.

83
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,330
偷窃撞毁机车，遭高中勒令退学
Stole a motorbike, crashed it. Got kicked out of high school.

84
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,870
袭击并殴打克里宾欧唐诺神父
Assault and battery... on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

85
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,530
连教士都打？
A priest?

86
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,380
他是齐纳主教高中副校长兼训导主任
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.

87
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,750
我以前念的是公立学校
Public-school boy myself.

88
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,520
训练中心时还是小错不断
Some minor problems in boot.

89
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,220
在上海获颁最佳勇气奖
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.

90
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,820
死守所罗门群岛表现杰出
And you made a hell of a stand on the Solomons.

91
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,990
那儿很苦吧？
Tough bit of business there, huh?

92
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,360
相当艰苦，长官
Pretty tough, sir.

93
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,740
可是，你想再回去？
But you're prepared to jump right back into it?

94
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,670
是的，长官，非常想
Yes, sir. Very much so.

95
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,100
非常想
Very much so.

96
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
可是…
Well...

97
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,380
我们的密码全遭日军破解
The Japs have pretty much busted every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.

98
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,510
你在所罗门群岛的弟兄，因密码被破解全部阵亡
You men on the Solomons were lost to a broken code.

99
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,220
在所罗门碰到过印地安人吗?
Tell me something. You ever run into any Indians on the Solomons?

100
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,350
- 印地安人，长官？ - 正确的说，应该是纳瓦荷人
- Indians, sir? - Navajo, to be exact.

101
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,100
军方用他们的语言，发展出一套新密码
The Corps has developed a new code based on their language.

102
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,140
评价相当不错
It's had quite an impact.

103
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,260
所以海军总部下令全力保护它
So much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it.

104
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,580
这就是找你来的原因
That's why you're here.

105
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,750
你将与密码战士配对，全力保护他们
You're to pair with one of them, keep his ass safe.

106
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,080
你负责保护他们的性命，以利他们执行密码任务
Your job is to keep him alive so he can do his job.

107
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,490
抱歉，我的专长是屠杀日军
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,

108
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,520
不是照顾印地安人
not baby-sitting some Indian.

109
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,460
我们不是随便挑到你的
Enders, we didn't pick your name out of a hat.

110
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,200
我们需要的是杰出陆战队员
We need good marines.

111
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,890
所以才选上你
That's why you're standing here.

112
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,800
你看
Take a look.

113
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,030
他就是个纳瓦荷人…应该死了
It's a Navajo. Or it was.

114
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,070
遭日军逼问密码，严刑拷打致死
Tortured to death by Japanese intelligence trying to bust our code.

115
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,610
所幸，他想说也说不出所以然
Fortunately, he couldn't help them even if he wanted to.

116
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,310
- 长官？ - 他是纳瓦荷人但不是密码战士
- Sir? - Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.

117
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,010
密码由他们的语言编成，但毕竟还是密码
Code's based on their language, but it is still a code.

118
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,090
东条巴不得活捉一个密码战士
Tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one.

119
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,290
我以下的话，绝不能泄漏出去
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal, cannot leave this room.

120
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,530
不管在任何情况下，密码战士绝不能落入敌人手中
Under no circumstances can you allow your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.

121
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,510
你的任务是保护密码
Your mission is to protect the code...

122
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,210
不惜任何代价
at all costs.

123
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,450
懂我的意思吗？
You understand me?

124
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,880
是的，长官，我懂
Yes, sir, I do.

125
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,650
很好
Good.

126
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,350
恭喜你，你刚获升中士
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.

127
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,910
手臂保持垂直
Keep those hands vertical.

128
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,910
不错，阿兵哥
Way to go, marine.

129
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,850
佛第诺，接替我一下
Fortino, take over.

130
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,950
少校办公室外的是你，对吧？
Hey... That was you, right, sitting in front of the major's office?

131
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,290
我叫彼得韩德森
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.

132
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,030
他们叫我公牛 不是因为我的肌肉
They call me Ox. Not cos of my big muscles or anything.

133
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,260
是因为我住在加州公牛城 好莱坞北边一点点
I'm from Oxnard, California. Just north of Hollywood a ways.

134
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
你也是两栖作战通讯连的人?
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

135
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,670
请问两栖通讯二分队怎么走?
Hey, know where we might find 2nd Joint Assault Signal?

136
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,080
请问两栖通讯二分队怎么走?
Hey, know where we might find 2nd Joint Assault Signal?

137
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,380
没听说过,老土
No fuckin' idea, mac.

138
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,520
多谢
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

139
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,590
从没看过那么多白人
I've never seen so many white men.

140
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,060
他们也没看过那么多纳瓦荷人
They've never seen so many Navajo.

141
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,600
看起来你上过战场
Looks to me like you got to see a little action there.

142
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,340
我也是
Me too.

143
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,740
屁股挨了日本鬼子的子弹
Jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass.

144
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,970
相不相信? 并不是我想逃避上前线
You believe that shit? I wasn't running or nothin'.

145
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,990
你在两栖通讯的任务 跟这些纳瓦荷通信兵有关吗?
So, your duty with JASCO have anything to do with these Navajo radiomen?

146
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,550
我奉命守密
I'm not at liberty to say.

147
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,260
我发现你升官了,我也是
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.

148
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,800
我猜,你不能说的秘密 跟我不能说的是一样
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell me are the same orders I can't tell you.

149
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,570
了不起的任务吧?
Hell of a thing, huh?

150
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,300
身不由己,中士,这里是军队
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant. It's the marines.

151
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,140
他们看起来蛮正常的
They look pretty normal, I guess.

152
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,620
难道他们得喷上迷彩?
Expecting them to wear war paint?

153
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,860
或许该过去打个招呼 他们好像迷路了
Maybe we ought to go introduce ourselves. They look a little lost to me.

154
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,620
韩德森
Henderson.

155
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,400
我不想跟他们太亲近
I wouldn't get too friendly.

156
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,210
怎么样?
How!

157
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,440
开个玩笑,我叫公牛
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.

158
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,240
我叫白马
Whitehorse.

159
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,250
他姓亚吉,叫班
This is Yahzee. Ben.

160
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,390
-下一位 -漂亮
- Next. - Beautiful. Beautiful.

161
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,750
闭着眼睛会比较好吃 下一个是谁?
Close your eyes. It'll taste better. Who's next?

162
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,860
可以一起吃吗?
Mind if I join you?

163
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,400
我叫班亚吉,跟你同一组
I'm Ben Yahzee. Guess the Corps paired us up.

164
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,030
你好吗?
How you doin'?

165
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,900
你挡住我的视线了
You're blocking my view.

166
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,080
对不起
Oh, sorry.

167
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,850
这难吃的东西是什么?
What do they call this crap anyway?

168
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,990
军方称之为食物
Marines call it chow.

169
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,550
有广告不实的嫌疑哦
Well, there's a propaganda effort.

170
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,970
对不起,我的赔你
Sorry. You can have mine.

171
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,600
啊,糟糕
Shit.

172
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,920
你说你叫什么名字,二兵?
What'd you say your name was again, Private?

173
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,250
我叫班亚吉
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.

174
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,650
端着
Hold this.

175
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,140
可恶
Shit.

176
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,250
你的白人搭档怎么样？
How's your white man?

177
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,680
饥饿
Hungry.

178
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,820
我再玩几把
I'm in for a couple more.

179
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,570
写信给你儿子？
You writing to your son?

180
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,640
帮我问个好
Tell him I say hello.

181

有人胆子不小
- Oh, come on! - Now there's a bold move.

185
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,020
好啦

186
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,620
佛州小子陷入两难
OK... Oh, another mess for the Sunshine State.

我们都是一手烂牌
We all got thumbs up our asses.

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,510
玩不久了,我朋友在军机处 他说我们下周开拔
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy in Intel that says we ship out in a week.

194
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,580
“下周”已经说一个月了

195
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,580
我不知道你有朋友在军机处
I didn't know you knew anybody in Intelligence, Harri.

196
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,590
拖到明年我也无所谓
Next year'd be all right with me.

197
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,180
各位,哭吧,9带4

算我一份
Cut me in.

210
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,550
我想玩大小通吃 最大最小都赢,A可以当两头
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low, hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

211
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,350
我想玩大小通吃 最大最小都赢,A可以当两头
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low, hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

212
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,220
别被他唬住
Hey, don't let him scare you.

213
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,420
反正就是大小通吃 了不起浪费时间跟金钱
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's like any other. Waste of time and money.

214
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,590
出底钱,酋长
Well, ante up... Chief.

215
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,330
你怎么知道我是酋长?

216
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,670
你一定看过我戴着战帽洗澡

目的地：塞班岛

223
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,870
它是我们通往东京的跳板
which is one of the stepping stones we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.

224
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,600
攻下这个岛极具战略价值

那么东京就在轰炸航程内了
and get our bombers within range of Tokyo.

228

目前塞班岛是日本的领土 上面驻守有三万日军
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil, and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.

229
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,660
他们必然会死守到底
They're gonna fight for every square inch,

230
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,390
因为那是他们的家 但我们要把它抢过来!

236
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,220
任务跟四个月来的训练一样 没问题吧?
exactly what we've been training to do for the last four months. All right?

237
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,400
司令部派来了几位通信兵

242
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,450
将掩护我们的纳瓦荷战士

243
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,300
你他妈的,乔伊恩得斯!
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

244
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:01,190
现在轮到我们赴汤蹈火了
..but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin' into our share of the shit nonetheless.

245
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,790
有问题吗?
Any questions?

246
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,810
听起来你好像快挂了
Sounds like you're dying.

247
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,650
这可以帮你消除气味
These might help get rid of the taste.

248
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,120
查理和我从圣地牙哥坐船来时 也吐得死去活来
Charlie and I, we both lost it on the boat ride from San Diego.

249
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,030
亚历桑那有水的地方并不多
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.

250
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,720
口气清香糖还蛮有用的

251
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,200
要不要来一个?
You want a Life Saver?

252
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,830
你为什么来这里?
What are you doin' here?

253
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,540
想帮个小忙罢了
Just trying to help.

254
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,280
我不是这个意思
Not what I meant.

255
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,980
你是说,我为什么从军?
You mean what am I doing in this uniform?

256
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,020
战争也跟我有关啊,中士

257
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,720
为我的国家、土地、同胞而战
I'm fighting for my country, for my land, for my people.

258
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,500
我担心的倒不是你的同胞
Not your people I'm worried about.

259
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,930
恩得斯,我是个密码战士

She walks straight up to me and asks me if I'm hungry...

383
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,720
因为她只吃条小热狗

万一我出了事
If anything should happen to me,

398
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:57,680
这个请交给我太太

399
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,790
这是她亲手挑的

400
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,230
不要说这种话,奈尔

连玩笑都不要开

戴回去,你会平安回家
Now you put that ring back on. You're goin' home.

00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,460
喝过才谢我还不迟
Don't thank me till you've tried it.

408
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,190
听起来像是祈祷
Sounds like some kind of prayer.

409
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,790
或许他们知道我们的命令
Maybe they know our orders.

410
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,480
你下得了手吗,乔伊?
Think you could do it, Joe?

411
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,640
不要一直想这问题,韩德森
Give it a rest, Henderson.

412
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,480
不要想?我试过,可是…
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...

413
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,050
该杀的是日本人,不是自己人
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.

414
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,170
你是个勇士，亚吉
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...

415
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,690
你是家族的荣耀
You will make your family proud.

416
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,750
你在干嘛,老弟?
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

417
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,090
正要穿上制服
Getting on my uniform.

418
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,860
知道你跟日本人 有什么差别吗?
You know the difference between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

419
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,600
差在制服
It's that uniform.

420
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,200
仅此而已
That's it.

421
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,600
我了解你们这些人
See, I know you people.

422
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,640
我清楚你们这些凤眼野蛮人
I know what kind of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.

423
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,710
落单时当心一点
You ought to be careful out here all alone.

424
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,450
没有人照顾你时
No baby-sitter.

425
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,950
我可能会把你看成日本鬼子
I might just take you for a Jap.

426
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,390
你要让我穿衣服吗,奇克?
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

427
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,620
还是继续演无知的白痴?
Or keep demonstrating what an ignorant fool you are?

428
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,000
无知的白痴是吧?
How's that for an ignorant fool?

429
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,840
拿啊,你试试看
Go ahead, try again.

430
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,590
你不是想干什么吗?
You gonna do somethin'?

431
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,790
奇克,住手
Chick! Come on!

432
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,830
走开!
Get off me!

433
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,970
-你没事吧,班? -没事
- You OK, Ben? - Yeah.

434
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,380
班?恶心
Ben? Shit.

435
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,620
我以为他是日本人 杀我弟兄,偷穿制服
I thought he was a Jap. You know, killed some marine for that uniform.

436
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,260
再扯嘛,奇克
Sure you did, Chick.

437
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,460
死红番不像日本鬼子吗?
Damn Injun looks just like a Jap, don't he?

438
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,500
我不是死红番
Look, I'm no damn Injun.

439
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:48,100
我是纳瓦荷人 母系是苦水族,父系是塔楼族
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.

440
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,870
但长相蛮像日本人
But you do look like a Nip.

441
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:58,920
下次要洗澡先通知我 否则我踢你屁股
Next time you decide to take a bath, Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.

442
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,790
妈的败类
Fuckin' shitbird.

443
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,590
他随时都需要人照顾
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter all the time, I thought.

444
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,590
连出去打鱼时也一样
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.

445
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:17,390
昨晚你看到的是 我们的庇护仪式
That ceremony you saw last night? It's called a protection ceremony.

446
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:24,330
纳瓦荷人相信尸体未安葬前 灵魂会一直待在附近
Navajo believe, untila body's given a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.

447
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:29,280
我们称恶灵为仙邸司
Chindis - that's what we call evilspirits. Demons.

448
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,020
我从小不曾认真想过这问题
I haven't thought much about it since I was a kid.

449
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,520
直到我目睹这些死尸
Till I saw those dead bodies.

450
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,150
你是说你看得到鬼魂?
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

451
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,620
不,我是说我不再害怕了
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you I won't freeze up again.

452
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:46,100
因为你朋友在你额头上抹灰?
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?

453
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,460
没错,因为我朋友 在我额头上抹灰
That's right. Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead.

454
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,300
你看过鬼吗?
You ever see ghosts?

455
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,980
不要再问傻问题了 这是命令
No more stupid questions today, Private. That's an order.

456
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,590
真好听
Sounds beautiful.

457
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,290
无师自通吗?
You, uh, you self-taught?

458
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,220
我爸爸常吹
My dad was always playing.

459
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:52,360
他们不是说“拼不过他就…”
You know what they say: if you can't beat 'em...

460
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,700
正确,这是我爸送我的
No shit. My dad, he... he gave me this thing.

461
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,530
他以前叫我小猪魔笛
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.

462
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,510
我一吹它们就过来吃饲料
Used to bring 'em in for feeding with this little tune I played.

463
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,710
我知道你不会停止吹笛子
I know I ain't gonna get you to quit playin' that thing, so...

464
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,410
所以“拼不过他就…”
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...

465
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,780
我觉得声音不协调
I don't think it's gonna work.

466
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:19,450
反正别无他法,管他的
Well, we ain't got much else to do out here. What the hell?

467
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,290
好吧
OK.

468
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,830
你起音,我来和
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.

469
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,890
第二侦查队0600出发
2nd Recon Company will move out at 0600

470
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,560
沿四号路搜索下去
and scout along road 04.

471
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:11,270
椰林西北边可能遭到轻微抵抗
You can expect light resistance northwest of the palm grove. Over.

472
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,440
收到，何谓“轻微”？ 没有任何抵抗是轻微的，完毕
Roger. What do you mean, light? No resistance is light! Over.

473
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,380
记住座右铭不问为什么
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to question why,

474
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,610
只管拼命与牺牲
ours is but to do or die."

475
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,340
“永远忠诚”完毕
Semper Fi. Over.

476
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,000
亲爱的乔伊,你到底怎么了?
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

477
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,530
因为你不爱写信 就应该音讯全无吗?
Or, given that you're not much of a writer, should I not expect an answer?

478
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:45,540
报上说,我军战果辉煌
The newspapers say our boys are doing great.

479
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,110
但我想记者都没看到 肯尼欧湾医院的伤兵
But I don't think the reporters have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.

480
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,280
前几天在瓦基基捡到只流浪狗
I found a stray dog the other day on Waikiki.

481
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,080
带回家洗个澡留下来养
I gave him a bath and took him in.

482
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,680
它令我想起你,但它比较可爱
He reminded me of you - but cuter.

483
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,190
至少它晚上给我温暖
At least he keeps me warm at night.

484
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:11,030
我尽量不想你 也不去想可能发生的事
I try not to think about you. About what might be happening over there.

485
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,030
但是,有时候躺在床上
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,

486
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,470
忍不住担心你的处境
I can't keep myself from wondering where you are.

487
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,540
和过得好不好
How you're doing.

488
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,020
你在干嘛?
What the hell you doin'?

489
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,090
写信给我儿子
Writing a letter to my son.

490
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,720
你忘了命令?不准流出一个字
Forget your orders? No letters out.

491
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,590
上面不准邮件进入保育区
Command don't want postmarks going to the reservation.

492
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,200
没听到吗?
Hey! You hear me?

493
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,180
我回家后他就看得到啦
I thought that he might read 'em when I get home.

494
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,980
他叫什么名字?
What's his name?

495
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,990
你儿子
Your son.

496
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,520
乔治,乔治华盛顿
It's George. George Washington.

497
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,160
乔治华盛顿亚吉
George Washington Yahzee.

498
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,460
听起来蛮响亮的
It's got a bit of a ring to it.

499
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,900
我太太不太喜欢
My wife wasn't so sure.

500
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,840
她比较传统
She's a little more traditional.

501
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,110
-好漂亮的一家人 -给我看看,亚吉
- Nice-looking family. - Let's see, Yahz.

502
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:34,840
乔治很有个性 他有自己的想法
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character. He's got a mind of his own.

503
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,480
我可以抽一根吗?
Can I try one of those?

504
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,190
-你抽烟? -抽着玩的
- You smoke? - Not really.

505
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,500
-下来! -快下车!
- Dismount! - Get out of the truck!

506
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,610
动作快!
Let's go! Let's go!

507
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:31,170
-跟我来! -走!
- Follow me! - Let's go!

508
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,550
我中弹了!
- I'm hit! - Yahzee!

509
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,210
亚吉
Yahzee!

510
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,250
我中弹了!
I'm hit!

511
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,590
拿下来!好烫!
Take it off! It burns!

512
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,570
你没中弹,闭嘴!
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit.

513
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,950
-散开! -动作快!
- Spread out! - Move!

514
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:29,490
-炸弹从哪来的? -我们自己人
- Where the hell are they comin' from? - From us.

515
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,770
-什么? -那不是日本人的炮
- What? - They're not Jap guns.

516
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:37,370
-自己人炸自己人? -我们应该走四号路
- We're getting shot at by our own guys? - We're supposed to be on road 04.

517
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,310
-通知团部 -没办法!
- Get the regiment on the horn. - I can't!

518
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,780
-告诉他们炸到自己人 -不行!无线电炸坏了
- Tell 'em they're shelling... - I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.

519
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,550
-他们炸太近了 -日本鬼子一定在我们前面
- They're firing too short! - The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.

520
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,210
想点办法
Do somethin'.

521
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,760
跟我来
Shit... Follow me!

522
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,590
-我们走错路了 -干!
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road! - Goddamn it!

523
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,180
完蛋了!
God.

524
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,570
龟孙子
Son of a bitch!

525
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,420
不要怕,老哥!
I got you, mac!

526
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,200
救护兵!
Corpsman!

527
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,670
救护兵!
Corpsman!

528
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,140
救护兵!
Corpsman!

529
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,690
奈里!
Nellie!

530
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,420
救护兵!
Corpsman!

531
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,080
你说的没错,乔伊
You were right, Joe.

532
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,590
我长得像日本人
I do look like a Nip.

533
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,750
你在说什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

534
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,260
穿上他们的制服
Putting on that Jap uniform.

535
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,260
用他们的无线电 通知我方停火
Trying to get one of their radios, call off our guns.

536
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,100
-笨主意 -闭嘴,让他说完
- That's stupid. - Shut up. Let him talk.

537
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,300
-他不能出去 -这里不由你指挥,恩得斯
- He's not goin' out there. - You're not in charge here, Enders.

538
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,930
我身负命令,枪头 我要保护他
I got orders, Gunny. He's my responsibility!

539
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:32,350
他还年轻啊! 你们在杀自己人!
He's just a kid! You killed your own!

540

I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have done it without Private Ben Yahzee.

我妈说,人家花时间写信
My mom says somebody takes the time to write a letter,

591

592
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,420
你妈肯让你喝酒吗?
Does she let you drink, your mother?

593
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,650
不肯,但她又不在这

被我扔到海里去
I threw it into the ocean.

608
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:27,980
那次是为了什么事?
What'd you get that one for?

609
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,810
因为我撑着没死
For not dyin'.

610

611

中尉前一晚就战死了

613
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:53,000
士官们也全死在登陆艇里
none of the sergeants even made it out of the landing craft, so...

614
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,630
所以只好由我指挥 我第一次发号施令
that left me in charge. It was my first command.

615
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:07,280

Orders were to hold some shitty swamp marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.

616
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:12,820
我只好听命行事
And I did.

617
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:19,160
我手下的弟兄
All of the men under my command...

618

信任我的人
men who trusted me...

619
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:35,110
全都求我撤退
who begged me to pull back...

620
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,750
结果没有一个生还
not one of them made it.

621
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:48,620
除了一个固执的浑球

622
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,870
他们因此给我银星勋章
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.

623
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:03,060
他们叫什么名字?

624
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:06,900
说他们的故事
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.

625
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:10,310
最好也知道他们的名字和长相
You know, who they were and what they were like.

626
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:18,050
纳瓦荷人鸟规矩真多 要干什么?

630
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,960

01:25:57,690 --> 01:26:02,360
值班12小时后 累得只有精力写信
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired to do anything but write letters.

676
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:10,230
真正感觉到战况不错 战争随时都有可能结束了
There is a real sense that the war is going well, and could be over soon.

677
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:17,240
越来越想你 你到底是死是活呢?
I think about you more and more. If you're alive or dead out there.

678
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:22,710
我每天查信 心想迟早会有答案
I check the mailevery day, knowing there's going to be an answer.

679
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:25,180
你有收到我的信吗,乔伊?
Are you reading these, Joe?

680
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,660
听到我的话吗?
Are you listening?

681
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,760
-左翼没有危险 -这区没有危险
- We're secure on the left side. - Area's secured.

682
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:38,030
做好防御工事
Set up defense positions.

683
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:40,330
奇克,负责扎营
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.

684
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:42,200
哈利
Harri.

685
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,060
怎么回事？
What's wrong?

686
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,550
好痛
I'm hurting.

687
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,170
这里有些止痛药
Here's some pain reliever.

688
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:05,920
别担心，你没事
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

689
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:12,790
谢谢，大叔
Thank you, Uncle.

690
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:35,410
听起来蛮有感觉的
That's startin' to sound like something.

691
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:25,990
不晓得你是个艺术家
I didn't know you were an artist.

692
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,230
随便涂鸦
Oh, it's stupid.

693
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:33,670
小时候常在祖母厨房桌上画
It's just something I would do as a kid on my grandmother's kitchen table.

694
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:36,110
很不错
Well, it's nice.

695
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:38,180
你信天主教?
You Catholic?

696
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,680
以前啦
I used to be.

697
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,310
正好想起受坚信礼的事
I was thinkin' about when they confirmed me.

698
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:50,820
八岁那年,他们帮我抹圣水
I was eight, and they anointed me with the holy water.

699
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,050
我还记得
And I remember...

700
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,820
他们说我是基督的战士
they told me I was a soldier of Christ.

701
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:05,440
不晓得什么时候迷失了自己
I guess somewhere along the way I must have switched units.

702
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:09,680
是油
It's oil.

703
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:14,950
坚信礼不用水,是用油
They don't use holy water to confirm. They use oil.

704
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,940
我家也信天主教
I was raised Catholic too.

705
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,950
上保育区内的教会学校
Mission school on the reservation.

706
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:26,190
神父作弥撒时 不喜欢我们说纳瓦荷语
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us talking Navajo at Mass.

707
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,160
有个礼拜天我忘记了
Of course, one Sunday I forgot.

708
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:35,690
被处罚绑在地下室的暖炉上
They punished me by tying me to the radiator in the basement.

709
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,770
整整两天
For two days.

710
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:41,070
记得我当时也是八岁
I think I was eight too.

711
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,470
现在可以自由说纳瓦荷语了
Well, they're sure lettin' you talk Navajo now. Yeah.

712
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:58,220
战争结束后 或许你该来看看纳瓦荷村
You know, when this is over, maybe you should come out to Navajo country.

713
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,930
纪念碑河谷很美,很幽静
Monument Valley is a beautiful place. It's peaceful.

714
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:06,830
可以尝试军队里没有的东西
You know, we could do some things that you don't do in the Corps.

715
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:12,460
比如骑马,吃炸面包,打猎
Like ride horses, eat fry bread, do some hunting...

716
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:17,250
骑马
Horses.

717
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:25,850
再说啦 到亚历桑那有好长一段路
I don't know. It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.

718
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:29,650
很值得,你可以看看我儿子
But it might be worth it. You know, you could meet my son.

719
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:32,820
他也可以见见乔伊恩得斯
And he could meet Joe Enders,

720
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,170
保护他瘦弱老爸的恩人
the guy who watched over Daddy's scrawny ass.

721
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:45,210
你一定是个好父亲,班
You must be a very good father, Ben.

722
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:51,070
班?你以前不曾这样叫我
Ben. You know, you've never called me that before.

723
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:56,570
恩得斯是哪一国名字?
Enders. What kind of name is that anyway?

724
01:31:57,290 --> 01:32:02,720
意大利,原本叫恩卓菲尼 被艾利斯岛移民局简化了
It's Italian. Used to be Endrolfini before some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it.

725
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:08,160
上尉要发一封密码信到司令部
Captain needs to code a message back to command post.

726
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,790
你就是那个印地安人?
You the Indian?

727
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:12,160
是的,我是那个印地安人
Yeah, I'm the Indian.

728
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,630
只要几分钟,马上送你回来
It's just a few minutes' drive. We'll get you back in no time.

729
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,990
-我有话跟你说,枪头 -等我一下
- I need to speak with you, Gunny. - Yeah. Give me a second.

730
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:49,370
今天寄来的,吃过腌鲱鱼吗?
Got this with the mailtoday. You ever had pickled herring?

731
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:53,680
我想调职
I need out.

732
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,770
你在说什么?
What the hell are you talkin' about?

733
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,850
目前的职务
This detail.

734
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,310
我的任务
My duty.

735
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,380
我无法执行
I can't do it.

736
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,180
我需要你,恩得斯
Well, I need you, Enders.

737
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,980
你救过很多同胞的命
Yeah. You've been saving a lot of marines.

738
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:17,630
我要向营部司令申诉 我要调职
I'm requesting mast with battalion commander. I want out.

739
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:24,000
是吗?大家都是妈妈的儿子 谁不想调职
Oh, yeah? You and me and every other mother's son. We all want out.

740
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:28,540
只要东条英机和希特勒不死
Well, as long as there's a Tojo and a Hitler out there

741
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,700
我们就得继续战,懂吗?
we have to keep on fighting. Is that understood?

742
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:36,410
-你误会了 -我听得一清二楚
- You're not hearing me. - I'm hearing you just fine.

743
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,810
现在全世界都在打仗
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide,

744
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,720
没空理会你的需求和愿望
and it ain't bein' waged on your wants and wishes.

745
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,450
好好去睡一觉,这是命令
Now you get some sack time. That's an order.

746
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,790
去你的!我下不了手!
Goddamn it! I can't do it!

747
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,730
我无法执行任务!
I can't perform my duty!

748
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:09,260
嘿,小朋友
Hey there, sweetheart.

749
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,430
嗨,没有关系
Hi. It's OK.

750
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:15,240
不要哭,不会有事
You don't have to cry. You're gonna be all right.

751
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:19,970
我送你一个礼物
Got a present for you.

752
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,470
巧克力
This is chocolate.

753
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,980
吃吃看,很好吃
You see, you eat it... and it's good.

754
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:35,790
很好吃
It's good.

755
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,420
要不要尝尝看?
You want some?

756
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,600
下次记得先嚼一嚼
You'll have to chew it next time. Here.

退回来!
Fall back!

766
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,220
求救!求救!
Help! Help!

767
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:45,540
不能让他们活捉我们
I can't let 'em take us.

768
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:50,840
说什么呀?
What are you talking about?

769
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:43,530
留他活口
Don't kill him.

770
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:44,900
他很重要
He's important.

771
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:48,210
我们需要拷问他
We need to interrogate him.

772
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,730
恩得斯
Enders!

773
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,960
我找不到公牛和白马
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.

774
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,310
你有看到他们吗?
Have you seen them?

775
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,470
他在那里
He's over there.

776
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,880
噢,天啊
Oh, shit...

777
01:41:57,170 --> 01:42:00,940
这里不是应该很安全吗? 怎么回事?
This was supposed to be a secured area! What happened?

778
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,780
我杀了他
I killed him.

779
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:09,810
你什么?
You... you what?

780
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:15,490
我用手榴弹 丢过去把他炸个粉碎
I took my grenade and... and I threw it and I blew him up.

781
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:26,230
你他妈的疯了!
What the hell is wrong with you?

782
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:29,970
亚吉
Yahzee!

783
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:33,370
亚吉,不要!
Yahzee! Yahzee, no!

784
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,910
起来!
Get up!

785
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:42,680
来呀,动手啊
Come on. You can do it.

786
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:45,880
放过他
- Yahzee. - Let him go.

787
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,780
亚吉,不要
Yahzee, no.

788
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:51,820
为何不…动手啊!
Go on. Why can't... Come on. Do it.

789
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,890
-动手啊! -不
- Do it! - No.

790
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:31,460
我们听说白马的事了，亚吉 我们会表扬他的功绩
We heard about Whitehorse, Yahzee. We shall honor his name and his memory.

791
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:33,570
再会，查理再会
Farewell, Charlie, farewell.

792
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:37,870
是的，查理再会
Yes, Charlie, farewell.

793
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:54,950
你知道,白马…救过我一命
You know, Whitehorse... he saved my bacon.

794
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:02,620
不知道乔治卡斯特会怎么想
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer would make of that.

795
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:10,660
记得祖父以前坐在廊下 讲猎印地安人的事
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians,

796
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,900
讲得简直像猎地鼠一般
like he was talkin' about gophers or somethin'.

797
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:19,340
猎一个赚三块美金
About gettin' paid three dollars per Comanche ear.

798
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:23,940
我知道很难想像
I know. Gets you thinkin'.

799
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:31,220
再过50年,或许我们 跟日本人会变成朋友
Another 50 years, who knows, we could be sittin' down with the Nipponese.

800
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:34,590
喝着清酒,随意哈拉
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit...

801
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:39,490
聊看看还可以打谁
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.

802
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:44,130
你想太多了
You think too much.

803
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,900
第一次有人这样称赞我
First time I ever been accused of that.

804
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:02,990
“海陆第八营第二侦察连 塞班岛”

805
01:45:54,570 --> 01:45:58,300
告诉过你别一个人到处晃
Thought I told you not to go traipsing around on your own.

806
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:10,520
你知道,查理祝福过我儿子 出生时,以纳瓦荷传统方式
You know, Charlie blessed my son in the Navajo way the day he was born.

807
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,900
他曾怀疑老美会保护我们
He wondered about cowboys watching Indians' backs.

808
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:24,000
老是感觉不对劲
Something about it didn't seem right.

809
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:27,640
我觉得查理只是多心
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.

810
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:34,140
他其实一点都不想来打仗 是我说服他的
He didn't even want to come to this damn war. I talked him into it.

811
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,080
或许你错了
Maybe you made a mistake.

812
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:53,830
大家可能都错了
Maybe we all did.

813
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:56,930
我只是奉命行事,班
I was following orders, Ben.

814
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:00,930
我奉命保护密码
My orders were to protect the code.

815
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:07,370
如果你们其中一人被补 一旦密,密码就没用了
If one of you got caught, talked, the code would be useless.

816
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:16,980
我只是奉命行事,班
I was following orders, Ben.

817
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,620
当然是,乔伊 你是他妈的杰出军人
Course you were, Joe. You're a damn good fuckin' marine.

818
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:42,200
海盗要找你
The Viking wants to see you.

819
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:45,240
他说马上
He says right away.

820
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:55,520
跟大伙说明一下怎么回事
I want you to brief everybody, make clear what's happenin'.

821
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:58,360
我打头阵没问题,枪头
All right. Got no problem with point, Gunny.

822
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:58,690
我打头阵没问题,枪头
All right. Got no problem with point, Gunny.

823
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:01,860
Yeah.

824
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,130
第八营已经出发了 我们要迎头赶上,领先他们
The 8th is moving out already and we need to be ahead of 'em.

825
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:10,040
目标是那边那块巨石
The destination is that big piece of rock you see over there.

826
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:13,510
这个岛的最后防御据点
The last defensible ridge on this island.

827
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:18,280
攻下那山头 塞班几乎就是我们的了
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount, Saipan is pretty much ours.

828
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:26,150
昨天轰炸机 把山头炸得差不多了
Yesterday, bombers beat the shit out of that rock.

829
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,790
上面很紧张,可能遭到顽抗
The brass is nervous. They expected more resistance over there.

830
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,320
要我们过去查看一下
Now they want us to go over and check it out.

831
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:37,990
他们要我们去哪里?
So where the hell they got us now?

832
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,000
翻上山头
Goin' up the mountain.

833
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:42,740
偷窥一下
Have ourselves a little peek.

834
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:48,610
要密码战士打头阵是有原因的
That codetalker is out front for a reason.

835
01:48:49,150 --> 01:48:51,580
他正好派上用场
That's exactly where I need him to be.

836
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:55,480
假如你俩之间有嫌隙
If there's still a problem between the two of you,

837
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:59,220
最好现在立刻摆平
I would like to straighten that out, right here, right now.

838
01:49:01,330 --> 01:49:03,890
-我没事的,枪头 -好极了
- No problem here, Gunny. - That's good.

839
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:06,820
但我还有一个问题
But there's still one here.

840
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,060
你只须做你该做的事
You just do what you're supposed to do, Sergeant.

841
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,230
不多也不少
Nothing more, nothing less.

842
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:21,450
恩得斯
Enders.

843
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:24,810
恩得斯,又一封你的信
You got another letter.

844
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:32,010
不要动!
Freeze!

845
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:46,960
要命!我们站在地雷区中央!
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle of a goddamn minefield!

846
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,620
奇克会带我们脱离的,是吧?
Chick's gonna get us out. Right, Chick?

847
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:52,400
当然
Sure I am.

848
01:50:54,110 --> 01:50:56,200

Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right. We'll cover you with a 30.
