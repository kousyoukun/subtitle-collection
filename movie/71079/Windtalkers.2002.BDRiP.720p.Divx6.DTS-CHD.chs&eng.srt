406
00:51:48,845 --> 00:51:50,970
I want you to do me a favor.
我想要你帮我个忙

407
00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:55,510
If anything should happen to me,
假如我遭到任何不测

408
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:58,380
you make sure that my wife gets this.

409
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:03,513
I mean, she picked them out and all.

410
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,947
Don't talk like that, Nell.
尼尔，别这么说

411
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,852
You don't even joke about shit like that.
你不要开这种玩笑

412
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,792
Now you put that ring back on. You're goin' home.
把戒指戴回去，我们会回家的

413
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,868
Hey.
嘿！

414
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,233
Don't thank me till you've tried it.
你喝看看吧，别太感谢我

415
00:53:13,705 --> 00:53:15,968
You missed mail call.
这是你掉的信

416
00:53:26,249 --> 00:53:28,409
What the hell are they doin'?
他们在做什么？

417
00:53:29,218 --> 00:53:32,015
I don't know. They've been doin' it since sundown.
我不知道，他们从日落就开始了

418
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:40,955
Sounds like some kind of prayer.
听起来像在祈福

419
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,560
Maybe they know our orders.
也许他们知道我们的任务了

420
00:54:05,313 --> 00:54:07,245
Think you could do it, Joe?
乔，如果万不得已你下的了手吗？

421
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:09,405
Give it a rest, Henderson.
翰得森，结束话题吧！

422
00:54:10,683 --> 00:54:13,242
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...
结束话题？我试着不去谈，可是…

423
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,844
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.
我是来杀日本人的，不是陆战队员

424
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,949
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...
亚吉，你是一个英勇的战士

425
00:54:25,894 --> 00:54:28,453
You will make your family proud.

426
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,494
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?
你认为你现在应该做什么？

427
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,866
Getting on my uniform.
拿我的制服

428
00:55:22,938 --> 00:55:26,633
You know the difference between you and a Jap, Yahzee?
亚吉，你知道你和日本人有什么差别吗？

429
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:31,367
It's that uniform.
制服上的差别

430
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:33,934
That's it.
就这样

431
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:37,345
See, I know you people.
我了解你们

432
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:41,376
I know what kind of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.
我知道你们这种人有多野蛮

433
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:44,447
You ought to be careful out here all alone.
你自己单独在这里可要当心

434
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:47,178
No baby-sitter.
没有人会保护你的

435
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:49,679
I might just take you for a Jap.
我还以为你是日本人

436
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:53,123
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?
约克，你先让我把衣服穿上好吗？

437
00:55:53,195 --> 00:55:56,390
Or keep demonstrating what an ignorant fool you are?
还是你还要继续你这个无聊的举动？

438
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,730
How's that for an ignorant fool?
无聊的举动那又怎么样？

439
00:56:21,516 --> 00:56:23,573
Go ahead, try again.
来呀，你给我试看看

440
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,319
You gonna do somethin'?
你以为你在做什么？

441
00:56:58,979 --> 00:57:00,502
Chick! Come on!
约克！住手！

442
00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:02,569
Get off me!
给我闪开！

443
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:24,687
- You OK, Ben? - Yeah.
班，你还好吗？　　还好

444
00:57:24,764 --> 00:57:27,095
Ben? Shit.
班？妈的

445
00:57:29,568 --> 00:57:34,333
I thought he was a Jap. You know, killed some marine for that uniform.
我还以为他是日本人，陆战队员都会穿制服

446
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,971
Sure you did, Chick.
约克，那当然

447
00:57:38,341 --> 00:57:41,172
Damn Injun looks just like a Jap, don't he?
他这个他妈的印地安人，看起来像日本人？

448
00:57:41,243 --> 00:57:43,233
Look, I'm no damn Injun.
我不是他妈的印地安人

449
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:48,813
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.
我是纳瓦荷人，亚利桑那州部落的纳瓦荷人

450
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:54,577
But you do look like a Nip.
不过你看起来像日本人

451
00:57:54,654 --> 00:57:59,612
Next time you decide to take a bath, Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.
下次你要洗澡事先告知我，不然我就踹你屁股

452
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:05,483
Fuckin' shitbird.
去你的！听你在放屁

453
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:09,323
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter all the time, I thought.
什么时候了，真像个娘们

454
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,297
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.
还在这里勾心斗角

455
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:18,126
That ceremony you saw last night? It's called a protection ceremony.
你看到昨晚的仪式了吗？它叫做辟邪仪式

456
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:25,032
Navajo believe, until a body's given a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.
纳瓦荷人相信，在人快死前，恶灵会围绕在身边

457
00:58:25,477 --> 00:58:29,969
Chindis - that's what we call evil spirits. Demons.
恶灵也就是我们所称的魔鬼

458
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:35,707
I haven't thought much about it since I was a kid.
我从前并没有想那么多

459
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:38,218
Till I saw those dead bodies.

460
00:58:38,286 --> 00:58:40,845
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?
你想跟我说你看到鬼了？

461
00:58:40,922 --> 00:58:43,432
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you I won't freeze up again.
不，中士

462
00:58:41,674 --> 00:58:43,034
我想说的是我看到尸体不会再愣住

463
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:43,796
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you I won't freeze up again.
因为你的伙伴在你的前额涂上灰烬？

464
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:46,891
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?

465
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:51,267
That's right. Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead.
没错，因为我的伙伴在我的前额涂上灰烬

466
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:01,106
You ever see ghosts?

467
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:09,750
No more stupid questions today, Private. That's an order.

468
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,318
Sounds beautiful.
吹得挺好的

469
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:46,019
You, uh, you self-taught?
是你自己学的吗？

470
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:48,991
My dad was always playing.
我爸教的

471
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,095
You know what they say: if you can't beat 'em...
你知道他们说什么吗？他说你吹不赢我们的！

472
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:58,435
No shit. My dad, he... he gave me this thing.
胡说，我爸他给我这个

473
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:02,267
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.
我们叫它口琴

474
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:06,244
Used to bring 'em in for feeding with this little tune I played.
当我吹奏它的时候我总觉得很单调

475
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,441
I know I ain't gonna get you to quit playin' that thing, so...
可是我又不能向你借笛子吹，那么…

476
01:00:10,516 --> 01:00:12,880
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...
不如我替你伴奏吧！

477
01:00:13,218 --> 01:00:15,514
I don't think it's gonna work.
我不认为它能吹出声音

478
01:00:16,955 --> 01:00:20,184
Well, we ain't got much else to do out here. What the hell?
反正我们也没什么事做，不如就来试看看

479
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:23,053
OK.
好吧！

480
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:26,558
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.
那你先吹，随后我跟着你

481
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:08,289
2nd Recon Company will move out at 0600 and scout along road 04.
第二侦查小队向0600位置移动，延190山04路侦查

01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:11,988
You can expect light resistance northwest of the palm grove. Over.
在棕榄树丛的西北方将遇到一些反抗，结束

483
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:17,161
Roger. What do you mean, light? No resistance is light! Over.
收到，一些反抗是？是指人民吗？结束

484
01:01:18,134 --> 01:01:21,329
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to question why, ours is but to do or die."
记住，陆战队员不能问为什么，只有是与不是

485
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:23,063
Semper Fi. Over.
结束

486
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,704
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?
亲爱的乔，你还好吗？

487
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:43,242
Or, given that you're not much of a writer, should I not expect an answer?
或你没时间写信，我得不到你的回应？

488
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,253
The newspapers say our boys are doing great.
报纸说我们的军人很英勇

489
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:50,815
But I don't think the reporters have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.
可记者没有去卡内奥赫湾海军医院看过

490

I found a stray dog the other day on Waikiki.

He reminded me of you - but cuter.

493
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:05,930
At least he keeps me warm at night.
多亏有它在寒风中给我温暖

494
01:02:07,072 --> 01:02:11,734
I try not to think about you. About what might be happening over there.
我试着不去想你…你那边究竟发生什么事

495
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,738
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,
不过，有时当我躺在床上

496
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:18,176
I can't keep myself from wondering where you are.

How you're doing.

What the hell you doin'?

499
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:35,791
Writing a letter to my son.

500
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,452
Forget your orders? No letters out.
你忘了命令吗？信不能寄出去的

Command don't want postmarks going to the reservation.

502
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:48,901
Hey! You hear me?
嘿，你听到没有？

503
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:57,872
I thought that he might read 'em when I get home.
我打算回家后再给他看

504
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:05,673
What's his name?

他长大后，应该会很有成就

509
01:03:20,627 --> 01:03:22,594
My wife wasn't so sure.

510

She's a little more traditional.

感觉这家人和睦　　亚吉，也让我们看看

512

You ever not miss mail call, Enders?

那是什么？　　那不是白兰地

是米酒，日本米酒，是从日本人那弄来的

For not dyin'.

又没有其他的中士愿意接手，所以…

才让我留下来负责，那是我的第一个任务

就你所记得的，关于他们的点点滴滴

638
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:18,831

究竟这事有什么魔力，让你纳瓦荷人想去知道？

639
01:20:19,473 --> 01:20:21,598

你知道，华特斯…他为了我牺牲

806
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:03,815
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer would make of that.
Wonder what 乔治 Armstrong Custer would make of that

I remember my granddaddy sittin' on the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians,
我还记得我爷爷说过他对抗印地安人的事

808
01:44:11,897 --> 01:44:15,059
like he was talkin' about gophers or somethin'.

I know. Gets you thinkin'.
我明白你现在在想什么

811
01:44:26,946 --> 01:44:32,406
Another 50 years, who knows, we could be sittin' down with the Nipponese.
可是天晓得，我们50年后会不会也是日本人

812
01:44:32,484 --> 01:44:35,781
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit...
喝他们的酒，吃他们的屎

813
01:44:37,957 --> 01:44:40,686
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.

First time I ever been accused of that.

Thought I told you not to go traipsing around on your own.
我不是跟你说过不要一个人四处乱跑

817

You know, Charlie blessed my son in the Navajo way the day he was born.
知道吗？查理在我儿子出生时用这方式祝福

Something about it didn't seem right.

I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.
我想或许是它带走查理的

He didn't even want to come to this damn war. I talked him into it.
他本来不想参加这个战争，是我要他来的

822

My orders were to protect the code.

第八步队已经到达预定的位置了

836

The last defensible ridge on this island.
那是这个岛的最后一道防线

昨天，轰炸机过去轰炸岩石那里

840
01:48:27,771 --> 01:48:32,069
The brass is nervous. They expected more resistance over there.
谁知道那些日本人是神经病，拼命抵抗

841
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:35,603
Now they want us to go over and check it out.
现在长官下令，要我们快结束战争

842

If there's still a problem between the two of you,
