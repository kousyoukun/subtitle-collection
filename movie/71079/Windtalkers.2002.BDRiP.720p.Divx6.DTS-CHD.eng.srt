1
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,794
Charlie!

2
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:24,600
I wasn't so sure you'd be on the bus.

3
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:29,941
Didn't want your white brothers
thinking you were the best we had.

4
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:18,007
SOLOMON ISLANDS
1943

5
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,925
Watch out!

6
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,091
My hand!

7
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,583
Goddamn!

8
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:07,218
We're running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.

9
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,459
Move!

10
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,903
Come on!

11
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:38,006
Come on, you can do it! Come on!

12
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:58,461
We got nothin', Enders!
We're out of ammo!

13
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,029
Joe... Nobody else needs to die.
We can go! We can get outta here!

14
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,745
We got orders!

15
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:14,407
They told us to hold the position!
And that's what we're gonna do!

16
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,484
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!

17
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:34,155
Come on!

18
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,032
Get down!

19
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:43,462
Tommy.

20
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,538
Goddamn you!

21
00:07:53,414 --> 00:07:55,175
Oh, no! No!

22
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,518
- Bill!
- I'm out.

23
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,090
Come on! Come on!

24
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,442
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.

25
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:36,974
No... No!

26
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:41,742
No!

27
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,419
Raise your right hand.

28
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:59,122
- I... State your full name...
- l, Ben Yahzee...

29
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:03,523
CAMP PENDLETON, CALIFORNIA

30
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:08,426
...do solemnly swear to support and
defend the constitution of the US...

31
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,836
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

32
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:13,669
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

33
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,266
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me
the code word for "tank"?

34
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:28,073
Come on. You boys
wanna be codetalkers.

35
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:30,982
Show me some brains. Think!

36
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:33,548
What do we call a tank?

37
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,317
Chay-da-gahi.

38
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:44,795
Tortoise. Good.

39
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:49,259
Artillery. Code word?

40
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:55,196
In code. Private Whitehorse.

41
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:57,966
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?

42
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:01,502
Very good.

43
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:03,545
Japanese Zero. Code word?

44
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:08,005
KANEOHE BAY US NAVAL HOSPITAL
1943

45
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,674
We can go! We can get outta here!

46
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,867
They told us to hold the position!

47
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,679
Nice day, huh?

48
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:03,085
Joe?

49
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,490
Joe.

50
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,461
Didn't hear a word, did you?

51
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,202
That's what happens to a man
when he's talking to a beautiful woman.

52
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:30,506
It happens when you're
not watching my lips, Joe.

53
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,807
Watch this.

54
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,792
You're a mess, Joe.
You're not fooling anybody.

55
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:03,267
No, Rita. He's a mess.

56
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,297
I'm getting better every day.

57
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:11,605
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium's all screwy.

58
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,735
You can't go back to war
if you can't stand up.

59
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:18,770
Let's go, marines. This war
ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.

60
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,243
Joe...

61
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:44,398
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?

62
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,964
Somebody's gotta keep
the WAVES company.

63
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:53,669
Are you gonna help me or not?

64
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:48,601
Marked improvement.

65
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:51,639
And his left ear is the worse of the two?

66
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:14,795
It's... amazing.

67
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:28,535
TBYhasn't got the range of the TBX.

68
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,196
So you may need a relay to get
your transmission to command post.

69
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:36,609
But what it really comes down to
is speed and accuracy under pressure.

70
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,742
Transcribe now.

71
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:42,613
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.

72
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,218
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!

73
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,488
We're losing men.

74
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,824
I need this message decrypted.

75
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:08,861
"Request fire support. We have target
at one-one-niner, Baker one-five."

76
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:11,963
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will."

77
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:19,402
Beginner's luck.

78
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:50,458
You're up, mac.

79
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,197
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.

80
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:07,542
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.

81
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,774
Better than you did as a civilian.

82
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:15,150
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.

83
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,657
Assault and battery...
on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

84
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,352
A priest?

85
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:29,194
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan
High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.

86
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,562
Public-school boy myself.

87
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,326
Some minor problems in boot.

88
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:40,031
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.

89
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:43,637
And you made a hell of a stand
on the Solomons.

90
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,803
Tough bit of business there, huh?

91
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,173
Pretty tough, sir.

92
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,547
But you're prepared
to jump right back into it?

93
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:53,478
Yes, sir. Very much so.

94
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,911
Very much so.

95
00:16:58,022 --> 00:16:59,612
Well...

96
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:06,190
The Japs have pretty much busted
every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.

97
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:09,320
You men on the Solomons
were lost to a broken code.

98
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,028
Tell me something. You ever
run into any Indians on the Solomons?

99
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,158
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.

100
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,904
The Corps has developed a new code
based on their language.

101
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,905
It's had quite an impact.

102
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:28,069
So much so the navy have decided
to go to great lengths to protect it.

103
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,369
That's why you're here.

104
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:34,569
You're to pair with one of them,
keep his ass safe.

105
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,878
Your job is to keep him alive
so he can do his job.

106
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:42,286
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,

107
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,323
not baby-sitting some Indian.

108
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,256
Enders, we didn't pick
your name out of a hat.

109
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,982
We need good marines.

110
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,691
That's why you're standing here.

111
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,595
Take a look.

112
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:57,825
It's a Navajo. Or it was.

113
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:01,835
Tortured to death by Japanese
intelligence trying to bust our code.

114
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:05,393
Fortunately, he couldn't help them
even if he wanted to.

115
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,100
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.

116
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:12,802
Code's based on their language,
but it is still a code.

117
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:17,880
Tojo would like nothing more
than to catch a live one.

118
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:23,083
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal,
cannot leave this room.

119
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:30,319
Under no circumstances can you allow
your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.

120
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:34,283
Your mission is to protect the code...

121
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:37,986
at all costs.

122
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:41,222
You understand me?

123
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:45,666
Yes, sir, I do.

124
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,432
Good.

125
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:50,132
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.

126
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:43,642
Keep those hands vertical.

127
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,705
Way to go, marine.

128
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:53,620
Fortino, take over.

129
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:59,714
Hey... That was you, right,
sitting in front of the major's office?

130
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,056
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.

131
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:06,794
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.

132
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:11,027
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.

133
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,165
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

134
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:20,582
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

135
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:20,945
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

136
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:23,245
No fuckin' idea, mac.

137
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:26,375
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

138
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:33,420
I've never seen so many white men.

139
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,893
They've never seen so many Navajo.

140
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,424
Looks to me like you got to see
a little action there.

141
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:48,164
Me too.

142
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:51,569
Jap sons of bitches
shot me right in the ass.

143
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,835
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.

144
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:03,812
So, your duty with JASCO have anything
to do with these Navajo radiomen?

145
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,375
I'm not at liberty to say.

146
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:13,084
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.

147
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:19,620
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell
me are the same orders I can't tell you.

148
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,388
Hell of a thing, huh?

149
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:24,121
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.

150
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:25,662
Yeah.

151
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,995
They look pretty normal, I guess.

152
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,434
Expecting them to wear war paint?

153
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:41,675
Maybe we ought to go introduce
ourselves. They look a little lost to me.

154
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:45,436
Henderson.

155
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,204
I wouldn't get too friendly.

156
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,010
How!

157
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:58,254
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.

158
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:00,085
Whitehorse.

159
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:02,090
This is Yahzee. Ben.

160
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:07,218
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

161
00:22:07,297 --> 00:22:10,561
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?

162
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:51,655
Mind if I join you?

163
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:56,197
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.

164
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,830
How you doin'?

165
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,697
You're blocking my view.

166
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:06,898
Oh, sorry.

167
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,675
What do they call this crap anyway?

168
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:13,804
Marines call it chow.

169
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:19,344
Well, there's a propaganda effort.

170
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:31,758
Sorry. You can have mine.

171
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,390
Shit.

172
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,725
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?

173
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:46,067
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.

174
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:49,463
Hold this.

175
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:08,916
Shit.

176
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:14,059
How's your white man?

177
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:17,485
Hungry.

178
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:31,598
I'm in for a couple more.

179
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,332
You writing to your son?

180
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:38,401
Tell him I say hello.

181
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,936
Pair of cowboys for Big E.

182
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,849
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.

183
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,978
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.

184
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,315
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.

185
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:56,786
All right.

186
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,385
OK... Oh, another mess
for the Sunshine State.

187
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:03,021
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.

188
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:05,826
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.

189
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,163
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.

190
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:11,135
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.

191
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:13,860
Call.

192
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:15,996
We all got thumbs up our asses.

193
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:21,270
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy
in Intel that says we ship out in a week.

194
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:23,368
I been hearing "next week" for a month.

195
00:25:23,446 --> 00:25:27,346
I didn't know you knew
anybody in Intelligence, Harri.

196
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,346
Next year'd be all right with me.

197
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:34,945
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.

198
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,821
Full boat, baby.

199
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:40,187
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.

200
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:43,160
Oh, Jesus!

201
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,219
Ouch. Ouch.

202
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,723
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.

203
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,131
God knows what a girl will do
without reassurance.

204
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:55,825
Son of a bitch.

205
00:25:55,905 --> 00:26:00,340
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats
opening up. You wanna come join us?

206
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,968
Are you serious?

207
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:08,605
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?

208
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:12,240
Card on the head,
only fool can't see it is you.

209
00:26:13,818 --> 00:26:16,011
You want to come on over, or what?

210
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,280
Cut me in.

211
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,426
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

212
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:34,191
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

213
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:36,060
Hey, don't let him scare you.

214
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:41,260
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's
like any other. Waste of time and money.

215
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,434
Well, ante up... Chief.

216
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:48,163
How'd you know I was a chief?

217
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,505
You must've seen me showering
with my war bonnet.

218
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,215
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.

219
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:10,279
Beautiful.

220
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,500
All right, then.

221
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:39,977
Orders finally came through.

222
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:43,173
We ship out tomorrow morning.

223
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:53,281
Destination: the island of Saipan,

224
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:58,691
which is one of the stepping stones
we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.

225
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:02,427
It's of strategic importance
that we capture this island.

226
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,260
We can get ourselves
an advanced naval base

227
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:08,664
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's

228
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:11,600
and get our bombers
within range of Tokyo.

229
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:17,901
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil,
and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.

230
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:20,465
They're gonna fight for every square inch,

231
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:24,206
because it's their home,
but we're gonna take it away from 'em!

232
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,211
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!

233
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:36,016
We're gonna be in front
of the whole damn division.

234
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,718
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.

235
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:42,052
We're gonna be
sniffin' out enemy positions,

236
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,026
coordinating the naval gunfire -

237
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:49,031
exactly what we've been training to do
for the last four months. All right?

238
00:28:56,372 --> 00:29:00,204
Now, we got some new radiomen
from headquarters.

239
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:03,164
There's a Private Whitehorse...

240
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,004
and Yahzee...

241
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:14,607
and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson,

242
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,848
who, if I'm understanding
these orders correctly,

243
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,253
will be covering our Navajos' asses.

244
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,135
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

245
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:59,983
...but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin'
into our share of the shit nonetheless.

246
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:04,581
Any questions?

247
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,598
Sounds like you're dying.

248
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:29,438
These might help get rid of the taste.

249
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:33,911
Charlie and l, we both lost it
on the boat ride from San Diego.

250
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,802
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.

251
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,507
Life Savers really helped.

252
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:41,974
You want a Life Saver?

253
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:46,613
What are you doin' here?

254
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:49,312
Just trying to help.

255
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,087
Not what I meant.

256
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:02,758
You mean what am I doing
in this uniform?

257
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,803
It's my war too, Sergeant.

258
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:09,498
I'm fighting for my country,
for my land, for my people.

259
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:13,264
Not your people I'm worried about.

260
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:17,708
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.

261
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,804
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes
to do what used to take an hour.

262
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,010
Now, somebody wearing
a lot more stripes than you

263
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:27,518
thinks that's worth something.

264
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:31,385
Remind me to time you when
you got bullets flying over your head.

265
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:40,656
What the hell's wrong with you?

266
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,433
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

267
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:55,132
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!

268
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:03,473
From the halls of Montezuma

269
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:07,448
To the shores of Tripoli

270
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:12,215
We will fight our country's battles

271
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:15,982
On the land and on the sea

272
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,588
First to fight for right and freedom

273
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,321
And to keep our honor clean

274
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,655
We are proud to claim the title

275
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:32,532
Of United States Marines

276
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:50,237
Hi.

277
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:54,275
How's that ear?

278
00:32:54,987 --> 00:32:58,853
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if
it starts aching, take a couple of those.

279
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:01,049
And call me in the morning.

280
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,317
You're not gonna be here
in the morning, are you?

281
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:12,391
Shipping out without even
buying me a drink.

282
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:17,458
Ought to be ashamed of yourself,
hustling a... hustling marines.

283
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,406
What's your poison?

284
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:26,466
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I'll get a shot of something.

285
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:28,102
Rum.

286
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:30,802
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.

287
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:32,874
Make that two.

288
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:34,939
May as well join me, huh?

289
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:37,744
- Why not?
- OK.

290
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,978
Thank you.

291
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:46,984
Well... to war.

292
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:05,094
THE JAPANESE ISLAND OF SAIPAN
JUNE 16, 1944

293
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:18,046
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

294
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:32,790
Get those men spread out!

295
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,156
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!

296
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,891
Come on, keep up!

297
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:14,036
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on!

298
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:36,614
- How am I doin'?
- You're good.

299
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:48,295
Let's go!

300
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:51,030
Stay on my ass.

301
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:11,277
I told you to stay on my ass!

302
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,623
- Stay low!
- Get out of there!

303
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,791
Go!

304
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,485
Get him outta there!

305
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,550
Get me outta here!

306
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:42,163
- Hold still, damn it!
- Get him outta there!

307
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:56,170
You sons of bitches!

308
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,142
Fortino! Cover me!

309
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:03,205
Whitehorse, get down!

310
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:35,006
Get down!

311
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:49,457
Pappas!

312
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:56,363
Corpsman!

313
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:59,060
Helmet goes on your head! Corpsman!

314
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:01,658
Take care of him.

315
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:06,396
Put a hand on this.

316
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,508
Tank! Tank! Tank!

317
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:28,448
You ready? Go! Go!

318
00:41:33,661 --> 00:41:35,651
Harrigan, light it up!

319
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,070
Let's go, boys! Keep up the fight!

320
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,311
Are you hit? Are you hit?

321
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:09,020
You're OK. You're good, you're good.

322
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:12,758
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.

323
00:42:13,061 --> 00:42:15,926
- Harri?
- You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy.

324
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:18,328
- Stay low!
- Nellie? Pappas?

325
00:42:18,398 --> 00:42:20,388
Yeah, we're good.

326
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:24,359
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate.

327
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:25,698
What?

328
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:28,566
I can't breathe when I get excited.

329
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,698
Goddamn! Must be hell on your gal!

330
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,325
Enders, get the navy on the horn
and tell 'em to dig out those guns.

331
00:42:58,538 --> 00:43:01,403
Target reference... dog one...

332
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:04,067
right 700.

333
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:06,573
Elevation zero-five-zero.

334
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:16,347
Relay the damn coordinates!

335
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:22,355
Arizona! Arizona!

336
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,799
USS CALIFORNIA

337
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:57,244
It sounds like they're underwater.
Is it English?

338
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:11,490
Target reference, dog one,

339
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:15,393
south 700, elevation zero-five-zero.

340
00:44:38,514 --> 00:44:40,242
Right 200!

341
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:43,582
Up 50. Fire for effect.

342
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:16,306
Let's go!

343
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:17,899
Move!

344
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,900
Harrigan!

345
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:04,935
Torch the box!

346
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:57,614
Kill him!

347
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:24,131
Goddamn it!

348
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:28,074
Shit.

349
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:32,442
Nellie. Take the satchel charge.

350
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,275
You hear me? Move!

351
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:43,517
You're gonna cover me, right?

352
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,684
I'll go with you. We flank left.

353
00:47:46,393 --> 00:47:48,689
I'll cover you. Smoke and cover.

354
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:50,752
I can do this.

355
00:47:53,399 --> 00:47:55,389
I can do this.

356
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:07,165
Smoke 'em up!

357
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,603
Cover up.

358
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:07,411
Shit!

359
00:49:14,193 --> 00:49:17,319
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!

360
00:49:25,468 --> 00:49:27,367
Heads up around 0500.

361
00:49:27,437 --> 00:49:30,996
You're going to have replacements
and ammo coming up. Over.

362
00:49:32,308 --> 00:49:34,433
Roger. Make sure
they have the new password.

363
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,874
Challenge: "Wind." Answer: "Talkers."

364
00:49:36,945 --> 00:49:40,344
That's what one of our Navajo brothers
calls us. What do you think? Over.

365
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:47,181
"Windtalkers," I like it. OK, Kemo Sabe,
keep your butts down tonight. Over.

366
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:51,681
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?

367
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:55,578
You are a whiny son of a bitch
right now, aren't you?

368
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,956
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does
that make it on the East Coast?

369
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:04,595
How the fucking hell should I know?

370
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:07,356
Just seven...

371
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:10,625
It's 8am, Sunday morning.

372
00:50:11,237 --> 00:50:14,137
I hope my side of the bed
didn't get taken up Saturday night.

373
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:18,332
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer,
you keep worrying about her.

374
00:50:18,409 --> 00:50:20,569
Might get my ass
sent back to Rhody, though.

375
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:25,011
There's plenty of dollies outside
of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty.

376
00:50:25,081 --> 00:50:28,310
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.
- Ain't that the truth.

377
00:50:28,384 --> 00:50:33,513
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.

378
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:36,385
This one time, before the war,

379
00:50:36,457 --> 00:50:43,417
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little
thing named Molly comes out the water.

380
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:47,394
She walks straight up to me
and asks me if I'm hungry...

381
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:50,430
cos she's havin' a weenie roast.

382
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:52,400
Shit! Damn.

383
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:54,965
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.

384
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,339
Now I'm on Saipan with this
giant Zippo strapped to my back

385
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,673
and I'm roastin' human beings.

386
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:15,608
Why I volunteered... beyond me.

387
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:20,211
Damn, I'm proud to be here.

388
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,722
My whole family's been in the Corps.

389
00:51:23,593 --> 00:51:25,650
My old man, he's a lifer.

390
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:28,655
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.

391
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:31,153
Around the house too.

392
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:37,930
Maybe now he'll back off.

393
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:47,299
Pappas, I...

394
00:51:48,845 --> 00:51:50,970
I want you to do me a favor.

395
00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:55,510
If anything should happen to me,

396
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:58,380
you make sure that my wife gets this.

397
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:03,513
I mean, she picked them out and all.

398
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,947
Don't talk like that, Nell.

399
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,852
You don't even joke about shit like that.

400
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,792
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.

401
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,868
Hey.

402
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,233
Don't thank me till you've tried it.

403
00:53:13,705 --> 00:53:15,968
You missed mail call.

404
00:53:26,249 --> 00:53:28,409
What the hell are they doin'?

405
00:53:29,218 --> 00:53:32,015
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.

406
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:40,955
Sounds like some kind of prayer.

407
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,560
Maybe they know our orders.

408
00:54:05,313 --> 00:54:07,245
Think you could do it, Joe?

409
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:09,405
Give it a rest, Henderson.

410
00:54:10,683 --> 00:54:13,242
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...

411
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,844
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.

412
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,949
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...

413
00:54:25,894 --> 00:54:28,453
You will make your family proud.

414
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,494
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

415
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,866
Getting on my uniform.

416
00:55:22,938 --> 00:55:26,633
You know the difference
between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

417
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:31,367
It's that uniform.

418
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:33,934
That's it.

419
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:37,345
See, I know you people.

420
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:41,376
I know what kind
of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.

421
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:44,447
You ought to be careful out here all alone.

422
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:47,178
No baby-sitter.

423
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:49,679
I might just take you for a Jap.

424
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:53,123
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

425
00:55:53,195 --> 00:55:56,390
Or keep demonstrating
what an ignorant fool you are?

426
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,730
How's that for an ignorant fool?

427
00:56:21,516 --> 00:56:23,573
Go ahead, try again.

428
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,319
You gonna do somethin'?

429
00:56:58,979 --> 00:57:00,502
Chick! Come on!

430
00:57:00,579 --> 00:57:02,569
Get off me!

431
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:24,687
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.

432
00:57:24,764 --> 00:57:27,095
Ben? Shit.

433
00:57:29,568 --> 00:57:34,333
I thought he was a Jap. You know,
killed some marine for that uniform.

434
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,971
Sure you did, Chick.

435
00:57:38,341 --> 00:57:41,172
Damn Injun looks just like
a Jap, don't he?

436
00:57:41,243 --> 00:57:43,233
Look, I'm no damn Injun.

437
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:48,813
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,
born for the Towering House clan.

438
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:54,577
But you do look like a Nip.

439
00:57:54,654 --> 00:57:59,612
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.

440
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:05,483
Fuckin' shitbird.

441
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:09,323
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter
all the time, I thought.

442
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,297
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.

443
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:18,126
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.

444
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:25,032
Navajo believe, until a body's given
a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.

445
00:58:25,477 --> 00:58:29,969
Chindis - that's what
we call evil spirits. Demons.

446
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:35,707
I haven't thought much about it
since I was a kid.

447
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:38,218
Till I saw those dead bodies.

448
00:58:38,286 --> 00:58:40,845
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

449
00:58:40,922 --> 00:58:43,432
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.

450
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:43,796
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.

451
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:46,891
Because your buddy
smeared ash on your forehead?

452
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:51,267
That's right. Cos my buddy
smeared ash on my forehead.

453
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:01,106
You ever see ghosts?

454
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:09,750
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.

455
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,318
Sounds beautiful.

456
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:46,019
You, uh, you self-taught?

457
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:48,991
My dad was always playing.

458
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,095
You know what they say:
if you can't beat 'em...

459
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:58,435
No shit. My dad, he...
he gave me this thing.

460
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:02,267
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.

461
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:06,244
Used to bring 'em in for feeding
with this little tune I played.

462
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,441
I know I ain't gonna get you
to quit playin' that thing, so...

463
01:00:10,516 --> 01:00:12,880
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...

464
01:00:13,218 --> 01:00:15,514
I don't think it's gonna work.

465
01:00:16,955 --> 01:00:20,184
Well, we ain't got much else
to do out here. What the hell?

466
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:23,053
OK.

467
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:26,558
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.

468
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:08,289
2nd Recon Company will move out
at 0600 and scout along road 04.

469
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:11,988
You can expect light resistance
northwest of the palm grove. Over.

470
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:17,161
Roger. What do you mean, light?
No resistance is light! Over.

471
01:01:18,134 --> 01:01:21,329
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to
question why, ours is but to do or die."

472
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:23,063
Semper Fi. Over.

473
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,704
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

474
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:43,242
Or, given that you're not much of a
writer, should I not expect an answer?

475
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,253
The newspapers say
our boys are doing great.

476
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:50,815
But I don't think the reporters
have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.

477
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:54,987
I found a stray dog
the other day on Waikiki.

478
01:01:55,062 --> 01:01:57,791
I gave him a bath and took him in.

479
01:01:57,866 --> 01:02:01,391
He reminded me of you - but cuter.

480
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:05,930
At least he keeps me warm at night.

481
01:02:07,072 --> 01:02:11,734
I try not to think about you. About
what might be happening over there.

482
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,738
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,

483
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:18,176
I can't keep myself
from wondering where you are.

484
01:02:18,248 --> 01:02:20,238
How you're doing.

485
01:02:30,689 --> 01:02:32,712
What the hell you doin'?

486
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:35,791
Writing a letter to my son.

487
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,452
Forget your orders? No letters out.

488
01:02:39,096 --> 01:02:42,291
Command don't want postmarks
going to the reservation.

489
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:48,901
Hey! You hear me?

490
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:57,872
I thought that he might read 'em
when I get home.

491
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:05,673
What's his name?

492
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,682
Your son.

493
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:11,247
It's George. George Washington.

494
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:14,849
George Washington Yahzee.

495
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,151
It's got a bit of a ring to it.

496
01:03:20,627 --> 01:03:22,594
My wife wasn't so sure.

497
01:03:23,063 --> 01:03:25,529
She's a little more traditional.

498
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:30,790
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.

499
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:35,531
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.

500
01:03:39,075 --> 01:03:41,200
Can I try one of those?

501
01:03:41,977 --> 01:03:44,877
- You smoke?
- Not really.

502
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,176
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!

503
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:29,268
Let's go! Let's go!

504
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,847
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

505
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:42,778
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!

506
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:45,885
Yahzee!

507
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:48,951
I'm hit!

508
01:04:49,028 --> 01:04:51,291
Take it off! It burns!

509
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:58,223
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit.

510
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,616
- Spread out!
- Move!

511
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:31,499
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.

512
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:33,534
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.

513
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:38,125
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.

514
01:05:38,206 --> 01:05:40,070
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!

515
01:05:40,141 --> 01:05:44,542
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.

516
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,278
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.

517
01:05:50,348 --> 01:05:51,974
Do somethin'.

518
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,538
Shit... Follow me!

519
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,347
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!

520
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:20,927
God.

521
01:06:43,622 --> 01:06:45,316
Son of a bitch!

522
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,164
I got you, mac!

523
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:15,941
Corpsman!

524
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,412
Corpsman!

525
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,877
Corpsman!

526
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:30,413
Nellie!

527
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:36,184
Corpsman!

528
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:08,069
You were right, Joe.

529
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:10,594
I do look like a Nip.

530
01:08:10,668 --> 01:08:12,753
What the hell are you talking about?

531
01:08:12,831 --> 01:08:17,253
Putting on that Jap uniform. Trying to get
one of their radios, call off our guns.

532
01:08:17,321 --> 01:08:20,074
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.

533
01:08:20,147 --> 01:08:23,264
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.

534
01:08:23,341 --> 01:08:25,891
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!

535
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,966
He's just a kid! You killed your own!

536
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:38,303
What's wrong with you?
You killed your own! Sons of bitches!

537
01:08:39,075 --> 01:08:41,372
You killed your own!

538
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:00,760
- Sure you're up to this?
- Find out soon enough, sir.

539
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:06,830
- What the hell are you doin' there?
- I'm goin' with him.

540
01:09:06,904 --> 01:09:09,167
If that's OK with you.

541
01:09:12,543 --> 01:09:14,532
Give me the rifle.

542
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:20,113
Horyo-da.

543
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:22,810
It's Jap for prisoner.

544
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:25,579
Horyo-da.

545
01:09:33,532 --> 01:09:35,589
Horyo-da.

546
01:09:38,538 --> 01:09:40,869
All right, everybody be ready.

547
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:39,759
Horyo-da!

548
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:47,465
Now!

549
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:48,490
Now!

550
01:10:59,512 --> 01:11:01,341
Hit me. Hit me.

551
01:11:17,197 --> 01:11:19,186
Please don't hit me!

552
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:00,239
Yahzee!

553
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,814
Kill him!

554
01:12:17,294 --> 01:12:19,453
Goddamn it, kill him!

555
01:12:26,069 --> 01:12:27,898
Get on the radio!

556
01:12:36,348 --> 01:12:39,441
Bowie White, Bowie White,
this is Carson Red!

557
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:45,113
Cease fire! Cease fire!
You're shelling marines!

558
01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:48,480
Sergeant!

559
01:12:50,963 --> 01:12:53,055
Cease fire! Cease fire!

560
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:58,327
Add 325, fire for effect!

561
01:12:59,571 --> 01:13:03,266
Redirect fire. Add 325, fire for effect.

562
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:05,865
Let's go!

563
01:13:08,247 --> 01:13:10,339
Crank it up! Let's go!

564
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:12,110
Commence fire!

565
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:14,013
Fire!

566
01:13:19,893 --> 01:13:21,415
Yeah!

567
01:13:21,494 --> 01:13:23,084
Well, I'll be.

568
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,753
Colonel. Can I help you, sir?

569
01:13:51,826 --> 01:13:55,625
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders.
Joseph F Enders.

570
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,594
Enders.

571
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,005
Yes, sir.

572
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:13,009
Report I read claims
you went above and beyond.

573
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:15,811
Sir?

574
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,284
You've been recommended
for commendation.

575
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:21,617
And I concur. But I don't see any point
in you having to wait around

576
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:26,024
for all those formalities
to work themselves out.

577
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,229
Not when I got one of these handy.

578
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:32,400
Congratulations, Enders.

579
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,594
You saved a lot of marines.

580
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,012
I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have
done it without Private Ben Yahzee.

581
01:14:48,086 --> 01:14:50,553
Oh... Right.

582
01:14:51,422 --> 01:14:53,411
The, uh, Indian.

583
01:14:54,826 --> 01:14:58,454
Begging the colonel's pardon,
he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,

584
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,553
born for the Towering House clan.

585
01:15:01,266 --> 01:15:06,827
Of course. Navajo. Towering House clan.

586
01:15:13,312 --> 01:15:15,541
You keep up the good work, Enders.

587
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:56,586
Send that to Nellie's wife.

588
01:16:37,033 --> 01:16:39,898
You ever not miss mail call, Enders?

589
01:16:46,809 --> 01:16:49,436
My mom says somebody
takes the time to write a letter,

590
01:16:49,513 --> 01:16:51,742
you should read the letter.

591
01:16:54,585 --> 01:16:57,075
Does she let you drink, your mother?

592
01:16:57,688 --> 01:17:00,315
No. But she's not here.

593
01:17:14,405 --> 01:17:18,169
- What is it?
- Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that.

594
01:17:18,243 --> 01:17:21,439
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake.
But it does the trick.

595
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:27,578
How much of this crap
do you have anyway?

596
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:33,118
You have a little trouble with that ear,
don't you, Joe?

597
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:38,458
Ah, real problem's the inner ear.
It's anvils and stirrups and shit.

598
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:43,361
I'm a little out of balance.

599
01:17:45,939 --> 01:17:49,147
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee.

600
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:51,406
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

601
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:54,746
I bet I surprised the shit out of you.

602
01:18:00,026 --> 01:18:02,425
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe.

603
01:18:03,063 --> 01:18:05,496
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife.

604
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,994
I don't give a shit about medals.

605
01:18:18,212 --> 01:18:20,406
The first one they gave me...

606
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:24,175
I threw it into the ocean.

607
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,744
What'd you get that one for?

608
01:18:28,823 --> 01:18:30,584
For not dyin'.

609
01:18:32,327 --> 01:18:37,286
The 15 men who fought with me
got decorated too. For dying.

610
01:18:37,965 --> 01:18:39,555
So...

611
01:18:44,406 --> 01:18:47,568
Lieutenant was killed
the night before and...

612
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:53,781
none of the sergeants even made it
out of the landing craft, so...

613
01:18:56,219 --> 01:18:59,415
that left me in charge.
It was my first command.

614
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:08,051
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp
marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.

615
01:19:11,602 --> 01:19:13,591
And I did.

616
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,965
All of the men under my command...

617
01:19:25,316 --> 01:19:27,305
men who trusted me...

618
01:19:32,424 --> 01:19:35,881
who begged me to pull back...

619
01:19:40,532 --> 01:19:42,521
not one of them made it.

620
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:49,429
Just one stupid asshole.

621
01:19:55,214 --> 01:19:58,671
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.

622
01:20:01,688 --> 01:20:03,847
What were their names?

623
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,684
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.

624
01:20:08,295 --> 01:20:11,092
You know, who they were
and what they were like.

625
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:18,831
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit.
What the hell for?

626
01:20:19,473 --> 01:20:21,598
To honor them.

627
01:20:22,376 --> 01:20:24,365
Their memory.

628
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:30,112
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe.
You were just followin' orders.

629
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,746
Yeah.

630
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,754
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

631
01:20:39,328 --> 01:20:41,761
That's why they gave me this detail.

632
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:48,128
Yeah.

633
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,901
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

634
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:22,500
- Joe!
- What?

635
01:21:27,877 --> 01:21:30,208
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

636
01:21:30,281 --> 01:21:31,747
Really.

637
01:21:48,433 --> 01:21:50,422
It's all right.

638
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,960
Come on, Joe. I got you.

639
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,312
What the fuck?

640
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:24,854
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee.
You cut that horseshit out.

641
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:01,865
What's your expected arrival
to the village? Over.

642
01:24:02,607 --> 01:24:06,097
Around 1500. Aerial Reconnaissance
reports no movement, looks secure.

643
01:24:06,177 --> 01:24:08,406
Request hot chow and mail if possible.
Over.

644
01:24:10,047 --> 01:24:14,311
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in
this Swedish concoction called yoghurt.

645
01:24:14,386 --> 01:24:17,081
God willin', America
will develop the taste.

646
01:24:17,556 --> 01:24:22,296
What about you, Charlie? What's life
got in store for you after this mess?

647
01:24:22,431 --> 01:24:22,862
Sheep.

648
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:25,989
Sheep? As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?

649
01:24:28,336 --> 01:24:32,270
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock
in the Four Corners area.

650
01:24:32,341 --> 01:24:34,330
No shit?

651
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:38,410
- You a rich man, Whitehorse?
- We do OK.

652
01:24:38,481 --> 01:24:42,884
Taxis. A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em.
That's how I'm making my millions.

653
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,854
And then I'm goin' back
to the motherland.

654
01:24:46,922 --> 01:24:50,015
I'm gonna build myself a villa
on the cliffs of Santorini.

655
01:24:50,093 --> 01:24:53,390
Ah, Santorini, my friends - that's living.

656
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:57,660
Sounds nice. What about you, Zee?

657
01:24:58,368 --> 01:25:00,267
Thinkin' about teaching.

658
01:25:00,336 --> 01:25:04,532
Ah, teaching. Bring a little something
back to the reservation?

659
01:25:04,608 --> 01:25:09,635
Actually, more interested in bringing
some of the reservation back to the world.

660
01:25:09,714 --> 01:25:12,443
Hoping to teach college.
American history.

661
01:25:12,517 --> 01:25:14,449
Oh, that's just what we need.

662
01:25:14,518 --> 01:25:19,386
Yahzee teachin' college boys about
Custer's scalpin' at Little Bighorn.

663
01:25:20,092 --> 01:25:23,959
And what about Kit Carson, and what
they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?

664
01:25:24,028 --> 01:25:26,518
You ever read about that, Chick?

665
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:29,154
Didn't think so.

666
01:25:30,568 --> 01:25:32,557
How about you, Joe?

667
01:25:33,472 --> 01:25:36,235
- What?
- What are you doin' after this mess?

668
01:25:36,308 --> 01:25:38,297
It's gotta end sometime.

669
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:45,210
Dear Joe, we got great news today.

670
01:25:45,851 --> 01:25:49,979
President Roosevelt announced
the end of blackouts on Hawaii.

671
01:25:50,056 --> 01:25:52,683
We thought the day would never come.

672
01:25:53,693 --> 01:25:57,889
There's still a ten o'clock curfew,
but it doesn't matter to me.

673
01:25:58,531 --> 01:26:03,263
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired
to do anything but write letters.

674
01:26:05,973 --> 01:26:11,137
There is a real sense that the war
is going well, and could be over soon.

675
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:18,142
I think about you more and more.
If you're alive or dead out there.

676
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:23,616
I check the mail every day, knowing
there's going to be an answer.

677
01:26:23,692 --> 01:26:26,091
Are you reading these, Joe?

678
01:26:26,594 --> 01:26:28,583
Are you listening?

679
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:36,665
- We're secure on the left side.
- Area's secured.

680
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:38,932
Set up defense positions.

681
01:26:39,008 --> 01:26:41,237
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.

682
01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:43,104
Harri.

683
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:39,967
What's wrong?

684
01:27:40,905 --> 01:27:42,495
I'm hurting.

685
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:51,080
Here's some pain reliever.

686
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:06,827
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

687
01:28:12,438 --> 01:28:13,734
Thank you, Uncle.

688
01:28:33,493 --> 01:28:36,325
That's startin' to sound like something.

689
01:29:24,576 --> 01:29:26,770
I didn't know you were an artist.

690
01:29:27,146 --> 01:29:29,009
Oh, it's stupid.

691
01:29:29,081 --> 01:29:34,589
It's just something I would do as a kid
on my grandmother's kitchen table.

692
01:29:35,056 --> 01:29:37,022
Well, it's nice.

693
01:29:37,092 --> 01:29:39,081
You Catholic?

694
01:29:41,597 --> 01:29:43,586
I used to be.

695
01:29:45,067 --> 01:29:48,229
I was thinkin' about
when they confirmed me.

696
01:29:48,304 --> 01:29:51,739
I was eight, and they anointed me
with the holy water.

697
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:53,966
And I remember...

698
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:58,739
they told me I was a soldier of Christ.

699
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,352
I guess somewhere along the way
I must have switched units.

700
01:30:08,592 --> 01:30:10,581
It's oil.

701
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:15,862
They don't use holy water to confirm.
They use oil.

702
01:30:16,733 --> 01:30:18,858
I was raised Catholic too.

703
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:21,870
Mission school on the reservation.

704
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:27,104
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us
talking Navajo at Mass.

705
01:30:28,614 --> 01:30:31,081
Of course, one Sunday I forgot.

706
01:30:32,518 --> 01:30:36,612
They punished me by tying me
to the radiator in the basement.

707
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:38,678
For two days.

708
01:30:40,258 --> 01:30:41,986
I think I was eight too.

709
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:45,624
Well, they're sure
lettin' you talk Navajo now.

710
01:30:45,698 --> 01:30:47,391
Yeah.

711
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:59,142
You know, when this is over, maybe
you should come out to Navajo country.

712
01:31:00,046 --> 01:31:03,845
Monument Valley is a beautiful place.
It's peaceful.

713
01:31:04,384 --> 01:31:07,750
You know, we could do some things
that you don't do in the Corps.

714
01:31:07,821 --> 01:31:13,382
Like ride horses, eat fry bread,
do some hunting...

715
01:31:16,163 --> 01:31:18,152
Horses.

716
01:31:23,238 --> 01:31:26,763
I don't know.
It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.

717
01:31:26,841 --> 01:31:30,571
But it might be worth it.
You know, you could meet my son.

718
01:31:31,179 --> 01:31:33,738
And he could meet Joe Enders,

719
01:31:34,616 --> 01:31:39,075
the guy who watched
over Daddy's scrawny ass.

720
01:31:43,658 --> 01:31:46,125
You must be a very good father, Ben.

721
01:31:47,929 --> 01:31:51,988
Ben. You know,
you've never called me that before.

722
01:31:53,936 --> 01:31:57,496
Enders. What kind of name
is that anyway?

723
01:31:58,108 --> 01:32:03,636
It's ltalian. Used to be Endrolfini before
some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it.

724
01:32:05,781 --> 01:32:09,078
Captain needs to code a message
back to command post.

725
01:32:09,152 --> 01:32:10,709
You the Indian?

726
01:32:10,787 --> 01:32:13,084
Yeah, I'm the Indian.

727
01:32:13,156 --> 01:32:16,555
It's just a few minutes' drive.
We'll get you back in no time.

728
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,915
- I need to speak with you, Gunny.
- Yeah. Give me a second.

729
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:50,291
Got this with the mail today.
You ever had pickled herring?

730
01:32:52,598 --> 01:32:54,587
I need out.

731
01:32:55,133 --> 01:32:57,692
What the hell are you talkin' about?

732
01:32:57,770 --> 01:32:59,759
This detail.

733
01:33:00,172 --> 01:33:02,229
My duty.

734
01:33:02,306 --> 01:33:04,295
I can't do it.

735
01:33:04,843 --> 01:33:07,106
Well, I need you, Enders.

736
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:09,909
Yeah. You've been saving
a lot of marines.

737
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:18,553
I'm requesting mast with
battalion commander. I want out.

738
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:24,928
Oh, yeah? You and me and every
other mother's son. We all want out.

739
01:33:25,699 --> 01:33:29,463
Well, as long as there's
a Tojo and a Hitler out there

740
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:32,630
we have to keep on fighting.
Is that understood?

741
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,336
- You're not hearing me.
- I'm hearing you just fine.

742
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:40,738
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide,

743
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:44,650
and it ain't bein' waged
on your wants and wishes.

744
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,380
Now you get some sack time.
That's an order.

745
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:49,719
Goddamn it! I can't do it!

746
01:33:50,357 --> 01:33:52,654
I can't perform my duty!

747
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:10,202
Hey there, sweetheart.

748
01:34:10,278 --> 01:34:12,370
Hi. It's OK.

749
01:34:13,182 --> 01:34:16,207
You don't have to cry.
You're gonna be all right.

750
01:34:18,787 --> 01:34:20,912
Got a present for you.

751
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:25,416
This is chocolate.

752
01:34:27,196 --> 01:34:29,925
You see, you eat it... and it's good.

753
01:34:34,738 --> 01:34:36,727
It's good.

754
01:34:37,174 --> 01:34:39,368
You want some?

755
01:34:42,546 --> 01:34:44,535
You'll have to chew it next time. Here.

756
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,319
Harrigan, go!

757
01:35:08,907 --> 01:35:10,736
Incoming!

758
01:35:19,485 --> 01:35:21,178
Run!

759
01:35:21,253 --> 01:35:22,742
Go! Run!

760
01:35:22,822 --> 01:35:24,981
Harrigan! Make her run!

761
01:35:26,592 --> 01:35:28,581
Come on! To me!

762
01:35:46,313 --> 01:35:48,346
Harrigan!

763
01:36:55,152 --> 01:36:57,381
Come on, keep moving!

764
01:37:21,213 --> 01:37:23,202
Fall back!

765
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:28,273
Help! Help!

766
01:38:44,566 --> 01:38:46,623
I can't let 'em take us.

767
01:38:49,639 --> 01:38:51,902
What are you talking about?

768
01:39:43,328 --> 01:39:44,588
Don't kill him.

769
01:39:44,762 --> 01:39:45,955
He's important.

770
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:49,265
We need to interrogate him.

771
01:41:19,796 --> 01:41:21,785
Enders!

772
01:41:22,766 --> 01:41:25,029
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.

773
01:41:28,438 --> 01:41:30,370
Have you seen them?

774
01:41:31,709 --> 01:41:33,538
He's over there.

775
01:41:37,081 --> 01:41:38,944
Oh, shit...

776
01:41:58,169 --> 01:42:02,001
This was supposed to be a secured area!
What happened?

777
01:42:05,443 --> 01:42:07,842
I killed him.

778
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:10,873
You... you what?

779
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:16,543
I took my grenade and...
and I threw it and I blew him up.

780
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:27,381
What the hell is wrong with you?

781
01:42:29,589 --> 01:42:31,146
Yahzee!

782
01:42:31,458 --> 01:42:34,085
Yahzee! Yahzee, no!

783
01:42:34,594 --> 01:42:36,083
Get up!

784
01:42:41,067 --> 01:42:43,864
Come on. You can do it.

785
01:42:43,938 --> 01:42:46,701
- Yahzee.
- Let him go.

786
01:42:47,141 --> 01:42:48,970
Yahzee, no.

787
01:42:50,178 --> 01:42:53,010
Go on. Why can't... Come on. Do it.

788
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,069
- Do it!
- No.

789
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:32,648
We heard about Whitehorse, Yahzee. We
shall honor his name and his memory.

790
01:43:32,722 --> 01:43:34,745
Farewell, Charlie, farewell.

791
01:43:35,658 --> 01:43:39,024
Yes, Charlie, farewell.

792
01:43:52,343 --> 01:43:56,142
You know, Whitehorse...
he saved my bacon.

793
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:03,815
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer
would make of that.

794
01:44:06,524 --> 01:44:11,824
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on
the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians,

795
01:44:11,897 --> 01:44:15,059
like he was talkin'
about gophers or somethin'.

796
01:44:16,434 --> 01:44:20,528
About gettin' paid three dollars
per Comanche ear.

797
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:25,133
I know. Gets you thinkin'.

798
01:44:26,946 --> 01:44:32,406
Another 50 years, who knows, we could
be sittin' down with the Nipponese.

799
01:44:32,484 --> 01:44:35,781
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit...

800
01:44:37,957 --> 01:44:40,686
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.

801
01:44:43,329 --> 01:44:45,318
You think too much.

802
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:53,097
First time I ever been accused of that.

803
01:45:55,705 --> 01:45:59,504
Thought I told you not to go
traipsing around on your own.

804
01:46:06,316 --> 01:46:11,719
You know, Charlie blessed my son
in the Navajo way the day he was born.

805
01:46:18,696 --> 01:46:22,062
He wondered about cowboys
watching Indians' backs.

806
01:46:22,734 --> 01:46:25,167
Something about it didn't seem right.

807
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:28,804
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.

808
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:35,339
He didn't even want to come
to this damn war. I talked him into it.

809
01:46:39,484 --> 01:46:41,279
Maybe you made a mistake.

810
01:46:52,732 --> 01:46:54,995
Maybe we all did.

811
01:46:56,169 --> 01:46:58,101
I was following orders, Ben.

812
01:46:59,372 --> 01:47:02,101
My orders were to protect the code.

813
01:47:02,942 --> 01:47:08,573
If one of you got caught, talked,
the code would be useless.

814
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:18,182
I was following orders, Ben.

815
01:47:21,296 --> 01:47:25,823
Course you were, Joe.
You're a damn good fuckin' marine.

816
01:47:41,316 --> 01:47:43,408
The Viking wants to see you.

817
01:47:44,352 --> 01:47:46,444
He says right away.

818
01:47:53,663 --> 01:47:56,721
I want you to brief everybody,
make clear what's happenin'.

819
01:47:56,799 --> 01:47:59,639
All right. Got no problem
with point, Gunny.

820
01:47:59,775 --> 01:48:01,798
- That's good.
- You wanted to see me?

821
01:48:01,876 --> 01:48:03,136
Yeah.

822
01:48:03,212 --> 01:48:07,408
The 8th is moving out already
and we need to be ahead of 'em.

823
01:48:07,484 --> 01:48:11,351
The destination is that big piece of rock
you see over there.

824
01:48:11,421 --> 01:48:14,820
The last defensible ridge on this island.

825
01:48:14,891 --> 01:48:19,589
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount,
Saipan is pretty much ours.

826
01:48:23,333 --> 01:48:27,461
Yesterday, bombers
beat the shit out of that rock.

827
01:48:27,771 --> 01:48:32,069
The brass is nervous. They expected
more resistance over there.

828
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:35,603
Now they want us to go over
and check it out.

829
01:48:36,679 --> 01:48:39,272
So where the hell they got us now?

830
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:41,282
Goin' up the mountain.

831
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,051
Have ourselves a little peek.

832
01:48:46,191 --> 01:48:49,921
That codetalker is out front for a reason.

833
01:48:50,395 --> 01:48:52,885
That's exactly where I need him to be.

834
01:48:54,031 --> 01:48:56,794
If there's still a problem
between the two of you,

835
01:48:56,869 --> 01:49:00,530
I would like to straighten that out,
right here, right now.

836
01:49:02,541 --> 01:49:05,202
- No problem here, Gunny.
- That's good.

837
01:49:05,945 --> 01:49:08,104
But there's still one here.

838
01:49:09,614 --> 01:49:12,343
You just do what you're
supposed to do, Sergeant.

839
01:49:12,418 --> 01:49:14,510
Nothing more, nothing less.

840
01:49:20,761 --> 01:49:22,750
Enders.

841
01:49:23,896 --> 01:49:26,125
You got another letter.

842
01:50:31,434 --> 01:50:33,333
Freeze!

843
01:50:44,347 --> 01:50:48,247
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle
of a goddamn minefield!

844
01:50:48,318 --> 01:50:50,911
Chick's gonna get us out. Right, Chick?

845
01:50:51,688 --> 01:50:53,677
Sure I am.

846
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:57,518
One line after Chick.

847
01:51:02,333 --> 01:51:04,322
Pappas.

848
01:51:06,404 --> 01:51:08,267
Pappas.

849
01:51:09,408 --> 01:51:11,397
Move, Greek.

850
01:51:11,943 --> 01:51:14,672
I'm gonna get my fuckin' balls
blown off out here!

851
01:51:22,054 --> 01:51:24,043
Yahzee! Stop!

852
01:51:46,112 --> 01:51:48,101
Move out!

853
01:52:27,756 --> 01:52:29,278
Yahzee!

854
01:52:29,959 --> 01:52:31,255
Hey!

855
01:52:47,476 --> 01:52:49,601
Nice shootin', Pap.

856
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:12,561
The 8th's movin' in.
We'd better check out the other side.

857
01:53:12,637 --> 01:53:14,729
Got it. You all right?

858
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:19,372
Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right.
We'll cover you with a 30.

859
01:53:19,445 --> 01:53:21,173
- On it.
- All right?

860
01:53:21,246 --> 01:53:23,405
OK, let's go!

861
01:53:23,682 --> 01:53:24,669
Move!

862
01:53:45,671 --> 01:53:47,900
Hjelmstad!

863
01:53:47,974 --> 01:53:50,305
- Help him up!
- Gunny!

864
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,869
Come on. Come on.

865
01:54:07,827 --> 01:54:10,624
- Christ.
- Joe! Joe!

866
01:54:12,932 --> 01:54:14,693
Tear him open.

867
01:54:15,670 --> 01:54:17,693
You want morphine?

868
01:54:17,772 --> 01:54:19,500
- You want morphine?
- Yeah.

869
01:54:23,744 --> 01:54:25,836
You'll be all right, sir.

870
01:54:29,417 --> 01:54:31,542
Goddamn it, Yahzee, get over here!

871
01:54:32,419 --> 01:54:33,816
Fuck!

872
01:54:34,655 --> 01:54:37,817
Chick... Stay with him.

873
01:54:40,295 --> 01:54:41,488
I got ya.

874
01:56:18,131 --> 01:56:20,325
I told you to stay with Gunny.

875
01:56:20,867 --> 01:56:22,766
Gunny's gone.

876
01:56:42,757 --> 01:56:45,815
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we, Joe?

877
01:56:47,329 --> 01:56:49,762
I'm runnin' out of ammo here, Joe.

878
01:56:53,567 --> 01:56:56,091
I don't wanna die in this shithole.

879
01:56:59,574 --> 01:57:01,733
You're not gonna die.

880
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:06,212
Nobody else is gonna die.

881
01:57:16,025 --> 01:57:20,595
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it out of here.

882
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,898
8th's caught out in the open.
We gotta call in the flyboys.

883
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:38,869
I'm gonna get that radio. Cover me.

884
01:59:08,377 --> 01:59:10,502
He got the radio, Yahzee!

885
01:59:41,778 --> 01:59:43,710
Cover me! I'm going!

886
01:59:47,183 --> 01:59:49,412
Stay back!

887
02:00:02,634 --> 02:00:04,224
Fuckers!

888
02:00:55,188 --> 02:00:57,655
It won't bring your friends back.

889
02:01:00,694 --> 02:01:02,923
What do you know about friends?

890
02:01:43,606 --> 02:01:45,869
Get us some air support!

891
02:01:59,822 --> 02:02:02,949
Bowie White, this is Carson Red, Arizona.

892
02:02:03,026 --> 02:02:05,357
I say again, Carson Red, Arizona.

893
02:02:12,101 --> 02:02:13,930
Coordinates!

894
02:02:14,004 --> 02:02:17,938
Two-twenty, Mike, three-six.

895
02:02:28,987 --> 02:02:30,976
All right, let's go.

896
02:02:32,491 --> 02:02:34,822
We're gonna make it outta here.

897
02:03:10,165 --> 02:03:12,154
Damn it, Joe.

898
02:03:15,138 --> 02:03:17,127
Just get it over with.

899
02:03:18,174 --> 02:03:20,163
Shut up, Ben.

900
02:03:39,697 --> 02:03:41,686
Do it, Joe.

901
02:03:43,068 --> 02:03:45,057
Do it!

902
02:03:47,806 --> 02:03:50,069
No one else is gonna die, Ben.

903
02:03:54,012 --> 02:03:55,807
No one else is dying.

904
02:05:23,305 --> 02:05:25,294
Joe, we did it.

905
02:05:26,876 --> 02:05:28,705
God...

906
02:05:29,612 --> 02:05:31,305
God!

907
02:05:31,947 --> 02:05:34,847
Oh, God... Oh, Joe...

908
02:05:50,034 --> 02:05:52,661
We saved a lot of marines today.

909
02:05:56,607 --> 02:05:58,699
Yeah, we did, Ben.

910
02:06:04,982 --> 02:06:06,881
Charlie...

911
02:06:07,219 --> 02:06:09,618
You know I didn't want to.

912
02:06:12,658 --> 02:06:14,453
Right?

913
02:06:25,671 --> 02:06:27,934
Hail... Hail Mary...

914
02:06:28,006 --> 02:06:29,666
full of grace...

915
02:06:29,742 --> 02:06:31,106
our...

916
02:06:31,778 --> 02:06:34,075
our Lord is with thee...

917
02:06:42,822 --> 02:06:45,984
Holy Mary, mother of God...

918
02:06:47,528 --> 02:06:49,517
pray for us...

919
02:06:58,105 --> 02:07:00,470
I got the last of 'em, Joe.

920
02:08:28,566 --> 02:08:30,829
His name was Joe Enders...

921
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:33,767
from South Philadelphia.

922
02:08:34,539 --> 02:08:36,664
He was a fierce warrior.

923
02:08:38,444 --> 02:08:40,433
A good marine.

924
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:53,656
If you ever tell a story about him,
George...

925
02:08:55,229 --> 02:08:57,458
say he was my friend.

926
02:09:29,397 --> 02:09:36,097
The Navajo Code was vital
in the victory at Saipan
and every major battle in the Pacific.

927
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:42,968
The Code was never broken.
