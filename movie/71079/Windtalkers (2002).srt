他们让我们守住这个阵地

73

乔

乔
Joe.

76
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,490
你没听见我说话吗?
Didn't hear a word, did you?

77
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,590
当男人和美女讲话时  经常会心不在焉的
That's what happens to a man when he's talking to a beautiful woman.

78
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,500
我们一直在观察着你  乔
It happens when you're not watching my lips, Joe.

79
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,070
看看这个
Watch this.

80
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,600
你现在一团糟  乔
You're a mess, Joe.

81
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,640
别自欺欺人了
You're not fooling anybody.

82
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,560
不  瑞塔
No, Rita.

83
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,410
他才是一团糟
He's a mess.

84
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,950
我每天都在康复
I'm getting better every day.

85
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,200
你耳膜穿孔  恩德斯
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.

86
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,100
所以才会失去平衡
Your equilibrium's all screwy.

87
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,080
你站都站不稳 怎么重回战场
You can't go back to war if you can't stand up.

88
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,230
走  士兵们  这场战争不会持续很久的  出发
Let's go, marines. This war ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.

89
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,880
乔
Joe.

90
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,880
为何不留下呢  乔?
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?

91
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,500
总有人会陪着你
Somebody's gotta keep the WAVES company.

92
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,930
你到底帮不帮我
Are you gonna help me or not?

93
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,220
明显的进步
Marked improvement.

94
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,530
他左耳的功能很好
And his left ear is the worse of the two?

95
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,030
真神奇
It's...amazing.

96
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,260
TBY和TBX必须分别表示
TBY hasn't got the range of the TBX.

97
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,580
你们必须回覆你解译的讯息给指挥部
So you may need a relay to get your transmission to command post.

98
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,330
在紧急状况下
But what it really comes down to...

99
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,250
要做到快速准确
is speed and accuracy under pressure.

100
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,840
翻译训练开始
Transcribe now.

101
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,080
胜利者  胜利者  我是X射线  完毕
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.

102
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,460
别忘了你们是在战场上
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!

103
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,890
队员不断的牺牲
We're losing men.

104
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,090
你们必须翻译这些语言

报告结束

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,710
新人的运气
Beginner's luck.

111
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,930
该你了
You're up, mac.

112
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,660
恩德斯下士报到  长官
Corporal Enders reporting, sir.

113
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,670
稍息
At ease.

114
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,790
在海军里表现不错
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.

115
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,950
然后是民间部队

116
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,120
盗窃并毁坏车辆

118
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:22,010
袭击殴打一名叫克斯比·奥多奴的神父
Assault and battery...on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

119
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,770
一名牧师?

120
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,110
是基南大主教高中的校长助理  长官
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan High School, sir.

121
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,980
同时也是教导主任
and head disciplinarian.

122
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,020
我也就读于公立学校
Public-school boy myself.

123
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,430
最小的问题是
Some minor problems in boot.

124
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,890
在上海有住所
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.

125
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,750
那你可以帮忙解决问题了
And you made a hell of a stand on the Solomons.

126
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,300
日子不好过吧
Tough bit of business there, huh?

127
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,980
很艰难
Pretty tough, sir.

128
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,020
你还准备再投入那样的生活吗
But you're prepared to jump right back into it?

129
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,250
是的  非常乐意
Yes, sir. Very much so.

130
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,340
非常乐意
Very much so.

131
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,060
那么 
Well...

132
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,330
日本鬼子完全破译了我们现有的密码
The Japs have pretty much busted every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.

133
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,860
你们在所罗门遇袭就是因为他们破译了密码
You men on the Solomons were lost to a broken code.

134
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,750
告诉我
Tell me something.

135
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,460
你在所罗门遇到过印第安人吗?
You ever run into any Indians on the Solomons?

136
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,000
印弟安人吗
Indians, sir?

137
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,850
不  正确来说是纳瓦霍人
Navajo, to be exact.

138
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,700
科尔研究了一种新的密码
The Corps has developed a new code...

139
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,000
是建立在他们语言的基础上
based on their language.

140
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,700
确实有效
It's had quite an impact.

141
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,400
这种东西需要保护
So much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it.

142
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,440
这也是你在这里的原因
That's why you're here.

143
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,160
你要使我们的重要人物安全
You're to pair with one of them, keep his ass safe.

144
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,320
你的工作就是保护他
Your job is to keep him alive...

145
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,570
以便他能专心工作
so he can do his job.

146
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,990
请原谅  我觉得我应该做杀鬼子的工作
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,

147
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,970
而不是去当谁的保姆
not baby-sitting some Indian.

148
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,730
我们把你从名单中选出来
Enders, we didn't pick your name out of a hat.

149
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,590
因为我们需要好的海军陆战队员
We need good marines.

150
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,740
这是你在这里的原因
That's why you're standing here.

151
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,140
看一看
Take a look.

152
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,540
这是一个纳瓦霍人  曾经是
It's a Navajo. Or it was.

153
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,080
被鬼子抓获拷打致死
Tortured to death by Japanese intelligence trying to bust our code.

154
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,940
幸运的是
Fortunately...

155
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,360
他即使想帮也无从帮起
he couldn't help them even if he wanted to.

156
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,830
-长官? -他只是一个纳瓦霍人  而不是解译员
-Sir? -Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.

157
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,910
密码虽然基于他们的语言 
Code's based on their language...

158
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,890
但仍需要经过培训
but it is still a code.

159
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,850
日本人就是想要抓个活的
Tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one.

160
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,970
让我来告诉你
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal,

161
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,890
不管在任何情况下
cannot leave this room.

162
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:31,390
解译员不能被敌人活捉
Under no circumstances can you allow your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.

163
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,460
你的任务
Your mission...

164
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,810
就是保护密码
is to protect the code...

165
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,400
不惜一切代价
at all costs.

166
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,390
你明白了吗?
You understand me?

167
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,500
是的  我了解
Yes, sir, I do.

168
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,660
好
Good.

169
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,380
恭喜你
Congratulations.

170
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,950
你刚刚升为中士了
You just made sergeant.

171
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,160
换你接手
Fortino, take over.

172
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,570
你就是那个在少校办公室的人吧?
Hey...That was you, right, sitting in front of the major's office?

173
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,130
我是彼得·亨得森
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.

174
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,260
他们叫我"公牛"  不是因为我四肢发达或什么的
They call me Ox. Not cos of my big muscles or anything.

175
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,500
因为我来自加州的公牛镇  就在好莱坞北面
I'm from Oxnard, California. Just north of Hollywood a ways.

176
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,670
你也参加贾斯科行动是吗?
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

177
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,880
请问第二侦察连在哪里?
Hey, know where we might find 2nd Joint Assault Signal?

178
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,350
不他妈知道  伙计
No fuckin' idea, mac.

179
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,130
谢谢 谢谢你的"美言"
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

180
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,320
我从未见过这么多白种人

181
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,910
我想他们也从未见过 这么多纳瓦霍人
They've never seen so many Navajo.

182
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,370
看来你好象在战场上伤的不轻
Looks to me like you got to see a little action there.

183
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,620
我也是
Me too.

184
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,470
狗日的小日本正好打中我的屁股
Jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass.

185
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,470
简直不可思议  我当时又没有向后逃跑
You believe that shit? I wasn't running or nothin'.

186
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,180
你在贾斯科行动中的任务 
So, your duty with JASCO

187
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,260
和那些纳瓦霍通讯员有关吗
have anything to do with these Navajo radiomen?

188
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,900
无可奉告
I'm not at liberty to say.

189
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,410
看你那新的臂章  和我的一样
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.

190
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,020
看来你要保守的秘密
So I'm guessing the orders

191
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,560
和我要保守的秘密是一样的
you can't tell me are the same orders I can't tell you.

192
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,620
这都什么玩意儿啊?
Hell of a thing, huh?

193
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,860
不要随便乱说  中士  这是军队
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant. It's the marines.

194
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,950
好
Yeah.

195
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,410
他们看起来也没什么特别的
They look pretty normal, I guess.

196
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,850
以为他们会涂上迷彩吗
Expecting them to wear war paint?

197
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,480
也许我们要介绍一下自己
Maybe we ought to go introduce ourselves.

198
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,370
他们看来好象迷路了
They look a little lost to me.

199
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,310
亨得森
Henderson.

200
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,940
我是不会跟他们太亲近的
I wouldn't get too friendly.

201
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,490
你好
How!

202
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,990
开个玩笑  我是公牛
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.

203
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,450
白马
Whitehorse.

204
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,430
他叫亚奇  本
This is Yahzee. Ben.

205
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,370
-下一个  -太棒了 太棒了
-Next. -Beautiful. Beautiful.

206
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,230
闭上眼睛吃就会觉得美味了
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.

207
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,030
下一个
Who's next?

208
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,230
介意我和你一起吗?
Mind if I join you?

209
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,250
我叫本 亚奇
I'm Ben Yahzee.

210
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,110
好像上级让我们俩搭档
Guess the Corps paired us up.

211
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,310
你好吗?
How you doin'?

212
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,090
你挡住我视线了
You're blocking my view.

213
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,890
对不起
Oh, sorry.

214
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,930
他们把这玩意儿叫什么
What do they call this crap anyway?

215
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,420
士兵们叫它狗屎
Marines call it chow.

216
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,010
看起来真难吃
Well, there's a propaganda effort.

217
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,220
对不起
Sorry.

218
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,190
你喝我的吧
You can have mine.

219
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,770
惨了
Shit.

220
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,840
你说你叫什么名字
What'd you say your name was again, Private?

221
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,460
亚奇  本·亚奇
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.

222
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,700
拿住这个
Hold this.

223
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,220
可恶
Shit.

224
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,170
你的白人兄弟怎么样

225
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,120
他很饿

226
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,040
再来一对
I'm in for a couple more.

227
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,000
写给你儿子吗

228
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,410
代我向他问候
Tell him I say hello.

229
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,860
小牌  看我怎么吃掉
Pair of cowboys for Big E.

230
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,470
该轮到格里克了
Possible straight for the Greek.

231
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,290
该翻格里克的底牌了
Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.

232
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
这家伙有一对二耶  看来不错
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid. Lookin' good.

233
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,930
不会吧
Oh, come on!

234
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,510
现在大举进攻
Now there's a bold move.

235
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,890
好吧
All right.

236
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,360
好  现在什么情况
OK...Oh, another mess for the Sunshine State.

237
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,600
什么?  你对我不满?
What, are you mad at me?

238
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,050
只是想赢你的钱
Just want your money.

239
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,110
你们看
Hey! Look at that.

240
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,700
三条九  漂亮
A trio of nines. Pretty.

241
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,010
你要下注吗?
You shuffle that deck?

242
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,950
当然
I certainly did.

243
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,390
我加两个筹码压九
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.

244
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,590
我跟

245
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,890
翻开底牌
We all got thumbs up our asses.

246
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,130
你们知道吗
You won't for much longer.

247
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,470
有人告诉我下星期我们要动身了
I got a buddy in Intel that says we ship out in a week.

248
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,910
他们说下个星期说了一个月了
I been hearing "next week" for a month.

249
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,180
哈利  我不知道你认识什么消息灵通的人
I didn't know you knew anybody in Intelligence, Harri.

250
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,750
明年我就退伍了
Next year'd be all right with me.

251
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,940
先生们注意了
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep. Look at that.

252
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,070
三条九带双四
Nines and fours.

253
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,690
宝贝  全吃了
Full boat, baby.

254
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,660
三条K带皇后  你们全挂了
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.

255
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,670
天呀
Oh, Jesus!

256
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,680
妈的  我不玩了
Fuck it. I'm out.

257
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,020
我也要去给老婆写信了
Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.

258
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,630
老天才知道会发生什么事
God knows what a girl will do without reassurance.

259
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,700
兔崽子
Son of a bitch.

260
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,100
我们还有两个位子  你们来一起玩吗?
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats opening up. You wanna come join us?

261
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,050
你说真的吗?
Are you serious?

262
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,650
印第安牌手吗?
What, Injun poker?

263
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,590
你们真的会玩吗?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?

264
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,460
打牌没这么容易
Card on the head,

265
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,210
你们玩不了
only fool can't see it is you.

266
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,330
你们想过来玩吗?
You want to come on over, or what?

267
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,490
我来玩
Cut me in.

268
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,830
好吧
All right.

269
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,260
带两可以
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low, hoggers OK,

270
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,300
四带一也行
ace plays both ways...

271
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,310
别让他没吓着你
Hey, don't let him scare you.

272
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,280
玩牌的要诀是
If you've ever played a high-low game,

273
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,840
舍得花时间和金钱
it's like any other. Waste of time and money.

274
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,010
你下什么注?
Well, ante up...

275
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,380
酋长?
Chief?

276
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,510
你怎么知道我是酋长?
How'd you know I was a chief?

277
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,900
你又没看过我戴着帽子洗澡
You must've seen me showering with my war bonnet.

278
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,810
快下注  快下注 Deal 'em up   deal 'em up.

279
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,480
要知道  我们不收贝壳哦
 -You know, we don't take wampum here.

280
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,990
真好听
Beautiful.

281
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,780
好吧
All right, then.

282
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,930
终于下达命令了
Orders finally came through.

283
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,970
我们明天早上坐船出发
We ship out tomorrow morning.

284
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,310
目的地 塞班岛
Destination: the island of Saipan,

285
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,810
是我们远航到东京的第一站
which is one of the stepping stones we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.

286
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,020
占领这个岛是很重要的
It's of strategic importance that we capture this island.

287
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,540
我们将它作为前沿海军基地
We can get ourselves an advanced naval base

288
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,180
以供B-29轰炸机停靠补给
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's

289
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,790
然后轰炸范围可达东京

290
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,750
目前塞班岛是日本领土
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil,

291
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,610
有三万人居住
and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.

292
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,070
他们定会和我们争夺寸土寸金
They're gonna fight for every square inch,

293
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,330
因为那是他们的家
because it's their home,

294
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,220
而我们要将他们赶走
but we're gonna take it away from 'em!

295
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,540
杀掉日本鬼子
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!

296
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,040
我们是这个师的先遣队
We're gonna be in front of the whole damn division.

297
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,550
我们将成为他们眼睛和耳朵

298

找出敌军位置

299
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,110
给舰艇火炮提供精确坐标
coordinating the naval gunfire

300
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,980
四个月来  我们正是为此接受训练
exactly what we've been training to do for the last four months.

301
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,170
明白吗?
All right?

302
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,640

309
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,630
如果我正确理解命令的话
who, if I'm understanding these orders correctly,

310
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,760
他们将保护好我们纳瓦霍伙伴的屁股
will be covering our Navajos' asses.

311
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,660
去你的  乔 恩德斯
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

312

我要告诉你们
..but I'm tellin' you,

313
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,940
我们将要踏上敌人的土地
we'll be steppin' into our share of the shit nonetheless.

314
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,750
还有问题吗?
Any questions?

315
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,910
恩德斯
Enders.

316
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,140
听上去好像奄奄一息了
Sounds like you're dying.

317
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,460
这能帮助你止吐
These might help get rid of the taste.

318
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,570
查理和我在圣地牙哥搭船时晕船
Charlie and I, we both lost it on the boat ride from San Diego.

319
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,660
在亚利桑那遗失了过多水分

320
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,120

323
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,740
只是想帮你
Just trying to help.

324
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,150
我不是问你这个
Not what I meant.

325
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,600
你是问我来这参军为了什么?
You mean what am I doing in this uniform?

326
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,460
这也是我的战争
It's my war too, Sergeant.

327
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,270
我为我的国家
I'm fighting for my country...

328
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,520
为我的土地和同胞而战
for my land, for my people.

329
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,810
我才不在乎你的同胞
Not your people I'm worried about.

330
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,500
听着恩德斯
Listen, Enders,

331
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,380
我是解译员
I'm a codetalker.

332
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,250
我要在2分半钟内做完以前要一个小时才能做完的
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes to do what used to take an hour.

333
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,950
有人说的比你现在说的还要过分
Now, somebody wearing a lot more stripes than you

334
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,970
认为我是为了得到些什么
thinks that's worth something.

335
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,050
当子弹从你头顶飞过时  提醒我记一下
Remind me to time you when you got bullets flying over your head.

336
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,990
你究竟是怎么了?
What the hell's wrong with you?

337
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,580
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

338
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,620
Shave his belly with a rusty razor Early in the morning!

339
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,630

To the shores of Tripoli

341
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,350
We will fight our country's battles

342
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,350
On the land and on the sea

343
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,730
First to fight for right and freedom

344
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,700
And to keep our honor clean

345
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,820
We are proud to claim the title

346
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,030
Of United States Marines

347
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,390
你耳朵好点了吗?
How's that ear?

348
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,450
虽然你不承认耳朵有问题
Not that you'd ever admit it,

349
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,120
但吃几颗药会好过点
but if it starts aching, take a couple of those.

350
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,330
明早给我打个电话
And call me in the morning.

351
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,390
你不是明早就要启程了?

356
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,510
你爱喝什么
What's your poison?

357
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,170
还是来点比较烈的好了
Jeez, might as well go all out.

358

I'll cover you. Smoke and cover.

433
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,360
我可以做到的
I can do this.

434
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,870
我可以做到的
I can do this.

435
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,710
烟雾弹
Smoke 'em up!

436
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:07,660
那里
There.

437
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,010
掩护他
Cover up.

438
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,770
爽
Shit!

439
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,700
爽  他妈的日本队达阵
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!

440
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,640
前进大约0500

441
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:31,740
到时会有替换人员及弹药补给  完毕

442
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,180
收到  确保他们有新的密码

443
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,310
[风」回答 [语者」

444
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,630
这是我们兄弟称呼我们的方式

445
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,110
你说怎么样  完毕

446
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,200
[风语者」  我挺喜欢

447
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,400
好的  凯莫 赛比今晚小心行事  完毕

448
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,640
你怎么可以把干粮吃完
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?

449
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,500
王八蛋  你在发什么牢骚呀
You are a whiny son of a bitch right now, aren't you?

450
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,840
在丛林里呆上2200小时  这在东海岸怎么可能做到?
2200 hours in jungle hell -what does that make it on the East Coast?

451
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,340
我怎么他妈知道?
How the fucking hell should I know?

452
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,750
现在才七点
Just seven...

453
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,180
星期天早上八点了
It's 8am, Sunday morning.

454
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,430
希望我的床在礼拜六晚上不会被其他男人占据
I hope my side of the bed didn't get taken up Saturday night.

455
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,000
内尔  你怕自己戴了绿帽  你在担心她吧
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer, you keep worrying about her.

456
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,730
也许我回到罗得岛就被戴了绿帽
Might get my ass sent back to Rhody, though.

457
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,040
内尔  罗得岛上还有很多女人呀
There's plenty of dollies outside of Rhode Island, Nell.

458
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,670
很多喔
Many plenty.

459
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,330
一点也不像这个鸟地方
Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.

460
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,560
但愿不是真的
Ain't that the truth.

461
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:28,840
罗得岛上的女孩
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.

462
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,770
常去戴脱那海滩
The most beautiful women...

463
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,990
漂亮马子多
in the world.

464
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,100
在战争之前
This one time,

465
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,400
有一次
before the war,

466
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,340
我躺在沙滩上
I'm lyin' on the beach...

467
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,760
有个可爱的家伙  叫莫莉
and this sweet little thing named Molly...

468
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,440
从水边一直向我走来
comes out the water.She walks straight up to me...

469
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,000
问我是不是饿了
and asks me if I'm hungry...

470
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,520
因为她有根小香肠
cos she's havin' a weenie roast.

471
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,540
放屁
Shit! Damn.

472
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,220
没错  她是男的
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.

473
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,470
我现在全身上下只剩下Zippo打火机
Now I'm on Saipan with this giant Zippo strapped to my back

474
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,980
我常这么嘲笑自己
and I'm roastin' human beings.

475
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,970
我为什么自愿从军
Why I volunteered...

476
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,500
因为我孑然一生
beyond me.

477
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,050
我为自己在这里而自豪
Damn, I'm proud to be here.

478
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,700
我全家都参军了
My whole family's been in the Corps.

479
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,760
我家老头子被判无期徒刑
My old man, he's a lifer.

480
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,250
无论在哪里
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.

481
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,310
甚至在家乡都让人看不起
Around the house too.

482
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,980
也许现在他被释放了
Maybe now he'll back off.

483
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:46,700
帕帕斯  我 
Pappas, I...

484
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,720
我想请你帮我个忙
I want you to do me a favor.

485
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,440
万一我有个三长两短
If anything should happen to me,

486
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,150
把这个给我妻子
you make sure that my wife gets this.

487
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,130
确保她拿到手
I mean, she picked them out and all.

488
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,040
别说这些  内尔
Don't talk like that, Nell.

489
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:10,120
不要开这种玩笑
You don't even joke about shit like that.

490
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,550
把戒指戴上  你能回家的
Now you put that ring back on. You're goin' home.

491
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:54,150
(印地安语)

492
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,290
尝尝这个
Don't thank me till you've tried it.

493
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,610
这是你掉的信
You missed mail call.

494
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,090
他们在干什么?
What the hell are they doin'?

495
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,580
我也不知道
I don't know.

496
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,530
从太阳下山就开始了
They've been doin' it since sundown.

497
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,810
像是祈福的一种吧
Sounds like some kind of prayer.

498
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,660
也许他们知道我们的任务
Maybe they know our orders.

499
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,240
你下得了手吗  乔?
Think you could do it, Joe?

500
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,520
结束这个话题  亨德森
Give it a rest, Henderson.

501
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,470
结束话题?  我试着不去谈  可是 
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...

502
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,670
我是来杀鬼子的  不是自己人
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.

503
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,470
亚奇  你是个勇士

504
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,270
你的家人将以你为荣

505
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,250
小子  你在这儿干什么?
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

506
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,720
拿我的军服
Getting on my uniform.

507
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:26,290
亚奇  你知道你和日本人有什么区别吗?
You know the difference between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

508
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,200
制服上的区别
It's that uniform.

509
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,500
就这样
That's it.

510
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,610
我了解你们
See, I know you people.

511
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,770
我知道你们这种人有多野蛮  小子
I know what kind of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.

512
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,410
单独一个在这儿可得小心
You ought to be careful out here all alone.

513
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,180
没人会保护你
No baby-sitter.

514
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,390
我也许会把你当作日本人
I might just take you for a Jap.

515
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,380
奇克  总得让我穿上衣服吧
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

516
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,810
还是你还要继续你这个无聊的举动
Or keep demonstrating what an ignorant fool you are?

517
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,700
无聊的举动那又怎么样
How's that for an ignorant fool?

518
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,250
再来啊
Go ahead, try again.

519
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,940
你想干嘛?
You gonna do somethin'?

520
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,150
奇克  住手
Chick! Come on!

521
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,220
闪开
Get off me!

522
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:23,790
你没事吧  本?
You OK, Ben?

523
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:24,750
嗯!
Yeah.

524
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,730
本?  妈的
Ben? Shit.

525
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,770
我还以为他是日本人  陆战队员都会穿制服
I thought he was a Jap. You know, killed some marine for that uniform.

526
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,880
当然了  奇克
Sure you did, Chick.

527
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,840
这个他妈的印地安人  看起来像日本人
Damn Injun looks just like a Jap, don't he?

528
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,500
我不是他妈的印地安人
Look, I'm no damn Injun.

529
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,140
我是塔房部落
I'm Navajo...

530
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,430
苦水族的纳瓦霍人
of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.

531
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,360
不过你确实长得像小日本
But you do look like a Nip.

532
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,290
下次你要洗澡事先告知我
Next time you decide to take a bath, Private, let me know,

533
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,140
不然我就踹你屁股
or I'll kick your ass.

534
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,620
混帐东西
Fuckin' shitbird.

535
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,400
什么时候了  还像个娘们
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter all the time, I thought.

536
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,730
在这里勾心斗角
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.

537
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,310
昨晚他们那个仪式
That ceremony you saw last night?

538
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,530
叫做辟邪仪式
It's called a protection ceremony.

539
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:23,500
纳瓦霍人相信  在人快死前
Navajo believe, until a body's given a proper burial,

540
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,940
恶灵也就是我们所称的魔鬼
the spirits stay near it.

541
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,570
会围绕在身边
Chindis -that's what we call evil spirits. Demons.

542
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,960
我从小就不把这当回事
I haven't thought much about it since I was a kid.

543
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,000
直到我看到那些尸体
Till I saw those dead bodies.

544
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,720
你想说你看到鬼魂了?
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

545
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,170
不  中士  我是说我不会再发愣了
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you I won't freeze up again.

546
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,020
因为你的伙伴在你的前额涂上灰烬
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?

547
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,330
没错
That's right

548
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,820
因为我的伙伴在我的前额涂上灰烬
Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead.

549
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,190
你见过鬼魂吗?
You ever see ghosts?

550
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,790
别再问这样愚蠢的问题了
No more stupid questions today, Private.

551
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,640
这是命令
That's an order.

552
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:42,990
很美的音乐
Sounds beautiful.

553
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,620
你是自学的吗?
You, uh, you self-taught?

554
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,070
我父亲教的
My dad was always playing.

555
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,420
你知道他们说什么吗?
You know what they say:

556
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,770
说你吹不赢他们的
if you can't beat 'em...

557
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,650
胡说
No shit.

558
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,100
我父亲给了我这个东西
My dad, he...he gave me this thing.

559
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,030
说是口琴
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.

560
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,640
当我吹奏它的时候我总觉得很单调
Used to bring 'em in for feeding with this little tune I played.

561
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,850
可是我又不能向你借笛子吹  那么 
I know I ain't gonna get you to quit playin' that thing, so...

562
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,640
不如我替你伴奏吧
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...

563
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,560
我想没什么用吧
I don't think it's gonna work.

564
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,470
反正我们也没什么事做  不如就来试看看  怎样?
Well, we ain't got much else to do out here.

565
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,700
怎样?
What the hell?

566
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,360
好吧
OK.

567
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,280
你吹旋律
All right, you lead off.

568
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,470
我跟着你
I'll follow you.

569
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,830
第二侦察连在0600位置出发

570
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,060
沿190约克附近04公路进行侦察任务

571
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,650
在树林西北方 可能会遭遇轻微抵抗  完毕

572
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,360
收到  轻微是什么意思?

573
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,630
没有抵抗是轻微的  完毕

574
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:21,330
记住   我们的任务不是问个不停

575
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,750
而是照做或战死  完毕

576
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:38,200
亲爱的乔  你好吗?
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

577
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,910
你不爱写信  我也不期望你会回
Or, given that you're not much of a writer, should I not expect an answer?

578
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,490
报纸说我们的士兵很英勇
The newspapers say our boys are doing great.

579
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:50,480
可能记者没有去卡内奥赫湾海军医院看过
But I don't think the reporters have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.

580
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,110
我最近在怀基基海滩发现一只流浪狗
I found a stray dog the other day on Waikiki.

581
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,410
我收留了它并给它洗澡
I gave him a bath and took him in.

582
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,960
它让我想起了你  很可爱
He reminded me of you -but cuter.

583
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,840
多亏有它在寒风中给我温暖
At least he keeps me warm at night.

584
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,560
我试着不去想你
I try not to think about you.

585
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,850
和那里会发生的事
About what might be happening over there.

586
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:15,130
但有时我躺在床上
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,

587
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:18,130
不自觉的会想你在哪里
I can't keep myself from wondering where you are.

588
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,870
在做什么
How you're doing.

589
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,480
你在干什么
What the hell you doin'?

590
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,820
给我儿子写信
Writing a letter to my son.

591
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,590
没听到命令吗
Forget your orders?

592
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,180
不能送信出去
No letters out.

593
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,270
邮递不通
Command don't want postmarks going to the reservation.

594
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,660
嘿!你没听见吗?
Hey! You hear me?

595
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,600
我打算回家后再给他看
I thought that he might read 'em when I get home.

596
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:04,980
你儿子
What's his name?

597
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,370
叫什么?
Your son.

598
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:12,120
乔治  乔治 华盛顿
It's George. George Washington.

599
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,140
乔治 华盛顿 亚奇
George Washington Yahzee.

600
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,260
他长大后应该会很有成就
It's got a bit of a ring to it.

601
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,000
我太太可不这么想
My wife wasn't so sure.

602
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,550
她有点传统
She's a little more traditional.

603
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,100
-感觉很和睦的家庭　　-亚奇  也让我们看看
-Nice-looking family. -Let's see, Yahz.

604
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,640
这就是乔治  他很有个性
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.

605
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,580
他自己有主见
He's got a mind of his own.

606
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:41,100
我可以抽一根吗?
Can I try one of those?

607
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,480
你抽烟?
You smoke?

608
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:44,970
不怎么抽
Not really.

609
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,720
-下车  -快下车
-Dismount! -Get out of the truck!

610
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,720
快
Let's go! Let's go!

611
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,280
跟我来
Follow me!

612
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,670
快走
Let's go!

613
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,370
我中弹了
I'm hit!

614
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,530
亚奇
Yahzee!

615
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,710
亚奇
Yahzee!

616
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,380
我中弹了
I'm hit!

617
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,790
它烧起来了  脱下它
Take it off! It burns!

618
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:58,980
你没受伤  闭嘴  你没事
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit.

619
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,420
散开
Spread out!

620
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:18,460
快走
Move!

621
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,000
趴下
Get down.

622
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,090
他们从哪里来的?
Where the hell are they comin' from?

623
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,440
从我们那里
From us.

624
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:31,990
什么
What?

625
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,080
这不是日本大炮
They're not Jap guns.

626
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,460
我们被友军误袭?
We're getting shot at by our own guys?

627
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:38,380
我们应该在04公路的
We're supposed to be on road 04.

628
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,280
-打开无线电  -不行
-Get the regiment on the horn. -I can't!

629
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,930
告诉总部我们被 
Tell 'em they're shelling...

630
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,890
不行  无线电被打坏了
I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.

631
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,470
-火力太密集了  -鬼子们应该就在我们前面
-They're firing too short! -The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.

632
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:51,090
做点什么吧
Do somethin'.

633
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,660
可恶  跟我来
Shit...Follow me!

634
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,780
-我们走错路了  -他妈的
-We're on the wrong fuckin' road! -Goddamn it!

635
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,360
天哪
God.

636
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,940
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

637
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,820
我来救你  伙计

641
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,890
内里
Nellie!

642
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,590
医护兵
Corpsman!

643
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,370
乔 你说得对
You were right, Joe.

644
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,480
我真的跟他们长得很像
I do look like a Nip.

645
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:12,090
你什么意思?
What the hell are you talking about?

646
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,610
穿日本军服混进去  
Putting on that Jap uniform

647
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:17,380
去抢一台无线电来请求火力支援
Trying to get one of their radios, call off our guns.

648
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,030
太蠢了
That's stupid.

649
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,880
闭嘴  让他说
Shut up. Let him talk.

650
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:20,930
我不会让他去的
He's not goin' out there.

651
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,110
你不是指挥  恩德斯
You're not in charge here, Enders.

652
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,200
我接到命令  他归我管
I got orders, Gunny. He's my responsibility!

653
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,160
他只是个孩子
He's just a kid!

654
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,090
你们杀了自己人!
You killed your own!

655
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,830
你们是怎么回事!
What's wrong with you?

656
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,980
你们杀了自己人!
You killed your own!

657
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,660
王八蛋!
Sons of bitches!You killed your own!

658
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,830
你们杀了自己人!
Sons of bitches!

659
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,640
你确定要做吗
Sure you're up to this?

660
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:00,500
尽快完成任务  长官
Find out soon enough, sir.

661
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,290
你在干什么
What the hell are you doin' there?

662
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,420
我跟他一起去
I'm goin' with him.

663
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,380
你没意见吧
If that's OK with you.

664
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,600
枪给我
Give me the rifle.

665
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,910
Horyo-da.(日语战俘的叫法)

666
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,450
是日语中战俘的意思
It's Jap for prisoner.

667
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,480
大家准备好
All right, everybody be ready.

668
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:47,990
冲啊!
Now!

669
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,610
打我  打我
Hit me. Hit me.

670
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,810
饶了我吧
Please don't hit me!

671
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,850

我是红卡逊
this is Carson Red!

677
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:45,600
停火  停火  打到自己人了
Cease fire! Cease fire! You're shelling marines!

678
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:48,110
中士
Sergeant!

679
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,590
停火  停火

680
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,020
325　543  攻击这方位
Add 325, fire for effect!

681

调整方位　325　攻击这方位
Redirect fire. Add 325, fire for effect.

682

683
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,600
升高  快点  开火
Crank it up! Let's go!

684
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:11,390
准备
Commence fire!

685
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,640
开火
Fire!

686
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,690
太好了
Yeah!

687
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,690
真不赖
Well, I'll be.

688
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,730
上校  有什么能帮你的吗?
Colonel. Can I help you, sir?

689
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:55,760
我在找我们的一个中士  恩德斯  约瑟夫·恩德斯
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders. Joseph F Enders.

690
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,110
恩德斯
Enders.

691
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,610
在  长官
Yes, sir.

692
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,840
报告说你越权指挥上级
Report I read claims you went above and beyond.

693
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,410
怎么?
Sir?

694
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,130
对你的英勇事迹  我们还是认为应该奖励
You've been recommended for commendation.

695
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,880
不过我注意了一下
And I concur.

696
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,740
没看到适合授勋的地方
But I don't see any point in you having to wait around

697
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,390
那我们就不要拘泥于形式
for all those formalities to work themselves out.

698
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,620
让我亲自为你戴上吧
Not when I got one of these handy.

699
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:32,090
恭喜你
Congratulations, Enders.

700
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,530
你救了很多战友
You saved a lot of marines.

701
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,000
长官  非我一人  
I wasn't alone in that, sir.

702
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,280
没有本 亚吉  我无法成功
I couldn't have done it without Private Ben Yahzee.

703
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:50,150
是吗
Oh...Right.

704
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,000
印第安人
The, uh, Indian.

705
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:57,040
上校  请原谅  他是塔房部落
Begging the colonel's pardon, he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,

706
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:00,950
苦水族的纳瓦霍人
born for the Towering House clan.

707
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,050
当然  塔房部落
Of course. Navajo.

708
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:07,490
纳瓦霍人
Towering House clan.

709
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,860
继续努力  恩德斯
You keep up the good work, Enders.

710
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,390
把它交给内里的太太
Send that to Nellie's wife.

711
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,670
恩德斯   这是你的信吗?
You ever not miss mail call, Enders?

712
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,650
我妈说如果有人花时间精力写信给你
My mom says somebody takes the time to write a letter,

713
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:51,400
你应该要看
you should read the letter.

714
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,080
你母亲让你喝酒吗?
Does she let you drink, your mother?

715
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,550
不
No.

716
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,960
不过她不在这里
But she's not here.

717
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,470
这是什么?
What is it?

718
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,290
不是基安蒂红酒  告诉你
Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that.

719
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,650
这是米酒   虽然是日本酒  不过味道不错
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake. But it does the trick.

720
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,560
你到底有多少这个鬼东西!
How much of this crap do you have anyway?

721
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,320
乔  你那只耳朵是不是听不到?
You have a little trouble with that ear, don't you, Joe?

722
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:38,860
是内耳  我耳里的砧骨和镫骨已破损
Ah, real problem's the inner ear. It's anvils and stirrups and shit.

723
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,710
还没办法保持平衡呢!
I'm a little out of balance.

724
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:48,950
你今天表现的很好  亚奇
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee.

725
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,800
是啊  我做到了  不是吗?
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

726
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,480
我敢说我让你刮目相看了
I bet I surprised the shit out of you.

727
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,250
乔  你也做了一件伟大的事
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe.

728
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:05,740
你把勋章给了内里的妻子
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife.

729
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,160
我才不管勋章不勋章
I don't give a shit about medals.

730
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:20,100
我得到第一枚勋章时
The first one they gave me...

731
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,190
我把它丢到海里
I threw it into the ocean.

732
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,440
你为何这么做呢?
What'd you get that one for?

733
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,490
只有我没死
For not dyin'.

734
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:36,300
跟我出生入死的15名弟兄也有
The 15 men who fought with me got decorated too.

735
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,730
全牺牲了  所以
For dying. So...

736
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,430
上尉出发前晚被杀了  而且
Lieutenant was killed the night before and...

737
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:53,800
没有其他人愿意接手  所以 
none of the sergeants even made it out of the landing craft, so...

738
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,810
我留下负责  那是我第一次指挥
that left me in charge. It was my first command.

739
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:08,620
任务是守住沼泽  可是又没有任何后援
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.

740
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,170
我做到了
And I did.

741
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:20,270
在我指挥下的
All of the men under my command...

742
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,200
期盼我的
men who trusted me...

743
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,480
求我撤退的所有弟兄
who begged me to pull back...

744
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,260
却没人能活下来
not one of them made it.

745
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:50,270
只因为一个愚蠢的混蛋
Just one stupid asshole.

746
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:59,190
就这样  给了我银星勋章
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.

747
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,350
他们叫什么名字?
What were their names?

748
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:07,990
也许我可以把故事讲给后代听
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.

749
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,670
关于他们的
You know, who they were...

750
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,370
点点滴滴
and what they were like.

751
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:17,530
究竟这事有什么魔力让你这个纳瓦霍人想去知道
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit. What the hell for?

752
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,420
去悼念他们
To honor them.

753
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,850
(印地安语)

754
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,740
他们的精神
Their memory.

755
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:27,580
这不是你的错  乔
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe.

756
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,190
你不过是奉命行事罢了
You were just followin' orders.

757
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:31,840
是的
Yeah.

758
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,120
我是个他妈的好军人
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

759
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,780
所以我有勋章
That's why they gave me this detail.

760
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,670
没错
Yeah.

761
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,740
我真是个他妈的好军人
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

762
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:16,400
乔
Joe

763
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,520
-乔  -干吗?
-Joe! -What?

764
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,650
却你的  乔 恩德斯
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

765
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:30,310
确实是
Really.

766
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,670
没事的
It's all right.

767
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,770
振作点  乔
Come on, Joe.

768
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,660
我扶你
I got you.

769
01:22:53,740 --> 01:23:02,720
(印地安语)

770
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,510
什么玩意儿?
What the fuck?

771
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,840
我没醉  把烟掐了
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee. You cut that horseshit out.

772
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:02,380
你们预期还有多远能抵达村庄? 完毕

773
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,110
大约1500

774
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,350
空中侦察回报没动静  应该很安全

775
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,990
可能的话需要提供干粮和信件  完毕

776
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:14,300
我把我爸的混合了瑞典调合物的草莓称为酸奶
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in this Swedish concoction called yoghurt.

777
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,800
天哪  美国将诞生一种新口味
God willin', America will develop the taste.

778
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,830
那你呢  查理  战争过后你想过怎样的生活?
What about you, Charlie? What's life got in store for you after this mess?

779
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:22,680
牧羊
Sheep.

780
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,760
什么牧羊?
Sheep?

781
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,260
就像奇克的女朋友  绵羊
As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?

782
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,260
查理家里拥有我们那片地区最大的羊群
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock in the Four Corners area.

783
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:33,640
真的假的?
No shit?

784
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:37,020
-白马  你是个有钱人吧?  -将就吧
-You a rich man, Whitehorse? -We do OK.

785
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,650
是呀
Taxis.

786
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,280
等我离开这个烂队  我就要成为百万富翁
A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em. That's how I'm making my millions.

787
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:46,770
然后回到故乡去
And then I'm goin' back to the motherland.

788
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:50,370
我要在圣托里尼的峭壁边  盖一栋别墅
I'm gonna build myself a villa on the cliffs of Santorini.

789
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:51,730
啊  圣托里尼  我的朋友
Ah, Santorini, my friends

790
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,180
那才是享受
that's living.

791
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,870
听起来不错
Sounds nice.

792
01:24:56,710 --> 01:24:58,170
亚奇  那你呢?
What about you, Zee?

793
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,890
我想去教书
Thinkin' about teaching.

794
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,860
教书
Ah, teaching.

795
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,070
回报社会?
Bring a little something back to the reservation?

796
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:05,470
实际上
Actually,

797
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,010
其实兴趣是想回报这个世界
more interested in bringing some of the reservation back to the world.

798
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,280
希望能在大学教书
Hoping to teach college.

799
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,760
教美国的历史
American history.

800
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,490
这正是我们需要的
Oh, that's just what we need.

801
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,880
亚奇教大学生
Yahzee teachin' college boys...

802
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,460
我不知道那会是什么情形
about Custer's scalpin' at Little Bighorn.

803
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:22,160
那么卡森呢?
And what about Kit Carson,

804
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:23,910
可曾想替纳瓦霍人做些什么? 
and what they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?

805
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,700
奇克  你有没听说过?
 You ever read about that, Chick?

806
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,560
从没想过
Didn't think so.

807
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,970
乔  你呢?
How about you, Joe?

808
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:34,200
什么?
What?

809
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:36,190
这一切结束后你打算去做什么?
What are you doin' after this mess?

810
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:38,130
结束后再说吧
It's gotta end sometime.

811
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,290
亲爱的乔
Dear Joe,

812
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:45,670
今天我们有个大好消息
we got great news today.

813
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:49,500
罗斯福总统宣布夏威夷解放
President Roosevelt announced the end of blackouts on Hawaii.

814
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,160
我们以为这一天 永远也不会来到
We thought the day would never come.

815
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,410
虽然十点以后仍然实行戒严
There's still a ten o'clock curfew,

816
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,080
但对我没什么影响
but it doesn't matter to me.

817
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:03,330
12小时轮班  我累得除了写信  不能做别的事
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired to do anything but write letters.

818
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,400
我预感战争会明朗化
There is a real sense that the war is going well...

819
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,620
很快就会结束
and could be over soon.

820
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:16,060
我越来越想你
I think about you more and more.

821
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,350
不知你是死是活
If you're alive or dead out there.

822
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:20,930
我每天查信
I check the mail every day,

823
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,240
从未有回音
knowing there's going to be an answer.

824
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:25,670
你到底有没有读我的信呢?
Are you reading these, Joe?

825
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,160
你在听吗?
Are you listening?

826
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:34,840
-左翼安全  -是个安全区域
-We're secure on the left side. -Area's secured.

827
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,400
建立防御阵地
Set up defense positions.

828
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:38,760
奇克  晚上要戒严
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.

829
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:41,540
哈里
Harri.

830
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:40,040
怎么了?

831
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,480
我受伤了

832
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,040
这儿有些止痛药

833
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,590
别担心  没事的

834
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:14,040
谢谢叔叔

835
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,810
这样听起来才比较像样点
That's startin' to sound like something.

836
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:26,320
我没想到你还挺会画画
I didn't know you were an artist.

837
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:28,030
随便乱涂的
Oh, it's stupid.

838
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,840
我小时候 
It's just...

839
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,980
在我奶奶的餐桌上乱画
something I would do as a kid on my grandmother's kitchen table.

840
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:36,200
蛮不错的
Well, it's nice.

841
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,230
你是天主教徒吗?
You Catholic?

842
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,730
以前是
I used to be.

843
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,070
我在想我加入教会的情形
I was thinkin' about when they confirmed me.

844
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:52,130
在我八岁时  他们在我身上涂上圣水
I was eight, and they anointed me with the holy water.

845
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,440
我记得 
And I remember...

846
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:58,560
他们告诉我我是神的战士
they told me I was a soldier of Christ.

847
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:05,570
我想我该跳槽了
I guess somewhere along the way I must have switched units.

848
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:09,780
是油
It's oil.

849
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,910
啊?
Uh?

850
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:14,700
那不是圣水
They don't use holy water to confirm.

851
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,000
是油
They use oil.

852
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,480
我也接受过洗礼
I was raised Catholic too.

853
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:21,580
在保留区内的外交使节学校
Mission school on the reservation.

854
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,710
真好笑
It's funny.

855
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:27,200
神父不喜欢我们在说纳瓦霍话
Fathers didn't like us talking Navajo at Mass.

856
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:31,230
当然  那个星期天我忘了祷告

他们把我绑在地下室的散热器旁

859

我那时也是八岁

860
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,860
他们现在允许你说纳瓦霍话了
Well, they're sure lettin' you talk Navajo now.

861
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:46,980
是啊
Yeah.

862
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:56,370
当这一切都结束
You know, when this is over,

863
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:59,500
也许你可以来我们的家乡

864
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,190
纪念碑山谷

美丽而宁静

我们能去做些在部队里没做过的事

I don't know. It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.

872
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,330
但很值得
But it might be worth it.

873
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,120
你还可以来见见我的儿子
You know, you could meet my son.

874
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:34,130
他就能见到那个
And he could meet Joe Enders,

875

01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:34,960
你没有在听我说话
You're not hearing me.

907

现在全世界都有战争
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide,

不会因你的意愿而停止
and it ain't bein' waged on your wants and wishes.

910
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:47,080

Now you get some sack time. That's an order.

911
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,460

912
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:49,960
我做不到
I can't do it!

913
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,300
我无法执行我的任务
I can't perform my duty!

914
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,460
小宝贝
Hey there, sweetheart.

924
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,860
哈瑞肯  快走

934
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:45,720
我们不能让他们抓住
I can't let 'em take us.

935
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,880
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

936
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:44,280
别杀他

937
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:45,830
他很重要

938
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:49,060
我们带他去审问

939
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,540
恩德斯
Enders!

940
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:24,410
我找不到公牛和白马
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.

941
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:29,220
你看见他了吗?
Have you seen them?

942
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:32,700
他就在那儿
He's over there.

943
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,000
可恶 
Oh, shit...

944
01:41:57,390 --> 01:41:59,720
这不是安全区域吗!
This was supposed to be a secured area!

945
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:01,280
发生了什么事?
What happened?

946
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:06,460
我杀了他
I killed him.

947
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:09,890
你..你什么?
You...you what?

948
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,200
我扔手雷出去
I took my grenade and...

949
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:16,670
把他炸死了
and I threw it and I blew him up.

950
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:26,860
你他妈的疯了吗?
What the hell is wrong with you?

951
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,970
亚奇
Yahzee!

952
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,660
亚奇  不要
Yahzee! Yahzee, no!

953
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:35,130
起来
Get up!

954
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:41,620
来吧
Come on.

955
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,460
你动手吧!
You can do it.

956
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:44,310
亚奇
Yahzee.

957
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,080
让他开枪
Let him go.

958
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,710
亚奇  别这样
Yahzee, no.

959
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:52,000
快点呀  为什么不开枪  来呀  开枪啊
Go on. Why can't...Come on. Do it.

960
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:53,260
开枪啊!
Do it!

961
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:54,100
不要
No.

962
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:29,440
我们听说了白马的事了   亚奇

963
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:32,140
我们会为他的名字 与事迹感到光荣

964
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:34,450
永别了  查理  永别了

965
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:38,730
查理  永别了

966
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,330
白马 
You know, Whitehorse...

967
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,030
他救了我
he saved my bacon.

968
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,420
我想早点对他好点就好了
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer would make of that.

969
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:08,950
我记得我的祖父坐在走廊说一些 
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on the porch talkin' about...

970
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,010
屠杀印地安人的事
huntin' Indians,

971
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:14,770
他曾经说过
like he was talkin' about gophers or somethin'.

972
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:18,050
每个科曼奇人(印第安的一个种族)的耳朵
About gettin' paid three dollars...

973
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:20,130
能换3美元
per Comanche ear.

974
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:23,090
我知道
I know.

975
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,010
你在想什么
Gets you thinkin'.

976
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:28,020
谁知道呢?
Another 50 years,

977
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,040
再过50年
who knows,

978
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:31,430
也许我们会与日本人坐在一起
we could be sitting' down with the Nipponese.

979
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:33,650
喝着日本米酒
Drinkin' their sake,

980
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:35,610
聊一些废话
shootin' the shit...

981
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:39,860
看别人的屁股
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.

982
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,270
你想得太多了
You think too much.

983
01:44:49,890 --> 01:44:52,360
第一次听别人这样说我
First time I ever been accused of that.

984
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:35,540
(印第安语)

985
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:58,430
说过你不准自己四处乱跑
Thought I told you not to go traipsing around on your own.

986
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,150
查理在我儿子出生时
You know, Charlie blessed my son...

987
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:11,560
用这方式祝福过他
in the Navajo way the day he was born.

988
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:21,680
他猜不透为什么牛仔要注意印第安人的后背
He wondered about cowboys watching Indians' backs.

989
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:24,650
他猜不透其中的奥妙
Something about it didn't seem right.

990
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:28,120
我想查理就是查理
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.

991
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:32,530
他压根都不想参加这该死的战争
He didn't even want to come to this damn war.

992
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:35,500
是我要他来的
I talked him into it.

993
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:40,740
也许你做错了
Maybe you made a mistake.

994
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:54,000
也许我们都死了
Maybe we all did.

995
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:57,660
本  我只是奉命行事
I was following orders, Ben.

996
01:46:58,790 --> 01:47:02,090
我接到的命令是保护密码
My orders were to protect the code.

997
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:04,390
如果你们被抓
If one of you got caught,

998
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:06,150
被审讯
talked,

999
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,680
密码就没用了
the code would be useless.

1000
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:17,800
我在按命令行事  本
I was following orders, Ben.

你是个他妈的好军人
You're a damn good fuckin' marine.

1003
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,560
头儿想见你
The Viking wants to see you.

1004
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:45,310
他要你马上去

1005
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:54,280
我要你给每个人下达简令
I want you to brief everybody,

1006
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:56,000
让他们明白发生了什么事

1007
01:47:56,190 --> 01:47:57,090
好的
All right.

很好
That's good.

1010
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:00,880
你在找我吗?
You wanted to see me?

1011
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:02,180
对
Yeah.

1012
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,540
第八军团已经出发了
The 8th is moving out already...

1013
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:06,370
我们要赶在他们前面
and we need to be ahead of 'em.

1014
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,460
目标是那边那块大岩石
The destination is that big piece of rock you see over there.

1015
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:14,440
这是这岛上最后一块根据地
The last defensible ridge on this island.

1016
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,820
现在的想法是  我们搞定这个山头
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount,

1017
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:19,330
塞班就归我们了
Saipan is pretty much ours.

1018
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,040
昨天轰炸机炸过那块岩石
Yesterday, bombers beat the shit out of that rock.

1019
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:28,410
这些混蛋很顽强
The brass is nervous.

1020
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:31,010
他们预计会有很大的抵抗
They expected more resistance over there.

1021
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:34,850
现在他们想让我们去查看一下
Now they want us to go over and check it out.

1022
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:37,840
那他们现在要我们做什么
So where the hell they got us now?

1023
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:40,210
到山上去
Goin' up the mountain.

1024
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:43,080
侦查情况
Have ourselves a little peek.

1025
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,710
那个解译员也要到前线去
That codetalker is out front for a reason.

1026
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:52,320
我要的正是这种人
That's exactly where I need him to be.

1027
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:56,220
既然你们之间还有隔阂
If there's still a problem between the two of you,

1028
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:59,250
我希望你们在此时此地解决问题
I would like to straighten that out, right here, right now.

1029
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:03,290
没问题
No problem here, Gunny.

1030
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:04,500
很好
That's good.

1031
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,970
但另外 
But there's still one here.

1032
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,800
你只须做你该做的  中士
You just do what you're supposed to do, Sergeant.

1033
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:13,800
不要多做也不要少做
Nothing more, nothing less.

1034
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:21,200

Enders.

1035

你又有一封信
You got another letter.

1036
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:31,380
别动
Freeze!

1037
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:47,190
老天  我们走到该死的地雷区来了
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle of a goddamn minefield!

1038
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:49,180
奇克会带我们出去的
Chick's gonna get us out.

1039
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:50,400
对吧? 奇克
Right, Chick?

1040
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:52,360
我当然会
Sure I am.

1041
