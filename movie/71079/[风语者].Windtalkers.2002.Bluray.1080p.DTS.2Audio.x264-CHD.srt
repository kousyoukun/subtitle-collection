我担心你赶不上这班巴士
I wasn't so sure you'd be on the bus.

不想让你的白人弟兄们误以为
Didn't want your white brothers
thinking

That's what happens to a man

52
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:31,749
你不读我的唇语才会这样
It happens when you're
not watching my lips, Joe.

53
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:39,062
看我
Watch this.

You can't go back to war

Let's go, marines. This war
ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.

乔伊?
Joe...

为什么你不好好留下来?

00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,224
总得有人留下来陪妇女救护团

TBY hasn't got the range of the TBX.

69
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:33,369
所以讯号可能要分程传递
So you may need a relay to get
your transmission to command post.

70
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:37,770
但重点是压力下的速度与精准
But what it really comes down to

00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:11,968
比从军前的行为好多了

on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

85
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,539
连教士都打?

他是齐纳主教高中副校长
兼训导主任

在上海获颁最佳勇气奖

90
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,827
死守所罗门群岛表现杰出
And you made a hell of a stand
on the Solomons.

91
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:46,994
那儿很苦吧?
Tough bit of business there, huh?

92
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,366
相当艰苦,长官
Pretty tough, sir.

93
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:52,740
可是,你想再回去?
But you're prepared
to jump right back into it?

94
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,672
是的,长官,非常想
Yes, sir. Very much so.

95
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,105
非常想
Very much so.

96
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:00,807
可是…
Well...

97
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:07,386
我们的密码全遭日军破解
The Japs have pretty much busted
every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.

98
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:10,517
你在所罗门群岛的弟兄
因密码被破解全部阵亡
You men on the Solomons
were lost to a broken code.

99
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:15,227
在所罗门碰到过印地安人吗?
Tell me something. You ever
run into any Indians on the Solomons?

100
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:18,358
-印地安人,长官?
-正确的说,应该是纳瓦荷人
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.

101
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,104
军方用他们的语言
发展出一套新密码
The Corps has developed a new code
based on their language.

102
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,141
评价相当不错
It's had quite an impact.

103
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:29,269
所以海军总部下令全力保护它
So much so the navy have decided
to go to great lengths to protect it.

104
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,580
这就是找你来的原因
That's why you're here.

105
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:35,750
你将与密码战士配对
全力保护他们
You're to pair with one of them,
keep his ass safe.

106
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,083
你负责保护他们的性命
以利他们执行密码任务
Your job is to keep him alive
so he can do his job.

107
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:43,492
抱歉,我的专长是屠杀日军
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,

108
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:45,528
不是照顾印地安人
not baby-sitting some Indian.

109
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:48,461
我们不是随便挑到你的
Enders, we didn't pick
your name out of a hat.

110
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,201
我们需要的是杰出陆战队员
We need good marines.

111
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:53,897
所以才选上你
That's why you're standing here.

112
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,803
你看
Take a look.

113
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,034
他就是个纳瓦荷人…应该死了
It's a Navajo. Or it was.

114
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,078
遭日军逼问密码
严刑拷打致死
Tortured to death by Japanese
intelligence trying to bust our code.

115
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:06,615
所幸,他想说也说不出所以然
Fortunately, he couldn't help them
even if he wanted to.

116
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:10,311
-长官?
-他是纳瓦荷人但不是密码战士
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.

117
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:14,016
密码由他们的语言编成
但毕竟还是密码
Code's based on their language,
but it is still a code.

118
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,093
东条巴不得活捉一个密码战士
Tojo would like nothing more
than to catch a live one.

119
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:24,296
我以下的话,绝不能漏出去
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal,
cannot leave this room.

120
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:31,537
不管在任何情况下
密码战士绝不能落入敌人手中
Under no circumstances can you allow
your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.

121
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,511
你的任务是保护密码
Your mission is to protect the code...

122
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,215
不惜任何代价
at all costs.

123
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,452
懂我的意思吗?
You understand me?

124
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,886
是的,长官,我懂
Yes, sir, I do.

125
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,652
很好
Good.

126
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,353
恭喜你,你刚获升中士
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.

127
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,910
手臂保持垂直
Keep those hands vertical.

128
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,916
不错,阿兵哥
Way to go, marine.

129
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,855
佛第诺,接替我一下
Fortino, take over.

130
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,953
少校办公室外的是你,对吧?
Hey... That was you, right,
sitting in front of the major's office?

131
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:03,293
我叫彼得韩德森
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.

132
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:08,034
他们叫我公牛
不是因为我的肌肉
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.

133
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:12,268
是因为我住在加州公牛城
好莱坞北边一点点
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.

134
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,405
你也是两栖作战通讯连的人?
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

135
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:21,676
请问两栖通讯二分队怎么走?
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

136
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:22,081
请问两栖通讯二分队怎么走?
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

137
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,381
没听说过,老土
No fuckin' idea, mac.

138
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,523
多谢
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

139
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:34,592
从没看过那么多白人
I've never seen so many white men.

140
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:40,066
他们也没看过那么多纳瓦荷人
They've never seen so many Navajo.

141
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,600
看起来你上过战场
Looks to me like you got to see
a little action there.

142
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,341
我也是
Me too.

143
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,746
屁股挨了日本鬼子的子弹
Jap sons of bitches
shot me right in the ass.

144
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,978
相不相信?
并不是我想逃避上前线
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.

145
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:04,991
你在两栖通讯的任务
跟这些纳瓦荷通信兵有关吗?
So, your duty with JASCO have anything
to do with these Navajo radiomen?

146
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,557
我奉命守密
I'm not at liberty to say.

147
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:14,266
我发现你升官了,我也是
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.

148
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:20,803
我猜,你不能说的秘密
跟我不能说的是一样
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell
me are the same orders I can't tell you.

149
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,572
了不起的任务吧?
Hell of a thing, huh?

150
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:25,307
身不由己,中士,这里是军队
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.

151
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,147
他们看起来蛮正常的
They look pretty normal, I guess.

152
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,622
难道他们得喷上迷彩?
Expecting them to wear war paint?

153
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,863
或许该过去打个招呼
他们好像迷路了
Maybe we ought to go introduce
ourselves. They look a little lost to me.

154
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,627
韩德森
Henderson.

155
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,406
我不想跟他们太亲近
I wouldn't get too friendly.

156
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:57,214
怎么样?
How!

157
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:59,446
开个玩笑,我叫公牛
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.

158
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,245
我叫白马
Whitehorse.

159
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:03,250
他姓亚吉,叫班
This is Yahzee. Ben.

160
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,390
-下一位
-漂亮
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

161
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,756
闭着眼睛会比较好吃
下一个是谁?
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?

162
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:52,860
可以一起吃吗?
Mind if I join you?

163
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:57,402
我叫班亚吉,跟你同一组
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.

164
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:00,038
你好吗?
How you doin'?

165
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,904
你挡住我的视线了
You're blocking my view.

166
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,084
对不起
Oh, sorry.

167
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,852
这难吃的东西是什么?
What do they call this crap anyway?

168
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:14,991
军方称之为食物
Marines call it chow.

169
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:20,556
有广告不实的嫌疑哦
Well, there's a propaganda effort.

170
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:32,974
对不起,我的赔你
Sorry. You can have mine.

171
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:35,607
啊,糟糕
Shit.

172
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,920
你说你叫什么名字,二兵?
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?

173
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,250
我叫班亚吉
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.

174
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,659
端着
Hold this.

175
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,140
可恶
Shit.

176
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,250
你的白人搭档怎么样？
How's your white man?

177
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,688
饥饿
Hungry.

178
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,828
我再玩几把
I'm in for a couple more.

179
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:37,573
写信给你儿子？
You writing to your son?

180
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,642
帮我问个好
Tell him I say hello.

181
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:43,179
大恩先生K一对
Pair of cowboys for Big E.

182
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:48,081
-希腊人可能是顺子
-可能是一手乌龙啦
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.

183
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:51,177
小伙子2一对,有前途
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.

184
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:55,324
有人胆子不小
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.

185
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,021
好啦
All right.

186
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:01,622
佛州小子陷入两难
OK... Oh, another mess
for the Sunshine State.

187
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:04,427
-你对我不爽?
-我只是想赢你的钱
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.

188
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:07,060
9三条!漂亮
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.

189
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:09,399
-你牌到底有没有洗?
-当然有
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.

190
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,373
9喊,我加两毛五
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.

191
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,110
我跟
Call.

192
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,237
我们都是一手烂牌
We all got thumbs up our asses.

193
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:22,512
玩不久了,我朋友在军机处
他说我们下周开拔
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy
in Intel that says we ship out in a week.

194
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,588
“下周”已经说一个月了
I been hearing "next week" for a month.

195
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:28,589
我不知道你有朋友在军机处
I didn't know you knew
anybody in Intelligence, Harri.

196
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,590
拖到明年我也无所谓
Next year'd be all right with me.

197
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:36,188
各位,哭吧,9带4
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.

198
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,066
葫芦
Full boat, baby.

199
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,433
K带Q葫芦,哭死你
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.

200
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,507
这怎么可能!
Oh, Jesus!

201
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:50,971
-我不玩了
-我要去写信给老婆
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.

202
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:54,346
天知道女人收不到音讯会干嘛
God knows what a girlwill do
without reassurance.

203
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,052
烂角
Son of a bitch.

204
00:25:57,187 --> 00:26:01,590
有空位了,一起玩吗?
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats
opening up. You wanna come join us?

205
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:05,184
你开玩笑的吧?
Are you serious?

206
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,857
红番扑克?你们怎么玩?
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?

207
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,492
牌放在头上,白痴都一目了然
Card on the head,
only fool can't see it is you.

208
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:17,266
到底要不要过来坐?
You want to come on over, or what?

209
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,546
算我一份
Cut me in.

210
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:31,551
我想玩大小通吃
最大最小都赢,A可以当两头
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

211
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:35,352
我想玩大小通吃
最大最小都赢,A可以当两头
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

212
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,221
别被他唬住
Hey, don't let him scare you.

213
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:42,424
反正就是大小通吃
了不起浪费时间跟金钱
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's
like any other. Waste of time and money.

214
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,599
出底钱,酋长
Well, ante up... Chief.

215
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:49,338
你怎么知道我是酋长?
How'd you know I was a chief?

216
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:52,670
你一定看过我戴着战帽洗澡
You must've seen me showering
with my war bonnet.

217
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:09,385
-发牌
-我们可不收贝壳串
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.

218
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:11,460
真好听
Beautiful.

219
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:38,654
听好了,各位
All right, then.

220
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:41,154
命令终于下来了
Orders finally came through.

221
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,351
我们明天早上出航
We ship out tomorrow morning.

222
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:54,461
目的地：塞班岛
Destination: the island of Saipan,

223
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:59,872
它是我们通往东京的跳板
which is one of the stepping stones
we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.

224
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,609
攻下这个岛极具战略价值
It's of strategic importance
that we capture this island.

225
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:06,443
可以成立海军前进基地
We can get ourselves
an advanced naval base

226
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,848
和空军跑道
以便B29降落和加油
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's

227
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:12,785
那么东京就在轰炸航程内了
and get our bombers
within range of Tokyo.

228
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:19,087
目前塞班岛是日本的领土
上面驻守有三万日军
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil,
and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.

229
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:21,663
他们必然会死守到底
They're gonna fight for every square inch,

230
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,394
因为那是他们的家
但我们要把它抢过来!
because it's their home,
but we're gonna take it away from 'em!

231
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:29,071
杀日本鬼子!
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!

232
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:37,207
我们是整个师的先头部队
We're gonna be in front
of the whole damn division.

233
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,908
我们是全师的耳目
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.

234
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:43,209
我们要闻出敌军的所在地点
We're gonna be
sniffin' out enemy positions,

235
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,218
协调海军炮火
coordinating the naval gunfire -

236
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:50,224
任务跟四个月来的训练一样
没问题吧?
exactly what we've been training to do
for the last four months. All right?

237
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:01,400
司令部派来了几位通信兵
Now, we got some new radiomen
from headquarters.

238
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:04,373
二等兵白马
There's a Private Whitehorse...

239
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:10,212
和亚吉
and Yahzee...

240
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:15,818
以及两位中士
恩得斯和韩德森
and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson,

241
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:19,048
他们…依据命令…
who, if I'm understanding
these orders correctly,

242
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:22,454
将掩护我们的纳瓦荷战士
will be covering our Navajos' asses.

243
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:47,309
你他妈的,乔伊恩得斯!
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

244
00:29:55,959 --> 00:30:01,192
现在轮到我们赴汤蹈火了
..but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin'
into our share of the shit nonetheless.

245
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:05,793
有问题吗?
Any questions?

246
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,814
听起来你好像快挂了
Sounds like you're dying.

247
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,653
这可以帮你消除气味
These might help get rid of the taste.

248
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:35,129
查理和我从圣地牙哥坐船来时
也吐得死去活来
Charlie and I, we both lost it
on the boat ride from San Diego.

249
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:38,034
亚历桑那有水的地方并不多
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.

250
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,728
口气清香糖还蛮有用的
Life Savers really helped.

251
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,205
要不要来一个?
You want a Life Saver?

252
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,834
你为什么来这里?
What are you doin' here?

253
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,546
想帮个小忙罢了
Just trying to help.

254
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:00,288
我不是这个意思
Not what I meant.

255
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:03,982
你是说,我为什么从军?
You mean what am I doing
in this uniform?

256
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:07,028
战争也跟我有关啊,中士
It's my war too, Sergeant.

257
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:10,725
为我的国家、土地、同胞而战
I'm fighting for my country,
for my land, for my people.

258
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:14,503
我担心的倒不是你的同胞
Not your people I'm worried about.

259
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:18,937
恩得斯,我是个密码战士
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.

260
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:23,035
我只要二分半钟就可以解读
一般人一小时才懂的东西
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes
to do what used to take an hour.

261
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:26,241
有位官阶比你高很多的人
Now, somebody wearing
a lot more stripes than you

262
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:28,749
认为这东西很有价值
thinks that's worth something.

走到我身边,问我饿不饿
She walks straight up to me
and asks me if I'm hungry...

383
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:49,723
因为她只吃条小热狗

384
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,691
哇靠!

387
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:04,968

and I'm roastin' human beings.

388
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:14,917
为什么会自愿从军
我实在搞不懂
Why I volunteered... beyond me.

389
00:51:17,053 --> 00:51:19,521
我倒是觉得蛮骄傲的

万一我出了事
If anything should happen to me,

398
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,688
这个请交给我太太
you make sure that my wife gets this.

399
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,798
这是她亲手挑的
I mean, she picked them out and all.

400
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,234
不要说这种话,奈尔
Don't talk like that, Nell.

401
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:09,163
连玩笑都不要开
You don't even joke about shit like that.

402
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,105
戴回去,你会平安回家
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.

403
00:53:10,233 --> 00:53:12,463
喝过才谢我还不迟
Don't thank me till you've tried it.

404
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:15,198
发信时你不在
You missed mailcall.

405
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:18,398
“乔伊恩得斯收
丽塔史维登寄”

406
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:27,642
他们在干嘛?
What the hell are they doin'?

407
00:53:28,518 --> 00:53:31,248
不知道,日落后就忙个不停
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.

408
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:40,191
听起来像是祈祷
Sounds like some kind of prayer.

409
00:53:47,637 --> 00:53:49,798
或许他们知道我们的命令
Maybe they know our orders.

410
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:06,486
你下得了手吗,乔伊?
Think you could do it, Joe?

411
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:08,648
不要一直想这问题,韩德森
Give it a rest, Henderson.

412
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:12,484
不要想?我试过,可是…
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...

413
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,055
该杀的是日本人,不是自己人
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.

414
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:24,172
你是个勇士，亚吉
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...

415
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,699
你是家族的荣耀
You will make your family proud.

416
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:19,755
你在干嘛,老弟?
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

417
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:22,093
正要穿上制服
Getting on my uniform.

418
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:25,860
知道你跟日本人
有什么差别吗?
You know the difference
between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

419
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:30,605
差在制服
It's that uniform.

420
00:55:31,274 --> 00:55:33,208
仅此而已
That's it.

421
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:36,608
我了解你们这些人
See, I know you people.

422
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,641
我清楚你们这些凤眼野蛮人
I know what kind
of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.

423
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:43,713
落单时当心一点
You ought to be careful out here all alone.

424
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:46,455
没有人照顾你时
No baby-sitter.

425
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:48,957
我可能会把你看成日本鬼子
I might just take you for a Jap.

426
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:52,390
你要让我穿衣服吗,奇克?
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

427
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:55,623
还是继续演无知的白痴?
Or keep demonstrating
what an ignorant fool you are?

428
00:56:00,704 --> 00:56:03,002
无知的白痴是吧?
How's that for an ignorant fool?

429
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:22,848
拿啊,你试试看
Go ahead, try again.

430
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:36,597
你不是想干什么吗?
You gonna do somethin'?

431
00:56:58,328 --> 00:56:59,795
奇克,住手
Chick! Come on!

432
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:01,830
走开!
Get off me!

433
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:23,976
-你没事吧,班?
-没事
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.

434
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,384
班?恶心
Ben? Shit.

435
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:33,624
我以为他是日本人
杀我弟兄,偷穿制服
I thought he was a Jap. You know,
killed some marine for that uniform.

436
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:37,263
再扯嘛,奇克
Sure you did, Chick.

437
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,464
死红番不像日本鬼子吗?
Damn Injun looks just like
a Jap, don't he?

438
00:57:40,603 --> 00:57:42,503
我不是死红番
Look, I'm no damn Injun.

439
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:48,108
我是纳瓦荷人
母系是苦水族,父系是塔楼族
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,
born for the Towering House clan.

440
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:53,873
但长相蛮像日本人
But you do look like a Nip.

441
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:58,920
下次要洗澡先通知我
否则我踢你屁股
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.

442
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:04,793
妈的败类
Fuckin' shitbird.

443
00:58:05,962 --> 00:58:08,590
他随时都需要人照顾
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter
all the time, I thought.

444
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:10,596
连出去打鱼时也一样
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.

445
00:58:12,936 --> 00:58:17,396
昨晚你看到的是
我们的庇护仪式
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.

446
00:58:18,374 --> 00:58:24,335
纳瓦荷人相信尸体未安葬前
灵魂会一直待在附近
Navajo believe, untila body's given
a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.

447
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:29,285
我们称恶灵为仙邸司
Chindis - that's what
we call evilspirits. Demons.

448
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:35,024
我从小不曾认真想过这问题
I haven't thought much about it
since I was a kid.

449
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:37,524
直到我目睹这些死尸
Till I saw those dead bodies.

450
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,151
你是说你看得到鬼魂?
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

451
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:42,629
不,我是说我不再害怕了
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.

452
00:58:43,132 --> 00:58:46,101
因为你朋友在你额头上抹灰?
Because your buddy
smeared ash on your forehead?

453
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:50,468
没错,因为我朋友
在我额头上抹灰
That's right. Cos my buddy
smeared ash on my forehead.

454
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:00,307
你看过鬼吗?
You ever see ghosts?

455
00:59:05,221 --> 00:59:08,987
不要再问傻问题了
这是命令
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.

456
00:59:40,657 --> 00:59:42,591
真好听
Sounds beautiful.

457
00:59:43,326 --> 00:59:45,294
无师自通吗?
You, uh, you self-taught?

458
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:48,222
我爸爸常吹
My dad was always playing.

459
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:52,360
他们不是说“拼不过他就…”
You know what they say:
if you can't beat 'em...

460
00:59:52,502 --> 00:59:57,701
正确,这是我爸送我的
No shit. My dad, he...
he gave me this thing.

461
00:59:59,008 --> 01:00:01,533
他以前叫我小猪魔笛
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.

462
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:05,512
我一吹它们就过来吃饲料
Used to bring 'em in for feeding
with this little tune I played.

463
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:09,710
我知道你不会停止吹笛子
I know I ain't gonna get you
to quit playin' that thing, so...

464
01:00:09,852 --> 01:00:12,412
所以“拼不过他就…”
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...

465
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:14,785
我觉得声音不协调
I don't think it's gonna work.

466
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:19,455
反正别无他法,管他的
Well, we ain't got much else
to do out here. What the hell?

467
01:00:20,663 --> 01:00:22,290
好吧
OK.

468
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:25,830
你起音,我来和
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.

469
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,899
第二侦查队0600出发
2nd Recon Company will move out
at 0600 

470
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:07,566
沿四号路搜索下去
and scout along road 04.

471
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:11,271
椰林西北边可能遭到轻微抵抗
You can expect light resistance
northwest of the palm grove. Over.

472
01:01:12,281 --> 01:01:16,445
收到，何谓“轻微”？
没有任何抵抗是轻微的，完毕
Roger. What do you mean, light?
No resistance is light! Over.

473
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:19,387
记住座右铭不问为什么
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to
question why, 

474
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:20,614
只管拼命与牺牲
ours is but to do or die."

475
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:22,349
“永远忠诚”完毕
Semper Fi. Over.

476
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:37,006
亲爱的乔伊,你到底怎么了?
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

477
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:42,535
因为你不爱写信
就应该音讯全无吗?
Or, given that you're not much of a
writer, should I not expect an answer?

478
01:01:42,678 --> 01:01:45,545
报上说,我军战果辉煌
The newspapers say
our boys are doing great.

479
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:50,118
但我想记者都没看到
肯尼欧湾医院的伤兵
But I don't think the reporters
have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.

480
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,280
前几天在瓦基基捡到只流浪狗
I found a stray dog
the other day on Waikiki.

481
01:01:54,424 --> 01:01:57,086
带回家洗个澡留下来养
I gave him a bath and took him in.

482
01:01:57,226 --> 01:02:00,684
它令我想起你,但它比较可爱
He reminded me of you - but cuter.

483
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:05,192
至少它晚上给我温暖
At least he keeps me warm at night.

484
01:02:06,436 --> 01:02:11,032
我尽量不想你
也不去想可能发生的事
I try not to think about you. About
what might be happening over there.

485
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:14,035
但是,有时候躺在床上
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,

486
01:02:14,177 --> 01:02:17,476
忍不住担心你的处境
I can't keep myself
from wondering where you are.

487
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:19,547
和过得好不好
How you're doing.

488
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:32,027
你在干嘛?
What the hell you doin'?

489
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:35,095
写信给我儿子
Writing a letter to my son.

490
01:02:35,231 --> 01:02:37,722
你忘了命令?不准流出一个字
Forget your orders? No letters out.

491
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:41,596
上面不准邮件进入保育区
Command don't want postmarks
going to the reservation.

492
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:48,206
没听到吗?
Hey! You hear me?

493
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:57,182
我回家后他就看得到啦
I thought that he might read 'em
when I get home.

494
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:04,984
他叫什么名字?
What's his name?

495
01:03:05,128 --> 01:03:06,993
你儿子
Your son.

496
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,524
乔治,乔治华盛顿
It's George. George Washington.

497
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:14,162
乔治华盛顿亚吉
George Washington Yahzee.

498
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:18,466
听起来蛮响亮的
It's got a bit of a ring to it.

499
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:21,909
我太太不太喜欢
My wife wasn't so sure.

500
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:24,845
她比较传统
She's a little more traditional.

501
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,118
-好漂亮的一家人
-给我看看,亚吉
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.

502
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:34,849
乔治很有个性
他有自己的想法
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.

503
01:03:38,427 --> 01:03:40,486
我可以抽一根吗?
Can I try one of those?

504
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:44,197
-你抽烟?
-抽着玩的
- You smoke?
- Not really.

505
01:04:23,105 --> 01:04:25,505
-下来!
-快下车!
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!

506
01:04:26,676 --> 01:04:28,610
动作快!
Let's go! Let's go!

507
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:31,178
-跟我来!
-走!
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

508
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:41,554
我中弹了!
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!

509
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:45,217
亚吉
Yahzee!

510
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,252
我中弹了!
I'm hit!

511
01:04:48,431 --> 01:04:50,592
拿下来!好烫!
Take it off! It burns!

512
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:57,571
你没中弹,闭嘴!
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit.

513
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:17,957
-散开!
-动作快!
- Spread out!
- Move!

514
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:29,497
-炸弹从哪来的?
-我们自己人
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.

515
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:32,774
-什么?
-那不是日本人的炮
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.

516
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:37,377
-自己人炸自己人?
-我们应该走四号路
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.

517
01:05:37,513 --> 01:05:39,310
-通知团部
-没办法!
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!

518
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:43,782
-告诉他们炸到自己人
-不行!无线电炸坏了
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.

519
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:49,553
-他们炸太近了
-日本鬼子一定在我们前面
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.

520
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:51,216
想点办法
Do somethin'.

521
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,760
跟我来
Shit... Follow me!

522
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:56,591
-我们走错路了
-干!
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!

523
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:20,188
完蛋了!
God.

524
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:44,572
龟孙子
Son of a bitch!

525
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:08,426
不要怕,老哥!
I got you, mac!

526
01:07:13,442 --> 01:07:15,205
救护兵!
Corpsman!

527
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:18,675
救护兵!
Corpsman!

528
01:07:24,153 --> 01:07:26,144
救护兵!
Corpsman!

529
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,690
奈里!
Nellie!

530
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:35,429
救护兵!
Corpsman!

531
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:07,089
你说的没错,乔伊
You were right, Joe.

532
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:09,592
我长得像日本人
I do look like a Nip.

533
01:08:09,732 --> 01:08:11,757
你在说什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

534
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:13,266
穿上他们的制服
Putting on that Jap uniform. 

535
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:16,269
用他们的无线电
通知我方停火
Trying to get
one of their radios, call off our guns.

536
01:08:16,405 --> 01:08:19,101
-笨主意
-闭嘴,让他说完
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.

537
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:22,301
-他不能出去
-这里不由你指挥,恩得斯
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.

538
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:24,936
我身负命令,枪头
我要保护他
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!

539
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:32,350
他还年轻啊!
你们在杀自己人!
He's just a kid! You killed your own!

540
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:37,685
你们有毛病啊!
你们在杀自己人!王八蛋!
What's wrong with you?
You killed your own! Sons of bitches!

541
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,757
你们在杀自己人!
You killed your own!

542
01:08:56,412 --> 01:09:00,143
-你确定要这么做?
-马上就知道答案了,长官
- Sure you're up to this?
- Find out soon enough, sir.

543
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:06,213
-你想干嘛?
-我跟他去
- What the hell are you doin' there?
- I'm goin' with him.

544
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:08,550
如果你没意见的话
If that's OK with you.

545
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:13,927
枪给我
Give me the rifle.

546
01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:19,494
Horyo-da.

547
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:22,194
“战俘”的日本话
It's Jap for prisoner.

548
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:24,963
Horyo-da.

549
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:34,973
Horyo-da.

550
01:09:37,987 --> 01:09:40,251
好啦,大家准备
All right, everybody be ready.

551
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:39,139
Horyo-da!

552
01:10:45,688 --> 01:10:46,814
冲啊!
Now!

553
01:10:58,934 --> 01:11:00,697
打我
Hit me. Hit me.

554
01:11:16,619 --> 01:11:18,553
不要打我!
Please don't hit me!

555
01:11:58,293 --> 01:11:59,590
亚吉
Yahzee!

556
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:11,165
杀了他!
Kill him!

557
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:18,805
快点,杀了他!
Goddamn it, kill him!

558
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:27,250
去无线电那!
Get on the radio!

559
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:38,757
白鲍威,这是红卡森!
Bowie White, Bowie White,
this is Carson Red!

560
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:44,463
停火!你们在炸自己人!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
You're shelling marines!

561
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:47,842
中士!
Sergeant!

562
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:52,404
停火!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

563
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,677
距离加325米,立刻射击!
Add 325, fire for effect!

564
01:12:58,987 --> 01:13:02,616
调整!加325米,立刻射击!
Redirect fire. Add 325, fire for effect.

565
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:05,226
走啦!
Let's go!

566
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,654
摇高点!快!
Crank it up! Let's go!

567
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:11,424
开火!
Commence fire!

568
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,363
开火!
Fire!

569
01:13:20,909 --> 01:13:22,433
奏效了
Well, I'll be.

570
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,101
请问什么事,上校?
Colonel. Can I help you, sir?

571
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,971
我想找一位恩得斯中士
约瑟夫恩得斯
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders.
Joseph F Enders.

572
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:57,941
恩得斯
Enders.

573
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:08,352
是的,长官
Yes, sir.

574
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:12,355
据报你非常神勇
Report I read claims
you went above and beyond.

575
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,122
长官
Sir?

576
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:17,596
我们已推荐你接受表扬
You've been recommended
for commendation.

577
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:20,963
我非常同意,但何必等待…
And I concur. But I don't see any point
in you having to wait around

578
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:25,369
繁复的公文往返
for all those formalities
to work themselves out.

579
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,574
我手边正好有个勋章
Not when I got one of these handy.

580
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,744
恭喜,恩得斯
Congratulations, Enders.

581
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,939
你救了不少同胞
You saved a lot of marines.

582
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:47,355
这不是我一个人的功劳,长官
多亏了二等兵班亚吉的帮忙
I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have
done it without Private Ben Yahzee.

583
01:14:47,462 --> 01:14:52,733
对,那位印地安人
Oh... Right.
The, uh, Indian.

584
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:57,763
抱歉,他是纳瓦荷人
母系苦水族
Begging the colonel's pardon,
he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,

585
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,874
父系塔楼族
born for the Towering House clan.

586
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:06,171
当然,纳瓦荷人,塔楼族
Of course. Navajo. Towering House clan.

587
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:14,882
继续保持下去,恩得斯
You keep up the good work, Enders.

588
01:15:53,629 --> 01:15:55,893
把这个寄给奈里的太太
Send that to Nellie's wife.

589
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:39,236
每次都有你的信,恩得斯
You ever not miss mailcall, Enders?

590
01:16:46,214 --> 01:16:48,774
我妈说,人家花时间写信
My mom says somebody
takes the time to write a letter,

591
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:51,078
你该花时间好好读
you should read the letter.

592
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:56,423
你妈肯让你喝酒吗?
Does she let you drink, your mother?

593
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,652
不肯,但她又不在这
No. But she's not here.

594
01:17:13,809 --> 01:17:17,506
-这是什么酒?
-确定不是法国红酒
- What is it?
- Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that.

595
01:17:17,646 --> 01:17:20,774
米酒类,是日本清酒
反正会醉就是了
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake.
But it does the trick.

596
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:26,913
你有多少这种东西?
How much of this crap
do you have anyway?

597
01:17:29,758 --> 01:17:32,454
你这只耳朵有问题对不对?
You have a little trouble with that ear,
don't you, Joe?

598
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:37,760
问题在内耳,耳鼓耳膜之类的
Ah, real problem's the inner ear.
It's anvils and stirrups and shit.

599
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:42,662
我的平衡感不太好
I'm a little out of balance.

600
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,366
你在山丘上表现很好,亚吉
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee.

601
01:17:48,577 --> 01:17:50,636
是啊,表现不错吧?
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

602
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:53,975
一定了你一跳
I bet I surprised the shit out of you.

603
01:17:59,321 --> 01:18:01,653
你的情操很崇高,乔伊
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe.

604
01:18:02,357 --> 01:18:04,723
把银星勋章给奈里的太太
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife.

605
01:18:05,093 --> 01:18:07,220
我才不在乎奖章
I don't give a shit about medals.

606
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:19,633
他们给我的第一枚
The first one they gave me...

607
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:23,402
被我扔到海里去
I threw it into the ocean.

608
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:27,982
那次是为了什么事?
What'd you get that one for?

609
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:29,811
因为我撑着没死
For not dyin'.

610
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:36,523
15个战友一起接受表扬
他们悉数阵亡
The 15 men who fought with me
got decorated too. For dying.

611
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:38,783
所以…
So...

612
01:18:43,698 --> 01:18:46,758
中尉前一晚就战死了
Lieutenant was killed
the night before and...

613
01:18:48,637 --> 01:18:53,006
士官们也全死在登陆艇里
none of the sergeants even made it
out of the landing craft, so...

614
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:58,638
所以只好由我指挥
我第一次发号施令
that left me in charge.
It was my first command.

615
01:19:00,882 --> 01:19:07,287
上面下令死守
某个鸟不拉屎的沼泽
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp
marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.

616
01:19:10,892 --> 01:19:12,826
我只好听命行事
And I did.

617
01:19:16,231 --> 01:19:19,166
我手下的弟兄
All of the men under my command...

618
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:26,540
信任我的人
men who trusted me...

619
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:35,114
全都求我撤退
who begged me to pull back...

620
01:19:39,821 --> 01:19:41,755
结果没有一个生还
not one of them made it.

621
01:19:45,694 --> 01:19:48,629
除了一个固执的浑球
Just one stupid asshole.

622
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:57,870
他们因此给我银星勋章
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.

623
01:20:00,976 --> 01:20:03,069
他们叫什么名字?
What were their names?

624
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:06,904
说他们的故事
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.

625
01:20:07,582 --> 01:20:10,312
最好也知道他们的名字和长相
You know, who they were
and what they were like.

626
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:18,052
纳瓦荷人鸟规矩真多
要干什么?
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit.
What the hell for?

627
01:20:18,727 --> 01:20:20,786
向他们致敬
To honor them.

628
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:23,563
纪念他们
Their memory.

629
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:29,330
那不是你的错,乔伊
你是听命行事
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe.
You were just followin' orders.

630
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:31,967
是啊
Yeah.

631
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:34,974
我是他妈的杰出陆战队
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

632
01:20:38,613 --> 01:20:40,979
所以派这个任务给我
That's why they gave me this detail.

633
01:20:45,654 --> 01:20:47,349
是喔
Yeah.

634
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:50,120
我是他妈的杰出陆战队
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

635
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:21,718
乔伊  怎么
- Joe!
- What?

636
01:21:27,128 --> 01:21:29,392
你他妈的,乔伊恩得斯
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

637
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:30,963
没错
Really.

638
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:49,650
不要想太多
It's all right.

639
01:21:50,752 --> 01:21:53,186
来,乔伊,我扶你
Come on, Joe. I got you.

640
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:15,501
干什么?
What the fuck?

641
01:23:20,642 --> 01:23:24,078
我没醉死,亚吉,别乱整
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee.
You cut that horseshit out.

642
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:56,935
“塔那帕村第二侦查队”

643
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,076
什么时候抵达村庄？
What's your expected arrival
to the village? Over.

644
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:03,646
大约1500，空军侦查报告
Around 1500. Aerial Reconnaissance
reports

645
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:05,309
没有活动，好像蛮安全的
 no movement, looks secure.

646
01:24:05,453 --> 01:24:07,614
要求热食与信件，完毕
Request hot chow and mailif possible.
Over.

647
01:24:09,324 --> 01:24:13,522
混合草莓与这瑞典玩意儿
就成了优酪乳
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in
this Swedish concoction called yoghurt.

648
01:24:13,628 --> 01:24:16,256
所幸美国人会自创口味
God willin', America
will develop the taste.

649
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:21,393
战后你想干嘛,查理?
What about you, Charlie? What's life
got in store for you after this mess?

650
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:25,769
奇克拿来当女朋友的绵羊?
Sheep? As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?

651
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:31,377
查理家的羊群是四州最多的
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock
in the Four Corners area.

652
01:24:31,513 --> 01:24:33,447
不是盖的?
No shit?

653
01:24:34,215 --> 01:24:37,514
-你是富翁嘛,白马
-还好啦
- You a rich man, Whitehorse?
- We do OK.

654
01:24:37,652 --> 01:24:41,986
我要成立计程车队
那是我致富的秘诀
Taxis. A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em.
That's how I'm making my millions.

655
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:45,957
然后我要回到我的故乡
And then I'm goin' back
to the motherland.

656
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:49,086
在圣多里尼峭壁盖栋别墅
I'm gonna build myself a villa
on the cliffs of Santorini.

657
01:24:49,264 --> 01:24:52,461
圣多里尼,哇,奢华
Ah, Santorini, my friends - that's living.

658
01:24:53,601 --> 01:24:56,764
不错,你呢,吉?
Sounds nice. What about you, Zee?

659
01:24:57,539 --> 01:24:59,370
我考虑去教书
Thinkin' about teaching.

660
01:24:59,507 --> 01:25:03,637
引进新知识到保育区
Ah, teaching. Bring a little something
back to the reservation?

661
01:25:03,778 --> 01:25:08,738
事实上,是将保育区的知识
介绍给全世界
Actually, more interested in bringing

希望能到大学教美国历史

664

665

迁徙三千哩又怎么说?
And what about Kit Carson, and what
they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?

666
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:25,598
没读过吧,奇克?
You ever read about that, Chick?

667
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:28,234
一定没有
Didn't think so.

668
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:31,637
你呢,乔伊?
How about you, Joe?

669
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,336
-什么?
-战后你想干嘛?
- What?
- What are you doin' after this mess?

670
01:25:35,477 --> 01:25:37,411
战争总是会结束的
It's gotta end sometime.

671
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:44,312
亲爱的乔伊,今天有个好消息

罗斯福总统宣布取消

the end of blackouts on Hawaii.

673
01:25:49,224 --> 01:25:51,784
本以为遥遥无期
We thought the day would never come.

674
01:25:52,827 --> 01:25:56,957
10点仍有宵禁但影响不到我
There's still a ten o'clock curfew,
but it doesn't matter to me.

675
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:02,363
值班12小时后
累得只有精力写信
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired
to do anything but write letters.

676

真正感觉到战况不错
战争随时都有可能结束了
There is a real sense that the war
is going well, and could be over soon.

677
01:26:12,747 --> 01:26:17,241
越来越想你
你到底是死是活呢?
I think about you more and more.
If you're alive or dead out there.

678
01:26:18,586 --> 01:26:22,716
我每天查信
心想迟早会有答案
I check the mailevery day, knowing
there's going to be an answer.

679
01:26:22,857 --> 01:26:25,189
你有收到我的信吗,乔伊?
Are you reading these, Joe?

680
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:27,661
听到我的话吗?
Are you listening?

681

-左翼没有危险
-这区没有危险

做好防御工事
Set up defense positions.

683
01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:40,333
奇克,负责扎营
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.

684
01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:42,204
哈利
Harri.

685
01:27:37,732 --> 01:27:39,063
怎么回事？
What's wrong?

686
01:27:40,068 --> 01:27:41,558
好痛
I'm hurting.

687
01:27:47,842 --> 01:27:50,174
这里有些止痛药
Here's some pain reliever.

688
01:28:03,691 --> 01:28:05,921
别担心，你没事
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

689
01:28:11,599 --> 01:28:12,793
谢谢，大叔
Thank you, Uncle.

690
01:28:32,654 --> 01:28:35,418
听起来蛮有感觉的
That's startin' to sound like something.

691
01:29:23,871 --> 01:29:25,998
不晓得你是个艺术家
I didn't know you were an artist.

692
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:28,238
随便涂鸦
Oh, it's stupid.

693
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:33,678
小时候常在祖母厨房桌上画
It's just something I would do as a kid
on my grandmother's kitchen table.

694
01:29:34,215 --> 01:29:36,115
很不错
Well, it's nice.

695
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:38,184
你信天主教?
You Catholic?

696
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:42,689
以前啦
I used to be.

697
01:29:44,258 --> 01:29:47,318
正好想起受坚信礼的事
I was thinkin' about
when they confirmed me.

698
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:50,829
八岁那年,他们帮我抹圣水
I was eight, and they anointed me
with the holy water.

699
01:29:50,965 --> 01:29:53,058
我还记得
And I remember...

700
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:57,828
他们说我是基督的战士
they told me I was a soldier of Christ.

701
01:30:01,676 --> 01:30:05,442
不晓得什么时候迷失了自己
I guess somewhere along the way
I must have switched units.

702
01:30:07,749 --> 01:30:09,683
是油
It's oil.

703
01:30:11,686 --> 01:30:14,951
坚信礼不用水,是用油
They don't use holy water to confirm.
They use oil.

704
01:30:15,923 --> 01:30:17,948
我家也信天主教
I was raised Catholic too.

705
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:20,958
上保育区内的教会学校
Mission school on the reservation.

706
01:30:21,996 --> 01:30:26,194
神父作弥撒时
不喜欢我们说纳瓦荷语
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us
talking Navajo at Mass.

707
01:30:27,769 --> 01:30:30,169
有个礼拜天我忘记了
Of course, one Sunday I forgot.

708
01:30:31,672 --> 01:30:35,699
被处罚绑在地下室的暖炉上
They punished me by tying me
to the radiator in the basement.

709
01:30:35,843 --> 01:30:37,777
整整两天
For two days.

710
01:30:39,413 --> 01:30:41,074
记得我当时也是八岁
I think I was eight too.

711
01:30:42,049 --> 01:30:46,479
现在可以自由说纳瓦荷语了
Well, they're sure
lettin' you talk Navajo now.
Yeah.

712
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:58,229
战争结束后
或许你该来看看纳瓦荷村
You know, when this is over, maybe
you should come out to Navajo country.

713
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,931
纪念碑河谷很美,很幽静
Monument Valley is a beautiful place.
It's peaceful.

714
01:31:03,538 --> 01:31:06,837
可以尝试军队里没有的东西
You know, we could do some things
that you don't do in the Corps.

715
01:31:06,974 --> 01:31:12,469
比如骑马,吃炸面包,打猎
Like ride horses, eat fry bread,
do some hunting...

716
01:31:15,316 --> 01:31:17,250
骑马
Horses.

717
01:31:22,423 --> 01:31:25,859
再说啦
到亚历桑那有好长一段路
I don't know.
It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.

718
01:31:25,993 --> 01:31:29,656
很值得,你可以看看我儿子
But it might be worth it.
You know, you could meet my son.

719
01:31:30,331 --> 01:31:32,822
他也可以见见乔伊恩得斯
And he could meet Joe Enders,

720
01:31:33,768 --> 01:31:38,171
保护他瘦弱老爸的恩人
the guy who watched
over Daddy's scrawny ass.

721
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:45,210
你一定是个好父亲,班
You must be a very good father, Ben.

722
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:51,074
班?你以前不曾这样叫我
Ben. You know,
you've never called me that before.

723
01:31:53,087 --> 01:31:56,579
恩得斯是哪一国名字?
Enders. What kind of name
is that anyway?

724
01:31:57,291 --> 01:32:02,729
意大利,原本叫恩卓菲尼
被艾利斯岛移民局简化了
It's Italian. Used to be Endrolfini before
some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it.

725
01:32:04,932 --> 01:32:08,163
上尉要发一封密码信到司令部
Captain needs to code a message
back to command post.

726
01:32:08,302 --> 01:32:09,792
你就是那个印地安人?
You the Indian?

727
01:32:09,937 --> 01:32:12,167
是的,我是那个印地安人
Yeah, I'm the Indian.

只要几分钟,马上送你回来
It's just a few minutes' drive.
We'll get you back in no time.

729
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:44,998
-我有话跟你说,枪头
-等我一下
- I need to speak with you, Gunny.

今天寄来的,吃过腌鲱鱼吗?
Got this with the mailtoday.
You ever had pickled herring?

731
01:32:51,746 --> 01:32:53,680
我想调职
I need out.

732
01:32:54,282 --> 01:32:56,773
你在说什么?
What the hell are you talkin' about?

733
01:32:56,918 --> 01:32:58,852
目前的职务
This detail.

734
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,311

735

我无法执行
I can't do it.

736
01:33:04,025 --> 01:33:06,186
我需要你,恩得斯
Well, I need you, Enders.

737
01:33:06,327 --> 01:33:08,989
你救过很多同胞的命
Yeah. You've been saving
a lot of marines.

我要调职
I'm requesting mast with
battalion commander. I want out.

739

谁不想调职
Oh, yeah? You and me and every
other mother's son. We all want out.

740
01:33:24,845 --> 01:33:28,542
只要东条英机和希特勒不死
Well, as long as there's
a Tojo and a Hitler out there

741
01:33:28,683 --> 01:33:31,709
我们就得继续战,懂吗?
we have to keep on fighting.
Is that understood?

742
01:33:33,287 --> 01:33:36,415
-你误会了
-我听得一清二楚
- You're not hearing me.

现在全世界都在打仗
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide,

744
01:33:40,361 --> 01:33:43,728
没空理会你的需求和愿望

on your wants and wishes.

745
01:33:43,864 --> 01:33:46,458

Now you get some sack time.
That's an order.

746

留他活口
Don't kill him.

他很重要
He's important.

我们需要拷问他
We need to interrogate him.

我找不到公牛和白马
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.

774
01:41:27,445 --> 01:41:29,310
你有看到他们吗?
Have you seen them?

775
01:41:30,715 --> 01:41:32,478
他在那里
He's over there.

776
01:41:36,087 --> 01:41:37,884
噢,天啊
Oh, shit...

777
01:41:57,175 --> 01:42:00,941
这里不是应该很安全吗?
怎么回事?
This was supposed to be a secured area!
What happened?

778
01:42:04,449 --> 01:42:06,781
我杀了他

779
01:42:07,752 --> 01:42:09,811
你什么?
You... you what?

我用手榴弹
丢过去把他炸个粉碎
I took my grenade and...
and I threw it and I blew him up.

781
01:42:23,968 --> 01:42:26,232

我们会表扬他的功绩
We heard about Whitehorse, Yahzee. We
shall honor his name and his memory.

791
01:43:31,636 --> 01:43:33,570
再会，查理再会
Farewell, Charlie, farewell.

792
01:43:34,572 --> 01:43:37,871
是的，查理再会
Yes, Charlie, farewell.

793
01:43:51,222 --> 01:43:54,953
你知道,白马…救过我一命
You know, Whitehorse...
he saved my bacon.

794
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:02,627
不知道乔治卡斯特会怎么想
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer
would make of that.

795
01:44:05,436 --> 01:44:10,669
记得祖父以前坐在廊下
讲猎印地安人的事
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on
the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians,

796
01:44:10,808 --> 01:44:13,902
讲得简直像猎地鼠一般
like he was talkin'
about gophers or somethin'.

797
01:44:15,313 --> 01:44:19,340
猎一个赚三块美金
About gettin' paid three dollars
per Comanche ear.

798
01:44:21,419 --> 01:44:23,944
我知道很难想像
I know. Gets you thinkin'.

799
01:44:25,823 --> 01:44:31,227
再过50年,或许我们
跟日本人会变成朋友
Another 50 years, who knows, we could
be sittin' down with the Nipponese.

800
01:44:31,362 --> 01:44:34,593
喝着清酒,随意哈拉
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit...

801
01:44:36,867 --> 01:44:39,495
聊看看还可以打谁
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.

802
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,139
你想太多了
You think too much.

803
01:44:49,347 --> 01:44:51,907
第一次有人这样称赞我
First time I ever been accused of that.

804
01:44:59,624 --> 01:45:02,991
“海陆第八营第二侦察连
塞班岛”

805
01:45:54,578 --> 01:45:58,309
告诉过你别一个人到处晃
Thought I told you not to go
traipsing around on your own.

806
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:10,525
你知道,查理祝福过我儿子
出生时,以纳瓦荷传统方式
You know, Charlie blessed my son
in the Navajo way the day he was born.

807
01:46:17,601 --> 01:46:20,900
他曾怀疑老美会保护我们
He wondered about cowboys
watching Indians' backs.

808
01:46:21,639 --> 01:46:24,005
老是感觉不对劲
Something about it didn't seem right.

809
01:46:24,775 --> 01:46:27,642
我觉得查理只是多心
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.

810
01:46:29,046 --> 01:46:34,143
他其实一点都不想来打仗
是我说服他的
He didn't even want to come
to this damn war. I talked him into it.

811
01:46:38,355 --> 01:46:40,084
或许你错了
Maybe you made a mistake.

812
01:46:51,635 --> 01:46:53,830
大家可能都错了
Maybe we all did.

813
01:46:55,072 --> 01:46:56,937
我只是奉命行事,班
I was following orders, Ben.

814
01:46:58,275 --> 01:47:00,937
我奉命保护密码
My orders were to protect the code.

815
01:47:01,812 --> 01:47:07,375
如果你们其中一人被补
一旦密,密码就没用了
If one of you got caught, talked,
the code would be useless.

816
01:47:14,959 --> 01:47:16,984
我只是奉命行事,班
I was following orders, Ben.

817
01:47:20,164 --> 01:47:24,624
当然是,乔伊
你是他妈的杰出军人
Course you were, Joe.
You're a damn good fuckin' marine.

818
01:47:40,184 --> 01:47:42,209
海盗要找你
The Viking wants to see you.

819
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:45,245
他说马上
He says right away.

820
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:55,522
跟大伙说明一下怎么回事
I want you to brief everybody,
make clear what's happenin'.

821
01:47:55,699 --> 01:47:58,361
我打头阵没问题,枪头
All right. Got no problem
with point, Gunny.

822
01:47:58,435 --> 01:47:58,696
我打头阵没问题,枪头
All right. Got no problem
with point, Gunny.

823
01:48:00,671 --> 01:48:01,865
Yeah.

824
01:48:02,006 --> 01:48:06,136
第八营已经出发了
我们要迎头赶上,领先他们
The 8th is moving out already
and we need to be ahead of 'em.

825
01:48:06,243 --> 01:48:10,043
目标是那边那块巨石
The destination is that big piece of rock
you see over there.

826
01:48:10,181 --> 01:48:13,514
这个岛的最后防御据点
The last defensible ridge on this island.

827
01:48:13,651 --> 01:48:18,281
攻下那山头
塞班几乎就是我们的了
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount,
Saipan is pretty much ours.

828
01:48:22,092 --> 01:48:26,153
昨天轰炸机
把山头炸得差不多了
Yesterday, bombers
beat the shit out of that rock.

829
01:48:26,564 --> 01:48:30,796
上面很紧张,可能遭到顽抗
The brass is nervous. They expected
more resistance over there.

830
01:48:31,802 --> 01:48:34,327
要我们过去查看一下
Now they want us to go over
and check it out.

831
01:48:35,472 --> 01:48:37,997
他们要我们去哪里?
So where the hell they got us now?

832
01:48:38,142 --> 01:48:40,007
翻上山头
Goin' up the mountain.

833
01:48:40,477 --> 01:48:42,741
偷窥一下
Have ourselves a little peek.

834
01:48:44,949 --> 01:48:48,612
要密码战士打头阵是有原因的
That codetalker is out front for a reason.

835
01:48:49,153 --> 01:48:51,587
他正好派上用场
That's exactly where I need him to be.

836
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:55,486
假如你俩之间有嫌隙
If there's still a problem
between the two of you,

837
01:48:55,626 --> 01:48:59,221
最好现在立刻摆平
I would like to straighten that out,
right here, right now.

838
01:49:01,332 --> 01:49:03,892
-我没事的,枪头
-好极了
- No problem here, Gunny.
- That's good.

839
01:49:04,735 --> 01:49:06,828
但我还有一个问题
But there's still one here.

840
01:49:08,405 --> 01:49:11,067
你只须做你该做的事
You just do what you're
supposed to do, Sergeant.

841
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:13,233
不多也不少
Nothing more, nothing less.

842
01:49:19,516 --> 01:49:21,450
恩得斯
Enders.

843
01:49:22,653 --> 01:49:24,814
恩得斯,又一封你的信
You got another letter.

844
01:50:30,187 --> 01:50:32,018
不要动!
Freeze!

845
01:50:43,133 --> 01:50:46,967
要命!我们站在地雷区中央!
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle
of a goddamn minefield!

846
01:50:47,104 --> 01:50:49,629
奇克会带我们脱离的,是吧?
Chick's gonna get us out. Right, Chick?

847
01:50:50,474 --> 01:50:52,408
当然
Sure I am.

848
01:50:54,111 --> 01:50:56,204
跟着奇克排一纵队
One line after Chick.

849
01:51:01,085 --> 01:51:03,019
帕帕斯
Pappas.

850
01:51:05,155 --> 01:51:06,952
帕帕斯
Pappas.

851
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:10,092
走呀,希腊人
Move, Greek.

852
01:51:10,694 --> 01:51:13,356
我的蛋蛋会被炸个粉碎!
I'm gonna get my fuckin' balls
blown off out here!

853
01:51:20,838 --> 01:51:22,772
亚吉,站住!
Yahzee! Stop!

854
01:51:44,862 --> 01:51:46,796
躲开!
Move out!

855
01:52:26,537 --> 01:52:27,970
亚吉
Yahzee!

856
01:52:46,223 --> 01:52:48,282
射得好,帕帕斯
Nice shootin', Pap.

857
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:11,240
第八营进来了,查看另一边
The 8th's movin' in.
We'd better check out the other side.

858
01:53:11,381 --> 01:53:13,406
了解,你还好吧?
Got it. You all right?

859
01:53:14,284 --> 01:53:18,050
奇克负责左翼,恩得斯到右翼
我们会用榴弹炮掩护你们
Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right.
We'll cover you with a 30.

860
01:53:18,188 --> 01:53:19,849
-就位
-好了吗?
- On it.
- All right?

861
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:22,083
好,走吧!
OK, let's go!

862
01:53:22,426 --> 01:53:23,358
出发!
Move!

863
01:53:44,414 --> 01:53:46,575
贺玛斯德!
Hjelmstad!

864
01:53:46,717 --> 01:53:48,981
-快帮他!
-枪头!
- Help him up!
- Gunny!

865
01:53:52,623 --> 01:53:54,557
快
Come on. Come on.

866
01:54:06,603 --> 01:54:09,333
-天啊
-乔伊!
- Christ.
- Joe! Joe!

867
01:54:11,708 --> 01:54:13,403
撕开衣服
Tear him open.

868
01:54:14,411 --> 01:54:16,379
要来点吗啡吗?
You want morphine?

869
01:54:16,513 --> 01:54:18,174
-要来点吗啡吗?
-好
- You want morphine?
- Yeah.

870
01:54:22,486 --> 01:54:24,511
你不会有事的,长官
You'll be all right, sir.

871
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:30,217
可恶!亚吉,过来!
Goddamn it, Yahzee, get over here!

872
01:54:31,161 --> 01:54:32,492
干!
Fuck!

873
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:36,490
奇克,看着他
Chick... Stay with him.

874
01:54:39,069 --> 01:54:40,195
有我在
I got ya.

875
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,993
我叫你照顾枪头
I told you to stay with Gunny.

876
01:56:19,636 --> 01:56:21,467
枪头挂了
Gunny's gone.

877
01:56:41,491 --> 01:56:44,483
我们出不去了,对不对?
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we, Joe?

878
01:56:46,096 --> 01:56:48,462
我快没弹药了,乔伊
I'm runnin' out of ammo here, Joe.

879
01:56:52,336 --> 01:56:54,770
我不想死在这S坑里
I don't wanna die in this shithole.

880
01:56:58,308 --> 01:57:00,401
你不会死的
You're not gonna die.

881
01:57:03,013 --> 01:57:04,878
不会有人死的
Nobody else is gonna die.

882
01:57:14,758 --> 01:57:19,195
我们会活着
我们会活着出去
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it out of here.

883
01:57:19,262 --> 01:57:19,557
我们会活着
我们会活着出去
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it out of here.

884
01:58:26,263 --> 01:58:30,495
第八营被困在空地
我们必须请求空中支援
8th's caught out in the open.
We gotta call in the flyboys.

885
01:58:34,938 --> 01:58:37,463
我去拿那个无线电,掩护我
I'm gonna get that radio. Cover me.

886
01:59:07,037 --> 01:59:09,096
无线电被他拿走了,亚吉!
He got the radio, Yahzee!

887
01:59:40,437 --> 01:59:42,302
掩护我,我去了!
Cover me! I'm going!

888
01:59:45,809 --> 01:59:47,970
退回去!
Stay back!

889
02:00:01,258 --> 02:00:02,782
王八蛋!
Fuckers!

890
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:56,210
救不回你朋友的
It won't bring your friends back.

891
02:00:59,316 --> 02:01:01,477
你懂什么叫朋友?
What do you know about friends?

892
02:01:42,225 --> 02:01:44,420
快呼叫空中支援
Get us some air support!

893
02:01:58,441 --> 02:02:01,501
白鲍威,红卡森呼叫
亚历桑那
Bowie White, this is Carson Red, Arizona.

894
02:02:01,645 --> 02:02:03,909
重复,红卡森呼叫,亚历桑那
I say again, Carson Red, Arizona.

895
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,483

2-20,麦克,36
Two-twenty, Mike, three-six.

897
02:02:27,637 --> 02:02:27,864
好,走吧
All right, let's go.

898
02:02:31,141 --> 02:02:33,405
我们要杀出重围
We're gonna make it outta here.

899
02:03:08,678 --> 02:03:10,578
可恶,乔伊
Damn it, Joe.

900
02:03:13,650 --> 02:03:15,584
快点动手
Just get it over with.

901
02:03:16,686 --> 02:03:18,620
闭嘴,班
Shut up, Ben.

902
02:03:38,241 --> 02:03:40,141
动手,乔伊
Do it, Joe.

903
02:03:41,578 --> 02:03:43,478
动手啊!
Do it!

904
02:03:46,316 --> 02:03:48,511
不能再死人了,班
No one else is gonna die, Ben.

905
02:03:52,522 --> 02:03:54,251
不会再有人送命了
No one else is dying.

906
02:05:21,811 --> 02:05:23,711
乔伊,我们成功了
Joe, we did it.

907
02:05:25,381 --> 02:05:27,144
老天…
God...

908
02:05:28,117 --> 02:05:29,744
老天
God!

909
02:05:30,453 --> 02:05:33,286
Oh, God... Oh, Joe...

910
02:05:48,538 --> 02:05:51,098
我们今天救了不少海陆弟兄
We saved a lot of marines today.

911
02:05:55,111 --> 02:05:57,102
是啊,班
Yeah, we did, Ben.

912
02:06:03,486 --> 02:06:05,317
查理…
Charlie...

913
02:06:05,722 --> 02:06:08,054
你知道我不想杀他的
You know I didn't want to.

914
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:12,889
对吧?
Right?

915
02:06:24,173 --> 02:06:26,368
圣母玛丽亚
Hail... HailMary...

916
02:06:26,509 --> 02:06:28,067
万福
full of grace...

917
02:06:28,244 --> 02:06:29,541
our...

918
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:32,510
天主与同在
our Lord is with thee...

919
02:06:41,324 --> 02:06:44,418
圣母玛丽亚,上帝之母
Holy Mary, mother of God...

920
02:06:46,029 --> 02:06:47,963
保佑我们
pray for us...

921
02:06:56,606 --> 02:06:58,904
我干掉最后一个了,乔伊
I got the last of 'em, Joe.

922
02:08:26,963 --> 02:08:29,158
他名叫乔伊恩得斯
His name was Joe Enders...

923
02:08:29,866 --> 02:08:32,096
南费城人
from South Philadelphia.

924
02:08:32,935 --> 02:08:34,994
他是个英勇的战士
He was a fierce warrior.

925
02:08:36,873 --> 02:08:38,773
是优秀海军陆战队
A good marine.

926
02:08:48,684 --> 02:08:51,983
如果你要说他的故事,乔治
If you ever tell a story about him,
George...

927
02:08:53,623 --> 02:08:55,784
就说他是我的朋友
say he was my friend.

928
02:09:30,193 --> 02:09:37,099
“纳瓦荷密码是塞班胜利的关键
太平洋区主要战役也靠它”
The Navajo Code was vital
in the victory at Saipan
and every major battle in the Pacific.

929

“纳瓦荷密码是塞班胜利的关键
太平洋区主要战役也靠它
这套密码始终未被破解”
The Navajo Code was vital
in the victory at Saipan
and every major battle in the Pacific
It was never broken.
