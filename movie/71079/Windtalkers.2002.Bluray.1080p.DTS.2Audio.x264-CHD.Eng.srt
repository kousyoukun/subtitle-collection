1
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,518
Charlie!

2
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,324
I wasn't so sure you'd be on the bus.

3
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:30,665
Didn't want your white brothers
thinking you were the best we had.

4
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:19,031
SOLOMON ISLANDS

5
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:33,949
Watch out!

6
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,115
My hand!

7
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,607
Goddamn!

8
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:08,242
We're running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.

9
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:17,483
Move!

10
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:33,927
Come on!

11
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:39,030
Come on, you can do it! Come on!

12
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:59,485
We got nothin', Enders!
We're out of ammo!

13
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:04,053
Joe... Nobody else needs to die.
We can go! We can get outta here!

14
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,769
We got orders!

15
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:15,431
They told us to hold the position!
And that's what we're gonna do!

16
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,508
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!

17
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,179
Come on!

18
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:38,056
Get down!

19
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,486
Tommy.

20
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,562
Goddamn you!

21
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,199
Oh, no! No!

22
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,542
- Bill!
- I'm out.

23
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,114
Come on! Come on!

24
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,466
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.

25
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,998
No... No!

26
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:42,766
No!

27
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,443
Raise your right hand.

28
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,146
- I... State your full name...
- l, Ben Yahzee...

29
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:04,547
CAMP PENDLETON, CALIFORNIA

30
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,450
...do solemnly swear to support and
defend the constitution of the US...

31
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,860
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

32
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,693
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

33
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,290
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me
the code word for "tank"?

34
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,097
Come on. You boys
wanna be codetalkers.

35
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,006
Show me some brains. Think!

36
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,572
What do we call a tank?

37
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:40,341
Chay-da-gahi.

38
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,819
Tortoise. Good.

39
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:50,283
Artillery. Code word?

40
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,220
In code. Private Whitehorse.

41
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,990
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?

42
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,526
Very good.

43
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,569
Japanese Zero. Code word?

44
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,029
KANEOHE BAY US NAVAL HOSPITAL

45
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:42,698
We can go! We can get outta here!

46
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,891
They told us to hold the position!

47
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,703
Nice day, huh?

48
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,109
Joe?

49
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,514
Joe.

50
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,485
Didn't hear a word, did you?

51
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:28,226
That's what happens to a man
when he's talking to a beautiful woman.

52
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,530
It happens when you're
not watching my lips, Joe.

53
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:38,831
Watch this.

54
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:01,816
You're a mess, Joe.
You're not fooling anybody.

55
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:04,291
No, Rita. He's a mess.

56
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:08,321
I'm getting better every day.

57
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,629
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium's all screwy.

58
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,759
You can't go back to war
if you can't stand up.

59
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:19,794
Let's go, marines. This war
ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.

60
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,267
Joe...

61
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:45,422
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?

62
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,988
Somebody's gotta keep
the WAVES company.

63
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,693
Are you gonna help me or not?

64
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,625
Marked improvement.

65
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:52,663
And his left ear is the worse of the two?

66
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,819
It's... amazing.

67
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,559
TBYhasn't got the range of the TBX.

68
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:33,220
So you may need a relay to get
your transmission to command post.

69
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:37,633
But what it really comes down to
is speed and accuracy under pressure.

70
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:40,766
Transcribe now.

71
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,637
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.

72
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:54,242
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!

73
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,512
We're losing men.

74
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,848
I need this message decrypted.

75
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:09,885
"Request fire support. We have target
at one-one-niner, Baker one-five."

76
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:12,987
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will."

77
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:20,426
Beginner's luck.

78
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:51,482
You're up, mac.

79
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:59,221
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.

80
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,566
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.

81
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,798
Better than you did as a civilian.

82
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:16,174
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.

83
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:21,681
Assault and battery...
on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

84
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:25,376
A priest?

85
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:30,218
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan
High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.

86
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,586
Public-school boy myself.

87
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,350
Some minor problems in boot.

88
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:41,055
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.

89
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,661
And you made a hell of a stand
on the Solomons.

90
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,827
Tough bit of business there, huh?

91
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,197
Pretty tough, sir.

92
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,571
But you're prepared
to jump right back into it?

93
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:54,502
Yes, sir. Very much so.

94
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,935
Very much so.

95
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:00,636
Well...

96
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:07,214
The Japs have pretty much busted
every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.

97
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:10,344
You men on the Solomons
were lost to a broken code.

98
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:15,052
Tell me something. You ever
run into any Indians on the Solomons?

99
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:18,182
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.

100
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:22,928
The Corps has developed a new code
based on their language.

101
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:24,929
It's had quite an impact.

102
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:29,093
So much so the navy have decided
to go to great lengths to protect it.

103
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,393
That's why you're here.

104
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:35,593
You're to pair with one of them,
keep his ass safe.

105
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:38,902
Your job is to keep him alive
so he can do his job.

106
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:43,310
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,

107
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,347
not baby-sitting some Indian.

108
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:48,280
Enders, we didn't pick
your name out of a hat.

109
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,006
We need good marines.

110
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:53,715
That's why you're standing here.

111
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,619
Take a look.

112
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,849
It's a Navajo. Or it was.

113
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:02,859
Tortured to death by Japanese
intelligence trying to bust our code.

114
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:06,417
Fortunately, he couldn't help them
even if he wanted to.

115
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:10,124
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.

116
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:13,826
Code's based on their language,
but it is still a code.

117
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:18,904
Tojo would like nothing more
than to catch a live one.

118
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,107
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal,
cannot leave this room.

119
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:31,343
Under no circumstances can you allow
your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.

120
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,307
Your mission is to protect the code...

121
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,010
at all costs.

122
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:42,246
You understand me?

123
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,690
Yes, sir, I do.

124
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:48,456
Good.

125
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:51,156
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.

126
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,666
Keep those hands vertical.

127
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,729
Way to go, marine.

128
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:54,644
Fortino, take over.

129
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,738
Hey... That was you, right,
sitting in front of the major's office?

130
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:03,080
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.

131
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:07,818
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.

132
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:12,051
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.

133
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:15,189
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

134
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:21,606
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

135
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:21,969
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

136
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,269
No fuckin' idea, mac.

137
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:27,399
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

138
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,444
I've never seen so many white men.

139
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:39,917
They've never seen so many Navajo.

140
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,448
Looks to me like you got to see
a little action there.

141
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,188
Me too.

142
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:52,593
Jap sons of bitches
shot me right in the ass.

143
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:55,859
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.

144
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:04,836
So, your duty with JASCO have anything
to do with these Navajo radiomen?

145
00:21:07,274 --> 00:21:09,399
I'm not at liberty to say.

146
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:14,108
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.

147
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:20,644
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell
me are the same orders I can't tell you.

148
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:22,412
Hell of a thing, huh?

149
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:25,145
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.

150
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:26,686
Yeah.

151
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,019
They look pretty normal, I guess.

152
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:35,458
Expecting them to wear war paint?

153
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:42,699
Maybe we ought to go introduce
ourselves. They look a little lost to me.

154
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:46,460
Henderson.

155
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,228
I wouldn't get too friendly.

156
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:57,034
How!

157
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,278
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.

158
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:01,109
Whitehorse.

159
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,114
This is Yahzee. Ben.

160
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,242
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

161
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:11,585
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?

162
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:52,679
Mind if I join you?

163
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:57,221
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.

164
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,854
How you doin'?

165
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:02,721
You're blocking my view.

166
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:07,922
Oh, sorry.

167
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:12,699
What do they call this crap anyway?

168
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,828
Marines call it chow.

169
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:20,368
Well, there's a propaganda effort.

170
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:32,782
Sorry. You can have mine.

171
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,414
Shit.

172
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,749
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?

173
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:47,091
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.

174
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:50,487
Hold this.

175
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:09,940
Shit.

176
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,083
How's your white man?

177
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,509
Hungry.

178
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,622
I'm in for a couple more.

179
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,356
You writing to your son?

180
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,425
Tell him I say hello.

181
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,960
Pair of cowboys for Big E.

182
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:47,873
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.

183
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,002
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.

184
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,339
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.

185
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:57,810
All right.

186
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:01,409
OK... Oh, another mess
for the Sunshine State.

187
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:04,045
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.

188
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:06,850
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.

189
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,187
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.

190
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,159
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.

191
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:14,884
Call.

192
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:17,020
We all got thumbs up our asses.

193
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:22,294
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy
in Intel that says we ship out in a week.

194
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,392
I been hearing "next week" for a month.

195
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,370
I didn't know you knew
anybody in Intelligence, Harri.

196
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:31,370
Next year'd be all right with me.

197
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,969
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.

198
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:38,845
Full boat, baby.

199
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:41,211
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.

200
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:44,184
Oh, Jesus!

201
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,243
Ouch. Ouch.

202
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:50,747
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.

203
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:54,155
God knows what a girl will do
without reassurance.

204
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:56,849
Son of a bitch.

205
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:01,364
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats
opening up. You wanna come join us?

206
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,992
Are you serious?

207
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:09,629
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?

208
00:26:09,705 --> 00:26:13,264
Card on the head,
only fool can't see it is you.

209
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,035
You want to come on over, or what?

210
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:23,304
Cut me in.

211
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:31,450
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

212
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:35,215
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

213
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:37,084
Hey, don't let him scare you.

214
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:42,284
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's
like any other. Waste of time and money.

215
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:46,458
Well, ante up... Chief.

216
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:49,187
How'd you know I was a chief?

217
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:52,529
You must've seen me showering
with my war bonnet.

218
00:27:05,544 --> 00:27:09,239
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.

219
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,303
Beautiful.

220
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:38,524
All right, then.

221
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:41,001
Orders finally came through.

222
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:44,197
We ship out tomorrow morning.

223
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:54,305
Destination: the island of Saipan,

224
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:59,715
which is one of the stepping stones
we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.

225
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:03,451
It's of strategic importance
that we capture this island.

226
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:06,284
We can get ourselves
an advanced naval base

227
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:09,688
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's

228
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,624
and get our bombers
within range of Tokyo.

229
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:18,925
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil,
and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.

230
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,489
They're gonna fight for every square inch,

231
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:25,230
because it's their home,
but we're gonna take it away from 'em!

232
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,235
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!

233
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:37,040
We're gonna be in front
of the whole damn division.

234
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:39,742
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.

235
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:43,076
We're gonna be
sniffin' out enemy positions,

236
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,050
coordinating the naval gunfire -

237
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,055
exactly what we've been training to do
for the last four months. All right?

238
00:28:57,396 --> 00:29:01,228
Now, we got some new radiomen
from headquarters.

239
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,188
There's a Private Whitehorse...

240
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,028
and Yahzee...

241
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,631
and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson,

242
00:29:16,143 --> 00:29:18,872
who, if I'm understanding
these orders correctly,

243
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:22,277
will be covering our Navajos' asses.

244
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:47,159
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

245
00:29:55,707 --> 00:30:01,007
...but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin'
into our share of the shit nonetheless.

246
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,605
Any questions?

247
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,622
Sounds like you're dying.

248
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,462
These might help get rid of the taste.

249
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:34,935
Charlie and l, we both lost it
on the boat ride from San Diego.

250
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:37,826
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.

251
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:40,531
Life Savers really helped.

252
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,998
You want a Life Saver?

253
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:47,637
What are you doin' here?

254
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,336
Just trying to help.

255
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,111
Not what I meant.

256
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:03,782
You mean what am I doing
in this uniform?

257
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,827
It's my war too, Sergeant.

258
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:10,522
I'm fighting for my country,
for my land, for my people.

259
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:14,288
Not your people I'm worried about.

260
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:18,732
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.

261
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:22,828
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes
to do what used to take an hour.

262
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:26,034
Now, somebody wearing
a lot more stripes than you

263
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:28,542
thinks that's worth something.

264
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:32,409
Remind me to time you when
you got bullets flying over your head.

265
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,680
What the hell's wrong with you?

266
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:52,457
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

267
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:56,156
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!

268
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:04,497
From the halls of Montezuma

269
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:08,472
To the shores of Tripoli

270
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:13,239
We will fight our country's battles

271
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:17,006
On the land and on the sea

272
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:21,612
First to fight for right and freedom

273
00:32:21,684 --> 00:32:25,345
And to keep our honor clean

274
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:29,679
We are proud to claim the title

275
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:33,556
Of United States Marines

276
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:51,261
Hi.

277
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,299
How's that ear?

278
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:59,877
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if
it starts aching, take a couple of those.

279
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:02,073
And call me in the morning.

280
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:08,341
You're not gonna be here
in the morning, are you?

281
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:13,415
Shipping out without even
buying me a drink.

282
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,482
Ought to be ashamed of yourself,
hustling a... hustling marines.

283
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:23,430
What's your poison?

284
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:27,490
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I'll get a shot of something.

285
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,126
Rum.

286
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:31,826
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.

287
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:33,898
Make that two.

288
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:35,963
May as well join me, huh?

289
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,768
- Why not?
- OK.

290
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:44,002
Thank you.

291
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:48,008
Well... to war.

292
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,118
THE JAPANESE ISLAND OF SAIPAN
JUNE 16, 1944

293
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:19,070
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

294
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:33,814
Get those men spread out!

295
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,180
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!

296
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:07,915
Come on, keep up!

297
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:15,060
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on!

298
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:37,638
- How am I doin'?
- You're good.

299
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,319
Let's go!

300
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,054
Stay on my ass.

301
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:12,301
I told you to stay on my ass!

302
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:20,647
- Stay low!
- Get out of there!

303
00:38:49,383 --> 00:38:50,815
Go!

304
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:34,509
Get him outta there!

305
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:36,574
Get me outta here!

306
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:43,187
- Hold still, damn it!
- Get him outta there!

307
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:57,194
You sons of bitches!

308
00:40:00,337 --> 00:40:02,166
Fortino! Cover me!

309
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,229
Whitehorse, get down!

310
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,030
Get down!

311
00:40:48,617 --> 00:40:50,481
Pappas!

312
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:57,387
Corpsman!

313
00:40:57,457 --> 00:41:00,084
Helmet goes on your head! Corpsman!

314
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,682
Take care of him.

315
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,420
Put a hand on this.

316
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,532
Tank! Tank! Tank!

317
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,472
You ready? Go! Go!

318
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:36,675
Harrigan, light it up!

319
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,094
Let's go, boys! Keep up the fight!

320
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:07,335
Are you hit? Are you hit?

321
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,044
You're OK. You're good, you're good.

322
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,782
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.

323
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:16,950
- Harri?
- You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy.

324
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:19,352
- Stay low!
- Nellie? Pappas?

325
00:42:19,422 --> 00:42:21,412
Yeah, we're good.

326
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:25,383
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate.

327
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,722
What?

328
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:29,590
I can't breathe when I get excited.

329
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:32,722
Goddamn! Must be hell on your gal!

330
00:42:53,324 --> 00:42:58,349
Enders, get the navy on the horn
and tell 'em to dig out those guns.

331
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:02,427
Target reference... dog one...

332
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:05,091
right 700.

333
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,597
Elevation zero-five-zero.

334
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:17,371
Relay the damn coordinates!

335
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:23,379
Arizona! Arizona!

336
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,823
USS CALIFORNIA

337
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:58,268
It sounds like they're underwater.
Is it English?

338
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,514
Target reference, dog one,

339
00:44:12,585 --> 00:44:16,417
south 700, elevation zero-five-zero.

340
00:44:39,538 --> 00:44:41,266
Right 200!

341
00:44:41,706 --> 00:44:44,606
Up 50. Fire for effect.

342
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,330
Let's go!

343
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,923
Move!

344
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:02,924
Harrigan!

345
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,959
Torch the box!

346
00:46:56,979 --> 00:46:58,638
Kill him!

347
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,155
Goddamn it!

348
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:29,098
Shit.

349
00:47:30,271 --> 00:47:33,466
Nellie. Take the satchel charge.

350
00:47:34,174 --> 00:47:36,299
You hear me? Move!

351
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,541
You're gonna cover me, right?

352
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:46,708
I'll go with you. We flank left.

353
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:49,713
I'll cover you. Smoke and cover.

354
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,776
I can do this.

355
00:47:54,423 --> 00:47:56,413
I can do this.

356
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:08,189
Smoke 'em up!

357
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:15,627
Cover up.

358
00:49:06,912 --> 00:49:08,435
Shit!

359
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:18,343
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!

360
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:28,391
Heads up around 0500.

361
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:32,020
You're going to have replacements
and ammo coming up. Over.

362
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:35,457
Roger. Make sure
they have the new password.

363
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:37,898
Challenge: "Wind." Answer: "Talkers."

364
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:41,368
That's what one of our Navajo brothers
calls us. What do you think? Over.

365
00:49:42,405 --> 00:49:48,205
"Windtalkers," I like it. OK, Kemo Sabe,
keep your butts down tonight. Over.

366
00:49:50,078 --> 00:49:52,705
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?

367
00:49:53,146 --> 00:49:56,602
You are a whiny son of a bitch
right now, aren't you?

368
00:49:58,784 --> 00:50:02,980
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does
that make it on the East Coast?

369
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:05,619
How the fucking hell should I know?

370
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,380
Just seven...

371
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:11,649
It's 8am, Sunday morning.

372
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,161
I hope my side of the bed
didn't get taken up Saturday night.

373
00:50:15,297 --> 00:50:19,356
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer,
you keep worrying about her.

374
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,593
Might get my ass
sent back to Rhody, though.

375
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:26,035
There's plenty of dollies outside
of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty.

376
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:29,334
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.
- Ain't that the truth.

377
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:34,537
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.

378
00:50:34,612 --> 00:50:37,409
This one time, before the war,

379
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:44,441
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little
thing named Molly comes out the water.

380
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:48,418
She walks straight up to me
and asks me if I'm hungry...

381
00:50:49,056 --> 00:50:51,454
cos she's havin' a weenie roast.

382
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:53,424
Shit! Damn.

383
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:55,989
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.

384
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:04,363
Now I'm on Saipan with this
giant Zippo strapped to my back

385
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:06,697
and I'm roastin' human beings.

386
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:16,632
Why I volunteered... beyond me.

387
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:21,235
Damn, I'm proud to be here.

388
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:23,746
My whole family's been in the Corps.

389
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,674
My old man, he's a lifer.

390
00:51:26,985 --> 00:51:29,679
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.

391
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,177
Around the house too.

392
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:38,954
Maybe now he'll back off.

393
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,323
Pappas, I...

394
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:51,994
I want you to do me a favor.

395
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:56,534
If anything should happen to me,

396
00:51:56,607 --> 00:51:59,404
you make sure that my wife gets this.

397
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:04,537
I mean, she picked them out and all.

398
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,971
Don't talk like that, Nell.

399
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:10,876
You don't even joke about shit like that.

400
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:14,816
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.

401
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,892
Hey.

402
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:14,257
Don't thank me till you've tried it.

403
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:16,992
You missed mail call.

404
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:29,433
What the hell are they doin'?

405
00:53:30,242 --> 00:53:33,039
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.

406
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,979
Sounds like some kind of prayer.

407
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,584
Maybe they know our orders.

408
00:54:06,337 --> 00:54:08,269
Think you could do it, Joe?

409
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:10,429
Give it a rest, Henderson.

410
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:14,266
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...

411
00:54:15,776 --> 00:54:17,868
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.

412
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,973
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...

413
00:54:26,918 --> 00:54:29,477
You will make your family proud.

414
00:55:18,824 --> 00:55:21,518
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

415
00:55:21,594 --> 00:55:23,890
Getting on my uniform.

416
00:55:23,962 --> 00:55:27,657
You know the difference
between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

417
00:55:30,401 --> 00:55:32,391
It's that uniform.

418
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:34,958
That's it.

419
00:55:36,505 --> 00:55:38,369
See, I know you people.

420
00:55:38,773 --> 00:55:42,400
I know what kind
of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.

421
00:55:42,742 --> 00:55:45,471
You ought to be careful out here all alone.

422
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:48,202
No baby-sitter.

423
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:50,703
I might just take you for a Jap.

424
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:54,147
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

425
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:57,414
Or keep demonstrating
what an ignorant fool you are?

426
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,754
How's that for an ignorant fool?

427
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,597
Go ahead, try again.

428
00:56:36,183 --> 00:56:38,343
You gonna do somethin'?

429
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,526
Chick! Come on!

430
00:57:01,603 --> 00:57:03,593
Get off me!

431
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,711
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.

432
00:57:25,788 --> 00:57:28,119
Ben? Shit.

433
00:57:30,592 --> 00:57:35,357
I thought he was a Jap. You know,
killed some marine for that uniform.

434
00:57:37,063 --> 00:57:38,995
Sure you did, Chick.

435
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:42,196
Damn Injun looks just like
a Jap, don't he?

436
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:44,257
Look, I'm no damn Injun.

437
00:57:44,902 --> 00:57:49,837
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,
born for the Towering House clan.

438
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:55,601
But you do look like a Nip.

439
00:57:55,678 --> 00:58:00,636
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.

440
00:58:04,517 --> 00:58:06,507
Fuckin' shitbird.

441
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:10,347
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter
all the time, I thought.

442
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:12,321
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.

443
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:19,150
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.

444
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:26,056
Navajo believe, until a body's given
a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.

445
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:30,993
Chindis - that's what
we call evil spirits. Demons.

446
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:36,731
I haven't thought much about it
since I was a kid.

447
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:39,242
Till I saw those dead bodies.

448
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,869
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

449
00:58:41,946 --> 00:58:44,456
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.

450
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:44,820
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.

451
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:47,915
Because your buddy
smeared ash on your forehead?

452
00:58:47,993 --> 00:58:52,291
That's right. Cos my buddy
smeared ash on my forehead.

453
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,130
You ever see ghosts?

454
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:10,774
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.

455
00:59:42,352 --> 00:59:44,342
Sounds beautiful.

456
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,043
You, uh, you self-taught?

457
00:59:47,822 --> 00:59:50,015
My dad was always playing.

458
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:54,119
You know what they say:
if you can't beat 'em...

459
00:59:54,194 --> 00:59:59,459
No shit. My dad, he...
he gave me this thing.

460
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:03,291
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.

461
01:00:03,368 --> 01:00:07,268
Used to bring 'em in for feeding
with this little tune I played.

462
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:11,465
I know I ain't gonna get you
to quit playin' that thing, so...

463
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,904
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...

464
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:16,538
I don't think it's gonna work.

465
01:00:17,979 --> 01:00:21,208
Well, we ain't got much else
to do out here. What the hell?

466
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:24,077
OK.

467
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:27,582
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.

468
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:09,313
2nd Recon Company will move out
at 0600 and scout along road 04.

469
01:01:09,385 --> 01:01:13,012
You can expect light resistance
northwest of the palm grove. Over.

470
01:01:13,955 --> 01:01:18,185
Roger. What do you mean, light?
No resistance is light! Over.

471
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:22,353
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to
question why, ours is but to do or die."

472
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,087
Semper Fi. Over.

473
01:01:35,704 --> 01:01:38,728
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

474
01:01:39,707 --> 01:01:44,266
Or, given that you're not much of a
writer, should I not expect an answer?

475
01:01:44,344 --> 01:01:47,277
The newspapers say
our boys are doing great.

476
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:51,839
But I don't think the reporters
have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.

477
01:01:52,885 --> 01:01:56,011
I found a stray dog
the other day on Waikiki.

478
01:01:56,086 --> 01:01:58,815
I gave him a bath and took him in.

479
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,415
He reminded me of you - but cuter.

480
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,954
At least he keeps me warm at night.

481
01:02:08,096 --> 01:02:12,758
I try not to think about you. About
what might be happening over there.

482
01:02:13,534 --> 01:02:15,762
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,

483
01:02:15,835 --> 01:02:19,200
I can't keep myself
from wondering where you are.

484
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:21,262
How you're doing.

485
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:33,736
What the hell you doin'?

486
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:36,815
Writing a letter to my son.

487
01:02:36,884 --> 01:02:39,476
Forget your orders? No letters out.

488
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,315
Command don't want postmarks
going to the reservation.

489
01:02:48,026 --> 01:02:49,925
Hey! You hear me?

490
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:58,896
I thought that he might read 'em
when I get home.

491
01:03:04,605 --> 01:03:06,697
What's his name?

492
01:03:06,774 --> 01:03:08,706
Your son.

493
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,271
It's George. George Washington.

494
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:15,873
George Washington Yahzee.

495
01:03:17,982 --> 01:03:20,175
It's got a bit of a ring to it.

496
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:23,618
My wife wasn't so sure.

497
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:26,553
She's a little more traditional.

498
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:31,814
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.

499
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:36,555
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.

500
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:42,224
Can I try one of those?

501
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:45,901
- You smoke?
- Not really.

502
01:04:24,734 --> 01:04:27,200
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!

503
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:30,292
Let's go! Let's go!

504
01:04:30,904 --> 01:04:32,871
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

505
01:04:41,313 --> 01:04:43,802
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!

506
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:46,909
Yahzee!

507
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,975
I'm hit!

508
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,315
Take it off! It burns!

509
01:04:56,758 --> 01:04:59,247
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit.

510
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:19,640
- Spread out!
- Move!

511
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:32,523
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.

512
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:34,558
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.

513
01:05:35,693 --> 01:05:39,149
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.

514
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,094
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!

515
01:05:41,165 --> 01:05:45,566
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.

516
01:05:48,471 --> 01:05:51,302
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.

517
01:05:51,372 --> 01:05:52,998
Do somethin'.

518
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:55,562
Shit... Follow me!

519
01:05:55,642 --> 01:05:58,371
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!

520
01:06:20,428 --> 01:06:21,951
God.

521
01:06:44,646 --> 01:06:46,340
Son of a bitch!

522
01:07:08,131 --> 01:07:10,188
I got you, mac!

523
01:07:15,136 --> 01:07:16,965
Corpsman!

524
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,436
Corpsman!

525
01:07:25,844 --> 01:07:27,901
Corpsman!

526
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:31,437
Nellie!

527
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,208
Corpsman!

528
01:08:06,837 --> 01:08:09,093
You were right, Joe.

529
01:08:09,863 --> 01:08:11,618
I do look like a Nip.

530
01:08:11,692 --> 01:08:13,777
What the hell are you talking about?

531
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:18,277
Putting on that Jap uniform. Trying to get
one of their radios, call off our guns.

532
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:21,098
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.

533
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:24,288
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.

534
01:08:24,365 --> 01:08:26,915
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!

535
01:08:30,624 --> 01:08:33,990
He's just a kid! You killed your own!

536
01:08:34,595 --> 01:08:39,327
What's wrong with you?
You killed your own! Sons of bitches!

537
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,396
You killed your own!

538
01:08:57,985 --> 01:09:01,784
- Sure you're up to this?
- Find out soon enough, sir.

539
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:07,854
- What the hell are you doin' there?
- I'm goin' with him.

540
01:09:07,928 --> 01:09:10,191
If that's OK with you.

541
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,556
Give me the rifle.

542
01:09:18,874 --> 01:09:21,137
Horyo-da.

543
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:23,834
It's Jap for prisoner.

544
01:09:24,546 --> 01:09:26,603
Horyo-da.

545
01:09:34,556 --> 01:09:36,613
Horyo-da.

546
01:09:39,562 --> 01:09:41,893
All right, everybody be ready.

547
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:40,783
Horyo-da!

548
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:48,489
Now!

549
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:49,514
Now!

550
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,365
Hit me. Hit me.

551
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:20,210
Please don't hit me!

552
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,263
Yahzee!

553
01:12:10,644 --> 01:12:12,838
Kill him!

554
01:12:18,318 --> 01:12:20,477
Goddamn it, kill him!

555
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,922
Get on the radio!

556
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:40,465
Bowie White, Bowie White,
this is Carson Red!

557
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:46,137
Cease fire! Cease fire!
You're shelling marines!

558
01:12:47,515 --> 01:12:49,504
Sergeant!

559
01:12:51,987 --> 01:12:54,079
Cease fire! Cease fire!

560
01:12:57,192 --> 01:12:59,351
Add 325, fire for effect!

561
01:13:00,595 --> 01:13:04,290
Redirect fire. Add 325, fire for effect.

562
01:13:04,866 --> 01:13:06,889
Let's go!

563
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:11,363
Crank it up! Let's go!

564
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:13,134
Commence fire!

565
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:15,037
Fire!

566
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:22,439
Yeah!

567
01:13:22,518 --> 01:13:24,108
Well, I'll be.

568
01:13:50,914 --> 01:13:52,777
Colonel. Can I help you, sir?

569
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:56,649
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders.
Joseph F Enders.

570
01:13:57,789 --> 01:13:59,618
Enders.

571
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:10,029
Yes, sir.

572
01:14:10,769 --> 01:14:14,033
Report I read claims
you went above and beyond.

573
01:14:15,642 --> 01:14:16,835
Sir?

574
01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:19,308
You've been recommended
for commendation.

575
01:14:19,377 --> 01:14:22,641
And I concur. But I don't see any point
in you having to wait around

576
01:14:22,715 --> 01:14:27,048
for all those formalities
to work themselves out.

577
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,253
Not when I got one of these handy.

578
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:33,424
Congratulations, Enders.

579
01:14:33,493 --> 01:14:35,618
You saved a lot of marines.

580
01:14:44,304 --> 01:14:49,036
I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have
done it without Private Ben Yahzee.

581
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,577
Oh... Right.

582
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,435
The, uh, Indian.

583
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,478
Begging the colonel's pardon,
he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,

584
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:01,577
born for the Towering House clan.

585
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:07,851
Of course. Navajo. Towering House clan.

586
01:15:14,336 --> 01:15:16,565
You keep up the good work, Enders.

587
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:57,610
Send that to Nellie's wife.

588
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:40,922
You ever not miss mail call, Enders?

589
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:50,460
My mom says somebody
takes the time to write a letter,

590
01:16:50,537 --> 01:16:52,766
you should read the letter.

591
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:58,099
Does she let you drink, your mother?

592
01:16:58,712 --> 01:17:01,339
No. But she's not here.

593
01:17:15,429 --> 01:17:19,193
- What is it?
- Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that.

594
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:22,463
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake.
But it does the trick.

595
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,602
How much of this crap
do you have anyway?

596
01:17:31,379 --> 01:17:34,142
You have a little trouble with that ear,
don't you, Joe?

597
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:39,482
Ah, real problem's the inner ear.
It's anvils and stirrups and shit.

598
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,385
I'm a little out of balance.

599
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:50,171
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee.

600
01:17:50,305 --> 01:17:52,430
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

601
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:55,770
I bet I surprised the shit out of you.

602
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,449
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe.

603
01:18:04,087 --> 01:18:06,520
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife.

604
01:18:06,824 --> 01:18:09,018
I don't give a shit about medals.

605
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,430
The first one they gave me...

606
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,199
I threw it into the ocean.

607
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,768
What'd you get that one for?

608
01:18:29,847 --> 01:18:31,608
For not dyin'.

609
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:38,310
The 15 men who fought with me
got decorated too. For dying.

610
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:40,579
So...

611
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,592
Lieutenant was killed
the night before and...

612
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:54,805
none of the sergeants even made it
out of the landing craft, so...

613
01:18:57,243 --> 01:19:00,439
that left me in charge.
It was my first command.

614
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:09,075
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp
marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.

615
01:19:12,626 --> 01:19:14,615
And I did.

616
01:19:17,964 --> 01:19:20,989
All of the men under my command...

617
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,329
men who trusted me...

618
01:19:33,448 --> 01:19:36,905
who begged me to pull back...

619
01:19:41,556 --> 01:19:43,545
not one of them made it.

620
01:19:47,463 --> 01:19:50,453
Just one stupid asshole.

621
01:19:56,238 --> 01:19:59,695
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.

622
01:20:02,712 --> 01:20:04,871
What were their names?

623
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:08,708
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.

624
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:12,116
You know, who they were
and what they were like.

625
01:20:14,657 --> 01:20:19,855
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit.
What the hell for?

626
01:20:20,497 --> 01:20:22,622
To honor them.

627
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,389
Their memory.

628
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:31,136
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe.
You were just followin' orders.

629
01:20:31,975 --> 01:20:33,770
Yeah.

630
01:20:33,844 --> 01:20:36,778
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

631
01:20:40,352 --> 01:20:42,785
That's why they gave me this detail.

632
01:20:47,391 --> 01:20:49,152
Yeah.

633
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:51,925
I'm a good fuckin' marine.

634
01:21:21,695 --> 01:21:23,524
- Joe!
- What?

635
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:31,232
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

636
01:21:31,305 --> 01:21:32,771
Really.

637
01:21:49,457 --> 01:21:51,446
It's all right.

638
01:21:52,494 --> 01:21:54,984
Come on, Joe. I got you.

639
01:23:15,347 --> 01:23:17,336
What the fuck?

640
01:23:22,388 --> 01:23:25,878
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee.
You cut that horseshit out.

641
01:24:00,126 --> 01:24:02,889
What's your expected arrival
to the village? Over.

642
01:24:03,631 --> 01:24:07,121
Around 1500. Aerial Reconnaissance
reports no movement, looks secure.

643
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:09,430
Request hot chow and mail if possible.
Over.

644
01:24:11,071 --> 01:24:15,335
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in
this Swedish concoction called yoghurt.

645
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:18,105
God willin', America
will develop the taste.

646
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:23,320
What about you, Charlie? What's life
got in store for you after this mess?

647
01:24:23,455 --> 01:24:23,886
Sheep.

648
01:24:23,955 --> 01:24:27,013
Sheep? As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?

649
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,294
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock
in the Four Corners area.

650
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:35,354
No shit?

651
01:24:36,068 --> 01:24:39,434
- You a rich man, Whitehorse?
- We do OK.

652
01:24:39,505 --> 01:24:43,908
Taxis. A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em.
That's how I'm making my millions.

653
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:47,878
And then I'm goin' back
to the motherland.

654
01:24:47,946 --> 01:24:51,039
I'm gonna build myself a villa
on the cliffs of Santorini.

655
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:54,414
Ah, Santorini, my friends - that's living.

656
01:24:55,455 --> 01:24:58,684
Sounds nice. What about you, Zee?

657
01:24:59,392 --> 01:25:01,291
Thinkin' about teaching.

658
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,556
Ah, teaching. Bring a little something
back to the reservation?

659
01:25:05,632 --> 01:25:10,659
Actually, more interested in bringing
some of the reservation back to the world.

660
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,467
Hoping to teach college.
American history.

661
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,473
Oh, that's just what we need.

662
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:20,410
Yahzee teachin' college boys about
Custer's scalpin' at Little Bighorn.

663
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:24,983
And what about Kit Carson, and what
they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?

664
01:25:25,052 --> 01:25:27,542
You ever read about that, Chick?

665
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:30,178
Didn't think so.

666
01:25:31,592 --> 01:25:33,581
How about you, Joe?

667
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,259
- What?
- What are you doin' after this mess?

668
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:39,321
It's gotta end sometime.

669
01:25:43,005 --> 01:25:46,234
Dear Joe, we got great news today.

670
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:51,003
President Roosevelt announced
the end of blackouts on Hawaii.

671
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,707
We thought the day would never come.

672
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:58,913
There's still a ten o'clock curfew,
but it doesn't matter to me.

673
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:04,287
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired
to do anything but write letters.

674
01:26:06,997 --> 01:26:12,161
There is a real sense that the war
is going well, and could be over soon.

675
01:26:14,605 --> 01:26:19,166
I think about you more and more.
If you're alive or dead out there.

676
01:26:20,444 --> 01:26:24,640
I check the mail every day, knowing
there's going to be an answer.

677
01:26:24,716 --> 01:26:27,115
Are you reading these, Joe?

678
01:26:27,618 --> 01:26:29,607
Are you listening?

679
01:26:34,926 --> 01:26:37,689
- We're secure on the left side.
- Area's secured.

680
01:26:37,762 --> 01:26:39,956
Set up defense positions.

681
01:26:40,032 --> 01:26:42,261
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.

682
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:44,128
Harri.

683
01:27:39,594 --> 01:27:40,991
What's wrong?

684
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:43,519
I'm hurting.

685
01:27:49,705 --> 01:27:52,104
Here's some pain reliever.

686
01:28:05,554 --> 01:28:07,851
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

687
01:28:13,462 --> 01:28:14,758
Thank you, Uncle.

688
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:37,349
That's startin' to sound like something.

689
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,794
I didn't know you were an artist.

690
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:30,033
Oh, it's stupid.

691
01:29:30,105 --> 01:29:35,613
It's just something I would do as a kid
on my grandmother's kitchen table.

692
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,046
Well, it's nice.

693
01:29:38,116 --> 01:29:40,105
You Catholic?

694
01:29:42,621 --> 01:29:44,610
I used to be.

695
01:29:46,091 --> 01:29:49,253
I was thinkin' about
when they confirmed me.

696
01:29:49,328 --> 01:29:52,763
I was eight, and they anointed me
with the holy water.

697
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:54,990
And I remember...

698
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:59,763
they told me I was a soldier of Christ.

699
01:30:03,544 --> 01:30:07,376
I guess somewhere along the way
I must have switched units.

700
01:30:09,616 --> 01:30:11,605
It's oil.

701
01:30:13,554 --> 01:30:16,886
They don't use holy water to confirm.
They use oil.

702
01:30:17,757 --> 01:30:19,882
I was raised Catholic too.

703
01:30:20,495 --> 01:30:22,894
Mission school on the reservation.

704
01:30:23,864 --> 01:30:28,128
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us
talking Navajo at Mass.

705
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:32,105
Of course, one Sunday I forgot.

706
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:37,636
They punished me by tying me
to the radiator in the basement.

707
01:30:37,713 --> 01:30:39,702
For two days.

708
01:30:41,282 --> 01:30:43,010
I think I was eight too.

709
01:30:43,919 --> 01:30:46,648
Well, they're sure
lettin' you talk Navajo now.

710
01:30:46,722 --> 01:30:48,415
Yeah.

711
01:30:55,264 --> 01:31:00,166
You know, when this is over, maybe
you should come out to Navajo country.

712
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:04,869
Monument Valley is a beautiful place.
It's peaceful.

713
01:31:05,408 --> 01:31:08,774
You know, we could do some things
that you don't do in the Corps.

714
01:31:08,845 --> 01:31:14,406
Like ride horses, eat fry bread,
do some hunting...

715
01:31:17,187 --> 01:31:19,176
Horses.

716
01:31:24,262 --> 01:31:27,787
I don't know.
It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.

717
01:31:27,865 --> 01:31:31,595
But it might be worth it.
You know, you could meet my son.

718
01:31:32,203 --> 01:31:34,762
And he could meet Joe Enders,

719
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:40,099
the guy who watched
over Daddy's scrawny ass.

720
01:31:44,682 --> 01:31:47,149
You must be a very good father, Ben.

721
01:31:48,953 --> 01:31:53,012
Ben. You know,
you've never called me that before.

722
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,520
Enders. What kind of name
is that anyway?

723
01:31:59,132 --> 01:32:04,660
It's ltalian. Used to be Endrolfini before
some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it.

724
01:32:06,805 --> 01:32:10,102
Captain needs to code a message
back to command post.

725
01:32:10,176 --> 01:32:11,733
You the Indian?

726
01:32:11,811 --> 01:32:14,108
Yeah, I'm the Indian.

727
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:17,579
It's just a few minutes' drive.
We'll get you back in no time.

728
01:32:43,244 --> 01:32:46,939
- I need to speak with you, Gunny.
- Yeah. Give me a second.

729
01:32:47,415 --> 01:32:51,315
Got this with the mail today.
You ever had pickled herring?

730
01:32:53,622 --> 01:32:55,611
I need out.

731
01:32:56,157 --> 01:32:58,716
What the hell are you talkin' about?

732
01:32:58,794 --> 01:33:00,783
This detail.

733
01:33:01,196 --> 01:33:03,253
My duty.

734
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:05,319
I can't do it.

735
01:33:05,867 --> 01:33:08,130
Well, I need you, Enders.

736
01:33:08,204 --> 01:33:10,933
Yeah. You've been saving
a lot of marines.

737
01:33:14,777 --> 01:33:19,577
I'm requesting mast with
battalion commander. I want out.

738
01:33:21,017 --> 01:33:25,952
Oh, yeah? You and me and every
other mother's son. We all want out.

739
01:33:26,723 --> 01:33:30,487
Well, as long as there's
a Tojo and a Hitler out there

740
01:33:30,561 --> 01:33:33,654
we have to keep on fighting.
Is that understood?

741
01:33:35,164 --> 01:33:38,360
- You're not hearing me.
- I'm hearing you just fine.

742
01:33:39,169 --> 01:33:41,762
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide,

743
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:45,674
and it ain't bein' waged
on your wants and wishes.

744
01:33:45,743 --> 01:33:48,404
Now you get some sack time.
That's an order.

745
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,743
Goddamn it! I can't do it!

746
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:53,678
I can't perform my duty!

747
01:34:09,134 --> 01:34:11,226
Hey there, sweetheart.

748
01:34:11,302 --> 01:34:13,394
Hi. It's OK.

749
01:34:14,206 --> 01:34:17,231
You don't have to cry.
You're gonna be all right.

750
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:21,936
Got a present for you.

751
01:34:24,383 --> 01:34:26,440
This is chocolate.

752
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:30,949
You see, you eat it... and it's good.

753
01:34:35,762 --> 01:34:37,751
It's good.

754
01:34:38,198 --> 01:34:40,392
You want some?

755
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,559
You'll have to chew it next time. Here.

756
01:34:57,184 --> 01:34:59,343
Harrigan, go!

757
01:35:09,931 --> 01:35:11,760
Incoming!

758
01:35:20,509 --> 01:35:22,202
Run!

759
01:35:22,277 --> 01:35:23,766
Go! Run!

760
01:35:23,846 --> 01:35:26,005
Harrigan! Make her run!

761
01:35:27,616 --> 01:35:29,605
Come on! To me!

762
01:35:47,337 --> 01:35:49,370
Harrigan!

763
01:36:56,176 --> 01:36:58,405
Come on, keep moving!

764
01:37:22,237 --> 01:37:24,226
Fall back!

765
01:38:27,138 --> 01:38:29,297
Help! Help!

766
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:47,647
I can't let 'em take us.

767
01:38:50,663 --> 01:38:52,926
What are you talking about?

768
01:39:44,352 --> 01:39:45,612
Don't kill him.

769
01:39:45,786 --> 01:39:46,979
He's important.

770
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,289
We need to interrogate him.

771
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,809
Enders!

772
01:41:23,790 --> 01:41:26,053
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.

773
01:41:29,462 --> 01:41:31,394
Have you seen them?

774
01:41:32,733 --> 01:41:34,562
He's over there.

775
01:41:38,105 --> 01:41:39,968
Oh, shit...

776
01:41:59,193 --> 01:42:03,025
This was supposed to be a secured area!
What happened?

777
01:42:06,467 --> 01:42:08,866
I killed him.

778
01:42:09,772 --> 01:42:11,897
You... you what?

779
01:42:12,574 --> 01:42:17,567
I took my grenade and...
and I threw it and I blew him up.

780
01:42:26,074 --> 01:42:28,405
What the hell is wrong with you?

781
01:42:30,613 --> 01:42:32,170
Yahzee!

782
01:42:32,482 --> 01:42:35,109
Yahzee! Yahzee, no!

783
01:42:35,618 --> 01:42:37,107
Get up!

784
01:42:42,091 --> 01:42:44,888
Come on. You can do it.

785
01:42:44,962 --> 01:42:47,725
- Yahzee.
- Let him go.

786
01:42:48,165 --> 01:42:49,994
Yahzee, no.

787
01:42:51,202 --> 01:42:54,034
Go on. Why can't... Come on. Do it.

788
01:42:54,104 --> 01:42:56,093
- Do it!
- No.

789
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:33,672
We heard about Whitehorse, Yahzee. We
shall honor his name and his memory.

790
01:43:33,746 --> 01:43:35,769
Farewell, Charlie, farewell.

791
01:43:36,682 --> 01:43:40,048
Yes, Charlie, farewell.

792
01:43:53,367 --> 01:43:57,166
You know, Whitehorse...
he saved my bacon.

793
01:44:01,075 --> 01:44:04,839
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer
would make of that.

794
01:44:07,548 --> 01:44:12,848
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on
the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians,

795
01:44:12,921 --> 01:44:16,083
like he was talkin'
about gophers or somethin'.

796
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:21,552
About gettin' paid three dollars
per Comanche ear.

797
01:44:23,564 --> 01:44:26,157
I know. Gets you thinkin'.

798
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:33,430
Another 50 years, who knows, we could
be sittin' down with the Nipponese.

799
01:44:33,508 --> 01:44:36,805
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit...

800
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:41,710
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.

801
01:44:44,353 --> 01:44:46,342
You think too much.

802
01:44:51,494 --> 01:44:54,121
First time I ever been accused of that.

803
01:45:56,729 --> 01:46:00,528
Thought I told you not to go
traipsing around on your own.

804
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:12,743
You know, Charlie blessed my son
in the Navajo way the day he was born.

805
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:23,086
He wondered about cowboys
watching Indians' backs.

806
01:46:23,758 --> 01:46:26,191
Something about it didn't seem right.

807
01:46:26,894 --> 01:46:29,828
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.

808
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:36,363
He didn't even want to come
to this damn war. I talked him into it.

809
01:46:40,508 --> 01:46:42,303
Maybe you made a mistake.

810
01:46:53,756 --> 01:46:56,019
Maybe we all did.

811
01:46:57,193 --> 01:46:59,125
I was following orders, Ben.

812
01:47:00,396 --> 01:47:03,125
My orders were to protect the code.

813
01:47:03,966 --> 01:47:09,597
If one of you got caught, talked,
the code would be useless.

814
01:47:17,114 --> 01:47:19,206
I was following orders, Ben.

815
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,847
Course you were, Joe.
You're a damn good fuckin' marine.

816
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,432
The Viking wants to see you.

817
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:47,468
He says right away.

818
01:47:54,687 --> 01:47:57,745
I want you to brief everybody,
make clear what's happenin'.

819
01:47:57,823 --> 01:48:00,663
All right. Got no problem
with point, Gunny.

820
01:48:00,799 --> 01:48:02,822
- That's good.
- You wanted to see me?

821
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,160
Yeah.

822
01:48:04,236 --> 01:48:08,432
The 8th is moving out already
and we need to be ahead of 'em.

823
01:48:08,508 --> 01:48:12,375
The destination is that big piece of rock
you see over there.

824
01:48:12,445 --> 01:48:15,844
The last defensible ridge on this island.

825
01:48:15,915 --> 01:48:20,613
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount,
Saipan is pretty much ours.

826
01:48:24,357 --> 01:48:28,485
Yesterday, bombers
beat the shit out of that rock.

827
01:48:28,795 --> 01:48:33,093
The brass is nervous. They expected
more resistance over there.

828
01:48:34,034 --> 01:48:36,627
Now they want us to go over
and check it out.

829
01:48:37,703 --> 01:48:40,296
So where the hell they got us now?

830
01:48:40,374 --> 01:48:42,306
Goin' up the mountain.

831
01:48:42,744 --> 01:48:45,075
Have ourselves a little peek.

832
01:48:47,215 --> 01:48:50,945
That codetalker is out front for a reason.

833
01:48:51,419 --> 01:48:53,909
That's exactly where I need him to be.

834
01:48:55,055 --> 01:48:57,818
If there's still a problem
between the two of you,

835
01:48:57,893 --> 01:49:01,554
I would like to straighten that out,
right here, right now.

836
01:49:03,565 --> 01:49:06,226
- No problem here, Gunny.
- That's good.

837
01:49:06,969 --> 01:49:09,128
But there's still one here.

838
01:49:10,638 --> 01:49:13,367
You just do what you're
supposed to do, Sergeant.

839
01:49:13,442 --> 01:49:15,534
Nothing more, nothing less.

840
01:49:21,785 --> 01:49:23,774
Enders.

841
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,149
You got another letter.

842
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:34,357
Freeze!

843
01:50:45,371 --> 01:50:49,271
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle
of a goddamn minefield!

844
01:50:49,342 --> 01:50:51,935
Chick's gonna get us out. Right, Chick?

845
01:50:52,712 --> 01:50:54,701
Sure I am.

846
01:50:56,383 --> 01:50:58,542
One line after Chick.

847
01:51:03,357 --> 01:51:05,346
Pappas.

848
01:51:07,428 --> 01:51:09,291
Pappas.

849
01:51:10,432 --> 01:51:12,421
Move, Greek.

850
01:51:12,967 --> 01:51:15,696
I'm gonna get my fuckin' balls
blown off out here!

851
01:51:23,078 --> 01:51:25,067
Yahzee! Stop!

852
01:51:47,136 --> 01:51:49,125
Move out!

853
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:30,302
Yahzee!

854
01:52:30,983 --> 01:52:32,279
Hey!

855
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,625
Nice shootin', Pap.

856
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:13,585
The 8th's movin' in.
We'd better check out the other side.

857
01:53:13,661 --> 01:53:15,753
Got it. You all right?

858
01:53:16,564 --> 01:53:20,396
Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right.
We'll cover you with a 30.

859
01:53:20,469 --> 01:53:22,197
- On it.
- All right?

860
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:24,429
OK, let's go!

861
01:53:24,706 --> 01:53:25,693
Move!

862
01:53:46,695 --> 01:53:48,924
Hjelmstad!

863
01:53:48,998 --> 01:53:51,329
- Help him up!
- Gunny!

864
01:53:54,904 --> 01:53:56,893
Come on. Come on.

865
01:54:08,851 --> 01:54:11,648
- Christ.
- Joe! Joe!

866
01:54:13,956 --> 01:54:15,717
Tear him open.

867
01:54:16,694 --> 01:54:18,717
You want morphine?

868
01:54:18,796 --> 01:54:20,524
- You want morphine?
- Yeah.

869
01:54:24,768 --> 01:54:26,860
You'll be all right, sir.

870
01:54:30,441 --> 01:54:32,566
Goddamn it, Yahzee, get over here!

871
01:54:33,443 --> 01:54:34,840
Fuck!

872
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:38,841
Chick... Stay with him.

873
01:54:41,319 --> 01:54:42,512
I got ya.

874
01:56:19,155 --> 01:56:21,349
I told you to stay with Gunny.

875
01:56:21,891 --> 01:56:23,790
Gunny's gone.

876
01:56:43,781 --> 01:56:46,839
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we, Joe?

877
01:56:48,353 --> 01:56:50,786
I'm runnin' out of ammo here, Joe.

878
01:56:54,591 --> 01:56:57,115
I don't wanna die in this shithole.

879
01:57:00,598 --> 01:57:02,757
You're not gonna die.

880
01:57:05,304 --> 01:57:07,236
Nobody else is gonna die.

881
01:57:17,049 --> 01:57:21,619
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it out of here.

882
01:58:28,624 --> 01:58:32,922
8th's caught out in the open.
We gotta call in the flyboys.

883
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:39,893
I'm gonna get that radio. Cover me.

884
01:59:09,401 --> 01:59:11,526
He got the radio, Yahzee!

885
01:59:42,802 --> 01:59:44,734
Cover me! I'm going!

886
01:59:48,207 --> 01:59:50,436
Stay back!

887
02:00:03,658 --> 02:00:05,248
Fuckers!

888
02:00:56,212 --> 02:00:58,679
It won't bring your friends back.

889
02:01:01,718 --> 02:01:03,947
What do you know about friends?

890
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:46,893
Get us some air support!

891
02:02:00,846 --> 02:02:03,973
Bowie White, this is Carson Red, Arizona.

892
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:06,381
I say again, Carson Red, Arizona.

893
02:02:13,125 --> 02:02:14,954
Coordinates!

894
02:02:15,028 --> 02:02:18,962
Two-twenty, Mike, three-six.

895
02:02:30,011 --> 02:02:32,000
All right, let's go.

896
02:02:33,515 --> 02:02:35,846
We're gonna make it outta here.

897
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:13,178
Damn it, Joe.

898
02:03:16,162 --> 02:03:18,151
Just get it over with.

899
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:21,187
Shut up, Ben.

900
02:03:40,721 --> 02:03:42,710
Do it, Joe.

901
02:03:44,092 --> 02:03:46,081
Do it!

902
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:51,093
No one else is gonna die, Ben.

903
02:03:55,036 --> 02:03:56,831
No one else is dying.

904
02:05:24,329 --> 02:05:26,318
Joe, we did it.

905
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,729
God...

906
02:05:30,636 --> 02:05:32,329
God!

907
02:05:32,971 --> 02:05:35,871
Oh, God... Oh, Joe...

908
02:05:51,058 --> 02:05:53,685
We saved a lot of marines today.

909
02:05:57,631 --> 02:05:59,723
Yeah, we did, Ben.

910
02:06:06,006 --> 02:06:07,905
Charlie...

911
02:06:08,243 --> 02:06:10,642
You know I didn't want to.

912
02:06:13,682 --> 02:06:15,477
Right?

913
02:06:26,695 --> 02:06:28,958
Hail... Hail Mary...

914
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:30,690
full of grace...

915
02:06:30,766 --> 02:06:32,130
our...

916
02:06:32,802 --> 02:06:35,099
our Lord is with thee...

917
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:47,008
Holy Mary, mother of God...

918
02:06:48,552 --> 02:06:50,541
pray for us...

919
02:06:59,129 --> 02:07:01,494
I got the last of 'em, Joe.

920
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:31,853
His name was Joe Enders...

921
02:08:32,494 --> 02:08:34,791
from South Philadelphia.

922
02:08:35,563 --> 02:08:37,688
He was a fierce warrior.

923
02:08:39,468 --> 02:08:41,457
A good marine.

924
02:08:51,314 --> 02:08:54,680
If you ever tell a story about him,
George...

925
02:08:56,253 --> 02:08:58,482
say he was my friend.

926
02:09:30,421 --> 02:09:37,121
The Navajo Code was vital
in the victory at Saipan
and every major battle in the Pacific.

927
02:09:38,464 --> 02:09:43,992
The Code was never broken.
