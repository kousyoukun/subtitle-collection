1
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,620
Charlie!

2
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,430
I wasn't so sure you'd be on the bus

3
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:26,258
Didn't want your white brothers thinking 

4
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
you were the best we had

5
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,883
SOLOMON ISLANDS

6
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,760
Watch out!

7
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,938
My hand!

8
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,425
Goddamn!

9
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:06,062
We're running out of ammo. We gotta get out of here

10
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,338
Move!

11
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,752
Come on!

12
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,857
Come on, you can do it! Come on!

13
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,350
We got nothin', Enders! We're out of ammo!

14
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,887
Joe¡­ Nobody else needs to die. We can go! We can get outta here!

15
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,628
We got orders!

16
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,290
They told us to hold the position! And that's what we're gonna do!

17
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,369
Get up, marine! Hold the goddamn position!

18
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,018
Come on!

19
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:35,919
Get down!

20
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,361
Tommy

21
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,426
Goddamn you!

22
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,068
Oh, no! No!

23
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,415
- Bill! - I'm out

24
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,987
Come on! Come on!

25
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,343
Goddamn you, Joe Enders

26
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,877
No¡­ No!

27
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:40,611
No!

28
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,324
Raise your right hand

29
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:58,029
- I¡­ State your full name¡­ - I, Ben Yahzee¡­

30
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,500
CAMP PENDLETON, CALIFORNIA

31
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,340
..do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the US¡­

32
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:12,545
..against all enemies, foreign and domestic¡­ ..against all enemies, foreign and domestic¡­

33
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,156
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me the code word for ¡°tank¡±?

34
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,999
Come on. You boys wanna be codetalkers

35
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,898
Show me some brains. Think!

36
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,464
What do we call a tank?

37
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,234
Chay-da-gahi

38
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,747
Tortoise. Good

39
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,145
Artillery. Code word?

40
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,118
In code. Private Whitehorse

41
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,889
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?

42
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,424
Very good

43
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,467
Japanese Zero. Code word?

44
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,929
KANEOHE BAY US NAVAL HOSPITAL

45
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,604
We can go! We can get outta here!

46
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,800
They told us to hold the position!

47
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,625
Nice day, huh?

48
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:02,022
Joe?

49
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,430
Joe

50
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,413
Didn't hear a word, did you?

51
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:26,144
That's what happens to a man when he's talking to a beautiful woman

52
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,449
It happens when you're not watching my lips, Joe

53
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,762
Watch this

54
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,708
You're a mess, Joe. You're not fooling anybody

55
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,219
No, Rita. He's a mess

56
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,248
I'm getting better every day

57
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,557
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders. Your equilibrium's all screwy

58
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,689
You can't go back to war if you can't stand up

59
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,736
Let's go, marines. This war ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go

60
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,199
Joe¡­

61
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,359
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?

62
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,924
Somebody's gotta keep the WAVES company

63
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,632
Are you gonna help me or not?

64
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,451
Marked improvement

65
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,489
And his left ear is the worse of the two?

66
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,651
It's¡­ amazing

67
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,393
TBY hasn't got the range of the TBX

68
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,069
So you may need a relay to get your transmission to command post

69
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:35,470
But what it really comes down to is speed and accuracy under pressure

70
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,602
Transcribe now

71
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,509
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over

72
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,083
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!

73
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,354
We're losing men

74
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,689
I need this message decrypted

75
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:07,740
¡°Request fire support. We have target at one-one-niner, Baker one-five.¡±

76
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,843
¡°Pillbox with heavy machine gun. Fire at will.¡±

77
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,274
Beginner's luck

78
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,347
You're up, mac

79
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,089
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir. - At ease

80
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,424
You've done well as a marine, Corporal

81
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,668
Better than you did as a civilian

82
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:14,035
Stole a motorbike, crashed it. Got kicked out of high school

83
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:19,576
Assault and battery¡­ on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

84
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,239
A priest?

85
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:28,082
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan High School, sir, and head disciplinarian

86
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,450
Public-school boy myself

87
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:35,227
Some minor problems in boot

88
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,921
A commendation for valor in Shanghai

89
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,527
And you made a hell of a stand on the Solomons

90
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,694
Tough bit of business there, huh?

91
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,066
Pretty tough, sir

92
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,440
But you're prepared to jump right back into it?

93
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,372
Yes, sir. Very much so

94
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,805
Very much so

95
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,507
Well¡­

96
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:05,086
The Japs have pretty much busted every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal

97
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,217
You men on the Solomons were lost to a broken code

98
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,927
Tell me something. You ever run into any Indians on the Solomons?

99
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,058
- Indians, sir? - Navajo, to be exact

100
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,804
The Corps has developed a new code based on their language

101
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,841
It's had quite an impact

102
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,969
So much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it

103
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,280
That's why you're here

104
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,450
You're to pair with one of them, keep his ass safe

105
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,783
Your job is to keep him alive so he can do his job

106
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:41,192
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs

107
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,228
not baby-sitting some Indian

108
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,161
Enders, we didn't pick your name out of a hat

109
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,901
We need good marines

110
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,597
That's why you're standing here

111
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,503
Take a look

112
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,734
It's a Navajo. Or it was

113
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,778
Tortured to death by Japanese intelligence trying to bust our code

114
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,315
Fortunately, he couldn't help them even if he wanted to

115
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:08,011
- Sir? - Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker

116
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,716
Code's based on their language, but it is still a code

117
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,793
Tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one

118
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,996
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal, cannot leave this room

119
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:29,237
Under no circumstances can you allow your codetalker to fall into enemy hands

120
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,211
Your mission is to protect the code¡­

121
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,915
at all costs

122
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,152
You understand me?

123
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,586
Yes, sir, I do

124
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,352
Good

125
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,053
Congratulations. You just made sergeant

126
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,610
Keep those hands vertical

127
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,616
Way to go, marine

128
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,555
Fortino, take over

129
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,653
Hey¡­ That was you, right, sitting in front of the major's office?

130
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,993
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson

131
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,734
They call me Ox. Not cos of my big muscles or anything

132
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,968
I'm from Oxnard, California. Just north of Hollywood a ways

133
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,105
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

134
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,781
Hey, know where we might find 2nd Joint Assault Signal?

135
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,081
No fuckin' idea, mac

136
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,223
Thanks. Thanks a bunch

137
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:32,292
I've never seen so many white men

138
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,766
They've never seen so many Navajo

139
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,300
Looks to me like you got to see a little action there

140
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,041
Me too

141
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,446
Jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass

142
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,678
You believe that shit? I wasn't running or nothin'

143
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:02,691
So, your duty with JASCO have anything to do with these Navajo radiomen?

144
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,257
I'm not at liberty to say

145
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,966
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too

146
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:18,503
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell me are the same orders I can't tell you

147
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,272
Hell of a thing, huh?

148
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,007
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant. It's the marines

149
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,847
They look pretty normal, I guess

150
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,322
Expecting them to wear war paint?

151
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:40,563
Maybe we ought to go introduce ourselves. They look a little lost to me

152
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,327
Henderson

153
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,106
I wouldn't get too friendly

154
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:54,914
How!

155
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,146
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox

156
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,945
Whitehorse

157
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,950
This is Yahzee. Ben

158
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,090
- Next. - Beautiful. Beautiful

159
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,456
Close your eyes. It'll taste better. Who's next?

160
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,560
Mind if I join you?

161
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,102
I'm Ben Yahzee. Guess the Corps paired us up

162
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,738
How you doin'?

163
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,604
You're blocking my view

164
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,784
Oh, sorry

165
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,552
What do they call this crap anyway?

166
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,691
Marines call it chow

167
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:18,256
Well, there's a propaganda effort

168
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,674
Sorry. You can have mine

169
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,307
Shit

170
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,620
What'd you say your name was again, Private?

171
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,950
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee

172
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,359
Hold this

173
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,840
Shit

174
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,950
How's your white man?

175
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,388
Hungry

176
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,528
I'm in for a couple more

177
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,273
You writing to your son?

178
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,342
Tell him I say hello

179
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,879
Pair of cowboys for Big E

180
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,781
- Possible straight for the Greek. - Possible thumb up the Greek's ass

181
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,877
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid. Lookin' good

182
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:53,024
- Oh, come on! - Now there's a bold move

183
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,721
All right

184
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,322
OK¡­ Oh, another mess for the Sunshine State

185
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,127
- What, are you mad at me? - Just want your money

186
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,760
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty

187
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:07,099
- You shuffle that deck? - I certainly did

188
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,073
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits

189
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:12,810
Call

190
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,937
We all got thumbs up our asses

191
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:20,212
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy in Intel that says we ship out in a week

192
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,288
I been hearing ¡°next week¡± for a month

193
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:26,289
I didn't know you knew anybody in Intelligence, Harri

194
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,290
Next year'd be all right with me

195
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:33,888
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep. Look at that. Nines and fours

196
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,766
Full boat, baby

197
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,133
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die

198
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:42,207
Oh, Jesus!

199
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,671
- Fuck it. I'm out. - Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus

200
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:52,046
God knows what a girlwill do without reassurance

201
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,752
Son of a bitch

202
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:59,290
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats opening up. You wanna come join us?

203
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,884
Are you serious?

204
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,557
What, Injun poker? Hey, how do you boys do that again?

205
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,192
Card on the head, only fool can't see it is you

206
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,966
You want to come on over, or what?

207
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,246
Cut me in

208
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:33,052
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low, hoggers OK, ace plays both ways¡­

209
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,921
Hey, don't let him scare you

210
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:40,124
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's like any other. Waste of time and money

211
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,299
Well, ante up¡­ Chief

212
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,038
How'd you know I was a chief?

213
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:50,370
You must've seen me showering with my war bonnet

214
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:07,085
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up. - You know, we don't take wampum here

215
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,160
Beautiful

216
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:36,354
All right, then

217
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,854
Orders finally came through

218
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,051
We ship out tomorrow morning

219
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:52,161
Destination: the island of Saipan

220
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:57,572
which is one of the stepping stones we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo

221
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,309
It's of strategic importance that we capture this island

222
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:04,143
We can get ourselves an advanced naval base

223
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,548
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's

224
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,485
and get our bombers within range of Tokyo

225
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:16,787
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil, and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in

226
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,363
They're gonna fight for every square inch

227
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:23,094
because it's their home, but we're gonna take it away from 'em!

228
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:26,771
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!

229
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,907
We're gonna be in front of the whole damn division

230
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,608
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears

231
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,909
We're gonna be sniffin' out enemy positions

232
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,918
coordinating the naval gunfire -

233
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:47,924
exactly what we've been training to do for the last four months. All right?

234
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:59,100
Now, we got some new radiomen from headquarters

235
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:02,073
There's a Private Whitehorse¡­

236
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,912
and Yahzee¡­

237
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:13,518
and a couple of sergeants, Enders and Henderson

238
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,748
who, if I'm understanding these orders correctly

239
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:20,154
will be covering our Navajos' asses

240
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,009
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

241
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:58,892
..but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin' into our share of the shit nonetheless

242
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:03,493
Any questions?

243
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,514
Sounds like you're dying

244
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,353
These might help get rid of the taste

245
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:32,829
Charlie and I, we both lost it on the boat ride from San Diego

246
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,734
Not many bodies of water in Arizona

247
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,428
Life Savers really helped

248
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,905
You want a Life Saver?

249
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,534
What are you doin' here?

250
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,246
Just trying to help

251
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,988
Not what I meant

252
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,682
You mean what am I doing in this uniform?

253
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,728
It's my war too, Sergeant

254
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:08,425
I'm fighting for my country, for my land, for my people

255
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:12,203
Not your people I'm worried about

256
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,637
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker

257
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:20,735
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes to do what used to take an hour

258
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,941
Now, somebody wearing a lot more stripes than you

259
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,449
thinks that's worth something

260
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:30,317
Remind me to time you when you got bullets flying over your head

261
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,591
What the hell's wrong with you?

262
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:50,371
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

263
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:54,070
Shave his belly with a rusty razor Early in the morning!

264
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:02,414
From the halls of Montezuma

265
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:06,389
To the shores of Tripoli

266
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:11,157
We will fight our country's battles

267
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:14,926
On the land and on the sea

268
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:19,533
First to fight for right and freedom

269
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:23,267
And to keep our honor clean

270
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:27,602
We are proud to claim the title

271
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:31,478
Of United States Marines

272
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:49,199
Hi

273
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,237
How's that ear?

274
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:57,806
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if it starts aching, take a couple of those

275
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,002
And call me in the morning

276
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,250
You're not gonna be here in the morning, are you?

277
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:11,348
Shipping out without even buying me a drink

278
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:16,427
Ought to be ashamed of yourself, hustling a¡­ hustling marines

279
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,365
What's your poison?

280
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,436
Jeez, might as well go all out. I'll get a shot of something

281
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,061
Rum

282
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,775
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi

283
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,834
Make that two

284
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,911
May as well join me, huh?

285
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,707
- Why not? - OK

286
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,919
Thank you

287
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,947
Well¡­ to war

288
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:04,075
THE JAPANESE ISLAND OF SAIPAN JUNE 16, 1944

289
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,882
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

290
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,628
Get those men spread out!

291
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:36,040
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!

292
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,763

293
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:12,933
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on!

294
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,493
- How am I doin'? - You're good

295
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,200
Let's go!

296
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,935
Stay on my ass

297
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,153
I told you to stay on my ass!

298
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,534
- Stay low! - Get out of there!

299
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,691
Go!

300
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,428

Get me outta here!

302
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,109
- Hold still, damn it! - Get him outta there!

303
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,087
You sons of bitches!

304
00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:00,060
Fortino! Cover me!

305
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,132
Whitehorse, get down!

306
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,831
Get down!

307
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,275
Pappas!

308
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,184
Corpsman!

309
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,880
Helmet goes on your head! Corpsman!

310
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,492
Take care of him

311
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,229
Put a hand on this

312
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,344
Tank! Tank! Tank!

313
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,241
You ready? Go! Go!

314
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,492
Harrigan, light it up!

315
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,904
Let's go, boys! Keep up the fight!

316
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,022
Are you hit? Are you hit?

317
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:07,722
You're OK. You're good, you're good

318
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:11,461
- Are you OK, Chick? - Still in the hunt, Gunny

319
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,628
- Harri? - You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy

320
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,030
- Stay low! - Nellie? Pappas?

321
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,102
Yeah, we're good

322
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,064
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate

323
00:42:23,242 --> 00:42:24,436
What?

324
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,304
I can't breathe when I get excited

325
00:42:27,446 --> 00:42:30,438
Goddamn! Must be hell on your gal!

326
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:53,938
Enders, get the navy on the horn and tell 'em to dig out those guns

327
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,038
Target reference¡­ dog one¡­

328
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,702
right 700

329
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,211
Elevation zero-five-zero

330
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:12,954
Relay the damn coordinates!

331
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:18,962
Arizona! Arizona!

332
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,444
USS CALIFORNIA

333
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:53,860
It sounds like they're underwater. Is it English?

334
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:08,143
Target reference, dog one

335
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,046
south 700, elevation zero-five-zero

336
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,901
Right 200!

337
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:40,242
Up 50. Fire for effect

338
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,972
Let's go!

339
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,578
Move!

340
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:58,555
Harrigan!

341
00:45:59,658 --> 00:46:01,592
Torch the box!

342
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:54,551
Kill him!

343
00:47:19,118 --> 00:47:21,086
Goddamn it!

344
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:25,019
Shit

345
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:29,387
Nellie. Take the satchel charge

346
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:32,187
You hear me? Move!

347
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:40,466
You're gonna cover me, right?

348
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:42,631
I'll go with you. We flank left

349
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:45,639
I'll cover you. Smoke and cover

350
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:47,712
I can do this

351
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,350
I can do this

352
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:04,128
Smoke 'em up!

353
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:11,536
Cover up

354
00:49:02,922 --> 00:49:04,389
Shit!

355
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,256
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!

356
00:49:22,508 --> 00:49:24,339
Heads up around 0500

357
00:49:24,477 --> 00:49:27,969
You're going to have replacements and ammo coming up. Over

358
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:31,407
Roger. Make sure they have the new password

359
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,848
Challenge: ¡°Wind.¡± Answer: ¡°Talkers.¡±

360
00:49:33,986 --> 00:49:35,817
That's what one of our Navajo brothers calls us

361
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:37,320
 What do you think? Over

362
00:49:38,424 --> 00:49:40,688
¡°Windtalkers,¡± I like it. 

363
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:44,193
OK, Kemo Sabe, keep your butts down tonight. Over

364
00:49:46,098 --> 00:49:48,623
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?

365
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:52,535
You are a whiny son of a bitch right now, aren't you?

366
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:58,937
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does that make it on the East Coast?

367
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:01,575
How the fucking hell should I know?

368
00:50:02,415 --> 00:50:04,349
Just seven¡­

369
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:07,618
It's 8am, Sunday morning

370
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:11,120
I hope my side of the bed didn't get taken up Saturday night

371
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:15,316
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer, you keep worrying about her

372
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:17,554
Might get my ass sent back to Rhody, though

373
00:50:17,696 --> 00:50:21,996
There's plenty of dollies outside of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty

374
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:25,297
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here. - Ain't that the truth

375
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:30,501
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach. The most beautiful women in the world

376
00:50:30,643 --> 00:50:33,373
This one time, before the war

377
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:40,418
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little thing named Molly comes out the water

378
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:44,386
She walks straight up to me and asks me if I'm hungry¡­

379
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,423
cos she's havin' a weenie roast

380
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,391
Shit! Damn

381
00:50:49,762 --> 00:50:51,923
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy

382
00:50:57,036 --> 00:51:00,335
Now I'm on Saipan with this giant Zippo strapped to my back

383
00:51:00,473 --> 00:51:02,668
and I'm roastin' human beings

384
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:12,617
Why I volunteered¡­ beyond me

385
00:51:14,753 --> 00:51:17,221
Damn, I'm proud to be here

386
00:51:17,356 --> 00:51:19,722
My whole family's been in the Corps

387
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:22,650
My old man, he's a lifer

388
00:51:23,028 --> 00:51:25,622
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea

389
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:28,132
Around the house too

390
00:51:32,738 --> 00:51:34,933
Maybe now he'll back off

391
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:44,315
Pappas, I¡­

392
00:51:45,918 --> 00:51:47,977
I want you to do me a favor

393
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:52,517
If anything should happen to me

394
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:55,388
you make sure that my wife gets this

395
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,498
I mean, she picked them out and all

396
00:52:00,966 --> 00:52:02,934
Don't talk like that, Nell

397
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:06,863
You don't even joke about shit like that

398
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,805
Now you put that ring back on. You're goin' home

399
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:10,163
Don't thank me till you've tried it

400
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:12,898
You missed mailcall

401
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:25,342
What the hell are they doin'?

402
00:53:26,218 --> 00:53:28,948
I don't know. They've been doin' it since sundown

403
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:37,891
Sounds like some kind of prayer

404
00:53:45,337 --> 00:53:47,498
Maybe they know our orders

405
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:04,186
Think you could do it, Joe?

406
00:54:04,323 --> 00:54:06,348
Give it a rest, Henderson

407
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:10,184
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but¡­

408
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,755
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines

409
00:54:19,438 --> 00:54:21,872
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee¡­

410
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:25,399
You will make your family proud

411
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:17,455
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

412
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:19,793
Getting on my uniform

413
00:55:19,965 --> 00:55:23,560
You know the difference between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

414
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:28,305
It's that uniform

415
00:55:28,974 --> 00:55:30,908
That's it

416
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:34,308
See, I know you people

417
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,341
I know what kind of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy

418
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,413
You ought to be careful out here all alone

419
00:55:42,221 --> 00:55:44,155
No baby-sitter

420
00:55:44,723 --> 00:55:46,657
I might just take you for a Jap

421
00:55:47,826 --> 00:55:50,090
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

422
00:55:50,195 --> 00:55:53,323
Or keep demonstrating what an ignorant fool you are?

423
00:55:58,404 --> 00:56:00,702
How's that for an ignorant fool?

424
00:56:18,557 --> 00:56:20,548
Go ahead, try again

425
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:34,297
You gonna do somethin'?

426
00:56:56,028 --> 00:56:57,495
Chick! Come on!

427
00:56:57,596 --> 00:56:59,530
Get off me!

428
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:21,676
- You OK, Ben? - Yeah

429
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,084
Ben? Shit

430
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:31,324
I thought he was a Jap. You know, killed some marine for that uniform

431
00:57:33,098 --> 00:57:34,963
Sure you did, Chick

432
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,164
Damn Injun looks just like a Jap, don't he?

433
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,203
Look, I'm no damn Injun

434
00:57:40,939 --> 00:57:45,808
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan

435
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:51,573
But you do look like a Nip

436
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:56,620
Next time you decide to take a bath, Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass

437
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,493
Fuckin' shitbird

438
00:58:03,662 --> 00:58:06,290
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter all the time, I thought

439
00:58:06,465 --> 00:58:08,296
Out here huntin' salmon and shit

440
00:58:10,636 --> 00:58:15,096
That ceremony you saw last night? It's called a protection ceremony

441
00:58:16,074 --> 00:58:22,035
Navajo believe, untila body's given a proper burial, the spirits stay near it

442
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:26,985
Chindis - that's what we call evilspirits. Demons

443
00:58:29,755 --> 00:58:32,724
I haven't thought much about it since I was a kid

444
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:35,224
Till I saw those dead bodies

445
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,851
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

446
00:58:37,963 --> 00:58:40,329
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you I won't freeze up again

447
00:58:40,832 --> 00:58:43,801
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?

448
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:48,168
That's right. Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead

449
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:58,007
You ever see ghosts?

450
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:06,687
No more stupid questions today, Private. That's an order

451
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,291
Sounds beautiful

452
00:59:41,026 --> 00:59:42,994
You, uh, you self-taught?

453
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:45,922
My dad was always playing

454
00:59:46,932 --> 00:59:50,060
You know what they say: if you can't beat 'em¡­

455
00:59:50,202 --> 00:59:55,401
No shit. My dad, he¡­ he gave me this thing

456
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:59,233
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs

457
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:03,212
Used to bring 'em in for feeding with this little tune I played

458
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:07,410
I know I ain't gonna get you to quit playin' that thing, so¡­

459
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:10,112
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em¡­

460
01:00:10,255 --> 01:00:12,485
I don't think it's gonna work

461
01:00:13,992 --> 01:00:17,155
Well, we ain't got much else to do out here. What the hell?

462
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:19,990
OK

463
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:23,530
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you

464
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,599
2nd Recon Company will move out at 0600 

465
01:01:03,742 --> 01:01:05,266
and scout along road 04

466
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:08,971
You can expect light resistance northwest of the palm grove. Over

467
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:14,145
Roger. What do you mean, light? No resistance is light! Over

468
01:01:15,187 --> 01:01:17,087
Remember, marine, Ours is not to question why, 

469
01:01:17,222 --> 01:01:18,314
ours is but to do or die

470
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:20,049
Semper Fi. Over

471
01:01:31,737 --> 01:01:34,706
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

472
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:40,235
Or, given that you're not much of a writer, should I not expect an answer?

473
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:43,245
The newspapers say our boys are doing great

474
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:47,818
But I don't think the reporters have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital

475
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,980
I found a stray dog the other day on Waikiki

476
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:54,786
I gave him a bath and took him in

477
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:58,384
He reminded me of you - but cuter

478
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:02,892
At least he keeps me warm at night

479
01:02:04,136 --> 01:02:08,732
I try not to think about you. About what might be happening over there

480
01:02:09,574 --> 01:02:11,735
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed

481
01:02:11,877 --> 01:02:15,176
I can't keep myself from wondering where you are

482
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:17,247
How you're doing

483
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:29,727
What the hell you doin'?

484
01:02:30,395 --> 01:02:32,795
Writing a letter to my son

485
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:35,422
Forget your orders? No letters out

486
01:02:36,168 --> 01:02:39,296
Command don't want postmarks going to the reservation

487
01:02:44,075 --> 01:02:45,906
Hey! You hear me?

488
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:54,882
I thought that he might read 'em when I get home

489
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:02,684
What's his name?

490
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:04,693
Your son

491
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:08,224
It's George. George Washington

492
01:03:09,701 --> 01:03:11,862
George Washington Yahzee

493
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:16,166
It's got a bit of a ring to it

494
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:19,609
My wife wasn't so sure

495
01:03:20,145 --> 01:03:22,545
She's a little more traditional

496
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,818
- Nice-looking family. - Let's see, Yahz

497
01:03:27,953 --> 01:03:32,549
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character. He's got a mind of his own

498
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:38,186
Can I try one of those?

499
01:03:39,064 --> 01:03:41,897
- You smoke? - Not really

500
01:04:20,805 --> 01:04:23,205
- Dismount! - Get out of the truck!

501
01:04:24,376 --> 01:04:26,310
Let's go! Let's go!

502
01:04:26,978 --> 01:04:28,878
- Follow me! - Let's go!

503
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:39,254
- I'm hit! - Yahzee!

504
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,917
Yahzee!

505
01:04:44,462 --> 01:04:45,952
I'm hit!

506
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:48,292
Take it off! It burns!

507
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:55,271
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit

508
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,657
- Spread out! - Move!

509
01:05:24,569 --> 01:05:27,197
- Where the hell are they comin' from? - From us

510
01:05:27,305 --> 01:05:30,474
- What? - They're not Jap guns

511
01:05:31,676 --> 01:05:35,077
- We're getting shot at by our own guys? - We're supposed to be on road 04

512
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:37,010
- Get the regiment on the horn. - I can't!

513
01:05:37,148 --> 01:05:41,482
- Tell 'em they're shelling¡­ - I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit

514
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:47,253
- They're firing too short! - The Japs gotta be way ahead of us

515
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:48,916
Do somethin'

516
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,460
Shit¡­ Follow me!

517
01:05:51,629 --> 01:05:54,291
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road! - Goddamn it!

518
01:06:16,421 --> 01:06:17,888
God

519
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:42,272
Son of a bitch!

520
01:07:04,135 --> 01:07:06,126
I got you, mac!

521
01:07:11,142 --> 01:07:12,905
Corpsman!

522
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:16,375
Corpsman!

523
01:07:21,853 --> 01:07:23,844
Corpsman!

524
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:27,390
Nellie!

525
01:07:31,229 --> 01:07:33,129
Corpsman!

526
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:04,789
You were right, Joe

527
01:08:05,597 --> 01:08:07,292
I do look like a Nip

528
01:08:07,432 --> 01:08:09,457
What the hell are you talking about?

529
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:10,966
Putting on that Jap uniform. 

530
01:08:11,102 --> 01:08:13,969
Trying to get one of their radios, call off our guns

531
01:08:14,105 --> 01:08:16,801
- That's stupid. - Shut up. Let him talk

532
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:20,001
- He's not goin' out there. - You're not in charge here, Enders

533
01:08:20,145 --> 01:08:22,636
I got orders, Gunny. He's my responsibility!

534
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:30,050
He's just a kid! You killed your own!

535
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:35,385
What's wrong with you? You killed your own! Sons of bitches!

536
01:08:36,227 --> 01:08:38,457
You killed your own!

537
01:08:54,112 --> 01:08:57,843
- Sure you're up to this? - Find out soon enough, sir

538
01:09:00,785 --> 01:09:03,913
- What the hell are you doin' there? - I'm goin' with him

539
01:09:04,055 --> 01:09:06,250
If that's OK with you

540
01:09:09,727 --> 01:09:11,627
Give me the rifle

541
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:17,194
Horyo-da

542
01:09:17,835 --> 01:09:19,894
It's Jap for prisoner

543
01:09:20,672 --> 01:09:22,663
Horyo-da

544
01:09:30,682 --> 01:09:32,673
Horyo-da

545
01:09:35,687 --> 01:09:37,951
All right, everybody be ready

546
01:10:35,747 --> 01:10:36,839
Horyo-da!

547
01:10:43,388 --> 01:10:44,514
Now!

548
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:58,397
Hit me. Hit me

549
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,253
Please don't hit me!

550
01:11:55,993 --> 01:11:57,290
Yahzee!

551
01:12:06,738 --> 01:12:08,865
Kill him!

552
01:12:14,412 --> 01:12:16,505
Goddamn it, kill him!

553
01:12:23,187 --> 01:12:24,950
Get on the radio!

554
01:12:33,431 --> 01:12:36,457
Bowie White, Bowie White, this is Carson Red!

555
01:12:39,103 --> 01:12:42,163
Cease fire! Cease fire! You're shelling marines!

556
01:12:43,608 --> 01:12:45,542
Sergeant!

557
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:50,104
Cease fire! Cease fire!

558
01:12:53,284 --> 01:12:55,377
Add 325, fire for effect!

559
01:12:56,687 --> 01:13:00,316
Redirect fire. Add 325, fire for effect

560
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:02,926
Let's go!

561
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:07,354
Crank it up! Let's go!

562
01:13:07,532 --> 01:13:09,124
Commence fire!

563
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,063
Fire!

564
01:13:18,609 --> 01:13:20,133
Well, I'll be

565
01:13:47,004 --> 01:13:48,801
Colonel. Can I help you, sir?

566
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:52,671
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders. Joseph F Enders

567
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:55,641
Enders

568
01:14:04,255 --> 01:14:06,052
Yes, sir

569
01:14:06,858 --> 01:14:10,055
Report I read claims you went above and beyond

570
01:14:11,696 --> 01:14:12,822
Sir?

571
01:14:12,964 --> 01:14:15,296
You've been recommended for commendation

572
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:18,663
And I concur. But I don't see any point in you having to wait around

573
01:14:18,803 --> 01:14:23,069
for all those formalities to work themselves out

574
01:14:23,908 --> 01:14:26,274
Not when I got one of these handy

575
01:14:27,044 --> 01:14:29,444
Congratulations, Enders

576
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,639
You saved a lot of marines

577
01:14:40,391 --> 01:14:45,055
I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have done it without Private Ben Yahzee

578
01:14:45,162 --> 01:14:50,433
Oh¡­ Right. The, uh, Indian

579
01:14:51,936 --> 01:14:55,463
Begging the colonel's pardon, he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People

580
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,574
born for the Towering House clan

581
01:14:58,376 --> 01:15:03,871
Of course. Navajo. Towering House clan

582
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:12,582
You keep up the good work, Enders

583
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:53,593
Send that to Nellie's wife

584
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:36,936
You ever not miss mailcall, Enders?

585
01:16:43,914 --> 01:16:46,474
My mom says somebody takes the time to write a letter

586
01:16:46,617 --> 01:16:48,778
you should read the letter

587
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:54,123
Does she let you drink, your mother?

588
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,352
No. But she's not here

589
01:17:11,509 --> 01:17:15,206
- What is it? - Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that

590
01:17:15,346 --> 01:17:18,474
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake. But it does the trick

591
01:17:22,053 --> 01:17:24,613
How much of this crap do you have anyway?

592
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:30,154
You have a little trouble with that ear, don't you, Joe?

593
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:35,460
Ah, real problem's the inner ear. It's anvils and stirrups and shit

594
01:17:38,269 --> 01:17:40,362
I'm a little out of balance

595
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,066
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee

596
01:17:46,277 --> 01:17:48,336
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

597
01:17:49,013 --> 01:17:51,675
I bet I surprised the shit out of you

598
01:17:57,021 --> 01:17:59,353
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe

599
01:18:00,057 --> 01:18:02,423
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife

600
01:18:02,793 --> 01:18:04,920
I don't give a shit about medals

601
01:18:15,206 --> 01:18:17,333
The first one they gave me¡­

602
01:18:19,009 --> 01:18:21,102
I threw it into the ocean

603
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:25,682
What'd you get that one for?

604
01:18:25,816 --> 01:18:27,511
For not dyin'

605
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:34,223
The 15 men who fought with me got decorated too. For dying

606
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:36,483
So¡­

607
01:18:41,398 --> 01:18:44,458
Lieutenant was killed the night before and¡­

608
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:50,706
none of the sergeants even made it out of the landing craft, so¡­

609
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:56,338
that left me in charge. It was my first command

610
01:18:58,582 --> 01:19:04,987
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp marsh on the ass-end of nowhere

611
01:19:08,592 --> 01:19:10,526
And I did

612
01:19:13,931 --> 01:19:16,866
All of the men under my command¡­

613
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:24,240
men who trusted me¡­

614
01:19:29,413 --> 01:19:32,814
who begged me to pull back¡­

615
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:39,455
not one of them made it

616
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:46,329
Just one stupid asshole

617
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:55,570
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star

618
01:19:58,676 --> 01:20:00,769
What were their names?

619
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:04,604
It might be good to tell a story about 'em

620
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:08,012
You know, who they were and what they were like

621
01:20:10,621 --> 01:20:15,752
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit. What the hell for?

622
01:20:16,427 --> 01:20:18,486
To honor them

623
01:20:19,363 --> 01:20:21,263
Their memory

624
01:20:22,366 --> 01:20:27,030
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe. You were just followin' orders

625
01:20:27,938 --> 01:20:29,667
Yeah

626
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:32,674
I'm a good fuckin' marine

627
01:20:36,313 --> 01:20:38,679
That's why they gave me this detail

628
01:20:43,354 --> 01:20:45,049
Yeah

629
01:20:45,556 --> 01:20:47,820
I'm a good fuckin' marine

630
01:21:17,655 --> 01:21:19,418
- Joe! - What?

631
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:27,092
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

632
01:21:27,264 --> 01:21:28,663
Really

633
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:47,350
It's all right

634
01:21:48,452 --> 01:21:50,886
Come on, Joe. I got you

635
01:23:11,301 --> 01:23:13,201
What the fuck?

636
01:23:18,342 --> 01:23:21,778
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee. You cut that horseshit out

637
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,776
What's your expected arrival to the village? Over

638
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,346
Around 1500. Aerial Reconnaissance reports

639
01:24:01,485 --> 01:24:03,009
 no movement, looks secure

640
01:24:03,153 --> 01:24:05,314
Request hot chow and mailif possible. Over

641
01:24:07,024 --> 01:24:11,222
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in this Swedish concoction called yoghurt

642
01:24:11,328 --> 01:24:13,956
God willin', America will develop the taste

643
01:24:14,531 --> 01:24:19,093
What about you, Charlie? What's life got in store for you after this mess?

644
01:24:19,803 --> 01:24:23,469
Sheep? As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?

645
01:24:25,209 --> 01:24:29,077
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock in the Four Corners area

646
01:24:29,213 --> 01:24:31,147
No shit?

647
01:24:31,915 --> 01:24:35,214
- You a rich man, Whitehorse? - We do OK

648
01:24:35,352 --> 01:24:39,686
Taxis. A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em. That's how I'm making my millions

649
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:43,657
And then I'm goin' back to the motherland

650
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,786
I'm gonna build myself a villa on the cliffs of Santorini

651
01:24:46,964 --> 01:24:50,161
Ah, Santorini, my friends - that's living

652
01:24:51,301 --> 01:24:54,464
Sounds nice. What about you, Zee?

653
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,070
Thinkin' about teaching

654
01:24:57,207 --> 01:25:01,337
Ah, teaching. Bring a little something back to the reservation?

655
01:25:01,478 --> 01:25:06,438
Actually, more interested in bringing some of the reservation back to the world

656
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:09,245
Hoping to teach college. American history

657
01:25:09,386 --> 01:25:11,251
Oh, that's just what we need

658
01:25:11,388 --> 01:25:16,189
Yahzee teachin' college boys about Custer's scalpin' at Little Bighorn

659
01:25:16,927 --> 01:25:20,727
And what about Kit Carson, and what they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?

660
01:25:20,898 --> 01:25:23,298
You ever read about that, Chick?

661
01:25:24,034 --> 01:25:25,934
Didn't think so

662
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:29,337
How about you, Joe?

663
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:33,036
- What? - What are you doin' after this mess?

664
01:25:33,177 --> 01:25:35,111
It's gotta end sometime

665
01:25:38,849 --> 01:25:42,012
Dear Joe, we got great news today

666
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,780
President Roosevelt announced the end of blackouts on Hawaii

667
01:25:46,924 --> 01:25:49,484
We thought the day would never come

668
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:54,657
There's still a ten o'clock curfew, but it doesn't matter to me

669
01:25:55,399 --> 01:26:00,063
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired to do anything but write letters

670
01:26:02,839 --> 01:26:07,936
There is a real sense that the war is going well, and could be over soon

671
01:26:10,447 --> 01:26:14,941
I think about you more and more. If you're alive or dead out there

672
01:26:16,286 --> 01:26:20,416
I check the mailevery day, knowing there's going to be an answer

673
01:26:20,557 --> 01:26:22,889
Are you reading these, Joe?

674
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:25,361
Are you listening?

675
01:26:30,767 --> 01:26:33,463
- We're secure on the left side. - Area's secured

676
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:35,731
Set up defense positions

677
01:26:35,872 --> 01:26:38,033
Chick, bed 'em down for the night

678
01:26:38,175 --> 01:26:39,904
Harri

679
01:27:35,432 --> 01:27:36,763
What's wrong?

680
01:27:37,768 --> 01:27:39,258
I'm hurting

681
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:47,874
Here's some pain reliever

682
01:28:01,391 --> 01:28:03,621
Don't worry, you'll be fine

683
01:28:09,299 --> 01:28:10,493
Thank you, Uncle

684
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:33,118
That's startin' to sound like something

685
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:23,698
I didn't know you were an artist

686
01:29:24,141 --> 01:29:25,938
Oh, it's stupid

687
01:29:26,076 --> 01:29:31,378
It's just something I would do as a kid on my grandmother's kitchen table

688
01:29:31,915 --> 01:29:33,815
Well, it's nice

689
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,884
You Catholic?

690
01:29:38,455 --> 01:29:40,389
I used to be

691
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:45,018
I was thinkin' about when they confirmed me

692
01:29:45,162 --> 01:29:48,529
I was eight, and they anointed me with the holy water

693
01:29:48,665 --> 01:29:50,758
And I remember¡­

694
01:29:53,003 --> 01:29:55,528
they told me I was a soldier of Christ

695
01:29:59,376 --> 01:30:03,142
I guess somewhere along the way I must have switched units

696
01:30:05,449 --> 01:30:07,383
It's oil

697
01:30:09,386 --> 01:30:12,651
They don't use holy water to confirm. They use oil

698
01:30:13,623 --> 01:30:15,648
I was raised Catholic too

699
01:30:16,326 --> 01:30:18,658
Mission school on the reservation

700
01:30:19,696 --> 01:30:23,894
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us talking Navajo at Mass

701
01:30:25,469 --> 01:30:27,869
Of course, one Sunday I forgot

702
01:30:29,372 --> 01:30:33,399
They punished me by tying me to the radiator in the basement

703
01:30:33,543 --> 01:30:35,477
For two days

704
01:30:37,113 --> 01:30:38,774
I think I was eight too

705
01:30:39,749 --> 01:30:44,179
Well, they're sure lettin' you talk Navajo now. Yeah

706
01:30:51,094 --> 01:30:55,929
You know, when this is over, maybe you should come out to Navajo country

707
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,631
Monument Valley is a beautiful place. It's peaceful

708
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:04,537
You know, we could do some things that you don't do in the Corps

709
01:31:04,674 --> 01:31:10,169
Like ride horses, eat fry bread, do some hunting¡­

710
01:31:13,016 --> 01:31:14,950
Horses

711
01:31:20,123 --> 01:31:23,559
I don't know. It's a pretty long drive to Arizona

712
01:31:23,693 --> 01:31:27,356
But it might be worth it. You know, you could meet my son

713
01:31:28,031 --> 01:31:30,522
And he could meet Joe Enders

714
01:31:31,468 --> 01:31:35,871
the guy who watched over Daddy's scrawny ass

715
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:42,910
You must be a very good father, Ben

716
01:31:44,781 --> 01:31:48,774
Ben. You know, you've never called me that before

717
01:31:50,787 --> 01:31:54,279
Enders. What kind of name is that anyway?

718
01:31:54,991 --> 01:32:00,429
It's Italian. Used to be Endrolfini before some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it

719
01:32:02,632 --> 01:32:05,863
Captain needs to code a message back to command post

720
01:32:06,002 --> 01:32:07,492
You the Indian?

721
01:32:07,637 --> 01:32:09,867
Yeah, I'm the Indian

722
01:32:10,006 --> 01:32:13,339
It's just a few minutes' drive. We'll get you back in no time

723
01:32:39,069 --> 01:32:42,698
- I need to speak with you, Gunny. - Yeah. Give me a second

724
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:47,073
Got this with the mailtoday. You ever had pickled herring?

725
01:32:49,446 --> 01:32:51,380
I need out

726
01:32:51,982 --> 01:32:54,473
What the hell are you talkin' about?

727
01:32:54,618 --> 01:32:56,552
This detail

728
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,011
My duty

729
01:32:59,155 --> 01:33:01,089
I can't do it

730
01:33:01,725 --> 01:33:03,886
Well, I need you, Enders

731
01:33:04,027 --> 01:33:06,689
Yeah. You've been saving a lot of marines

732
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:15,333
I'm requesting mast with battalion commander. I want out

733
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:21,709
Oh, yeah? You and me and every other mother's son. We all want out

734
01:33:22,545 --> 01:33:26,242
Well, as long as there's a Tojo and a Hitler out there

735
01:33:26,383 --> 01:33:29,409
we have to keep on fighting. Is that understood?

736
01:33:30,987 --> 01:33:34,115
- You're not hearing me. - I'm hearing you just fine

737
01:33:35,025 --> 01:33:37,516
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide

738
01:33:38,061 --> 01:33:41,428
and it ain't bein' waged on your wants and wishes

739
01:33:41,564 --> 01:33:44,158
Now you get some sack time. That's an order

740
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,495
Goddamn it! I can't do it!

741
01:33:47,203 --> 01:33:49,433
I can't perform my duty!

742
01:34:04,938 --> 01:34:06,963
Hey there, sweetheart

743
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,132
Hi. It's OK

744
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:12,945
You don't have to cry. You're gonna be all right

745
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:17,675
Got a present for you

746
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:22,178
This is chocolate

747
01:34:24,024 --> 01:34:26,686
You see, you eat it¡­ and it's good

748
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:33,499
It's good

749
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,128
You want some?

750
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:41,307
You'll have to chew it next time. Here

751
01:34:52,986 --> 01:34:55,079
Harrigan, go!

752
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,496
Incoming!

753
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:17,902
Run!

754
01:35:18,078 --> 01:35:19,477
Go! Run!

755
01:35:19,646 --> 01:35:21,739
Harrigan! Make her run!

756
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,351
Come on! To me!

757
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:45,002
Harrigan!

758
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:54,033
Come on, keep moving!

759
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:19,865
Fall back!

760
01:38:22,829 --> 01:38:24,922
Help! Help!

761
01:38:41,281 --> 01:38:43,249
I can't let 'em take us

762
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,548
What are you talking about?

763
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,234
Don't kill him

764
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:42,601
He's important

765
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:45,911
We need to interrogate him

766
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:18,437
Enders!

767
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:21,668
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse

768
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:27,010
Have you seen them?

769
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,178
He's over there

770
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:35,584
Oh, shit¡­

771
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:58,641
This was supposed to be a secured area! What happened?

772
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:04,481
I killed him

773
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:07,511
You¡­ you what?

774
01:42:08,255 --> 01:42:13,192
I took my grenade and¡­ and I threw it and I blew him up

775
01:42:21,668 --> 01:42:23,932
What the hell is wrong with you?

776
01:42:26,206 --> 01:42:27,673
Yahzee!

777
01:42:28,074 --> 01:42:31,076
Yahzee! Yahzee, no!

778
01:42:31,178 --> 01:42:32,611
Get up!

779
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:40,381
Come on. You can do it

780
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,585
- Yahzee. - Let him go

781
01:42:43,723 --> 01:42:45,486
Yahzee, no

782
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,524
Go on. Why can't¡­ Come on. Do it

783
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,597
- Do it! - No

784
01:43:24,497 --> 01:43:29,161
We heard about Whitehorse, Yahzee. We shall honor his name and his memory

785
01:43:29,336 --> 01:43:31,270
Farewell, Charlie, farewell

786
01:43:32,272 --> 01:43:35,571
Yes, Charlie, farewell

787
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:52,653
You know, Whitehorse¡­ he saved my bacon

788
01:43:56,630 --> 01:44:00,327
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer would make of that

789
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:08,369
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians

790
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:11,602
like he was talkin' about gophers or somethin'

791
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:17,040
About gettin' paid three dollars per Comanche ear

792
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:21,644
I know. Gets you thinkin'

793
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:28,927
Another 50 years, who knows, we could be sittin' down with the Nipponese

794
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:32,293
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit¡­

795
01:44:34,567 --> 01:44:37,195
lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick

796
01:44:39,939 --> 01:44:41,839
You think too much

797
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:49,607
First time I ever been accused of that

798
01:45:52,278 --> 01:45:56,009
Thought I told you not to go traipsing around on your own

799
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:08,225
You know, Charlie blessed my son in the Navajo way the day he was born

800
01:46:15,301 --> 01:46:18,600
He wondered about cowboys watching Indians' backs

801
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:21,705
Something about it didn't seem right

802
01:46:22,475 --> 01:46:25,342
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie

803
01:46:26,746 --> 01:46:31,843
He didn't even want to come to this damn war. I talked him into it

804
01:46:36,055 --> 01:46:37,784
Maybe you made a mistake

805
01:46:49,335 --> 01:46:51,530
Maybe we all did

806
01:46:52,772 --> 01:46:54,637
I was following orders, Ben

807
01:46:55,975 --> 01:46:58,637
My orders were to protect the code

808
01:46:59,512 --> 01:47:05,075
If one of you got caught, talked, the code would be useless

809
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,684
I was following orders, Ben

810
01:47:17,864 --> 01:47:22,324
Course you were, Joe. You're a damn good fuckin' marine

811
01:47:37,884 --> 01:47:39,909
The Viking wants to see you

812
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,945
He says right away

813
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:53,222
I want you to brief everybody, make clear what's happenin'

814
01:47:53,399 --> 01:47:56,061
All right. Got no problem with point, Gunny

815
01:47:56,135 --> 01:47:57,396
- You wanted to see me?

816
01:47:58,371 --> 01:47:59,565
Yeah

817
01:47:59,706 --> 01:48:03,836
The 8th is moving out already and we need to be ahead of 'em

818
01:48:03,943 --> 01:48:07,743
The destination is that big piece of rock you see over there

819
01:48:07,881 --> 01:48:11,214
The last defensible ridge on this island

820
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:15,981
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount, Saipan is pretty much ours

821
01:48:19,792 --> 01:48:23,853
Yesterday, bombers beat the shit out of that rock

822
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:28,496
The brass is nervous. They expected more resistance over there

823
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:32,027
Now they want us to go over and check it out

824
01:48:33,172 --> 01:48:35,697
So where the hell they got us now?

825
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:37,707
Goin' up the mountain

826
01:48:38,177 --> 01:48:40,441
Have ourselves a little peek

827
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:46,312
That codetalker is out front for a reason

828
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:49,287
That's exactly where I need him to be

829
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:53,186
If there's still a problem between the two of you

830
01:48:53,326 --> 01:48:56,921
I would like to straighten that out, right here, right now

831
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:01,592
- No problem here, Gunny. - That's good

832
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:04,528
But there's still one here

833
01:49:06,105 --> 01:49:08,767
You just do what you're supposed to do, Sergeant

834
01:49:08,908 --> 01:49:10,933
Nothing more, nothing less

835
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:19,150
Enders

836
01:49:20,353 --> 01:49:22,514
You got another letter

837
01:50:27,887 --> 01:50:29,718
Freeze!

838
01:50:40,833 --> 01:50:44,667
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle of a goddamn minefield!

839
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:47,329
Chick's gonna get us out. Right, Chick?

840
01:50:48,174 --> 01:50:50,108
Sure I am

841
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:53,904
One line after Chick

842
01:50:58,785 --> 01:51:00,719
Pappas

843
01:51:02,855 --> 01:51:04,652
Pappas

844
01:51:05,858 --> 01:51:07,792
Move, Greek

845
01:51:08,394 --> 01:51:11,056
I'm gonna get my fuckin' balls blown off out here!

846
01:51:18,538 --> 01:51:20,472
Yahzee! Stop!

847
01:51:42,562 --> 01:51:44,496
Move out!

848
01:52:24,237 --> 01:52:25,670
Yahzee!

849
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,982
Nice shootin', Pap

850
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:08,940
The 8th's movin' in. We'd better check out the other side

851
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:11,106
Got it. You all right?

852
01:53:11,984 --> 01:53:15,750
Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right. We'll cover you with a 30

853
01:53:15,888 --> 01:53:17,549
- On it. - All right?

854
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:19,783
OK, let's go!

855
01:53:20,126 --> 01:53:21,058
Move!

856
01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:44,275
Hjelmstad!

857
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:46,681
- Help him up! - Gunny!

858
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:52,257
Come on. Come on

859
01:54:04,303 --> 01:54:07,033
- Christ. - Joe! Joe!

860
01:54:09,408 --> 01:54:11,103
Tear him open

861
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:14,079
You want morphine?

862
01:54:14,213 --> 01:54:15,874
- You want morphine? - Yeah

863
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:22,211
You'll be all right, sir

864
01:54:25,858 --> 01:54:27,917
Goddamn it, Yahzee, get over here!

865
01:54:28,861 --> 01:54:30,192
Fuck!

866
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:34,190
Chick¡­ Stay with him

867
01:54:36,769 --> 01:54:37,895
I got ya

868
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,693
I told you to stay with Gunny

869
01:56:17,336 --> 01:56:19,167
Gunny's gone

870
01:56:39,191 --> 01:56:42,183
We're not gonna make it out of here, are we, Joe?

871
01:56:43,796 --> 01:56:46,162
I'm runnin' out of ammo here, Joe

872
01:56:50,036 --> 01:56:52,470
I don't wanna die in this shithole

873
01:56:56,008 --> 01:56:58,101
You're not gonna die

874
01:57:00,713 --> 01:57:02,578
Nobody else is gonna die

875
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:16,895
We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it out of here

876
01:57:16,962 --> 01:57:17,257
We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it out of here

877
01:58:23,963 --> 01:58:28,195
8th's caught out in the open. We gotta call in the flyboys

878
01:58:32,638 --> 01:58:35,163
I'm gonna get that radio. Cover me

879
01:59:04,737 --> 01:59:06,796
He got the radio, Yahzee!

880
01:59:38,137 --> 01:59:40,002
Cover me! I'm going!

881
01:59:43,509 --> 01:59:45,670
Stay back!

882
01:59:58,958 --> 02:00:00,482
Fuckers!

883
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:53,910
It won't bring your friends back

884
02:00:57,016 --> 02:00:59,177
What do you know about friends?

885
02:01:39,925 --> 02:01:42,120
Get us some air support!

886
02:01:56,141 --> 02:01:59,201
Bowie White, this is Carson Red, Arizona

887
02:01:59,345 --> 02:02:01,609
I say again, Carson Red, Arizona

888
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:10,183
Coordinates!

889
02:02:10,322 --> 02:02:14,190
Two-twenty, Mike, three-six

890
02:02:25,337 --> 02:02:25,564
All right, let's go

891
02:02:28,841 --> 02:02:31,105
We're gonna make it outta here

892
02:03:06,378 --> 02:03:08,278
Damn it, Joe

893
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:13,284
Just get it over with

894
02:03:14,386 --> 02:03:16,320
Shut up, Ben

895
02:03:35,941 --> 02:03:37,841
Do it, Joe

896
02:03:39,278 --> 02:03:41,178
Do it!

897
02:03:44,016 --> 02:03:46,211
No one else is gonna die, Ben

898
02:03:50,222 --> 02:03:51,951
No one else is dying

899
02:05:19,511 --> 02:05:21,411
Joe, we did it

900
02:05:23,081 --> 02:05:24,844
God¡­

901
02:05:25,817 --> 02:05:27,444
God!

902
02:05:28,153 --> 02:05:30,986
Oh, God¡­ Oh, Joe¡­

903
02:05:46,238 --> 02:05:48,798
We saved a lot of marines today

904
02:05:52,811 --> 02:05:54,802
Yeah, we did, Ben

905
02:06:01,186 --> 02:06:03,017
Charlie¡­

906
02:06:03,422 --> 02:06:05,754
You know I didn't want to

907
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:10,589
Right?

908
02:06:21,873 --> 02:06:24,068
Hail¡­ HailMary¡­

909
02:06:24,209 --> 02:06:25,767
full of grace¡­

910
02:06:25,944 --> 02:06:27,241
our¡­

911
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:30,210
our Lord is with thee¡­

912
02:06:39,024 --> 02:06:42,118
Holy Mary, mother of God¡­

913
02:06:43,729 --> 02:06:45,663
pray for us¡­

914
02:06:54,306 --> 02:06:56,604
I got the last of 'em, Joe

915
02:08:24,663 --> 02:08:26,858
His name was Joe Enders¡­

916
02:08:27,566 --> 02:08:29,796
from South Philadelphia

917
02:08:30,635 --> 02:08:32,694
He was a fierce warrior

918
02:08:34,573 --> 02:08:36,473
A good marine

919
02:08:46,384 --> 02:08:49,683
If you ever tell a story about him, George¡­

920
02:08:51,323 --> 02:08:53,484
say he was my friend

921
02:09:24,893 --> 02:09:30,799
The Navajo Code was vital in the victory at Saipan and every major battle in the Pacific

922
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:37,630
It was never broken
