1
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:53,613
So tell me. How was Hawaii?

2
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:57,251
- It was unbelievable.
- Oh, yeah?

3
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:59,952
- Well, what happened?
- I met this guy.

4
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,724
It was the best week of my life.

5
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,766
It was just a little
vacation romance.

6
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,801
But he was so sweet.

7
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:10,303
He took me to all these
cool local places.

8
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:12,771
We went scuba diving...

9
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:15,309
- Snorkeling.
- Mountain climbing.

10
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,047
We went cliff diving.

11
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:22,616
Well, we got a little drunk.

12
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:24,651
- He gave me...
- A back rub.

13
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,118
We slow danced...

14
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:27,688
- in the rain.

15
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:29,951
But it wasn't just about the sex.

16
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:33,419
He pounded me like a mallard duck.

17
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:36,598
It ended kind of weird, though.

18
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:39,030
When I asked for his number,
he said he's...

19
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:40,464
- Married.
- Gay.

20
00:01:40,637 --> 00:01:43,299
- Entering the priesthood.
- He doesn't believe in phones.

21
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:46,874
He just kind of ran away.

22
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:49,534
You know, it was just
a little fling, but...

23
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:51,203
I won't forget my week...

24
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:52,780
- with Henry Roth.

25
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:55,645
- Henry Roth.
- Harry.

26
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,379
Harry Paratesticles.

27
00:01:58,555 --> 00:02:00,614
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,985
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

29
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,390
Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me
you were a secret agent?

30
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:11,227
I prefer intelligence operative,
and I couldn't tell you until I knew you.

31
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,369
Well, can I call you when I land?

32
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:17,097
You can call me, but I' II be in Peru.
I said that a little loud.

33
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:21,233
Come on, that's a 187, code blue.
We got the wolf sleeping at night.

34
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:25,745
He's slipping his arm in the drawer
and out comes the cookie jar. All clear.

35
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,912
Got it?

36
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,152
Well, maybe when you
get back from Peru.

37
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:34,714
- I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
- Linda.

38
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:38,258
I know. I changed your name
for your protection.

39
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,496
We have to go our separate ways now.

40
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,157
Well, goodbye.

41
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:47,166
Got it! Moving out!

42
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:55,010
- What the hell is your problem?
- Just keep going, I' II give you $20.

43
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:59,376
- You got it. How's your balls?
- Killing me. Hit it.

44
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,460
Easy, Honah Lee.

45
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,827
Hey, I' m a person, not a seal

46
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:25,498
Well, I am a vet, not a doctor. So just
hold still, or I won't give you a treat.

47
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:27,540
I know, it's okay.
You see that, kids?

48
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:30,737
You see what happens
when you play with sharks?

49
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:34,406
Now, why you gotta spread those lies?
Sharks are like dogs.

50
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:37,212
They only bite when you
touch their private parts.

51
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:40,546
That's a good title
for my documentary.

52
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:44,785
Sharks: They Only Bite When
You Touch Their Private Parts.

53
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:48,556
Or you could call it,
Sharks: They Tried to Eat My Kidney.

54
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:52,099
All right, enough already.
You too, Willie.

55
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:56,396
All of you.

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,330
He just cast a spell on us.

57
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:02,543
All right. Put this on four times
a day for two weeks.

58
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:05,613
- You can handle that.
- What's wrong with that turtle?

59
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:08,580
Lung problems because
he smoked too much turtle weed...

60
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:10,811
...which is bad for you. Right, Ula?

61
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,421
What? I don't smoke weed.

62
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:18,460
Hey, Honah Lee? How's that hot
wahine nympho from Ohio?

63
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:21,324
Great. I dropped her off
at the airport this morning.

64
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,022
Come on, I need some details.

65
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,362
You get some booby, some assy,
a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.

66
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:28,197
Daddy, what's a nympho?

67
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:32,834
Oh. The nympho
is the state bird of Ohio.

68
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:36,839
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.

69
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:40,312
Here you go. Bite the fish,
chew the fish, love the fish. Enjoy.

70
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:43,281
- You crack me up, kamaaina.
- Oh, yeah?

71
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,852
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

72
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:47,819
...you'll show one of those
tourists such a good time...

73
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:49,788
...she'll wanna stay on the island.

74
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,893
Why do you say
mean things like that...

75
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:54,553
...and why is your foot
on my pillow?

76
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:58,860
I don't want your ass on it, either.
Get up! Get up!

77
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,662
It could happen.

78
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:03,704
Then you won't be able to go
on your boat trip to Alaska.

79
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,643
You'll be stuck here, waking up next to
the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula.

80
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,251
- Just kidding, guys.
- About the old part or the ugly part?

81
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:23,251
Henry, come quickly!
It's Jocko!

82
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,730
Jocko! What's going on
with you, buddy?

83
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:35,769
Don't be scared.
Everything's gonna be fine.

84
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:38,305
Just stay calm. All right.

85
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:42,571
Willie, I don't need you to see this.
Get out of here, now!

86
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:45,270
Okay, check the temperature
of the pool Go! Hurry!

87
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,210
What are you doing?
I meant check the thermometer!

88
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,445
Give me a hand. Let's go!

89
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:54,886
Get me two fish
from the barrel Now.

90
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,389
- Okay.
- Just hang in there.

91
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,493
- Here.
- It 's gonna be all right.

92
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:01,721
That's a little warm.
Go to the bottom of the barrel, please.

93
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:10,966
Okay, there. That's good. Thank you.

94
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:12,870
Come on, buddy, take it. Take it.

95
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:15,033
- He's not responding!
- I know, Alexa!

96
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:18,237
Sorry, I smacked you. You needed
the fish-slap to calm down.

97
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:21,383
- Do you understand? Are you calm?
- Yes. Fish-slap calm me.

98
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:23,951
I'm gonna try to get him
breathing manually...

99
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,317
...so I need your face next
to his mouth to see if it's working.

100
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,923
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

101
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:31,458
- One, two, three!
- Nothing, nothing!

102
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:36,065
All right! Try it again. If it doesn't
work we'll perform a tracheotomy.

103
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:39,429
We don't wanna do that, so let's
pray this works. One more time.

104
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:41,627
One, two...

105
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,240
That's a lot of vomit.

106
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,749
This is why I got into
this business.

107
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,013
To save sea animals.

108
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,123
You should go
wash yourself off, okay?

109
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:05,017
Maybe try some turpentine.
That might take the stink away.

110
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:09,031
Yeah, high-five is right, buddy.

111
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,999
I knew you were gonna burp,
but the vomit thing was awesome!

112
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,366
That's what she gets for eating
my roast beef sandwich.

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,302
Willie, did you see that?

114
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:42,193
Captain's log:
November 5th, 6:45 a.m.

115
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:45,664
I've taken the Sea Serpent for
a trip around the island of Oahu.

116
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:48,736
It is by far the longest voyage
she has yet underaken...

117
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:51,567
...and its completion will signal
that she's ready...

118
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,834
...for our great journey
to Bristol Bay...

119
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,502
...whose unspoiled walus habitat
will yield an abundance of...

120
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:07,312
Damn it!

121
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,317
Are you kidding me?

122
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,443
Aloha, honey.
What can I get for you?

123
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,105
I guess I' II take a cup of coffee.

124
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:36,909
- You guess?
- Yeah, I already ate breakfast.

125
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:40,783
I need to kill some time before the
Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.

126
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:42,219
What did you eat?

127
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:46,055
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
and some Gatorade.

128
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:49,255
They're not breakfast.
I get you Spam and eggs.

129
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:51,798
Nick, I need Spam and eggs.

130
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,062
Hey.

131
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,735
- You like the peanut butter cups?
- Yes.

132
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:00,273
Want me to put peanut butter cups
in your eggs?

133
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,742
No, that's okay.

134
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:05,541
Peanut butter cups.

135
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:26,832
- Hey, Sue, nice haircut.
- Mahalo, Lucy.

136
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,530
Are you staring at me or her?

137
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:02,694
Because you're starting
to freak me out.

138
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:06,840
Settle down and eat your pancakes.

139
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,644
I think she's a local girl
I wanted to go up to her...

140
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:17,081
...but I was kind of off my game.
But, man, was she cute, though.

141
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,778
I thought you liked your bitches
from out of state.

142
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:23,989
Yeah, that's usually my policy.
Make sure I don't get tied down.

143
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
Freeze that image right there.

144
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:30,629
There's the little fella.
Congratulations, Mommy.

145
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:35,199
Sounds to me like someone
is afraid of commitment.

146
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,929
Let me guess.

147
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,597
Your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party...

148
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:42,870
...then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team.

149
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:46,242
Close. Actually, it was my
college girlfriend Tracy.

150
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,442
And it wasn't a wrestling team.
It was her academic advisor.

151
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:53,646
- Oh, she liked the older man.
- Older women. About 50 years older.

152
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,984
I hope you shot the stupid tramp.

153
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,525
What's with the "tramp"
and the "bitches" talk?

154
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:02,289
- Are you drunk or something?
- I apologize for nasty talk.

155
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:05,832
I am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy.

156
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:09,903
Shut up, because here comes
one-time-only opportunity.

157
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:13,940
What I will do now is go into
your office and become naked.

158
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:17,739
Next move is up to you.

159
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:21,181
I may not be as limber
as I once was...

160
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,845
...but I make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment.

161
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:30,859
I don't know if you realize,
I'm not into guys.

162
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,573
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.

163
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:55,376
Hey, Mr. Could -Kill -Me-in-One-Punch.
How you doing?

164
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:58,213
- You're back.
- Couldn't get enough of that Spam.

165
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,480
Fry some up and throw
some eggs on it.

166
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,214
- You got it.
- All right, mahalo.

167
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:05,189
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Nick.

168
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:21,743
You know, why don't you try this?

169
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,174
It's kind of a hinge.

170
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:33,282
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Well, you're too close to the project.

171
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:34,787
Don't be hard on yourself.

172
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:38,022
Right. Sometimes you need
an outsider's perspective.

173
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:39,923
Fresh eye never hurts.

174
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm Lucy.

175
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:44,966
Yes. I' m Henry Roth.

176
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,965
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

177
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:50,196
It's pretty. Keep up the good work.

178
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:55,674
Wait. I see you're sitting there alone.
Do you wanna come and sit down?

179
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,545
- Sure, that'd be great, if that's all right.
- Okay.

180
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,387
- So are you an architect?
- I am not. I' m in fish.

181
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:09,787
Oh, that's where the smell
is coming from.

182
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,621
Yeah, yeah, I was feeding
a walrus this morning...

183
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:16,629
...and I thought I got most of it
off of me, but guess I didn't.

184
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,467
- I love that smell.
- No, you don't.

185
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:22,968
- Fish don't even like that smell.
- No, I do. My dad's a fisherman.

186
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:27,308
He and my brother Doug, they go
out to sea for months at a time.

187
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:31,003
And I miss them so much while they're
gone that when they come back...

188
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,048
...I just hold on to them
for five minutes each.

189
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:43,154
And they smell just like your hands.
It's the best smell in the world.

190
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,656
Well, my fingers are available...

191
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:48,558
...for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them.

192
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,433
- Wanna?
- Okay.

193
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:03,944
Sea lions are known
for their athleticism...

194
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:06,547
...and dolphins are known
for their intelligence.

195
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:11,212
- Walruses are known for their...
- Tusks?

196
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:17,326
Their tusks. Also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic.

197
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,790
Yeah, yeah, it's the second biggest
out of all the mammals.

198
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:26,023
- What's the first?
- I think Tattoo-Face.

199
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:32,100
Ilike your laugh.

200
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:34,266
Ilike you making me laugh.

201
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:37,310
I hate to break this up,
but we're setting up for lunch.

202
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:40,241
Oh, okay. Sorry, Sue.

203
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,484
And the real cool thing about walruses
is they're very mysterious.

204
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,884
- Mysterious?
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:49,820
We don't really know what
they're like in the wild.

206
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:53,223
Don't they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

207
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:56,263
All we really see is what they do
outside of the water...

208
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:58,957
...but who knows what
they do under the ice...

209
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,433
...where they spend
two-thirds of their lives.

210
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:06,303
Well, maybe they're intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies.

211
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,636
That is one theory.

212
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,344
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

213
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:16,212
It's my dad's birthday, and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple.

214
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:20,151
- It 's a tradition.
- That sounds nice. Okay, well...

215
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:21,812
...I had a great time.

216
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:24,084
- Me too.
- Okay.

217
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,460
Would you like to have breakfast
again tomorrow morning, same time?

218
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:31,031
- Because I teach an art class at 10.
- Really?

219
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,792
- Yeah.
- I wish I could make it...

220
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:34,993
...but, yes, I will be there.

221
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,433
- Take care.
- Okay.

222
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,770
- One for the road. It is fishy.
- Got you good.

223
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:43,343
- Aloha.
- Aloha!

224
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:45,446
See you tomorrow.

225
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:48,276
Oh, my God.

226
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:51,312
Oh, my goodness.

227
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,157
Shit.

228
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,627
I had a bee on me.

229
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:09,134
- All right.
- He was a big one.

230
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:16,070
Which means
"look at those two shitheads."

231
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:26,350
That was the stupidest-looking
swing I' ve ever seen.

232
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:28,854
I'm gonna take a Molokai
on that one.

233
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:31,515
No throwing. Come on.

234
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,322
Stop laughing, you hyenas.
Let's see what you get.

235
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,829
Okay, you heard me. Go! Go!

236
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,591
Show papa what you got.

237
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:53,639
- You suck, you're good at everything.
- Father of the Year strikes again.

238
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:58,947
By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blond
tax attorney at Starbucks today.

239
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:03,387
I told her you the kahuna
she wanna have fun on this island.

240
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,322
You want her number?

241
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:07,223
You pimping tourists for me again?

242
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:10,058
Yes! I live vicariously
through you, remember?

243
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:11,494
My life sucks.

244
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,898
Now, come on. Give her the Waikikiki
sneaky between the cheeky.

245
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:20,375
Ula needs it. I imagine I did it and then
I can get through another weekend.

246
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:22,807
I'm staying in. Sorry.
Thank you, though.

247
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:24,707
- What?
- Hey, Dad!

248
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,871
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.

249
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,607
But your stitches are bleeding.

250
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,983
It must've been my huge back-swing.

251
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:36,283
You think you can stitch me up
after I get back from surfing?

252
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,985
- Yeah, looking forward to it.
- I wouldn't surf with a wound like that.

253
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,527
You might attract a shark.

254
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:44,393
What's wrong with that?
Sharks are naturally peaceful

255
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,559
Is that right?
How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?

256
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,226
A shark bit me.

257
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:50,963
Nice.

258
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,165
Go smoke another one, bro.

259
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:55,537
That shark theory's
starting to catch on.

260
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,474
Now, will everybody keep it down...

261
00:17:57,646 --> 00:18:00,638
...while I whack the crap
out of this thing?

262
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:07,914
Sit! Stay! Shit! No!

263
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,887
Where the hell is it?

264
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,322
Looking for something?

265
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:27,865
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

266
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:31,206
The same thing you are.
Looking for my ball.

267
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:35,815
This is weird. I' ve been thinking
about you all morning, all day.

268
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:38,246
Can't wait to have breakfast
with you again.

269
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,389
I know. And I just wanna eat you up.

270
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:44,993
- Really?
- Yeah. Tomorrow and the next day...

271
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,061
...and the next day and the next day.
- All right. Okay.

272
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,522
Oh, my.

273
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,964
Oh, Lucy, that feels so good.

274
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:58,539
No, my nipples are too sensitive.
Stop that.

275
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:05,770
- What happened?
- Your ball hooked into that cart...

276
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:09,315
...bounced back and hit you in
the head. It was freaking hilarious.

277
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,442
- What?
- Who's Lucy?

278
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,384
And what's up with your nipples?

279
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:19,959
I can't be falling for a local
I ain't ever going back to that diner.

280
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:22,893
- This where you got hit?
- Yes!

281
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:32,329
You're so lucky you're a professional
cliff diver in Hawaii.

282
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,999
- Yeah, well, it's a living.
- I' m a tax attorney.

283
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:37,873
- We never get to have any fun.
- Is that right?

284
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:43,383
I'd like to do something
extra fun tonight.

285
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:54,861
Taking it deep, aren't you?

286
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,028
How about another
fishbowl for the lady?

287
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:05,105
- Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
- Okay.

288
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:08,466
I think I' m getting kind of drunk.

289
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:11,340
- Are you getting drunk?
- Getting there.

290
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:14,778
So, what are you thinking?

291
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:20,947
What am I thinking?

292
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:27,225
Actually, I' m not drunk at all,
Noreen, and neither are you...

293
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:30,729
...because there's no alcohol
in these drinks.

294
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,557
Sadly, I' ve used this technique
many times.

295
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,000
It helps lovely tourists,
such as yourself...

296
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:39,299
...loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake...

297
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:42,501
...and have guilt -free,
vigorous sex with me.

298
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:45,270
- Wow.
- I' m sorry.

299
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:49,178
I'm not a cliff diver, either.
I'm afraid of heights.

300
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:52,343
Well, since it's my last night in town...

301
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:57,823
...can I pretend you didn't just say that
and still have sex with you anyway?

302
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:01,355
I can't do it. I' m sorry.

303
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,296
Well, can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can?

304
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:08,860
That guy over there
could help you out.

305
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:14,267
- Isn't that a woman?
- Jeez, I' m not really sure.

306
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:21,077
But you're too drunk to notice,
remember? Take care.

307
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,550
- Hey, you. Aloha.
- Aloha.

308
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:36,926
Not aloha, "hello," aloha, "goodbye."
We're closed today. Go away.

309
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:39,329
- What are you talking about?
- Order up!

310
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:42,295
- Don't move. I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

311
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:45,634
- Hey! Tattoo-Face!
- Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!

312
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:58,383
Hi.

313
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:00,349
Hi.

314
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:03,821
My fingers are extra fishy today,
if you care to take a whiff.

315
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:06,756
What was that?

316
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:10,524
I was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time.

317
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,331
Okay, pervert.
I think that you should leave.

318
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:18,034
What? I was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday.

319
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,408
Yesterday?

320
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,101
I've never even met you.

321
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:26,873
- Nick! I need help!
- Coming, Lucy.

322
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,281
Nick, put that down.
I'll handle it.

323
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:32,750
- You, follow me.
- Wait a... What's going on?

324
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,116
I was kidding around with you!

325
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:39,323
What's happening here?
Is she crazy or something?

326
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:44,364
Lucy is a very special person.
Very different from other people.

327
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,257
Okay.

328
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:50,428
About a year ago, Lucy was
in a terrible car accident.

329
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:54,133
She and her father went up
North Shore to get a pineapple.

330
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,743
Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy
suffered a serious head injury.

331
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:38,578
She lost her short-term memory.

332
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:41,016
So she can't remember anything?

333
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,852
No, no, no, she has all of her
long-term memory.

334
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:45,857
That's a different part
of the brain.

335
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:50,192
Her whole life, up to the night before
the accident, she remembers.

336
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:53,129
She just can't retain
any new information.

337
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:57,966
It's like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps.

338
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,439
Hold on. This sounds like something
I would tell a psycho girl...

339
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,204
...so she'd stop calling me.
Am I the psycho girl

340
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,279
I wish I was making this up!

341
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:09,212
She has no memory
that she ever met you.

342
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:11,443
What about the
pineapple -picking thing?

343
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,020
She says that every day,
because each morning...

344
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:17,488
...she wakes up thinking it's
October 13th of last year.

345
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,958
She comes for breakfast because
that's what she did on Sundays...

346
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,359
...and October 13th
was a Sunday.

347
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:27,161
She has no idea
it's more than a year later.

348
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:28,860
She reads the newspaper.

349
00:24:29,037 --> 00:24:31,972
It's a special paper her father
puts on their porch.

350
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,541
It's from the day of her accident.
He got hundreds of them printed.

351
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:40,507
Lucy does the same thing every day.

352
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:52,357
- Hello!
- Back here.

353
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:55,860
- Hi, Dad!
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

354
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,158
You got one without me.

355
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:02,425
The lady at the farmers' market
gave it to me as a birthday present.

356
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:05,232
I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

357
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:08,939
I think she likes you.

358
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:12,569
- Yeah, what's not to like?
- What about our tradition?

359
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:16,775
Well, I have another idea.
I painted my workshop yesterday.

360
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:19,349
White.

361
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:22,154
Now it's too white.
Gives me a headache.

362
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:24,884
Oh, yeah, you definitely
need some color in here.

363
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,052
Well, you know,
that's what I was thinking.

364
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:30,331
- Really?
- Yeah. Go nuts.

365
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:33,900
- Paint me something for my birthday.
- I will.

366
00:25:34,503 --> 00:25:37,870
And promise that we can pick
a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?

367
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,134
- Sounds great.
- Okay, good.

368
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,643
Hey, you should watch the Vikings
game while I' m painting.

369
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,211
Good idea.

370
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:55,612
- Yeah, baby. Isolate.
- What are we eating tonight, Doug?

371
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,282
- Spaghetti, Pop.
- Try not to sweat in the sauce.

372
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:00,260
Sorry, Pop.

373
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:08,992
Go Vikings.

374
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:13,170
Seven hundred and five.
Seven hundred and six.

375
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:15,640
- Seven hundred and seven.
- Hey, you guys.

376
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:18,004
Hey, sweetie.
How's the painting coming?

377
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,045
- You'll see.
- Cool

378
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:23,412
- Oh. What's the score?
- The Vikings are on the two-yard line.

379
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:27,521
- Lf they score, they bring it to 14-10.
- Maybe they'll win for your birthday.

380
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:30,755
And I' II bet Culpepper runs it in.

381
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:35,192
I'll bet he fakes a handoff to Williams,
throws to Kleinsasser in the end zone.

382
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:38,094
- Loser does the dishes?
- You're on.

383
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,200
- Keep the offense on the field.

384
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:43,133
Culpepper fakes a handoff
to Williams. He will throw.

385
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,274
He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
Touchdown, Minnesota.

386
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,840
Doug, you're good.

387
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,773
Maybe you should be a coach.

388
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:57,447
- Dad.
- Moron!

389
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,280
That hurt.

390
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,228
And you don't look a day over 25.

391
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:17,668
Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles
aren't pharmaceutically enhanced.

392
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,500
What? I use an herb supplement...

393
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:23,007
...that can be purchased at any
health-food store. Check this out.

394
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:25,976
Check out these glutes.
Rock-hard, baby.

395
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:27,476
Pretty sweet, huh?

396
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:30,413
Stop it! You're gonna make me
throw up on the cake.

397
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,075
Okay, just open your present.

398
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,087
Okay. Let's see what we've got here.

399
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,053
The Sixth Sense.

400
00:27:38,627 --> 00:27:42,154
Hey! When I' m done doing the dishes,
do you guys wanna watch it?

401
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,163
- Sure.
- Sure.

402
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,328
Ben Friedkin?

403
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:50,835
Some people, they call me freak.

404
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,244
- Ronald Sumner?
- I am. I am a freak. Look at me.

405
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:59,511
Just give me a chance...

406
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:07,546
I can't believe it.
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

407
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,917
I'm shocked.
Did you see that coming?

408
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,183
- No.
- Not a clue.

409
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,522
- Shocked as hell.
- Anyway, it was awesome.

410
00:28:14,696 --> 00:28:16,630
- Happy birthday.
- Love you, Sis.

411
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,598
Your muscles are getting so big, I can
barely wrap my arms around you.

412
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,532
You like that?
Check this out.

413
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:31,376
Okay, okay! Enough with the titty
dance! Let your sister go to sleep.

414
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:33,411
- I like it.
- Sweet dreams, Lucy.

415
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:35,641
- Good night.
- Good night.

416
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,396
Hey, Tracy, how you doing?

417
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,797
Yeah?

418
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,962
Well, things changed a little bit
since high school

419
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:04,169
And this is what happens
every single day.

420
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,864
How long it gonna take for
her memory to come back?

421
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:09,374
Her doctors say it may
never come back.

422
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:12,672
So, basically,
what you're saying is...

423
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:16,046
...she's perfect for you.
- What do you mean?

424
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:18,913
You can hang out all day with
no attachment, because...

425
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:22,022
Her plane leaves every night?
There's a problem with that.

426
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,851
- What is?
- It 's evil

427
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:25,253
No, it isn't.

428
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:28,794
You meet her, hang out, flirt,
no commitment, nobody gets hurt.

429
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:32,923
- She's got brain damage, you psycho.
- Okay, I' II give you that one.

430
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:34,932
But I think it'd be healthy for you.

431
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:38,095
You haven't allowed yourself
to connect with a girl

432
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:40,764
I appreciate your interest,
but leave me alone.

433
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:43,433
Hey, you'd be doing exactly
what her father does:

434
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:45,876
Giving her a wonderful day.

435
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:50,143
When it's time for you to go on your
big boat trip, poof, you just leave.

436
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:52,081
She'll never even know you're gone.

437
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:55,620
I'm not sure about the "poofing" part,
because I' m not a good poofer.

438
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,348
Demonstrate a good poof for me?

439
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:00,187
Quit busting my coconuts
for five seconds.

440
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:03,763
All right. Would you stop poofing
on that joint and do some work?

441
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:08,232
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready.

442
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:11,304
Then we're gonna take her
out for a spin.

443
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:16,836
Captain's log: November 7 th.
Nearly midnight.

444
00:31:17,012 --> 00:31:19,708
The Sea Serpent is fully
recovered from her mishap...

445
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:22,941
...and ready to once again
brave the open ocean.

446
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:28,317
I think my stitches
opened up again, cuz.

447
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,721
You got a cat?
Because I feel something licking me.

448
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:44,528
How is it?

449
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:46,868
Peanut Butter Cups.
What are you doing here?

450
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:49,408
I just wanted to say hi to Lucy.

451
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,577
I promise you I' m not gonna
do anything wrong.

452
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:54,976
What did Sue say?

453
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,677
She said that if I talk to Lucy,
you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.

454
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,845
She's the boss, cuz.
But don't worry.

455
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,457
Lucy probably didn't wanna
talk to you anyway.

456
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:08,425
- What does that mean?
- This ain't a disco.

457
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:11,531
She doesn't want guys hitting on her
during her breakfast.

458
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,490
She does if it's Henry Roth.

459
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:15,330
- Who that?
- Who that? Me that.

460
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:19,462
I bet you 20 bucks I can get her
to have breakfast with me again.

461
00:32:22,143 --> 00:32:24,634
- You're on.
- I love it.

462
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:29,315
- How you doing, honey?
- Hey, Sue. Nice haircut.

463
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:32,385
Oh, mahalo.
See you in a bit.

464
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:36,615
Nick and I have an arrangement.
You can trust me.

465
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,691
Don't worry.

466
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:03,483
You should try this out.
Put it in there.

467
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,812
Swivelly door.

468
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:08,387
Waffleonians can
come in and out now.

469
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:12,454
Are you from a country where it's
okay to stick your fingers...

470
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,219
...all over someone else's food?

471
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:17,593
No, I' m from this country.

472
00:33:17,766 --> 00:33:20,166
Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.

473
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:22,599
All right, well, have a good meal

474
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,304
- Yeah.
- That was pathetic.

475
00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:32,537
Yeah? Why don't you choke
on your Spam?

476
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:34,648
Double or nothing tomorrow.

477
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:44,655
Hey. I' m sorry to bother you...

478
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:47,693
...but you look like a person
who appreciates fine art...

479
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:49,591
...so I wanted your opinion.

480
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:56,226
I drew this. It 's a picture of a father
and son fishing off a fishing boat.

481
00:33:56,571 --> 00:33:58,232
There's a walrus right there...

482
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:06,771
Oh, you don't speak English. Okay.

483
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:12,076
Doesn't look Chinese.

484
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:14,380
Forty.

485
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,255
Can I have that?

486
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:20,258
I need something
to wipe my ass with.

487
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:21,893
Shut up.

488
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:49,156
I wonder what's the matter with him.

489
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:51,849
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

490
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,594
Excuse me. Okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.

491
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,794
- No, that's all right. L- -
- Are you okay?

492
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:06,770
Yeah, I' m fine. I' m having
a problem with something...

493
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:08,806
Something that I could help you with?

494
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:10,774
No, no, no. I just...

495
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:13,880
...can't read.

496
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,144
You gotta be kidding me.

497
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:19,343
- I can read that for you.
- No. Thank you.

498
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,283
I can do this on my own.

499
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:23,481
Appreciate the sentiment.

500
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:26,252
I'm gonna get an order of the...

501
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,131
Pan...

502
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:40,167
Pan...

503
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,968
Panku...

504
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:45,271
Ca...

505
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:47,405
Panclocks.

506
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:50,244
- Pancakes.
- Okay, I' II have pancake.

507
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:52,784
- Pancakes.
- Pancah... Pancakes! Pancakes!

508
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:54,546
- I' m so stupid!
- Oh, don't cry.

509
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:58,419
- Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- Don't cry.

510
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:01,357
- I don't know anything!
- What a loser.

511
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,664
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you sit with me?

512
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:11,362
You can have some breakfast and
I'll help teach you some of the words.

513
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,436
- Okay.
- All right.

514
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:15,508
- That sounds nice.
- Come on over.

515
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,702
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

516
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:27,184
So I comes before the E?

517
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:29,653
- Except after C?
- Yes.

518
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,622
Okay, and C is that little
half a squiggly one, right?

519
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,921
- Yes.
- I think I' m getting it.

520
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:38,588
- How'd you get so good at teaching?
- I' m a teacher. I do it all the time.

521
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,564
I'm an art teacher at
the Haluki-liki Junior High.

522
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:45,797
Well, you Haluki-liki the kind of
teacher all the kids have crushes on.

523
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:48,465
I know I would if I was in your class.

524
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,111
Okay.

525
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,910
Oh, boy, do my...
My fingers smell like fish.

526
00:36:57,085 --> 00:36:58,916
That doesn't gross you out, does it?

527
00:36:59,087 --> 00:37:00,850
No, not at all.

528
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:02,853
Really?

529
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:08,619
If Lucy gets hurt, I' m gonna chop you
with the meat cleaver.

530
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:10,388
Okay, okay.

531
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:13,860
So I had a nice time.

532
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:16,765
- Yeah, me too.
- Thank you very much.

533
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:18,667
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,398
Sure.

535
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,372
Okay.

536
00:37:29,317 --> 00:37:34,311
I just want to eat you up, tomorrow
and the next day, next day, next day...

537
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,424
I'll see you around.

538
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,287
Okay.

539
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:44,630
Really? That's it?

540
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:48,564
- That's what?
- All that flirting...

541
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:52,194
...and phony "I can't read" stuff,
and you're not gonna ask me out...

542
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:53,704
...or for my phone number?

543
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,173
- I can't read.
- Oh, shut up.

544
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:59,677
That was one of the goofiest things
I've ever seen, but I thought:

545
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,680
"Hey, if this guy is so desperate
to meet me...

546
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,216
...he might be worth talking to."

547
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,183
But then I get stiffed.

548
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:09,649
No, no, no,
this is what happened. I...

549
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:12,390
Mahalo for the ego boost.

550
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,654
- You're right. You're right. I feel like...
- No worries.

551
00:38:16,497 --> 00:38:18,522
I gotta...
I can read a little!

552
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:22,157
I didn't know I came before E!
That one I didn't know, I swear.

553
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:24,167
Oh, you idiot.

554
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:26,499
I hope you're happy, Shamu.

555
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:32,402
Marlin. It 's Sue.

556
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,723
- Oh, aloha, sir. My name's Henry...
- I know who you are.

557
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:53,534
- I want to apologize to your daughter.
- Not gonna happen.

558
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:56,192
She's inside.
We're gonna straighten things out.

559
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,669
Dad, the damn mongoose
got in the garbage again!

560
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,600
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

561
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:06,542
Mr. Roth, I have one simple request:

562
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:08,541
Stay away from my daughter.

563
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:12,277
Absolutely. I hurt her feelings
and don't want it to end like that.

564
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:13,750
It's gonna end like this.

565
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,546
Calm down, little fellow.

566
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:19,955
I'm gonna kill you! You're a dead man.
Okay, I' m calm.

567
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:21,720
I'm calm.

568
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:24,428
- Let me help you up.
- I got it! I got it.

569
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,093
It's just Dad and I work too hard
to protect Lucy to let some idiot ruin it.

570
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,898
I know what you guys do
and I totally respect that.

571
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:35,804
If you know her condition, you know
she can't have a normal relationship.

572
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:38,104
The next morning,
she won't know who he is.

573
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:40,372
And any guy who's okay with that...

574
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:42,038
...ain't okay with me.

575
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,209
- I' m not looking for a one-night stand.
- Anything with Lucy is, numb-nuts.

576
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:50,050
Give us a break.
Just stay away from the Hukilau Cafe.

577
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:52,626
My daughter's been through enough.

578
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:55,956
Okay. I' m sorry.

579
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:03,998
I could have whooped his ass,
but this gravel, I slipped on it...

580
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:07,073
Yeah, well, maybe you need to do
a few more butt flexes.

581
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,198
Cheap shot, Dad.

582
00:40:10,178 --> 00:40:11,839
So fresh and so clean.

583
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:15,107
Hey, Alexa, did you hook up
with that girl from the bar?

584
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:17,444
- I chickened out.
- Really?

585
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,610
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I prefer sausage to taco.

586
00:40:21,923 --> 00:40:24,448
- What?
- Yeah. No, I agree, buddy.

587
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:27,492
Get out of here.
Run for the hills.

588
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,093
Let me ask you something, Alexa.

589
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:33,256
If you promised a girl' s dad
that you wouldn't see her...

590
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:35,732
...would you consider that
a binding promise?

591
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:37,427
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

592
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:40,301
Then again, there are always ways
around such things.

593
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:42,237
- Like?
- For example...

594
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,676
...if I promised a woman's father
I would not see her...

595
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:50,715
...I would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood.

596
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:54,780
That's actually a cool way to look at it.

597
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,753
And a very gross way.

598
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:16,009
He asked me not to go to the Hukilau.
I'm not going there.

599
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:18,169
I'm not doing anything wrong.

600
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:27,381
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind of stuck here.

601
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:31,391
- Car trouble?
- Yeah. You mind giving me a jump?

602
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:33,392
Okay.

603
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:35,222
Appreciate your time.

604
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:37,091
Not everybody would have stopped.

605
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,290
- You're real sweet.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

606
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:48,164
I can't believe you fell for that.

607
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:52,170
Well, my grandfather died
trying to jump-start a car.

608
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:59,209
I'm sorry.
I was just joking around.

609
00:41:59,387 --> 00:42:02,788
I can't believe you fell for that!

610
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:04,652
Oh, my God.

611
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,383
That was very good.

612
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,721
- My name's Henry.
- I' m Lucy.

613
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:11,023
Nice to meet you.
You look like a nice...

614
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:20,437
Hi. Sorry for the delay.
Should be a few minutes.

615
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:23,099
- No problem. No worries.
- Where you coming from?

616
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,338
Breakfast?

617
00:42:25,513 --> 00:42:26,946
- Yeah.
- How was it?

618
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:28,911
I had waffles. They were delicious.

619
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,449
Ilike making little houses
out of waffles.

620
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,953
- You do?
- That's my thing.

621
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:39,457
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

622
00:42:39,627 --> 00:42:40,958
Hi, I' m Henry.

623
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:44,120
Okay, pal When she stops,
just let her pet you. Look cute.

624
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:47,461
Go to the middle of the road.
Thank you. Right there. Perfect.

625
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:56,841
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes. Smile.

626
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:01,671
Where is she?

627
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,784
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

628
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:10,821
Okay. That didn't work.

629
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:13,858
Shit your pants? So did I

630
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:21,335
Okay, this is her.
Start beating me up.

631
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:23,163
Make it look good.

632
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,067
Give me your wallet!

633
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:31,736
Okay, haole, what do you think?
You can come to this island...

634
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,813
...eat our pineapple...
- Help me! Not so hard.

635
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:37,007
- Take it easy.
- Try to bang our women.

636
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:39,515
Making my sister
clean your hotel room.

637
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:41,985
Okay. What's that have to do
with this? Relax.

638
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:44,647
- Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
- Stupid haole!

639
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:49,023
Yeah, that's right. Take that!
And that! And that!

640
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:50,686
And that! And that!

641
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:53,095
You got him. You got him.
Enough. Enough.

642
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:54,564
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes...

643
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:56,225
Okay, I' II be back.
Come here!

644
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:58,031
No, no! I think he's had enough.

645
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:00,464
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,772
My eye!

647
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:07,242
- You got him!
- Not good enough!

648
00:44:07,415 --> 00:44:08,677
Oh, Kamehameha!

649
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,908
He learned his lesson!

650
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,377
- What's your name?
- My name's Henry.

651
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:15,385
- You did good.
- Hi. Sorry.

652
00:44:15,556 --> 00:44:17,285
I'm in a community-watch program...

653
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,550
Oh, you crazy bitch!

654
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:21,490
Yeah, keep running!

655
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:24,062
Okay, okay, he's... He's gone now.

656
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:32,702
Not her. False alarm.

657
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:39,638
Don't worry, I called the cops already.
I'm all set.

658
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:42,408
Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?

659
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:47,019
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

660
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:50,715
When you're finished playing your
kidnap-victim crap on my daughter...

661
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:52,119
...come by the house.

662
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,386
Okay.

663
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:03,526
Oh, boy.

664
00:45:11,145 --> 00:45:12,908
There's something I wanna show you.

665
00:45:23,424 --> 00:45:26,518
We figured it out. She only sings
on days she meets you.

666
00:45:26,694 --> 00:45:28,662
You're kidding me. That song?

667
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:30,262
That's Mom and Dad's song.

668
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:33,457
When her mom was alive,
Lucy would have me take that tape...

669
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:36,228
...on every fishing trip I went on.
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,735
Yeah, she knew it would make me
miss her mom...

671
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:40,669
...and want to come home sooner.

672
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:45,005
I'm seeing a new side to you, sir.
I gotta tell you, it's grossing me out.

673
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,111
Let me ask you something.

674
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:51,513
What's in it for you?
What do you get out of this?

675
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:54,484
I don't know.

676
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:02,118
Wouldn't you want to spend
an hour a day with that?

677
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:05,129
Actually, no. She sings like shit.

678
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,990
- What?
- Can I ask you guys something?

679
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:10,968
What'll happen down the line?
Someday she'll wake up...

680
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:14,335
...look in the mirror and notice
she aged 10 years overnight.

681
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,735
You know something, Henry?

682
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:19,709
I worry about that
every damn day of my life.

683
00:46:24,718 --> 00:46:26,208
Pardon me.

684
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:29,481
Sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we
were both eating alone...

685
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:33,115
...and I thought I could sit with you,
maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi...

686
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:36,525
...for your waffle house?
- Oh, that would be nice...

687
00:46:36,697 --> 00:46:38,995
...but I have a boyfriend.

688
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,191
So I' m sorry.

689
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:45,403
You're making up a boyfriend
to get rid of me?

690
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:46,972
No, I' m not.

691
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:49,234
What's his name, then?

692
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,672
Ringo.

693
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:52,970
Is his last name Starr?

694
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:56,306
- No. McCartney.
- McCartney, okay.

695
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,815
- Oh, no.
- All right. I' m sorry.

696
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,386
No! This cop is writing me a ticket!

697
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:03,546
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go out there.

698
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,123
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Go on!

699
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:06,657
I'm coming.

700
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,818
The tags don't expire
for seven months.

701
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,794
- They expired May of this year.
- No! No, no!

702
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:13,456
They expire May of next year.

703
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:15,592
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

704
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:17,498
- I don't.
- This is ridiculous.

705
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:19,901
I'm not paying for this!
It's October!

706
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,731
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Look, October!

707
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:24,741
Lucy, let's go back inside.

708
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,642
What?

709
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:39,048
What?

710
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,659
Having a bad day, Doug!

711
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:30,605
Sweetheart...

712
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:33,175
...these are from the accident.

713
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:53,194
Oh, no!

714
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:02,707
I can feel it.

715
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:08,505
You were in the hospital
for three months, sweetheart.

716
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:25,826
I have to talk to this doctor.
I need to hear it from him.

717
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:27,990
You have heard it, sweetie.
Many times.

718
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:31,302
I have?

719
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,398
I'll take her.

720
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:38,571
I have to hear for myself too.

721
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:51,484
Doug, just take this, okay?
I can't...

722
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:54,320
I can't look at it anymore.

723
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:58,457
- It 's gonna be all right, Luce.
- Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.

724
00:49:58,899 --> 00:50:01,129
Sweetie, you're sort of dating him.

725
00:50:02,536 --> 00:50:04,902
Sorry I' m not better-looking.

726
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,568
What else happened
since last October?

727
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:13,543
- What about my students?
- Miss Campbell took over your class.

728
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:19,518
- Did Alicia marry that guy?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:22,052
Doug, did you win
the Mr. Hawaii contest?

730
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:24,520
I didn't know there was gonna be
a urine test.

731
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:26,286
Wow.

732
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:28,759
Do we have sex?

733
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:34,599
No, we don't.
Just so everybody knows that.

734
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,497
We want to.

735
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:39,633
Just kidding.

736
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:47,407
So you guys have to just lie
to me every day.

737
00:51:00,794 --> 00:51:02,921
Hey, Lucy.
Good to see you again.

738
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,293
What the hell 's her problem?

739
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:10,993
She doesn't remember
who you are, brah.

740
00:51:11,171 --> 00:51:13,036
Oh, yeah.

741
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:15,971
I suck at this job.

742
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:19,311
Lucy, these are your
brain scans here.

743
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,504
I'm afraid they show
no improvement.

744
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:24,173
The temporal lobe
was severely damaged.

745
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:27,582
What we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability...

746
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:31,417
...to convert short-term memory into
long-term memory while you sleep.

747
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:34,356
The condition's come to be known
as Goldfield Syndrome.

748
00:51:34,528 --> 00:51:37,725
- Who's Goldfield?
- A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.

749
00:51:37,898 --> 00:51:39,923
He himself suffered
temporal-lobe damage.

750
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,193
Took him four years
to publish his findings...

751
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:45,031
...because he had to keep
starting over from scratch.

752
00:51:45,505 --> 00:51:48,872
Obviously, your sense of humor
is still intact, and that's here.

753
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:50,805
Magnificent amygdala as well.

754
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:53,879
- Doctor, I have a question.
- I' d be happy to answer it...

755
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:58,450
...but as I' ve told you before, this is a
hygienic facility. Shirts are required.

756
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,052
- Oh, okay.
- Nice move.

757
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:03,850
Listen, doctor, this...

758
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:07,653
...friend of mine's been experimenting
a little with steroids.

759
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:09,693
He's been having a lot
of wet dreams.

760
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,155
Could there be a connection
between them?

761
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:14,163
Douglas, get off the juice.

762
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:17,360
As for the nocturnal emissions,
why don't you take a swim...

763
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:21,405
...buy a shirt with no holes,
find a wahine and take her to dinner.

764
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:23,770
I'll tell my friend you said so.

765
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,208
In any case, Lucy,
your condition is stable...

766
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:28,973
...but most likely permanent.

767
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,350
I'm so sorry, dear.

768
00:52:31,718 --> 00:52:33,413
But it could be worse.

769
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:36,387
Yeah? How?

770
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:39,389
I think you should meet
Ten Second Tom.

771
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:43,524
Callahan Institute is the leading
brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.

772
00:52:43,697 --> 00:52:46,962
We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio
by T.B. Callahan...

773
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:50,399
...the automotive-components tycoon
and philanthropist.

774
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:57,867
And now, I would like
to introduce to you...

775
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:00,878
...our most distinguished
clinical subject...

776
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:02,447
...Tom.

777
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:04,208
- Hi. I' m Tom.
- Henry.

778
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:05,612
- Marlin.
- Doug.

779
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,014
- Lucy.
- Hi.

780
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,348
Cool flip-flops.
Where'd you get them?

781
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:12,549
You like those? It 's interesting.
I was on the North Shore...

782
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:13,954
Hi, I' m Tom.

783
00:53:14,761 --> 00:53:16,729
- Henry.
- Hi.

784
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:18,888
- Marlin.
- Tom lost part of his brain...

785
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:21,762
...in a hunting accident.
His memory lasts 10 seconds.

786
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:23,732
I was in an accident? That's terrible.

787
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:26,031
Don't worry.
You'll get over it in seconds.

788
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:29,664
Get over it? I mean, what happened?
Did I get shot in the brain?

789
00:53:29,843 --> 00:53:32,073
- Hi, I' m Tom.
- Hi, I' m Lucy.

790
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:33,507
- Hi.
- Doug.

791
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,908
- Hey.
- Marlin.

792
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:37,607
Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?

793
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:43,147
Don't you think you're a little old
to still have wet dreams?

794
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:49,626
- They liked that.
- Hi, I' m Tom.

795
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:52,128
- Yeah, watch yourself, Tom.
- Easy.

796
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:08,746
- I' m gonna go to sleep.
- All right. Good night.

797
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:11,509
Good night, you guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

798
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:15,580
- And I guess I' II see you too?
- Oh, yeah.

799
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:18,248
You had a rough day today.
I'm sorry.

800
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,620
I hope you get some rest tonight.

801
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:22,619
Okay.

802
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:24,286
Good night.

803
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:25,893
So how you getting home?

804
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:28,159
- You gonna take the Likelike or...
- Hey.

805
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:33,367
Thank you for being
so nice to me today.

806
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,100
- Sure.
- I don't want you to...

807
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:37,971
...strike out tomorrow.

808
00:54:38,145 --> 00:54:40,010
So maybe you could talk
to me about...

809
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:41,976
...lilies.

810
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:43,610
Lilies?

811
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:45,513
I'm a sucker for lilies.

812
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:47,479
Thanks for the tip.

813
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:49,144
Good night.

814
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:50,653
Good night.

815
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:53,322
My, oh, my.

816
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:55,484
- Lover-boy.
- Yes, sir.

817
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:57,857
You don't have to rush off.
Stick around.

818
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:00,989
You've earned yourself
a couple beers.

819
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,196
So what'll you do when
you finish the boat?

820
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:06,236
Actually, I' m going on a trip soon...

821
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:08,806
...to study undersea
Pacific walrus behaviors.

822
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:10,306
Sounds kind of fruity.

823
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,707
- Thank you.
- How long is it gonna take?

824
00:55:12,879 --> 00:55:14,107
About a year.

825
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:16,112
Guess you won't miss days like this.

826
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,546
Well, maybe days like this
don't have to be so bad.

827
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:21,550
What are you trying to say?

828
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:24,021
When you guys tell her...

829
00:55:24,191 --> 00:55:26,716
...she's not just finding out
about the accident.

830
00:55:26,893 --> 00:55:30,226
She's finding out that her life
is basically a setup.

831
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:32,365
I think that freaks her out the most.

832
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:33,931
- You're an expert now?
- No.

833
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:36,535
I'm saying I wish there was
another way besides:

834
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,400
"Sorry we couldn't trick you today.
Here's pictures of your broken head."

835
00:55:40,574 --> 00:55:42,940
- You want a broken head?
- You'll give him one?

836
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,271
No, Daddy, I thought
you was gonna do it.

837
00:55:45,712 --> 00:55:48,476
Nobody's gotta break my head.
I'm gonna split anyways.

838
00:55:48,648 --> 00:55:51,208
Oh, don't go just because
my son is psychotic.

839
00:55:51,384 --> 00:55:54,683
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Keep them dry there, Doug.

840
00:55:55,155 --> 00:55:56,952
Very funny.

841
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:20,873
- Excuse me. Lucy Whitmore?
- Yes?

842
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:23,447
I have a delivery for you.

843
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,111
- A delivery for me?
- Yes.

844
00:56:28,054 --> 00:56:30,852
Oh, they're beautiful

845
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:33,558
- Who are they from?
- That I can't tell you.

846
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:37,356
It's a secret admirer.
He also wants you to have this.

847
00:56:37,797 --> 00:56:41,130
- Who's your friend, Lucy?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

848
00:56:41,301 --> 00:56:43,599
We just met, but look.

849
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:45,768
I have a secret admirer.

850
00:56:45,939 --> 00:56:48,567
Oh, really? What's this?

851
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,232
It's a videotape.

852
00:56:50,644 --> 00:56:52,134
A videotape of what?

853
00:56:52,279 --> 00:56:54,440
I have no idea.

854
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:56,845
But I have to find out.

855
00:56:57,717 --> 00:56:59,207
Happy birthday, Daddy.

856
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:02,412
- Thank you, sweetie.
- That's right. Happy birthday, sir.

857
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,523
- What are you, 200 today?
- That's cute.

858
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:07,717
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to try something different.

859
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:10,328
If it doesn't work,
we've only wasted one day.

860
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:31,879
Marha Stewar faced charges...

861
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:35,620
Oh, God!

862
00:58:16,696 --> 00:58:18,391
Okay, I think it's on. Go. Go.

863
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:20,726
Aloha! I'm Henry Roth.

864
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,896
We met here at the Hukilau Cafe
about a year after your accident.

865
00:58:27,073 --> 00:58:30,099
I like you and you like me, most days.

866
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,875
Every day is different, but basically
this is what happens, Lucy.

867
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:35,480
Kikikoloko, take the camera.

868
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:36,911
- I got it.
- Don't drop it.

869
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,108
Okay, all right.
Here we are, right here.

870
00:58:39,286 --> 00:58:41,550
The par of you in this reenactment...

871
00:58:41,721 --> 00:58:44,383
...will be played
by my good friend, Ula.

872
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:47,785
Aloha. Sorry about your brain.

873
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:49,627
I had a accident too.

874
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:52,697
Believe it or not, this my good eye.

875
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:54,861
- We ready?
- Yeah.

876
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:58,732
Hi. I like that waffle teepee
that you have built.

877
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:02,807
Oh! So nice of you to notice.
Please, sit down.

878
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:04,944
I would love to.

879
00:59:05,845 --> 00:59:07,506
My name is Henry, by the way.

880
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:09,581
My name is Lucy.

881
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:11,774
Smell my fingers?

882
00:59:12,986 --> 00:59:14,544
Fish. Right on.

883
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:18,247
So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium.

884
00:59:18,425 --> 00:59:20,985
Aquariums make me super horny.

885
00:59:21,161 --> 00:59:23,823
That's not funny.
Don't rub those.

886
00:59:23,997 --> 00:59:25,988
Sorry, Mr. Whitmore,
if you're watching.

887
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,225
It's very late,
and my friend's unstable.

888
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:31,097
Come on, stop with the licking!
You're making me sick.

889
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:32,795
Lucy, I'm sorry.

890
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:37,500
Anyways, I know you wish I was
making all this stuff up.

891
00:59:37,677 --> 00:59:39,838
I wish I was too.

892
00:59:40,814 --> 00:59:42,441
But the good news is...

893
00:59:42,615 --> 00:59:44,776
...so many people out there
care about you:

894
00:59:44,951 --> 00:59:48,614
Your dad and Doug and a couple
of your friends here at the Hukilau...

895
00:59:48,788 --> 00:59:50,449
...who have a message for you.

896
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:54,559
Lucy, as you know,
your mother and I were best friends.

897
00:59:55,628 --> 00:59:59,689
That's why I promised her that
I would always help look after you.

898
01:00:01,334 --> 01:00:04,303
Sometimes life isn't very fair...

899
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:07,129
...but we still have you.

900
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:13,444
Oh, and if you're wondering about
this guy who's making this tape...

901
01:00:14,214 --> 01:00:16,842
...he's okay.

902
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:20,679
Hey, Lucy. Just so you know,
since you lost your memory...

903
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:23,550
...I became governor of Hawaii.

904
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,323
No, just kidding. I'm too smar.

905
01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:32,664
Kualaliku! Get your brother
off the dishwasher!

906
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:36,559
So whenever you're ready,
we'd all love to talk to you...

907
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:38,670
...and answer any questions
you have...

908
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:41,671
...and you're the best, Lucy. Aloha.

909
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:59,048
How many times
have I watched this?

910
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:01,049
This is the first time.

911
01:01:06,232 --> 01:01:09,065
Okay, she cried for about an hour.
That's not too bad.

912
01:01:09,235 --> 01:01:12,830
I bet in another hour she'll be ready
to see her friends, have lunch...

913
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:14,234
...get her life back.

914
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:16,341
We could do this every day.

915
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:21,074
We'll leave it up to her.

916
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:22,771
All right.

917
01:01:26,085 --> 01:01:28,280
So how's the cow?

918
01:01:28,455 --> 01:01:31,686
Same as you. Every day they
have to convince her she's a cow.

919
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:39,192
Wow, look. The bark is healing.

920
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:41,424
You're gonna get there.

921
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:44,263
I never hung out with you
in the afternoon like this.

922
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:46,928
In this lighting, man, oh, man,
you look...

923
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,367
...disgusting.

924
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,537
Yeah.

925
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:56,546
I don't know how you get me to fall for
that egg-shaped head every morning.

926
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:59,651
All I have to do is slide on
my designer jeans...

927
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:03,346
...and just kind of wiggle
in front of you. You go nuts.

928
01:02:04,824 --> 01:02:08,487
Why couldn't I have met you one day
before the accident?

929
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:12,290
Don't worry, because if you hung out
with me for more than one day...

930
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:14,592
...you'd realize I' m a bore.

931
01:02:14,767 --> 01:02:16,962
- Oh, well, I have news for you.
- Yes?

932
01:02:17,136 --> 01:02:19,070
It takes less than one day.

933
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,230
You know something?
That hurt.

934
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:24,308
Your damaged temporal lobe
is causing me pain...

935
01:02:24,477 --> 01:02:26,308
...and I' m gonna get you for that.

936
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,614
Now you're dead!

937
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:51,330
- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- I know.

938
01:02:51,504 --> 01:02:54,530
- And I got her on the first try.
- Yeah. Easy.

939
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:56,504
And, Tammy, you are so thin.

940
01:02:56,676 --> 01:02:58,007
Thanks, Luce.

941
01:02:58,177 --> 01:02:59,974
And I' m so glad you finally got...

942
01:03:00,146 --> 01:03:03,343
...that gender-reassignment surgery,
Jennifer. I mean, Jonathan.

943
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:05,444
Mahalo.

944
01:03:06,352 --> 01:03:07,876
- Here you go, Lucy.
- Thank you.

945
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:10,249
- You're welcome.
- You must be Lucy's friend.

946
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:13,915
- The one who made the tape.
- I think he's more than my friend.

947
01:03:14,093 --> 01:03:16,118
- You're my boyfriend, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

948
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,992
So every day you help her
to realize what happened...

949
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:21,929
...and you wait patiently for her
to be okay with it...

950
01:03:22,101 --> 01:03:24,160
...then get her to fall in love
with you again?

951
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:25,966
Yes, ma'am.

952
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,668
You asshole!

953
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:31,901
You don't even open the fricking car
door for me anymore.

954
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:33,910
You're in trouble.

955
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:37,008
I gotta go tinkle.

956
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:44,646
Okay, so tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

957
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:46,883
Okay. Well, I' ve...

958
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,257
...won over seven all -you-can-eat
chicken-wing contests.

959
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,557
- Really?
- Yes.

960
01:03:52,732 --> 01:03:55,758
And I' m a ballet dancer,
but only in my bathroom.

961
01:03:56,135 --> 01:03:58,569
No, what do you want to know?

962
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,898
Do you love me?

963
01:04:05,111 --> 01:04:06,976
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

964
01:04:07,146 --> 01:04:09,910
I was just asking more for
informational purposes.

965
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:12,415
It's to keep the video as up-to-date
as possible.

966
01:04:12,585 --> 01:04:14,246
Sure.

967
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:19,424
Well, love is a very loaded word.

968
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:23,952
Let's see. I...

969
01:04:24,464 --> 01:04:29,766
I go to this restaurant every morning,
and I see you there, reading.

970
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:32,001
And...

971
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:36,932
Ilove you very much.

972
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,538
Probably more than anybody could
love another person.

973
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:47,078
And how do I feel about you?

974
01:04:47,787 --> 01:04:50,278
You're excited about
the chicken-wing thing.

975
01:04:51,057 --> 01:04:52,854
And...

976
01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:56,223
...you've been dying to make out
with me for some time now.

977
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:09,297
Feeling better now?

978
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:12,308
Nothing beats a first kiss.

979
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:23,014
There's nothing like a first kiss.

980
01:05:45,545 --> 01:05:47,672
Nothing beats a first kiss.

981
01:05:47,847 --> 01:05:50,008
That's what I' ve heard.

982
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,814
Nothing beats a first...

983
01:06:08,434 --> 01:06:09,696
What are you doing?

984
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:12,360
Nothing. I was just getting
some lint off for you.

985
01:06:12,538 --> 01:06:14,506
You were going for a feelski!

986
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:19,577
All right, I' m sorry, but this is like the
23rd time we've made out already...

987
01:06:19,746 --> 01:06:21,236
...and they're getting blue.

988
01:06:21,848 --> 01:06:24,339
I know. I know.

989
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:27,385
I mean, I really don't know.

990
01:06:27,553 --> 01:06:30,488
For me, it still feels like the first time.

991
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:32,351
Okay, let's average it out then.

992
01:06:32,525 --> 01:06:35,460
It's the 23rd time for me
and the first time for you.

993
01:06:35,628 --> 01:06:37,960
- That's about our 12th time.
- Yeah?

994
01:06:38,131 --> 01:06:41,100
Now, Hawaiian law clearly states
after the 12th date...

995
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:44,498
...I' m entitled to unlimited
boob access.

996
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:49,771
Why didn't I meet you one day
before the accident?

997
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:53,276
You say that all the time.

998
01:06:53,446 --> 01:06:55,414
You want to meet a friend of mine?

999
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:00,910
All right.

1000
01:07:02,054 --> 01:07:05,785
Jocko, this is Lucy.
Lucy, this is Jocko.

1001
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:09,752
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1002
01:07:10,663 --> 01:07:13,188
He is awesome! He is so smart.

1003
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:17,598
Check this out. Jocko, what does
the teapot do when the water's ready?

1004
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:22,707
- Very good.
- Can I ask him a question?

1005
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,433
Go ahead.

1006
01:07:24,977 --> 01:07:26,638
Jocko...

1007
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:30,510
...do you think that Henry and I
are ready to take our relationship...

1008
01:07:30,683 --> 01:07:32,480
...to the next level

1009
01:07:34,153 --> 01:07:35,916
You sure about that?

1010
01:07:36,656 --> 01:07:39,386
Do you think I should bring him
into the other room...

1011
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:41,993
...and take advantage of him?

1012
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:49,764
I saw that hand gesture.

1013
01:07:49,936 --> 01:07:51,904
- And I' m glad you did it.
- Really?

1014
01:08:04,383 --> 01:08:06,351
- Use that.
- Oh, wow. Look!

1015
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:07,747
- Yeah.
- They're...

1016
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,354
They're nodding in approval, I hope.

1017
01:08:10,523 --> 01:08:12,889
They like you. Let me get them
out of there.

1018
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:16,119
Mary-Kate, Ashley, get a life.
Thank you. Sorry.

1019
01:08:16,295 --> 01:08:19,526
- Oh, they're very nice, though.
- Yeah, so are you.

1020
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:21,826
Let me get you down slow.

1021
01:08:22,001 --> 01:08:24,435
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1022
01:08:47,193 --> 01:08:50,629
All right, I just wrote this,
so go easy on me.

1023
01:08:51,597 --> 01:08:55,226
The Hukilau was the place

1024
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:58,803
Where I first saw your face

1025
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:03,568
We liked each other right away

1026
01:09:05,378 --> 01:09:09,508
But you didn't remember me
The very next day

1027
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:14,645
Forgetful Lucy

1028
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:18,381
Has got a nice caboose-y

1029
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:24,023
I used to trick you into pulling
Your car over so we could chat

1030
01:09:24,196 --> 01:09:28,565
But my favorite time was when you
Beat the shit out of Ula with a bat

1031
01:09:29,101 --> 01:09:32,537
And we drove up to see Dr. Keats

1032
01:09:33,072 --> 01:09:36,439
And found out why Doug always
Has to change his sheets

1033
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:42,038
Forgetful Lucy

1034
01:09:42,214 --> 01:09:46,708
Cracked her head like Gary Busey

1035
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:49,683
But I still love her so

1036
01:09:51,223 --> 01:09:54,488
And I'll never let her go

1037
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:59,461
Even if while I'm singing this song

1038
01:10:00,232 --> 01:10:03,531
She's wishing I had
Jocko the Walus' schlong

1039
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:09,774
Forgetful Lucy

1040
01:10:09,942 --> 01:10:14,003
Her lips are so damn juicy

1041
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:18,776
How about another first kiss

1042
01:10:29,195 --> 01:10:31,322
Can't fall asleep.

1043
01:10:31,564 --> 01:10:33,532
I'm not sleeping.

1044
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:36,497
I'm just closing my eyes.

1045
01:10:36,669 --> 01:10:38,899
Well, I' m gonna go downstairs then.

1046
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:43,269
No, no. I' m just resting.

1047
01:10:45,378 --> 01:10:46,970
Lucy.

1048
01:10:47,146 --> 01:10:48,773
Yeah.

1049
01:10:48,948 --> 01:10:50,939
Will you marry me?

1050
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,657
- Of course.
- Good.

1051
01:11:02,194 --> 01:11:04,788
Don't forget about me.

1052
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:07,663
Never.

1053
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:26,016
Good morning.

1054
01:11:32,758 --> 01:11:33,986
Oh, shit!

1055
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,321
- Help! Help!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lucy.

1056
01:11:36,495 --> 01:11:39,328
Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey.

1057
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:41,728
I know this is hard for you
to understand...

1058
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:44,233
...but we are actually
seeing each other.

1059
01:11:44,403 --> 01:11:46,234
We have been for a while now.

1060
01:11:46,405 --> 01:11:47,633
Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

1061
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,101
If I was lying,
how would I know this?

1062
01:11:50,276 --> 01:11:53,439
You're an art teacher and you go
to the Hukilau every Sunday...

1063
01:11:53,612 --> 01:11:57,173
...and you make waffle houses
and you like Casablanca lilies.

1064
01:11:57,349 --> 01:12:00,716
- Stalker!
- No, don't you remember me a little?

1065
01:12:07,993 --> 01:12:10,723
I may not be able to kick your ass,
but my sister can.

1066
01:12:10,896 --> 01:12:12,158
Thanks, buddy.

1067
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:15,095
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up,
but she'll be okay.

1068
01:12:15,267 --> 01:12:17,098
She's watching the tape as we speak.

1069
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:19,362
How's my temporal lobe
looking there, doc?

1070
01:12:19,538 --> 01:12:22,939
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer
any short-term memory loss.

1071
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:26,044
But was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you?

1072
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:29,545
Don't make fun of Henry.
It's not his fault it's shaped like that.

1073
01:12:29,715 --> 01:12:33,082
Note the intense overreaction.
That's the "roids" talking.

1074
01:12:33,419 --> 01:12:37,116
- Doug, once again, off the juice.
- It 's not juice.

1075
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:39,120
It's a protein shake.

1076
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:43,292
Henry, the boys tell me you're setting
sail for Alaska to study walruses.

1077
01:12:43,462 --> 01:12:46,260
- When does that adventure begin?
- That actually began...

1078
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:50,459
...ten years ago. That's when I started
planning and building my boat.

1079
01:12:50,636 --> 01:12:54,766
All I know is, out of all mammals,
they have the second-largest penis.

1080
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,766
I have the first.

1081
01:12:59,745 --> 01:13:01,076
That's my joke.

1082
01:13:01,247 --> 01:13:03,044
Did you tell Lucy about this trip?

1083
01:13:03,816 --> 01:13:05,306
Well...

1084
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:09,319
...actually, there's nothing to tell
because I decided not to go.

1085
01:13:09,488 --> 01:13:11,285
I mean, Lucy needs me here.

1086
01:13:11,457 --> 01:13:14,654
I'm just worried about
going away for a year...

1087
01:13:14,827 --> 01:13:17,125
...and ruining all the progress
she's made.

1088
01:13:17,296 --> 01:13:18,786
I know you think I' m crazy...

1089
01:13:18,964 --> 01:13:20,727
...but I think deep down inside...

1090
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,392
...she's starting to remember me.
- No, Henry.

1091
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,131
That's what you want to believe.
It's what we all want to believe.

1092
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:30,131
But it's never gonna happen.

1093
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:36,740
Okay. I gotta go to work.

1094
01:13:37,216 --> 01:13:39,810
Will you tell her I' II be back later
to pick her up?

1095
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:43,250
See you, guys. Don't tell anyone
your sister beat me up.

1096
01:13:43,923 --> 01:13:47,654
He could go to the moon and back and
Lucy would never even know he left.

1097
01:13:47,826 --> 01:13:50,989
Sometimes I wish my wife
had Goldfield Syndrome.

1098
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:54,499
That way she wouldn't remember
when I called her mother...

1099
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:58,967
...a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face
like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.

1100
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:04,501
All right. There's your medicine,
little fellow.

1101
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:07,806
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool

1102
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:12,110
If that's one of your special brownies,
don't let any of the dolphins eat that.

1103
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:15,720
How do you think I get them to
double flip and play with white kids?

1104
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:20,789
Okay, Willie, that's it.

1105
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,554
This time try to stay clean
for more than a day.

1106
01:14:23,729 --> 01:14:25,924
I made you a nice anchovy sundae.

1107
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:27,963
Okay, enjoy that.

1108
01:14:28,267 --> 01:14:29,757
Henry?

1109
01:14:30,502 --> 01:14:32,732
- Hey!
- How's your head?

1110
01:14:32,905 --> 01:14:36,068
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

1111
01:14:36,242 --> 01:14:38,267
What brings your royal cuteness
out here?

1112
01:14:38,444 --> 01:14:39,843
I needed to see you.

1113
01:14:40,346 --> 01:14:41,836
Okay. What you got there?

1114
01:14:42,481 --> 01:14:45,143
It's my journal I write in it every night.

1115
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:48,081
- Oh, you don't like the video?
- No, I love it.

1116
01:14:48,254 --> 01:14:52,623
It's just sometimes when I watch it,
I feel like I' m being told about my life...

1117
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:55,282
...from someone else.
And when I read this...

1118
01:14:55,427 --> 01:14:58,157
...it's like I' m telling myself.

1119
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,854
When did you start this up?

1120
01:15:00,332 --> 01:15:02,266
Right after you gave me the video.

1121
01:15:02,601 --> 01:15:04,933
- Really?
- I was so nervous to come here...

1122
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:08,437
...and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day.

1123
01:15:08,774 --> 01:15:11,834
Well, you probably thought
I couldn't live up to the hype.

1124
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:15,708
No. I was nervous because...

1125
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:20,047
Because I came here
to break up with you.

1126
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:25,514
You had plans and a life...

1127
01:15:25,691 --> 01:15:28,421
...before you met me
and now all you have time for...

1128
01:15:28,594 --> 01:15:30,892
...is to make me fall in love with you.

1129
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:34,065
That's not all I do.
I gave a penguin a bath today.

1130
01:15:37,102 --> 01:15:39,036
Which I' II have to do again tomorrow.

1131
01:15:39,204 --> 01:15:43,834
Ilook at my dad and my brother's
lives and I won't do that to you.

1132
01:15:44,009 --> 01:15:48,378
What do you want me to do? Be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go?

1133
01:15:48,547 --> 01:15:50,037
No.

1134
01:15:51,116 --> 01:15:57,544
My plan is to erase you completely,
so it's as if you never existed.

1135
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,752
Why are you doing this?

1136
01:16:02,695 --> 01:16:06,961
Because you have to understand
that there is no future with me.

1137
01:16:07,132 --> 01:16:12,229
Don't you want to have a career
and marriage and children?

1138
01:16:12,404 --> 01:16:14,599
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.

1139
01:16:14,773 --> 01:16:16,604
Kids? Yeah, I' d love to do it.

1140
01:16:17,676 --> 01:16:20,543
But how is that going to work?

1141
01:16:20,713 --> 01:16:24,979
I'm gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory...

1142
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:26,447
...of how it happened?

1143
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,421
I have to make a new journal
that doesn't have you in it.

1144
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:33,387
But before I do...

1145
01:16:33,559 --> 01:16:36,289
...I really want you to read
what I wrote about you.

1146
01:16:36,462 --> 01:16:38,327
I will read about it tomorrow...

1147
01:16:38,497 --> 01:16:41,591
...when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff, okay?

1148
01:16:42,134 --> 01:16:45,535
I'm not going to forget it.
I wrote it down. I won't let myself.

1149
01:16:45,704 --> 01:16:48,673
And I' m gonna do it whether
you want me to or not.

1150
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,506
I'll be at my house.

1151
01:16:59,518 --> 01:17:01,713
Okay, type this one in there.

1152
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:03,917
Saturday, November 25th.

1153
01:17:04,089 --> 01:17:08,890
I drove out to Callahan Institute today
and had a talk with Dr. Keats.

1154
01:17:09,828 --> 01:17:11,625
There's one about me.

1155
01:17:11,797 --> 01:17:15,995
Reminder: He makes funny noises
when I kiss his neck.

1156
01:17:16,969 --> 01:17:18,527
I'm gonna miss that.

1157
01:17:18,704 --> 01:17:20,899
You sure you don't want me
to put that in?

1158
01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:31,576
- We can skip that one.
- No, let me read it.

1159
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:36,016
We made love tonight! It didn't
last long, but it was incredible.

1160
01:17:38,857 --> 01:17:43,260
It's not all about how long you go. It 's...
There was a connection, I thought.

1161
01:17:44,463 --> 01:17:46,192
Actually, let's just rip that out.

1162
01:18:08,987 --> 01:18:11,353
Well, that's that.

1163
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:21,223
Henry, wait!

1164
01:18:27,272 --> 01:18:30,264
Could I have one last first kiss?

1165
01:19:42,281 --> 01:19:45,808
- I ain't gonna do this, Marlin.
- You have to, Henry.

1166
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:22,245
I'm gonna miss you, but I gotta
get the hell off this island.

1167
01:20:22,521 --> 01:20:24,045
I'm sorry I can't take you...

1168
01:20:24,222 --> 01:20:28,249
...but you've lived here so long you're
too big of a pansy to defend yourself.

1169
01:20:29,828 --> 01:20:33,525
I don't feel bad for you. I know you
got a thing going on with Candace.

1170
01:20:37,436 --> 01:20:38,926
Candace and Bernice?

1171
01:20:41,173 --> 01:20:43,038
Candace, Bernice and Rose?

1172
01:20:45,243 --> 01:20:48,872
Yeah. I fell for one chick and I' m losing
my mind. Good luck with that.

1173
01:20:49,181 --> 01:20:50,580
Okay, baby.

1174
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:52,577
Ilove you.

1175
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:55,442
Thanks, buddy.
Remember to use a condom.

1176
01:20:55,587 --> 01:20:57,578
Or in your case, a Hefty bag.

1177
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,633
Well...

1178
01:21:10,002 --> 01:21:13,096
Okay, you guys. Thanks for coming
to say goodbye.

1179
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,167
Be careful

1180
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:18,275
You make sure your father doesn't
get eaten by a shark.

1181
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:27,985
Thank you, buddy.
What does that mean again?

1182
01:21:28,253 --> 01:21:30,050
Bring me back a T-shirt.

1183
01:21:30,222 --> 01:21:32,554
Oh, okay. You got it.

1184
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:35,320
Come here. All right. Love you guys.

1185
01:21:36,228 --> 01:21:39,163
My shirt size is medium husky.

1186
01:21:41,366 --> 01:21:43,664
Hey! Kikikuloa!

1187
01:21:43,835 --> 01:21:46,633
No flippies off the dock!
You could get hurt!

1188
01:21:49,307 --> 01:21:54,176
No! All right. Let the master
show you how to get it done.

1189
01:22:02,454 --> 01:22:06,083
Now you kids go down there
and find my nuts.

1190
01:22:06,491 --> 01:22:08,322
Sure you don't want to take Doug?

1191
01:22:08,493 --> 01:22:12,122
Hey! What the heck
are you guys doing here?

1192
01:22:12,297 --> 01:22:16,859
I spoke to the harbormaster and he
said you were setting sail today...

1193
01:22:17,035 --> 01:22:19,265
...so we thought we'd wish
you bon voyage.

1194
01:22:19,538 --> 01:22:22,530
This is from Nick and Sue.
They send their best wishes.

1195
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:26,542
That's very nice.
Spam and Reese's. All right.

1196
01:22:26,712 --> 01:22:29,112
Ilove Spam and Reese's.
Can I have it?

1197
01:22:29,381 --> 01:22:30,973
I guess.

1198
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,843
- Doug!
- That's all right.

1199
01:22:34,019 --> 01:22:37,045
- I' m sorry.
- So...

1200
01:22:38,056 --> 01:22:39,318
...how's Lucy?

1201
01:22:39,925 --> 01:22:42,655
Actually, she's living at the institute.

1202
01:22:43,562 --> 01:22:46,929
- When did that happen?
- Three weeks ago.

1203
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:51,297
Said she didn't want to be a burden to
me and Doug anymore. I don't know.

1204
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,961
I couldn't talk her out of it.
You know what?

1205
01:22:54,106 --> 01:22:56,301
She's doing really great up there.

1206
01:22:56,475 --> 01:22:59,535
She's teaching an art class
and she gets to paint every day.

1207
01:22:59,878 --> 01:23:01,709
In fact, she's even singing again.

1208
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,075
Hey, look, I got a little gift
for you too.

1209
01:23:04,249 --> 01:23:08,049
It's just a little something
from one sailor to another one.

1210
01:23:10,155 --> 01:23:12,089
You take care of yourself out there.

1211
01:23:12,257 --> 01:23:14,691
- I will.
- Okay.

1212
01:23:23,435 --> 01:23:25,369
Henry did not tell me about you.

1213
01:23:25,637 --> 01:23:28,231
Your fisherman muscles.

1214
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,002
Can I touch?

1215
01:23:30,642 --> 01:23:32,473
Sure.

1216
01:23:37,949 --> 01:23:39,883
Yes.

1217
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:48,889
The Beach Boys?

1218
01:23:49,227 --> 01:23:52,094
How nice of him to give me a CD
that will remind me...

1219
01:23:52,264 --> 01:23:55,722
...of all the wonderful times
I shared with his daughter.

1220
01:23:55,901 --> 01:23:58,301
What an asshole!

1221
01:24:16,922 --> 01:24:18,947
Oh, why?

1222
01:24:19,624 --> 01:24:21,956
Why would you do this to me?

1223
01:24:22,127 --> 01:24:24,652
You sick bastard!

1224
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:30,725
Oh, my God.

1225
01:24:31,503 --> 01:24:33,437
Is he trying to tell me something?

1226
01:24:38,276 --> 01:24:40,710
She only sings on days
she meets you.

1227
01:24:42,581 --> 01:24:44,549
She remembers me?

1228
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:46,675
Holy shit!

1229
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:50,583
She remembers me!

1230
01:24:55,894 --> 01:24:57,589
Julia, that looks great.

1231
01:24:57,762 --> 01:25:00,094
Excuse me. What am I doing?

1232
01:25:00,398 --> 01:25:03,663
You're painting a picture.
And you're doing an excellent job.

1233
01:25:03,835 --> 01:25:05,462
Oh.

1234
01:25:06,972 --> 01:25:09,998
Holy crap! I suck.

1235
01:25:18,617 --> 01:25:20,312
Hey, hey, hey.

1236
01:25:20,485 --> 01:25:23,318
- Can we help you, sir?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

1237
01:25:23,488 --> 01:25:25,922
- What's your name?
- My name?

1238
01:25:28,627 --> 01:25:31,824
Dude, he forgot his name.
I feel bad for him.

1239
01:25:31,997 --> 01:25:34,898
Just go on up. And good luck
with that memory problem.

1240
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,191
Yeah. Thank you.

1241
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,367
What?

1242
01:25:40,939 --> 01:25:43,032
Lucy!

1243
01:25:43,608 --> 01:25:45,303
Lucy!

1244
01:25:45,477 --> 01:25:48,071
- Hi, I' m Tom.
- Hey, I met you before. I' m Henry.

1245
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:51,044
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Lucy Whitmore.

1246
01:25:51,216 --> 01:25:52,740
Any idea where I can find her?

1247
01:25:52,918 --> 01:25:54,146
Hi, I' m Tom.

1248
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:57,288
Oh. Thanks anyways.

1249
01:25:57,889 --> 01:25:59,754
Lucy!

1250
01:26:00,692 --> 01:26:02,182
Lucy!

1251
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:07,994
Lucy Whitmore...

1252
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:11,099
...can I ask you a question?

1253
01:26:14,172 --> 01:26:16,367
Do you have any idea who I am?

1254
01:26:22,447 --> 01:26:25,610
- No.
- No?

1255
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:29,177
That sucks.

1256
01:26:30,755 --> 01:26:33,747
- What's your name?
- I' m Henry.

1257
01:26:34,292 --> 01:26:36,055
Henry.

1258
01:26:37,395 --> 01:26:40,262
I want to show you something.
Will you come with me?

1259
01:26:40,532 --> 01:26:41,931
Well, yeah.

1260
01:26:43,768 --> 01:26:45,702
Hey. Do you know who that guy is?

1261
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,031
Dude, I don't even know who I am.

1262
01:26:48,206 --> 01:26:50,470
Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso.

1263
01:26:50,775 --> 01:26:54,472
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1264
01:26:57,749 --> 01:27:00,411
This is my studio.

1265
01:27:19,904 --> 01:27:22,566
I don't know who you are, Henry...

1266
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:28,045
...but I dream about you
almost every night.

1267
01:27:30,548 --> 01:27:32,072
Why?

1268
01:27:32,717 --> 01:27:36,778
What would you say if I told you
that notebook you read every day...

1269
01:27:37,255 --> 01:27:40,281
...used to have a lot of stuff
about me in it?

1270
01:27:41,559 --> 01:27:44,153
I would say that that
makes a lot of sense.

1271
01:27:44,796 --> 01:27:46,593
You erased me
from your memories...

1272
01:27:46,765 --> 01:27:49,928
...because you thought you were
holding me back from having...

1273
01:27:50,135 --> 01:27:51,864
...a full and happy life.

1274
01:27:52,337 --> 01:27:54,828
But you made a mistake.

1275
01:27:55,006 --> 01:27:58,635
Being with you is the only way
I could have a full and happy life.

1276
01:27:59,778 --> 01:28:02,042
You're the girl of my dreams...

1277
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:05,979
...and apparently I' m the man of yours.

1278
01:28:10,855 --> 01:28:12,618
Henry.

1279
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:14,190
It's nice to meet you.

1280
01:28:14,959 --> 01:28:17,951
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.

1281
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:24,301
Hi, I' m Tom.

1282
01:28:24,469 --> 01:28:26,630
Henry, Lucy. Nice to meet you, Tom.

1283
01:28:26,805 --> 01:28:30,434
Now why don't you come back in
ten seconds so we can meet again?

1284
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,315
Do you, Honah Lee, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

1285
01:29:19,491 --> 01:29:21,857
...to have and to hold
from this day forh...

1286
01:29:22,327 --> 01:29:24,420
...as long as you both shall live?

1287
01:29:24,596 --> 01:29:26,564
- I do.
- Really?

1288
01:29:26,764 --> 01:29:28,959
Even though in, like, 10, 15 years...

1289
01:29:29,134 --> 01:29:31,830
...she could possibly let herself
go and then, like...

1290
01:29:32,003 --> 01:29:34,369
...sex could be, like,
nauseating for you?

1291
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:37,235
What are you, nuts?
Your wife's right over there.

1292
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,039
I'm just kidding, Muumuu!

1293
01:29:41,346 --> 01:29:44,213
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1294
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,911
Mazel tov!

1295
01:29:53,024 --> 01:29:55,117
It's very cold, so when you're ready...

1296
01:29:55,293 --> 01:29:58,922
...put on a jacket and come have
breakfast with me. Love you.

1297
01:30:30,995 --> 01:30:36,092
Hey, hey! Good morning, Mrs. Roth.
Would you like to meet your daughter?

1298
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:37,663
Go say hello to Mommy.

1299
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:41,031
Hi, Mommy.

1300
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:45,532
That's right.

1301
01:30:46,744 --> 01:30:48,371
Good morning.

1302
01:30:50,315 --> 01:30:52,476
Oh, my goodness!

1303
01:30:53,184 --> 01:30:55,516
- Grandpa's here.
- Hi, Dad.
