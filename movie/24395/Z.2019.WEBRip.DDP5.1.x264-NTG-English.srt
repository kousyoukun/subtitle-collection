1
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,590
Beth:
Josh, come down and eat.

2
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,160
Fine.

3
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,470
Yo. Eat up, buddy.

4
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,480
-You do you're homework?
-Yep.

5
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,960
Of course he did.
He always does.

6
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
-Hey.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,660
Okay, keys.

8
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,880
Keys.
Where are my keys?

9
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,580
-Seriously?
-What?

10
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,490
-You're ridiculous.
-See -- yeah.

11
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,880
I was testing you.
-Hmm.

12
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,450
-That was a test.
-Hmm.

13
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,890
-You failed.
-Aw!

14
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,410
And you -- thank you.

15
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,590
Okay.

16
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,810
I'm out. Knuckles.
Pound it.

17
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,980
Boom. Nice.
Thank you.

18
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,030
-'Kay.
-Love you guys.

19
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,380
-Bye, Dad.
-Come on.

20
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,030
Hurry up.
They're gonna be here soon.

21
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,130
Hey.
Hey.

22
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,480
Hey, Daniel.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,830
Hey, Josh.

24
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,570
Looks like you
finally gave in.

25
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,870
Yeah. Well, it keeps him quiet
on the drive, at least.

26
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,700
So are we still on for
girls' night next week?

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,010
Anything to get away
from this little monster.

28
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,140
Right? All right, hey.

29
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,620
You guys be good
at school.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,060
-We know. Love you, Mom. Bye!
-All right, bye.

31
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,360
Good luck with that.
All right.  Bye.

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,950
Teacher: I saw some of you guys
were answering the questions

33
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,690
with numbers,
some had happy faces.

34
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,080
I like all the answers,

35
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,300
but how many muffins
are we gonna eat?

36
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,660
Okay, go ahead.

37
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,530
Hey. Sorry.

38
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,660
Shh.

39
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,710
Hear that?

40
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,930
Hold on.

41
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,150
Josh: What?

42
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,940
Here, uh,
you can move your guy.

43
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,810
Here.
I'll let you go first.

44
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,160
Okay.

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,550
Uh, then we set them
up in a line.

46
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,550
And you're like, four --
four, five, or six each.

47
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,470
Yeah, sure, but how many
do you want to put on first?

48
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,170
Six?
Yeah, sure. Here.

49
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,340
I'll have six, too.

50
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,870
I think Josh has
an imaginary friend.

51
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,650
Ah, that's cute.

52
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,270
I guess.

53
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,880
Okay, time for
your ni-nights.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,450
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

55
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,270
And goodnight, Matchie.

56
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,490
Mm. Anybody else?

57
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,930
Goodnight, Chewie!

58
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,410
Mm-hmm.

59
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,500
Okay, give me a kiss.

60
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,460
-Goodnight, Mom.
-Love you.

61
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,550
You want it open or shut?

62
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,460
-Open.
-Okay. Night.

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,080
Bye, Mom!
Bye, honey.

64
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,390
-Good morning.
-Seatbelts?

65
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,530
-Yep.
-Okay.

66
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,050
Thank you.

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,770
Shit.

68
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,950
Hey, Mom.

69
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,780
How you feeling?

70
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,620
Where's your sister?

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,490
Uh, yeah, she should
be here soon.

72
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,760
Can I get you anything?

73
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,900
I saw your father.

74
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,290
He looked just the same.

75
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,640
He hadn't aged a day.

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,170
I could smell his cologne.

77
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,030
Ah.

78
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,080
Is that for
your new friend?

79
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't think
we've formally met, Josh.

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What's your new friend's
name?

81
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,830
Are you gonna tell us?

82
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,840
He doesn't want me to.

83
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,190
-Oh.
-Okay.

84
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,010
Hmm.

85
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,110
They want to know your name.

86
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,110
Okay. Yeah.

87
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,330
Okay, sounds good.

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,270
"Z"?

89
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,310
Yep.

90
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,700
Nice to meet you, Z.

91
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,750
He says,
"Nice to meet you, too."

92
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, wow.

93
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,880
He's very polite.

94
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,590
Mom, no! The floor's hot lava!
Stop, stop, stop!

95
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,330
The floor is hot lava.

96
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,860
Only step on the rocks.

97
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,030
Yeah, okay, good.
Come on.

98
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,430
Let's go.
It's time for bed.

99
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,640
No, no! You're melting!
You're melting!

100
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,250
Aaaaah!

101
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,780
No! No!

102
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,910
Come on.
It's time to brush your teeth.

103
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,220
Let's go.

104
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,610
Come on, Z, let's go.

105
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,920
Okay.

106
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,050
Make one more move.
Just come on.

107
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,920
Oh! Oh. Whoa, whoa.
This floor is hot.

108
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,230
So, now -- ha!

109
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,320
You're stuck, Z!

110
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,880
Okay, Josh,
come on now.

111
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,540
Fine.

112
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,550
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

113
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,240
Good night, Matchie.

114
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,640
Good night, Chewie.

115
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,730
Mm, sweetie, you sure you still
want to say good night to him?

116
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,080
Just because he died
doesn't mean he can't hear me.

117
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,870
Okay.
All right.

118
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,610
Love you.Love you, too.

119
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,880
Wait.
Close it.

120
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,580
Are you sure?
Yeah.

121
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,360
Z likes it dark.

122
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,020
So, what are we gonna
do about this?

123
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,420
About what?

124
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,250
What do you think?

125
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,810
What, his creepy
imaginary friend?

126
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,950
I don't know.

127
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,470
He'll grow out of it,
I guess.

128
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,910
Yeah.

129
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,180
Yeah, probably.

130
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,930
Did Daniel say anything?

131
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,670
That they weren't gonna
come today?

132
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,370
Josh, did Daniel
say anything?

133
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,850
Beth: All right,
have a good day.

134
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,030
Love you.

135
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,060
Hello?

136
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,930
This is.

137
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,240
This is never
an easy conversation to have.

138
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,630
I just don't understand.
Suspended indefinitely?

139
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,590
Listen, Josh is one
of my favorite students.

140
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,900
Well, what did he do
exactly?

141
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,030
I don't even know
where to start.

142
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,690
Um, the language is
unacceptable,

143
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,990
and now he's started
hitting his classmates.

144
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,600
What? Hitting?

145
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,820
This was all detailed in the
red cards I sent home with him.

146
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,310
W-What red cards?

147
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,180
This is your husband's signature
isn't it?

148
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,490
Sorry, Beth.

149
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,400
Until Josh can behave
in a classroom setting,

150
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,710
I -- I just don't see
any other options.

151
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,280
"Josh left class
without permission

152
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,020
and refused to come back
when asked."

153
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,760
"Josh was caught harassing
other students,

154
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,070
both verbally
andphysically."

155
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,600
"Josh has been using
vulgar language repeatedly,

156
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,080
was asked to stop
but continued."

157
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,340
Sh-- shall I keep going?

158
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,120
Okay.
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,000
It's just, kids get
into trouble sometimes.

160
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,480
It's what they do.

161
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, our kid just got
suspended, Kevin,

162
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,310
so great job.

163
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,830
That's good parenting.

164
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,350
And he refuses to take
responsibility for any of it.

165
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,270
He blames all of it
on his new best friend.

166
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,530
Okay.
So what do you want to do?

167
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,590
Dr. Seager:
Having an imaginary friend

168
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,460
can come from
several things --

169
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,550
boredom, loneliness,
a need to establish boundaries,

170
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,640
and sometimes means
acting out.

171
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,080
So, does he need to be
on something?

172
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,690
Beth.

173
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,520
Jesus. Were not
medicating our kid.

174
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,090
No, I don't think
that's necessary.

175
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,610
A lot of children develop
imaginary friends,

176
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:58,270
and oftentimes it can be
a positive experience.

177
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,320
So, is there anything we can do
to help him be less...

178
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
you know, destructive?

179
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,190
Well, you could try playing
with him more at home.

180
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,240
You could be there for him
like his friend is,

181
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,460
help him see that
it's all right

182
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,680
to be himself
around real people.

183
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,290
Okay.

184
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,170
So, that's it?

185
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,860
I think so.

186
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,430
I think he's a perfectly normal
8-year-old boy.

187
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,920
Okay.

188
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,660
Nice to see you again,
Beth,

189
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,880
although I wish it was
under better circumstances.

190
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,620
-Oh. Yeah.
-Josh, let's go.

191
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,320
Come on, Z.

192
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,490
Z?

193
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,190
Yeah, that's what
he calls it.

194
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,020
Listen,
thanks for everything.Uh, yeah.

195
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,280
We'll follow up
in a couple days.

196
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,630
-Of course.
-Okay.

197
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,720
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

198
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,590
Okay. Hey, Josh.

199
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,470
You know, you really gotta
go see Mom.

200
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,380
She's --
she's looking rough.

201
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,040
She keeps asking
about you.

202
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,820
I know. I know.

203
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,300
It's just, I can't see her
like that.

204
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,480
It actually makes me
feel sorry for her.

205
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,570
I don't think
that's possible.

206
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,490
What has she been saying?

207
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,930
She talks about Dad a lot.

208
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,280
He's having fun.

209
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,590
Wish I had a friend
like that.

210
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,460
Ah, just make one up.
That's what he did.

211
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,070
Hm.

212
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:05,090
Kevin.

213
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,230
Josh?

214
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,500
Josh.
Hi, Mommy.

215
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,370
Z doesn't want crust
on his sandwich.

216
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,770
Okay, honey.

217
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,200
Can you just
give me that --
No!

218
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,950
I have to finish.
He's hungry.

219
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,900
Okay, why don't you
just give me the knife?

220
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,950
Careful now.
Good boy.

221
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,470
I'll tell you what -- we will
finish this in the morning.

222
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,220
Okay? Right now,
let's just go back to bed.

223
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
-Thanks.

224
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,190
Is this for me?

225
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,930
Ah.

226
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,200
So, what are you two
getting up to today?

227
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,120
-We're going to Play Zone!

228
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,770
Hey, you show your mom
a good time, little dude.

229
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,780
And you, remember --

230
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,780
just be the friend
he needs.

231
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,830
All right, I gotta run.
I love you guys.

232
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,130
Knuckles.
All right.

233
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,620
Yeah! Yeah!

234
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,410
Oh!

235
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm gonna get you!

236
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,150
-Whoo!

237
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,800
Ha, ha, ha!
I won!

238
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,330
You lo-o-o-o-ost!
Now, come on.

239
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,500
Let's go on the big slide.
Big slide, big slide.

240
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,940
-No. No.
-Yes!

241
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,250
-I don't like the big slide.
-Yes, yes!

242
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,030
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.No, I don't like it.

243
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,550
Oh.

244
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,380
Oh, my God.

245
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,180
Hey, Mom, look at me!

246
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,440
Come on.
Come play.

247
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,710
-Josh?
-Help me!

248
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,460
Josh!

249
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,410
Ah! Josh!

250
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,550
Okay, okay.
Josh!

251
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,810
Ha, ha, ha!

252
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,860
I got you! I got you!
I got you!

253
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,860
Oh, my God! You should have seen
the look on your face!

254
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,470
It was classic.

255
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,960
Mom!
Yeah.

256
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,180
Can you get me and Z
some milk?

257
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,350
Sure.

258
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,050
Oh, hey.
How was Play Zone?

259
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,010
It was awesome. Yeah?

260
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,150
But she was way too scared
to go on the big slide.

261
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,150
Every time.

262
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,410
Wait!
Grab the 2%.

263
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,330
Let me tell you a secret.

264
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,070
You tell her you're going
on the small slide.

265
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,070
You sneak around
to the big line-up.

266
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,900
She never has a clue.

267
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,290
Hey, you think Z
would mind

268
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,210
if I have a piece
of his garlic toast?

269
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,770
Thanks, Z!

270
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,690
Ugh.
Kevin, don't, please,

271
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,300
talk to it
like it's real.

272
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,660
Give me your glass.

273
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,660
Thank you.Here you go, bud.

274
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,290
Hey.
Hey.

275
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,770
What's on your mind?

276
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,990
Is it a certain letter,
perhaps the last one?

277
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,660
Something happened.

278
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,790
What do you mean?

279
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,710
So, Josh was playing
at Play Zone and, uh...

280
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,450
It was like for a second...

281
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,200
...I -- I saw --
I saw it.

282
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,860
I -- I saw Z.

283
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,870
God, I wasn't gonna
say anything.

284
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,390
But a couple nights ago
when I was heading up to bed,

285
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,610
I swear I saw something standing
in the corner watching me.

286
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,270
You know, at first
I second-guessed it.

287
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,880
I -- I closed my eyes,

288
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,620
and I told myself
it wasn't there.

289
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,370
But it was, Beth.

290
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,930
Something was there.

291
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,550
Really?

292
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,940
No, it was my jacket.

293
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,770
Z isn't real.

294
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,990
Grow up.

295
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,300
Thanks.

296
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,610
Look, it's our kid's
imaginary friend.

297
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,390
Oh, Jesus Christ.

298
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,360
Josh: Cheer up.
Okay.

299
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,190
Uh, I like baseball.

300
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,540
Mm-hmm.
Mostly center field.

301
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,370
Oh, yeah,
that's for sure.

302
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,110
Ah, there's a crazy tiger!

303
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,770
Yeah, or is this a leopard
or cheetah?

304
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,900
What does
she look like?

305
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,340
Eh, the same,
just deader.

306
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,560
Oh, shit.

307
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,130
You should go up there.

308
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,960
Dead bodies
freak me out.

309
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,490
Yeah.

310
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,620
She's our mom.

311
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,060
Yeah.

312
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,870
Mechanical voice: Z.

313
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,320
Z.

314
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,590
Z.

315
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,350
Z.

316
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,660
Z.

317
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,810
Hmm.
Hey.

318
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,860
I couldn't do it.
Let's go.

319
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,260
Hey, Anne, it's Beth,
Josh's mom.

320
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,180
Yeah, hey, listen,
I -- I just was wondering

321
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,570
if maybe Josh could have a play
date with Thomas this afternoon?

322
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,970
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

323
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,970
No, we can -- we can
just do it another time.

324
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,450
All right, thanks.

325
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,230
Hey, yeah.
I -- I just --

326
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,500
I haven't seen you guys since --
since Brittany's birthday,

327
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,760
and, uh, I just thought
maybe Josh could come over

328
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,150
and have a play date with her.

329
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,200
Hi. It's Josh's mom.
Listen, I was --

330
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,900
Wow.

331
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,340
Hello?

332
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,480
Georgia:
So, how is everything?

333
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,700
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

334
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm sure you heard
Josh got suspended.

335
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,180
Where's Daniel?

336
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,100
Uh, he's upstairs,

337
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,190
but I think he might be
taking a nap, and --

338
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,240
It's like my son's
one of those children

339
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,280
of the cornfield
or whatever.

340
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,020
Of course not.

341
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,510
I'm sorry about...
you know.

342
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,680
Ghosting me?

343
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,250
Yeah, that.

344
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,340
He's a good kid,
you know?

345
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,690
He's just got a really --
I don't know,

346
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,000
a vivid imagination
right now.

347
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,830
It wasn't just my choice.

348
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,310
Daniel was
really freaked out.

349
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,660
He said Josh was talking
about hurting animals.

350
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,530
What? No.
He would never do that.

351
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,320
All I know is that Daniel
was coming home crying,

352
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,670
and I need to
protect my son.

353
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,280
-Daniel!

354
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,370
-Aaaaah!
-Oh, my God.

355
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,280
Oh, my God!

356
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,420
-Oh, my God, Daniel!

357
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,200
Georgia: Call 911!

358
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,070
Daniel! Daniel!

359
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,900
Ah!

360
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,010
I am so sorry.

361
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,530
I don't even know
what to say.

362
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,060
Just stop it!
Just go away!

363
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,930
I never want to
see you again!

364
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,800
It's okay, baby.
Mommy's right here.

365
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,280
Oh, hi, Mommy.

366
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,760
Wanna play?

367
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,330
Hi, baby.

368
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,810
Yeah, you just -- you let us
know if you need anything.

369
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,120
Okay, yeah, and --
and we're s--

370
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,430
I -- all right, bye.

371
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,180
Jesus.

372
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,570
How is he?

373
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,010
I don't even know
where to start.

374
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,620
It's not good.

375
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,590
What do we do?

376
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,900
Josh!

377
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,070
Honey, come and eat!

378
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,210
Josh.

379
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,120
I've been downstairs
calling you.

380
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,430
Josh.

381
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,220
Joshua,
I am speaking to y--

382
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,830
Do you like it?
It's Z.

383
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,440
Um...

384
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,230
I would like you to come down
for lunch, please.

385
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,660
Okay.

386
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,190
Come on. Eat up.

387
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,110
I'm not hungry.

388
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,980
Well, if you're not gonna eat,
at least drink your milk.

389
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,120
Make you big and strong,
just like Z.

390
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,820
Z says I shouldn't.

391
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,260
Really?

392
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,610
Okay, here we go.

393
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,260
I'm gonna drink some.

394
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,570
See?

395
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,590
It's good, huh?

396
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,260
Want some carrots?

397
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,310
Why don't we just hire
some movers to do this?

398
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,880
I don't know.
You want to pay for it?

399
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,840
Good point.

400
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,320
Hey, what's up
with Josh today?

401
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,410
Uh, I don't know.
I guess he's --

402
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,110
he's just a little off.

403
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,890
♪ New friends
along the way♪

404
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,680
♪ We love to sing
and we love to play♪

405
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,130
Oh, no way!

406
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,820
Nice.

407
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,570
Oh, my God.
Wow.

408
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,830
Oh. Oh, wow.

409
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,790
Here, let's get
a shot of that.

410
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,970
For when you find
your Princess Charming.

411
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,140
Oh, yeah, right.Could happen.

412
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,540
I should just douse this place
in gasoline.

413
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,670
I'm sure insurance would have
to be worth something.

414
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,240
Like 10 bucks.

415
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,110
Seriously.
God.

416
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,120
Whoa.

417
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,510
She kept
allof this stuff?

418
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,900
Yeah, tucked away
in her basement

419
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,170
along with all the rest
of her forgotten shit.

420
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,690
You were cute, though.
Mm.

421
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,040
What happened to you?

422
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,650
Mm.

423
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,660
What did you inherit
when your mother died?

424
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,360
Oh, a giant bag of badges
from the 1970s.

425
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,980
Josh?

426
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,930
Josh?

427
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,750
Hey, you shouldn't be
in this room.

428
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,360
Come on.
We're all done packing.

429
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,500
Josh.

430
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,070
Hey, come on.

431
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,720
What's going on
with you?

432
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,290
I don't want you coming
in this room anymore.

433
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,780
Man: Come on, Jenna.
Yeah!

434
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,350
-Oh, that's --

435
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,790
♪ To you♪
Ahhh!

436
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,090
You want
to blow this out?

437
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,570
-No, I'll wait.
-Where's Beth?

438
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,400
-She's up there?

439
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,060
Elizabeth.

440
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,410
Beth,
what are you doing?

441
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,370
Let's go.

442
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,410
Beth!
Okay.

443
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,290
Come on, Z.

444
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,810
Ooh!

445
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,680
There you go!

446
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,210
Come on, Z.

447
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,350
Let's go.

448
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,910
Beth!

449
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,400
Come on, Z.

450
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,320
Come on, Z.

451
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh, this is going to
take a few coats.

452
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,410
Shit is dark.

453
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,240
At least he's not playing
with this thing anymore.

454
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,420
Yeah.

455
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,950
Josh, come and eat!

456
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,700
Hey.

457
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,840
You okay?

458
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,880
I don't feel good.

459
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Oh.

460
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,150
Ah, you know what?
Don't -- don't drink that.

461
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,630
Here.

462
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,280
Oh, baby,
you're burning up.

463
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,160
Kevin, can you bring me
the thermometer please?

464
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,250
Josh?

465
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,940
Are you okay?

466
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,080
Oh!

467
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,950
You know what?
That's it, that's it.

468
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,300
Get it out.

469
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,870
Josh:

470
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,090
It's okay, buddy,
get it out.

471
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,920
You're all right.

472
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,220
Well, do you know when he'll be
out of his appointment?

473
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,830
Well, he wrote my kid
a prescription,

474
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,570
and now he's having a reaction.

475
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,710
He's vomiting.

476
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,100
Well, I -- I don't know.

477
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,190
Do we put him on
something different?

478
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,330
You put our son on medication
and didn't tell me?

479
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,680
You're not here, Kevin.

480
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,980
You're not seeing
what I'm seeing.

481
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,200
You don't understand
how bad it is.

482
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,680
He threw a kid
off a fucking balcony.

483
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,510
You don't know that,
Beth!

484
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,770
He said he didn't do it.

485
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,730
Bullshit!Give me the pills.

486
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,690
No.
Give me the pills.

487
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,470
Kevin. Don't.
No! Ugh!

488
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,480
Like you don't keep things
from me, Kevin?

489
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,830
How about the red card?
Huh? How about those?

490
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,570
You don't think it would be nice
to know about those

491
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,920
before everybody
in the school

492
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,220
decided that we were
terrible parents?

493
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,610
Thisis not about us!

494
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,440
This is about him.

495
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,580
They were helping, Kevin.

496
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:18,630
Beth: ♪ Sleepy time
Sleepy time ♪

497
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:24,810
♪ Now it is
your sleepy time ♪

498
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:29,340
♪ And go to sleep ♪

499
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,730
Mechanical voice: Z.

500
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,610
Z.

501
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,020
Z.

502
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,020
Z.

503
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,900
Z.

504
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,210
Beth.

505
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,960
Z.

506
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,400
Z.

507
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,190
Z.

508
00:41:37,410 --> 00:42:07,090
I, M, A, G, I, N, E, Z.

509
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,350
"Imagine Z."

510
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,740
"Imagine Z."

511
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,570
"Imagine Z."

512
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,530
"Imagine Z."

513
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,180
"Imagine Z."

514
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,450
"Imagine Z."

515
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,080
"Imagine Z."

516
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,270
Beth!

517
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,540
It's okay.

518
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,750
I --

519
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,800
What happened, Beth?

520
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,150
What happened in there?

521
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,240
Z is real Kevin.

522
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,590
He -- he's re-- real.

523
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,250
Beth, what you're saying,
its --

524
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,990
I know.
I know how it sounds.

525
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,780
You just --
you have to trust me.

526
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,210
He -- he was
my friend, too.

527
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,700
Okay. Okay.

528
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,360
Okay.

529
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,080
Jenna.

530
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,480
Beth, I --

531
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,870
Jesus. What are --
what are you doing here?

532
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,530
Are you okay?

533
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,180
Are you all right?

534
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,800
I didn't...
get to see her.

535
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,720
I just, uh --

536
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,810
I, uh -- I messed up.

537
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,240
No.
No, you didn't.

538
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,720
It's okay.

539
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,980
Mm.

540
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,550
It's okay.

541
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,120
Okay, no, no.
Okay.

542
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,650
Mm.

543
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,960
Come on. It's okay.

544
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,310
We'll sort it out.

545
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,310
She's our mom.

546
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:32,960
She's all we had.

547
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,490
We still have each other,
huh?

548
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,450
Ah. I --

549
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:45,150
I just need to --
to lie down.

550
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,280
I just need to
lie down.
Okay.

551
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,420
Ah.

552
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,560
It's time
for your ni-nights.

553
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,170
I don't want to do 'em.

554
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,610
Why not?

555
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,180
I don't feel like it.

556
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,620
Honey, what's wrong?

557
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,230
You saw Z, didn't you?

558
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,190
What do you mean?

559
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,630
He saw you, too.

560
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,030
Hello? Dr. Seager?

561
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,470
Um, I'm sorry to call so late.
It -- it's Beth.

562
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:49,040
Dr. Seager:
No, no, it's fine.

563
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,430
Is everything all right?

564
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,780
I ju-- actually,
just was wondering

565
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,260
if maybe I could schedule,
um, an appointment?

566
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,260
Is everything's okay
with Josh?

567
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,530
Um, it's not for Josh.

568
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,890
Mm. It's for me.

569
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,410
It's happening again,
isn't it?

570
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,110
Same thing that happened
when you were a child.

571
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:32,120
When I heard your son
say the name Z,

572
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,690
I realized
I'd heard it before.

573
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,880
What is this?

574
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,710
You were a patient
of mine, Beth.

575
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,970
Your father brought you to me
when you were Josh's age.

576
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,890
He begged me to help you.

577
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,590
He was terrified.

578
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,460
Your friend was unlike anything
I'd ever encountered.

579
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,860
He was...dangerous,

580
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:16,250
destructive, obsessive.

581
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,300
Of course, when he stopped
bringing you in,

582
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,260
I -- I thought
you'd outgrown it.

583
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,140
I had no idea
what had transpired.

584
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,710
I want to
show you something.

585
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,320
Dr. Seager:
Hello, Elizabeth.

586
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,500
Hi.

587
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,370
Hello, Z.

588
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:51,420
So, Beth, your dad told me that
you didn't love him anymore.

589
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,680
Why would you say
such a thing?

590
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,030
Because it's true.

591
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:59,730
Your dad said that you're
refusing to go to school.

592
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,870
Z says I don't need school.
He says he'll take care of me.

593
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,260
What happens
when you outgrow Z?

594
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,480
Every child outgrows their
imaginary friend, you know.

595
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,180
Z says when I'm older,
he'll find me,

596
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,230
and we'll get married,
and we'll have lots of babies.

597
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,100
It's been waiting
for you, Beth,

598
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,320
and I think
it's using your son

599
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,630
to try to reconnect
with you.

600
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,850
But it wants only you.

601
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,420
Oh, come on, come on.
Just pick up, please.

602
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,290
Hey, this is Kevin Parsons
I'm not avai--

603
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,030
Oh, shit.

604
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,700
Kevin, please.

605
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,260
Please pick up.

606
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,880
Hey, this is Kevin Parsons
I'm not available...

607
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,840
Agh! ...to take your call
right now.

608
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,340
Hi, buddy.
I love you.

609
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:20,960
Come on.

610
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,050
Get out of the way!

611
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:45,730
Oh, Josh.

612
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,290
Mechanical voice: Z.

613
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,870
Z.

614
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,910
Z.

615
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,880
Z.

616
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:19,120
Kevin!

617
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,130
Josh!

618
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,570
Kevin.

619
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,750
Mommy!

620
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,750
I'm scared!

621
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,060
Josh!

622
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,670
Josh!

623
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,720
Aah!

624
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,200
Josh!
Let him out, please!

625
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,590
Ah! Ah! Ah!

626
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,730
Please!
I'll be yours.

627
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:06,910
Please don't take my baby.

628
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:10,040
Z, I'll be yours, okay?
Please.

629
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,390
Please just let him out.
Please.

630
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,480
Ah! Ah!

631
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,660
Ah! Josh!

632
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,100
-Mommy?
-Josh!

633
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,710
-Mommy.
-It's okay.

634
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,800
Okay.

635
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,760
Okay, baby.

636
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,630
Mommy.

637
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,150
You don't want me to be taking
care of Josh right now, Beth,

638
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,320
trust me.I don't have any choice.

639
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,720
You're all I have left.

640
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,860
He's not safe with me.

641
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,730
He won't be safe
with me, either.

642
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,300
It's not forever, okay?

643
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,080
It's just until
I figure some things out.

644
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,430
Take this,

645
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,430
and you
clean yourself up.

646
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:41,660
If not for me,
then for him.

647
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,480
Okay?

648
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,000
All right.

649
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,390
Just...

650
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,790
imagine Z.

651
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,620
Imagine Z.

652
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,010
Imagine Z.

653
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,490
Imagine Z.

654
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:32,640
Imagine Z.

655
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,600
Imagine Z.

656
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:59,190
Three...two...

657
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,060
one.

658
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,970
One...

659
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,240
two...

660
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,370
three.

661
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,890
Ready or not,

662
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,420
I'll find you, Z.

663
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,590
I'm gonna find you.

664
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,860
I found you.

665
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:45,000
I forgot 2%.

666
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,480
I'm sorry.
I forgot...

667
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,090
I know.

668
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,630
2%.

669
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,990
Dr. Seager: Beth?
I know you're in there.

670
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,260
I spoke to your sister.

671
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,260
She told me
what happened.

672
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,310
Dr. Seager.

673
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:18,490
Are you okay?

674
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:21,490
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

675
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:25,020
I heard about Kevin.
I'm so sorry.

676
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,370
Is someone in here
with you?

677
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:33,940
No.

678
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,510
Can I come in?

679
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,950
I don't -- I don't think that
that would be a good idea.

680
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,380
Please.

681
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,390
Beth...

682
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,430
I think I can help you.

683
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,140
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

684
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,750
Is Josh here?

685
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:11,850
Uh, no,
he's at my sister's.

686
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,000
Uh, maybe we could...
sit in the living room.

687
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:39,090
He's here with you,
isn't he, Beth?

688
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,050
I don't know what
you're talking about.

689
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,010
Is this what you want?

690
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,060
To be with him?

691
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,590
I -- I think
you should go, please.

692
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,120
Please.

693
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,990
Listen to me.

694
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,470
You created this thing.

695
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,210
It's all in your head.

696
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,390
This is not real.

697
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,620
This is not real.

698
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,680
No!

699
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,510
Stop, please.

700
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:38,380
Please stop!

701
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,340
Please! Stop!

702
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,740
I'll be right out.

703
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,180
Okay?

704
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,700
I'll be right out.

705
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,070
What do you want for breakfast?

706
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,780
Z, I can't find you.

707
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,440
Do we have to
play this game tonight?

708
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,310
It's so late.

709
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,490
Ah! Ah.

710
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,620
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

711
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:33,630
The floor...is lava!

712
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:37,810
And you can't step
in the lava...

713
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:40,510
or else you'll get burnt.

714
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,160
Come on, Z.

715
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,300
Ha!
You're stuck, Z!

716
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,360
-Hello?
-Jenna.

717
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,930
Jenna:
Beth? Oh, my God.

718
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,540
Why aren't you
answering your texts?

719
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,720
I know. Listen, I don't have
a lot of time to talk, okay?

720
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,630
I'm on my way up!
I can find you.

721
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:21,290
Can you put Josh on the line
for me, please?

722
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:23,600
Josh: Mom?

723
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,640
Hey! Hi, Josh.
How are you, baby?

724
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,210
I miss you.

725
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,080
Listen, I'm gonna see you
really soon, okay?

726
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,090
You tell Aunty Jenna
that I will call her

727
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,740
as soon as I can.

728
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,570
You stole my friend!

729
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:40,700
Josh?

730
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,680
Oh, shit.

731
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:07,550
Z?

732
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,580
Hello?
Beth: Jenna.

733
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,350
I need you to get Josh
out of there right now, please.

734
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:32,290
-Whoa. Slow down. -Are you with him
right now? Do you see him? -Yeah, he's fine.

735
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:33,690
I'm looking right at him
right now.

736
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,330
Okay, listen, I want you
to put him in the car
and just get as far away
as you can.

737
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,200
We're fine.

738
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,890
It's just, how much longer do
you need me to keep him for?

739
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,290
Ugh! You're not
listening to me. Please!

740
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:45,040
I want you to just get Josh
out of there right now.

741
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:47,210
It's not safe.He's fine, Beth,
I promise.

742
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:53,120
Josh?

743
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,820
What you mean he's gone?
You said he was right there.

744
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:57,300
Beth, I know.
Just -- Josh?

745
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,910
Just give me a second.

746
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,130
What do you mean
give you a second?

747
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,740
Where is he?Josh.

748
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,090
Oh, shit.

749
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:07,570
Answer me.
Where is Josh?

750
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:08,790
I have no idea.

751
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,310
He was just
sitting right there,

752
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:12,360
and he just disappeared.
Just give me a second.

753
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,710
Please, I need you to
tell me you see him.

754
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:17,620
Oh! Where is he?

755
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,890
Josh!

756
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,840
Jenna, please talk to me!

757
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,630
Where is my son?!

758
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,600
Ma'am, open the door.

759
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,080
We're here
to help you, Beth.

760
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,040
Jenna?

761
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,260
Jenna, are you there,
please?

762
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,350
Josh!

763
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,790
Jenna, please tell me
you're there.

764
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,180
I'm looking, okay?
Just give me a second.

765
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,840
Jenna, please.

766
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,800
Come on, Z.
Choo-choo-choo!

767
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:04,410
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-
chugga-chugga-chugga...

768
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,810
Choo-choo!

769
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:13,030
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-
chugga-chugga-chugga...

770
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,940
Choo-choo!

771
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,600
Chugga-chugga-
chugga-chugga-choo.

772
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,550
Josh!

773
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,210
Josh!

774
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:28,170
Chugga-chugga-chugga
choo-choo!

775
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,960
Chugga-chugga-
chugga-chugga...

776
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,270
Josh!

777
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:37,180
Jenna, tell me
you have him, please.

778
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,880
Is Z in there with you,
Beth?

779
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,020
He has my son!

780
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,370
Remember...

781
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:50,240
this is all
in your mind, Beth.

782
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,850
No, I don't know.

783
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,760
This thing -- you got to get it
out of your head.

784
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,160
You created it.
Only you can stop it.

785
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,040
Only you can stop it.

786
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,820
I can stop it.

787
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,790
Josh!

788
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,520
Jenna: I got him.

789
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,520
I got him, Beth.
He's okay.

790
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,530
Oh, Josh is okay.

791
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:46,090
He's okay.

792
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:47,700
Josh: Mommy?

793
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:27,000
All right.

794
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,610
Here we go.

795
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,450
Good.

796
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,030
Jenna: Okay, Josh.

797
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:53,600
Try to get some sleep.

798
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:03,170
Can I do
the ni-nights?

799
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,520
Not tonight.

800
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,780
We'll do them
tomorrow.

801
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:35,510
Josh: Good night, Mom.

802
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,730
Good night, Dad.

803
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,910
Good night, Aunty Jenna.

804
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,470
Good night, Matchie.

805
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:50,910
Goodnight, <font color="#ff0000">Z</font>.
