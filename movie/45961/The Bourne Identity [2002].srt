MEDITERRANEAN SEA
60 MILES SOUTH OF MARSEILLES

3
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:43,383
THE BOURNE IDENTITY

4
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,392
What a mess.

5
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:59,197
You've never seen a dead man before?

6
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,272
Put a blanket on him. Cover him.

7
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:10,741
I'm coming.

8
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:12,778
Be careful.

9
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:15,304
One minute. I'll be right there. Cover him.

Gemeinschaft Bank Zurich

11
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,367
What the hell
are you doing to me?

12
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:00,208
What are you doing?

13
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,604
Goddamn it! Where am I?

14
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:06,275
A boat! A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

15
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,717
We pulled you out.

16
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,119
What water?

17
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:11,713
You were shot. See?
There are the bullets.

18
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,491
Look, there is a number
for a bank. Why was it in your hip?

19
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:18,898
My hip?

20
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,628
- Why was it in your hip?
- My hip.

21
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,429
Yeah, in your hip under the skin.

22
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:23,933
Oh, God.

23
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,971
What are you doing with me?
You need to rest.

24
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:28,768
Please. Lie down.

25
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,906
I'm a friend. I'm your friend.

26
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,013
My name is Giancarlo.

27
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,048
Who are you?

28
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:39,912
What's your name?

29
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:42,181
What's your name?

30
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,023
I don't know.

31
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,756
Oh, God.
Lie down.

32
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,090
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

33
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,954
It's been confirmed, sir. Mission failed.

34
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,233
Do you know who I am?

35
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,899
I do not know who I am.

36
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,247
Tell me who I am.

37
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:19,912
If you know who I am...

38
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:23,320
Please stop messing around...

39
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,615
...and tell me.

40
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,404
If you want to eat, get in there.

41
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:43,439
Based on these charts,
I think I may have been closer to the coast.

42
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,274
What is this? You tie these knots?

43
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:49,878
So, it starts to come back?
No, it doesn't.

44
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,919
The knot's like everything else.
I found the rope and I did it.

45
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,515
Same way I can read.

46
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:57,316
I can write. I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee.

47
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,121
I can shuffle cards, play chess.
Yes, it will come back.

48
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:04,493
No, it's not coming back, goddamn it!
That's the point!

49
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,464
I'm down here looking through this,
all this shit!

50
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,701
For two weeks I'm down here.

51
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,897
It's not working.
I don't even know what to look for.

52
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:19,809
You need to rest. It will come back.

53
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,475
What if it doesn't come back?

54
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,216
We get in there tomorrow,
I don't even have a name.

55
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:02,748
It's not much,
but it should get you to Switzerland.

56
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,891
Thank you.

57
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,827
Can't you read the signs?

58
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,887
On your feet...Let’s go...right now.

59
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:55,493
The park is closed.
There's no sleeping in the park.

60
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,192
All right.

61
00:10:57,604 --> 00:10:59,469
Let's see some identification.

62
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,400
No, I don't-

63
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,907
Come on...your papers.

64
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,876
I don't have any papers. I lost my...

65
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,003
I've lost them...my papers...they are lost.

66
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,175
Ok...Let’s go...put your hands up.

67
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:15,147
...I just need to sleep...

68
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:41,539
These people have threatened my family.
My babies.

69
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:44,148
So I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear...

70
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:46,811
...I will have a nice story
for you to read about.

71
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:50,083
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

72
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,883
If you want to play this game...

73
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:55,322
...after I have been reasonable,
I will show you.

74
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:59,396
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris
the day before yesterday.

75
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,093
He was an irritation before he took power,
a problem...

76
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,930
...when he was in power,
and he's been a disaster for us in exile.

77
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,564
He's writing a book
about the Agency's history in Africa.

78
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:10,108
He's going to name names.

79
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,373
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the Agency's help.

80
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:17,244
He wants us to put him back in power
in six months, or else.

81
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,786
This interview, and I'll make the tape
available to whoever wants it...

82
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:24,550
...he goes on to claim that he's just
survived an assassination attempt.

83
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:28,056
He says it's us. He says he's got proof.

84
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,756
The Director wants to know
if there's any truth...

85
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,760
...in this accusation.

86
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,964
I've already assured him there's nobody
that reckless on my senior staff.

87
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:48,106
I was recalling a conversation
we had some time ago.

88
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,808
Talking about Treadstone.

89
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:53,817
I seem to remember Wombosi's name
might have come up.

90
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,986
I'm not sure what we're talking about.

91
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,785
Someone tried to take him out.

92
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,817
Tried and failed.

93
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,559
Was this Treadstone?

94
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,891
You're asking me a direct question?

95
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,593
Yes.

96
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,238
I thought you were never gonna do that.

97
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:13,636
What happened?

98
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:20,173
Well, we lost the communication
with our man.

99
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:22,111
This was almost two weeks ago.

100
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:24,672
We've worked around the clock.

101
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:28,083
We've been sleeping down there.
We're doing everything we can.

102
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:32,250
And you don't let me know this?
You never wanted to before.

103
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,426
You never made a mistake before.

104
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:46,496
GEMEINSCHAFT BANK
ZURICH SWITZERLAND

105
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,854
What can I do for you?

106
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:11,991
Yes, I'm here about a numbered account.

107
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:17,169
If you just enter your account number here,
I'll direct you to an appropriate officer.

108

00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,292
My name is Jason Bourne.

110
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,965
I live in Paris.

111
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:04,254
I'm trying to think...

112
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,696
How long it's been since I was here last?

113
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,199
I'm not sure.

114
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:10,627
It must be three weeks.

115
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,584
Yes, in Paris.

116
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,653
Do you have the number
for a Jason Bourne?

117
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:33,221
Yes. Would you like me to connect you?

118
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,892
Yes, please.

119
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:42,562
This is 46990384.

120
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:44,903
Leave a message at the beep.

121

U.S. Citizens

122
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,329
I'm an American.

123
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:52,496
Okay.

124
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,400
Hold it.

125
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,304
You've no jurisdiction here.

126
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,172
Hold it there. Okay?

127
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:04,173
No.

128
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,877
Excuse me. No.
This is not my current address, okay?

129
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:10,547
This was my address until two days ago,
when I started standing in line.

130
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,085
Now I lose my apartment, okay?

131
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:16,092
That means no address, no phone,
no money, no time.

132
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,561
- And I still have no visa!
- Miss Kreutz, please.

133
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,689
I must ask you
to keep your voice down.

134
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,031
Excuse me. But where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

135
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:26,594
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to-

136
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,401
I don't know who you saw last week.

137
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:31,169
Let me help you. I'm sure I have it.
Hang on.

138
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:33,370
Could I have your attention for a moment?

139
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:35,573
I have it right here. Just look at it.

140
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:40,014
You staged an effort to circumvent
the immigration laws of the United States.

141
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,110
This is a student visa now.

142
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:45,021
It's not about a green card anymore.
It's very different.

143
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:49,259
It's not a menu. You don't just...
I brought all this proof.

144
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:50,793
Potential suspect...

145
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,161
Help in assault incident.

146
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,931
You! Red bag! The red bag!

147
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,940
Stop right there! Put your hands up!

148
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:42,536
I'm on it.

149
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,485
Move it! Now!
Now! Move!

150
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:58,026
Alpha Unit, take the back stairs
and work your way up. Bravo-

00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:07,834
Move in! Move in!

153
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:11,670
Okay, clear!

154
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,037
Suspect is-

155
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:16,377
Moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.

156
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,312
Alpha Unit, you're clear.

157
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:32,196
Move! Move!

158
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,424
All Units, target may have a radio.

159
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:38,560
Go to Code 77. Over.

00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:40,762
Code 77, copy.

161
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:42,373
The floor! Down!

162
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,541
Clear!

163
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,109
DANGER - DO NOT OPEN

164
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,188
DO NOT ENTER

165
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:11,862
Go. Move up.

166
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,127
He's in Zurich now? Right now?
Yes. It just came in.

167
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,636
- They're sure it's him?
- Yes. He went to the bank.

168
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:26,603
Our source at the bank, that's who called.

169
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:27,605
Come on.

170
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:30,040
But he's got to assume
we're watching the bank, right?

171
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,236
I don't know. Come on.

172
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:35,438
I mean, he cleaned out the box.
He left a gun. What does that mean?

173
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:37,542
I said I don't know!

174
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:40,016
I liked it better when
I thought he was dead.

175
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,359
What are you looking at?

176
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,194
I heard you inside.

177
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,239
What?

178
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,937
The consulate. I heard you talking.
I thought maybe we could help each other.

179
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,068
How's that?

180
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:08,903
You need money. I need a ride out of here.

181
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,049
I'm not running a car service. Thank you.

182
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:15,245
I'll give you $10,000 to drive me to Paris.

183
00:26:16,422 --> 00:26:18,253
What, do you think I'm a fool?

184
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,415
You'd be a fool not to take it.

185
00:26:23,162 --> 00:26:27,155
Is this a joke? Some kind of scam?
No, it's no scam.

186
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,325
I'll give you another $10,000
when we arrive.

187
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,130
Jesus.

188
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,105
- Is that for you?
- Look. You drive, I pay. It's that simple.

189
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:48,779
I got enough trouble, okay?

190
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,321
Okay.

191
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:52,346
Can I have my money back?

192
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,865
All right, go. Keep going.

193
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:11,609
Go.

194
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:14,677
- There! Wait!
- No, it's got to be near the end.

195
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,772
Come on, folks! We caught a break here!
Let's go!

196
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,976
Okay, I'm up.

197
00:27:19,118 --> 00:27:22,110
We're getting grids.
Airline, train, hotels, hospitals.

198
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:24,678
- Who's getting the address? The street?
- Gemensheidt.

199
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,951
Here we go.
I think I got it.

200
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,356
Is it him?

201
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:29,889
Unreal.

202
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,620
This is 38 minutes ago.

203

Zurich police are looking
for an American carrying a red bank bag.

204
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:39,335
He just tore up the embassy and
put two cops in the hospital last night.

205
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:45,002
Get everybody up. Do it now.
I want them all activated.

206
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,907
Wait. All of them? At the same time?

207
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:50,641
You heard me.
I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown.

208
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:54,584
All right, let's get a map up here!
Come on, folks! Let's work it!

...which was fine with me
because I was ready.

230
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:22,599
After six months in Amsterdam,
you're not sure...

231
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:25,802
...if you've been there 20 minutes or years,
you know.

232
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:29,041
So I went. I took all the money I had.
I went in with friends...

233
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:33,751
...we took over this really cool surf shop
outside Biarritz, right by the water.

234
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,576
It was amazing.

235
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:40,117
It was just amazing for about three months,
until it turned out that this...

236
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:44,754
...jerk who had fronted us the lease
was actually shining everyone on and...

237
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:52,698
And what?

238
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:56,474
What do you mean ''what''? Listen to me.

239
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,135
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometers now.

240
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:02,476
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this when I'm nervous.

241
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:04,981
- I'm gonna shut up now.
- No, don't do that.

242
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:09,115
I haven't talked to anybody in a while.

243
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:12,784
Yeah, but we're not talking. I'm talking.

244
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,791
You've said,
like, 10 words since we left Zurich.

245
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,523
Well, listening to you, it's relaxing.

246
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:23,501
I haven't slept in a while and...

247
00:30:24,303 --> 00:30:26,134
And I've had this headache.

248
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:28,530
It's like a constant thing in my head...

249
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:32,006
...and it's just starting
to move to the background...

250
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:33,567
...so keep going.

251
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:37,211
Really, if you want, please keep talking.

252
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,211
Okay.

253
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:45,017
What kind of music do you like?

254
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,053
What do you like? Come on.

255
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:53,759
- You know what? Never mind.
- No, it's fine. Tell me.

256
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:55,560
What do you want to listen to?

257
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:57,724
I don't know.

258
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:01,967
Come on, it's not that hard.
What do you like? Tell me.

259
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,041
I don't know.

260
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:16,716
Who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?

261
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:28,060
Fuck it.

262
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:32,494
I can't remember anything
that happened before two weeks ago.

263
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,670
- Lucky you.
- No, I'm serious.

264
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:39,736
I don't know who I am.
I don't know where I'm going.

265
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:41,411
None of it.

266
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,506
What? Like amnesia?
Yes.

267
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,449
Amnesia.
Yes.

268
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:53,685
Right.

269
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,291
- And that's the best angle
of the courtyard? - That's the only angle.

270
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:07,763
What do they have of the streets?
Or, you know, the area?

271
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,101
They must have something.

272
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:10,436
Hang on.

273
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,110
What is he doing?

274
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:19,180
Is it a game? Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

275
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:21,853
Sir? Look at this.

276
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:26,488
- What's that? - It's an angle
of the street, a sort of alley.

277
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:28,352
Just enhance it.

278
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,528
Now, who the hell is that?

279
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:39,034
Marie Helena Kreutz.

280
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:42,701
She's 26, born outside Hanover.
Her father was a welder.

281
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:44,298
He died in '87.

282
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:47,834
We still don't have the mother.
The grandmother, she's still in Hanover.

283
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:51,705
It looks like she's the anchor
for this little domestic disaster.

284
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:53,375
And there's a stepbrother.

285
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,510
It's tough. The girl's a gypsy.

286
00:32:55,587 --> 00:33:00,149
I mean, she pops up on the grid
here and there, but it's chaotic at best.

287
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:02,692
She paid some electric bills in Spain, '95.

288
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:05,821
Had a phone in her name
for three months in Belgium, '96.

289
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:08,390
No taxes, no credit.

290
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,428
I don't like her. I want to go deep.

291
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,068
Get a phone log for Granny
and the half-brother.

292
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,198
Anybody we can cross-file.

293
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,538
I want to know every place she's slept
in the past six years.

294
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,342
Have Paris get these out in the field.

296
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:54,144
I'm not making this up.

297
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,071
These are real.

298
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:05,214
Okay.

299
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,054
Who has a safety deposit box full of...

300
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,656
...money and six passports and a gun?

301
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:18,168
Who has a bank account number
in their hip?

302
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:23,736
I come in here, and the first thing I'm
doing is I'm catching the sightlines...

303
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:25,070
...and looking for an exit.

304
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,407
I see the exit sign, too. I'm not worried.

305
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,007
I mean, you were shot.

306
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:33,812
People do all kinds of weird
and amazing stuff when they are scared.

307
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:43,852
I can tell you the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

308
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:46,153
I know that our waitress is left-handed...

309
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:51,031
...and the guy sitting at the counter weighs
215 pounds and can handle himself.

310
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,866
I know the best place to look for a gun
is the cab of the gray truck outside.

311
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:59,376
At this altitude, I can run flat out for
a half-mile before my hands start shaking.

312
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,539
Now why would I know that?

313
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,317
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

Hey.

316
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,861
I slept.

317
00:35:59,271 --> 00:36:01,705
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, well, you were tired.

318
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:03,104
I haven't slept.

319
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,405
Oh, here. For $20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

320
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:10,276
Did you stop for gas?

321
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:15,242
You were pretty out of it.

322
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:23,887
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

323
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:26,956
I don't know.

324
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:30,628
I've thought about it.

325
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,876
Is that it?

326
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:42,346
104.

327
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:44,907
Yeah, that's the address.
No, keep going. Keep going.

328
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:48,811
- Okay. Where?
- Just take a left. Pull in over here.

329
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:50,246
Okay.

330
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,667
So, this is it, right?

331
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:08,261
Yeah, I guess.

332
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:12,902
God, I don't recognize any of this.

333
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:14,840
Okay. I should go.

334
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:20,344
Jason?

335
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:25,746
Oh, God. The money. Right.

336
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:27,488
Yeah.

337
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,353
Here.

338
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:31,288
Thank you. Okay.

339
00:37:32,197 --> 00:37:34,028
Thanks for the ride.

340
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,928
Anytime.

341
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:45,207
Well, you could come up.
I mean, or you can wait here.

342
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:48,677
- I can go check it out. But you could wait.
- Oh, no, no.

343
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,404
You could wait.

344
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:55,051
With you, you would probably
just forget about me if I stayed here.

345
00:37:57,288 --> 00:37:58,880
How could I forget about you?

346
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:02,656
You're the only person I know.

347
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:08,726
Yeah. That's true.

348
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,883
I guess you're not home.

349
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:36,249
Monsieur Bourne, there you are.

350
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:41,959
Monsieur Bourne, I was wondering-
I haven't seen you.

351
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:43,560
Uh, here I am.

352
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:46,359
I think I forgot my key.

353
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:03,347
Hello?

354
00:39:22,474 --> 00:39:24,772
Are you sure this is all yours?

355
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:27,305
I guess.

356
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,829
This is my kitchen.

357
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:10,586
Any cues?

358
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,487
I think I'm in the shipping business.

359
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,816
So it's all coming back?

360
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:24,300
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

361
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:27,229
Sure.

362
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:29,298
Okay.

363
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:55,765
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

364
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:59,401
Yes, sir, Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may I direct your call?

365
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:01,766
Yeah, you're in Paris?
Yes, sir.

366
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:05,274
I'm looking for a guest there.

367
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,207
A Jason Bourne.

368
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:09,508
One moment, please.
Thank you.

369
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:17,719
I'm afraid I have no one
by that name registered.

370
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,258
Okay. Thank you.

371
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:24,391
Wait! No, no. Are you there? Hello?

372
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:25,329
Sir?

373
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,231
Can you check
another name for me, please?

374
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,600
Here, bear with me one second.

375
00:41:34,806 --> 00:41:38,367
John Kane. Kane with a ''K.''
One moment, sir.

376
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:39,774
Thank you.

377
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,088
You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?

378
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:53,050
Yeah, that's right.

379
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,150
You are a friend of his?
Yeah.

380
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:00,061
I have some very bad news for you, sir.

381
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:05,626
I'm sorry to tell you this, but Monsieur
Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago.

382
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:08,800
There was an accident. On the motorway.

383
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:11,340
Apparently, he was killed instantly.

384
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:14,411
Really, I'm terribly sorry
to be the one to tell you this.

385
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,846
When they came for his things,
it was made known for us, you see?

386
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:21,281
Who came?

387
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:22,851
His brother.

388
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:27,256
Did his brother leave a number
or a way to get in touch with him?

389
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:28,724
I think not.

390
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,485
No, I'm sorry.

391
00:42:53,384 --> 00:42:55,978
Jason? There's no hot water.

392
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,147
It's freezing.

393
00:42:58,523 --> 00:43:01,788
I'll go try the water in the kitchen.

394
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:06,057
Why don't you just stay in the bathroom?
I'll see if I can get it hot.

395
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:12,993
Yeah, it's really cold in here, too.

396
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,081
The water is still cold.

397
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:31,052
Yeah, it's cold in the kitchen, too.
I got it running, though.

398
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:35,686
So...

399
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,726
What?

400
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:46,597
Nothing.

401
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:50,538
Are you okay?

402
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:52,902
Yeah.

403
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:07,589
What is it?

404
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,452
Something wrong?

405
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:48,758
Jason!

406
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:53,028
Open that. Tell me what's inside.

407
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:54,562
Who are you?

408
00:45:56,234 --> 00:45:57,633
Who are you?

409
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:00,970
Who are you?

410
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
ARMED AND DANGEROUS

411
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:06,037
Oh, my God.

412
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:09,710
God.

413
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:11,915
Answer me! Who are you?

414
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:14,377
- He's got my picture!
- All right. Hang on.

415
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:16,946
This is Zurich, yesterday!
Don't-

416
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:18,849
I don't know. Where did you get this?

417
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:21,517
Stay there.
How did you get my picture?

418
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:23,651
Where did you get this from?

419
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:25,726
How did you get my... My God!

420
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,664
I'll do this! You stay there. Stay there!

421
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:49,209
- Where are your shoes? Get your shoes.
- Sure. Yeah, sure.

422
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:53,048
He went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

423
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:55,558
We can't stay here. It's not safe.

424
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:59,357
I can get us out of here, but we got to go.
We got to go right now.

425
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:04,734
Okay, look, you can wait.

426
00:47:04,802 --> 00:47:07,270
You can wait for the cops. It's okay.

427
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:10,863
You just wait for them to get here.
But I can't. I got to go.

428
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,970
Marie?

429
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:18,374
Marie?

430
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:27,550
Quiet. Be quiet.

431
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:40,068
Don't look.

432
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:55,118
Code in.

433
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,519
Alpha 37509.

434
00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:01,083
Yeah.

435
00:48:07,098 --> 00:48:07,931
Hang on.

436
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:09,866
Bourne went to Paris, to the apartment.

437
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:13,861
We got him? Tell me.
He killed our man.

438
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:15,801
What? In the apartment?
Yeah.

439
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:19,608
Well, you got to clean that up.
No, I can't clean it up.

440
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,701
There's a body in the street.
So?

441
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:23,439
There's police. This is Paris.

442
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:26,707
Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio information as you can.

443
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:31,518
Okay, you stay here.

444
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:35,055
I'm gonna go find a place for this money.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

445
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:01,410
Hey, I told you to stay in the car.

446
00:50:07,118 --> 00:50:10,110
Jesus Christ. I told you to stay in the car.

447
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,715
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you would come back.

448
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:16,222
Look, you got to go to the cops.

449
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:18,693
Right now.
You got to go before this gets any worse.

450
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:20,559
By myself?
It's gonna be okay.

451
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,566
You're gonna take my passport, okay?
You show this to them.

452
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,795
You have that picture, you have the $20,000.

453
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,803
You tell them everything that happened.
They'll believe you.

454
00:50:28,873 --> 00:50:30,500
They have to believe you.

455
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:37,577
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.

456
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:39,808
Safe?
This is from inside the embassy.

457
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:42,648
- Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
- I don't know.

458
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,713
How can they know we're together?
I'm trying to do the right thing.

459
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,621
That's all.
Right?

460
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:51,286
How'll you make this right
by sending me there alone?

461
00:50:51,362 --> 00:50:53,592
You think I want you to go to the cops?
That's good?

462
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:55,798
- You want to go, fine.
- If you go, I run!

463
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,733
- You tell them what happened!
- I don't know what happened!

464
00:50:58,802 --> 00:51:01,134
I don't know who this guy was
or about that picture!

465
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:03,070
I don't know who I am!

466
00:51:09,813 --> 00:51:10,871
Look, I'm...

467
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:14,111
You think I'm trying to burn you.
I'm trying to do the right thing.

468
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:16,251
Nobody does the right thing.

469
00:51:24,562 --> 00:51:27,531
Look, I can't run with you. I can't.

470
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,098
We run, I got to live like this. I got to...
I don't even know who I'm hiding from.

471
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:36,168
These people know who I am.

472
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,676
Yeah, I got to stay here.
I got to figure this out.

473
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:41,404
So figure it out.

474
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,698
You take care of this car?

475
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:03,058
What do you mean?

476
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:05,931
The tires felt a little splashy
on the way over here.

477
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,402
It pulls a little to the right.

478
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:13,767
POLICE

479
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,556
Last chance, Marie.

480
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:56,379
So...

481
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:59,511
What?
We got a bump coming up.

482
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,546
Turn your head away. Turn your head away.

483
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,641
We can never come back to this car.

484
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:50,811
You understand?

485
00:56:50,988 --> 00:56:55,254
Okay, we're gonna clean it out,
and I'll wipe it down, and we walk away.

486
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,986
- That's it.
- Okay.

487
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:00,825
Okay. And I'll find a place for us to rest.
And I got to think.

488
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:03,092
Do you have a hat or a scarf or something?

489
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,668
- For my hair?
- Yeah. Just until we can change it.

490
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,269
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

491
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:08,704
Okay.

492
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:12,898
HOFFENMEIN MORGUE - PARIS, FRANCE

493
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:48,210
It's not him.

494
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,945
This man was not shot.

495
00:58:12,636 --> 00:58:13,898
What do you have?

496
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:16,298
Wombosi went to the morgue.

497
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:18,397
He saw the body. He didn't buy it.

498
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,641
Where is he now?

499
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:24,139
I told you, I'm not staffed for this.

500
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:26,477
Where is he? Right now!
Where's Wombosi?

501
00:58:26,617 --> 00:58:27,914
They were leaving the morgue.

502
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:29,509
They just left.

503
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:38,458
Sir, what do you want to do?

504
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,744
I need to get the bottle.

505
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:12,065
Hey.

506
01:02:22,352 --> 01:02:24,547
You already cleaned the room?

507
01:02:25,422 --> 01:02:28,516
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

508
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:35,629
Can I walk around
or is it gonna leave any footprints?

509
01:02:42,706 --> 01:02:45,368
You can walk around. It's no problem.

510
01:02:45,876 --> 01:02:48,538
But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.

511
01:02:48,612 --> 01:02:51,809
I think it's best if we leave a room,
that we don't leave a trail.

512
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,939
Why? Where are we going?

513
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:56,781
I need to go to the hotel
where John Michael Kane stayed.

514
01:02:56,853 --> 01:02:58,343
The Hotel Regina.

515
01:02:59,623 --> 01:03:03,081
If I was him,
then they're gonna have some records.

516
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:05,290
We need that hotel bill.

517
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:06,419
Okay.

518
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,458
It gets slightly complicated, though.

519
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,129
Because you're dead.

520
01:03:14,004 --> 01:03:15,232
Right.

521
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:23,003
Please.
They want war, we'll make war.

522
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:26,571
If they want to kill me,
they better kill me the first time.

523
01:03:26,683 --> 01:03:30,119
They better kill me dead.
They better kill me when I'm in my sleep.

524
01:03:30,186 --> 01:03:32,518
Listen to me.
We need these people.

525
01:03:32,656 --> 01:03:35,147
It's hard enough getting people
that we know to help us.

526
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:36,824
We must be careful.

527
01:03:36,927 --> 01:03:37,985
We?

528
01:03:38,662 --> 01:03:39,662
No, you.

529
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:42,094
You need to bring me back
that bastard kid's head...

530
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:46,158
...put it in front of this house,
and show them the war we're fighting.

531
01:03:46,303 --> 01:03:47,634
But that is precisely-

532
01:03:55,946 --> 01:03:57,345
Nykwana!

533
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:09,155
We'll give the watch
a reference check before we go.

534
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:12,153
Okay.

535
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:16,692
What's the pay phone number?

536
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,464
616-2468.

537
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:20,729
Exits?

538
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:22,166
There's three.

539
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:26,536
Service at the back,
side goes to the street past the shops...

540
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,571
...front is the best.

541
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:32,713
If I think I'm being followed, I walk out
with the bag over my right shoulder.

542
01:04:32,816 --> 01:04:34,306
And if there's no taxi?

543
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:38,047
I keep on walking,
don't look back until you make contact.

544
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:42,350
What?

545
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:48,392
We need this, right?

546
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:52,359
Okay.

547
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:05,614
I need distances.

548
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:08,446
You walk in, you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.

549
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:11,714
Count your steps to that spot,
and then remember that number.

550
01:05:12,122 --> 01:05:14,613
Because after I call you,
I can get you moving.

551
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:16,214
You understand?

552
01:05:16,893 --> 01:05:18,224
I also need a head count.

553
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:21,263
How many people from when you walk in
until you get to the desk.

554
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:24,231
How many hotel employees are there?
And obviously security.

555
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,495
And it might not be that easy
to see who they are.

556
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:30,096
So I'll call you, you give me the layout,
and we'll take it from there.

557
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:35,803
Regina.

558
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:37,938
Yes, the house phone in the lobby.

559
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:58,226
What happened?
I-

560
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:01,326
Did something go wrong?
I've got the records.

561
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:05,401
He, this guy at the front desk
was smiling at me.

562
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:09,707
So I thought, you know, all this trouble,
maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

563
01:06:09,779 --> 01:06:12,748
You have the bill?
He made me a photocopy.

564
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:15,949
You just asked for it?

565
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,480
I said I was Mr. Kane's personal assistant.

566
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,525
Okay. That's good thinking.

567
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,808
Sir, can I-
No.

568
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:46,346
Wombosi was assassinated
in his house in the middle of Paris.

569
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:48,980
Yeah, we just heard.

570
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:52,814
It's him. It's Bourne.
We're almost positive.

571
01:06:52,956 --> 01:06:55,220
He had an assignment. He failed.

572
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:58,351
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

573
01:06:58,461 --> 01:06:59,394
Jesus.

574
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:01,454
We think he'll come back in now.

575
01:07:01,898 --> 01:07:03,365
I mean, it's routine.

576
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:05,464
It's like behavioral software.

577
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:09,228
He's following a protocol.

578
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:13,666
Now that he's completed the mission,
we think he'll come back in.

579
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:16,001
They always do.

580
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,006
When?

581
01:07:18,314 --> 01:07:20,373
How long till he checks in?

582
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:22,981
24 hours.
24?

583
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,813
Yeah, it's usually something like that.

584
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:28,488
Then what?

585
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:31,887
I told you we'd clean this up.

586
01:07:31,995 --> 01:07:33,656
It will be clean.

587
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:41,537
I understand you're a dive shop,
but where are you located?

588
01:07:42,906 --> 01:07:44,271
Marseilles?

589
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:11,092
What specifically does
your company supply?

590
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:14,362
I am sorry.
What is your name, monsieur?

591
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:25,937
You've been here for three hours
and you still can't find a print?

592
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,288
What?
Paris police found the vehicle.

593
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:54,943
You've reached Simon Rawlins
at Alliance Security, Maritime Division.

594
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:58,909
Paris office hours are
from 8.:00 a.m. to 5.:00 p.m.

595
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:01,013
I got a lead in Paris.

596
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:04,280
The rest were Marseilles,
and two out in Southampton.

597
01:09:04,354 --> 01:09:06,720
- Paris? It's what?
- Alliance Security. Simon Rawlins.

598
01:09:07,023 --> 01:09:08,183
I got a machine.

599
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:35,015
Mr. Kane?

600
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,286
Mr. Kane!

601
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:42,386
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

602
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:49,556
Mr. Kane. Come right in.
Please have a seat.

603
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:51,031
Thank you.

604
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:54,231
So, this is the Palmer Johnson tri-deck.

605
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,472
I'm assuming you're still in the market.
It's still the same vessel?

606
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:00,742
Yes.

607
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,791
So I'm Kane.

608
01:10:25,935 --> 01:10:27,732
They-
I had a meeting as Kane.

609
01:10:27,804 --> 01:10:29,567
- They said-
- No. I'm definitely Kane.

610
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:32,267
I just had a meeting as Kane
and he knew me as Kane.

611
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:35,342
So I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also just definitely Kane.

612
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:36,708
It's all just boats.

613
01:10:36,813 --> 01:10:38,974
I got blueprints and cameras
and security systems.

614
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:41,375
I just found John Michael Kane's body.

615
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:44,112
In a morgue here in Paris.

616
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:48,917
But if you are John Michael Kane,
whose body do they have?

617
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:59,661
What was the name again?
Kane.

618
01:10:59,836 --> 01:11:00,836
Kane.

619
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:02,268
John Michael Kane.

620
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:04,066
John Michael Kane.

621
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:11,780
Kane. It's number 121.

622
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:14,610
I want to see the body.

623
01:11:14,684 --> 01:11:17,983
Our boss could come back.
We are not supposed to do that.

624
01:11:18,955 --> 01:11:20,149
Come on.

625
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,170
Is this it? I mean, where is he?

626
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:40,275
I don't know.

627
01:11:41,177 --> 01:11:42,337
What's going on?

628
01:11:42,412 --> 01:11:44,903
This guy has come to see the American.
But the body has disappeared.

629
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:46,945
They came yesterday evening...his brother.

630
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,550
He's not in the register.

631
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:50,142
Who are you? What's going on?

632
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:53,514
- Where's the body that goes in here?
- I said someone came last night.

633
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:55,215
I know. Where'd they take the body?

634
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:57,519
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?

635
01:11:57,627 --> 01:12:00,391
People call, they make an appointment,
follow the rules.

636
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:03,693
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place. Serious work.

637
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,230
It's not just to come
in whenever you like.

638
01:12:05,231 --> 01:12:07,702
You're right. We didn't sign in.

639
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:09,130
Get the hell out of here.

640
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:12,003
Fine. I'm just gonna go sign in.
Okay, go.

641
01:12:15,311 --> 01:12:16,311
Is this it?

642
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:18,847
You can't take the book.
This is it?

643
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:21,472
It's okay. There's a pencil in here.
That's fine.

644
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:24,686
Honey, why don't you go wait outside?
Here it is.

645
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:26,085
We can't have-
Okay.

646
01:12:28,191 --> 01:12:31,683
Jason, what just happened in there?
What are you looking for?

647
01:12:31,828 --> 01:12:33,420
Nykwana Wombosi.

648
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:36,529
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.

649
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,658
See?

650
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:41,894
So?
He's in the Alliance brochure.

651
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:43,566
Same guy.

652
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,263
This guy knows.

653
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:22,210
My French sucks. I can't...
It says something about a boat or...

654
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:28,148
I don't understand. What does it say?
You read it. Tell me. What?

655
01:13:30,453 --> 01:13:34,287
It says that 3 weeks before he was killed,
Mr. Wombosi told police...

656
01:13:34,423 --> 01:13:38,223
...that a man came onto his yacht,
five miles off the coast of Marseilles...

657
01:13:38,294 --> 01:13:40,159
...and tried to kill him.

658
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:44,592
It says that he chased the man off the boat
and shot him twice in the back.

659
01:13:45,902 --> 01:13:47,392
It says I'm an assassin.

660
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:29,908
Stop the car.

661
01:14:30,513 --> 01:14:32,811
But no...you said Rue de I...
we're almost there.

662
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:34,611
Just right here, this is good.

663
01:14:34,684 --> 01:14:35,844
I said stop.

664
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:38,017
What's going on?

665
01:14:39,055 --> 01:14:40,055
Well...what's going on?

666
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:41,453
What the hell are you doing?

667
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:43,286
Go. Go.
What are-

668
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:44,857
You gave me too much.

669
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:48,124
We're blown. Come on.
Blown? What is ''blown''?

670
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,323
Monsieur...your change, your change.

671
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:53,163
Sir, please...You can't stay here...
You have to leave.

672
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:56,496
Keep walking.

673
01:14:56,706 --> 01:14:59,641
What do you think they're doing there?
They're on to the hotel.

674
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,708
- No. You don't know that.
- Trust me. Just keep walking.

675
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,194
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?

676
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,031
Jason!

677
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:32,063
This is blown.

678
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:41,607
Marie?
Get away.

679
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:43,912
Stop right there.
Get away from me.

680
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,783
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

681
01:15:45,888 --> 01:15:47,219
Marie.
Is that next?

682
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:49,416
Listen, stay calm. Stay calm.

683
01:15:49,759 --> 01:15:51,920
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.

684
01:15:52,028 --> 01:15:53,359
- We have to be-
- We?

685
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:56,887
The only thing we had in common
was that neither of us knew who you were.

686
01:15:56,966 --> 01:15:58,729
We've passed that now.
Listen!

687
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:02,237
The police'll find us. The people who took
the picture in the embassy...

688
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:05,273
...who killed Wombosi,
they're gonna come here and kill us.

689
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:06,864
The people who you work for.

690
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:13,109
I will take you wherever you need to go.
I'll take you there. I'll leave you there.

691
01:16:13,215 --> 01:16:15,740
You can do what you want.
You never have to see me again.

692
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:18,545
But not here.
If we stay here, we die.

693
01:16:26,662 --> 01:16:29,495
Boy, great police work! Really brilliant!

694
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:33,457
Why don't they just hang out a banner
that says, ''Don't come back!''

695
01:16:34,804 --> 01:16:38,570
Jesus Christ!
What is the French word for ''stakeout''?

696
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:48,312
Okay, this was 16 minutes ago.

697
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:51,445
This is our starting point.

698
01:16:51,654 --> 01:16:55,181
Can't fly, trains are risky. Nicky?
Here.

699
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:58,715
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this.

700
01:16:58,828 --> 01:16:59,988
I'm on it.

701
01:17:01,297 --> 01:17:03,925
You said 24 hours, and he's not back.

702
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:08,332
No. But we got a good idea where he is.

703
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:11,534
You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.

704
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,473
He trashed an American consulate.
He's on the run in Europe.

705
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:17,937
You don't know why. I got to stand
before an oversight committee.

706
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:19,708
What will I say about Treadstone?

707
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:22,045
You're worried about a budget meeting?

708
01:17:22,318 --> 01:17:25,481
We don't take care of this,
we don't make it to the men's room.

709
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:28,555
Now, is that clear enough for you?

710
01:17:28,858 --> 01:17:30,723
We will burn for this.

711
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,518
We will both of us burn.

712
01:17:35,131 --> 01:17:38,828
All right, I want two teams.
Daryl, Ray, stay on the grids.

713
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:41,192
Brian, Harris, Steve...

714
01:17:41,504 --> 01:17:43,233
...I want to work on this girl.

715
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:46,499
And this residency pattern?
We started it.

716
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:47,575
Get it out.

717
01:17:52,014 --> 01:17:54,915
We cross-referenced
numbers from her relatives.

718
01:17:55,017 --> 01:17:57,178
When we found convergence,
we took the numbers...

719
01:17:57,253 --> 01:18:01,417
...back-checked them, ran a search merge
with other data we had, which wasn't much.

720
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,855
Pins. These pins.

721
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:06,391
These are all the places we think
she's lived in the last six years.

722
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:09,693
One, two, three, four, five.

723
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:11,526
That's our pool.

724
01:18:17,006 --> 01:18:18,371
No answer.

725
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,032
How many times you let it ring?

726
01:18:21,443 --> 01:18:24,879
- Look, if you don't want to go, I'll hitch.
- I said I'd take you.

727
01:18:27,016 --> 01:18:28,881
Those are the targets.

728
01:18:29,285 --> 01:18:33,949
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass!
I don't care what you do!

729
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,956
I want to know everything you can tell me
about what's going on at those locations.

730
01:18:57,213 --> 01:18:59,238
How do you know
he still owns this?

731
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:03,946
Eamon always had money.
He would never sell this.

732
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:35,109
Marie?

733
01:19:35,184 --> 01:19:36,310
What?

734
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:39,520
We got to go.

735
01:19:40,422 --> 01:19:41,422
What?

736
01:19:41,624 --> 01:19:42,624
We got to go.

737
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:47,227
I thought it would...

738
01:19:53,402 --> 01:19:56,838
Shit, that's Eamon. I'll talk to him.
We're leaving.

739
01:20:00,309 --> 01:20:03,039
Eamon. Surprise.

740
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:06,410
It's me, Marie. Wow, God...

741
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,377
...there's a really good reason for this.

742
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:11,177
There bloody well better be.

743
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:13,881
Daddy!
Hang on. Hang on.

744
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:18,457
I had no idea you would be here.

745
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:22,030
Well, why would I be here?
It's only my bloody house, right?

746
01:20:22,898 --> 01:20:23,922
Yeah.

747
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:26,928
Did she get you into this?

748
01:20:28,771 --> 01:20:30,398
It was just gonna be for a day.

749
01:20:30,506 --> 01:20:33,066
Daddy, Alain has to go pee!

750
01:20:34,043 --> 01:20:36,944
All right, all right, come on. Here.
Get out of the car.

751
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,007
Okay, in you go.

752
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:41,640
Come on, Alain.

753
01:20:43,085 --> 01:20:44,177
I'm sorry. I...

754
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:47,184
I thought it would be okay.
But I guess I was wrong.

755
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:48,780
- Let's find Mommy.
- Mommy?

756
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:51,249
Mommy is away for two days, thank God.

757
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:58,289
You've got yourself all tied up here.

758
01:20:58,367 --> 01:20:59,459
Okay.

759
01:21:03,806 --> 01:21:05,296
What's he do for a living?

760
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:08,267
He used to be in shipping.

761
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,873
Is he good for you?

762
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:14,638
Are you happy?

763
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:17,245
You know me. I try too hard.

764
01:21:41,076 --> 01:21:42,475
Here you go.

765
01:21:43,345 --> 01:21:44,744
Sleep well.

766
01:21:44,813 --> 01:21:46,178
Good night.

767
01:21:48,017 --> 01:21:49,985
I'll sleep on the floor.

768
01:21:56,358 --> 01:21:58,792
This was when?
11:45 a.m.

769
01:21:58,861 --> 01:22:01,489
Which is definitely within
the driving range of Paris.

770
01:22:02,364 --> 01:22:04,457
The call came from a rest stop.

771
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:06,857
Yeah. What's this yellow pin?

772
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:08,766
She spent two months there in 1997.

773
01:22:09,171 --> 01:22:11,002
Closest town is Riom.

774
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:16,342
We took her family’s phone records
and collated the international calls.

775
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:18,276
They were in Paris at 2.:00 a.m.

776
01:22:18,447 --> 01:22:21,314
They can't fly. The train's too dangerous.

777
01:22:21,383 --> 01:22:24,147
He knows better than to go anywhere
we might track him.

778
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,215
So this is our best guess.

779
01:23:25,514 --> 01:23:28,677
- What are you doing?
- The kids. I was worried. I couldn’t sleep.

780
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,775
You'll wake them up. We got to go.

781
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:33,021
I don't want to know who I am anymore.

782
01:23:33,255 --> 01:23:36,383
I don't care. I don't want to know.

783
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:42,463
Come on. We'll talk about-
I want to forget everything.

784
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:44,089
It's okay.

785
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:46,429
I don't care who I am
or what I did.

786
01:23:48,036 --> 01:23:49,094
It's okay.

787
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:50,569
We have this money.

788
01:23:51,974 --> 01:23:53,373
We can hide.

789
01:23:55,978 --> 01:23:58,776
Can we do that?
Is there any chance you can do that?

790
01:24:06,488 --> 01:24:07,921
I don't know.

791
01:24:13,662 --> 01:24:14,993
Come on.

792
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:27,405
Here, boy! Here, boy!

793
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:29,071
'Morning.

794
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:31,504
Christ. You were up early.

795
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:33,809
Bless you for making coffee.

796
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:44,186
One night. You weren't kidding.

797
01:24:45,427 --> 01:24:46,860
For a change.

798
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,262
He's not there either.

799
01:24:50,165 --> 01:24:52,963
And you looked by the car?
He's not anywhere.

800
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:55,698
All right, let me get dressed.

801
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:58,295
Who?
Bloody dog's gone missing.

802
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:00,031
Does that happen a lot?

803
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:02,610
What? That mutt?
Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.

804
01:25:02,678 --> 01:25:04,509
It's always something, right?

805
01:25:06,882 --> 01:25:08,645
Get in the basement.

806
01:25:08,784 --> 01:25:09,876
What?

807
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:13,488
- Get everyone in the basement.
- What are you talking about?

808
01:25:14,056 --> 01:25:17,492
You're in danger. Your family’s in danger.
I don't have time to explain.

809
01:25:17,559 --> 01:25:19,493
Wait a minute. What-
Eamon.

810
01:25:19,628 --> 01:25:20,993
You should go.

811
01:25:21,063 --> 01:25:23,691
What have you done?
It's not her. It's me.

812
01:25:23,799 --> 01:25:27,235
You need to get out of sight
and in the basement as quick as you can.

813
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:28,863
Daddy.

814
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:35,473
I'm sorry.

815
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:36,841
Let's go.

816
01:25:55,664 --> 01:25:57,598
The phone is dead.
Yeah.

817
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,391
Jason, who's out there? Who is it?

818
01:26:18,887 --> 01:26:20,354
What are you doing?

819
01:26:21,123 --> 01:26:22,385
Oh, no.

820
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:29,555
We should never have come here.
I... These children...

821
01:26:29,798 --> 01:26:31,231
That's not gonna happen.

822
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:01,947
Where is it? Where's the weapon?

823
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:08,681
Who else is out here?
Who else? How many you got with you?

824
01:29:08,757 --> 01:29:10,384
I'm not gonna ask you again.

825
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:13,227
I work alone. Like you.

826
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:17,561
We always work alone.

827
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,532
What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome?

828
01:29:20,602 --> 01:29:21,933
Paris?

829
01:29:24,105 --> 01:29:25,800
Treadstone, both of us.

830
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:27,568
Treadstone?
Which one?

831
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:29,234
Paris. I live in Paris.

832
01:29:29,377 --> 01:29:31,038
You get the headaches?

833
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:33,013
Yeah.

834
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:35,005
I get such bad headaches.

835
01:29:35,383 --> 01:29:37,783
You know at night
when you're driving a car?

836
01:29:37,853 --> 01:29:39,514
Maybe it's the headlights.

837
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:41,350
What is Treadstone?

838
01:29:42,457 --> 01:29:44,584
Treadstone said pills.

839
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:48,293
They said go to Paris.

840
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:50,760
Is Treadstone in Paris?

841
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:54,324
Look at this.

842
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:58,639
Look at what they make you give.

843
01:30:23,565 --> 01:30:25,396
All right, all right.

844
01:30:25,567 --> 01:30:28,297
All right, Claudia,
get in the front and put your belt on.

845
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:30,600
All right, we're gonna put you in the back.

846
01:30:30,705 --> 01:30:32,832
All right, get in the front, Claudia.

847
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:40,204
I'm not waiting, Marie.

848
01:30:40,482 --> 01:30:42,313
- One minute, Eamon.
- I'm not waiting!

849
01:30:42,384 --> 01:30:44,011
Please!

850
01:30:45,086 --> 01:30:46,246
Take it.

851
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:48,754
I took out $30,000.
The rest is yours.

852
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:51,726
That's it?
That's all I got.

853
01:30:54,663 --> 01:30:56,153
No, that's not what I meant.

854
01:30:56,231 --> 01:31:00,759
This is not gonna stop, Marie.
You got to get out now. Away from me.

855
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:04,728
You got to get out.
You got to start running.

856
01:31:05,273 --> 01:31:07,002
You get low, you stay low.

857
01:31:07,075 --> 01:31:08,770
No more friends. Nothing familiar.

858
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:15,040
There's enough in there for you
to make a life. Any life.

859
01:31:15,283 --> 01:31:16,648
I'm out of here, Marie!

860
01:31:16,718 --> 01:31:17,776
Hey!

861
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:22,754
Get in the car. You got to go.

862
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:30,228
What are you gonna do?

863
01:31:31,066 --> 01:31:32,294
I'll end it.

864
01:31:33,068 --> 01:31:34,365
Go ahead.

865
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:37,231
Please.

866
01:32:55,684 --> 01:32:57,276
Code in, please.

867
01:32:58,286 --> 01:32:59,514
Code in.

868
01:33:03,825 --> 01:33:05,053
Code in.

869
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:10,797
Who is this?

870
01:33:16,571 --> 01:33:18,368
Who the hell are you?

871
01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:23,806
The man you sent is dead.

872
01:33:23,878 --> 01:33:26,244
So whoever this is, you
better start talking.

873
01:33:28,016 --> 01:33:29,176
Hello, Jason.

874
01:33:30,552 --> 01:33:32,520
So, what are we into now?

875
01:33:37,959 --> 01:33:41,417
It only goes two ways. Either you come in
and let us make this right...

876
01:33:41,496 --> 01:33:43,521
...or we'll keep going
until we're satisfied.

877
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:45,392
You mean until you kill me.

878
01:33:47,368 --> 01:33:49,928
I can't fix this
if I don't know what the problem is.

879
01:33:50,205 --> 01:33:52,673
Tell me what we're into,
and I'll do the best I can.

880
01:34:00,915 --> 01:34:03,440
Why don't you talk to Marie, Jason?

881
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,056
Let's ask Marie what she wants.
I don't think she gives a shit.

882
01:34:09,457 --> 01:34:10,685
She's dead.

883
01:34:19,634 --> 01:34:22,125
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

884
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:24,204
She was slowing me down.

885
01:34:25,406 --> 01:34:28,136
All we've been doing right from-
Enough.

886
01:34:28,243 --> 01:34:29,243
Enough.

887
01:34:30,578 --> 01:34:32,910
5:30 p.m. Paris.

888
01:34:33,114 --> 01:34:34,809
Today. Pont Neuf.

889
01:34:35,116 --> 01:34:37,550
Come alone,
you walk to the middle of that bridge.

890
01:34:37,652 --> 01:34:39,552
You take off your jacket. Face east.

891
01:34:39,788 --> 01:34:41,688
I'll redial this number.
Wait!

892
01:34:51,966 --> 01:34:56,403
First flight out. Tell Nicky I'll call
from the car. Tell her to find Picot. Go.

893
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,568
So...

894
01:35:01,276 --> 01:35:02,766
What are we gonna do?

895
01:35:02,977 --> 01:35:05,275
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

896
01:35:05,346 --> 01:35:07,007
Can you really bring him in?

897
01:35:07,982 --> 01:35:09,813
I think we're past that, don't you?

898
01:35:10,451 --> 01:35:12,078
Do you have a better idea?

899
01:35:12,153 --> 01:35:14,849
You've given me nothing
but a trail of collateral damage...

900
01:35:14,956 --> 01:35:17,322
...from Zurich to Paris.
I couldn’t do much worse.

901
01:35:17,425 --> 01:35:20,258
Why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

902
01:35:20,328 --> 01:35:22,694
Maybe you can talk him to death.

903
01:36:39,741 --> 01:36:42,710
The bus, the tour bus, second level.

904
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:46,279
Negative on the target.

905
01:36:48,783 --> 01:36:50,910
Position one?
Negative.

906
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:53,247
Position two?
Negative.

907
01:37:08,236 --> 01:37:10,796
Position three, motorcycle.

908
01:37:11,873 --> 01:37:13,204
Negative.

909
01:37:13,374 --> 01:37:14,398
Negative.

910
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,800
Jason?

911
01:37:39,801 --> 01:37:43,737
I told you to come alone.
I guess that was too complicated.

912
01:37:43,838 --> 01:37:45,669
So try this: I'm gone.

913
01:37:50,144 --> 01:37:51,144
Fuck.

914
01:37:57,952 --> 01:37:59,783
Get Nicky on the phone.

915
01:38:15,603 --> 01:38:16,536
Yeah?

916
01:38:16,537 --> 01:38:19,097
How long to wipe down the room
and move it?

917
01:38:19,173 --> 01:38:21,141
Get rid of everything?
Yeah.

918
01:38:21,843 --> 01:38:24,607
Two to three hours.
All right, get started.

919
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:33,016
Listen, no breaks.

920
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:35,988
Two men outside, one in the lobby.
And keep your eyes open.

921
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,721
Keep the truck?
Keep the truck.

922
01:38:41,129 --> 01:38:44,189
I'm gonna close this unit down.
We'll move the gear in the truck.

923
01:39:01,482 --> 01:39:04,212
They were covering Spain, MaIta, Morocco.

924
01:39:04,318 --> 01:39:06,878
Yes, all local police radio traffic.

925
01:39:06,988 --> 01:39:10,515
No, for northern Europe
we need an authorized directive. Yeah.

926
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:14,924
Okay, they're on it. We'll have
a satellite download in 30 minutes.

927
01:40:24,298 --> 01:40:26,198
Where's your field box?

928
01:40:31,205 --> 01:40:34,003
- Where's your field box?
- It's right there.

929
01:40:34,242 --> 01:40:36,574
The whole system's gone haywire.

930
01:40:37,445 --> 01:40:39,675
That's this window right here.

931
01:40:40,214 --> 01:40:41,977
Dining room window?

932
01:40:43,484 --> 01:40:45,008
I don't get it.

933
01:40:47,155 --> 01:40:49,214
Dead. The phones are dead.

934
01:40:51,159 --> 01:40:52,558
It's Bourne, isn't it?

935
01:40:53,628 --> 01:40:54,993
Just quiet.

936
01:41:42,577 --> 01:41:44,238
You move, you die.

937
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:45,869
Bourne.

938
01:41:46,247 --> 01:41:47,544
Gun down.

939
01:41:53,588 --> 01:41:54,588
In there.

940
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:58,119
Okay, so what do you want-

941
01:41:58,259 --> 01:41:59,624
Treadstone.

942
01:42:00,194 --> 01:42:02,719
You better take a look around.
There's not much left.

943
01:42:02,797 --> 01:42:05,265
- Are you Treadstone?
- Am I Treadstone? Me?

944
01:42:05,366 --> 01:42:07,391
What the hell are you talking about?

945
01:42:07,468 --> 01:42:08,935
He's lost it.

946
01:42:09,136 --> 01:42:13,368
You better start filling in the blanks here!
'Cause I thought we were on the same side.

947
01:42:13,474 --> 01:42:14,702
Whose side is that?

948
01:42:14,809 --> 01:42:18,643
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
You don't have a goddamn clue!

949
01:42:19,146 --> 01:42:20,443
Who am I?

950
01:42:20,548 --> 01:42:22,482
You're U.S. government property!

951
01:42:22,617 --> 01:42:25,780
You're a malfunctioning $30 million weapon!

952
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,054
You're a total goddamn catastrophe!

953
01:42:28,155 --> 01:42:31,215
And, by God, if it kills me,
you'll tell me how this happened.

954
01:42:31,325 --> 01:42:34,294
- Why are you trying to kill me?
- What happened in Marseilles?

955
01:42:34,362 --> 01:42:36,660
You sent me to kill Wombosi.

956
01:42:37,331 --> 01:42:40,391
Kill Wombosi?
Yeah, we can do that any time we want.

957
01:42:40,468 --> 01:42:42,834
I can send Nicky to do that,
for Christ's sake.

958
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:45,903
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead
three weeks ago.

959
01:42:45,973 --> 01:42:49,636
He was supposed to have died in a way
that the only possible explanation was...

960
01:42:50,077 --> 01:42:53,103
...that he'd been murdered
by a member of his own entourage.

961
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:54,977
I don't send you to kill.

962
01:42:55,116 --> 01:42:56,743
I send you to be invisible.

963
01:42:56,817 --> 01:42:59,081
I send you because you don't exist.

964
01:42:59,287 --> 01:43:01,414
I want to know what happened in Marseilles.

965
01:43:01,489 --> 01:43:04,287
I don't remember what happened
in Marseilles.

966
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:07,187
Bullshit! This is unacceptable, soldier.

967
01:43:07,295 --> 01:43:08,956
You hear me? You failed!

968
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:10,497
- Unacceptable?
- You failed!

969
01:43:10,631 --> 01:43:14,294
- You failed and you're gonna tell me why!
- I can't tell you! I don't remember!

970
01:43:14,502 --> 01:43:17,596
You brought Kane to life.
You put together a meeting with Wombosi.

971
01:43:17,672 --> 01:43:20,300
You found the security company.
You broke into the office!

972
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:24,341
For Christ's sake, you picked the yacht
as the goddamn strike point!

973
01:43:32,053 --> 01:43:33,384
You picked the boat.

974
01:43:33,587 --> 01:43:36,420
You picked the day. You tracked the crew.

975
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:38,014
The food, the fuel!

976
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:40,855
You told us where. You told us when.

977
01:43:41,462 --> 01:43:43,987
You hid out on that boat five days.

978
01:43:44,165 --> 01:43:46,725
You were in, Jason. You were in!

979
01:43:46,834 --> 01:43:48,324
It was over!

980
01:44:48,963 --> 01:44:50,760
No, you do remember.

981
01:44:53,768 --> 01:44:55,133
Don't you?

982
01:45:01,375 --> 01:45:03,400
I don't want to do this anymore.

983
01:45:04,645 --> 01:45:07,205
I don't think that's a
decision you can make.

984
01:45:12,486 --> 01:45:14,920
Jason Bourne is dead. Do you hear me?

985
01:45:15,156 --> 01:45:16,885
He drowned two weeks ago.

986
01:45:16,991 --> 01:45:19,323
You're gonna go tell them Bourne is dead.
Understand?

987
01:45:19,927 --> 01:45:21,417
Where are you gonna go?

988
01:45:22,363 --> 01:45:26,060
I swear, if I even feel somebody behind me,
there is no measure to how fast...

989
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:29,401
...and how hard I will bring this fight
to your doorstep.

990
01:45:29,637 --> 01:45:31,571
I'm on my own side now.

991
01:49:06,353 --> 01:49:07,353
It's done.

992
01:49:08,155 --> 01:49:09,622
Shut it down.

993
01:49:47,928 --> 01:49:50,795
The Treadstone project
has already been terminated.

994
01:49:50,864 --> 01:49:54,061
It was designed primarily
as a sort of advanced game program.

995
01:49:54,134 --> 01:49:56,864
We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.

996
01:49:56,937 --> 01:50:00,532
But quite honestly,
for a strictly theoretical exercise...

997
01:50:00,607 --> 01:50:02,939
...the cost-benefit ratio was just too high.

998
01:50:03,043 --> 01:50:05,102
It's all but decommissioned at this point.

999
01:50:05,212 --> 01:50:06,770
All right, what's next?

1000
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,212
Okay, this is...

1001
01:50:10,818 --> 01:50:12,046
...Blackbriar.

1002
01:50:12,119 --> 01:50:15,316
Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program...

1003
01:50:15,422 --> 01:50:19,483
...that we really feel has good traction
to it. It's got legs. It'll run and run.

1004
01:50:19,927 --> 01:50:23,761
It combines elements of proactive
and reactive fields of security...

1005
01:51:07,341 --> 01:51:08,968
This your store?

1006
01:51:09,042 --> 01:51:10,168
Yeah.

1007
01:51:11,645 --> 01:51:15,775
It's nice. It's a little
hard to find, but...

1008
01:51:20,287 --> 01:51:22,050
Think I could rent a scooter?

1009
01:51:26,193 --> 01:51:27,683
You have ID?

1010
01:51:29,129 --> 01:51:30,494
Not really.

1011
01:51:55,756 --> 01:51:57,781
