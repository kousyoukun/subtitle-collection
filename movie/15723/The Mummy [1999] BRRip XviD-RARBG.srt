00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,204
What are you doing here?

2
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,010
Who has touched you?

-No.
-Only you can resurrect me!

I won't leave you!

8
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,010
Get away from me!

9
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,150
You shall live again!

10
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,150
I will resurrect you!

11
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,120
My body is no longer his temple!

And what of this one?

15
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,020
-Should we kill him?
-No.

16
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,110
The desert will kill him.
