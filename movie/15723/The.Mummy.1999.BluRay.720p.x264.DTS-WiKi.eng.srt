1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,100
Thebes: City of the Living.

2
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,900
Crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

3
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,700
Home of lmhotep, Pharaoh's high priest.

4
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,400
Keeper of the Dead.

5
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,700
Birthplace ofAnck-su-namun,
Pharaoh's mistress.

6
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,100
No other man was allowed to touch her.

7
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,300
But for their love,
they were willing to risk life itself.

8
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,800
What are you doing here?

9
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,400
Who has touched you?

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,500
Imhotep!

11
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,500
My priest!

12
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,100
Pharaoh's bodyguards.

13
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,100
You must go! Save yourself!

14
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,000
-No.
-Only you can resurrect me!

15
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I won't leave you!

16
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,300
Get away from me!

17
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,300
You shall live again!

18
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,600
I will resurrect you!

19
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,000
My body is no longer his temple!

20
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,700
To resurrect Anck-su-namun...

21
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,700
...lmhotep and his priests
broke into her crypt and stole her body.

22
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,600
They raced into the desert...

23
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,100
...taking Anck-su-namun's corpse
to Hamunaptra, City of the Dead...

24
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,500
HAMUNAPTRA - 1290 B.C.

25
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,900
...ancient burial site
for the sons ofpharaohs...

26
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,700
...and resting place for the wealth of Egypt.

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,700
For his love, lmhotep dared the gods' anger
by going deep into the city...

28
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,000
...where he took the black Book
of the Dead from its holy resting place.

29
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,300
Anck-su-namun's soul had been sent
to the dark underworld...

30
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,300
...her vital organs removed and placed
in five sacred canopic jars.

31
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,400
Anck-su-namun's soul
had come back from the dead.

32
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,600
But Pharaoh's bodyguards
had followed lmhotep and stopped him...

33
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,100
...before the ritual could be completed.

34
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,100
Imhotep's priests were condemned
to be mummified alive.

35
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
As for lmhotep...

36
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,900
...he was condemned
to endure the Hom-Dai...

37
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,600
...the worst of all ancient curses...

38
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,000
...one so horrible,
it had never before been bestowed.

39
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,900
He was to remain sealed
inside his sarcophagus...

40
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
...the undead for all of eternity.

41
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,200
The Magi would never allow him
to be released...

42
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,100
...for he would arise a walking disease,
a plague upon mankind...

43
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,600
...an unholy flesh-eater
with the strength of ages...

44
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
...power over the sands...

45
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,100
...and the glory of invincibility.

46
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,600
HAMUNAPTRA - 1923

47
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,700
For 3,000 years,
men and armies fought over this land...

48
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
...never knowing what evil lay beneath it.

49
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,200
And for 3,000 years...

50
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,000
...we, the Magi, the descendants of
Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards, kept watch.

51
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,500
You just got promoted.

52
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Steady!

53
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,400
You're with me on this one, right?

54
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,500
Your strength gives me strength.

55
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,200
Steady!

56
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,700
Wait for me!

57
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,100
Steady!

58
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,700
Fire!

59
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,100
Run, Beni! Run!

60
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,600
Get inside! Get inside!

61
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,800
Don't you close that door!

62
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,900
Don't you close that door!

63
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,400
The Creature remains undiscovered.

64
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,300
And what of this one?

65
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
-Should we kill him?
-No.

66
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,300
The desert will kill him.

67
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,100
CAIRO, EGYPT
3 YEARS LATER

68
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,900
"Sacred Stones.

69
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
"Sculpture and Aesthetics.

70
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,200
"Socrates, Seth, volume one, volume two...

71
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,300
"...and volume three."

72
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,400
And....

73
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,100
"Tuthmosis"? What are you doing here?

74
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,300
T....

75
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
"T."

76
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm going to put you where you belong.

77
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,400
Help.

78
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,400
What....

79
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,600
Look at this!

80
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,200
Sons of the pharaohs!

81
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,100
Give me frogs, flies, locusts...

82
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,000
...anything but you!

83
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

84
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,800
I am so very sorry. It was an accident.

85
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
When Ramses destroyed Syria,
that was an accident.

86
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
You...are a catastrophe!

87
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,100
Look at my library!

88
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Why do I put up with you?

89
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,200
Well, you put up with me because I can....

90
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,900
I can read and write Ancient Egyptian...

91
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,800
...and I can decipher hieroglyphics
and hieratic...

92
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
...and I'm the only person
within a thousand miles...

93
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,600
...who knows how to properly code
and catalog this library, that's why.

94
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,300
I put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

95
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,000
That's why!

96
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Allah rest their souls.

97
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,900
I don't care how you do it,
I don't care how long it takes.

98
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Straighten up this meshiver!

99
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,700
Hello?

100
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,800
Abdul?

101
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,300
Mohammed?

102
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,600
Bob?

103
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,200
Have you no respect for the dead?

104
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,500
Of course I do!

105
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,500
But sometimes, I'd rather like to join them.

106
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Do it soon before you ruin my career...

107
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,100
...the way you've ruined yours. Get out!

108
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,100
My dear, sweet baby sister...

109
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
...l'll have you know...

110
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
...that at this precise moment
my career is on a high note.

111
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
"High note." Please, I'm really not
in the mood for you.

112
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,700
I've just made a bit of a mess
in the library...

113
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,700
...and the Bembridge scholars
rejected my application again.

114
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,900
They say I don't have enough experience
in the field.

115
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,300
You'll always have me, old mum.

116
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,300
Besides, I have just the thing
to cheer you up.

117
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,700
No, Jonathan,
not another worthless trinket.

118
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,300
If I have to take one more piece
of junk to the curator to try and...

119
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
...sell for you....

120
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
Where did you get this?

121
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
On a dig down in Thebes.

122
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,400
My whole life I've never found anything.
Please tell me I've found something.

123
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
-Jonathan.
-Yes?

124
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think you've found something.

125
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,600
See the cartouche.

126
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,000
It's the official royal seal of Seti the First,
I'm sure of it.

127
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,900
-Perhaps.
-Two questions:

128
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,900
Who the hell was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

129
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,600
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty...

130
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,300
...the wealthiest pharaoh of all.

131
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
Good. I like this fellow.

132
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,200
-I like him a lot.
-I've already dated the map.

133
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,400
It's almost 3,000 years old.
And if you look at the hieratic just here...

134
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
...it's Hamunaptra.

135
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,200
Dear God, don't be ridiculous.

136
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,900
We're scholars, not treasure hunters.

137
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers...

138
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,000
...to amuse Greek and Roman tourists.

139
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,200
I know all the blather that the city
is protected by the curse of a mummy...

140
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,700
...but my research leads me to believe
that the city may have actually existed.

141
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,900
Do you mean the Hamunaptra?

142
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes. The City of the Dead...

143
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,500
...where the pharaohs presumably hid
the wealth of Egypt.

144
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Yes, in a big underground
treasure chamber.

145
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,700
Come on. Everybody knows the story.

146
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,100
The necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command.

147
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,900
Turn a switch and it would disappear
into the sand with the treasure.

148
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,100
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum--

149
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,700
My goodness! Look at that!

150
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,400
You've burnt the part with the lost city.

151
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
It's for the best, I'm sure.

152
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Many men have wasted their lives
in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra.

153
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,300
No one's ever found it.

154
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,100
Most have never returned.

155
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Come! Step over the threshold.

156
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,000
Welcome to Cairo Prison,
my humble home.

157
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

158
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,500
-I was mistaken.
-You lied.

159
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
I lie to everybody. Why not to you?

160
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,100
-I'm your sister.
-Which makes you more gullible.

161
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,400
-You stole it from a drunk!
-Picked his pocket, actually.

162
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Stop being ridiculous.

163
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,000
-Why exactly is this man in prison?
-This I did not know.

164
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,100
But when I heard you were coming,
I asked him that myself.

165
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
What did he say?

166
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
He said he was just looking
for a good time.

167
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,200
-This is the man that you stole it from?
-Yes, exactly.

168
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,700
-Why don't we go sniff out a spot of tiffin--
-Who are you?

169
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,300
-And who's the broad?
-"Broad"?

170
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,300
I'm just a local sort of missionary chap,
spreading the good word.

171
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,200
-This is my sister, Evy.
-How do you do?

172
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
-I guess she's not a total loss.
-I beg your pardon.

173
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,800
-I'll be right back.
-Ask him about the box.

174
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,100
We have found.... Hello. Excuse me.

175
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
We both found your puzzle box...

176
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,700
...and we've come to ask you about it.

177
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,800
-No.
-No.

178
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,100
You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

179
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,600
How do you know the box pertains
to Hamunaptra?

180
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,900
Because that's where I was
when I found it. I was there.

181
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
But how do we know
that's not a load of pig's wallow?

182
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,500
-Do I know you?
-No, I've just got one of those faces.

183
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,000
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

184
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,900
Yeah.

185
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,600
-You swear?
-Every damn day.

186
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,100
-I didn't mean that.
-I know. I was there.

187
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,400
Seti's place. City of the Dead.

188
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
Could you tell me how to get there?

189
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
I mean, the exact location.

190
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
-You want to know?
-Well, yes.

191
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,200
-Do you really want to know?
-Yes.

192
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,700
Then get me the hell out of here!

193
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Do it, lady!

194
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,100
Where are they taking him?

195
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,400
To be hanged.

196
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,100
Apparently, he had a very good time.

197
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,400
I'll give you 100 pounds
to save this man's life.

198
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,700
Madam, I would pay 100 pounds
just to see him hang.

199
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,900
-200 pounds!
-Proceed!

200
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,000
300 pounds!

201
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,800
Any last requests, pig?

202
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,700
Yeah. Loosen the knot and let me go.

203
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,300
Of course we don't let him go!

204
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,900
500 pounds!

205
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,000
And what else?

206
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm a very lonely man.

207
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
No!

208
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,100
His neck did not break!

209
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm so sorry. Now we must
watch him strangle to death.

210
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,100
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

211
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,100
-You lie.
-I would never!

212
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,100
This filthy, godless son of a pig
knows where to find the City of the Dead?

213
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,800
-Yes!
-Truly?

214
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
And if you cut him down,
we will give you....

215
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,500
-Ten percent.
-Fifty percent.

216
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,300
-Twenty.
-Forty.

217
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,900
-Thirty!
-Twenty-five.

218
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
Deal.

219
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
Cut him down!

220
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,200
GIZA PORT - CAIRO

221
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,600
Do you really think he'll come?

222
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Yes, undoubtedly, knowing my luck.

223
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
He may be a cowboy, but I know the breed.
His word is his word.

224
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,000
Personally, I think he's filthy,
rude, a complete scoundrel.

225
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,700
-I don't like him one bit.
-Anyone I know?

226
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,900
Hello.

227
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,800
Smashing day for the start
of an adventure, O'Connell?

228
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,400
Yeah, smashing.

229
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,300
No, I'd never steal from a partner, partner.

230
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,700
That reminds me,
no hard feelings about the....

231
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,500
-Happens all the time.
-Mr. O'Connell.

232
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,200
Can you look me in the eye and guarantee
this isn't some kind of a flimflam?

233
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,900
-Because if it is, I am warning you--
-You're warning me?

234
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,300
Let me put it this way, my whole
damn garrison believed in this so much...

235
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,400
...they marched across Libya
and into Egypt to find that city.

236
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,700
When we got there, all we found...

237
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,600
...was sand and blood.

238
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
Let me get your bags.

239
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,900
Yes, you're right.

240
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,000
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

241
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,900
Bright good morning to all.

242
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,300
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

243
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,900
I'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

244
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,700
Quit playing with your glasses
and cut the deck, Burns.

245
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,500
Without my glasses
I can't see the deck to cut it, Dave.

246
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,200
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

247
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,300
-I only gamble with my life, never money.
-Never?

248
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,300
What if I was to bet you $500
that we get to Hamunaptra before you?

249
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,400
-You're looking for Hamunaptra?
-Damn straight we are.

250
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,800
-And who says we are?
-He does.

251
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,200
Well, how about it?

252
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,700
Is it a bet?

253
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,900
-All right, you're on.
-What makes you so confident, sir?

254
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,500
-What makes you?
-We got a man who's actually been there.

255
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,000
What a coincidence, because O'Connell--

256
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,000
Whose play is it? ls it my play?

257
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,600
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

258
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

259
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,100
The only thing that scares me
are your manners.

260
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,800
Still angry about that kiss?

261
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,900
If you call that a kiss.

262
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,400
Did I miss something?

263
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,000
Are we going into battle?

264
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,600
Lady, there's something out there.

265
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Something underneath that sand.

266
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
I'm hoping to find a certain artifact.

267
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,900
A book, actually.

268
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,300
My brother thinks there's treasure.

269
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,800
-What do you think's out there?
-In a word, evil.

270
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,900
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed.

271
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,700
Look, I don't believe in fairy tales
and hokum, Mr. O'Connell...

272
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,300
...but I think one of the most famous books
in history is buried there.

273
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,900
The Book ofAmun-Ra.

274
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,900
It contains within it all the secret
incantations of the old kingdom.

275
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,900
It's what first interested me in Egypt
when I was a child.

276
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,100
It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.

277
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,500
And the fact that they say it's made
of pure gold makes no never mind to you?

278
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
-Right?
-You know your history.

279
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,800
I know my treasure.

280
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,800
By the way...

281
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,400
...why did you kiss me?

282
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I was about to be hanged.
It seemed like a good idea.

283
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,100
What? What did I say?

284
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,000
What a surprise!
My good friend, you're alive!

285
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,300
I was so very, very worried.

286
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,900
Well, if it ain't my little buddy, Beni.

287
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
-I think I'll kill you.
-Think of my children.

288
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,000
You don't have any children.

289
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,800
-Someday I might.
-Shut up!

290
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,300
So you're the one who's leading
the Americans. I might have known.

291
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,900
So what's the scam? You take them
into the desert, and leave them to rot?

292
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
Unfortunately, no.

293
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,900
These Americans are smart.

294
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,700
They pay me half now,
half when we return to Cairo.

295
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,100
-So this time I must go all the way.
-Them's the breaks.

296
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,900
You never believed in Hamunaptra.

297
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,000
Why are you going back?

298
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
You see that girl?

299
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
She saved my neck.

300
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,500
You always did have more balls
than brains.

301
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,600
Good-bye, Beni.

302
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,200
O'Connell!

303
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,500
"George Bembridge...

304
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,100
"...in 1860....

305
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,600
"ln 1865 with...."

306
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,000
For heaven's sake, girl,
it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

307
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,200
Where is the map?

308
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
There.

309
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,600
And the key? Where is the key?

310
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,400
The key? What key?

311
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,300
The map! We forgot the map!

312
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,100
Relax. I'm the map. It's all up here.

313
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,100
That's comforting.

314
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,800
-The key!
-Evy?

315
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,800
Hold on to this.

316
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,900
Can you swim?

317
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,100
-I can swim if the occasion calls for it.
-Trust me.

318
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,100
It calls for it.

319
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,800
O'Connell!

320
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,900
What are we going to do?

321
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,300
-Wait here! I'll go get help!
-Right!

322
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,300
Americans.

323
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,500
I say, bloody good show, chaps!

324
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,600
And did I panic?

325
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,500
I think not.

326
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,100
Get 'em out of the water!
Come on, dogies!

327
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,600
Give them a smack, would you!

328
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,700
This is a messed-up country.

329
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,200
We've lost everything!

330
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,600
All of our tools, all the equipment...

331
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,400
...all my clothes!

332
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,900
O'Connell!

333
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It looks to me like I've got all the horses!

334
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Beni!

335
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,300
It looks to me like you're
on the wrong side of the river!

336
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Yeah.

337
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,500
I only want four! Four!

338
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,900
I only want four, not a whole bloody herd!

339
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,900
Can you believe this cheat?

340
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,600
Just pay the man.

341
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,300
For heaven's sakes, can't believe the price
of these fleabags.

342
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,000
-Very good.
-You probably could've got them for free.

343
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,600
-You just had to give him your sister.
-Yes.

344
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,500
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

345
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,300
Awfully.

346
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,500
Never did like camels.

347
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,900
Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.

348
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,900
Disgusting.

349
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,000
I think they're adorable.

350
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
This one is strong.

351
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,100
Good morning, my friend.

352
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,600
What are we doing?

353
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,900
Patience, my good barat'm. Patience.

354
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Remember our bet, O'Connell?
First one to the city, $500 cash.

355
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,600
$100 is yours if you help us win that bet.

356
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,100
My pleasure.

357
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,200
O'Connell...

358
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,300
...nice camel.

359
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,100
Get ready for it.

360
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,200
For what?

361
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,600
We're about to be shown the way.

362
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,300
Will you look at that?

363
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,400
Can you believe it?

364
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,100
Hamunaptra.

365
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Here we go again.

366
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,500
So long, Beni!

367
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,700
That serves you right.

368
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,400
Go, Evy! Go!

369
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
Do they know something we don't?

370
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,900
They are led by a woman.

371
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,700
What does a woman know?

372
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,700
That's a statue of Anubis.

373
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,900
Its legs go deep underground.

374
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,600
According to Bembridge scholars,
we'll find a secret compartment there...

375
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,200
...containing the golden Book ofAmun-Ra.

376
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,400
Jonathan, you're meant
to catch the sun with that.

377
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,600
What are these old mirrors for?

378
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,600
Ancient mirrors.
It's an ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

379
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,700
Here, this is for you.

380
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Go ahead. It's something I borrowed
off our American brethren.

381
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,500
I thought you might like it.
You might need it...

382
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,100
...for when you're....

383
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What are you looking at?

384
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,300
Look for bugs.

385
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,000
I hate bugs.

386
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,400
We're standing inside a room
no one has entered in over 3,000 years.

387
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,100
What is that God-awful stench?

388
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,300
"And then there was...

389
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,900
"...light."

390
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,400
Hey, that is a neat trick.

391
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,300
-My God. It's a Sah-Net jer.
-What?

392
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,600
-Preparation room.
-For what?

393
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
For entering the afterlife.

394
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,200
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

395
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,400
What was that?

396
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,000
Sounds like...bugs.

397
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,900
He said bugs.

398
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,500
What do you mean, bugs? I hate bugs.

399
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,100
The legs of Anubis.

400
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,300
The secret compartment should be hidden
somewhere inside here.

401
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,800
You scared the bejesus out of us.

402
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,300
Likewise.

403
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,300
-That's my tool kit.
-I don't think so.

404
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,700
Okay.

405
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,000
Perhaps I was mistaken.

406
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,200
Have a nice day, gentlemen.
We have a lot of work to do.

407
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,000
-Push off! This is our dig site.
-We got here first.

408
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
This here's our statue, friend.

409
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,300
I don't see your name written on it, pal.

410
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,300
There's only four of you...

411
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,400
...and 15 of me.

412
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,300
Your odds are not so great.

413
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,300
-I've had worse.
-Me, too.

414
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,200
For goodness' sake, let's be nice, children.

415
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,800
If we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

416
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,000
There are other places to dig.

417
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,300
According to these hieroglyphics
we're underneath the statue.

418
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,400
We should come up between his legs.

419
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,200
When those damn Yanks go to sleep...

420
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,900
-...no offense...
-None taken.

421
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,400
...we'll dig up and steal the book
from under them.

422
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,000
Are you sure we can find
this secret compartment?

423
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,900
Yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

424
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,600
-No offense.
-None taken.

425
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,200
Where did our smelly little friend go to?

426
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,800
What have we here?

427
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,200
Blue gold.

428
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,700
This will fetch a mighty fine price.

429
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,500
-Let's get us some treasure!
-Careful!

430
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,200
Seti was no fool.

431
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,100
I think perhaps we should
let the diggers open it.

432
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,700
I think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

433
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,800
Yeah, sure. Let them open it.

434
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,200
So they ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars.

435
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,800
They'd take out your heart as well.
Know how they took out your brains?

436
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,700
We don't need to know this.

437
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,200
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose...

438
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,900
...scramble things about a bit
and then rip it out through your nostrils.

439
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
That must hurt.

440
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,500
It's mummification.
You're dead when they do it.

441
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,400
If I don't make it out of here,
don't put me down for mummification.

442
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,000
Likewise.

443
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, my God. It's a....

444
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,700
It's a sarcophagus.

445
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,700
Buried at the base of Anubis.

446
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,700
He must have been someone
of great importance.

447
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,700
Or he did something very naughty.

448
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,300
Allah.

449
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,100
One more.

450
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,200
Help me! Help me!

451
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,900
Who is it?

452
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,700
"He That Shall Not Be Named."

453
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,400
This looks like some sort of a lock.

454
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,900
-Whoever's in here sure wasn't getting out.
-No kidding.

455
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,300
It'll take a month to crack
into this thing without a key.

456
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,600
A key?

457
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,000
A key! That's what he was talking about!

458
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,800
-Who?
-The man on the barge.

459
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,200
The one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

460
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,000
That's mine.

461
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,000
-What do you suppose killed him?
-Did you ever see him eat?

462
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Seems that our American friends had
a little misfortune of their own today.

463
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,600
Three of their diggers were...melted.

464
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,500
-What?
-How?

465
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,500
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.

466
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,400
Some kind of ancient booby trap.

467
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,700
Maybe this place really is cursed.

468
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
For goodness' sake, you two!

469
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,900
-You don't believe in curses?
-No.

470
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,100
I believe if I can see it and touch it,
it's real. That's what I believe.

471
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,500
I believe in being prepared.

472
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,800
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

473
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,600
What is it?

474
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,400
A broken bottle.

475
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,400
Glenlivet. Twelve years old!

476
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,800
He may have been a stinky fellow,
but he had good taste.

477
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,100
Take this. Stay here.

478
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
-No, wait! Wait for me.
-Evy!

479
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,900
Excuse me, but didn't the man
just say "stay here"? Evy!

480
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,000
Mr. Henderson! Wake up!

481
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,400
Enough!

482
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,800
We will shed no more blood,
but you must leave.

483
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,700
Leave this place or die.

484
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,600
You have one day.

485
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,600
Evelyn.

486
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,500
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

487
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,000
-You sure?
-Thank you.

488
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,800
That proves it. Old Seti's fortune
has got to be under this sand.

489
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,900
For them to protect it like this,
there's got to be treasure down there.

490
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,200
These men are desert people.
They value water, not gold.

491
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,300
You know, maybe just at night
we could combine forces?

492
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,100
Tough stuff, try a right hook.

493
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,100
Ball up your fist and put it up like that.

494
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,900
Then mean it. Hit it here.

495
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,700
I mean it!

496
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,300
Okay, it's time for another drink.

497
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,900
Unlike my brother, sir...

498
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,000
...l know when to say no.

499
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,700
And unlike your brother, miss...

500
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,900
...you, I just don't get.

501
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I know.

502
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,100
You're wondering...

503
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,800
...what is a place like me
doing in a girl like this.

504
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah, something like that.

505
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,900
Egypt is in my blood.

506
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,600
You see, my father...

507
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,500
...was a very, very famous explorer.

508
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,300
He loved Egypt so much...

509
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,500
...he married my mother,
who was an Egyptian...

510
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,500
...and quite an adventurer herself.

511
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,000
I get your father, and I get your mother...

512
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,500
...and...

513
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,400
...l get him, but....

514
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,800
What are you doing here?

515
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,400
I may not be...

516
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,500
...an explorer...

517
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,600
...or an adventurer...

518
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,000
...or a treasure seeker, or a gunfighter...

519
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,300
...Mr. O'Connell...

520
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,300
...but I am proud of what I am.

521
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,000
And what is that?

522
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
I...

523
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,300
...am a librarian.

524
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,000
And I am going to kiss you...

525
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,500
...Mr. O'Connell.

526
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,100
Call me Rick.

527
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,900
Oh, Rick.

528
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,500
-There is a curse upon this chest.
-Curse, my ass.

529
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,100
-Who cares?
-Have a care, Mr. Henderson.

530
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,200
On these hallowed grounds,
that set forth in ancient times...

531
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,100
-...is as strong today as it was then.
-We understand.

532
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,700
What's it say?

533
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,600
"Death will come on swift wings...

534
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,300
"...to whomsoever opens this chest."

535
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,900
We should not be here.

536
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,200
This is not good.

537
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,700
It says, "There is one...

538
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,500
"...the undead...

539
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,800
"...who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law...

540
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,000
"...to consummate this curse."

541
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,700
Let's not bring anyone back
from the dead then.

542
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,500
"He will kill all who open this chest...

543
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,100
"...and assimilate their organs and fluids...

544
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,100
"...and in so doing, he will regenerate...

545
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,100
"...and no longer be the undead...

546
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,500
"...but a plague upon this earth."

547
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,600
Well, we didn't come all this way
for nothing.

548
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,700
-That's right.
-It's the curse.

549
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,900
It's the curse.

550
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,400
It's the curse! Beware of the curse!

551
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,300
Beware!

552
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Stupid superstitious bastard.

553
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,200
I've dreamt about this
since I was a little girl.

554
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,700
You dream about dead guys?

555
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,600
Look, the sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

556
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,400
This man must've been condemned
both in this life and the next.

557
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,700
-Tough break.
-Yeah, I'm all tears.

558
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,200
Now, let's see who's inside. Shall we?

559
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
I hate it when these things do that.

560
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,100
Is he supposed to look like that?

561
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,500
I've never seen a mummy
look like this before.

562
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,100
He's still....

563
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,300
-Juicy.
-Yes.

564
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,500
He must be more than 3,000 years old...

565
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,800
...and it looks as if he's still...

566
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,400
...decomposing.

567
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,400
Look at that.

568
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,300
What do you make of this?

569
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,700
These marks were made with...

570
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,300
...fingernails.

571
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,700
This man was buried alive.

572
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,300
And he left a message.

573
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,500
"Death is only the beginning."

574
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,100
Oh, my God.

575
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,600
It does exist.

576
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,800
-The Book of the Dead.
-A book?

577
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,100
Who cares about a book?
Where the hell's the treasure?

578
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,900
This, gentlemen...

579
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,100
...this is treasure.

580
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,300
I wouldn't trade you for a brass--

581
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,400
Look at that.

582
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,400
There's your treasure, gentlemen.

583
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,500
Now we're onto something.

584
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,400
I believe you need a key to open that book.

585
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,100
What do you think
these will fetch back home?

586
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,100
We hear you boys found yourselves a nice,
gooey mummy.

587
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,400
Congratulations.

588
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,400
If you dry that fella out,
you might be able to sell him for firewood.

589
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,500
Look what I found.

590
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,100
You're in her seat.

591
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,400
-Now!
-Yes.

592
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,900
Scarab skeletons, flesh-eaters.

593
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,300
I found them inside our friend's coffin.

594
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,200
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

595
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,500
Too bad for our friend, he was still alive
when they started eating him.

596
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,200
So somebody threw these in with our guy,
and then they slowly ate him alive?

597
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,800
Very slowly.

598
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,100
He sure wasn't a popular guy
when they planted him.

599
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,200
He probably got a little too frisky
with the Pharaoh's daughter.

600
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,600
According to my readings...

601
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,800
...our friend suffered the Hom-Dai,
the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses...

602
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,000
...one reserved only
for the most evil of blasphemers.

603
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,400
I've never heard of this curse
having actually been performed.

604
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,600
-That bad?
-Yes, well, they....

605
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,700
They never used it
because they feared it so.

606
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,900
It's written that if a victim
of the Hom-Dai should ever arise...

607
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,600
...he would bring with him
the ten plagues of Egypt.

608
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,700
That's called stealing, you know.

609
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,900
According to you and my brother...

610
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,900
...it's called borrowing.

611
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,900
I thought the Book ofAmun-Ra
was made out of gold.

612
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,400
It is made out of gold.
This isn't the Book ofAmun-Ra.

613
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,200
This is something else.

614
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,300
I think this may be the Book of the Dead.

615
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,600
The Book of the Dead?

616
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,900
Should you be playing around with it?

617
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,400
It's just a book. No harm ever came from...

618
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,000
...reading a book.

619
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,800
That happens a lot around here.

620
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,800
What's it say?

621
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,900
"Amun-Ra. Amun-Dei."

622
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,300
It speaks of the night and of the day.

623
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,700
No!

624
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,200
You must not read from the book!

625
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,200
Run!

626
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,100
Go, go!

627
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,400
What have we done?

628
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,600
Where'd they come from?

629
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,900
I ain't waiting around to find out.

630
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,600
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

631
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,600
Leave me! Leave me!

632
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,500
Could you help me find my--

633
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,700
Wait for me!

634
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,600
Who's there?

635
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,500
Who's there?

636
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,000
Daniels?

637
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,400
Scarabs!

638
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,700
-Run, Evy!
-Go, go! Run!

639
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,100
-Evelyn?
-Evy?

640
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,000
Mr. Burns. Thank goodness.

641
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,200
I was just starting to get scared.

642
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,400
I've lost everyone. I--

643
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,300
My eyes. My eyes.

644
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,700
Please help me.

645
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,000
He took my tongue.

646
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,300
Please don't leave me.

647
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,900
Anck-su-namun?

648
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,500
Damn it! It's a trapdoor.

649
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,200
There must be a switch
around here someplace.

650
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
Run, you sons of bitches! Run!

651
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,700
Go.

652
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,300
Go! Go!

653
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,900
Come with me
my Princess Anck-su-namun.

654
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,100
There you are! Stop playing hide-and-seek.

655
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,000
Let's get out of here.

656
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,700
Evy!

657
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,600
-Move!
-Did you see that?

658
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,000
It was walking. It was walking!

659
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I told you to leave or die. You refused.

660
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,200
Now you may have killed us all.

661
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,400
You have unleashed a creature
we have feared for 3,000 years.

662
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,000
-Relax. I got him.
-No mortal weapon can kill this creature.

663
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,100
He's not of this world.

664
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,500
-You bastards.
-What did you do to him?

665
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,500
We saved him before the creature
could finish his work.

666
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,300
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

667
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,800
We must now hunt him
and find a way to kill him.

668
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,500
I already told you I got him.

669
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,600
Know this.

670
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,700
This creature is the bringer of death.

671
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,500
He will never eat, he will never sleep...

672
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,800
...and he will never stop.

673
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,700
May the good Lord protect
and watch over me...

674
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,800
...as a shepherd watches over his flock.

675
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,400
No? Okay.

676
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,600
The language of the slaves...

677
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,000
...l may have use for you.

678
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,900
And the rewards...

679
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,800
...will be great.

680
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,000
My prince.

681
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,900
Where are the other sacred jars?

682
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,300
FORT BRYDON, CAIRO

683
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,300
I thought you said
you didn't believe in fairy tales.

684
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,000
Encountering a 3,000-year-old walking,
talking corpse...

685
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,600
...tends to convert one.

686
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,800
Forget it. We're out the door,
down the hall and we're gone.

687
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:07,100
-No, we are not.
-Yes, we are.

688
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,700
No. We woke him up,
and we are going to stop him.

689
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,800
What "we"? "We" didn't read that book.

690
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,600
I told you not to play around
with that thing. Didn't l?

691
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,800
Yes, then me. I woke him up
and I intend to stop him.

692
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,100
How? You heard the man.
No mortal weapons can kill this guy.

693
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,300
Then we are just going to have
to find some immortal ones.

694
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,300
-There goes that "we" again.
-Will you listen to me? We have to do--

695
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,700
Once this creature is reborn his curse
will spread till the earth is destroyed.

696
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,700
-Is that my problem?
-It is everybody's problem.

697
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,900
I appreciate you saving my life
but when I signed on...

698
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,700
...l agreed to take you out there
and to bring you back.

699
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I've done that. End of job. End of story.

700
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,400
-Contract terminated.
-That's all I mean to you?

701
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,300
You can either tag along with me...

702
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,500
...or you can stay here
and try and save the world!

703
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
-What's it gonna be?
-I'm staying.

704
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,500
-Fine!
-Fine.

705
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,100
I'm the last of the Royal Air Force
still stationed out here, you know.

706
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,200
Some bloody idiot spilled his drink.

707
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,000
All the other laddies died in the sky
and were buried in the sand.

708
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,800
Good chaps, every one of them, too.

709
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,500
Hi, Winston.

710
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
You know, O'Connell...

711
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,100
...ever since the end of the Great War,
there hasn't been a single challenge...

712
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,700
...worthy of a man like me.

713
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,300
Yeah? We all got
our little problems today.

714
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,500
I just wish I could have chucked it in
with the others...

715
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,000
...and gone down in flame and glory...

716
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,300
...instead of sitting around here
rotting of boredom and booze.

717
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,700
Cheers.

718
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,200
Back to the airfield.

719
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,200
-Has your sister always been--
-Yes, always.

720
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,200
We're all packed,
but the boat doesn't leave till tomorrow.

721
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,700
Tail set firmly between your legs, I see.

722
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,400
You don't have a sacred walking corpse
after you.

723
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,000
How's your friend?

724
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,900
He had his eyes and his tongue ripped out.
How would you be?

725
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,200
I'm so pleased...

726
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,400
...to meet you.

727
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,600
Prince lmhotep does not like to be touched.

728
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,600
A silly Eastern superstition, I'm afraid.

729
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,400
Please forgive me.

730
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,200
Mr. Burns...

731
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,300
...Prince lmhotep thanks you
for your hospitality.

732
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,500
And for your eyes.

733
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,400
And for your tongue.

734
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,900
But I am afraid more is needed.

735
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,000
The Prince must finish the job...

736
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,700
...and consummate the curse
which you and your friends...

737
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,500
-...have brought down upon yourselves.
-Wait! No!

738
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,900
Good luck, boys.

739
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,500
Sweet Jesus! Tasted just like....

740
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,300
Blood.

741
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,400
"And the rivers and waters
of Egypt ran red...

742
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,400
"...and were as blood."

743
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,800
He's here.

744
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,500
-Evelyn!
-So you're still here.

745
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,900
We've got problems.

746
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,200
Beni, you little stinkweed.
Where you been?

747
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,500
We are in serious trouble.

748
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,200
You saved me from the undead.

749
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,700
I thank you.

750
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,500
We are in very serious trouble.

751
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,200
-He seems to like Evy.
-What's that about?

752
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,900
-What's this guy want?
-Only one person can give us any answers.

753
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,500
-You!
-Miss Carnahan.

754
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,200
-Gentlemen.
-What is he doing here?

755
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,600
Do you really want to know,
or would you prefer to just shoot us?

756
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,500
After what I just saw...

757
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,800
...l'm willing to go on faith.

758
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,500
We are part of an ancient secret society.

759
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,900
For over 3,000 years
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

760
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,000
We are sworn at manhood to do all to stop
the High Priest lmhotep from being reborn.

761
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,900
Because of you, we have failed.

762
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,500
Does this justify killing innocent people?

763
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,400
To stop this creature? Let me think. Yes!

764
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,000
Question: Why doesn't he like cats?

765
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:02,400
They're guardians of the underworld.
He'll fear them till he's fully regenerated.

766
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,400
-Then he will fear nothing.
-You know how he regenerates?

767
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,500
-By killing everyone who opened the chest.
-And sucking them dry!

768
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,800
Stop playing with that.

769
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,900
When I saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-su-namun.

770
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,100
And now, in Mr. Burns' quarters,
he tried to kiss me.

771
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,300
It's because of his love for Anck-su-namun
that he was cursed.

772
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,100
-Even after 3,000 years--
-He's still in love with her.

773
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,800
That's very romantic,
but what's it got to do with me?

774
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,200
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

775
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,500
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.

776
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,100
Bad luck, old mum.

777
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,500
On the contrary, it may just give us
the time we need to kill the creature.

778
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:52,500
We will need all the help we can get.
His powers are growing.

779
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,500
"And he stretched forth
his hand towards the heavens...

780
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,900
"...and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt."

781
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,100
We must stop him from regenerating.

782
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,700
-Who opened that chest?
-Me and Daniels.

783
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,300
-And Burns.
-And that Egyptologist.

784
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,800
-What about my buddy Beni?
-He scrammed before we opened it.

785
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,900
-Yeah, he was the smart one.
-That sounds like Beni.

786
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,200
We must find the Egyptologist
and return him to safety...

787
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,600
-...before the creature can get to him.
-Right.

788
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,900
-She stays here. You three, come with me.
-Not me!

789
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,800
You can't leave me behind
like some old carpetbag.

790
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,600
Who put you in charge?
What do you think you are doing?

791
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,200
-Jonathan! O'Connell!
-Sorry, but he's a bit...tall.

792
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,400
You are not leaving me in here!

793
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,000
If you don't open this door
in one minute flat....

794
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,300
This door doesn't open.

795
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,200
-She doesn't come out, and no one goes in.
-Right.

796
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,300
-Right?
-Right.

797
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,800
O'Connell! Jonathan!

798
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Let's go.

799
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,100
I thought I could stay at the fort
and reconnoiter.

800
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,800
-Now!
-We're just gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

801
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,900
Let me guess...spring cleaning?

802
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,200
Nice shot.

803
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,000
Beni, did you fall down?
Let me help you up.

804
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,100
You came back from the desert
with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

805
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,500
What friend? You are my only friend.

806
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,800
What the hell are you doing
with this creep? What's in it for you?

807
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:10,000
It is better to be the right hand
of the devil than to be in his path.

808
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,600
As long as I serve him, I am immune.

809
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,600
Immune from what?

810
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,600
-What did you say?
-I don't wanna tell you. You'll hurt me.

811
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,200
What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

812
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,600
The black book they found at Hamunaptra.
He wants it back.

813
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,100
He said it would be worth its weight
in gold.

814
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,900
-What does he want the book for?
-I don't know.

815
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,700
Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

816
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,300
But that's all.
He just wants the book, I swear.

817
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,500
Just the book, I swear. And your sister.

818
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,600
But other than that--

819
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,700
That's two down, two to go.

820
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,700
Then he'll be coming after Evy.

821
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,900
Guards in place! Reporting all clear, sir!

822
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,000
To hell with this.

823
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm going downstairs to get a drink.
You want something?

824
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,500
-Get me a glass of bourbon.
-All right.

825
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,800
-And a shot of bourbon.
-Yeah, okay.

826
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,400
-And a bourbon chaser.
-I'll get your damn bourbon!

827
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,600
Don't worry about the door.

828
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,100
Anck-su-namun.

829
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,100
Get your ugly face off of her!

830
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,300
Look what I got.

831
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,600
You all right?

832
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:21,900
I'm not sure.

833
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,100
According to legend, the black book
found by the Americans at Hamunaptra...

834
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,000
...can bring people back from the dead.

835
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,700
-Until now I did not believe it.
-Believe it.

836
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
That's what brought our buddy back to life.

837
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,300
If the black book can bring dead people
to life....

838
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,100
-Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
-That's the myth.

839
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,200
Now we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

840
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,900
Imhotep. Imhotep.

841
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,400
Last but not least, my favorite plague...
boils and sores.

842
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,900
They have become his slaves.

843
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,900
So it has begun, the beginning of the end.

844
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,700
Not quite yet. Come on.

845
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,900
Bembridge scholars said
the golden Book ofAmun-Ra...

846
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,700
...was inside the statue of Anubis.

847
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,000
-That's where we found the black book.
-Exactly.

848
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,600
-The old boys at Bembridge were wrong.
-They mixed the books up.

849
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,400
Mixed up where they were buried.

850
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,500
So if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis...

851
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,100
...then the golden book must be inside....

852
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,800
-Come on, Evy. Faster.
-Patience is a virtue.

853
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,100
Not right now it isn't.

854
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,400
I think I'll go and get the car started.

855
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,100
I've got it. The Book ofAmun-Ra is at...

856
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,700
...Hamunaptra inside the statue of Horus.

857
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,200
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

858
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,700
Imhotep.

859
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,400
Let's go, let's go!

860
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,500
-Get it in gear.
-Let's get out of here.

861
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,000
-Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
-Imhotep!

862
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,500
You're gonna get yours, Beni!
You hear me?

863
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:27,200
-You're gonna get yours!
-Like I've never heard that before!

864
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,100
Hang on!

865
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,400
Okay! Go, go!

866
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,600
Imhotep. Imhotep.

867
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,200
It's the creature.

868
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,000
He's fully regenerated.

869
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,100
"Come with me, my princess.

870
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,200
"lt is time to make you mine forever."

871
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,200
"For all eternity," idiot.

872
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,600
"Take my hand...

873
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,900
"...and I will spare your friends."

874
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,100
Oh, dear.

875
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:33,300
-Have you got any bright ideas?
-I'm thinking.

876
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:36,600
You better think fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy...

877
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,200
...you're the first one I'm coming after.

878
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,600
-No.
-Don't!

879
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,800
He must take me to Hamunaptra
to perform the ritual.

880
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
She is right. Live today, fight tomorrow.

881
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,100
I'll be seeing you again.

882
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,100
Evelyn!

883
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,500
That's mine.

884
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,100
Thank you.

885
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,700
Kill them all!

886
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,500
No! Let go of me!

887
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,500
Let go of me!

888
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,400
Good-bye, my friend.

889
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,200
Come here, you little....

890
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,900
Come on!

891
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:42,400
-What about my sister?
-We're gonna get her back! Go!

892
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,100
You're next!

893
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,600
Come on! Give me your hand!

894
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:26,500
'Morning, Winston. A word?

895
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:31,900
What's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

896
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,700
Not a damn thing.

897
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,000
-Is it dangerous?
-You might not live through it.

898
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,000
By Jove, do you really think so?

899
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,100
Everybody else we've run into has died.
Why not you?

900
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,200
What's the challenge then?

901
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:49,000
Rescue the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy and save the world.

902
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:53,100
Winston Havelock at your service, sir.

903
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,200
Are you all right?

904
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,400
Do I bloody look all right?

905
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,200
How you doing?

906
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,600
You see that? I've never seen one so big.

907
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,000
-Never?
-No!

908
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:47,000
Get off of me! Get off!

909
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,700
I need a new job.

910
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:12,600
My God.

911
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,000
We're back.

912
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:29,000
O'Connell.

913
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,500
My God.

914
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,400
Winston!

915
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,100
Paddle faster.

916
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,300
Hang on, men!

917
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,100
Stop it! You'll kill them!

918
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,900
That's the idea.

919
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,200
Here I come, laddies!

920
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,500
I loved the whole sand-wall trick.
It was beautiful.

921
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,700
Bastard.

922
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,400
Excuse me.

923
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:56,300
A little help would be useful,
if it's not too much trouble!

924
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,600
Yeah. All right.

925
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,000
Winston!

926
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,900
Quicksand! Get back! It's quicksand.

927
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,700
Keep moving!

928
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:21,200
Nasty little fellows such as yourself
always get their comeuppance.

929
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:25,300
-They do?
-Yes.

930
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,000
Always.

931
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:37,100
Take those bigger stones first.

932
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,800
Take them from the top,
or everything will cave in on us.

933
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,200
Come on. Put your backs into it.

934
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,900
You've got the idea. Chop-chop.

935
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,900
I say!

936
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:04,100
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

937
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,300
What?

938
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,000
It's in my arm! My arm!

939
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,500
Hold him!

940
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,500
Do something! Do something!
Not that! Not that!

941
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,300
O'Connell.

942
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,000
The Bembridge scholars
never wrote about this.

943
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,500
Let go of me.

944
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,200
Kill them...

945
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,300
...and wake the others.

946
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,400
-Can you see....
-Yeah.

947
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,500
-Can you believe....
-Yeah.

948
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,800
-Can we just....
-No.

949
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,400
-Who the hell are these guys?
-Priests.

950
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,100
Imhotep's priests.

951
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,800
All right then.

952
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,100
There he is!

953
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,900
Hello, Horus, old boy.

954
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,600
Time to close the door.

955
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,200
Anck-su-namun.

956
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:43,400
O'Connell! Jonathan!

957
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,800
Damn, these guys just don't quit, do they?

958
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,500
Keep digging.

959
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,200
The Book ofAmun-Ra.

960
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,000
Save the girl.

961
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,800
Kill the creature.

962
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,100
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

963
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,400
You all right? Let's go.

964
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:54,500
With your death, Anck-su-namun shall live.

965
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,700
And I shall be invincible!

966
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,500
The Book ofAmun-Ra! I found it, Evy!

967
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,800
The Book ofAmun-Ra.

968
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,900
Shut up and get me off here, Jonathan!

969
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:09,400
Open the book.
It's the only way to kill him.

970
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:13,100
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

971
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:16,100
I can't open it! It's locked.

972
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,400
-We need the key, Evy!
-It's inside his robes.

973
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Mummies.

974
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,100
Look out! There's one....

975
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:45,100
Here's an inscription.

976
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,600
This keeps getting better and better.

977
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,800
-Do something.
-Me?

978
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,900
-You can command them.
-You have got to be joking.

979
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:26,000
Finish the inscription on the cover, idiot,
then you can control them.

980
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Right.

981
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:07,000
Hurry up, Jonathan!

982
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,400
-I can't figure out this last symbol.
-What does it look like?

983
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,000
It's a bird, a stork!

984
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,400
Ahmenophus!

985
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,900
Yes, I see.

986
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:50,700
Destroy him!

987
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,000
I command you to destroy him!

988
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,700
Anck-su-namun!

989
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,800
Give me that book!

990
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,400
Now you die.

991
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,800
Evy! I've got it.

992
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:54,700
Keep him busy.

993
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,900
No problem.

994
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:13,300
Hurry, Evy!

995
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:15,500
-Hurry!
-You're not helping.

996
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,400
Now it's your turn.

997
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,200
I've got it.

998
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,200
I thought you said it was gonna kill him!

999
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,900
He's mortal.

1000
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,400
"Death...

1001
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,100
"...is only the beginning."

1002
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,000
Time to go.

1003
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,500
You've lost the book!

1004
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:34,800
-I can't believe--
-Come on!

1005
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,900
-Couldn't we just--
-No, Jonathan!

1006
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:14,200
O'Connell!

1007
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,500
-Wait!
-Come on, give me your hand.

1008
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,800
Good-bye, Beni.

1009
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:06,100
Go away.

1010
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,400
Thank you very much.

1011
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:33,500
You've earned the respect and gratitude
of me and my people.

1012
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:36,800
It was nothing.

1013
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,200
May Allah smile upon you always.

1014
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:42,900
And...yourself.

1015
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:50,700
Yes, anytime.

1016
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,000
Stay out of trouble.

1017
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,900
He's just leaving us here.

1018
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,200
I guess we go home empty-handed again.

1019
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,500
I wouldn't say that.

1020
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,300
Please!

1021
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,300
How about you, darling?
Would you like a little kissy-wissy?

1022
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:52,700
