1
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:11,669
Thebes, City of the Living...

2
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:14,464
crown jewel
of Pharaoh Seti the First...

3
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:21,638
home of Imhotep,
Pharaoh's high priest...

4
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:23,640
keeper of the dead...

5
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:29,312
birthplace of Anck-su-namun,
Pharaoh's mistress.

6
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:32,315
No other man
was allowed to touch her.

7
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:59,133
But for their love,
they were willing to risk life itself.

8
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,953
To resurrect Anck-su-namun...

9
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:54,290
Imhotep and his priests
broke into her crypt and stole her body.

10
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,626
They raced deep into the desert...

11
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,964
taking Anck-su-namun's corpse
to Hamunaptra, City of the Dead...

12
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:04,092
ancient burial site
for the sons of pharaohs...

13
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:07,095
and resting place
for the wealth of Egypt.

14
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:15,144
For his love, Imhotep dared the gods'
anger by going deep into the city...

15
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:19,190
where he took the black Book of the Dead
from its holy resting place.

16
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:24,904
Anck-su-namun's soul had been sent
to the dark underworld...

17
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:30,076
her vital organs removed and placed
in five sacred canopic jars.

18
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:02,233
Anck-su-namun's soul
had come back from the dead.

19
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:07,322
But Pharaoh's bodyguards
had followed Imhotep and stopped him...

20
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,866
before the ritual
could be completed.

21
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:26,132
Imhotep's priests were condemned
to be mummified alive.

22
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,521
As for Imhotep...

23
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:42,190
he was condemned to endure
the Hom-Dai...

24
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:44,901
the worst
of all ancient curses...

25
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:48,404
one so horrible
it had never before been bestowed.

26
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:31,489
He was to remain sealed
inside his sarcophagus--

27
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:34,492
the undead
for all of eternity.

28
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:37,495
The Magi would never
allow him to be released...

29
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,624
for he would arise a walking disease,
a plague upon mankind...

30
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,961
an unholy flesh eater
with the strength of ages...

31
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,963
power over the sands...

32
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,632
and the glory
of invincibility.

33
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:26,211
For 3,000 years,
men and armies fought over this land...

34
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,963
never knowing
what evil lay beneath it.

35
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:47,357
And for 3,000 years...

36
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,071
we, the Magi, the descendants of
Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards, kept watch.

37
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,920
You just got promoted.

38
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,714
Prenez vos positions!

39
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:17,595
Steady!

40
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,597
You're with me
on this one, right?

41
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:21,891
Oh. Your strength
gives me strength.

42
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,686
Steady!

43
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:31,609
Wait! Wait for me!

44
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,070
Steady!

45
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,618
Fire!

46
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,965
Aaah!

47
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,928
Aaah!

48
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:03,391
Aaah!

49
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,419
Aaaah!

50
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,313
Aaaaah!

51
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:07,038
Run, Beni! Run!

52
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:10,542
Get inside!
Get inside!

53
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:15,672
Hey! Don't you close that door!

54
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:18,216
Don't you close that door!

55
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,009
Aah! Aah!

56
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:36,401
Aah!

57
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,522
"Sacred Stones."

58
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:41,401
"Sculpture and Aesthetics."

59
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:46,406
Socrates, Seth,
volume one, volume two...

60
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:49,117
and volume three.

61
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,536
And T--

62
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:55,832
Tuthmosis?
What are you doing here?

63
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:57,876
"T."
"T," "T," "T," "T."

64
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,627
"T."

65
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:03,298
I'm going
to put you where you belong.

66
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:10,388
Ohh!

67
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,893
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

68
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:22,984
Help. Ooh.

69
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,861
Ohh!

70
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:27,572
Ohhh! Ohhh!

71
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:29,741
Whoa-a-aaah!

72
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:51,262
Oops.

73
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,765
What--
How c-- I--

74
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:58,895
H-How--

75
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:01,523
Oh, look at this!

76
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,609
Sons of the pharaohs!

77
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:08,738
Give me frogs!
Flies! Locusts!

78
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:10,740
Anything but you!

79
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:13,743
Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

80
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:16,913
I am so very sorry.
It was an accident.

81
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:21,751
My girl, when Rameses destroyed Syria,
that was an accident.

82
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,920
You...
are a catastrophe!

83
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:26,381
Look at my library!

84
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,133
Why do I put up with you?

85
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:32,220
W-Well, you put up with me
because I can--

86
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:35,306
I can read and write
ancient Egyptian...

87
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:38,560
and I can-- I can decipher
hieroglyphics and hieratic...

88
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:42,272
and, w-well, I am the only person
within a thousand miles...

89
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:45,817
who knows how to properly code
and catalog this library, that's why.

90
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,487
I put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

91
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:51,489
That's why!

92
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,992
Allah rest their souls.

93
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:58,580
Now, I don't care how you do it,
I don't care how long it takes.

94
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:01,124
Straighten up
this meshiver!

95
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:15,930
Hello?

96
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,625
Abdul?

97
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:47,170
Mohammed?

98
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:51,466
Bob?

99
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:13,988
Have you no respect
for the dead?

100
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:18,201
Of course I do!

101
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:20,828
But sometimes
I'd rather like to join them.

102
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:25,041
Well, I wish you would do it
before you ruin my career
the way you've ruined yours.

103
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:26,709
Now get out!

104
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:28,711
My dear, sweet
baby sister...

105
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,713
I'll have you... know...

106
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:34,050
that at this precise moment
my career is on a high note.

107
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:37,554
"High note." Ha! Jonathan, please,
I'm really not in the mood for you.

108
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:40,557
I've just made a bit of a mess
in the library...

109
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,560
and the Bembridge scholars have
rejected my application form again.

110
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:46,563
They say I don't have
enough experience in the field.

111
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,278
You'll always have me,
old mum.

112
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:59,450
Besides, I have just the thing
to cheer you up.

113
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:02,954
Oh, no, Jonathan,
not another worthless trinket.

114
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:06,082
If I have to take one more piece
of junk to the curator to try and...

115
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,126
sell for you--

116
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,797
Where did you get this?

117
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:16,551
On a dig down in Thebes.

118
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,720
My whole life I've never
found anything, Evy.

119
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,723
Please tell me
I've found something.

120
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,394
Jonathan.

121
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,730
Yes?

122
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,899
I think you've found something.

123
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,446
You see the cartouche there.

124
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:39,991
It's the official royal seal
of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.

125
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:41,993
- Perhaps.
- Two questions.

126
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:44,996
Who the hell was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

127
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:47,081
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty...

128
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:49,167
said to be the wealthiest pharaoh
of them all.

129
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,169
Good. I like this fellow.

130
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:53,296
- I like him very much.
- I've already dated the map.

131
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:55,340
It's almost 3,000 years old.

132
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:57,634
And if you look at
the hieratic just here...

133
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,636
well, it's Hamunaptra.

134
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:02,472
Dear God,
don't be ridiculous.

135
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:04,933
We're scholars,
not treasure hunters.

136
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:07,936
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers...

137
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:09,938
to amuse Greek
and Roman tourists.

138
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:13,816
I know all the blather
about the city being protected
by the curse of a mummy...

139
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,861
but my research
has led me to believe...

140
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,280
that the city itself
may have actually existed.

141
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,366
Are we talking about
the Hamunaptra?

142
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,368
Yes. The City of the Dead.

143
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:26,538
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.

144
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:29,374
Yes, yes, i-i-in a big,
underground treasure chamber.

145
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:32,669
- Heh!
- Oh, come on.
Everybody knows the story.

146
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:36,172
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command.

147
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:40,051
The whole place would disappear
beneath the sand dunes,
taking the treasure with it.

148
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:43,388
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum--

149
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:45,890
Oh, my goodness!
Look at that!

150
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,733
You've burnt it! You've burned off
the part with the lost city.

151
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,735
It's for the best,
I'm sure.

152
00:18:57,861 --> 00:18:59,737
Many men
have wasted their lives...

153
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:02,115
in the foolish pursuit
of Hamunaptra.

154
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,701
No one's ever found it.

155
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:07,370
Most...
have never returned.

156
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:10,206
Come, come!
Step over the threshold.

157
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,750
Welcome to Cairo Prison,
my humble home.

158
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:15,753
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

159
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,755
- Well, I was mistaken.
- You lied.

160
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,258
I lie to everybody.
What makes you so special?

161
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,719
- I am your sister.
- That just makes you more gullible.

162
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:25,638
- You stole it from a drunk
at the local casbah.
- Picked his pocket, actually.

163
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:28,558
- So I don't think it's a very good--
- Stop being so ridiculous.

164
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:31,686
- What exactly is this man in prison for?
- This I do not know.

165
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:34,731
But when I heard that you were coming,
I asked him that myself.

166
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:36,733
And what did he say?

167
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:40,069
He said he was just looking
for a good time.

168
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,369
- This is the man
that you stole it from?
- Yes, exactly.

169
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,581
- So why don't we just go
sniff out a spot of tiffin--
- Who are you?

170
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,293
- And who's the broad?
- "Broad"?

171
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:59,547
I-I'm just a local sort
of missionary chap,
spreading the good word.

172
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,258
- But this is my sister Evy.
- How do you do?

173
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:06,137
- Oh, well.
Guess she's not a total loss.
- I beg your pardon.

174
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:08,598
I'll be back in a moment.

175
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,600
Ask him about the box.

176
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:14,437
Um, we have found--
Uh, hello. Excuse me.

177
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:17,106
We both found
your puzzle box...

178
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,817
and we've come
to ask you about it.

179
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:22,820
- No.
- No.

180
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:25,949
No. You came to ask me
about Hamunaptra.

181
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:30,078
- Shh. Shh.
- H-How do you know the box
pertains to Hamunaptra?

182
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:33,581
Because that's where I was
when I found it. I was there.

183
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,584
But how do we know
that's not a load of pig's wallow?

184
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,294
Do I know you?

185
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,838
No, no. I've just got
one of those faces.

186
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:49,806
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

187
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:52,141
Yeah, I was there.

188
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:54,310
- You swear?
- Every damn day.

189
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:56,312
- I didn't mean that--
- I know. I was there.

190
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:58,815
Seti's place.
City of the Dead.

191
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:01,860
Could you tell me how to get there?

192
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:08,157
I mean, the exact location.

193
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,869
- You want to know?
- W-Well, yes.

194
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:13,371
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

195
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,210
Then get me
the hell out of here!

196
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,631
Do it, lady!

197
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,138
Where are they taking him?

198
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,140
To be hanged.

199
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:35,351
Apparently he had
a very good time.

200
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:42,358
I will give you 100 pounds
to save this man's life.

201
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:46,362
Madame, I would pay 100 pounds
just to see him hang.

202
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:48,031
- Two hundred pounds!
- Proceed!

203
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:50,909
Three hundred pounds!

204
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:53,161
Any last requests, pig?

205
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:56,164
Yeah. Loosen the knot
and let me go.

206
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:02,170
Yahemar!
Of course we don't let him go!

207
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,424
- Five hundred pounds!
- [ Shouts In Arabic ]

208
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:09,093
And what else?

209
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:11,179
I'm a very lonely man.

210
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:16,351
- Yalla tlak!
- No!

211
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:25,860
Ha ha!
His neck did not break!

212
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:32,408
Oh, I'm so sorry. Now we must
watch him strangle to death.

213
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,919
He knows the location
to Hamunaptra.

214
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,256
- You lie.
- I would never!

215
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:50,927
Are you telling me this filthy,
godless son of a pig knows where
to find the City of the Dead?

216
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,929
- Yes!
- Truly?

217
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:56,099
Yes! And if you cut him down,
we will give you--

218
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:00,770
- Ten percent.
- Fifty percent.

219
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:01,980
- Twenty.
- Forty.

220
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,982
- Thirty!
- Twenty-five.

221
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:05,400
Ah! Deal.

222
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,945
Ahh! Cut him down!

223
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,630
Do you really think
he's going to show up?

224
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:29,632
Yes, undoubtedly,
knowing my luck.

225
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:33,136
He may be a cowboy, but I know
the breed. His word is his word.

226
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:37,140
Well, personally I think he's filthy,
rude, a complete scoundrel.

227
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:39,684
- I don't like him one bit.
- Anyone I know?

228
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,147
Oh.

229
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:46,608
Um, hello.

230
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,861
Smashing day for the start
of an adventure, eh, O'Connell?

231
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:52,197
Yeah. Yeah, smashing.

232
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:55,533
Oh, no, no, I'd never steal
from a partner... partner.

233
00:23:56,826 --> 00:24:00,288
That reminds me.
No hard feelings about the--

234
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:03,208
- Oh, no, no. Happens all the time.
- Mr.O'Connell.

235
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:07,587
Can you look me in the eye
and guarantee me this isn't
some kind of a flimflam?

236
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,341
- Because if it is, I am warning you--
- You're warning me?

237
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:15,470
Lady, let me put it this way:
My whole damn garrison
believed in this so much...

238
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:19,307
that without orders,
they marched halfway across Libya
and into Egypt to find that city.

239
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,684
When we got there,
all we found...

240
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:23,895
was sand and blood.

241
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,147
Let me get your bags.

242
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,363
Yes, yes, you're right.

243
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:37,033
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

244
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:41,204
Bright good morning to all.

245
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,039
Oh, no.
What are you doing here?

246
00:24:43,164 --> 00:24:47,085
I'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

247
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:11,526
Quit playin' with
your glasses and cut the deck, Burns.

248
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,529
Without my glasses
I can't see the deck to cut it, Dave.

249
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,448
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

250
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:20,535
- I only gamble with
my life, never my money.
- Never?

251
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,247
What if I was to bet you $500
we get to Hamunaptra before you?

252
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:28,209
- You're looking for Hamunaptra?
- Damn straight we are.

253
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,253
- And who says we are?
- [ All Three ] He does.

254
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:32,797
- Well--
- Well, how 'bout it?

255
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:35,717
Is it a bet?

256
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,971
- All right, you're on.
- What makes you so confident, sir?

257
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,266
- What makes you?
- We got us a man
who's actually been there.

258
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:45,310
Oh, what a coincidence,
because O'Connell--

259
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:47,312
Whose play is it?

260
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:49,522
Is it-- Is it my play?
I thought--

261
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:51,941
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

262
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:53,985
- Good night.

263
00:26:10,126 --> 00:26:12,128
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare ya.

264
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:15,256
The only thing that scares me,
Mr.O'Connell, are your manners.

265
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,342
Still angry about that kiss, huh?

266
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:20,094
Well, if you call that a kiss.

267
00:26:24,474 --> 00:26:27,560
Um, did I miss something?

268
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,772
Are we--
Are we going into battle?

269
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,274
Lady, there's something
out there.

270
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,360
Something underneath that sand.

271
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:38,696
Yes, well, I'm hoping to find
a certain artifact.

272
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,698
A book, actually.

273
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:42,700
My brother
thinks there's treasure.

274
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:46,287
- What do you think's out there?
- In a word? Evil.

275
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:49,958
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed.

276
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,836
Oh, look, I don't believe in fairy tales
and hokum, Mr.O'Connell...

277
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:57,173
but I do believe one of the most famous
books in history is buried there.

278
00:26:57,257 --> 00:26:59,175
The Book of Amun-Ra.

279
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:02,887
It contains within it all the secret
incantations of the old kingdom.

280
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,890
It's what first interested me in Egypt
when I was a child.

281
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:09,394
It's why I came here--
sort of a life's pursuit.

282
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,690
And the fact that they say it's made out
of pure gold makes no never mind to you?

283
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:16,025
- Right?
- You know your history.

284
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,069
I know my treasure.

285
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:23,074
Um... by the way...

286
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,077
why did you kiss me?

287
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:28,913
I was about to be hanged.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

288
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,707
Ohh!

289
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:36,713
What?
What'd I say?

290
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,429
Aaah! Aah!
Surprise!

291
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,389
My good friend,
you're alive!

292
00:27:46,472 --> 00:27:48,391
I was so very,
very worried.

293
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:51,561
Well, if it ain't
my little buddy Beni.

294
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:53,771
- I think I'll kill you.
- Think of my children.

295
00:27:53,897 --> 00:27:55,565
You don't have any children.

296
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,942
- Someday I might.
- Shut up!

297
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:01,487
So you're the one who's leading
the Americans. I might have known.

298
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:05,867
So what's the scam?
You take them into the desert,
and then you leave 'em to rot?

299
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,869
Unfortunately, no.

300
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,871
These Americans are smart.

301
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,208
They pay me only half now,
half when I get them back to Cairo.

302
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,544
- So this time I must go all the way.
- Them's the breaks, huh?

303
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:20,965
You never believed
in Hamunaptra, O'Connell.

304
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,968
- Why are you going back?

305
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,054
You see that girl?

306
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,139
She saved my neck.

307
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:35,772
You always did have
more balls than brains.

308
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,070
Yeah.

309
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,571
Good-bye, Beni.

310
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,073
Yaaaaah!

311
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:52,163
O'Connell!

312
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,343
"George Bembridge...

313
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:08,930
in eighteen-sixty--"

314
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:14,310
Hmm. "1865 was--

315
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,523
was--"

316
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:22,527
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl,
it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

317
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:39,127
Where is the map?

318
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,171
It's--
It's... there.

319
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:45,550
And the key?
Where is the key?

320
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:48,344
The key? The key?
What key?

321
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:50,388
Evelyn!

322
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,686
Aaah!

323
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:01,566
Aaaah!

324
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:07,363
The map!
The map! I forgot the map!

325
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:09,991
Relax. I'm the map.
It's all up here.

326
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,993
Oh, that's comforting.

327
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:22,545
- The key!
- Evy?

328
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,776
Hold on to this.

329
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:47,362
Ohh!

330
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:54,410
- Ohh! Aah!

331
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:57,247
Ohh!

332
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:15,598
Can you swim?

333
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:18,935
- Of course I can swim,
if the occasion calls for it.
- Trust me.

334
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:20,270
It calls for it.

335
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,986
- Yaaaah!

336
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,836
- O'Connell! O'Connell!

337
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:47,130
What are we going to do?

338
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:49,424
- Wait here! I'll go get help!
- Right!

339
00:31:57,724 --> 00:32:00,268
Aaah!

340
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:13,698
Americans.

341
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:15,658
Aaaah!

342
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,841
I say, bloody good show, chaps!

343
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,843
And did I panic?

344
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,887
I think not.

345
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:38,223
Yaaah!

346
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:41,226
- Get out of here!

347
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:51,736
Get 'em out of the water!
Come on, dogies!

348
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:53,738
Give 'em a smack, would ya!

349
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,618
This is a messed-up country.

350
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:03,414
- We've lost everything!

351
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,875
All of our tools,
all the equipment!

352
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,585
All my clothes!

353
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,754
O'Connell!

354
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:11,422
Hey!

355
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:13,508
O'Connell!

356
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:17,887
It looks to me
like I've got all the horses!

357
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:19,681
Hey, Beni!

358
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:23,768
Looks to me like you're on
the wrong side of the river!

359
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:26,437
Yeah.

360
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:44,789
I only want four! Four!

361
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:48,293
- I only want four,
not a whole bloody herd!

362
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:51,588
O'Connell! Ohh!
Can you believe the cheek?

363
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,631
Just pay the man.

364
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:55,633
Oh, for heaven's sake.

365
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:58,219
Can't believe the price
of these fleabags.

366
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:00,930
Yes, happy.
Very good.

367
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:03,850
You probably could've
got 'em for free.

368
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,270
- All you had to do
was give him your sister.
- Yes.

369
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,480
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

370
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:17,822
Awfully.

371
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:44,349
Never did like camels.

372
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,309
Filthy buggers.

373
00:34:46,392 --> 00:34:48,269
They smell, they bite, they spit.

374
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,522
Disgusting.

375
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:52,524
I think they're adorable.

376
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:56,611
Oh, baby.

377
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,446
Shh!

378
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:57,273
Good morning, my friend.

379
00:37:12,622 --> 00:37:15,083
What the hell we doin'?

380
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,168
Patience, my good barat'm.
Patience.

381
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:22,090
Remember our bet, O'Connell.
First one to the city, 500 cash bucks.

382
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,592
A hundred of them bucks is yours
if you help us win that bet.

383
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,177
Oh, my pleasure.

384
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:28,137
Hey, O'Connell.

385
00:37:28,221 --> 00:37:30,807
Nice camel.

386
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:36,479
Get ready for it.

387
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,481
For what?

388
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,525
We're about to be shown the way.

389
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:55,707
Will ya look at that.

390
00:37:55,832 --> 00:37:57,667
Can you believe it?

391
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,294
Hamunaptra.

392
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,962
Here we go again.

393
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,843
- Hyah!
- Hyah!
- Teek-teek-teek-teek!

394
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:10,179
- Hyah! Hyah!

395
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,901
- Eee! Eee! Eee!
- Hyah!

396
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,861
Hyah! Hyah!

397
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:27,197
Aaah!

398
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,867
Oww!

399
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:36,873
So long, Beni!

400
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:40,168
Aaah!

401
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,712
- That serves you right.

402
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:50,178
Teek-teek-teek-teek!
Hut-hut-hut!

403
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:52,722
Teek-teek-teek!

404
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,062
Teek-teek-teek-teek!

405
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:01,356
- Ooh!

406
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,274
Ooh! Ooh!

407
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,903
Whoo!

408
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:10,907
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Evy! Go!

409
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,288
Whoo!

410
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:22,460
Whoo-hoo!

411
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:41,813
Aah!

412
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,567
Aiii!

413
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,657
Do they know somethin'
we don't?

414
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,952
They are led by a woman.

415
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:58,288
What does a woman know?

416
00:39:58,371 --> 00:40:00,290
That's a statue of Anubis.

417
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:02,292
Its legs go deep underground.

418
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:05,962
According to Bembridge scholars,
that's where we'll find
a secret compartment...

419
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:08,172
containing the golden
Book of Amun-Ra.

420
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:13,052
Jonathan, you're meant
to catch the sun with that.

421
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,932
So, uh, what are
these old mirrors for?

422
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:21,811
Ancient mirrors. It's an ancient
Egyptian trick. You'll see.

423
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:25,648
Uh, here, this is for, uh, you.

424
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,112
Go ahead. It's something
I borrowed off our American brethren.

425
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,114
I thought you might like it--

426
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,284
you might need it
for when you're, uh-- uh, yeah.

427
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,536
What are you lookin' at?

428
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,298
Hey! Look for bugs.

429
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,300
I hate bugs.

430
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,346
We're standing inside a room
no one has entered in over 3,000 years.

431
00:40:56,429 --> 00:41:00,099
Whoo! What is
that god-awful stench?

432
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:05,188
Oh.

433
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:12,362
And then there was...

434
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:14,364
light.

435
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,867
Hey, that is a neat trick.

436
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:20,537
- Oh, my God. It's a sah-netjer.
- Huh?

437
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:22,747
- A preparation room.
- Preparation for what?

438
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:26,084
For entering the afterlife.

439
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:29,671
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

440
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:42,225
What the--

441
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:48,106
What was that?

442
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:50,859
Sounds like... bugs.

443
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,861
He said bugs.

444
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:56,239
What do you mean, bugs?
I hate bugs.

445
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:15,258
The legs of Anubis.

446
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:20,263
The secret compartment
should be hidden somewhere inside here.

447
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,915
You scared the bejesus
out of us, O'Connell.

448
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,791
Likewise.

449
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,085
- Hey, that's my tool kit.
- [ O'Connell ] I don't think so.

450
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,171
Okay.

451
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,798
Perhaps I was mistaken.

452
00:42:55,924 --> 00:42:59,469
Have a nice day, gentlemen. We have
a lot of work to be getting along with.

453
00:42:59,594 --> 00:43:03,014
- Push off! This is our dig site.
- We got here first.

454
00:43:05,141 --> 00:43:07,435
This here's our statue, friend.

455
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,355
I don't see your name
written on it... pal.

456
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,608
Yes, well,
there's only four of you...

457
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,528
and 15 of me.

458
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:18,947
Your odds are not so great,
O'Connell.

459
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,616
- I've had worse.
- Yeah, me too.

460
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:27,163
Oh, look, for goodness' sake,
let's be nice, children.

461
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:30,833
If we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

462
00:43:32,794 --> 00:43:35,296
There are other places to dig.

463
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,177
According to these hieroglyphics...

464
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:43,179
we're underneath the statue.

465
00:43:43,263 --> 00:43:45,515
We should come up
right between his legs.

466
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:48,852
- When those damn Yanks
go to sleep-- No offense--
- None taken.

467
00:43:48,935 --> 00:43:51,855
we'll dig our way up and steal that book
right out from under them.

468
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:54,357
Are you sure we can find
this secret compartment?

469
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,360
Oh, yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

470
00:43:57,443 --> 00:43:59,362
- No offense.
- None taken.

471
00:43:59,445 --> 00:44:01,489
Where'd our smelly
little friend get to?

472
00:44:16,129 --> 00:44:18,047
Hey.

473
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:23,845
What have we here?

474
00:44:28,308 --> 00:44:30,727
Blue gold.

475
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:34,397
This will fetch
a mighty fine price.

476
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:49,245
- Let's get us some treasure!
- Careful!

477
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:52,040
Seti was no fool.

478
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:55,543
I think perhaps we should
let the diggers open it, hmm?

479
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:58,546
Oh, I think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

480
00:44:59,714 --> 00:45:01,591
Yeah, sure.
Let them open it.

481
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,101
Zee-eda.

482
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:15,438
Zee-eda!

483
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:17,982
Zee-eda!

484
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:26,741
Let me get this straight.

485
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,410
They ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars.

486
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:33,122
They'd take out your heart as well.
You know how they took out your brains?

487
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:35,124
I don't think we need
to know this.

488
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,169
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose...

489
00:45:38,294 --> 00:45:41,256
scramble things about a bit and then
rip it all out through your nostrils.

490
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,258
That's gotta hurt.

491
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,593
It's called mummification.
You'll be dead when they do this.

492
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:50,139
If I don't make it out of here,
don't put me down for mummification.

493
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:52,141
Likewise.

494
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,819
Oh, my God.
It's a--

495
00:46:02,944 --> 00:46:04,988
It's a sarcophagus.

496
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,659
Buried at the base of Anubis.

497
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:15,498
He must have been someone
of great importance.

498
00:46:15,582 --> 00:46:19,127
Or he did something very naughty.

499
00:46:20,253 --> 00:46:22,797
Oh, Allah.

500
00:46:25,174 --> 00:46:28,011
One more.

501
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:33,057
One more.

502
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:52,243
Help me! Help me!

503
00:46:52,368 --> 00:46:54,245
Help me!

504
00:47:12,013 --> 00:47:13,890
Well, who is it?

505
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:18,186
"He That Shall Not Be Named."

506
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:24,400
This looks like
some sort of a lock.

507
00:47:24,526 --> 00:47:27,862
- Well, whoever's in here
sure wasn't getting out.
- Yeah, no kidding.

508
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:31,366
It'd take us a month
to crack into this thing without a key.

509
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,368
A key?

510
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:36,371
A key! A key!
That's what he was talking about!

511
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,915
- Who?
- The man on the barge.

512
00:47:38,998 --> 00:47:41,292
The one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

513
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,419
Hey, that's mine.

514
00:48:08,236 --> 00:48:11,364
- What do you suppose killed him?
- Did you ever see him eat?

515
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:15,326
Seems that our American friends had
a little misfortune of their own today.

516
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:19,038
Three of their diggers
were, uh... melted.

517
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:21,124
- What?
- How?

518
00:48:21,207 --> 00:48:25,003
Salt acid.
Pressurized salt acid.

519
00:48:25,128 --> 00:48:28,298
Some kind of
ancient booby trap.

520
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:31,634
- Maybe this place really is cursed.

521
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:37,056
Oh, for goodness' sake, you two!

522
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,392
- You don't believe in curses?
- No, I don't.

523
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:43,313
I believe if I can see it
and I can touch it, it's real.
That's what I believe.

524
00:48:43,438 --> 00:48:45,648
I believe in being prepared.

525
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:49,652
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

526
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:56,951
- Aaah!
- My God, what is it?

527
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:58,953
A broken bottle.

528
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:02,832
- Glenlivet. Twelve years old!

529
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:06,836
He may have been a stinky fellow,
but he had good taste.

530
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:12,508
Take this. Stay here.

531
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:15,511
- No, wait, wait! Wait for me. Wait!
- Evy!

532
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:19,641
Excuse me, but didn't the man
just say "stay here"? Evy!

533
00:49:22,644 --> 00:49:25,730
Mr.Henderson!
Wake up!

534
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:07,897
- Hyah!
- O'Connell!

535
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,459
Enough! Yallah!

536
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:32,714
We will shed no more blood,
but you must leave.

537
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:34,924
Leave this place or die.

538
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:36,551
You have one day.

539
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:42,265
Yallah! Nimshi!

540
00:50:42,348 --> 00:50:45,393
- Yah!

541
00:51:01,451 --> 00:51:03,328
Evelyn.

542
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:06,873
Hey.

543
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:11,252
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

544
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:13,254
- You sure?
- Thank you.

545
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:17,425
That proves it. Old Seti's
fortune's got to be under this sand.

546
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:20,803
For them to protect it like this,
you know there's treasure down there.

547
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:24,641
No, these men are desert people.
They value water, not gold.

548
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:29,854
You know, maybe just at night,
we could, uh, combine forces, hmm?

549
00:51:29,979 --> 00:51:33,149
Hey, tough stuff, try a right hook.

550
00:51:33,274 --> 00:51:35,777
Ball up your fist and put it--
put it up like that.

551
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,279
- Mm-hmm.
- And then mean it. Hit it right here.

552
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:41,616
- I mean it!
- Okay.

553
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:45,954
Okay, it's time
for another drink.

554
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:49,082
Unlike my brother, sir...

555
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,501
I know when to say no.

556
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:56,005
Uh-huh. And unlike
your brother, miss...

557
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,091
you, I just don't get.

558
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:00,343
Ah. I know.

559
00:52:00,468 --> 00:52:02,345
You're wondering...

560
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:08,184
what is a place like me
doing in a girl like this.

561
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:10,228
Yeah, something like that.

562
00:52:10,353 --> 00:52:12,814
Egypt is in my blood.

563
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,483
You see, my-- my father...

564
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:19,237
was a very, very
famous explorer...

565
00:52:19,362 --> 00:52:21,656
and he loved Egypt
so much...

566
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:25,159
he married my mother,
who was an Egyptian...

567
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:28,079
and quite
an adventurer herself.

568
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:32,375
Hmm. I get your father,
and I get your mother...

569
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,836
and, uh...

570
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,046
I get him, but...

571
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:39,048
what are you doing here?

572
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:41,050
Ohh!

573
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:44,053
Look, I--
I may not be...

574
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:46,055
an explorer...

575
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:48,558
or-or an adventurer...

576
00:52:48,683 --> 00:52:51,769
or a treasure seeker
or a gunfighter...

577
00:52:51,895 --> 00:52:54,772
Mr.O'Connell...

578
00:52:54,898 --> 00:52:58,693
but I am proud
of what I am.

579
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:01,404
And what is that?

580
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,406
I...

581
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:06,951
am a librarian.

582
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,249
And I am going
to kiss you...

583
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:15,877
Mr.O'Connell.

584
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,296
Call me Rick.

585
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:20,298
Oh!

586
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:24,135
Oh, Rick.

587
00:53:41,486 --> 00:53:43,446
Awam, awam!

588
00:53:48,618 --> 00:53:50,495
Djaceb, djaceb.

589
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,716
- There is a curse upon this chest.
- Curse, my ass.

590
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,386
- Who cares?
- Have a care, Mr.Henderson.

591
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:09,556
In these hallowed grounds, that which
was set forth in ancient times...

592
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:12,392
- is as strong today as it was then.
- We understand.

593
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:14,394
What's it say?

594
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,903
"Death will come
on swift wings...

595
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:27,323
to whomsoever
opens this chest."

596
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:40,503
We should not be here.

597
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:42,505
This is not good.

598
00:54:42,589 --> 00:54:44,841
It says, "There is one...

599
00:54:44,924 --> 00:54:46,843
the undead...

600
00:54:46,926 --> 00:54:49,929
who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law...

601
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:52,056
to consummate this curse."

602
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:55,018
Let's make sure we don't bring anyone
back from the dead then.

603
00:54:55,101 --> 00:54:58,396
"He will kill all
who open this chest...

604
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:02,609
and assimilate
their organs and fluids...

605
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:05,486
and in so doing,
he will regenerate...

606
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,364
and no longer be
the undead...

607
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:12,660
but a plague
upon this Earth."

608
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:15,914
Well, we didn't come
all this way for nothin'.

609
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:17,916
- That's right.
- It's the curse.

610
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,210
It's the curse.

611
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:23,421
It's the curse!
Beware of the curse!

612
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:25,548
Beware!

613
00:55:25,673 --> 00:55:28,384
Stupid superstitious bastard.

614
00:55:29,928 --> 00:55:33,223
Oh, I've dreamt about this
since I was a little girl.

615
00:55:33,348 --> 00:55:35,225
You dream about dead guys?

616
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:38,228
Look, his sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

617
00:55:38,353 --> 00:55:41,397
This man must have been condemned
not only in this life but in the next.

618
00:55:41,523 --> 00:55:44,067
- Tough break.
- Yeah, I'm all tears.

619
00:55:44,192 --> 00:55:48,154
Now, let's see who's inside, shall we?

620
00:55:57,956 --> 00:56:00,583
Oh, my God, I hate it
when these things do that.

621
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:02,585
Is he supposed to
look like that?

622
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,380
No, I've never seen a mummy
look like this before.

623
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,715
He's still-- still--

624
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:09,884
- Juicy.
- Yes.

625
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:13,096
He must be more
than 3,000 years old...

626
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:15,598
and, well, it looks
as if he's still...

627
00:56:15,723 --> 00:56:18,226
decomposing.

628
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:21,396
Hey, look at that.

629
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,815
What do you make of this?

630
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,818
My God, these marks
were made with...

631
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:30,405
fingernails.

632
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,783
This man was buried alive.

633
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:35,785
And he left a message.

634
00:56:37,412 --> 00:56:40,915
"Death is only the beginning."

635
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:02,020
Oh, my God.

636
00:57:02,145 --> 00:57:04,772
It does exist.

637
00:57:04,856 --> 00:57:07,525
- The Book of the Dead.
- A book?

638
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,278
Who cares about a book?
Where the hell's the treasure?

639
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:13,031
This, gentlemen...

640
00:57:13,156 --> 00:57:15,700
this is treasure.

641
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,996
Hell, I wouldn't trade you
for a brass--

642
00:57:22,207 --> 00:57:25,293
Look at that.

643
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:27,670
There's your treasure, gentlemen.

644
00:57:27,754 --> 00:57:29,672
Now we're onto something.

645
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:48,399
I believe you need a key
to open that book.

646
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:54,197
Say, O'Connell, what do you think
these babies'll fetch back home?

647
00:57:54,322 --> 00:57:56,950
We hear you boys found yourselves
a nice, gooey mummy.

648
00:57:57,075 --> 00:57:58,701
Congratulations.

649
00:57:58,785 --> 00:58:01,746
If you dry that fella out, you might
be able to sell him for firewood.

650
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:04,249
Look what I found.

651
00:58:04,374 --> 00:58:06,251
- You're in her seat.

652
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:08,253
- Now!
- Yup.

653
00:58:08,378 --> 00:58:11,005
Scarab skeletons,
flesh eaters.

654
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:13,591
I found them inside
our friend's coffin.

655
00:58:13,716 --> 00:58:17,929
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

656
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:21,724
Unfortunately for our friend,
he was still alive
when they started eating him.

657
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:26,062
So somebody threw these in with our guy,
and then they slowly ate him alive?

658
00:58:26,187 --> 00:58:28,064
Very slowly.

659
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:30,984
He certainly wasn't a popular fellow
when they planted him.

660
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:35,363
Well, he probably got a little
too frisky with the pharaoh's daughter.

661
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:37,740
Well, according
to my readings...

662
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:42,161
our friend suffered
the Hom-Dai, the worst
of all ancient Egyptian curses...

663
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:45,290
one reserved only
for the most evil of blasphemers.

664
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:48,459
In my research, I've never heard of this
curse having actually been performed.

665
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:51,129
- That bad, huh?
- Yes, well, they--

666
00:58:51,254 --> 00:58:54,090
They never used it
because they feared it so.

667
00:58:54,173 --> 00:58:58,595
It's written that if a victim
of the Hom-Dai should ever arise...

668
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:01,973
he would bring with him
the ten plagues of Egypt.

669
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,220
That's called stealing,
you know.

670
00:59:34,345 --> 00:59:36,305
According to you
and my brother...

671
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:38,558
it's called borrowing.

672
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,604
I thought the Book of Amun-Ra
was made out of gold.

673
00:59:43,729 --> 00:59:47,733
It is made out of gold.
This isn't the Book of Amun-Ra.

674
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,944
This is something else.

675
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:53,197
- I think this may be
the Book of the Dead.

676
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:55,199
The Book of the Dead?

677
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:57,994
Are you sure you want to
be playing around with this thing?

678
00:59:58,077 --> 01:00:01,163
It's just a book.
No harm ever came from...

679
01:00:01,289 --> 01:00:04,041
reading a book.

680
01:00:08,921 --> 01:00:11,424
That happens a lot around here.

681
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:15,303
So, what's it say?

682
01:00:15,386 --> 01:00:19,181
"Amun Ra. Amun Dei."

683
01:00:19,265 --> 01:00:21,517
It speaks of the night
and of the day.

684
01:00:35,114 --> 01:00:37,867
- No!

685
01:00:37,992 --> 01:00:41,162
- You must not read from the book!

686
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,376
Huh?

687
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,397
Run!

688
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:12,401
Go, go!

689
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:22,912
What have we done?

690
01:01:23,037 --> 01:01:25,248
Where the hell
did they come from?

691
01:01:25,373 --> 01:01:27,750
I ain't waitin' around to find out.

692
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,797
My glasses. My glasses!

693
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:35,258
Leave me! Leave me!

694
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:37,718
Hey! Hey!

695
01:01:37,802 --> 01:01:41,389
Could you help me
find my gl-- Oh.

696
01:01:42,807 --> 01:01:45,434
Wait for me!

697
01:02:06,581 --> 01:02:10,001
Who's there?

698
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:14,463
Who's there?

699
01:02:27,268 --> 01:02:29,228
Henderson?


700
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:54,879
- Ah, Jon!

701
01:03:01,636 --> 01:03:03,512
Scarabs!

702
01:03:03,638 --> 01:03:06,557
- Run, Evy!
- Go, go, go! Run!

703
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,373
Aaah!

704
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,799
- Evelyn?
- Evy?

705
01:03:39,924 --> 01:03:42,093
- Evelyn!
- Evy!

706
01:03:54,605 --> 01:03:57,483
Oh. Oh, Mr.Burns.
Thank goodness.

707
01:03:57,608 --> 01:04:00,069
I was just starting
to get scared.

708
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:03,281
- I've lost everyone. I

709
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,741
My eyes. My eyes.

710
01:04:07,994 --> 01:04:10,246
Aaah!

711
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,128
Oh.

712
01:04:25,219 --> 01:04:28,472
- Please help me.

713
01:04:30,349 --> 01:04:34,020
My tongue. He took my tongue.

714
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,439
- Please don't leave me.

715
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:40,651
- Anck-su-namun?

716
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,778
Damn it!
It's a trap door.

717
01:04:42,904 --> 01:04:45,531
There's gotta be a switch or something
around here someplace.

718
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:49,035
Run, you sons of bitches! Run!

719
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,370
Go.

720
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,207
Aah!

721
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,001
Aah! Aah! Aah!

722
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,009
Go! Go!

723
01:05:15,603 --> 01:05:18,731
There you are!
Will you quit playing hide-and-seek?

724
01:05:18,856 --> 01:05:21,484
Come on.
Let's get out of here. Whoa!

725
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:23,819
Evy!

726
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,831
- Ohh!

727
01:05:35,957 --> 01:05:38,334
- Move!
- Yeah, right. Did you see that?

728
01:05:38,459 --> 01:05:42,505
- It was walking. It was walking!

729
01:05:50,221 --> 01:05:54,308
I told you to leave or die.
You refused.

730
01:05:54,392 --> 01:05:56,519
Now you may have
killed us all...

731
01:05:56,644 --> 01:05:59,897
for you have unleashed
a creature we have feared
for more than 3,000 years.

732
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:03,442
- Relax. I got him.
- No mortal weapon
can kill this creature.

733
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,862
He's not of this world.

734
01:06:13,828 --> 01:06:16,330
- You bastards.
- What did you do to him?

735
01:06:16,455 --> 01:06:19,500
We saved him, saved him before
the creature could finish his work.

736
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:23,421
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

737
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,382
Yallah. Nimishi.

738
01:06:26,507 --> 01:06:30,720
We must now go on the hunt
and try and find a way to kill him.

739
01:06:30,845 --> 01:06:33,347
I already told you I got him.

740
01:06:35,683 --> 01:06:37,560
Know this.

741
01:06:37,685 --> 01:06:40,313
This creature
is the bringer of death.

742
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,191
He will never eat,
he will never sleep...

743
01:06:43,274 --> 01:06:45,276
and he will never stop.

744
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:21,437
May the good Lord protect
and watch over me...

745
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,023
as a shepherd
watches over his flock.

746
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:40,790
No? Okay.

747
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:16,868
My prince.

748
01:08:23,624 --> 01:08:26,961
Hyah!

749
01:08:27,044 --> 01:08:29,881
Teek-teek-teek-teek. Hut-hut-hut!

750
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:54,030
I thought you said you didn't
believe in that fairy tales
and hokum stuff. Shoo!

751
01:08:54,155 --> 01:08:58,242
H-Having an encounter
with a 3,000-year-old
walking, talking corpse...

752
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,244
does tend to convert one.

753
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:03,331
Forget it. We're out the door,
down the hall and we're gone.

754
01:09:03,414 --> 01:09:06,250
- Oh, no, we are not.
- Oh, yes, we are.

755
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,253
Oh, no, we are not. We woke him up,
and we are going to stop him.

756
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,589
"We"? What we?
We didn't read that book.

757
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,508
I told you not to play around
with that thing. Didn't I tell you?

758
01:09:14,592 --> 01:09:17,762
Yes, then me, me, me, me,
I, I, I woke him up
and I intend to stop him.

759
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:21,724
Yeah? How? You heard the man--
no mortal weapons can kill this guy.

760
01:09:21,849 --> 01:09:24,936
Then we are just going to
have to find some immortal ones.

761
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:28,940
- There goes that "we" again.
- Will you listen to me? We have to do--

762
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:31,025
- Aaah!
- Once this creature has been reborn...

763
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,402
his curse is going to spread until
the whole of the Earth is destroyed.

764
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:36,489
- Yeah? Is that my problem?
- It is everybody's problem.

765
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,700
Evelyn, I appreciate you saving my life
and all, but when I signed on...

766
01:09:39,825 --> 01:09:42,370
I agreed to take you out there
and to bring you back.

767
01:09:42,495 --> 01:09:44,747
I have done that.
End of job. End of story.

768
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:47,250
- Contract terminated.
- That's all I am to you? A contract?

769
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,252
You can either
tag along with me...

770
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:51,796
or you can stay here...
and try and save the world!

771
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,798
- What's it gonna be?
- I'm staying.

772
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,800
- Fine!
- Fine.

773
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,969
- Fine.
- Fine.

774
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:02,431
- Fine.
- Ooh!

775
01:10:05,518 --> 01:10:09,480
I'm the last of the Royal Air Corps
still stationed out here, you know.

776
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,859
Some bloody idiot
spilled his drink.

777
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:16,779
All the other laddies died in the sky
and were buried in the sand.

778
01:10:16,863 --> 01:10:19,699
Good chaps,
every one of them too. Ooh.

779
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:23,661
- Hi, Winston.
- Ye-- Uh-- You know, O'Connell.

780
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,247
Ever since the end
of the great war...

781
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:29,333
there hasn't been a--
a single challenge...

782
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,878
- worthy of a man like me.
- Yeah?

783
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:34,213
We all got our little
problems today, Winston.

784
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:37,216
I just wish I could have
chucked it in with the others...

785
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,385
and gone down
in flame and glory...

786
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,387
instead of sitting
around here...

787
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,639
[ Together ]
rotting of boredom and booze.

788
01:10:43,764 --> 01:10:46,350
Cheers. Mmm.

789
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:51,814
Mmm. Oh, well, back to the airfield.

790
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:54,817
- Tell me, has your sister always been--
- Oh, yes, always.

791
01:10:54,942 --> 01:10:57,820
We're all packed up, but the damn boat
doesn't leave till tomorrow morning.

792
01:10:57,945 --> 01:11:00,406
Tail set firmly
between your legs, I see.

793
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,701
You can talk. You don't have
some sacred walkin' corpse after ya.

794
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,663
So, uh, how's your friend?

795
01:11:07,788 --> 01:11:12,919
He had his eyes and his tongue
ripped out. How would you be?

796
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,421
I'm so pleased...

797
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,423
to meet you.

798
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:21,344
Prince Imhotep
does not like to be touched.

799
01:11:21,427 --> 01:11:24,972
A silly Eastern superstition,
I'm afraid.

800
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:27,016
Please forgive me.

801
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:30,853
Oh-ho. Ohh. Whoops.

802
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:32,855
Mr.Burns...

803
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:36,192
Prince Imhotep thanks you
for your hospitality.

804
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:38,277
No.

805
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:41,030
And for your eyes...

806
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:43,991
- and for your tongue.
- Wha--

807
01:11:44,075 --> 01:11:47,370
- But I am afraid more is needed.
- Wha--

808
01:11:47,453 --> 01:11:49,372
The prince must finish the job...

809
01:11:49,455 --> 01:11:54,126
- and consummate the curse
which you and your friends...
- No! No!

810
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,879
- have brought down upon yourselves.
- Wait! No!

811
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:01,884
Good luck, boys.

812
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:11,477
Sweet Jesus!
Tasted just like--

813
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:13,854
- Blood.

814
01:12:13,938 --> 01:12:17,650
"And the rivers and waters
of Egypt ran red...

815
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,069
and were as blood."

816
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:23,406
He's here.

817
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:29,912
Oh, looks like
there's gonna be a storm.

818
01:12:29,996 --> 01:12:32,498
- Oh, Evelyn!
- Oh, so you're still here.

819
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:35,835
- We've got problems.

820
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:43,259
- Aaah!

821
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,400
- Hey!

822
01:12:59,483 --> 01:13:02,320
Beni, you little stinkweed.
Where you been?

823
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,056
We are in serious trouble.

824
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:34,894
- Aah!

825
01:13:39,941 --> 01:13:42,068
Aaah!

826
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:10,346
We are in very serious trouble.

827
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,349
He does seem to like Evy.

828
01:14:13,432 --> 01:14:15,351
Yeah, what's that about?

829
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:19,522
- What's this guy want?
- There's only one person
that can give us any answers.

830
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:21,899
- You!
- Miss Carnahan.

831
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:24,694
- Gentlemen.
- What is he doing here?

832
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:28,531
Do you really want to know,
or would you prefer to just shoot us?

833
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:30,658
After what I just saw...

834
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,411
I'm willing to go
on a little faith here.

835
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:36,372
We are part of
an ancient secret society.

836
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:39,876
For over 3,000 years
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

837
01:14:39,959 --> 01:14:43,713
We are sworn at manhood
to do any and all in our power
to stop the High Priest Imhotep...

838
01:14:43,796 --> 01:14:47,466
- from being reborn into this world.
- Because of you, we have failed.

839
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:50,094
You think this justifies
the killing of innocent people?

840
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,471
- To stop this creature?
Let me think. Yes!
- Yes!

841
01:14:55,141 --> 01:14:57,935
Question:
Why doesn't he like cats?

842
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,814
Cats are the guardians of the
underworld. He will fear them
until he is fully regenerated.

843
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:05,109
- Then he will fear nothing.
- You know how he gets hisself
fully regenerated?

844
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:09,155
- By killin' everyone
who opened that chest.
- And suckin' 'em dry!

845
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,365
Jonathan, will you stop
playing with that?

846
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:16,245
When I saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-su-namun.

847
01:15:18,206 --> 01:15:21,667
And then just now
in Mr.Burns' quarters,
h-he tried to kiss me.

848
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,754
It's because of his love
for Anck-su-namun that he was cursed.

849
01:15:24,837 --> 01:15:27,673
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years--
- He is still in love with her.

850
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:30,801
Yes, that is very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

851
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:33,804
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

852
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:38,142
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.

853
01:15:40,061 --> 01:15:41,938
Bad luck, old mum.

854
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:45,358
On the contrary, it may
just give us the time we need...

855
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:47,360
to kill the creature.

856
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:52,031
We will need all the help we can get.
His powers are growing.

857
01:15:57,537 --> 01:16:01,207
"And he stretched forth
his hand towards the heavens...

858
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:05,044
and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt."

859
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,547
We must stop him from regenerating.

860
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:10,216
- Who opened that chest?
- There was me and Daniels here.

861
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,802
- And Burns, of course.
- And that Egyptologist fellow.

862
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:16,347
- What about my buddy Beni?
- No, he scrammed outta there
'fore we opened the thing.

863
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:19,350
- Yeah, he was the smart one.
- Well, that sounds like Beni.

864
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:23,187
We must find the Egyptologist and bring
him back to the safety of the fort...

865
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,189
- before the creature can get to him.
- Right.

866
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:29,193
- She stays here.
You three, come with me.

867
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:32,446
You can't leave me behind
like some old carpetbag.

868
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:36,158
Who put you in charge? O'Connell,
what do you think you are doing?

869
01:16:36,284 --> 01:16:39,662
- Jonathan! O'Connell!
- Sorry, but he's a bit... tall.

870
01:16:39,745 --> 01:16:43,332
Coward that you are! O'Connell,
you are not leaving me in here!

871
01:16:43,457 --> 01:16:46,669
Jonathan, if you don't open this door
in one minute flat--

872
01:16:46,794 --> 01:16:48,838
- O'Connell, let me out of here.
- This door doesn't open.

873
01:16:48,963 --> 01:16:51,674
- She doesn't come out,
and no one goes in, right?
- Right.

874
01:16:51,799 --> 01:16:54,051
- Right?
- Right.

875
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:57,597
- O'Connell! Jonathan!
- Let's go, Jonathan.

876
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,766
Oh, I thought I could just stay
at the fort and, uh, reconnoiter.

877
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:04,520
- Now!
- Yeah, right. We're just
gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

878
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:41,098
Well, well, well.
Let me guess. Spring cleaning.

879
01:17:45,478 --> 01:17:48,147
Nice shot.

880
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:51,359
- Oh, Beni, did you fall down?
Let me help you up.

881
01:17:53,194 --> 01:17:56,697
You came back from the desert
with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

882
01:17:56,822 --> 01:17:59,075
What friend?
You are my only friend.

883
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,577
Yaah!

884
01:18:01,702 --> 01:18:05,414
What the hell are you doing
with this creep? What's in it for you?

885
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:09,585
It is better to be the right hand
of the devil than in his path.

886
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:13,256
As long as I serve him,
I am immune.

887
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:19,470
- Immune from what?
- Piszkas allat.

888
01:18:19,595 --> 01:18:23,766
- What did you say?
- I don't wanna tell you.
You'll just hurt me some more.

889
01:18:23,849 --> 01:18:27,103
- What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

890
01:18:27,186 --> 01:18:31,148
The book! The black book they found
at Hamunaptra. He wants it back.

891
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:33,734
He said to me it would be
worth its weight in gold.

892
01:18:33,818 --> 01:18:36,320
- What does he want the book for?
- I don't know.

893
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:40,032
Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

894
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:42,952
But that's all.
He just wants the book, I swear.

895
01:18:43,077 --> 01:18:46,122
Just the book, I swear.
And your sister.

896
01:18:46,247 --> 01:18:47,957
- But other than that--

897
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:49,208
- But other than that--

898
01:19:37,965 --> 01:19:40,218
That's two down,
two to go.

899
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:42,595
Then he'll be coming after Evy.

900
01:19:42,678 --> 01:19:45,806
Guards in place!
Reporting all clear, sir!

901
01:19:45,932 --> 01:19:47,850
To hell with this.

902
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:50,228
I'm goin' downstairs, get me a drink.
You want somethin'?

903
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:52,813
- Yeah. Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon.
- All right.

904
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:55,399
- A-And a shot of bourbon.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

905
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:57,985
- And a bourbon chaser.
- I'll get your damn bourbon!

906
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:00,571
Don't worry about the door.

907
01:20:39,485 --> 01:20:42,363
- Aaah! Aaah!

908
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:42,381
Anck-su-namun.

909
01:21:52,892 --> 01:21:55,853
Hey, get your ugly face off of her!

910
01:21:59,482 --> 01:22:01,567
- Look what I got.

911
01:22:18,084 --> 01:22:21,754
- You all right?
- Well, I'm not sure.

912
01:22:31,806 --> 01:22:35,851
Well, according to legend,
the black book the Americans
found at Hamunaptra...

913
01:22:35,977 --> 01:22:38,062
is supposed to bring people
back from the dead.

914
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,773
- Until now it was a notion
I was unwilling to believe.
- Believe it, sister.

915
01:22:40,898 --> 01:22:42,859
That's what brought
our buddy back to life.

916
01:22:42,942 --> 01:22:46,195
I'm thinking that if the black book
can bring dead people to life--

917
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:50,074
- Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
- That's the myth.

918
01:22:50,157 --> 01:22:53,619
Now we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

919
01:22:53,744 --> 01:22:56,706
Imhotep. Imhotep.

920
01:22:56,831 --> 01:22:58,749
Imhotep.

921
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:02,920
Imhotep. Imhotep.

922
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:04,922
Imhotep.

923
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:07,216
Imhotep.

924
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,135
Imhotep.

925
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:11,596
Imhotep.

926
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,725
Imhotep. Imhotep.

927
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,394
- Imhotep.
- Last but not least...

928
01:23:18,477 --> 01:23:21,272
my favorite plague--
boils and sores.

929
01:23:21,355 --> 01:23:23,774
They have become his slaves.

930
01:23:23,858 --> 01:23:27,111
So it has begun,
the beginning of the end.

931
01:23:27,195 --> 01:23:30,323
Not quite yet, it hasn't.
Come on.

932
01:23:30,448 --> 01:23:34,911
Imhotep. Imhotep.

933
01:23:39,624 --> 01:23:44,670
Imhotep. Imhotep.

934
01:23:52,428 --> 01:23:55,306
According to Bembridge scholars,
the golden Book of Amun-Ra...

935
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:57,558
is located inside
the statue of Anubis.

936
01:23:57,642 --> 01:23:59,769
- That's where we found the black book.
- Exactly.

937
01:23:59,894 --> 01:24:03,314
- Looks like the old boys
at Bembridge were mistaken.
- They mixed the books up.

938
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:05,316
Mixed up where
they were buried.

939
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:08,402
So if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis...

940
01:24:08,486 --> 01:24:11,030
then the golden book
must be inside--

941
01:24:16,494 --> 01:24:19,539
- Come on, Evy. Faster.
- Patience is a virtue.

942
01:24:20,873 --> 01:24:22,792
Not right now it isn't.

943
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:25,419
Uh, I think I'll go
and get the car started.

944
01:24:25,503 --> 01:24:30,341
I've got it. The golden
Book of Amun-Ra is at Hamunaptra
inside the statue of Horus.

945
01:24:30,466 --> 01:24:32,718
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

946
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:44,981
Imhotep.

947
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:47,984
Imhotep.

948
01:24:48,067 --> 01:24:52,989
Imhotep. Imhotep.

949
01:24:53,072 --> 01:24:57,368
Imhotep.
Imhotep.

950
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:05,376
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

951
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:09,046
- Get this thing in gear, boy.
Let's get outta here.
- Evy!

952
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:11,674
- Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
- Imhotep!

953
01:25:11,757 --> 01:25:13,551
Imhotep!

954
01:25:19,473 --> 01:25:22,685
You're gonna get yours, Beni!
You hear me?

955
01:25:22,768 --> 01:25:27,023
- You're gonna get yours!
- Oh, like I've never heard that before!

956
01:25:52,173 --> 01:25:54,050
Aaah!

957
01:25:57,595 --> 01:25:59,472
Hang on!

958
01:26:03,851 --> 01:26:06,562
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

959
01:26:28,209 --> 01:26:30,336
Aaah!

960
01:26:35,424 --> 01:26:37,593
Hey! O'Connell!
O'Connell!

961
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:35,234
Okay! Go, go!

962
01:27:42,366 --> 01:27:45,912
Imhotep. Imhotep.

963
01:27:46,037 --> 01:27:48,497
Imhotep.

964
01:27:48,581 --> 01:27:50,249
Imhotep.

965
01:27:50,374 --> 01:27:52,501
Imhotep.

966
01:27:52,585 --> 01:27:55,171
Imhotep. Imhotep.

967
01:27:58,466 --> 01:28:00,009
It's the creature.

968
01:28:00,092 --> 01:28:02,595
He's fully regenerated.

969
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,805
Keetah mi pharos...

970
01:28:04,889 --> 01:28:07,725
aja nilo, isirian.

971
01:28:07,808 --> 01:28:09,852
"Come with me, my princess.

972
01:28:09,936 --> 01:28:13,731
It is time
to make you mine forever."

973
01:28:13,856 --> 01:28:16,734
"For all eternity," idiot.

974
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:19,278
Koontash dai na...

975
01:28:19,403 --> 01:28:21,280
aja nilo.

976
01:28:21,405 --> 01:28:23,741
"Take my hand...

977
01:28:23,824 --> 01:28:25,868
and I will spare
your friends."

978
01:28:25,993 --> 01:28:29,288
- Oh, dear.

979
01:28:29,413 --> 01:28:32,583
- Have you got any bright ideas?
- I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'.

980
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:36,337
You better think of something fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy...

981
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,923
you're the first one
I'm coming after.

982
01:28:42,802 --> 01:28:44,387
- No.
- Don't!

983
01:28:44,512 --> 01:28:48,266
- No!
- He has to take me to Hamunaptra
to perform the ritual.

984
01:28:48,391 --> 01:28:51,394
She is right.
Live today, fight tomorrow.

985
01:29:02,738 --> 01:29:05,658
I'll be seeing you again.

986
01:29:11,581 --> 01:29:13,833
Evelyn!

987
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:18,588
- Hey, that's mine.
- Thank you.

988
01:29:21,549 --> 01:29:23,467
No! Let go of me!

989
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:25,428
- Imhotep.
- Let go of me!

990
01:29:25,511 --> 01:29:29,098
- Good-bye, my friend.
- Come here, you little--

991
01:29:29,181 --> 01:29:33,603
Imhotep. Imhotep.

992
01:29:35,813 --> 01:29:38,649
- Imhotep.
- Come on!

993
01:29:38,774 --> 01:29:42,361
- What about my sister?
- We're gonna get her back! Go!

994
01:29:42,486 --> 01:29:45,114
- You're next!

995
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:47,283
Come on!
Give me your hand!

996
01:29:47,408 --> 01:29:49,118
- You go!
- Come on!

997
01:29:49,243 --> 01:29:51,954
Go!

998
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,572
Morning, Winston.
Uh, a word?

999
01:30:26,697 --> 01:30:31,702
What's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

1000
01:30:31,827 --> 01:30:35,331
Not a damn thing.

1001
01:30:35,456 --> 01:30:38,251
- Is it dangerous?
- You probably won't live through it.

1002
01:30:38,376 --> 01:30:40,670
By Jove, do you really think so?

1003
01:30:40,753 --> 01:30:42,880
Everybody else we've bumped into
has died. Why not you?

1004
01:30:43,005 --> 01:30:45,341
What's the, uh--
What's the challenge then?

1005
01:30:45,424 --> 01:30:48,636
Rescue the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy and save the world.

1006
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:53,558
Oh! 
Winston Havelock at your service, sir.

1007
01:31:04,402 --> 01:31:06,737
Are you all right?

1008
01:31:06,821 --> 01:31:09,949
Do I bloody look all right?

1009
01:31:12,034 --> 01:31:15,079
How you doin'?

1010
01:31:25,298 --> 01:31:28,885
See that?
I've never seen one so big.

1011
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:31,429
- Never?
- No!

1012
01:31:43,608 --> 01:31:47,236
- Get off of me! Get off!

1013
01:31:48,654 --> 01:31:51,240
I need a new job.

1014
01:32:10,343 --> 01:32:12,261
Oh, my God.

1015
01:32:12,345 --> 01:32:14,513
We're back.

1016
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,111
O'Connell.

1017
01:32:40,665 --> 01:32:43,709
Oh, my God.

1018
01:32:45,294 --> 01:32:48,839
Hey, Winston!
Pedal faster!

1019
01:32:51,592 --> 01:32:54,011
Hang on, men!

1020
01:33:20,037 --> 01:33:21,914
Aaah!

1021
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:28,713
- Aah!

1022
01:33:36,637 --> 01:33:38,890
Stop it!
You'll kill them!

1023
01:33:39,015 --> 01:33:41,517
That's the idea.

1024
01:33:52,278 --> 01:33:54,447
Aaaah!

1025
01:33:56,824 --> 01:33:59,577
Here I come, laddies!

1026
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:28,022
I love the whole
sand wall trick.

1027
01:34:28,105 --> 01:34:30,650
It was beautiful. Bastard.

1028
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:50,378
Excuse me.

1029
01:34:50,461 --> 01:34:53,881
Um, a little help
would be useful...

1030
01:34:53,965 --> 01:34:56,092
if it's not too much trouble!

1031
01:34:56,217 --> 01:34:59,136
Yeah, yeah. All right.

1032
01:35:04,267 --> 01:35:07,937
- Winston! Hey, Winston!

1033
01:35:22,743 --> 01:35:26,038
Quicksand!
Get back! It's quicksand.

1034
01:36:14,337 --> 01:36:16,714
Keep moving!

1035
01:36:16,839 --> 01:36:21,219
Nasty little fellows such as yourself
always get their comeuppance.

1036
01:36:21,344 --> 01:36:24,889
Really? They do?

1037
01:36:25,014 --> 01:36:27,391
Oh, yes. Always.

1038
01:36:34,398 --> 01:36:37,527
I'd take
those bigger stones first.

1039
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:40,696
Take them from the top, otherwise
the whole thing will cave in on us.

1040
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:43,366
Come on.
Put your backs into it.

1041
01:36:44,784 --> 01:36:48,037
Yes, well, you've got the idea.
Chop-chop.

1042
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,881
I say!

1043
01:37:00,758 --> 01:37:03,427
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

1044
01:37:11,894 --> 01:37:13,938
- What?

1045
01:37:14,063 --> 01:37:15,940
It's in my arm!
My arm!

1046
01:37:17,608 --> 01:37:19,110
- Whoa!

1047
01:37:19,235 --> 01:37:21,112
- Do something!
- Hold him!

1048
01:37:21,195 --> 01:37:24,282
Do something! Do something!
Not that! Not that!

1049
01:37:34,292 --> 01:37:36,627
O'Connell.

1050
01:37:41,132 --> 01:37:44,677
Shatay Wapay Ku Ra Eck!

1051
01:38:01,569 --> 01:38:04,113
Bembridge scholars
never wrote about this.

1052
01:38:09,577 --> 01:38:12,121
Get off me.
Get off!

1053
01:38:58,292 --> 01:39:00,086
Wha-- Wha--

1054
01:39:21,065 --> 01:39:23,067
- Can you see--
- Yeah.

1055
01:39:23,192 --> 01:39:25,611
- Can you believe--
- Yeah.

1056
01:39:25,736 --> 01:39:28,364
- Can we just--
- No.

1057
01:39:38,499 --> 01:39:41,294
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Priests.

1058
01:39:41,419 --> 01:39:43,754
Imhotep's priests.

1059
01:39:43,838 --> 01:39:45,965
- All right then.

1060
01:40:33,387 --> 01:40:35,306
There he is!

1061
01:40:35,389 --> 01:40:37,808
- Hello, Horus, old boy.

1062
01:40:46,609 --> 01:40:48,486
Time to close the door.

1063
01:41:01,707 --> 01:41:05,086
Let's go.

1064
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,571
Anck-su-namun.

1065
01:41:40,204 --> 01:41:43,583
O'Connell!
Jonathan!

1066
01:41:51,674 --> 01:41:55,177
- Damn.

1067
01:41:55,303 --> 01:41:59,932
- These guys just don't quit, do they?
- Keep digging.

1068
01:42:22,413 --> 01:42:24,957
Oh! The Book of Amun-Ra.

1069
01:42:31,047 --> 01:42:34,717
- Save the girl.

1070
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,386
Kill the creature. Aaaah!

1071
01:42:48,898 --> 01:42:52,568
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

1072
01:42:59,659 --> 01:43:01,577
You all right?
Let's go.

1073
01:43:57,967 --> 01:44:01,053
The Book of Amun-Ra!
I found it, Evy! I found it!

1074
01:44:02,889 --> 01:44:05,725
Shut up
and get me off here, Jonathan!

1075
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:09,478
Open the book, Jonathan.
It's the only way to kill him.

1076
01:44:09,604 --> 01:44:12,648
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

1077
01:44:12,732 --> 01:44:15,818
Well, I can't open it!
It's locked or something.

1078
01:44:18,112 --> 01:44:21,908
- We need the key, Evy!
- It's inside his robes.

1079
01:44:27,288 --> 01:44:28,831
- Haah!
- O'Connell!

1080
01:44:28,998 --> 01:44:32,835
Im Yub Set Na.

1081
01:44:32,919 --> 01:44:35,671
Hyah! Hyah! Hah!

1082
01:44:44,055 --> 01:44:46,390
Hyah! Hyah!

1083
01:45:01,447 --> 01:45:02,740
Mummies. Aah!

1084
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,116
Mummies. Aah!

1085
01:45:05,326 --> 01:45:08,871
- Aah!

1086
01:45:14,585 --> 01:45:18,381
Look out! There's one down--
O'Connell!

1087
01:45:24,428 --> 01:45:26,931
Huh?

1088
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:45,408
- Here's an inscription.

1089
01:45:45,491 --> 01:45:49,620
- "Rasheem-- Rasheem oola--
Rasheem oola Kashka!"

1090
01:46:03,634 --> 01:46:05,970
Oh, boy.

1091
01:46:11,642 --> 01:46:13,603
- Oh, yeah.

1092
01:46:13,728 --> 01:46:16,647
- This just keeps gettin'
better and better.
- Ohh.

1093
01:46:16,731 --> 01:46:18,941
- Do something, Jonathan.
- Me?

1094
01:46:19,066 --> 01:46:22,111
- You can command them.
- You have got to be joking.

1095
01:46:22,236 --> 01:46:24,405
Finish the inscription
on the cover, idiot.

1096
01:46:24,488 --> 01:46:27,950
- Then you can control them.
- Oh. Right.

1097
01:46:44,425 --> 01:46:48,346
Aaaaah!

1098
01:46:50,848 --> 01:46:53,184
Uh-uh.

1099
01:46:54,977 --> 01:46:56,854
Oh, oh, oh!

1100
01:47:04,153 --> 01:47:07,198
Hurry up, Jonathan!

1101
01:47:17,583 --> 01:47:20,670
- Aah!

1102
01:47:28,469 --> 01:47:30,513
Hah!

1103
01:47:30,596 --> 01:47:32,515
Hyah!

1104
01:47:35,643 --> 01:47:38,479
Ohh!

1105
01:47:38,563 --> 01:47:41,482
- I can't figure out this last symbol.
- What does it look like?

1106
01:47:56,414 --> 01:47:59,792
It's a, uh, a bird--
a stork!

1107
01:48:11,762 --> 01:48:15,141
A-Ahmenophus!

1108
01:48:15,266 --> 01:48:17,727
Oh, yes, I see.

1109
01:48:22,356 --> 01:48:25,776
Whoa!

1110
01:48:31,407 --> 01:48:34,619
Uh, Hootash im Ahmenophus.

1111
01:48:58,392 --> 01:49:00,603
Fa-Kooshka
Anck-su-namun!

1112
01:49:03,814 --> 01:49:06,526
- Anck-su-namun!

1113
01:49:15,576 --> 01:49:18,246
- Imhotep!
- Anck-su-namun!

1114
01:49:39,809 --> 01:49:42,103
Aaah!

1115
01:49:45,815 --> 01:49:48,609
Evy! I've got it.

1116
01:49:52,738 --> 01:49:56,701
- Keep him busy.
- Aaah! Oof!

1117
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,204
No problem.

1118
01:50:04,792 --> 01:50:06,878
Aaah!

1119
01:50:10,923 --> 01:50:13,134
- Hurry, Evy!

1120
01:50:13,217 --> 01:50:15,136
- Hurry!
- You're not helping.

1121
01:50:22,643 --> 01:50:25,354
- Oh! I've got it.

1122
01:50:25,479 --> 01:50:29,400
Kadeesh mal.
Kadeesh mal.

1123
01:50:29,483 --> 01:50:32,028
Pared oos.
Pared oos.

1124
01:50:56,177 --> 01:50:59,680
I thought you said
it was gonna kill him!

1125
01:51:04,477 --> 01:51:07,146
Uh?

1126
01:51:07,271 --> 01:51:09,607
He's mortal.

1127
01:51:44,809 --> 01:51:46,727
"Death...

1128
01:51:46,811 --> 01:51:49,021
is only
the beginning."

1129
01:52:18,426 --> 01:52:20,595
- Time to go.
- Ohh!

1130
01:52:30,187 --> 01:52:32,064
You've lost the book!

1131
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:34,525
- Jonathan, I can't believe--
- Come on!

1132
01:53:03,221 --> 01:53:05,473
- Couldn't we just--
- No, Jonathan!

1133
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:14,190
O'Connell!

1134
01:53:17,151 --> 01:53:19,487
- O'Connell! Wait!
- Come on, come on.

1135
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:21,447
Wait! Please!

1136
01:53:21,572 --> 01:53:23,991
Come on, come on! Beni!

1137
01:53:24,075 --> 01:53:26,869
Good-bye, Beni.

1138
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:07,994
Go away.
Shoosh ma! Shoosh ma!

1139
01:54:18,796 --> 01:54:22,174
Aah! Shoosh ma!
Shoosh ma!

1140
01:54:24,302 --> 01:54:27,305
Shoosh ma!
Get away!

1141
01:54:37,899 --> 01:54:39,317
- Look out, look out!

1142
01:54:39,317 --> 01:54:42,153
- Look out, look out!

1143
01:54:42,278 --> 01:54:45,198
Aaah!

1144
01:55:24,153 --> 01:55:27,198
Aaah!

1145
01:55:27,323 --> 01:55:29,617
Oh! Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1146
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:33,538
You've earned the respect
and gratitude of me and my people.

1147
01:55:33,621 --> 01:55:36,666
Yes, well, it was nothing.

1148
01:55:36,791 --> 01:55:40,586
May Allah
smile upon you always.

1149
01:55:40,711 --> 01:55:43,172
And... yourself.

1150
01:55:48,177 --> 01:55:50,721
Yes, anytime.

1151
01:55:50,846 --> 01:55:52,974
Stay out of trouble.

1152
01:55:53,057 --> 01:55:55,810
He's just... leaving us here.

1153
01:56:00,189 --> 01:56:03,860
Well, I guess we go home
empty-handed... again.

1154
01:56:03,985 --> 01:56:06,362
I wouldn't say that.

1155
01:56:07,864 --> 01:56:10,992
Oh, please!

1156
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,003
How 'bout you, darling?
Would you like a little kissy-wissy?

1157
01:56:22,086 --> 01:56:24,005
- Whoo! Ohh.
