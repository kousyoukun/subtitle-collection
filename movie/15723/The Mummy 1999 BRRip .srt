1
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:09,895
Thebes: City of the Living.

2
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:13,730
Crownjewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

3
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:20,615
Home of lmhotep, Pharaoh's high priest.

4
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:23,285
Keeper of the Dead.

5
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,620
Birthplace ofAnck-su-namun,
Pharaoh's mistress.

6
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,040
No other man was allowed to touch her.

7
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:58,235
But for their love,
they were willing to risk life itself.

8
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,670
What are you doing here?

9
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:41,235
Who has touched you?

10
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,330
lmhotep!

11
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:52,330
My priest!

12
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,975
Pharaoh's bodyguards.

13
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,980
You must go! Save yourself!

14
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,815
-No.
-Only you can resurrect me!

15
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,610
l won't leave you!

16
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:24,110
Get away from me!

17
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:28,157
You shall live again!

18
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,452
l will resurrect you!

19
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:37,834
My body is no longer his temple!

20
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,596
To resurrect Anck-su-namun...

21
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:53,641
...lmhotep and his priests
broke into her crypt and stole her body.

22
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,436
They raced into the desert...

23
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,981
...taking Anck-su-namun's corpse
to Hamunaptra, City of the Dead...

24
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:01,316
HAMUNAPTRA - 1290 B.C.

25
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,776
...ancient burial site
for the sons ofpharaohs...

26
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,571
...and resting place for the wealth of Egypt.

27
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:14,662
For his love, lmhotep dared the gods' anger
by going deep into the city...

28
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:19,000
...where he took the black Book
of the Dead from its holy resting place.

29
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:24,214
Anck-su-namun's soul had been sent
to the dark underworld...

30
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:29,302
...her vital organs removed and placed
in fiive sacred canopicjars.

31
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:02,335
Anck-su-namun's soul
had come back from the dead.

32
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:06,464
But Pharaoh's bodyguards
had followed lmhotep and stopped him...

33
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:09,008
...before the ritual could be completed.

34
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:26,025
lmhotep's priests were condemned
to be mummifiied alive.

35
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,830
As for lmhotep...

36
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,791
...he was condemned
to endure the Hom-Dai...

37
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,502
...the worst of all ancient curses...

38
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:47,881
...one so horrible,
it had never before been bestowed.

39
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:30,715
He was to remain sealed
inside his sarcophagus...

40
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,635
...the undead for all of eternity.

41
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:37,138
The Magi would never allow him
to be released...

42
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:41,017
...for he would arise a walking disease,
a plague upon mankind...

43
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:44,562
...an unholy flesh-eater
with the strength of ages...

44
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,606
...power over the sands...

45
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,983
...and the glory of invincibility.

46
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,429
HAMUNAPTRA - 1923

47
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:25,603
For 3,000 years,
men and armies fought over this land...

48
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:29,107
...never knowing what evil lay beneath it.

49
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,125
And for 3,000 years...

50
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:52,005
...we, the Magi, the descendants of
Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards, kept watch.

51
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:08,313
You just got promoted.

52
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,696
Steady!

53
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,157
You're with me on this one, right?

54
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,409
Your strength gives me strength.

55
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:24,037
Steady!

56
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,543
Wait for me!

57
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,004
Steady!

58
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,552
Fire!

59
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:06,890
Run, Beni! Run!

60
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,434
Get inside! Get inside!

61
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,606
Don't you close that door!

62
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:16,733
Don't you close that door!

63
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:52,203
The Creature remains undiscovered.

64
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:56,165
And what of this one?

65
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,059
-Should we kill him?
-No.

66
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,145
The desert will kill him.

67
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,942
CAlRO, EGYPT
3 YEARS LATER

68
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,748
"Sacred Stones.

69
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,918
"Sculpture and Aesthetics.

70
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:46,174

"Tuthmosis"? What are you doing here?

T....

75
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:58,978
"T."

76
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,399
l'm going to put you where you belong.

77
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,125
Help.

78
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:52,282
What....

79
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,374
Look at this!

80
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,002
Sons of the pharaohs!

81
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:08,006
Give me frogs, flies, locusts...

82
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:10,925
...anything but you!

83
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,095
Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

84
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:16,681
l am so very sorry. lt was an accident.

85
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:21,102
When Ramses destroyed Syria,
that was an accident.

86
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:23,688
You...are a catastrophe!

87
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,899
Look at my library!

88
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,401
Why do l put up with you?

89
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,030
Well, you put up with me because l can....

90
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:34,824
l can read and write Ancient Egyptian...

91
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,703
...and l can decipher hieroglyphics
and hieratic...

92
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,915
...and l'm the only person
within a thousand miles...

93
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:45,501
...who knows how to properly code
and catalog this library, that's why.

94
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:49,172
l put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

95
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,840
That's why!

96
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,009
Allah rest their souls.

97
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,847
l don't care how you do it,
l don't care how long it takes.

98
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,266
Straighten up this meshiver!

99
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,531
Hello?

100
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,559
Abdul?

101
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,062
Mohammed?

102
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,358
Bob?

103
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,007
Have you no respect for the dead?

104
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,302
Of course l do!

105
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:20,430
But sometimes, l'd rather like to join them.

106
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,892
Do it soon before you ruin my career...

107
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:25,894
...the way you've ruined yours. Get out!

108
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:27,937
My dear, sweet baby sister...

109
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,523
...l'll have you know...

110
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,860
...that at this precise moment
my career is on a high note.

111
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:37,071
"High note." Please, l'm really not
in the mood for you.

112
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:39,616
l've just made a bit of a mess
in the library...

113
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,619
...and the Bembridge scholars
rejected my application again.

114
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,788
They say l don't have enough experience
in the field.

115
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:53,171
You'll always have me, old mum.

116
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,177
Besides, l have just the thing
to cheer you up.

117
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,597
No, Jonathan,
not another worthless trinket.

118
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:06,226
lf l have to take one more piece
of junk to the curator to try and...

119
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:07,810
...sell for you....

120
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:12,899
Where did you get this?

121
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,027
On a dig down in Thebes.

122
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:21,324
My whole life l've never found anything.
Please tell me l've found something.

123
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,038
-Jonathan.
-Yes?

124
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,875
l think you've found something.

125
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,464
See the cartouche.

126
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:39,884
lt's the official royal seal of Seti the First,
l'm sure of it.

127
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:41,719
-Perhaps.
-Two questions:

128
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:44,722
Who the hell was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

129
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:47,517
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty...

130
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,102
...the wealthiest pharaoh of all.

131
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:50,728
Good. l like this fellow.

132
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:53,106
-l like him a lot.
-l've already dated the map.

133
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:57,402
lt's almost 3,000 years old.
And if you look at the hieratic just here...

134
00:17:58,528 --> 00:17:59,779
...it's Hamunaptra.

135
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:02,115
Dear God, don't be ridiculous.

136
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,742
We're scholars, not treasure hunters.

137
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,954
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers...

138
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:09,831
...to amuse Greek and Roman tourists.

139
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:14,168
l know all the blather that the city
is protected by the curse of a mummy...

140
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:18,673
...but my research leads me to believe
that the city may have actually existed.

141
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:20,758
Do you mean the Hamunaptra?

142
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:22,802
Yes. The City of the Dead...

143
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,347
...where the pharaohs presumably hid
the wealth of Egypt.

144
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,058
Yes, in a big underground
treasure chamber.

145
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,478
Come on. Everybody knows the story.

146
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:35,940
The necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command.

147
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:39,819
Turn a switch and it would disappear
into the sand with the treasure.

148
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:42,989
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum--

149
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,575
My goodness! Look at that!

150
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,251
You've burnt the part with the lost city.

151
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,670
lt's for the best, l'm sure.

152
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:02,342
Many men have wasted their lives
in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra.

153
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:04,135
No one's ever found it.

154
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:06,971
Most have never returned.

155
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:09,515
Come! Step over the threshold.

156
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:12,852
Welcome to Cairo Prison,
my humble home.

157
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:15,521
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

158
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,357
-l was mistaken.
-You lied.

159
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,567
l lie to everybody. Why not to you?

160
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,945
-l'm your sister.
-Which makes you more gullible.

161
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,323
-You stole it from a drunk!
-Picked his pocket, actually.

162
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,492
Stop being ridiculous.

163
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:30,870
-Why exactly is this man in prison?
-This l did not know.

164
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,958
But when l heard you were coming,
l asked him that myself.

165
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,084
What did he say?

166
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,045
He said he was just looking
for a good time.

167
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,137
-This is the man that you stole it from?
-Yes, exactly.

168
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,599
-Why don't we go sniff out a spot of tiffin--
-Who are you?

169
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,103
-And who's the broad?
-"Broad"?

170
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:59,274
l'm just a local sort of missionary chap,
spreading the good word.

171
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:02,068
-This is my sister, Evy.
-How do you do?

172
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:05,905
-l guess she's not a total loss.
-l beg your pardon.

173
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,659
-l'll be right back.
-Ask him about the box.

174
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,037
We have found.... Hello. Excuse me.

175
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:16,291
We both found your puzzle box...

176
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,586
...and we've come to ask you about it.

177
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,672
-No.
-No.

178
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:25,967
You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

179
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,387
How do you know the box pertains
to Hamunaptra?

180
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,765
Because that's where l was
when l found it. l was there.

181
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:36,811
But how do we know
that's not a load of pig's wallow?

182
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:40,398
-Do l know you?
-No, l've just got one of those faces.

183
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,865
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

184
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:51,701
Yeah.

185
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,411
-You swear?
-Every damn day.

186
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:55,955
-l didn't mean that.
-l know. l was there.

187
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,333
Seti's place. City of the Dead.

188
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,295
Could you tell me how to get there?

189
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:07,550
l mean, the exact location.

190
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:10,261
-You want to know?
-Well, yes.

191
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:13,139
-Do you really want to know?
-Yes.

192
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:19,562
Then get me the hell out of here!

193
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,234
Do it, lady!

194
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:29,906
Where are they taking him?

195
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,241
To be hanged.

196
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,993
Apparently, he had a very good time.

197
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,252
l'll give you 100 pounds
to save this man's life.

198
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,630
Madam, l would pay 100 pounds
just to see him hang.

199
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,674
-200 pounds!
-Proceed!

200
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,801
300 pounds!

201
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:52,595
Any last requests, pig?

202
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:55,557
Yeah. Loosen the knot and let me go.

203
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,063
Of course we don't let him go!

204
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,775
500 pounds!

205
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:08,736
And what else?

206
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,030
l'm a very lonely man.

207
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:16,828
No!

208
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,004
His neck did not break!

209
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,259
l'm so sorry. Now we must
watch him strangle to death.

210
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:43,021
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

211
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,899
-You lie.
-l would never!

212
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:51,029
This filthy, godless son of a pig
knows where to find the City of the Dead?

213
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,614
-Yes!
-Truly?

214
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:55,867
And if you cut him down,
we will give you....

215
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,330
-Ten percent.
-Fifty percent.

216
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,123
-Twenty.
-Forty.

217
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,750
-Thirty!
-Twenty-five.

218
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,752
Deal.

219
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,214
Cut him down!

220
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,101
GlZA PORT - CAlRO

221
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:26,481
Do you really think he'll come?

222
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:28,691
Yes, undoubtedly, knowing my luck.

223
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,737
He may be a cowboy, but l know the breed.
His word is his word.

224
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,866
Personally, l think he's filthy,
rude, a complete scoundrel.

225
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,577
-l don't like him one bit.
-Anyone l know?

226
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:46,668
Hello.

227
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:49,712
Smashing day for the start
of an adventure, O'Connell?

228
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,130
Yeah, smashing.

229
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:55,176
No, l'd never steal from a partner, partner.

230
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:59,639
That reminds me,
no hard feelings about the....

231
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:02,308
-Happens all the time.
-Mr. O'Connell.

232
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,105
Can you look me in the eye and guarantee
this isn't some kind of a flimflam?

233
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,817
-Because if it is, l am warning you--
-You're warning me?

234
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:15,238
Let me put it this way, my whole
damn garrison believed in this so much...

235
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:19,284
...they marched across Libya
and into Egypt to find that city.

236
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,536
When we got there, all we found...

237
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,371
...was sand and blood.

238
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:26,249
Let me get your bags.

239
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:32,714
Yes, you're right.

240
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:36,968
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

241
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:40,722
Bright good morning to all.

242
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,057
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

243
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:46,728
l'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

244
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:11,544
Quit playing with your glasses
and cut the deck, Burns.

245
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:14,380
Without my glasses
l can't see the deck to cut it, Dave.

246
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:17,050
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

247
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:20,178
-l only gamble with my life, never money.
-Never?

248
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:24,140
What if l was to bet you $500
that we get to Hamunaptra before you?

249
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,268
-You're looking for Hamunaptra?
-Damn straight we are.

250
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:29,562
-And who says we are?
-He does.

251
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:33,024
Well, how about it?

252
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:34,484
ls it a bet?

253
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:39,781
-All right, you're on.
-What makes you so confident, sir?

254
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:43,409
-What makes you?
-We got a man who's actually been there.

255
00:25:43,493 --> 00:25:45,912
What a coincidence, because O'Connell--

256
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,915
Whose play is it? ls it my play?

257
00:25:49,374 --> 00:25:52,460
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

258
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,854
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

259
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,983
The only thing that scares me
are your manners.

260
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:17,694
Still angry about that kiss?

261
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,737
lf you call that a kiss.

262
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,245
Did l miss something?

263
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:29,873
Are we going into battle?

264
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,458
Lady, there's something out there.

265
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,253
Something underneath that sand.

266
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,298
l'm hoping to find a certain artifact.

267
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:39,674
A book, actually.

268
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:42,135
My brother thinks there's treasure.

269
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,680
-What do you think's out there?
-ln a word, evil.

270
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:49,809
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed.

271
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:53,605
Look, l don't believe in fairy tales
and hokum, Mr. O'Connell...

272
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,233
...but l think one of the most famous books
in history is buried there.

273
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,776
The Book ofAmun-Ra.

274
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,780
lt contains within it all the secret
incantations of the old kingdom.

275
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:05,700
lt's what first interested me in Egypt
when l was a child.

276
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:08,953
lt's why l came here, sort of a life's pursuit.

277
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:13,416
And the fact that they say it's made
of pure gold makes no never mind to you?

278
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,501
-Right?
-You know your history.

279
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,587
l know my treasure.

280
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:23,551
By the way...

281
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,137
...why did you kiss me?

282
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:29,307
l was about to be hanged.
lt seemed like a good idea.

283
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,939
What? What did l say?

284
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,865
What a surprise!
My good friend, you're alive!

285
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:48,034
l was so very, very worried.

286
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:50,787
Well, if it ain't my little buddy, Beni.

287
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:53,790
-l think l'll kill you.
-Think of my children.

288
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,792
You don't have any children.

289
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,710
-Someday l might.
-Shut up!

290
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:01,256
So you're the one who's leading
the Americans. l might have known.

291
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:05,760
So what's the scam? You take them
into the desert, and leave them to rot?

292
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:07,512
Unfortunately, no.

293
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:09,806
These Americans are smart.

294
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,559
They pay me half now,
half when we return to Cairo.

295
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:16,020
-So this time l must go all the way.
-Them's the breaks.

296
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:19,732
You never believed in Hamunaptra.

297
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:22,777
Why are you going back?

298
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,281
You see that girl?

299
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:28,241
She saved my neck.

300
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,373
You always did have more balls
than brains.

301
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,423
Good-bye, Beni.

302
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:51,097
O'Connell!

303
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,361
"George Bembridge...

304
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,906
"...in 1860....

305
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:13,411
"ln 1865 with...."

306
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,920
For heaven's sake, girl,
it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

307
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:37,936
Where is the map?

308
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:41,814
There.

309
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,400
And the key? Where is the key?

310
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:47,278
The key? What key?

311
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:07,090
The map! We forgot the map!

312
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:10,009
Relax. l'm the map. lt's all up here.

313
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:11,886
That's comforting.

314
00:30:20,144 --> 00:30:21,646
-The key!
-Evy?

315
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,627
Hold on to this.

316
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:14,782
Can you swim?

317
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,952
-l can swim if the occasion calls for it.
-Trust me.

318
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,996
lt calls for it.

319
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:44,520
O'Connell!

320
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,773
What are we going to do?

321
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:49,192
-Wait here! l'll go get help!
-Right!

322
00:32:11,756 --> 00:32:13,091
Americans.

323
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:30,358
l say, bloody good show, chaps!

324
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:33,403
And did l panic?

325
00:32:33,945 --> 00:32:35,363
l think not.

326
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:51,004
Get 'em out of the water!
Come on, dogies!

327
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:53,381
Give them a smack, would you!

328
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:58,511
This is a messed-up country.

329
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:03,016
We've lost everything!

330
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:05,518
All of our tools, all the equipment...

331
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,270
...all my clothes!

332
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,688
O'Connell!

333
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:16,863
lt looks to me like l've got all the horses!

334
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:18,990
Beni!

335
00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:23,203
lt looks to me like you're
on the wrong side of the river!

336
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:25,079
Yeah.

337
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,349
l only want four! Four!

338
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:47,769
l only want four, not a whole bloody herd!

339
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,730
Can you believe this cheat?

340
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:52,440
Just pay the man.

341
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:57,237
For heaven's sakes, can't believe the price
of these fleabags.

342
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:02,909
-Very good.
-You probably could've got them for free.

343
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:06,496
-You just had to give him your sister.
-Yes.

344
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:09,290
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

345
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,131
Awfully.

346
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:44,284
Never did like camels.

347
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:47,745
Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.

348
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:49,706
Disgusting.

349
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,791
l think they're adorable.

350
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:44,279
This one is strong.

351
00:36:54,956 --> 00:36:56,916
Good morning, my friend.

352
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,350
What are we doing?

353
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,769
Patience, my good barat'm. Patience.

354
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:21,316
Remember our bet, O'Connell?
First one to the city, $500 cash.

355
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:24,485
$100 is yours if you help us win that bet.

356
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:25,904
My pleasure.

357
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,031
O'Connell...

358
00:37:28,698 --> 00:37:30,074
...nice camel.

359
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:35,955
Get ready for it.

360
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:37,999
For what?

361
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,460
We're about to be shown the way.

362
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:55,141
Will you look at that?

363
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,185
Can you believe it?

364
00:37:57,685 --> 00:37:58,853
Hamunaptra.

365
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:00,730
Here we go again.

366
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,349
So long, Beni!

367
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:41,521
That serves you right.

368
00:39:07,422 --> 00:39:09,173
Go, Evy! Go!

369
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:53,134
Do they know something we don't?

370
00:39:53,968 --> 00:39:55,678
They are led by a woman.

371
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,555
What does a woman know?

372
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,515
That's a statue of Anubis.

373
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:01,768
lts legs go deep underground.

374
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:05,438
According to Bembridge scholars,
we'll find a secret compartment there...

375
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:08,066
...containing the golden Book ofAmun-Ra.

376
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:13,321
Jonathan, you're meant
to catch the sun with that.

377
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:17,492
What are these old mirrors for?

378
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:21,538
Ancient mirrors.
lt's an ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

379
00:40:23,581 --> 00:40:25,458
Here, this is for you.

380
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:30,880
Go ahead. lt's something l borrowed
off our American brethren.

381
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:33,299
l thought you might like it.
You might need it...

382
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:35,885
...for when you're....

383
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:38,805
What are you looking at?

384
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:50,066
Look for bugs.

385
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:51,734
l hate bugs.

386
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:56,322
We're standing inside a room
no one has entered in over 3,000 years.

387
00:40:57,699 --> 00:40:59,909
What is that God-awful stench?

388
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:12,088
"And then there was...

389
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:13,673
"...light."

390
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:17,260
Hey, that is a neat trick.

391
00:41:17,802 --> 00:41:20,179
-My God. lt's a Sah-Netjer.
-What?

392
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,432
-Preparation room.
-For what?

393
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:24,976
For entering the afterlife.

394
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:30,064
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

395
00:41:45,914 --> 00:41:47,207
What was that?

396
00:41:47,498 --> 00:41:49,876
Sounds like...bugs.

397
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:52,670
He said bugs.

398
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:55,340
What do you mean, bugs? l hate bugs.

399
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,942
The legs of Anubis.

400
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,155
The secret compartment should be hidden
somewhere inside here.

401
00:42:44,472 --> 00:42:46,641
You scared the bejesus out of us.

402
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:48,142
Likewise.

403
00:42:48,768 --> 00:42:51,145
-That's my tool kit.
-l don't think so.

404
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:52,480
Okay.

405
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:54,816
Perhaps l was mistaken.

406
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,112
Have a nice day, gentlemen.
We have a lot of work to do.

407
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:02,824
-Push off! This is our dig site.
-We got here first.

408
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:06,995
This here's our statue, friend.

409
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,164
l don't see your name written on it, pal.

410
00:43:10,373 --> 00:43:13,167
There's only four of you...

411
00:43:13,793 --> 00:43:15,253
...and 15 of me.

412
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:18,131
Your odds are not so great.

413
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:21,092
-l've had worse.
-Me, too.

414
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:26,055
For goodness' sake, let's be nice, children.

415
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,643
lf we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

416
00:43:32,645 --> 00:43:34,898
There are other places to dig.

417
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:43,197
According to these hieroglyphics
we're underneath the statue.

418
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:45,158
We should come up between his legs.

419
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:47,076
When those damn Yanks go to sleep...

420
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,703
-...no offense...
-None taken.

421
00:43:48,786 --> 00:43:51,247
...we'll dig up and steal the book
from under them.

422
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:53,833
Are you sure we can find
this secret compartment?

423
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:56,711
Yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

424
00:43:56,794 --> 00:43:58,463
-No offense.
-None taken.

425
00:43:58,546 --> 00:44:01,049
Where did our smelly little friend go to?

426
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:23,613
What have we here?

427
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:28,993
Blue gold.

428
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:33,581
This will fetch a mighty fine price.

429
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:48,346
-Let's get us some treasure!
-Careful!

430
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:50,932
Seti was no fool.

431
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:54,936
l think perhaps we should
let the diggers open it.

432
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:58,565
l think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

433
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:01,568
Yeah, sure. Let them open it.

434
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:29,012
So they ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars.

435
00:45:29,095 --> 00:45:32,724
They'd take out your heart as well.
Know how they took out your brains?

436
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:34,517
We don't need to know this.

437
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:38,062
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose...

438
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:41,774
...scramble things about a bit
and then rip it out through your nostrils.

439
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:42,901
That must hurt.

440
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:45,320
lt's mummification.
You're dead when they do it.

441
00:45:45,403 --> 00:45:49,282
lf l don't make it out of here,
don't put me down for mummification.

442
00:45:49,532 --> 00:45:50,825
Likewise.

443
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,794
Oh, my God. lt's a....

444
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:04,464
lt's a sarcophagus.

445
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,510
Buried at the base of Anubis.

446
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:14,557
He must have been someone
of great importance.

447
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:18,561
Or he did something very naughty.

448
00:46:21,898 --> 00:46:23,066
Allah.

449
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,863
One more.

450
00:46:49,384 --> 00:46:51,010
Help me! Help me!

451
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:12,699
Who is it?

452
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,620
"He That Shall Not Be Named."

453
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,294
This looks like some sort of a lock.

454
00:47:24,377 --> 00:47:27,755
-Whoever's in here sure wasn't getting out.
-No kidding.

455
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:31,134
lt'll take a month to crack
into this thing without a key.

456
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:32,385
A key?

457
00:47:33,177 --> 00:47:35,847
A key! That's what he was talking about!

458
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:38,683
-Who?
-The man on the barge.

459
00:47:38,808 --> 00:47:41,060
The one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

460
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:42,770
That's mine.

461
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:10,840
-What do you suppose killed him?
-Did you ever see him eat?

462
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:15,094
Seems that our American friends had
a little misfortune of their own today.

463
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:18,473
Three of their diggers were...melted.

464
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,266
-What?
-How?

465
00:48:20,892 --> 00:48:24,437
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.

466
00:48:24,854 --> 00:48:27,190
Some kind of ancient booby trap.

467
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:30,610
Maybe this place really is cursed.

468
00:48:34,113 --> 00:48:36,241
For goodness' sake, you two!

469
00:48:36,658 --> 00:48:38,743
-You don't believe in curses?
-No.

470
00:48:38,826 --> 00:48:42,997
l believe if l can see it and touch it,
it's real. That's what l believe.

471
00:48:43,122 --> 00:48:45,375
l believe in being prepared.

472
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,670
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

473
00:48:55,134 --> 00:48:56,427
What is it?

474
00:48:57,845 --> 00:48:59,222
A broken bottle.

475
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:02,225
Glenlivet. Twelve years old!

476
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:06,688
He may have been a stinky fellow,
but he had good taste.

477
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:11,943
Take this. Stay here.

478
00:49:12,277 --> 00:49:14,404
-No, wait! Wait for me.
-Evy!

479
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:18,741
Excuse me, but didn't the man
just say "stay here"? Evy!

480
00:49:22,495 --> 00:49:25,832
Mr. Henderson! Wake up!

481
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:27,185
Enough!

482
00:50:28,561 --> 00:50:31,606
We will shed no more blood,
but you must leave.

483
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:34,525
Leave this place or die.

484
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:37,362
You have one day.

485
00:51:01,135 --> 00:51:02,345
Evelyn.

486
00:51:07,475 --> 00:51:10,353
-Are you all right?
-Yes, l'm fine.

487
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,814
-You sure?
-Thank you.

488
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:16,693
That proves it. Old Seti's fortune
has got to be under this sand.

489
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,738
For them to protect it like this,
there's got to be treasure down there.

490
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:24,033
These men are desert people.
They value water, not gold.

491
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,121
You know, maybe just at night
we could combine forces?

492
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:32,917
Tough stuff, try a right hook.

493
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:36,004
Ball up your fist and put it up like that.

494
00:51:36,087 --> 00:51:37,755
Then mean it. Hit it here.

495
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,465
l mean it!

496
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,179
Okay, it's time for another drink.

497
00:51:45,763 --> 00:51:47,765
Unlike my brother, sir...

498
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:50,768
...l know when to say no.

499
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:55,607
And unlike your brother, miss...

500
00:51:55,857 --> 00:51:57,734
...you, l just don't get.

501
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:00,737
l know.

502
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:02,906
You're wondering...

503
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:07,660
...what is a place like me
doing in a girl like this.

504
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:09,871
Yeah, something like that.

505
00:52:09,954 --> 00:52:11,748
Egypt is in my blood.

506
00:52:12,665 --> 00:52:14,459
You see, my father...

507
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:18,421
...was a very, very famous explorer.

508
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:21,132
He loved Egypt so much...

509
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:24,344
...he married my mother,
who was an Egyptian...

510
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:27,347
...and quite an adventurer herself.

511
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:31,809
l get your father, and l get your mother...

512
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:33,269
...and...

513
00:52:34,604 --> 00:52:36,231
...l get him, but....

514
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:39,567
What are you doing here?

515
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:43,196
l may not be...

516
00:52:43,821 --> 00:52:45,323
...an explorer...

517
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:47,408
...or an adventurer...

518
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:50,870
...or a treasure seeker, or a gunfighter...

519
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:53,122
...Mr. O'Connell...

520
00:52:53,998 --> 00:52:58,211
...but l am proud of what l am.

521
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,797
And what is that?

522
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,215
l...

523
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:06,010
...am a librarian.

524
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:13,726
And l am going to kiss you...

525
00:53:13,893 --> 00:53:15,311
...Mr. O'Connell.

526
00:53:15,436 --> 00:53:16,938
Call me Rick.

527
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,736
Oh, Rick.

528
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,401
-There is a curse upon this chest.
-Curse, my ass.

529
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:05,904
-Who cares?
-Have a care, Mr. Henderson.

530
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:09,032
On these hallowed grounds,
that set forth in ancient times...

531
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:11,951
-...is as strong today as it was then.
-We understand.

532
00:54:12,035 --> 00:54:13,536
What's it say?

533
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:23,379
"Death will come on swift wings...

534
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:26,090
"...to whomsoever opens this chest."

535
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:39,729
We should not be here.

536
00:54:40,396 --> 00:54:41,940
This is not good.

537
00:54:42,232 --> 00:54:44,484
lt says, "There is one...

538
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:46,277
"...the undead...

539
00:54:46,361 --> 00:54:49,697
"...who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law...

540
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:51,783
"...to consummate this curse."

541
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:54,536
Let's not bring anyone back
from the dead then.

542
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:57,330
"He will kill all who open this chest...

543
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:01,000
"...and assimilate their organs and fluids...

544
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:04,963
"...and in so doing, he will regenerate...

545
00:55:05,213 --> 00:55:07,966
"...and no longer be the undead...

546
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:10,385
"...but a plague upon this earth."

547
00:55:12,428 --> 00:55:15,431
Well, we didn't come all this way
for nothing.

548
00:55:15,515 --> 00:55:17,517
-That's right.
-lt's the curse.

549
00:55:18,226 --> 00:55:19,769
lt's the curse.

550
00:55:19,852 --> 00:55:23,273
lt's the curse! Beware of the curse!

551
00:55:23,815 --> 00:55:25,024
Beware!

552
00:55:25,316 --> 00:55:27,485
Stupid superstitious bastard.

553
00:55:30,446 --> 00:55:33,116
l've dreamt about this
since l was a little girl.

554
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,534
You dream about dead guys?

555
00:55:34,617 --> 00:55:37,495
Look, the sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

556
00:55:37,912 --> 00:55:41,291
This man must've been condemned
both in this life and the next.

557
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:43,543
-Tough break.
-Yeah, l'm all tears.

558
00:55:43,626 --> 00:55:47,088
Now, let's see who's inside. Shall we?

559
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:00,184
l hate it when these things do that.

560
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:01,811
ls he supposed to look like that?

561
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:04,355
l've never seen a mummy
look like this before.

562
00:56:04,439 --> 00:56:05,899
He's still....

563
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,068
-Juicy.
-Yes.

564
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:12,405
He must be more than 3,000 years old...

565
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:15,658
...and it looks as if he's still...

566
00:56:15,742 --> 00:56:17,160
...decomposing.

567
00:56:18,786 --> 00:56:20,246
Look at that.

568
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,042
What do you make of this?

569
00:56:24,334 --> 00:56:26,544
These marks were made with...

570
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,088
...fingernails.

571
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:32,508
This man was buried alive.

572
00:56:34,302 --> 00:56:36,179
And he left a message.

573
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:40,350
"Death is only the beginning."

574
00:56:59,577 --> 00:57:00,912
Oh, my God.

575
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:03,331
lt does exist.

576
00:57:04,374 --> 00:57:06,626
-The Book of the Dead.
-A book?

577
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,921
Who cares about a book?
Where the hell's the treasure?

578
00:57:10,004 --> 00:57:11,673
This, gentlemen...

579
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,926
...this is treasure.

580
00:57:16,636 --> 00:57:19,138
l wouldn't trade you for a brass--

581
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:23,184
Look at that.

582
00:57:25,103 --> 00:57:27,272
There's your treasure, gentlemen.

583
00:57:27,397 --> 00:57:29,357
Now we're onto something.

584
00:57:45,415 --> 00:57:48,167
l believe you need a key to open that book.

585
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:53,923
What do you think
these will fetch back home?

586
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:57,010
We hear you boys found yourselves a nice,
gooey mummy.

587
00:57:57,093 --> 00:57:58,219
Congratulations.

588
00:57:58,303 --> 00:58:02,265
lf you dry that fella out,
you might be able to sell him for firewood.

589
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:04,309
Look what l found.

590
00:58:04,392 --> 00:58:05,894
You're in her seat.

591
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,186
-Now!
-Yes.

592
00:58:07,437 --> 00:58:09,731
Scarab skeletons, flesh-eaters.

593
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:13,109
l found them inside our friend's coffin.

594
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:17,113
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

595
00:58:17,322 --> 00:58:21,367
Too bad for our friend, he was still alive
when they started eating him.

596
00:58:21,826 --> 00:58:26,080
So somebody threw these in with our guy,
and then they slowly ate him alive?

597
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:27,624
Very slowly.

598
00:58:27,957 --> 00:58:30,960
He sure wasn't a popular guy
when they planted him.

599
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:35,089
He probably got a little too frisky
with the Pharaoh's daughter.

600
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:37,383
According to my readings...

601
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:41,679
...our friend suffered the Hom-Dai,
the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses...

602
00:58:41,763 --> 00:58:44,807
...one reserved only
for the most evil of blasphemers.

603
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:48,228
l've never heard of this curse
having actually been performed.

604
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:50,480
-That bad?
-Yes, well, they....

605
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,566
They never used it
because they feared it so.

606
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:57,737
lt's written that if a victim
of the Hom-Dai should ever arise...

607
00:58:58,321 --> 00:59:01,491
...he would bring with him
the ten plagues of Egypt.

608
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:34,566
That's called stealing, you know.

609
00:59:34,691 --> 00:59:36,776
According to you and my brother...

610
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:38,736
...it's called borrowing.

611
00:59:41,197 --> 00:59:43,783
l thought the Book ofAmun-Ra
was made out of gold.

612
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:47,328
lt is made out of gold.
This isn't the Book ofAmun-Ra.

613
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,998
This is something else.

614
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:53,126
l think this may be the Book of the Dead.

615
00:59:53,835 --> 00:59:55,378
The Book of the Dead?

616
00:59:55,753 --> 00:59:57,672
Should you be playing around with it?

617
00:59:57,755 --> 01:00:01,301
lt's just a book. No harm ever came from...

618
01:00:02,176 --> 01:00:03,720
...reading a book.

619
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:11,561
That happens a lot around here.

620
01:00:14,272 --> 01:00:15,523
What's it say?

621
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:18,776
"Amun-Ra. Amun-Dei."

622
01:00:19,694 --> 01:00:22,071
lt speaks of the night and of the day.

623
01:00:36,419 --> 01:00:37,420
No!

624
01:00:37,921 --> 01:00:40,006
You must not read from the book!

625
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:07,951
Run!

626
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:11,871
Go, go!

627
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:22,131
What have we done?

628
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:25,385
Where'd they come from?

629
01:01:25,468 --> 01:01:27,679
l ain't waiting around to find out.

630
01:01:31,224 --> 01:01:33,393
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

631
01:01:33,726 --> 01:01:35,436
Leave me! Leave me!

632
01:01:38,147 --> 01:01:40,275
Could you help me find my--

633
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:45,488
Wait for me!

634
01:02:09,095 --> 01:02:10,305
Who's there?

635
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:14,350
Who's there?

636
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:29,782
Daniels?

637
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:03,191
Scarabs!

638
01:03:03,608 --> 01:03:06,527
-Run, Evy!
-Go, go! Run!

639
01:03:38,476 --> 01:03:39,936
-Evelyn?
-Evy?

640
01:03:56,411 --> 01:03:57,787
Mr. Burns. Thank goodness.

641
01:03:57,871 --> 01:03:59,998
l was just starting to get scared.

642
01:04:00,248 --> 01:04:02,208
l've lost everyone. l--

643
01:04:03,418 --> 01:04:06,212
My eyes. My eyes.

644
01:04:27,942 --> 01:04:29,444
Please help me.

645
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:33,865
He took my tongue.

646
01:04:34,282 --> 01:04:36,117
Please don't leave me.

647
01:04:39,204 --> 01:04:40,705
Anck-su-namun?

648
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:43,291
Damn it! lt's a trapdoor.

649
01:04:43,374 --> 01:04:46,044
There must be a switch
around here someplace.

650
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,214
Run, you sons of bitches! Run!

651
01:04:49,547 --> 01:04:50,548
Go.

652
01:05:03,853 --> 01:05:05,063
Go! Go!

653
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,697
Come with me
my Princess Anck-su-namun.

654
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:18,910
There you are! Stop playing hide-and-seek.

655
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:20,870
Let's get out of here.

656
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:23,498
Evy!

657
01:05:36,135 --> 01:05:38,346
-Move!
-Did you see that?

658
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:40,848
lt was walking. lt was walking!

659
01:05:50,775 --> 01:05:53,945
l told you to leave or die. You refused.

660
01:05:55,113 --> 01:05:57,031
Now you may have killed us all.

661
01:05:57,115 --> 01:06:00,285
You have unleashed a creature
we have feared for 3,000 years.

662
01:06:00,368 --> 01:06:03,872
-Relax. l got him.
-No mortal weapon can kill this creature.

663
01:06:03,997 --> 01:06:05,874
He's not of this world.

664
01:06:14,382 --> 01:06:16,342
-You bastards.
-What did you do to him?

665
01:06:16,426 --> 01:06:20,346
We saved him before the creature
could finish his work.

666
01:06:21,014 --> 01:06:24,183
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

667
01:06:27,562 --> 01:06:30,648
We must now hunt him
and find a way to kill him.

668
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:33,359
l already told you l got him.

669
01:06:36,029 --> 01:06:37,363
Know this.

670
01:06:38,114 --> 01:06:40,491
This creature is the bringer of death.

671
01:06:40,825 --> 01:06:43,369
He will never eat, he will never sleep...

672
01:06:43,786 --> 01:06:45,663
...and he will never stop.

673
01:07:18,696 --> 01:07:21,491
May the good Lord protect
and watch over me...

674
01:07:22,116 --> 01:07:24,661
...as a shepherd watches over his flock.

675
01:07:38,132 --> 01:07:40,218
No? Okay.

676
01:07:59,487 --> 01:08:01,447
The language of the slaves...

677
01:08:03,408 --> 01:08:05,827
...l may have use for you.

678
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:09,706
And the rewards...

679
01:08:10,957 --> 01:08:12,542
...will be great.

680
01:08:15,378 --> 01:08:16,713
My prince.

681
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:22,677
Where are the other sacredjars?

682
01:08:42,155 --> 01:08:44,032
FORT BRYDON, CAlRO

683
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:54,209
l thought you said
you didn't believe in fairy tales.

684
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:58,880
Encountering a 3,000-year-old walking,
talking corpse...

685
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:00,340
...tends to convert one.

686
01:09:00,423 --> 01:09:03,718
Forget it. We're out the door,
down the hall and we're gone.

687
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:06,888
-No, we are not.
-Yes, we are.

688
01:09:06,971 --> 01:09:09,474
No. We woke him up,
and we are going to stop him.

689
01:09:09,557 --> 01:09:11,601
What "we"? "We" didn't read that book.

690
01:09:11,684 --> 01:09:14,437
l told you not to play around
with that thing. Didn't l?

691
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,690
Yes, then me. l woke him up
and l intend to stop him.

692
01:09:18,691 --> 01:09:21,945
How? You heard the man.
No mortal weapons can kill this guy.

693
01:09:22,028 --> 01:09:25,156
Then we are just going to have
to find some immortal ones.

694
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,244
-There goes that "we" again.
-Will you listen to me? We have to do--

695
01:09:29,702 --> 01:09:33,581
Once this creature is reborn his curse
will spread till the earth is destroyed.

696
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:36,543
-ls that my problem?
-lt is everybody's problem.

697
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:39,712
l appreciate you saving my life
but when l signed on...

698
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:42,590
...l agreed to take you out there
and to bring you back.

699
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:44,717
l've done that. End of job. End of story.

700
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:47,262
-Contract terminated.
-That's all l mean to you?

701
01:09:47,345 --> 01:09:49,180
You can either tag along with me...

702
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:52,392
...or you can stay here
and try and save the world!

703
01:09:52,642 --> 01:09:54,769
-What's it gonna be?
-l'm staying.

704
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:56,271
-Fine!
-Fine.

705
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,951
l'm the last of the Royal Air Force
still stationed out here, you know.

706
01:10:10,285 --> 01:10:13,037
Some bloody idiot spilled his drink.

707
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:16,916
All the other laddies died in the sky
and were buried in the sand.

708
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:19,627
Good chaps, every one of them, too.

709
01:10:19,961 --> 01:10:21,212
Hi, Winston.

710
01:10:22,672 --> 01:10:23,715
You know, O'Connell...

711
01:10:23,798 --> 01:10:29,095
...ever since the end of the Great War,
there hasn't been a single challenge...

712
01:10:29,554 --> 01:10:31,431
...worthy of a man like me.

713
01:10:31,723 --> 01:10:34,058
Yeah? We all got
our little problems today.

714
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:37,353
l just wish l could have chucked it in
with the others...

715
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:39,772
...and gone down in flame and glory...

716
01:10:40,023 --> 01:10:44,152
...instead of sitting around here
rotting of boredom and booze.

717
01:10:44,235 --> 01:10:45,445
Cheers.

718
01:10:49,157 --> 01:10:50,950
Back to the airfield.

719
01:10:52,577 --> 01:10:54,996
-Has your sister always been--
-Yes, always.

720
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:58,082
We're all packed,
but the boat doesn't leave till tomorrow.

721
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,543
Tail set firmly between your legs, l see.

722
01:11:00,627 --> 01:11:04,297
You don't have a sacred walking corpse
after you.

723
01:11:06,049 --> 01:11:07,717
How's your friend?

724
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,805
He had his eyes and his tongue ripped out.
How would you be?

725
01:11:13,848 --> 01:11:15,975
l'm so pleased...

726
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:18,186
...to meet you.

727
01:11:18,645 --> 01:11:21,397
Prince lmhotep does not like to be touched.

728
01:11:21,564 --> 01:11:24,400
A silly Eastern superstition, l'm afraid.

729
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:27,153
Please forgive me.

730
01:11:31,574 --> 01:11:32,992
Mr. Burns...

731
01:11:33,117 --> 01:11:36,162
...Prince lmhotep thanks you
for your hospitality.

732
01:11:38,498 --> 01:11:40,291
And for your eyes.

733
01:11:41,459 --> 01:11:43,211
And for your tongue.

734
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,714
But l am afraid more is needed.

735
01:11:47,632 --> 01:11:49,801
The Prince must finish the job...

736
01:11:50,134 --> 01:11:53,555
...and consummate the curse
which you and your friends...

737
01:11:53,763 --> 01:11:57,392
-...have brought down upon yourselves.
-Wait! No!

738
01:12:01,145 --> 01:12:02,730
Good luck, boys.

739
01:12:07,902 --> 01:12:11,364
Sweet Jesus! Tasted just like....

740
01:12:12,865 --> 01:12:14,033
Blood.

741
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:17,245
"And the rivers and waters
of Egypt ran red...

742
01:12:18,288 --> 01:12:20,248
"...and were as blood."

743
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:23,585
He's here.

744
01:12:29,966 --> 01:12:33,344
-Evelyn!
-So you're still here.

745
01:12:33,887 --> 01:12:35,638
We've got problems.

746
01:13:00,205 --> 01:13:03,041
Beni, you little stinkweed.
Where you been?

747
01:13:28,483 --> 01:13:30,318
We are in serious trouble.

748
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,963
You saved me from the undead.

749
01:13:50,129 --> 01:13:51,506
l thank you.

750
01:14:08,022 --> 01:14:10,316
We are in very serious trouble.

751
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,071
-He seems to like Evy.
-What's that about?

752
01:14:15,154 --> 01:14:18,783
-What's this guy want?
-Only one person can give us any answers.

753
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:22,328
-You!
-Miss Carnahan.

754
01:14:22,912 --> 01:14:25,039
-Gentlemen.
-What is he doing here?

755
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:29,460
Do you really want to know,
or would you prefer to just shoot us?

756
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:31,254
After what l just saw...

757
01:14:31,546 --> 01:14:33,548
...l'm willing to go on faith.

758
01:14:33,673 --> 01:14:36,259
We are part of an ancient secret society.

759
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:39,762
For over 3,000 years
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

760
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:45,852
We are sworn at manhood to do all to stop
the High Priest lmhotep from being reborn.

761
01:14:46,144 --> 01:14:47,645
Because of you, we have failed.

762
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:50,273
Does this justify killing innocent people?

763
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,151
To stop this creature? Let me think. Yes!

764
01:14:55,528 --> 01:14:57,780
Question: Why doesn't he like cats?

765
01:14:58,197 --> 01:15:02,243
They're guardians of the underworld.
He'll fear them till he's fully regenerated.

766
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:05,330
-Then he will fear nothing.
-You know how he regenerates?

767
01:15:05,413 --> 01:15:09,375
-By killing everyone who opened the chest.
-And sucking them dry!

768
01:15:09,751 --> 01:15:11,544
Stop playing with that.

769
01:15:12,003 --> 01:15:16,883
When l saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-su-namun.

770
01:15:18,927 --> 01:15:22,013
And now, in Mr. Burns' quarters,
he tried to kiss me.

771
01:15:22,096 --> 01:15:25,141
lt's because of his love for Anck-su-namun
that he was cursed.

772
01:15:25,225 --> 01:15:27,894
-Even after 3,000 years--
-He's still in love with her.

773
01:15:27,977 --> 01:15:30,647
That's very romantic,
but what's it got to do with me?

774
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:34,025
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

775
01:15:34,108 --> 01:15:37,403
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.

776
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,908
Bad luck, old mum.

777
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:46,412
On the contrary, it may just give us
the time we need to kill the creature.

778
01:15:47,622 --> 01:15:52,418
We will need all the help we can get.
His powers are growing.

779
01:15:57,882 --> 01:16:01,344
"And he stretched forth
his hand towards the heavens...

780
01:16:01,469 --> 01:16:04,764
"...and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt."

781
01:16:06,224 --> 01:16:07,892
We must stop him from regenerating.

782
01:16:07,976 --> 01:16:10,603
-Who opened that chest?
-Me and Daniels.

783
01:16:11,145 --> 01:16:13,064
-And Burns.
-And that Egyptologist.

784
01:16:13,147 --> 01:16:16,568
-What about my buddy Beni?
-He scrammed before we opened it.

785
01:16:16,651 --> 01:16:19,696
-Yeah, he was the smart one.
-That sounds like Beni.

786
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:23,032
We must find the Egyptologist
and return him to safety...

787
01:16:23,116 --> 01:16:25,410
-...before the creature can get to him.
-Right.

788
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:28,663
-She stays here. You three, come with me.
-Not me!

789
01:16:29,455 --> 01:16:32,625
You can't leave me behind
like some old carpetbag.

790
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:36,379
Who put you in charge?
What do you think you are doing?

791
01:16:36,462 --> 01:16:40,049
-Jonathan! O'Connell!
-Sorry, but he's a bit...tall.

792
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:43,177
You are not leaving me in here!

793
01:16:44,012 --> 01:16:46,890
lf you don't open this door
in one minute flat....

794
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:49,058
This door doesn't open.

795
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:52,061
-She doesn't come out, and no one goes in.
-Right.

796
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,022
-Right?
-Right.

797
01:16:54,314 --> 01:16:56,649
O'Connell! Jonathan!

798
01:16:56,733 --> 01:16:57,775
Let's go.

799
01:16:58,484 --> 01:17:00,945
l thought l could stay at the fort
and reconnoiter.

800
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:04,699
-Now!
-We're just gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

801
01:17:39,484 --> 01:17:41,736
Let me guess...spring cleaning?

802
01:17:45,657 --> 01:17:46,991
Nice shot.

803
01:17:47,909 --> 01:17:50,870
Beni, did you fall down?
Let me help you up.

804
01:17:53,373 --> 01:17:56,918
You came back from the desert
with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

805
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:59,295
What friend? You are my only friend.

806
01:18:01,923 --> 01:18:05,677
What the hell are you doing
with this creep? What's in it for you?

807
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,847
lt is better to be the right hand
of the devil than to be in his path.

808
01:18:09,931 --> 01:18:12,475
As long as l serve him, l am immune.

809
01:18:16,771 --> 01:18:18,439
lmmune from what?

810
01:18:19,816 --> 01:18:23,486
-What did you say?
-l don't wanna tell you. You'll hurt me.

811
01:18:23,778 --> 01:18:27,031
What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

812
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:31,536
The black book they found at Hamunaptra.
He wants it back.

813
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:33,955
He said it would be worth its weight
in gold.

814
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:36,749
-What does he want the book for?
-l don't know.

815
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,545
Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

816
01:18:40,628 --> 01:18:43,089
But that's all.
He just wants the book, l swear.

817
01:18:43,172 --> 01:18:46,342
Just the book, l swear. And your sister.

818
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:48,386
But other than that--

819
01:19:38,895 --> 01:19:40,438
That's two down, two to go.

820
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:42,565
Then he'll be coming after Evy.

821
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:45,735
Guards in place! Reporting all clear, sir!

822
01:19:46,152 --> 01:19:47,737
To hell with this.

823
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,907
l'm going downstairs to get a drink.
You want something?

824
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,326
-Get me a glass of bourbon.
-All right.

825
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,620
-And a shot of bourbon.
-Yeah, okay.

826
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:58,206
-And a bourbon chaser.
-l'll get your damn bourbon!

827
01:19:58,289 --> 01:20:00,416
Don't worry about the door.

828
01:21:40,308 --> 01:21:41,809
Anck-su-namun.

829
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:55,865
Get your ugly face off of her!

830
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:01,079
Look what l got.

831
01:22:18,096 --> 01:22:19,347
You all right?

832
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:21,641
l'm not sure.

833
01:22:31,901 --> 01:22:35,905
According to legend, the black book
found by the Americans at Hamunaptra...

834
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:37,824
...can bring people back from the dead.

835
01:22:37,907 --> 01:22:40,577
-Until now l did not believe it.
-Believe it.

836
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:42,871
That's what brought our buddy back to life.

837
01:22:42,954 --> 01:22:46,165
lf the black book can bring dead people
to life....

838
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:49,878
-Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
-That's the myth.

839
01:22:50,169 --> 01:22:53,006
Now we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

840
01:22:53,089 --> 01:22:55,717
lmhotep. lmhotep.

841
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:21,326
Last but not least, my favorite plague...
boils and sores.

842
01:23:21,534 --> 01:23:23,661
They have become his slaves.

843
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:26,706
So it has begun, the beginning of the end.

844
01:23:27,207 --> 01:23:29,584
Not quite yet. Come on.

845
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:55,735
Bembridge scholars said
the golden Book ofAmun-Ra...

846
01:23:55,818 --> 01:23:57,445
...was inside the statue of Anubis.

847
01:23:57,528 --> 01:23:59,822
-That's where we found the black book.
-Exactly.

848
01:23:59,906 --> 01:24:03,409
-The old boys at Bembridge were wrong.
-They mixed the books up.

849
01:24:03,493 --> 01:24:05,203
Mixed up where they were buried.

850
01:24:05,286 --> 01:24:08,289
So if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis...

851
01:24:08,373 --> 01:24:10,917
...then the golden book must be inside....

852
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:19,592
-Come on, Evy. Faster.
-Patience is a virtue.

853
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:22,845
Not right now it isn't.

854
01:24:22,929 --> 01:24:25,265
l think l'll go and get the car started.

855
01:24:25,348 --> 01:24:27,892
l've got it. The Book ofAmun-Ra is at...

856
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:30,520
...Hamunaptra inside the statue of Horus.

857
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,022
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

858
01:24:42,323 --> 01:24:44,492
lmhotep.

859
01:25:02,468 --> 01:25:04,220
Let's go, let's go!

860
01:25:06,222 --> 01:25:08,308
-Get it in gear.
-Let's get out of here.

861
01:25:08,391 --> 01:25:10,768
-Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
-lmhotep!

862
01:25:19,527 --> 01:25:22,322
You're gonna get yours, Beni!
You hear me?

863
01:25:22,822 --> 01:25:27,035
-You're gonna get yours!
-Like l've never heard that before!

864
01:25:57,607 --> 01:25:58,816
Hang on!

865
01:27:32,744 --> 01:27:34,204
Okay! Go, go!

866
01:27:42,712 --> 01:27:45,423
lmhotep. lmhotep.

867
01:27:58,478 --> 01:28:00,063
lt's the creature.

868
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:02,732
He's fully regenerated.

869
01:28:08,154 --> 01:28:09,948
"Come with me, my princess.

870
01:28:10,448 --> 01:28:13,076
"lt is time to make you mine forever."

871
01:28:13,952 --> 01:28:15,954
"For all eternity," idiot.

872
01:28:22,085 --> 01:28:23,419
"Take my hand...

873
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:25,713
"...and l will spare your friends."

874
01:28:26,631 --> 01:28:27,882
Oh, dear.

875
01:28:30,385 --> 01:28:33,096
-Have you got any bright ideas?
-l'm thinking.

876
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:36,432
You better think fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy...

877
01:28:36,516 --> 01:28:39,018
...you're the first one l'm coming after.

878
01:28:42,981 --> 01:28:44,357
-No.
-Don't!

879
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:47,610
He must take me to Hamunaptra
to perform the ritual.

880
01:28:47,694 --> 01:28:50,822
She is right. Live today, fight tomorrow.

881
01:29:02,834 --> 01:29:04,836
l'll be seeing you again.

882
01:29:11,676 --> 01:29:12,886
Evelyn!

883
01:29:15,763 --> 01:29:17,265
That's mine.

884
01:29:17,765 --> 01:29:18,892
Thank you.

885
01:29:20,226 --> 01:29:21,477
Kill them all!

886
01:29:21,644 --> 01:29:23,271
No! Let go of me!

887
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,189
Let go of me!

888
01:29:25,356 --> 01:29:27,150
Good-bye, my friend.

889
01:29:27,233 --> 01:29:28,985
Come here, you little....

890
01:29:37,493 --> 01:29:38,703
Come on!

891
01:29:38,828 --> 01:29:42,207
-What about my sister?
-We're gonna get her back! Go!

892
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,917
You're next!

893
01:29:45,418 --> 01:29:47,420
Come on! Give me your hand!

894
01:30:23,623 --> 01:30:26,334
'Morning, Winston. A word?

895
01:30:27,961 --> 01:30:31,756
What's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

896
01:30:31,839 --> 01:30:33,466
Not a damn thing.

897
01:30:35,468 --> 01:30:37,762
-ls it dangerous?
-You might not live through it.

898
01:30:37,845 --> 01:30:39,806
By Jove, do you really think so?

899
01:30:39,889 --> 01:30:42,934
Everybody else we've run into has died.
Why not you?

900
01:30:43,768 --> 01:30:44,978
What's the challenge then?

901
01:30:45,061 --> 01:30:48,856
Rescue the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy and save the world.

902
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,944
Winston Havelock at your service, sir.

903
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:05,957
Are you all right?

904
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,127
Do l bloody look all right?

905
01:31:13,464 --> 01:31:14,966
How you doing?

906
01:31:24,726 --> 01:31:28,479
You see that? l've never seen one so big.

907
01:31:29,022 --> 01:31:30,732
-Never?
-No!

908
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:46,831
Get off of me! Get off!

909
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:50,460
l need a new job.

910
01:32:11,397 --> 01:32:12,398
My God.

911
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:14,776
We're back.

912
01:32:27,413 --> 01:32:28,748
O'Connell.

913
01:32:41,761 --> 01:32:43,179
My God.

914
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:47,141
Winston!

915
01:32:47,225 --> 01:32:48,893
Paddle faster.

916
01:32:51,604 --> 01:32:53,064
Hang on, men!

917
01:33:36,858 --> 01:33:38,902
Stop it! You'll kill them!

918
01:33:39,068 --> 01:33:40,653
That's the idea.

919
01:33:56,211 --> 01:33:58,004
Here l come, laddies!

920
01:34:25,865 --> 01:34:29,410
l loved the whole sand-wall trick.
lt was beautiful.

921
01:34:29,494 --> 01:34:31,496
Bastard.

922
01:34:47,845 --> 01:34:49,180
Excuse me.

923
01:34:51,891 --> 01:34:56,145
A little help would be useful,
if it's not too much trouble!

924
01:34:57,981 --> 01:34:59,399
Yeah. All right.

925
01:35:05,572 --> 01:35:06,781
Winston!

926
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:25,800
Quicksand! Get back! lt's quicksand.

927
01:36:14,015 --> 01:36:15,433
Keep moving!

928
01:36:16,935 --> 01:36:21,064
Nasty little fellows such as yourself
always get their comeuppance.

929
01:36:23,775 --> 01:36:24,984
-They do?
-Yes.

930
01:36:26,486 --> 01:36:27,695
Always.

931
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:36,913
Take those bigger stones first.

932
01:36:37,705 --> 01:36:40,667
Take them from the top,
or everything will cave in on us.

933
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:43,086
Come on. Put your backs into it.

934
01:36:45,672 --> 01:36:47,757
You've got the idea. Chop-chop.

935
01:36:56,474 --> 01:36:57,642
l say!

936
01:37:01,145 --> 01:37:03,940
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

937
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:13,074
What?

938
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:15,827
lt's in my arm! My arm!

939
01:37:19,998 --> 01:37:21,207
Hold him!

940
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:24,377
Do something! Do something!
Not that! Not that!

941
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:36,014
O'Connell.

942
01:38:02,081 --> 01:38:04,792
The Bembridge scholars
never wrote about this.

943
01:38:09,881 --> 01:38:11,216
Let go of me.

944
01:38:12,842 --> 01:38:14,010
Kill them...

945
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:17,055
...and wake the others.

946
01:39:21,619 --> 01:39:23,204
-Can you see....
-Yeah.

947
01:39:23,288 --> 01:39:25,290
-Can you believe....
-Yeah.

948
01:39:25,832 --> 01:39:27,584
-Can we just....
-No.

949
01:39:38,595 --> 01:39:41,222
-Who the hell are these guys?
-Priests.

950
01:39:42,181 --> 01:39:43,850
lmhotep's priests.

951
01:39:43,933 --> 01:39:45,476
All right then.

952
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:34,817
There he is!

953
01:40:35,735 --> 01:40:37,612
Hello, Horus, old boy.

954
01:40:47,372 --> 01:40:49,290
Time to close the door.

955
01:41:29,414 --> 01:41:30,915
Anck-su-namun.

956
01:41:40,258 --> 01:41:43,261
O'Connell! Jonathan!

957
01:41:54,856 --> 01:41:57,650
Damn, these guys just don't quit, do they?

958
01:41:57,859 --> 01:41:59,319
Keep digging.

959
01:42:23,176 --> 01:42:24,928
The Book ofAmun-Ra.

960
01:42:33,269 --> 01:42:34,771
Save the girl.

961
01:42:34,896 --> 01:42:36,522
Kill the creature.

962
01:42:48,535 --> 01:42:51,913
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

963
01:43:00,421 --> 01:43:02,173
You all right? Let's go.

964
01:43:51,556 --> 01:43:54,350
With your death, Anck-su-namun shall live.

965
01:43:54,809 --> 01:43:57,562
And l shall be invincible!

966
01:43:58,313 --> 01:44:00,231
The Book ofAmun-Ra! l found it, Evy!

967
01:44:00,732 --> 01:44:02,525
The Book ofAmun-Ra.

968
01:44:03,026 --> 01:44:05,653
Shut up and get me off here, Jonathan!

969
01:44:06,237 --> 01:44:09,198
Open the book.
lt's the only way to kill him.

970
01:44:09,908 --> 01:44:12,911
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

971
01:44:12,994 --> 01:44:15,914
l can't open it! lt's locked.

972
01:44:18,208 --> 01:44:21,211
-We need the key, Evy!
-lt's inside his robes.

973
01:45:01,668 --> 01:45:02,710
Mummies.

974
01:45:14,681 --> 01:45:16,849
Look out! There's one....

975
01:45:42,917 --> 01:45:44,794
Here's an inscription.

976
01:46:13,865 --> 01:46:16,451
This keeps getting better and better.

977
01:46:16,868 --> 01:46:18,536
-Do something.
-Me?

978
01:46:18,912 --> 01:46:21,789
-You can command them.
-You have got to be joking.

979
01:46:21,873 --> 01:46:25,793
Finish the inscription on the cover, idiot,
then you can control them.

980
01:46:26,669 --> 01:46:27,712
Right.

981
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:06,793
Hurry up, Jonathan!

982
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:42,245
-l can't figure out this last symbol.
-What does it look like?

983
01:47:56,509 --> 01:47:59,846
lt's a bird, a stork!

984
01:48:12,817 --> 01:48:14,193
Ahmenophus!

985
01:48:16,362 --> 01:48:17,739
Yes, l see.

986
01:48:49,062 --> 01:48:50,438
Destroy him!

987
01:48:53,816 --> 01:48:55,735
l command you to destroy him!

988
01:49:03,952 --> 01:49:05,453
Anck-su-namun!

989
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:11,626
Give me that book!

990
01:49:25,807 --> 01:49:27,141
Now you die.

991
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:47,579
Evy! l've got it.

992
01:49:52,917 --> 01:49:54,419
Keep him busy.

993
01:49:58,256 --> 01:49:59,632
No problem.

994
01:50:12,145 --> 01:50:13,062
Hurry, Evy!

995
01:50:13,146 --> 01:50:15,273
-Hurry!
-You're not helping.

996
01:50:18,651 --> 01:50:21,154
Now it's your turn.

997
01:50:24,824 --> 01:50:25,992
l've got it.

998
01:50:56,231 --> 01:50:59,025
l thought you said it was gonna kill him!

999
01:51:08,451 --> 01:51:09,619
He's mortal.

1000
01:51:44,904 --> 01:51:46,155
"Death...

1001
01:51:46,906 --> 01:51:48,866
"...is only the beginning."

1002
01:52:18,521 --> 01:52:19,689
Time to go.

1003
01:52:30,408 --> 01:52:32,202
You've lost the book!

1004
01:52:32,452 --> 01:52:34,579
-l can't believe--
-Come on!

1005
01:53:03,358 --> 01:53:05,652
-Couldn't we just--
-No, Jonathan!

1006
01:53:12,575 --> 01:53:13,910
O'Connell!

1007
01:53:18,205 --> 01:53:20,330
-Wait!
-Come on, give me your hand.

1008
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:26,590
Good-bye, Beni.

1009
01:54:04,625 --> 01:54:05,835
Go away.

1010
01:55:27,335 --> 01:55:29,130
Thank you very much.

1011
01:55:29,835 --> 01:55:33,385
You've earned the respect and gratitude
of me and my people.

1012
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:36,555
lt was nothing.

1013
01:55:36,635 --> 01:55:38,970
May Allah smile upon you always.

1014
01:55:40,975 --> 01:55:42,600
And...yourself.

1015
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:50,440
Yes, anytime.

1016
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:52,735
Stay out of trouble.

1017
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:55,695
He's just leaving us here.

1018
01:56:00,285 --> 01:56:02,995
l guess we go home empty-handed again.

1019
01:56:04,495 --> 01:56:06,250
l wouldn't say that.

1020
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:10,085
Please!

1021
01:56:19,635 --> 01:56:23,100
How about you, darling?
Would you like a little kissy-wissy?
