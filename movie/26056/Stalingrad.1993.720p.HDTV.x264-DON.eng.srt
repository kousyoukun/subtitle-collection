1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,409
Late summer, 1942.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,975
World War II enters its 4th year.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,695
Hitler's armies occupy most of
Europe and part of North Africa.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,573
Russia faces its second large
offensive of the summer.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,977
Its goal: The Caspian Sea and the
oil fields of the Caucus region.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,058
General Paulus' 6th Battalion moves
quickly towards the cities of the

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,219
Volga, where the bloodiest massacre
this century is about to take place:

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,853
Stalingrad.

9
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,577
Porto Corvo (Italy), August of 1942.

10
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,692
Hearts are trump.

11
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,051
Yes, Lieutenant.

12
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,252
Onward and upward.

13
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,496
It's warm. It tastes like piss.

14
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,331
- You'll roast in the sun.
- Butter for the fish...

15
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,731
- That's enough, Lupo.
- Have a seat.

16
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,214
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

17
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,331
No, you need spades, not hearts.
Play a spade.

18
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,578
Onward and upward, Rollo.

19
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,772
Can I dry you off?

20
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,130
- This one's mine.
- No, no.
- Why not?

21
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,976
- Who won?
- I did.

22
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,250
Fritz, when are you going to throw out
that camel piss?

23
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,499
It was a going-away present.
For ten marks I can get you one.

24
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,494
For ten marks I'd buy a whole damn
palm tree and plant it on your head.

25
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,453
Whatever, you always get the best
cards... And I'm horny as hell.

26
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,850
I told you to leave him
at the hospital, but no...

27
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,172
Oh, God, sometimes I think...

28
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,737
the Tommies smashed your head
instead of his.

29
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,658
It's his last day.

30
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,570
- Let him play.
- His old lady's in for a surprise.

31
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,536
Lupo!

32
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,731
The doctor told him not to drink.

33
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,738
- He's gonna have a headache anyway.
- Good Italian wine.

34
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,168
What time is it?

35
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,892
Around 1:00. We can still find a whore,
right Lieutenant?

36
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,660
Look at all those women.

37
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,459
- And that present for your wife?
- That'll just take a second.

38
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,375
Battle formation. Hey, comrades,
help me with the Lieutenant.

39
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,378
Another formation.
What a drag.

40
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,291
Careful! That's my bottle.

41
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,578
Careful.

42
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,448
I can't see anything.

43
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,209
What kind of fucking watch
did you sell me?

44
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,458
Waterproof to 30 meters...

45
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,491
You still gotta wind it, stupid

46
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,811
We'll take him like this.
Grab the chair.

47
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,533
We'll do it this way.

48
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,419
What about my jacket?

49
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,491
Come on, guys. Move it.

50
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,976
- My jacket.
- Where's Rollo's jacket?

51
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,209
Careful!

52
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,935
Men:

53
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,775
The Fuhrer commends you...

54
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,256
for your fighting
in the African Campaign.

55
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,535
Pushing the English back to the Nile
wouldn't have been possible without

56
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,415
your valiant efforts. Foremost
in bravery were the Storm Troopers.

57
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,939
You were chosen

58
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,779
because you are the best.
Never forget that.

59
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,335
New missions now await you.

60
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,529
But first,

61
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,096
you will form the core of a new,
elite fighting company.

62
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,495
But before you leave,
let me present you,

63
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,256
in the name of the Fuhrer,
with a medal for your important role..

64
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,612
in the heavy and glorious combat
at El Alamein

65
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,974
Men, this is the new
Platoon Commander

66
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,252
for Second Company's 1st Platoon.

67
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,454
Lieutenant Von Witzland.
step forward.

68
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,979
Those to be decorated...

69
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,330
step forward!

70
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,414
Battalion, attention!

71
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:43,111
Right!

72
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,218
Lieutenant von Witzland,
decorate your men!

73
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,052
Why were you late, Corporal?

74
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,100
Hospital visit.
Your predecessor, sir.

75
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,173
Heros aren't late, Corporal.

76
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,054
Remember that in the future.

77
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,296
Sergeant,

78
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,777
do you intend to accept the Fuhrer's
award... with your collar open?

79
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,770
- Yes, sir.
- The award is revoked.

80
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,056
Battalion, at ease!

81
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,495
Dismissed!

82
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,695
Storm troopers, be ready
to move out in a half hour.

83
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,854
Battalion dismissed!

84
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,858
Don't leave me, men,
don't leave me!

85
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,654
Take me with you!

86
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,978
Let's go. Move along.

87
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,138
Viola!

88
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,652
Good bye, my love.

89
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,651
What's up, Fritz?
You in love?

90
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,579
When's the wedding?

91
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,089
Dearest Clara,
Russia.

92
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,096
Two thousand kilometers
separate us.

93
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,537
The vastness of the distance
is overwhelming.

94
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,254
I probably won't hear from you
again for quite some time.

95
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,090
You should still write...

96
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,849
although it will take a long time
for your letters to arrive.

97
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,459
Will it be hard for you?

98
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,940
I know if you had your choice,
I'd be sitting...

99
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,899
on a leather chair
in your father's office...

100
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,330
instead of on a bunk
in a freight car.

101
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,415
Please forgive me,
and try to understand my happiness.

102
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,454
The uncertainty of the last
few months has vanished.

103
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,290
All of a sudden,
my life has meaning, a goal.

104
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,489
Before, everything
seemed unimportant...

105
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,695
but as I get closer to
the front, my melancholy lifts.

106
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,939
All the feelings
I felt unworthy of...

107
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,659
especially my feelings for you,
burn bright again.

108
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,652
You should see me,

109
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,730
sitting surrounded by
these stalwart men of ours.

110
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,211
My men.

111
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,012
I love them, because I know
that only through hard work...

112
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,256
will I earn their respect.

113
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,417
If you were here beside me,
you'd probably faint from the smell.

114
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,537
Can't you count?
You gave him the ten.

115
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,533
Cut him a break.

116
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,772
Lupo was delirious,
and he played better than you.

117
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,695
Everybody screws up at first.
Don't worry.

118
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,579
He just can't deal with
my brilliant strategy, right Rollo?

119
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,851
Hey, those are mine!

120
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,738
Not anymore they're not.

121
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,688
Where's this crate headed,
anyway?

122
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,176
How about Stalingrad, gentlemen?

123
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,411
Time to teach lvan a lesson.

124
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,895
We'll take that city in three days. Cheers!

125
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,970
Do you always look that stupid?

126
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,650
If I didn't know better... I'd swear we passed
this same spot ten hours ago

127
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,617
Russia's big, all right.

128
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,454
After the war, everybody
will get what he wants

129
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,494
I've already ordered 200 acres
and 10 women.

130
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,816
Here?

131
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,416
- Not if you paid me.
- Then stay in your lousy little town.

132
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,856
Look!

133
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,016
They're already working for us.

134
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,409
Let's go, men!

135
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,889
Dig faster!

136
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,216
- How do you say "faster"?
- "Davai".

137
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,293
"Davai" and "Ruki vyerkh"
is all you gotta know.

138
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,575
Adolf will build us a freeway

139
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,539
All the way to Kirkov,
or whatever you call it.

140
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,528
This big country is just aching
for someone with a fleet of trucks.

141
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,208
That's enough, Rieser.

142
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,095
I find it touching that our Lieutenant...
is keeping us company.

143
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,090
Permission to ask a question, sir?

144
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,056
Go ahead.

145
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,291
Is this your first time
to the front?

146
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,497
- Everybody starts somewhere, right?
- Should be fun.

147
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,614
Make a bet with you, sir.

148
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,892
I come out alive and you don't.

149
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,129
And.. what's the stakes?

150
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,134
From you...
two cases of water.

151
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,895
Accepted.

152
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,699
And how's he supposed to pay
if he's dead?

153
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,775
This is pretty.

154
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,455
And we're not even
in Stalingrad yet

155
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,895
You want me to carry you,
Russian pig?

156
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,215
Move it!

157
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,859
Get up, you Russian asshole.
Go, go, go!

158
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,856
What are you waiting for?

159
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,848
Stop it! Leave him alone.
Give him a chance to get up.

160
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,975
Captain,

161
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,174
I must protest strongly
to the behaviour of your men.

162
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,572
You want to protest?

163
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,251
Fine. Go tell the Fuhrer.

164
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,217
Lieutenant! Over here!

165
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,050
Lieutenant von Witzland.

166
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,050
Storm Troopers Battalion 336,
2nd Company, 1st Platoon.

167
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,488
Welcome to Stalingrad.

168
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,098
All the specialists
are finally here.

169
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,179
Let me introduce Sergeant Pfluger.
Battalion 179.

170
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,415
He just returned from Voronezh.

171
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,455
I'm pleased you made it on time,
Lieutenant.

172
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,689
Now let's teach lvan
how to swim in the Volga.

173
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,853
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks! Captain...

174
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,894
I'd like to report an incident which
occurred on the loading platform.

175
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,173
I've already heard. It seems
you're very fond of the Russians.

176
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,779
Forget it.

177
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,178
See that the men are issued ammo
and grenades as soon as possible.

178
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,848
Then officers' briefing.
Dismissed.

179
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,608
Your uncle, Colonel Von Witzland,
is a good friend of mine.

180
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,291
He asked me to look out for you.

181
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,296
"God is with us".

182
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,529
It's engraved on every

183
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,298
German soldier's belt buckle.

184
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,616
No shit. I hadn't noticed.

185
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,296
There is no holier work...

186
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,859
than defending
Western Christian values...

187
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,698
against Eastern Bolshevism.

188
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,739
And that's what sets you apart
from the Bolsheviks...

189
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,738
who have no time for God.

190
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,536
You are never alone,

191
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,571
even when deep in enemy territory.

192
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,293
Muller, go!

193
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,179
Yes, sir.

194
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,215
They're crazy.
They're killing their own men.

195
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,694
Damned artillery.

196
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,656
Get down!

197
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,053
He's crazy.

198
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,255
Quiet, boys. Follow my lead.

199
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,453
Men, our objective is
that factory... at any cost.

200
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,778
We'll start with that
machine gun nest on the right.

201
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,978
Whenever the artillery hits,
the Russians hide.

202
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,378
- Can you see anything, sir?
- It looks suspicious.

203
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,934
Here, Captain.

204
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,579
We're at Frieda 20.
Cease fire.

205
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,338
I repeat, hold your fire.

206
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,137
Where are the five assault cannons?

207
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,650
We can't see anything,
as usual.

208
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,330
As ordered, Major

209
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,854
All clear to the second point.

210
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,617
Fire only on my command
and maintain silence.

211
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,970
Understood?

212
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,100
Let's go, men. Follow me!

213
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,356
Shit!

214
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,913
You klutz, Feldmann.

215
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,229
It's not my fault, Emigholz.

216
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,032
Now lvan knows where we are.

217
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,150
I'm sorry.

218
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,354
Shit!

219
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,314
Erwin!

220
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,630
It's no use, boys. He's gone.

221
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,868
Take cover!

222
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,676
He said, they're better than ours.

223
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,319
They don't get jammed.

224
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,595
Cheer up!

225
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,559
Kill yourself some Russians with it.

226
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,852
Smoke them out.

227
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,134
Take cover!

228
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,175
Hit the foxholes!

229
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,052
Watch the gas tanks!

230
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,412
Keep moving, men.

231
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,814
We're getting closer.

232
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,014
Go, guys! Forward!

233
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,937
What's wrong?
You stuck? Move!

234
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,177
That way! Move it!

235
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,971
I can't! I can't go!

236
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,452
Get out of the hole!

237
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,010
Pull yourself together, you fool!

238
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,774
Leave him.
Get his tags and let's go.

239
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,689
If you don't come, I'm leaving.
I can't help you anymore.

240
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,890
Go ahead and die, then.
It's your fault.

241
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,417
Keep moving. Come on!

242
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,853
I told you so, idiot.

243
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,255
Follow me!

244
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,090
We can't make it, Captain

245
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:04,590
It's impossible

246
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,733
Nothing's impossible, Lieutenant.

247
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,173
Find a smoke grenade.

248
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,458
Smoke grenades!

249
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,931
We got to take out that cannon.

250
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,173
Fritz, smoke grenade!

251
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,518
He's right, sir.
We can't make it..

252
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,559
Feldmann, now you can make up for your mistake.

253
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,589
You want your wife to be proud
of you when you return, don't you?

254
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,795
Let me go, Captain.

255
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,195
No, I'll go.
I won't let you down, Captain.

256
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,549
I know, son.

257
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,193
We'll cover you.

258
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,396
Go!

259
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:27,728
Or else we'd never make it.

260
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,869
Feldmann owed us.

261
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,750
Let's go, men!

262
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,234
Now we'll show them.

263
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,319
Pfluger, take the left.
Witzland, take the right.

264
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,454
We must take this factory

265
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,954
Forward, men! Follow me!

266
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,519
Cover us.
Shoot anything that moves.

267
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,199
Let's go, Fritz.

268
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,915
Dieter.

269
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,594
I shot him.

270
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,110
Shoot me already! Shoot me!

271
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,913
Hands up! Faster! Davai!

272
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,475
- Ruki vyerkh! Now!
- Davai! Davai!

273
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,832
I shot my friend!

274
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,109
I killed him!

275
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,355
I shot him!

276
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,270
- I don't deserve to live!
- So what! Now just shut up!

277
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,515
Don't worry..

278
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,914
I did the same once.

279
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,952
It's normal in close combat.

280
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,875
If he'd been Russian,
you'd be dead.

281
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,155
Mother, I'm sorry I left you alone.

282
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,549
Mother, stay with me.

283
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,318
What should I do...

284
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,192
so we can stay together?

285
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,549
Mother...

286
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,354
Wait.

287
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,152
Pfluger, come back!

288
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,634
Take cover!

289
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,478
Get a gas barrel!

290
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,235
Next target: Control room.
6:00 p.m. German time.

291
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,798
I need two volunteers.

292
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,558
- We'll go.
- Good.

293
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,359
Come on, push!

294
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,118
One, two, go!

295
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,670
We'll get the Iron Cross for this.

296
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,518
It'll look great
on our coffin, Rollo.

297
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,954
Take cover!

298
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,636
Shit. Mother'll die
if I get hurt.

299
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,314
Finally, my Iron Cross.

300
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,515
What are you waiting for?
You want to lose another 300 men?

301
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,519
Forward!

302
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,919
Cover the exits!

303
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,195
Stay where you are!

304
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,397
Don't move! Ruki vyerkh!

305
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,828
I shit myself.

306
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,790
I shit in my pants.

307
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,872
You're not the only one.

308
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,838
<i>Radio: I wanted to reach not just
the Volga, but a certain..</i>

309
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,439

310

<i>a certain city.</i>

00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,998
<i>By coincidence this city
bears the name of Stalin himself,</i>

I marched there.</i>

313
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,551
<i>It wasn't the name, but the fact
that it's a very important point.</i>

<i>"Why don't you fight faster?"
I don't want a second Verdun.</i>

325
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,039
<i>I'd rather fight with very small
combat patrols.</i>

326
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,037
<i>Time doesn't matter.</i>

327
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,631
<i>What matters is cutting off
the Volga.</i>

328
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,750
We have to keep an eye on Ivan.

329
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,475
"Small combat patrols".

330
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,956
- What did you say?
- Only 62 of us left.

331
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,359
And for your information,

332
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,237
we started with 400 men.

333
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,711
Why not tell everyone?
Boost morale.

334
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,434
At least we've got Ivan's stove.

335
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,112
Damn stuttering.
After every attack

336
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,754
Better to stutter

337
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,199
than to die..

338
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,196
Right.

339
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,035
Congratulations.
You're still alive.

340
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,228
Have a smoke.

341
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,114
- I don't drink my courage..
- Asshole.

342
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,119
What are you thinking about?

343
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,315
I'm not.

344
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,633
If you start thinking,
you go crazy.

345
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,069
So I don't.

346
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,599
Have a swig of this.

347
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,597
You've got a little switch
right here. Just turn it,

348
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,112
and you stop thinking.

349
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,668
I'm sorry.

350
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,630
Be glad you can still cry.

351
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,511
Go on, cry. It's good for you.

352
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,029
What's your name?

353
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,516
Muller.

354
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,958
We've got too many of those.
At least until the next attack.

355
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,548
You're a little go-getter, Muller.

356
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,394
GGM

357
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,639
You okay, GG?

358
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,950
What is it?

359
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,270
The Russians tried to get
a couple of their wounded, sir.

360
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,276
so I shot.

361
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,078
- They'd do the same to us.
- Quiet

362
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,193
Can anyone speak Russian?

363
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,995
Me, sir.

364
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,431
Call over and ask if they want
a short truce..

365
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,159
to get the wounded.

366
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,836
Excuse me sir, but that's forbidden.
The captain..

367
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,308
would never allow it.

368
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,836
Shut up, Muller.

369
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,396
you stupid ass, you idiot!

370
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,157
I was only telling you
our standard procedure.

371
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,833
Nobody in this city cares

372
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,189
about standard procedure.

373
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,350
Go ahead, Wölk.
That's an order.

374
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,454
Our Lieutenant asks

375
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,273
do you want to get the wounded?

376
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,399
(speaking russian)

377
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,799
We have to go first.

378
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,096
I'm not going out there.

379
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,230
Me neither.

380
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,351
- Emigholz.
- Yes, sir.

381
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,516
Pass it on: short cease-fire.

382
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,279
We'll need medics.

383
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,234
Bee one to beehive.
Cease fire. We need medics.

384
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,429
I'll go with you.

385
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,312
You'd better stay.

386
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,755
You're better off here.

387
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,632
You look like my son.

388
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,389
- How old's your son?
- Three.

389
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,279
Let me go.

390
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,195
It's me. Kolya.

391
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,792
I'll help you. Don't die.

392
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,575
Sons of bitches!

393
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,413
Cover them!

394
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,697
Aim for the windows!

395
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,337
God damn it!

396
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,132
Hand grenade!

397
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,819
- Shoot, Wölk!
- Move clear!

398
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,369
Don't shoot!
Hold your fire!

399
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,652
You'll get an Iron Cross
for that, sir.

400
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,213
Who opened fire?

401
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,578
Who opened fire?

402
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,896
Quiet, boy.

403
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,179
The Russians were going to attack.
When I saw them, I shot.

404
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,575
- You're full of shit!
- He's right, Lieutenant.

405
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,011
I should court-martial you.

406
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,175
Go ahead, sir.

407
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,531
I'll tell about illegal contact
with the enemy!

408
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,450
We don't need a court, sir.

409
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,849
Just give him to the Russians.

410
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,499
You'll get in the newspaper.

411
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,579
The obituary column.

412
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,416
Asshole.

413
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,013
Emigholz, you asshole!

414
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,778
Always sleeping.

415
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,533
My shaving kit.

416
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,097
Who's got my shaving kit?

417
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,058
You're still the prettiest.

418
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,659
You should model for the cover
of Today's Army

419
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,534
Grub's here!

420
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,418
False alarm.

421
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,973
They were shooting at the grub.

422
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,817
Mails! Great!
Let's have them.

423
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,899
What did they bring us?

424
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,579
Horseshit again.

425
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,850
Those guys are fucking insane.

426
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,689
They should eat this crap
themselves.

427
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,697
Quit complaining, Rollo.

428
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,139
Yeah, I know.

429
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,533
We're the beasts who invaded Russia.

430
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,211
Rollo, I got something for you.

431
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,689
No mail?

432
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,814
She wrote me again
that she's had a boy.

433
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,056
That was in her last letter.

434
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,451
But not a word about the cow
that's supposed to calve.

435
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,793
Oh, well. She's not the brightest...
She wasn't good in school either.

436
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,611
But the smallest.

437
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,812
- He married a dwarf.
- So what?

438
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,938
At least she loves me.

439
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,809
If only I knew that my cow was okay.

440
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,335
Listen up.

441
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,692
Someone's been stealing our eggs.

442
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,413
They should hang the bastard.

443
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,059
Look who's talking.

444
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,291
- You loot every Russian corpse.
- That's different.

445
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,092
We're at war.
They're not at war back home.

446
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,012
Here's a letter for you.

447
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,890
Asshole.

448
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,179
From your wife?

449
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,412
She's at home
guarding our furniture.

450
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,015
Schalke beat Hannover 3 to 1.

451
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,892
Alemania lost again.

452
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,098
That's in your letter?

453
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,892
After the war, I'm gonna
play for Werder Bremen..

454
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,058
I've already tried out.

455
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,732
Soccer's bullshit.

456
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,248
I have a rowboat.
A two-seater.

457
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,331
My old lady rows while I relax.

458
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,531
By evening, she's tired and quiet.

459
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,854
I have one too.

460
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,331
Hares or rabbits?

461
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,696
Big.

462
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,891
Your boots... nails bad.

463
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,930
Much cold...

464
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,370
Russian winter.

465
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,537
I can fix them.

466
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,290
Me cobbler.
Father cobbler.

467
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,019
Grandfather cobbler.

468
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,934
Quiet!
How do you say "quiet" in Russian?

469
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,415
Let them sing. It sounds nice.

470
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,534
Poppy bread.

471
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,409
Hey, Rollo.

472
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,852
Granddad sent me beeswax.
Cure for rheumatism.

473
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,813
Something happen at home?

474
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,048
Bomber attack?

475
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,339
You could say that.

476
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,095
While I'm risking my ass
for the fatherland,

477
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,417
she shacks up with a Frenchman.

478
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,528
A P.O.W.!

479
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,373
That's illegal.

480
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,368
Are you sure?

481
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,658
Maybe it's just a rumor.

482
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,410
She wrote me personally.

483
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,293
Wanted to tell me personally.

484
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,017
We beat the French in six weeks.

485
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,812
She's afraid, of course.

486
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,696
I'll make the Russians pay for this.

487
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,579
But he's French.

488
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,139
Who gives a fuck?

489
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,850
- What's up?
- Nothing. Drop it!

490
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,619
His wife's fucking around.
It's better nobody knows.

491
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,448
Kiss my ass!

492
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,899
You all hate me!

493
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,359
Especially you, Lieutenant!
You think I'm a country fool!.

494
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,659
Rohleder..

495
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,058
- Leave me alone.
- You're my best man

496
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,056
Without you, we'd be dead already.

497
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,613
You'd have won your bet.

498
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,251
- Rohleder! Reiser!
- Here..
- Here..

499
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,251
Lieutenant, follow us!

500
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,631
Wölk, Pflüger, cover the doors!

501
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,689
Damn it, Pflüger, cover the doors!

502
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,019
Russians everywhere.

503
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,312
We've got to go down there,
or they'll cut us off.

504
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,695
Reiser!

505
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,530
Here, sir.

506
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,738
There's no contact, sir.

507
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,216
Get your flamethrowers! Go!

508
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,218
Just us, sir?

509
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,490
Emigholz and I will follow.
Wölk!

510
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,811
Yes, sir.

511
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,659
Stay here. If we're not back
in two hours, break through.

512
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,532
- Time check?
- 7:00 a.m. German time.

513
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,259
Why me?
I'm the radio man.

514
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,933
Sir, let me go along.

515
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,530
- What the hell for?
- Let him come. He might bring us luck.

516
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,493
Fine.
Emigholz, the flamethrowers.

517
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,458
Hands up!
Get them up!

518
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,773
You're surrounded.
If I scream,

519
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,214
you're dead.

520
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,935
And so are you.

521
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,772
At least say it properly.

522
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,175
Is he dead?

523
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,214
He's dead, all right.
You're experts at killing.

524
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,014
Quiet, or I'll shoot you.

525
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,172
Shoot me and you'll die.
You'd never get out of here.

526
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,655
Come.

527
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,774
- That's the wrong way.
- Don't try...

528
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,658
How about a truce?

529
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,335
I help you find your people,
and you let me go.

530
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,019
Why should I trust you?

531
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,935
I could have killed you.

532
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:00,937
With this?

533
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,979
Yes, with that.

534
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:04,896
Wait!

535
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,453
What's in your other boot?

536
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,895
My spoon.

537
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,695
You want that too, Lieutenant?

538
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,298
How do you know German?

539
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,135
All right.
You have my word as an officer.

540
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,535
If you get me out of here,
I'll let you go.

541
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,615
You go first.

542
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,448
Of course.

543
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,051
Slowly.

544
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,214
- Are you all right?
- Shit, Reiser.

545
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,371
We've got to keep moving.

546
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,374
Thanks, Reiser. I won't forget it.

547
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,409
And Emigholz?

548
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,090
- Help me!
- There he is.

549
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,693
My leg!

550
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,812
Quiet! If he doesn't shut up,
I'll kill him myself.

551
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,098
Your leg's fine.

552
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,018
That's good, Muller.

553
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,572
Keep moving.
We have to get out of here.

554
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,371
Move, men! Keep going!

555
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,493
- Were Germans here?
- They went that way.

556
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,374
Be careful, girl.

557
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,339
Thanks, Uncle.

558
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,335
Medic!

559
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,498
What's going on?

560
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,252
Who's helping the wounded?

561
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,293
Who knows? The Russians
broke through somewhere.

562
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,570
The Romanians, I think.

563
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,451
- Get me out of here.
- Lie down.

564
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,174
- Hold still. I'll get a doctor.
- Where are my boots?.

565
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,377
- We need a doctor.
- I don't know...

566
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,609
I need a doctor.

567
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,450
Doctor!

568
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,377
- I'm not a doctor.
- Over here! Move!

569
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,779
Get to work!

570
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,255
Reiser, put the gun away!

571
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,889
And let him die?
Let them all die?

572
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,660
- Get to work.
- I'm not a doctor.

573
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,733
Not another word!
Everyone shut up!

574
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,095
Get to work!

575
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,259
Edgar, the doctor's here.

576
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,089
Help me.

577
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,813
Drop your weapon.

578
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:20,379
Captain, let me explain.

579
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,054
- Explain what?
- We just came from the front, sir.

580
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,256
- Shut up.
- We risked our life for our comrade.

581
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,049
Where are you, Schroeder?

582
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,739
Where's my bag and jacket?

583
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,015
I expect a report about
this unheard-of incident.

584
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,571
Right away, sir.

585
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,654
He's dead.

586
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,012
This can't be..

587
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,497
All for nothing.

588
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,693
You're all under arrest.

589
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:00,936
Take their weapons.

590
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,058
What happens to us now?

591
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,099
I didn't want this.

592
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,174
I request to speak
with the General Hentz.

593
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,290
You think you're special?

594
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,577
But it's your right, I suppose.

595
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,135
God damned Russian sympathizer.

596
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,853
Take them away.

597
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,413
To sum up the situation,
gentlemen...

598
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,492
we're in deep shit.

599
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:41,651
Day before yesterday, the Russians
broke through the north, near Kletskaya.

600
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,332
And now, they've broken through
in the south too.

601
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:53,415
They will try to close the circle around
Kalach.. sometime today.

602
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,296
If they succeed, we'll be
sitting ducks, gentlemen.

603
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,013
Keep smoking, Krüger.

604
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:04,657
Captain, You must help me. Some of
my men were arrested at the hospital.

605
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,655
One of the men was wounded.

606
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,970
Reiser lost control
and threatened a doctor.

607
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,216
Is this a proper report?

608
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,775
Captain, we were trapped.

609
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,972
The entire 6th Army is trapped!
Pull yourself together.

610
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,171
We're trying to decide the fate
of an army,

611
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,336
and you're whining about
a couple of men!

612
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,138
You can't do this, sir.

613
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,218
The men believed in you.
They fought for you.

614
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,974
Are we nothing more than a flag
on your God damned map?

615
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,613
Excuse me, General.

616
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:34,491
What's going on?

617
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,219
It's about the incident
at the hospital.

618
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,219
I'll have the Lieutenant
escorted out.

619
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,410
Some of my people used force
to get preferential treatment..

620
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,130
- for one of their soldiers.
- Isn't that the young Witzland?

621
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,652
Nasty business
you got yourself into.

622
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,235
Will we be court-martialed, sir?

623
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,370
This will not go unpunished.

624
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:13,090
December 1942. The 6th Army's
been surrounded 6 weeks.

625
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,693
You'll learn.

626
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,310
What's going on here? Why isn't..

627
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,430
the road open?

628
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,313
- Look at all those medals.
- You like them, Rollo?

629
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,199
Ask him if you can touch one.

630
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,718
Asshole.
It's your fault we're here.

631
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,994
- Break it up.
- Save your strength for the front.

632
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,997
We need every man we can get.

633
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,713
Everyone in the truck.

634
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,070
Move it!

635
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,110
You, too.

636
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,315
But I...

637
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,589
That's an order!

638
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,993
Since it's Christmas, I'm going..

639
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,517
to give every man some bread.

640
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,679
But only if you ask me
for it nicely.

641
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,269
Say "please"..

642
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,799
my former Lieutenant.

643
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:26,815
Please.

644
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,633
Merry Christmas.

645
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,554
Get out of the truck!
Out!

646
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,748
This is insane. They'll never
make it to the front.

647
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:14,831
Get out or I'll shoot.

648
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,157
Shoot me! I don't care!

649
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,478
- Leave him alone.
- Go to hell.

650
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,193
Ivan'll finish the job.

651
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,038
- What's this?
- Hermann...

652
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,516
What's are you doing?

653
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,233
This man was shirking his duty.

654
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,919
Get out of my sight!

655
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,751
Lieutenant, this is suicide.

656
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,832
- I refuse.
- Then go home.

657
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,914
Rollo, I can't take it anymore.

658
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,310
Quiet, men!

659
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,035
We've had it. No more!

660
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,395
Shoot us all!
I don't care anymore.

661
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,550
Quiet!

662
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,314
Listen up.

663
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,593
The Russians tried to drive us
out of Marinovka yesterday.

664
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,319
Knight's Cross.

665
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,671
Despite heavy losses,
we held our positions.

666
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,431
I'm sure the Russians
will try it again,

667
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,274
But without your help,
the line won't hold.

668
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,316
Why is this position important?

669
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,435
Marinovka is our best chance
to break through..

670
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,598
to General Hoth's Panzer division

671
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,598
which is just a few kilometers away.

672
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,791
And as you all know,

673
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,072
we must break out to survive.

674
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,914
I ask you:

675
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,158
Do you want to starve
without fighting...

676
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,558
to be responsible for the deaths
of 300,000 comrades?

677
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,517
Think it over, men.
Is it worth fighting for??

678
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,432
Some choice.

679
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,079
We're going to make it, Fritz.

680
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,594
As long as the Captain leads,
we'll fight.

681
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,598
But if you fall,
all bets are off.

682
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,954
Agreed.

683
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,073
Comrades, we're going to give these
prisoners.. a chance to redeem themselves.

684
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,038
You'll be honorably reinstated
after this battle. On my word..

685
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,829
Witzland, give me your word as
a German officer that you agree.

686
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,235
Yes sir, Captain.

687
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,595
All right.

688
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,033
Get ammunition

689
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,477
and form two squads.

690
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:32,032
Wölk, lead the first squad.
Müller, the second. Dismissed.

691
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,359
Otto, just a moment.

692
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,591
We don't stand a chance.

693
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,916
Why not surrender?

694
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,350
You know what would happen
if we did.

695
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,073
Do we deserve any better?

696
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,639
I'm not a Nazi, Otto.

697
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:09,749
No.

698
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,991
you're worse,
you lousy officers.

699
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,878
You went along...

700
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,389
even though you knew
who was in charge.

701
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,478
I told you what would happen..

702
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,516
If I live through this,

703
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,276
I'm gonna forgive the old lady.

704
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,997
I had them tell my wife
I was dead.

705
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,152
It's for the best, believe me.

706
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,110
But we'll make it home someday.

707
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,394
So what?

708
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,668
I'll tell you a Christmas story.

709
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,872
Exactly one year ago today
was the last time I was home.

710
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,073
Special Christmas leave

711
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,196
because I destroyed three tanks.

712
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,198
My wife and kids

713
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,716
met me at the station.

714
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,995
They were stranger to me
than any of you.

715
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,117
She tried to understand,
tried to be tender.

716
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,236
But the more she tried
to understand,

717
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,559
the more I hated her.

718
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,872
Finally I ran off

719
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,154
and got drunk.
There was nothing else to do.

720
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,948
My wife wasn't sorry
when I left the next day.

721
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,799
Just the children.

722
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,148
I got back just in time
for the new Russian offensive.

723
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,631
And I felt like I was home again.

724
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:44,578
The action's in here.
Don't bother the officers.

725
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,297
We grunts gotta stick together.

726
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,378
- I finished high school.
- You'd never know.

727
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,654
Tanks!

728
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,834
- Who's got the grenades?
- Rollo.

729
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,272
I look like my grandmother.

730
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,429
- Rollo, grenades.
- Have fun.

731
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,596
Fire!

732
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,039
Get your ass down!

733
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:24,797
Fire!

734
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,558
Where's our artillery?

735
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,074
You're the artillery.

736
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,192
Get out! Get out now!

737
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,038
- I want out! Let me go!
- Pull yourself together!

738
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,475
Get down!

739
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,149
Rohleder, get back!

740
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,275
Come on!

741
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,274
Shoot the big guy!

742
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,035
They fit.

743
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,739
God damnit.

744
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,897
I just got used to this arm.

745
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:19,098
You okay, Captain?

746
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:22,259
The Russians can only hit
my right side.

747
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,408
I was lucky.

748
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:30,008
It's my last...

749
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,372
but we'll share it, Lieutenant.

750
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,218
Thank you, Captain.

751
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,216
Back to camp, men.

752
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,577
Now we wait for Hoth's army.

753
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,534
We'll take the cannon with us

754
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,379
Where are the horses?

755
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,733
We're the horses.

756
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,818
Everybody out! Now!

757
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,211
Close the door, it's cold.

758
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,018
Leave's been cancelled.

759
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,458
We're staying here.

760
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:57,015
You're crazy!

761
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,898
Everyone out!

762
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,375
How often did the Russians
make you shit in your pants?

763
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,657
All right! I'm a coward.

764
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:07,859
I'm scared!
This whole thing makes me sick!

765
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:09,529
Where's my pay anyway?

766
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,859
I get 36 Marks a month, and
if I don't get it right now..

767
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,573
then I'm going home.

768
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,816
- On foot.
- Calm down, Fritz.

769
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,132
The Russian army must be held.

770
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,335
The fun's not over yet.

771
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,052
Come on! Faster!

772
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,697
Move it, you grunts!

773
01:28:40,100 --> 01:29:04,772
In the name of the Fuhrer.

774
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,811
Carry out the order as given.

775
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,974
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

776
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,534
We're not finished, Lieutenant.

777
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:38,131
Follow me with your men.

778
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,335
Gentlemen...

779
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:51,418
Keep moving! Over there!

780
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,870
Fritz, can they do this?

781
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:00,739
It's to remind us

782
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:02,771
which side we're on.

783
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:04,488
Listen up!

784
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,849
These civilians...

785
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,572
are guilty of sabotage.

786
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,014
They are to be...

787
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,050
executed..

788
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,729
Positions!

789
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,809
They started the killing
yesterday.

790
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,339
There's no sabotage.

791
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,693
They're just out of food.

792
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,619
I can't do this.

793
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,929
If you don't, GG,
you'll be up there next.

794
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:34,896
Nothing we can do.
At least their suffering's over.

795
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,975
I can't.

796
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,256
That boy there.
He worked for us.

797
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,495
And for lvan too.
Shut up.

798
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,930
What the hell's going on here?

799
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,895
We must hurry.
There are more of them.

800
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,172
Captain, you can't do this.
I can vouch for that boy.

801
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,813
You again?

802
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,375
Does the boy appeal to you??

803
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:12,619
Remind you of someone back home?

804
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:16,809
- Child-killer!
- Shut up, asshole.

805
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:18,774
You want to be arrested again?

806
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:23,578
Return to your post.

807
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:33,289
- You're an officer. Do something.
- I'll handle this.

808
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,410
Silence!

809
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,810
Step forward, Corporal.

810
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,738
I'll kill that bastard.

811
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:43,895
Let him go!

812
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:49,057
Let me take his place, sir.

813
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:58,291
Come to attention when I address you!

814
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:02,855
Are you refusing to carry out
a direct order?

815
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,577
Let the boy go, sir.

816
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,338
That's enough!

817
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,697
There's nothing to discuss.

818
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,728
If you miss,

819
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,175
you'll be up there next.

820
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,268
Get back in line,

821
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:35,614
Corporal.

822
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:46,215
Do you want to take command?

823
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:53,415
And you're from an officer's family.

824
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,129
Take aim!

825
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:28,016
Why doesn't he do something, Fritz?

826
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:29,911
We didn't kill the boy...

827
01:34:29,986 --> 01:34:31,978
so you could let us
die out here, Lieutenant.

828
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:38,151
If you were too afraid
to give the right order...

829
01:34:38,227 --> 01:34:40,161
then at least give it now.

830
01:34:49,229 --> 01:34:50,163
Let's get out of here.

831
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,894
We'll go to the airport.

832
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,714
Somehow I'll get on a plane,
even if I have to wound myself.

833
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,893
Calm down, Fritz.

834
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,317
I'm leaving. I mean it.

835
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,158
Do you know what you're saying?

836
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,838
That's desertion!

837
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,772
Talk to him, Lieutenant.

838
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,749
I no longer feel bound
by my oath.

839
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:32,071
After all that's happened...
I think you have a right to leave.

840
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:40,073
I'm not going to let you
get us in trouble again.

841
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,873
That's enough! Understand?

842
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,312
You're not being reasonable.

843
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,316
You're just scared, Rollo.

844
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,914
Kill me.

845
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,031
You're a sergeant.
It's your duty.

846
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:14,352
- Fritz.. stay here!
- I pity you, Rohleder.

847
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:16,593
Fight to the end.

848
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,349
You're already dead.

849
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,793
Who's coming with me?

850
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,588
Say hello to your son for me
when you get home.

851
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,813
What about you?

852
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,435
I know it's crazy,
but I can't go.

853
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,179
I really can't.

854
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,850
A year ago,

855
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:54,549
I would have been first...

856
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,395
But now...

857
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,750
I'll keep him company.

858
01:37:02,851 --> 01:37:03,809
Good luck.

859
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,710
I think you'll lose your bet
with the Lieutenant, Rollo

860
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,593
Shit. Where the hell are we?

861
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,354
No idea.

862
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,913
I'll ask for directions.

863
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,772
Where's Pitomnik?

864
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:51,772
(speaking russian)

865
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,508
Bread!

866
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,789
Bread!

867
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,358
Head west...

868
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,550
Through the big balka.

869
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,397
Airport at 5 kilometers.

870
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,235
Thank you.

871
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,510
Come on.

872
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,392
Fritz!

873
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,392
He has a wounded tag.

874
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,669
You can still read
the doctor's signature.

875
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,179
"Doctor Heider".

876
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,638
This is our pass.

877
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:58,110
It's a free pass home!

878
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,137
Everybody look for one of these..

879
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:04,469
And put on bandages.

880
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,874
We're wounded.

881
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,153
For you, Hans.

882
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:55,434
Quiet, man. You're not
the only one in pain..

883
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,711
Ah! Powder burns.

884
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,934
- Obviously a self-inflicted wound
- Close combat. In the trenches.

885
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:03,757
- Take this traitor away.
- No, Doctor, no!

886
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:09,796
I can't do this.. They'll catch us.
I'm going back.

887
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,439
It's too late for that now.

888
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:17,077
- Just don't screw up.
- You neither.

889
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:22,557
At least I'm not
the only storm trooper here.

890
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,318
They should take more of us out of here.

891
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,357
We're needed elsewhere.

892
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,350
I have witnesses, Doctor!

893
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,193
What's wrong, son? Fever?

894
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,789
I can't read the signature.
Who's your doctor?

895
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,272
Can't you speak?

896
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,789
Doctor Heider.

897
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,793
Excuse him, Doctor.
He's in shock. Tank battle.

898
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,276
- His best friend was blown apart.
- Here you go, son.

899
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,037
For the fever..
You'll be home soon.

900
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,629
Keep an eye on him.

901
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,553
Yes, sir, Doctor.

902
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,629
Move!

903
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,031
Where's the Lieutenant?

904
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,671
Hans, we're over here!

905
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,772
- Be reasonable.
- The plane has to unload.

906
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:05,068
Over here!

907
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,911
You pig! Let me through!

908
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,633
You filthy pig!

909
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:36,831
Here come our heroes. Assholes.

910
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,159
Hans, where are you?

911
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:20,159
GG, hold on to me.
You bastard. You dirty bastard.

912
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:47,557
You could have made it.

913
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:53,951
The last German plane left
Stalingrad on January 23rd, 1943.

914
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,955
Comrade!

915
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,955
Comrade!

916
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,795
Kill me!

917
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:28,795
Otto..

918
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,199
Welcome to our grave.

919
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,593
Careful! Not so hard.

920
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,036
Are you hurt?

921
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,632
You know how fragile he is.

922
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:40,476
It's only rash.

923
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,676
He's covered with boils.

924
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,752
The Captain, he got the worst.

925
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,232
No planes for you?

926
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,236
No.

927
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,951
Musky, you old muskrat.

928
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,590
guess who saved your life?

929
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,798
That'll piss him off.

930
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:33,679
Leave the Captain alone.

931
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:38,354
My foot.

932
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:41,593
My God damned foot.

933
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,030
I wouldn't do that.

934
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,356
I told you not to do that.

935
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,031
Great. Now puke on him too.

936
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,992
Give me a butt.
Give me a damn butt!

937
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,153
I just don't have any luck
with my right side.

938
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,398
It's nice we can spend a little time
dying together.

939
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,029
Play something for us.

940
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,833
Damn medals.

941
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,035
Stand up!

942
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:55,809
Stand up, men!

943
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,555
And come to attention.

944
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:11,958
I want a report... Lieutenant.

945
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,475
Where is your unit?

946
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:35,759
We're not in the middle of nowhere.

947
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:42,598
We shoot looters
in the German Army.

948
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,949
Or have you forgotten?

949
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,915
Stay where you are! Stop!

950
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,189
GG, GG...

951
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:12,399
GG, he can't do this.

952
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,479
You... you can't do this.

953
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,472
Don't die, GG.

954
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,192
We'll make it home, GG.

955
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,311
Lieutenant, arrest that man.

956
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:44,999
And get me out of here.

957
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:50,070
You want a report?
The Russian boy's name was Kolya.

958
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:53,959
And this boy's name was Müller.

959
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,279
Like a lot of others.

960
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,791
You can still make up for this!

961
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:29,428
You must be very hungry.

962
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:33,275
I have supplies.

963
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,674
In the white house,

964
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,469
By the theater.

965
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,479
We'll drive there.

966
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,955
Germans don't shoot Germans.

967
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:56,638
I'm an officer.

968
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,753
You can't leave me here!

969
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:37,253
I can't believe it.

970
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:40,053
Bastards.

971
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:05,410
Slow down, or you'll get cramps.

972
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,813
By rank. We'll go by rank.

973
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:36,610
You're first, Lieutenant.

974
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:44,449
So, GG. Some for you.

975
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:50,133
Dead Rollo...

976
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:51,975
cheers.

977
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:55,255
Dead Otto...

978
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,579
Dead Fritz...

979
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:02,771
to our grand offensive.

980
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:24,259
Three's the trick

981
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,576
Hearts are trump!

982
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:30,736
Hey, Fritz! Hearts are trump.

983
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:33,576
There's a little bit of blood
on the back

984
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:36,248
of the ten of spades,
just so you know.

985
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,494
Damn...

986
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,813
right side.

987
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:44,452
Three play cards...

988
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,772
while the other's getting laid.

989
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:56,617
I'm not pretty enough for you?

990
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:59,697
I want a woman once more
before I die.

991
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:03,576
- You're all that's left.
- You could do me one favor.

992
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:06,533
- Shoot me! But you're afraid!
- Stop it!

993
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:09,334
You've probably got
an innocent girl at home.

994
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:12,735
Do you love her? Yes? Oh, yes!

995
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:15,534
A German soldier's love...

996
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:18,537
increases with every step
between him and his woman.

997
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:22,576
But you'll never see her again.

998
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:27,812
You poor fool, you've probably
never even slept with her.

999
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:33,175
Maybe you should have a taste
of Slavic meat after all.

1000
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:34,690
There!

1001
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:38,217
As soft and white
as your virgin's!

1002
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:48,578
Fuck me and shoot me!

1003
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:57,778
Shoot yourself, if that's what
you want. I'm tired of killing.

1004
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:08,332
- Get out of here!
- No!

1005
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:15,852
You bastard!
You dirty bastard!

1006
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,858
I couldn't do it either.

1007
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:33,693
I'm the German's whore.
A collaborator.

1008
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:37,818
Nonsense.
They forced you.

1009
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:40,018
I should have killed myself.

1010
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:42,098
I thought that once, too.

1011
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:04,534
Quit slowing down the game.

1012
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:08,210
- Spades are trumps.
- There's some blood on the 10 of spades.

1013
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:12,937
You know us very well.

1014
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:17,014
I know you through and through.

1015
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:20,811
My mother was German.

1016
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:26,739
I used to love your language.

1017
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:33,530
I'll never forgive myself for that.

1018
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:36,211
I had the strangest dream.

1019
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:39,457
I had to piss, but I couldn't
because I was sleeping.

1020
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:40,695
Fucking dream.

1021
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:49,733
Better than pissing, eh Lieutenant?

1022
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:56,091
Have some real food.

1023
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:59,532
Then try again.

1024
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:05,290
I'll teach her to be nice to you.

1025
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:07,819
Don't touch her!

1026
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:11,009
I mean it! Nobody touch her.

1027
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:21,735
Everybody up!

1028
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:26,090
- Rohleder, come here.
- Yes, Captain.

1029
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:34,492
- Don't do it, Rollo.
- If he doesn't, I'll shoot you.

1030
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,090
Stay here.

1031
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,889
You wouldn't hurt
your Captain, would you?

1032
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:41,899
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

1033
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:44,974
I won't court-martial you.

1034
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:47,057
You were good soldiers

1035
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:49,734
until you chose survival
at any cost.

1036
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:51,815
Shut up.

1037
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:04,579
Don't move, Reiser.

1038
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:08,692
Do you think you'll be able

1039
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:10,333
to live with yourselves
as deserters?

1040
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:12,218
Shut your mouth.

1041
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:22,216
Don't kid yourself.
You should know better than anyone

1042
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:25,930
that you'll always be soldiers, no
matter what. The war is your home.

1043
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:27,209
You're already dead.

1044
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:32,490
For two years,
I've prayed to be killed.

1045
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:36,329
The flesh melts from my bones...

1046
02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:40,575
and seeps through the rocks.
But you know what?

1047
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:45,413
I put myself back together again,

1048
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:48,573
every night.

1049
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:52,292
And none of you can kill me.

1050
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:53,355
None.

1051
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:01,851
You used to be an officer!

1052
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:03,530
Quit laughing!

1053
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:08,338
Where's the front?

1054
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:11,330
I want a report.

1055
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:13,729
That's an order!

1056
02:06:17,740 --> 02:06:19,093
Heil Hitler.

1057
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,819
Let's get out of here!

1058
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:45,015
Wait, Captain.
I'll help you.

1059
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:48,295
Fresh air!

1060
02:06:59,860 --> 02:07:01,898
You're all crazy.

1061
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,989
A short rest, Captain..
Then we'll go.

1062
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:31,638
Don't fall asleep,
we're going soon.

1063
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:35,773
Where's the front?

1064
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:40,096
What's going on?

1065
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:43,815
General... Sergeant
Rohleder, Iron Cross.

1066
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,729
Give me your weapon.

1067
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:47,193
Come on, give it to me.

1068
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:51,074
I'm a deserter, sir.

1069
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,111
Don't talk nonsense, stand up!

1070
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,991
- Where's the front?
- Come with me.

1071
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:01,669
Gentlemen...

1072
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:07,631
The front. Where's the front?

1073
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,028
We'll go soon.

1074
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:29,598
Don't fall asleep.

1075
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,597
I'm not going to die.

1076
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:49,078
You know, Hans,
At home..

1077
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:52,236
when you die as a soldier...

1078
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:54,911
at least they're proud.

1079
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,238
That's something, isn't it?

1080
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:03,295
Siberia? Not me.

1081
02:09:03,897 --> 02:09:05,711
I'm cold enough.

1082
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,111
I'll get you out.

1083
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,779
I'm going with her.

1084
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,356
We won't even get 100 meters,

1085
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,398
But what's the difference?

1086
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:45,755
That way.

1087
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:50,833
Let's go. It's dark enough.
We made it.

1088
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:49,159
The best thing about the cold..

1089
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:52,312
is that you don't feel anything.

1090
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,316
Everything freezes.

1091
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,673
It's too cold to cry.

1092
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:14,871
Get out of here, Fritz.

1093
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:23,355
I mean it. Go!

1094
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:30,513
The best thing about the cold is..

1095
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:49,557
you don't have to worry
about sunburn.

1096
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:56,271
Ever been to the desert?

1097
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,638
You'd hate it.

1098
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:03,272
It's so hot.

1099
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,039
you're always sweating.

1100
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:09,632
You think you're melting,

1101
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:14,475
like butter.

1102
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:18,471
The desert is shit.

1103
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:22,952
Except for the stars...

1104
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:26,034
They're so close.

1105
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,794
You know?

1106
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:33,153
More than a million people died
in the battle of Stalingrad,

1107
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,715
in combat, or of starvation,
or froze to death.

1108
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:39,754
Russians, Romanians, Italians,
Hungarians, Germans.

1109
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:43,953
Of 260,000 German soldiers,
91,000 were taken prisoner.

1110
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:50,630
Only 6,000 returned
to their country years later.
