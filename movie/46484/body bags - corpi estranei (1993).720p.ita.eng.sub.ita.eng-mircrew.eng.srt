1
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,154
Ah, good evening.

2
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,117
I was just taking a little break.

3
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,032
It's been a busy night.

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,440
Lots of new arrivals.

5
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,000
I call them the arriving departed.

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,917
Ahh!
Well, back to work.

7
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,553
Eh, what the hell.
One more for the road.

8
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,519
Just a dash.
Adds a little spine.

9
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,599
Long life.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,114
Ohh, better!

11
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,589
Ahh, the doctor will see you now.

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,236
Hmm.

13
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,559
Uhh, ugly!

14
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,756
Man, are you ugly.

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,355
Well, we all know it isn't
what a person looks like.

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,351
It's what's inside that counts.

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,435
Mmm.

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,232
Ehh, death by natural causes.

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,796
Natural causes, natural causes.

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,796
More natural causes.
I hate natural causes!

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,952
Give me a big old stab wound
to poke around in, then I'm happy.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,634
Ahh, here we are.

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,074
Body bags.

24
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,720
See, if it's murder or suicide
or a nasty accident,

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,757
they put 'em in these bags.

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,400
This one was found
on a stretch of lonely highway,

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,677
miles from the nearest town
on a pitch-black night.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,397
<i>Also in the news, another gruesome
murder in Haddonfield today.</i>

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,915
<i>The body of a young woman
was discovered buried</i>

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,310
<i>in the bottom of a trash bin
behind a shopping mall.</i>

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,109
<i>Police Chief, Ardith Robinson
of the Haddonfield PD</i>

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
<i>gave a statement
to reporters this afternoon</i>

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,830
<i>after the discovery of"...</i>

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,994
<i>Police believe the woman to be</i>

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,436
<i>another victim of a serial killer
responsible for a series</i>

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,035
<i>of ritualized slayings
in the southland.</i>

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,952
<i>The body of the woman
was found by hikers--</i>

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,556
I'd be scared shitless working
all alone in a place like this.

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,597
Eh, I can take care of myself.

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,957
Besides, you're the one who has
to drive back to an empty apartment.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,156
- Ooooh.
- Thanks a lot.

42
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,231
You don't mind
picking me up in the morning?

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,958
<i>- What time?
- Seven.</i>

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,996
Ooh.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,117
This'll be the last time
I ask you for a ride, I promise.

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,316
They said my car will be
out of the shop by tomorrow.

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,437
I'll buy breakfast.

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,716
Deal.

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,234
See ya.

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,312
<i>Can I help ya?</i>

51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,959
I'm Anne.

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,075
Okay.

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,117
The new girl.

54
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,157
Oh, yeah, right,
come on in.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,349
- Hi.
- Hey.

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,317
- Sorry I'm late.
- No biggie.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,233
Oh, wow, this is almost identical
to the gas station I worked last month,

58
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,754
except that was a little bit smaller.

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,229
Well, why don't I give you
the, uh, the grand tour.

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,880
Uh, that's the cash register.

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,678
You just punch in the pump number
and amount, right?

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,194
Yeah, you got it.
That's the credit card machine.

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,236
No sweat.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,469
And listen, when you get
their, uh, signatures,

65
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,119
make sure you get the license
plate number, all right?

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,395
- Right.
- It's important.

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,960
Um, the TV gets
maybe three channels.

68
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,872
Actually, I'll probably just
do some studying.

69
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,520
Um, the cigarette prices
are posted outside.

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,670
- Saw it.
- Okay, good.

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,875
Is that the bathroom?

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,271
Well, actually, we, uh, prefer
to call that the employee's lounge.

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,759
Yeah, great.

74
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,672
Let's see-- oh, oh,
do I ring out the register

75
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,194
when the morning shift
comes in?

76
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,033
Nah, just, you know,
uh, he'll take care of that.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,635
Why don't you just collect
the cash and make change.

78
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,791
- Okay.
- Yep-- oh, you know what?

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,837
This door locks automatically
if you leave the booth.

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,160
- So, uh--
- Keys?

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,639
Right, keys, yeah, um--

82
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,109
God, I don't know
where the hell I left them.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,679
Yeah, here they are.

84
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,070
The round one,
um, that's for the booth

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,719
and the square one
works everything else, okay?

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,915
Got it.

87
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,150
- Public restrooms.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,154
Um... yeah, I guess
that's about it.

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,915
You know, I feel a little bit guilty.

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,752
Leaving you out here
all by yourself.

91
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,797
- Eh, I'll be okay.
- Did you hear the news tonight?

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,393
<i>- Yeah, it's horrible.
- Yeah.</i>

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,039
- Hmm.
- Hey, you know what?

94
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,997
If you got a problem,

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,550
why don't you,
um, just give me a call, okay?

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,710
<i>Hey, thank you.</i>

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,870
<i>- Sure, no problem.
- Will do.</i>

98
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,155
Okay.

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,799
Uh, that's it, then.

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,874
I'm outta here.
Have a good night.

101
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,792
- See ya later.
- You got it.

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,235
Pack of Coronados.

103
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,238
Two seventy-five.

104
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,795
Ls there anything else?

105
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,277
Uh, what you readin'?

106
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,794
It's for school.

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,314
A college girl, huh?

108
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,674
Yeah, well, I never got to go
to college myself, you know?

109
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,038
Yeah, I got some bourbon
out in the car.

110
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,396
Maybe I can get you
to come out of that booth.

111
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,632
Maybe I'll see ya around.

112
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,713
Okay.

113
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,039
Okay.

114
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,513
Hi, I need to fill her up.
Super unleaded.

115
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,157
- Number 12?
- Uh, yeah.

116
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,040
Haven't seen you
around here before.

117
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,033
It's my first night-- huh.

118
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,509
<i>Uh, signature
and license, please.</i>

119
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,839
Are you from Haddonfield?

120
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,114
Born and raised.

121
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,114
Thanks.

122
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,156
<i>What are you studying?</i>

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,319
Um, psychology.
Final exams next week.

124
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,959
<i>Gotta pull my average up.</i>

125
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,680
- You go to the university?
- Uh-huh.

126
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,512
Well, do you ever feel like,
uh, kicking back?

127
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,318
You know, just hanging out
someplace after class?

128
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,591
<i>- Sometimes.
- Well, you gotta try the Oak Lounge.</i>

129
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,717
<i>It's, uh, down Seventh Street
by the freeway.</i>

130
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,599
They got a really good band there
on weekends.

131
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,992
Hey, maybe if I run into you some time,
I'll play you a game of pool.

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,354
I'm no good at pool.

133
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,396
All the better.

134
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,955
Well, see ya.

135
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,356
Bye.

136
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,875
Ooh.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,675
Hey, you forgot your card!
Hey!

138
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,274
Shit.

139
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,632
Ooh!
Great.

140
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,195
<i>Hey.</i>

141
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,317
I need the key to the restroom.

142
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,637
I really have to go
to the restroom.

143
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,031
Oh, uh... the key's in the booth.

144
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,040
<i>I have to get the other set.</i>

145
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,758
Uh, I'll be right back.

146
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,600
Shit.

147
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,919
Ugh, thank God!

148
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,919
Great.

149
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,478
Oh, you pump,
I gotta go to the john.

150
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,675
I'm gonna take care of this.

151
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,559
Whoo-hoo, honey,
hiya, sweetheart!

152
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,314
Listen, give me,
uh, oh, $20.

153
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,152
Of that
superduper irregular

154
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,631
on, uh, pump number
niner there, okay?

155
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,356
You're a little glum tonight, hon,
what's wrong?

156
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,839
You oughtta be out partyin'.

157
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,752
<i>Pretty little thing
like you, huh?</i>

158
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,440
Say, uh, I need a key to get
in that little boy's room there?

159
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,874
Uh, you do.

160
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,394
Listen, could you do me a favor?

161
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,754
Sure, name it.

162
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,150
There's a man,
he's in the men's restroom.

163
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,390
- He's a little weird.
- Weirdo, huh?

164
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,153
Yeah, I don't know--
I was wondering,

165
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,753
could you take a look
and see what he's doing?

166
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,354
You got that.

167
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,633
Yoo-hoo!
There's nothing coming out.

168
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,110
What's the problem?

169
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,510
Oh, oh, there's nothing
coming out.

170
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,752
<i>- You have to lift the lever.
- Oh.</i>

171
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,195
No. The lever--
the lever on the pump.

172
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,193
Never mind, I'll do it.

173
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,199
<i>So sorry to bother you.</i>

174
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,317
I just usually go
to the full serve.

175
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,079
Oh.

176
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,720
Oh, thanks.

177
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,515
Guy is sleepin' in there.

178
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,113
He's all curled up
around the toilet.

179
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,919
I had to stand back
and aim over his head.

180
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,911
Shame on you.

181
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,196
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

182
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,999
I wouldn't worry about it, hon.

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,878
He's fast asleep.
The guy's a bum.

184
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,155
Let him sleep it off.

185
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,435
Did you get the restroom key?

186
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,397
Oh, I left it hangin'
in the door.

187
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,040
Come on, baby, let's go,
I'm cold.

188
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,872
See ya around, doll face.

189
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,633
Get in there, get in there,
arrrh!

190
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,274
God.

191
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,318
<i>Shit!</i>

192
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,029
I can do this.

193
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,471
Come on, come on...

194
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,235
Hi.

195
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,200
This is Bill.

196
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,316
I can't come
to the phone right now.

197
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,715
So, maybe you could
just leave a message.

198
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,280
See, I got a sore throat.

199
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,113
<i>Be better if you could
call back.</i>

200
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,716
If you wanna leave a message,
just wait for the beep.

201
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,995
<i>Beep.</i>

202
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,240
Come on, come on, come on.

203
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,714
Come on!

204
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,312
Answer the phone!

205
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,315
- 9-1-1--
- Oh, there's a man!

206
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,880
He's after me!
He's after me!

207
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,079
Bitch.

208
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,954
Oh!

209
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,674
Die, you son of a bitch!

210
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,474
Forgot my credit card.

211
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,675
Tell me, how long have you had
these feelings of hostility?

212
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,755
You can't say?

213
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,435
You know, you really shouldn't keep
your emotions all bottled up inside.

214
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,631
Eh, you're hopeless!

215
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,040
He should have had a lobotomy.

216
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,759
Let's go see what other fun things
we can find to do.

217
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,276
Cirrhosis of the liver.

218
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,634
Brain tumor.

219
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,634
Severe head cold?

220
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,030
Let's check the drawers.

221
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,635
I call these
my necrophile cabinets.

222
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,317
Seems to be stuck.

223
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,399
Obviously,
these drawers were built

224
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,313
before breast implants
became so popular.

225
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,754
These oughtta be recycled.

226
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,994
That's odd.

227
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,635
Ooh.

228
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,154
Marital spat?

229
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,200
Kiss and make up.

230
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,278
Ahh.

231
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,554
Believe it or not,
this was a human body.

232
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,031
Poor guy fell off a high-rise
onto the top of a car,

233
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,838
which swerved in front
of a train

234
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,753
and was dragged 900 yards
under the engine.

235
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,150
Fascinating what can happen
to the human body

236
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,674
under the right circumstances.

237
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,749
<i>Tonight will be mostly clear</i>

238
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,832
<i>but some low clouds late tonight
through midmorning tomorrow.</i>

239
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,150
<i>Light winds,
lows in the upper 50s.</i>

240
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,595
<i>High tomorrow
in the mid 70s.</i>

241
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,114
<i>And now this--</i>

242
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,476
<i>At the Roswell Hair Growth
Laboratories,</i>

243
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,359
<i>we have perfected
a simple surgical procedure</i>

244
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,559
<i>to restore full hair growth
virtually overnight.</i>

245
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,280
<i>After my Roswell Hair
growth treatment,</i>

246
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,113
<i>I bought the company.</i>

247
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,833
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

248
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,275
What's wrong?

249
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,230
Nothing.

250
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,475
Come on in.

251
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,390
More wine?

252
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,118
Mm, I'd love some.

253
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,198
- Richard?
- Hm?

254
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,190
What did you do to your hair?

255
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,110
Nothing.

256
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,155
Well, I mean,
I combed it a different way.

257
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,880
Sweetheart, are you worried
about your hair thinning?

258
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,270
No, of course not.

259
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,239
I think you look
very distinguished.

260
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,799
You're very handsome.

261
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,189
You don't like it, do you?

262
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,191
I like you.

263
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,400
<i>Eat.</i>

264
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,514
This veal is delicious, you know.

265
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,159
So, you think I'm going bald?

266
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,753
No, I don't.

267
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,993
What's the big deal,
if you are anyway?

268
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,753
Oh, so, now I am going bald?

269
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,990
It really doesn't matter to me.

270
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,435
Are you telling me
that you don't like hair?

271
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,158
Of course, I like hair.

272
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,753
Then how can you stand
looking at me?

273
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,274
I mean, look at this.

274
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,600
Look at that, huh?

275
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,275
Richard,
you're behaving like a baby.

276
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,431
Well, why not?
I got hair like a baby.

277
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,159
Why don't you let me make
an appointment

278
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,833
for you with my hairdresser?

279
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,036
Dennis'll give your hair
a nice shape.

280
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,758
I don't need shape.

281
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,877
I need quantity.
I need volume.

282
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,359
I need more hair.

283
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,794
Now, what about this?

284
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,118
- Huh?
- Forget it!

285
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,998
- No way, no way!
- Wait, wait, wait, hey, hey!

286
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,117
Come on,
just give it a chance.

287
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,395
Take a look at it!

288
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,950
- You mean--
- That looks ridiculous.

289
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,316
- It won't fool anybody.
- Would you be careful with that?

290
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,876
Oh, for God's sake, Richard.

291
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,710
Okay.

292
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,034
- Well, you see,
- Yeah.

293
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,554
I don't think you'd ever know
it was a hairpiece.

294
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,679
If you just take a little-- no.

295
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,158
- No-oh-oh.
- What about there?

296
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,958
- No?
- Wouldn't do it there.

297
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,439
- Hey!
- God, no.

298
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,510
Hey, wait a minute.

299
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,715
- It's gotta go.
- What are you--

300
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,154
Come on, man, I need that,
I need that back.

301
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,436
Richard, you're in denial.

302
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,638
It makes you look like
the world's biggest jerk off.

303
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,279
It makes me look like
I've got more hair.

304
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,350
Sit down, Rich--

305
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,834
I need that back.

306
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,035
Fine.

307
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,236
Let me just tell you
how things are, okay, Richard?

308
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,231
You're headin' for egg city.

309
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,597
Located in the chrome dome county
in the state of the cue ball.

310
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,795
Do you understand what
I'm talking about?

311
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,590
In a year, your head will look
like a Christmas tree lot in January.

312
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,435
I understand that.
That's why I need your help.

313
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,113
Have you got some kind
of a thickening agent?

314
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,760
Something I can put in there
and give me a little bit more,

315
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,672
you know, volume, huh?

316
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,592
I can help you, Richard.

317
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,954
How?

318
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,599
Only if you let me.

319
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,875
- Of course.
- Okay.

320
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,916
Now, what I can do--

321
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,920
I can cut your hair.

322
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,877
I can give it shape.

323
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,873
- I can give it style, Richard.
- Come on.

324
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,236
Now, I can empower you, Richard.

325
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,391
<i>- Give you back your manhood.
- I can't let you cut my hair.</i>

326
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,915
<i>- It's your birthright.
- What are you going to cut?</i>

327
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,755
Please, let me just
style it a little bit.

328
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,080
What I do is, see--

329
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,879
I start from--
We start from here.

330
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,280
No cutting, no cutting.

331
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,919
Fine, just styling.

332
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,030
<i>Just as plants
respond to soothing music,</i>

333
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,750
<i>your follicles will love
Harmonies for Hair.</i>

334
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,991
Grow, baby, grow.

335
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,350
Hi!

336
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,436
I really like your hair like that,
it looks nice.

337
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,510
How about a drink?

338
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,553
Did Dennis do that?

339
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,392
Do what?

340
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,471
Paint your head.

341
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,756
Who painted your head?

342
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,911
Doesn't work?

343
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,752
Dennis didn't do that, did he?

344
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,672
Tell me he didn't do that.

345
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,716
No, I did it.

346
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,115
You don't like it, do you?

347
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,111
<i>Poor baby.</i>

348
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,680
All this is really gettin'
to you, isn't it?

349
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,671
Oh, it's driving me crazy, Megan.

350
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,512
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

351
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,511
The only thing
I can think about is my hair.

352
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,920
I'm losing my hair.

353
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,399
Oh, darling.

354
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,273
It wouldn't be so--

355
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,714
What?

356
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,680
You-- you've got stuff
all over your face.

357
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,955
Oh!

358
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,150
Look at all this crap.

359
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,151
I disgust you, don't I?

360
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,675
What disgusts me, Richard,
is your inability

361
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,239
to accept yourself
as you are.

362
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,994
I just don't want
to be a bald guy.

363
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,639
You're not a bald guy.

364
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,519
You-- you're just--
you're just a thinning hair guy.

365
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,715
It means the same thing.

366
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,280
It doesn't mean
the same thing, okay?

367
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,316
What it--

368
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,234
I just can't deal with you
when you're like this, okay?

369
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,277
- Megan.
- Bye.

370
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,509
Megan.

371
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,559
Megan, please.

372
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,310
I think we need to spend some time
away from each other.

373
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,553
Oh, sure, just walk out
on the bald guy.

374
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,871
Do yourself a favor, Richard,
wash your head.

375
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,509
<i>Miracle Shine, the miracle shampoo.</i>

376
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,673
<i>Miracle Shine will add
new fullness of life to your hair.</i>

377
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,355
<i>That youthful luster is what
all other shampoo products</i>

378
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,512
<i>have claimed to achieve,
but never really delivered.</i>

379
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,309
<i>Miracle Shine, the miracle shampoo.
Add new--</i>

380

<i>With Colossal Grow

381

<i>Professional gardeners are buying

<i>The Roswell Hair Growth

<i>No painful and iffy transplants.</i>

385

<i>No silly toupees or weaves.</i>

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,035
<i>Just a full head

<i>Call now for an immediate

388

<i>Operators are standing by

389
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,312
<i>Remember, after my Roswell
hair growth procedure,</i>

390
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,038
<i>I bought the company.</i>

391
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,712
5-5-5-9-9-1-1.

392
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,629
Yes.

393
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,599
<i>Mr. Richard
Coberts is here for his appointment.</i>

394
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,114
Show him in, please.

395
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,198
- Nice to meet you, Richard.
- Doctor.

396
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,590
Mr. Coberts' before picture.

397
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,034
Have a seat, please.

398
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,110
I take it my nurses
fully explained our procedure.

399
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,716
Uh, yes, I saw your commercial
on television.

400
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,756
How does it work?

401
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,719
We revive dead hair follicles

402
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,519
by applying
a protein-based solution

403
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,797
to the hair roots
beneath the scalp.

404
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,393
What's in the protein solution?

405
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,959
That's patented.

406
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,634
I love it when he talks that way.

407
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,236
Don't you think he'll look just
too sexy with a full head of hair?

408
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,470
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

409
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,915
Richard might not be right
for our treatment.

410
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,471
Tell me, why do you want hair?

411
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,194
Uh, I think I'll feel better
about myself.

412
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,989
There are certain advantages
to being bald, Richard.

413
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,832
For instance,

414
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,515
Bald men are often considered to be
more trustworthy, less threatening.

415
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,798
<i>The primal power that a full head
of hair bestows on a man</i>

416
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,076
<i>brings a certain pressure
to perform.</i>

417
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,555
Some men realize that
they prefer to remain

418
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,836
out of the limelight.

419
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,357
Well, that may be so, Doctor,
but I want hair.

420
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,919
I want lots of hair.

421
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,594
You don't think
I'm up to it, do you?

422
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,592
- Are you?
- I think so.

423
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,591
I think so too.

424
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,830
<i>It'll change your life, Richard.</i>

425
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,069
I want it to change.

426
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,838
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

427
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,038
I love a positive man.

428
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,633
Very well.

429
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,196
Nurse, activate the compuscan.

430
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,080
I'll just insert your picture

431
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,470
into the graphic scanner.

432
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,194
And... voila.

433
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,433
Now, we, uh, have
quite a few hair personalities

434
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,352
for you to choose from,

435
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,193
uh, depending on which trait
you wish to emphasize.

436
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,473
This is your basic
conservative look.

437
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,597
We call it Traditional Republican.

438
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,716
- I don't know, eh...
- I agree.

439
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,313
No?

440
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,550
Well, uh, go a little bit more daring.

441
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,635
The Military Style, favored
by police, soldiers, athletes.

442
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,156
- I don't know, it's almost too, uh--
- Drab.

443
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,719
Exactly.

444
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,916
You see, I want something
that is very, um,

445
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,800
- exciting.
- Yes.

446
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,836
- Bold.
- Yes.

447
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,718
- Sexy.
- Yes, yes.

448
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,434
Let's try this.

449
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,438
We call this our Stallion Look.

450
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,633
Giddyup.

451
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,635
Yes, that's it, that's the one.

452
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,916
The Stallion Look it is.

453
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,991
Congratulations, Richard.

454
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,115
Uh, no surgery.

455
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,634
No, no, no,
heavens no, no.

456
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,358
We apply the solution here

457
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,478
then when you wake up
tomorrow morning in your own bed,

458
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,155
you take off the bandage
and you're a new man.

459
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,275
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
please let me have hair.

460
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,471
If I have hair,
I have everything.

461
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,474
I just want to love me again.

462
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,232
I don't love me
the way I am now.

463
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,271
I love me the way
I used to be.

464
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,192
The way I want to be.

465
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,477
Please, God,
just let me have--

466
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,472
Hair.

467
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,040
Oh, my... oh, my God.

468
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,240
I have-- I-- it's hair.

469
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,560
I have hair!

470
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,117
It worked.
Oh, God, look at tha--

471
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,471
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

472
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,437
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,114
It's the old me.

474
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,080
It's the new me.

475
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,435
It's the me
I've always wanted to be.

476
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,275
No, no, no.

477
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,715
I can't let you touch it.

478
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,474
If I let you touch it, I'll have to let
everybody else touch it.

479
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,394
Yes, yes, it is the source
of all my strength.

480
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,113
But it's not the only source.

481
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,997
See that my men are well fed.

482
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,038
And bring forth the women.

483
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,918
It's incredible!

484
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,515
Who is this Dr. Lock?

485
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,876
He advertises on TV.

486
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,031
Why doesn't everybody
go to him?

487
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,394
He's new.

488
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,630
It's amazing.

489
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,599
I can't believe
what it's done for you.

490
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,195
Ohh, mm-mm.

491
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,433
You even kiss better.

492
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,513
I know I said it didn't matter,

493
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,150
but you look so fantastic
with this new hair.

494
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,039
You're just so-- You're so--

495
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,591
You're so animal.

496
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,509
Tell me you love me, Richard.

497
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,999
Just me.

498
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,350
- Mm-mm.
- Morning, lover.

499
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,511
Morning.

500
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,160
Oh.

501
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,591
Oh.

502
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,557
Feel like I'm getting
a sore throat.

503
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,711
Maybe you overdid it
last night, huh?

504
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,871
Oh, I got this tickle
in my throat.

505
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,919
Well, I'd love to stay
and scratch it, but I gotta go.

506
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,120
See you later, sexy?

507
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,673
Take care of that sore throat,
you hear?

508
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,872
You gotta save all
your strength for me.

509
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,831
- I don't believe it.
- I don't either.

510
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,110
You know, this is--
it's amazing.

511
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,998
I know.

512
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,196
And it's not a weave.

513
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,520
No, no, it's all mine, baby.

514
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,434
Oh, man, it seems
so good and healthy.

515
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,636
You know what I mean?

516
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,711
Oh, man, all right, okay.

517
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,315
- Who is this Dr. Lock, huh?
- He's new.

518
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,713
- You look... great.
- I know.

519
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,473
You look great.

520
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,193
Now, I'm just going
to cut it a little bit, okay?

521
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,879
Just give it a little bit of shape.

522
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,155
You all right there, buddy?

523
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,196
Not too much, not too much.

524
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,760
No, no, no, just styled.
Just style.

525
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,595
Hello.

526
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,509
Lousy.

527
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,198
I don't know,
I just don't feel too good.

528
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,356
Huh?
Um, gettin' a haircut.

529
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,279
Yeah, well, after you left
this morning,

530
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,637
I discovered that my hair's grown
nearly six inches.

531
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,869
No, I'm not kidding.

532
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,394
I know, it's weird.

533
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,794
Listen, I'm glad you called.

534
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,998
Um, I'm gonna have
to cancel our date tonight.

535
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,912
I really think I'm coming down
with something.

536
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,672
No, I am not seeing
somebody else.

537
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,398
Come on, Megan,
what's the matter with you?

538
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,599
Okay.

539
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,079
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,594
That's all right.

541
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,796
Yep, thanks.

542
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,075
Bye-bye.

543
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,671
Ahh, ah.

544
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,555
Ahh, ahhh.

545
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,349
Oh, no, oh.

546
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,277
Hello.

547
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,112
Not so good.

548
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,520
What time is it?

549
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,232
What?

550
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,311
No, nobody else is here.

551
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,199
Why don't you believe me.
I told you I'm sick.

552
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,591
It's not an act.

553
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,553
What?

554
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,711
Oh, fine, suit yourself,
don't believe me then!

555
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,436
- Happy, darling?
- Yes, of course.

556
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,598
Ah, Richard, how are you?

557
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,795
Guess.

558
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,314
You look great.

559
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,471
Another successful operation.

560
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,120
What are you talking about?
Look what's happening to me.

561
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,271
I know, isn't it wonderful.

562
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,271
Let me show you something.

563
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,871
<i>You earthlings and your vanity.</i>

564
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,236
You're so predictably easy.

565
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,277
You know, at first,
it was difficult.

566
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,479
<i>When we arrived on this planet,
we were tiny, starving organisms.</i>

567
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,916
And then we discovered
that your brains

568
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,152
are the only food
on which we can thrive.

569
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,314
<i>The questions was one of access.</i>

570
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,230
We seem to have found
the answer.

571
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,351
In fact, we're particularly
enjoying your brain.

572
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,913
We like fat.

573
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,720
Nurse, transfer Richard
into implant containers.

574
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,438
Then call in the next patient.

575
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,189
Ooh.

576
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,634
It seems to me, maybe I'm going
a little thin on top myself.

577
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,915
Ooh!

578
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,389
I think we have time
for one more body.

579
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,357
Does anyone
have anything to share?

580
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,040
No volunteers?

581
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,716
What a bunch of stiffs!

582
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,553
I want you guys to think about this
while I go have a drink.

583
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,354
Ehh!

584
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,435
Ooh, I forgot about this.

585
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,834
This is weird.

586
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,632
This may make you
a little tense.

587
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,271
It made someone a little past tense.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

588
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,198
Here's looking at you, kid.

589
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,678
<i>Bice is hoping Matthews</i>

590
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,195
<i>can get something going here.</i>

591
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,395
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

592
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,840
<i>Good hit. Go.</i>

593
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,831
<i>Get over that fence.</i>

594
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,115
Yeah!

595
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,998
What's going on, Matthews?

596
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,515
All of a sudden you're knockin'
the hell outta that ball.

597
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,796
Yeah, I don't know,
I'm seein' it real good.

598
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,554
I don't want to make you nervous,
but the Giants got their eye on you.

599
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,233
Yeah, I heard that one before.

600
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,118
Hey, they could use
a good pinch hitter this year.

601
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,949
Still gonna talk to us peons
when you hit the majors?

602
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,030
Yeah, right.

603
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,872
I'm not about to start counting
my chickens.

604
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,394
I've been too close
too many times.

605
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,800
Somethin' always happens.

606
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,030
I got a feeling
this is your year.

607
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,509
Let's say we knock back
a few brews and celebrate.

608
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,752
I don't think so, bud. I got someone
prettier to celebrate with.

609
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,830
You better watch it.

610
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,116
It ain't natural to love
your wife so much.

611
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,753
Hello.

612
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,955
Hey, darlin'.

613
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,075
<i>How'd you do?</i>

614
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,754
Three for four and a homerun
to win it in the ninth.

615
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,400
Oh, that's great.

616
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,153
I've got some good news too.

617
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,675
<i>- What?
- Surprise.</i>

618
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,433
- Tell me.
- Unh-uh.

619
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,919
You gotta come home
to find out.

620
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,516
I'll be there in a flash.
Love ya.

621
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,352
I love you too.
Bye.

622
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,955
Jesus Christ!

623
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,835
Ah!

624
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,876
<i>Brent?</i>

625
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,234
You're gonna be okay.

626
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,715
Honey, Dr. Bregman is here

627
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,916
and he needs to talk to you.

628
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,479
Are you feeling up to it?

629
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,150
Good morning, Brent.

630
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,592
Now, let me guess, Doc.

631
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,237
Heh, I got a concussion and--

632
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,393
Yeah, your putting me
on the three-day disabled list.

633
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,234
Brent, I'm sorry to tell you this,

634
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,278
but it's much worse than that.

635
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,398
<i>I'm afraid you've lost
your right eye.</i>

636
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,470
But I'm a baseball player.

637
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,358
It's the eye I use...

638
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,397
to see the God damn ball.

639
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,993
Oh, Honey.

640
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,275
No!

641
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,750
<i>Dr. Watkins, Dr. Watkins.</i>

642
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,110
Brent.

643
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,599
This is Dr. Lang.

644
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,079
He'd like to speak with you.

645
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,630
What about?

646
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,637
I think maybe I can help you.

647
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,112
<i>I've spent the last ten years
of my life developing a method</i>

648
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,953
<i>to transplant an entire eye.</i>

649
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,395
<i>Now, it's never been done
or even tried.</i>

650
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,677
But I do think it could work.

651
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,833
Unfortunately, I'm pretty much alone
in that opinion.

652
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,070
Let's say I'm skeptical.

653
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,479
I could play again?

654
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,313
<i>Yeah, if it works.</i>

655
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,515
Well, what if it doesn't?

656
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,395
Well, if the eye dies,
we'll just have to remove it

657
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,437
and you and I are back
to square one.

658
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,560
When can we do it?

659
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,710
Well, I'd prefer
to do it right away.

660
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,077
I-- I just received
a healthy donor eye.

661
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,720
Oh, I-- I know that sounds
a bit gruesome.

662
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,236
But, uh, it's an excellent match
for your size.

663
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,840
It is a brown eye, but we can use
a contact lens to match your color.

664
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,835
Talk it over with your wife

665
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,433
and we'll chat tomorrow.

666
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,711
<i>The eye from a dead person?</i>

667
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,432
I guess it would have to be.

668
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,431
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

669
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,238
I know, it's weird, isn't it?

670
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,676
Oh boy, you think
about God's will.

671
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,956
- Is this God's will?
- Well, isn't it?

672
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,194
I don't know.

673
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:43,593
Well, he gave us the ability
to think and make discoveries.

674
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,638
You know what I mean.
You know, science and everything.

675
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,711
If it's for the good.

676
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,679
Well, what's not good about me
being able to have a career

677
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,195
and a family?

678
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,719
<i>- Darling?
- What?</i>

679
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,477
Nothing.

680
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,949
Brent, you're right.

681
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,555
<i>- Of course, we should try it.
- Sure.</i>

682
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,519
And if it doesn't work, babe,
it just-- it doesn't work.

683
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,360
<i>And Saul arose from the Earth.</i>

684
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,150
<i>And when his eyes were opened
he saw no man.</i>

685
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,072
<i>They brought him into Damascus</i>

686
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,278
<i>where there was a certain disciple
named Ananias.</i>

687
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,193
<i>And to him
said the Lord in a vision,</i>

688
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,672
<i>"Ananias, arise and inquire
in the house of Judas</i>

689
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,592
<i>for one cold soul."</i>

690
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,639
For I will show him
how many things he must suffer

691
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,870
for my name's sake.

692
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,954
And Ananias went his way
and entered into the house.

693
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,600
And laying his hands
on him said,

694
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,559
"Brother Saul,
the Lord Jesus,

695
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,870
who appeared to you
on the road as you came,

696
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,113
<i>has sent me
that you may receive your sight</i>

697
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,158
<i>and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</i>

698
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,553
<i>Immediately, there fell from his eyes
something like scales.</i>

699
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,359
<i>And he received his sight
at once.</i>

700
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:08,035
<i>And he arose and was baptized.</i>

701
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,389
<i>Mrs. Matthews?</i>

702
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,234
Mrs. Matthews?

703
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,236
Yes.

704
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,233
The operation
went smooth as silk.

705
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,756
<i>Brent's in recovery
and should awaken at any moment.</i>

706
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,234
I'm putting a patch
over the left eye.

707
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,159
Now, are we ready?

708
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,913
Ready.

709
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,436
Well, if everything
works out all right,

710
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,275
your vision should only be blurry
for a few days.

711
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,557
All right, now.

712
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,994
Here we go.

713
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,549
I like your hair
tied back that way.

714
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,960
Congratulations.

715
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,073
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

716
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,720
<i>Strike one,
slider down and inside.</i>

717
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,600
Hi, I made them let me off work
an hour early.

718
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,071
What's wrong, sweetie,
another headache?

719
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,309
Yeah.

720
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,470
The doctor said the headaches
will go away soon.

721
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,030
And tomorrow you get your blue lens
and it's home sweet home.

722
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,319
You don't have to turn it off.

723
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,516
Yeah, it's just--
I can't watch it.

724
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,999
It should be me up there.

725
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,560
It will be, baby, it will be.

726
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,469
What is it?

727
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,674
Uh, nothin'.

728
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,234
Everything's gonna be okay.
I promise.

729
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,912
The headaches should diminish
little by little.

730
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:49,075
Now, it's important that you do
the eye exercises I gave you.

731
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,040
Now, let's, uh-- let's try this
to see how this lens fits.

732
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,275
- Honey, it looks great.
- Yeah?

733
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,634
Yeah.

734
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,518
Well, Brent, I'm gonna send
you home tomorrow.

735
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,591
Now, remember--

736
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,830
<i>It's going to take
at least six weeks</i>

737
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,991
<i>for this surgery
to heal completely.</i>

738
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,310
Ls there anything
he shouldn't do?

739
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,357
Oh, light exercise, fine.

740
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,680
But nothing strenuous.

741
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,433
And I want to see you
in a few days, okay?

742
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,840
Thanks, Doc.

743
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,676
Oh, man.

744
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,990
It's great to be home.

745
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,072
Since you're in such a good mood,
I think we should celebrate.

746
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,559
- Yeah.
- I'll give you my surprise, hm?

747
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,960
Surprise?

748
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,430
<i>- What are you up to?
- You'll see.</i>

749
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,358
- Ready?
- I guess.

750
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,669
<i>♪ Ta-da. ♪</i>

751
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,200
Oh.

752
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,120
What's this?

753
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,589
It's a present, dummy.

754
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,750
For me?

755
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,314
To Dad from Mom.

756
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,718
You're gonna have a baby?

757
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,359
We're gonna have a baby.

758
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,840
Aren't you happy?

759
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,472
Oh, yeah.

760
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,994
You don't look very happy.

761
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,750
I am.

762
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,639
I am.
Darlin', I think it's fantastic.

763
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,838
<i>Brent, you're worried
about the future, aren't you?</i>

764
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,154
I don't know.

765
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,600
Maybe a little.

766
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,592
You know, whatever happens,
it'll be okay.

767
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,749
Sure.

768
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,280
Aren't you gonna open it?

769
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,678
What am I doin'?

770
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,996
Okay, let's see.

771
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,919
A crib?

772
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,718
I thought this was
a present for me.

773
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,871
It is.
You get to put it together.

774
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,157
I get it, I get it.

775
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,550
- Did you put your drops in?
- Yeah.

776
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,880
Is the blur almost gone?

777
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,633
Oh, it's pretty clear.

778
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,869
Does your head still hurt?

779
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,639
Oh, it's just once in a while.

780
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,872
I suppose I'm gonna have
to get used to this new part of you.

781
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:04,160
Hey, I'm not the only one
with new parts around here.

782
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,993
Ain't it somethin'?
Five weeks old.

783
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,791
Just think, eight months
from now it'll be opening day.

784
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,196
Wouldn't it be great.

785
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,795
I'd tear up the league
in Spring training.

786
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,314
The majors pick me up.

787
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,153
The baby's born on opening day
and I celebrate

788
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,392
by comin' off the bench in the ninth
and swattin' one over the fence.

789
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,720
Wouldn't that be great?

790
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,632
It'd be great.

791
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,033
You look so pretty.

792
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,711
Oh, are we not supposed
to have sex?

793
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,279
Oh, no, we can have sex.

794
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,636
I just think
we should wait a little.

795
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,916
Until you heal better.

796
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,435
The doctor didn't say
anything about that.

797
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,909
<i>Well, maybe tomorrow,
sweetie, okay?</i>

798
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,073
It's just-- I'm not feeling, well--
you know.

799
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,198
I love you, Brent,
I'm just not in a sexy mood.

800
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,753
Would it help
if I put my lens in?

801
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,150
<i>Is that what's bothering you?</i>

802
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,833
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

803
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,399
I'm sure I'll get used
to you without it,

804
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,598
but at the moment it's...

805
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,000
I don't know.

806
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,356
<i>It's a little strange.</i>

807
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,478
No big deal.
The kid aims to please.

808
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,549
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

809
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,872
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

810
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,110
- I'm really sorry.
- Mmm.

811
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,157
Come, let's go to bed.

812
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,876
Oh, honey, the shutters.

813
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,951
Oh, jeez.

814
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,356
<i>What's wrong?</i>

815
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,230
Brent, what is it?

816
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,800
<i>- A headache.
- Oh, come on, baby.</i>

817
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,234
- Oh!
- Lie down.

818
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,993
Okay?

819
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,229
Gently, gently.

820
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,720
Easy.

821
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,599
- Ohh.
- Is that better?

822
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,910
Yeah, I think so.

823
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,434
I think it's goin' away.

824
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,911
A little too much excitement
on the first night, huh?

825
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,311
Yeah, you may be right.
Oh, that feels good.

826
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,440
Let's just go to sleep, hmm?

827
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,638
- Yeah, oh, just keep doin' that.
- Okay.

828
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,357
<i>Honey, breakfast.</i>

829
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,994
- Did you do your eye exercises?
- Mm-hm.

830
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,957
Listen, I have to get to work.
Are you okay?

831
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,110
- Yeah.
- Okay.

832
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,600
If you feel like it, why don't you take
a crack at putting the crib together?

833
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,195
Because I got the back yard
to work on! Okay?

834
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,191
You don't have to yell.

835
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,274
Did I?

836
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,839
I'm sorry.

837
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,112
Our baby will hear you.

838
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,356
There's my ride.
Bye.

839
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,680
- Mm.
- See ya.

840
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,440
No!

841
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,152
Make a joyful noise
unto the Lord, all ye lands.

842
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,117
Know ye that
the Lord he is God.

843
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,514
Brent?

844
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,670
Brent?

845
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,034
Hey, darlin'.

846
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,111
Come on up.
Got something to show ya.

847
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,278
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

848
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,473
- Hi, sweetie.
- Mm.

849
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,550
You're in a good mood.

850
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,074
- Well, feelin' better, come on.
- Good.

851
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,150
Oh.

852
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,480
My handyman.

853
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,119
Yeah, it's pretty nifty, huh?

854
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,874
What about the sides?

855
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,758
I was about to do that.

856
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,640
There.

857
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,799
There.

858
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,912
Jesus Christ!

859
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,199
You took your diapers
off again.

860
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,635
Look at this mess.

861
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,030
You make everything so hard
for me, you--

862
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,957
What is it, what's wrong?

863
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,112
Oh, oh, Brent,
honey, what's the matter?

864
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,474
Oh, my God!

865
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,790
Well, can't he be reached
at home?

866
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,440
I don't care where he is,
I just need to talk to him.

867
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,552
No, no, no, it's my husband.

868
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,996
Well, I don't know,
it's an emergency.

869
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,833
Uh, he's not dying,
if that's what you mean.

870
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,558
Hey, I'm feelin' a little better.

871
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,358
Oh, hold on a moment, please.

872
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,352
Oh, I don't know, you look so--

873
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,192
I mean, I really think
you should see someone.

874
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,112
Oh, no, I really am feelin' better.

875
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,316
Just tell 'em
I'll call him tomorrow.

876
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,960
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

877
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,599
Hello?

878
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,991
No, no, don't bother,
we'll call him in the morning.

879
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,229
Thank you.

880
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,358
Mm, I'm feeling much better.

881
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,829
Do you know what would
make me feel better still?

882
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,718
<i>- Brent.
- What?</i>

883
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,150
Look what you did, you bit me.
I'm bleeding.

884
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,635
Ohh--.

885
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,873
I see things.

886
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,394
What things?

887
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,357
Just, leave me alone.

888
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,839
Leave me alone!

889
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,394
<i>He gnashes upon me with his eye.</i>

890
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,030
<i>Mine enemy sharpened
his eyes upon me.</i>

891
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,351
<i>They have gaped upon me
with his mouth.</i>

892
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,239
They have gathered themselves
together against me.

893
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:20,234
God hath delivered me
to the ungodly

894
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,756
and turned me over
into the hands of the wicked.

895
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,990
He hath also
taken me by my neck

896
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,029
<i>and shaken me to pieces
and set me up for his mark.</i>

897
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,476
<i>His archers compass me
roundabout.</i>

898
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,599
<i>He cleaveth my reins asunder
and doth not spare.</i>

899
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,071
<i>He poureth out my gall
upon the ground.</i>

900
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,471
<i>He breaketh me
with breach upon breach.</i>

901
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,154
<i>He runneth upon me
like a giant.</i>

902
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:51,039
<i>I have sewed sackcloth
upon my skin</i>

903
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,794
<i>and defiled my horn
in the dust.</i>

904
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,030
<i>My face is foul
with weeping</i>

905
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,033
<i>and on my eyelids
is the shadow of death.</i>

906
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,872
<i>Therefore rejoice...</i>

907
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,711
The sky were darkened
by the smoke from the abyss.

908
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,710
I told you to leave me alone!

909
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,634
Why can't you do
what I ask you to do?

910
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,511
Please, Brent,
go see the doctor.

911
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,399
Yes, will he help?
Will he help me?

912
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,835
Will the doctor help me?

913
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,035
I'll drive you.

914
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,077
No, the keys.

915
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,514
Where are the keys?

916
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,557
<i>Downstairs on the table.</i>

917
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,959
What have you done to me?

918
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,749
Oh, uh, Brent, aren't I supposed
to see you this afternoon?

919
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,910
What have you done to me?

920
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,552
I don't know
what you're talking about.

921
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,119
What's happenin' to me?

922
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,680
Are you outta your mind?
Calm down.

923
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,320
This eye, this eye!

924
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,438
Where in the hell
did this eye come from?

925
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,992
Wh-- wh-- wh--
what does it matter?

926
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,150
Tell me!

927
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,632
Well, it, uh, from a man--
a man who died.

928
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,790
How did he die?

929
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,231
He-- he was executed.
He died in the gas chamber.

930
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,953
Well, who was he?

931
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,360
Tell me!

932
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,955
Uh, Randall-- John Randall.

933
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,911
Here we are--
John Randall.

934
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,799
Just move this
and it scans the entire text.

935
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,553
Let me know
if you need anymore help.

936
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,197
Apparently,
Randall had attempted

937
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,160
to get rid of the bodies
in his kitchen garbage disposal.

938
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:25,356
Ultimately, the dismembered remains
of seven young women

939
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,990
were discovered
in shallow graves.

940
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,596
All the victims had died
as a result of stab wounds

941
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,479
administered by a pair
of garden shears.

942
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:41,671
Each of the women
had been sexually molested

943
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,633
after death.

944
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,116
Subsequent investigation
into Randall's past

945
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,750
uncovered a childhood
marked by physical abuse

946
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,357
at the hands of an...
alcoholic mother.

947
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,351
Police were struck
by the fact that

948
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,115
Randall's mother, like all the victims,
had blonde hair.

949
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,120
In conversations with police,

950
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,589
Randall referred to himself as...

951
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,438
the Devil.

952
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,989
Brent?

953
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,557
Brent?

954
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,114
I'm out here.

955
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,479
What did the doctor say?

956
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,870
Oh, nothin' to worry about.

957
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:01,029
Could you please stop diggin'.
I need to talk to you.

958
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,915
I can't.

959
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,233
I have to finish
diggin' your grave.

960
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,917
Whore!

961
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,429
What are you doing?
No, get off me!

962
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,197
Get off me!

963
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,194
This is the John Randall, dear.

964
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,793
He chose them by their hair!

965
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,998
John Randall.
John Randall.

966
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,789
John Randall, John Randall,
John Randall, John Randall!

967
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,111
Randall, Randall,
John Randall.

968
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,589
He cut 'em up, you see?

969
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,430
John woulda liked you.

970
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,397
I have his eye, you know.

971
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,551
I see what John Randall saw.

972
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:00,556
And it's so damn satisfying.

973
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,520
<i>Brent, the bible,
look at the bible.</i>

974
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,716
He makes 'em soft.

975
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,680
They're hair is soft, but it-
They're whores!

976
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,271
So, we have to make 'em soft.

977
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,271
And then we can have 'em.

978
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,273
But then they get cold and, uh--

979
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,718
Oh, John, he doesn't like that.

980
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,315
Grind 'em up.
That's what we do.

981
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,755
But they're too big.

982
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,877
Big and ugly.

983
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,200
And so we dig.

984
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,874
Put 'em in the ground
and make 'em quiet.

985
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,079
Oh, John, he knew
what was good.

986
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,152
Brent, the bible,
look at the bible.

987
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,319
What is in the bible?

988
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,870
- John Randall's in the bible.
- John Randall's not in the bible!

989
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,792
That Brent, Brent's in the bible!

990
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,279
That's right, Brent's in the bible.

991
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,915
No, I-- I-- I mean that--

992
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:58,231
That's right, you said
Brent's in the bible.

993
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,679
No, that's not what I mean.

994
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:04,116
Yes, look, it says it
in the bible.

995
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:08,709
<i>From Cathy to Brent,
our faith in thee.</i>

996
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,151
Shut up!
Whore!

997
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,311
No.

998
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,880
To Brent from Cathy,

999
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:21,316
may we always
walk together with God.

1000
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,838
<i>♪ I got my eye on you baby ♪</i>

1001
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,877
<i>♪ Oh yeah. ♪</i>

1002
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,998
Oh, sorry, I couldn't resist.

1003
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,479
So, what do you think?

1004
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,313
Myself, I love stories
about our national pastime--

1005
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,152
violent death.

1006
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,840
Ooh.

1007
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,831
What I don't understand is,

1008
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,639
why was he so upset
about losing his eye?

1009
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,677
You could have become
an umpire.

1010
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,391
Uh-oh, better get movin'.

1011
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,034
Oh!

1012
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,430
Oohoo,
it's freezin' in here.

1013
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,794
Mighty-night.

1014
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,915
Oh, man it looks like we got
our work cut out for us tonight.

1015
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,513
Man, you ain't lyin'.

1016
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,715
Might as well get started.

1017
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,674
Another John Doe, huh?

1018
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,434
Ooh, severe, uh, trauma
to the abdomen, I'd say.

1019
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,113
Really, what's your first clue?

1020
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,555
Here, give me that saw.

1021
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,871
Ooh, hey, I'm gonna get
some coffee, man.

1022
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,871
- Hey, get me some too, buddy.
- You bet.

1023
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,354
You know,
these guys crack me up.

1024
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,000
You gotta love 'em.
Oop, gotta run.

1025
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,189
That's not good.

1026
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,630
Well, look at your liver, buddy.

1027
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,519
What the hell you been drinkin',
formaldehyde?

1028
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,476
How's it coming?

1029
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,280
Give me the head saw.
