00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:37,560
My father's name was John Kinsella.
It's an lrish name.

2
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:40,322
He was born in North Dakota in 1896...

3
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:41,920
...and neversaw a big city...

4
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:45,158
...until he came back from France in 1918.

5
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:49,521
He settled in Chicago, where he learned
to live and die with the White Sox.

6
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,800
Died a little
when they lost the 1919 World Series...

7
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,120
...died a lot the following summer
when eight teammates...

8
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:58,402
...were accused of throwing that Series.

9
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,838
He played some in the minors,
but nothing came ofit.

10
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,244
Moved to Brooklyn in '35...

11
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:06,483
...married Mom in '38...

12
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:09,001
...was already an old man
at the naval yards...

13
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,123
...when I was born in 1952.

14
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,844
My name's Ray Kinsella.

15
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:18,479
Mom died when I was 3,
and I suppose Dad did the best he could.

16
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:23,676
Instead of Mother Goose, I was put to bed
to stories of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...

17
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:26,235
...and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson.

18
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:30,402
Dad was a Yankees fan then,
so I rooted for Brooklyn.

19
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:35,038
Butin '58, the Dodgers moved away,
so we had to find other reasons to fight.

20
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:36,242
We did.

21
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,363
When it came time to go to college...

22
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,756
...l picked the farthest
from home I could find.

23
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,921
This drove him up the wall,
which, I suppose, was the point.

24
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:50,360
Officially my major was English,
but really it was the '60s.

25
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,116
I marched, I smoked some grass...

26
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,643
...l tried to like sitar music,
and I metAnnie.

27
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:00,723
The only thing we had in common
was thatshe came from lowa...

28
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,604
...and I'd once heard of lowa.

29
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,717
After graduation,
we moved to the Midwest...

30
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,401
...and stayed with her family
as long as we could.

31
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,364
Almost a full afternoon.

32
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,966
Annie and I got married in June of '74.

33
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:16,084
Dad died that fall.

34
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,917
A few years later, Karin was born.

35
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:21,123
She smelled weird,
but we loved her anyway.

36
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:25,521
Then Annie got the crazy idea
thatshe could talk me into buying a farm.

37
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:30,037
I'm 36 years old, I love my family,
I love baseball...

38
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,641
...and I'm about to become a farmer.

39
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,357
But until I heard the voice...

40
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,998
...l'd never done a crazy thing
in my whole life.

41
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,998
Ifyou build it, he will come.

42
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,398
Ifyou build it, he will come.

43
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,200
Hey, Annie!

44
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:52,326
-Annie, what was that?
-What was what?

45
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,796
That voice just now. What was it?

46
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,804
We didn't hear anything.

47
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,835
All right.

48
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:13,158
Ifyou build it, he will come.

49
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:21,399
-Okay, you must have heard that!
-Sorry.

50
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,883
Hey, come on in to dinner.

51
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,846
Let's go, pumpkin.

52
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,922
Is there a sound truck on the highway?

53
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:49,805
Nope. Hey, Karin, dinner's ready!

54
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,076
-Kids with a radio?
-Nope.

55
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,402
-Are you really hearing voices?
-Just one.

56
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,200
What did it say?

57
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,677
"If you build it, he will come."

58
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,282
-If you build what, who will come?
-He didn't say.

59
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,798
-I hate it when that happens.
-Me, too.

60
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:31,918
Ifyou build it, he will come.

61
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,045
Build what? What is this?

62
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,285
It's okay, honey.

63
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:57,595
I'm just talking to the corn field.

64
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:04,037
Anyway, I was walking
down along the street...

65
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,357
...and I heard this voice saying...

66
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,085
..."Good evening, Mr. Dowd."

67
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,522
Well, I turned around...

68
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:15,042
...and here was this big six-foot rabbit
leaning up against the lamppost.

69
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:23,360
-Why did you do that? It was funny.
-Trust me. It's not funny.

70
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,876
The man is sick. Very sick.

71
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,197
Honey, get your book bag. Let's go!

72
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:32,041
I'll take her today.
I've got some errands to do in town.

73
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,642
Far-out.

74
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:42,679
-What if the voice calls while you're gone?
-Take a message.

75
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:45,363
-'Bye.
-'Bye.

76
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:46,722
'Bye.

77
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:51,315
In all those years, did you ever....

78
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,038
It's just I've heard
that sometimes farmers in the field....

79
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,561
They hear things. You know, voices.

80
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:01,606
-You hearing voices?
-No. It's just I heard some farmers do.

81
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:05,965
I, of course, don't, so I was wondering
if I was doing something wrong.

82
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,521
Did you ever hear voices out there?

83
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:13,997
-Who's hearing voices?
-Ray is. Out in the fields.

84
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:15,440
No, I'm not.

85
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,116
I'm....

86
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,520
Noises.

87
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,803
That darned tractor....

88
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:28,082
I'm just going to get some 3-in-1oil.
That ought to do it.

89
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:31,360
Nice talking to you.

90
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,686
Ifyou build it, he will come.

91
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,999
All right, that's it! Who the....

92
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,921
Who are you? What do you want from me?

93
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,082
Son of a bitch.

94
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,398
Ifyou build it, he will come.

95
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,799
If you build it....

96
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,560
If you build it...

97
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:33,755
...he will come.

98
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:03,480
You don't suppose
this is like an acid flashback?

99
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:05,796
I never took acid.

100
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:09,038
Maybe you will someday.
It's like a flash-forward.

101
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:11,360
Annie, there's more.

102
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:14,041
Honey, why don't you eat a little bit?

103
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:19,079
I think I know what
"If you build it, he will come" means.

104
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,761
Why do I not think
this is such a good thing?

105
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:26,486
I think it means
that if I build a baseball field out there...

106
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:31,076
...Shoeless Joe Jackson
will come back and play ball again.

107
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:34,160
You're kidding?

108
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:42,676
You're kidding.

109
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:47,882
Boy, I thought my family was crazy...

110
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,276
...but this is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

111
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,800
I know it's totally nuts.

112
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:55,596
-I mean, Shoeless Joe!
-He's dead. Died in '51. He's dead.

113
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,247
-They suspended him, right?
-Right.

114
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,838
-He's still dead?
-As far as I know.

115
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,443
Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing?

116
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:11,563
If I did, I've forgotten it.

117
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:20,005
He was supposed to be
so graceful and agile.

118
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,286
I'd actually like to see him play again...

119
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,518
...to let him play, to right an old wrong.

120
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:29,167
Wait. Wait a minute.

121
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:35,639
-Are you actually thinking of doing this?
-No.

122
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:40,476
I can't think of one good reason
why I should, but....

123
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:52,082
I'm 36. I have a wife,
a child, and a mortgage...

124
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,965
...and I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.

125
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,204
What does he have to do with all this?

126
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,647
I never forgave him for getting old.

127
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:08,165
By the time he was as old as I am now...

128
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,325
...he was ancient.

129
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:17,476
He must have had dreams,
but he never did anything about them.

130
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,764
For all I know,
he may have even heard voices, too...

131
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,601
...but he sure didn't listen to them.

132
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:29,720
The man never did one spontaneous thing
in all the years I knew him.

133
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:34,079
I'm afraid of that happening to me...

134
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,286
...and something tells me
this may be my last chance...

135
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,278
...to do something about it.

136
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,443
I want to build that field.

137
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,205
Do you think I'm crazy?

138
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,362
Yes.

139
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:59,924
But I also think
if you really feel you should do this...

140
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,437
...then you should do it.

141
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:21,881
-What the hell is he doing?
-He's plowing under his corn.

142
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,322
Why?

143
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:32,722
Ty Cobb called him
the greatest left fielder of all time.

144
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:36,840
He said his glove
was the place where triples go to die.

145
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,238
-Could he hit?
-Could he hit?

146
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:42,046
Lifetime average .356,
third highest in history.

147
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,039
Why'd they call him "Shoeless Joe"?

148
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,320
When he was in the minors...

149
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:49,126
...he bought a new pair of spikes
and hurt his feet.

150
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:52,836
In the 6th inning, he took them off
and played in his socks.

151
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:57,205
The players kidded him, called him
"Shoeless Joe" and the name stuck.

152
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,685
He's going to lose his farm.

153
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:00,916
Damned fool.

154
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,158
Then in 1919,
his team the Chicago White Sox...

155
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:06,283
...threw the World Series.

156
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,882
-What's "threw"?
-It means they lostit on purpose.

157
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,958
Gamblers paid them to.

158
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:14,197
Except Shoeless Joe.

159
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:17,957
He did take their money,
but nobody everproved he did one thing...

160
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,605
...to lose those games.

161
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:24,960
If he threw it, how do you explain
that he hit .375 for the Series...

162
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:26,799
...and committed no errors?

163
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:27,876
I can't.

164
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,435
Twelve hits including
the Series' only home run...

165
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,757
...and they said he's trying to lose?

166
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:33,962
It's ridiculous.

167
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:37,445
The commissioner of baseball
suspended eight of the players...

168
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:40,439
...including the great Shoeless Joe
Jackson, forlife.

169
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:42,119
What's "suspend"?

170
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:46,199
It means they never
let him play the game again.

171
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,923
My father said he saw him years later...

172
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:55,159
...playing under a made-up name
in some 10th-rate league in Carolina.

173
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:58,644
He'd put on 50 pounds,
and his spring was gone from his step...

174
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,558
...but he could still hit.

175
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:04,683
Dad used to say
nobody could hit like Shoeless Joe.

176
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:08,760
I think that's the first time
I've ever seen you smile...

177
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:11,156
...when you mentioned your father.

178
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,604
I have just created something
totally illogical.

179
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,197
That's what I like about it.

180
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,319
Am I completely nuts?

181
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,605
Not completely.

182
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:45,276
It's a good baseball field, Ray.

183
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:48,402
It's kind of pretty, isn't it?

184
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,641
Any sign?

185
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:16,966
Something's going to happen out there.

186
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,080
I can feel it.

187
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:41,516
So, for the veteran southpaw,
his summer of woes continues.

188
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,558
That's fourstraight hits in the inning.

189
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:46,286
Daddy, what's a "southpaw"?

190
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,997
It means a left-handed pitcher, honey.

191
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,321
-So how bad is it?
-Well.

192
00:16:56,847 --> 00:17:00,806
Considering how much less acreage
we have for corn, I say we'll probably...

193
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,998
...almost break even.

194
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,686
We used up all our savings on that field.

195
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,761
-Daddy?
-Just a minute, Karin.

196
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,165
So what are you saying?
We can't keep the field?

197
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,407
Makes it real hard to keep the farm.

198
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:33,037
-Daddy.
-In a minute, Karin!

199
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,243
There's a man out there on your lawn.

200
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:25,483
I'll put up some coffee.
Why don't you go on outside?

201
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:19,796
Sorry.

202
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,403
I'll get some out there.

203
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:55,922
Hi.

204
00:20:57,807 --> 00:20:59,035
Ray Kinsella.

205
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,680
Joe Jackson.

206
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,485
I bet it's good to be playing again.

207
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,356
Getting thrown out of baseball...

208
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,520
...was like having part of me amputated.

209
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,562
I've heard that old men wake up...

210
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:53,606
...and scratch itchy legs
that have been dust for over 50 years.

211
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:55,840
That was me.

212
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:59,283
I'd wake up at night...

213
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:03,324
...with the smell
of the ballpark in my nose...

214
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:07,039
...with the cool of the grass on my feet...

215
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,243
...the thrill of the grass.

216
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,080
Can you pitch?

217
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,082
Yeah.

218
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:25,876
Not bad.

219
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,677
-Don't we need a catcher?
-Not if you get it near the plate.

220
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:47,722
Right.

221
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:02,236
I'm pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.

222
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:11,956
Nice hit.

223
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:28,199
See if you can hit my curve.

224
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:41,726
-You can hit the curve ball.
-Put one right here.

225
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:44,922
Right.

226
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:00,238
Right, you're a low-ball hitter.

227
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,997
Man, I did love this game.

228
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,557
I'd have played for food money.

229
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:12,436
It was the game, the sounds, the smells.

230
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:18,839
Did you ever hold a ball
or a glove to your face?

231
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:20,836
Yeah.

232
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:25,155
I used to love traveling on the trains
from town to town.

233
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:30,760
The hotels, brass spittoons in the lobbies...

234
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:33,122
...brass beds in the rooms.

235
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:38,965
It was the crowd...

236
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:43,684
...rising to their feet
when the ball was hit deep.

237
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:52,521
I'd play for nothing.

238
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:01,520
It's my family.

239
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:06,765
What's with the lights?

240
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,042
All the stadiums have them now.

241
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:13,642
-Even Wrigley Field.
-It's harder to see the ball.

242
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:17,237
The owners found that more people
can attend night games.

243
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:18,996
Owners.

244
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:35,445
Mr. Jackson, this is my wife Annie
and my daughter Karin.

245
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,316
Ma'am.

246
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,839
Are you a ghost?

247
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,801
-She's kidding.
-That's okay.

248
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:50,722
-What do you think?
-You look real to me.

249
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:52,805
Then I guess I'm real.

250
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,723
Would you like to come inside?

251
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:58,762
Thanks. I don't think I can.

252
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:09,006
Can I come back again?

253
00:26:10,207 --> 00:26:13,722
Yeah. I built this for you.

254
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:19,523
There are others, you know.

255
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:24,284
There were eight of us.
It would really mean a lot to them.

256
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:29,278
Yeah. Anytime. They're all welcome here.

257
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,326
Is this heaven?

258
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:43,762
No.

259
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:46,796
It's lowa.

260
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:56,764
-Where's he going?
-I don't know.

261
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,645
We're keeping this field.

262
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,919
You bet your ass we are.

263
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:19,723
-You're going to lose your farm, pal.
-How can you lose something so big?

264
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,283
-He misplaced the house once.
-Yeah, but it turned up two days later.

265
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,917
Come on. Ray?

266
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:29,278
This stupid baseball field will bankrupt you.
Everybody knows it.

267
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,725
If you default on your loan,
you'll lose everything.

268
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:35,560
If you sell now,
my partners will give you a fair price.

269
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:39,283
-Thanks, Mark, but no.
-No.

270
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:42,116
What are you holding onto this place for?

271
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:45,279
-You never liked lowa.
-That's not true.

272
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,757
You never liked farming. It is true.
You don't know about farming.

273
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:51,680
I know a lot about farming.
More than you think.

274
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:54,884
Well, then how could you plow
under your major crop?

275
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:57,202
What's a crop?

276
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,484
-Come on. That is funny.
-"What's a crop?"

277
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:06,922
-Daddy, the baseball game is on.
-Excuse us.

278
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,436
Excuse us.

279
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,884
Annie, I don't believe this guy.

280
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,845
I'm trying to bail him out,
and he leaves to watch television.

281
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:22,638
-He used to be so normal.
-Yeah.

282
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,483
Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!

283
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,800
All right!

284
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:13,836
Watch Joe's feet.

285
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:18,436
A good left fielder
knows what pitch is coming.

286
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:22,436
He can tell from the bat's angle
which way the ball's heading.

287
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:28,645
-Show off!
-Stick it in your ear, Gandil.

288
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:33,636
If you'd have run like that against Detroit,
I'd have won 20 games that year!

289
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:37,836
For Pete's sakes, Cicotte,
that was 68 years ago. Give it up!

290
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:42,045
Hey! You guys want to play ball or what?

291
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:45,958
-Muscle-bound jerk.
-Oh, yeah? At least I got muscles.

292
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:50,245
-At most, you got muscles.
-Come on, asshole! Pitch!

293
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,677
Weaver, be nice.

294
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:59,838
-Sorry, kid!
-It's okay. I don't mind.

295
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:03,200
-All right, Karin.
-Hey, hey, hey!

296
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,438
Mom and everybody are leaving now.

297
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:24,238
Oh, well, it was....
You know. Thanks for coming.

298
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:29,116
Think about what I said.
I'm just trying to help.

299
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:30,556
I know.

300
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:32,844
Thought you were watching some game.

301
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:36,321
It's not really a game.
It's more like practice.

302
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,766
There are only eight of them.
They can't play a real game.

303
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:50,842
-Eight of what?
-Them.

304
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,159
-Who "them"?
-Them them.

305
00:30:56,887 --> 00:31:00,562
-You don't see them?
-Karin, honey, what are you watching?

306
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:04,279
-The baseball men.
-Baseball men?

307
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,843
-Do you see the baseball men right now?
-Of course, I do.

308
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:16,166
You really don't see them?

309
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:20,399
I don't think it's very polite
to try to make other people feel stupid.

310
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:24,437
Mom, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

311
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:27,560
Dee, wait. You don't see these people?

312
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:29,319
It's not funny, Annie.

313
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,360
They couldn't see it.

314
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,638
This is really interesting.

315
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:52,920
Hey, Ray, look at this.

316
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:56,477
68 years since I wore this uniform,
still fits me like a glove.

317
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,763
You must keep in pretty good shape.

318
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,678
Now let's see, I died in '70.

319
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:06,283
That means I haven't had
a cigarette in 18 years.

320
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:08,877
-You don't smoke, do you?
-No.

321
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:12,477
Karin! Ray! Dinner!

322
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:15,677
"Ray, dinner."

323
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,837
-All right.
-Come on. Let's hit the showers.

324
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:21,800
See you later.

325
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,239
See you, guys.

326
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:37,365
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"

327
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:39,759
Come on, you knucklehead.

328
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,517
That is so cool.

329
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:50,759
-Ease his pain.
-What?

330
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,799
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't understand. What?

331
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,398
Ease his pain.

332
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:03,041
"Ease his pain."
What the hell does that mean?

333
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:05,641
"Ease his pain"? What pain?

334
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:08,443
All right. Whose pain?

335
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:15,841
Thanks a lot.

336
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:18,880
Thanks a lot.

337
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:29,158
Come on, honey, wash up.
We got the PTA meeting after dinner.

338
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:31,124
They're talking about banning books again.

339
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:35,883
Really subversive books like
The Wizard of Oz, The Diary ofAnne Frank.

340
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,567
-What happened to you?
-The voice is back.

341
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:42,482
Oh, Lord! You don't have to build
a football field now, do you?

342
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,398
He said, "Ease his pain."

343
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:48,002
-Ease whose pain?
-I asked him. He wouldn't tell me.

344
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:50,636
-Shoeless Joe's?
-I don't think so.

345
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:54,201
-One of the other players?
-I don't think so.

346
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:58,724
This is a very nonspecific voice out there,
and he's starting to piss me off.

347
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:04,005
I was having a fun day today. A good day.

348
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:05,801
Want a fry?

349
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:16,439
And I say smut and filth like this
has no place in our schools.

350
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:23,725
Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain.

351
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:28,315
Mrs. Kessinik, that book
you're waving about is hardly smut.

352
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:33,119
It's considered by many critics
to be the classic novel about the 1960s.

353
00:34:33,247 --> 00:34:37,320
-It's pornography!
-No. The Supreme Court says it's not.

354
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:40,439
-And it's author, Mr. Mann--
-Is sick!

355
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,956
Terence Mann is a Pulitzer Prize winner.

356
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:46,397
He's widely regarded
as the finest satirist of his time.

357
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:49,843
Yeah, well, I think he's a pervert!
Probably a communist, too!

358
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,077
What planet are these people from?

359
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:56,557
The so-called novels of Terence Mann...

360
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,719
...endorse promiscuity, godlessness...

361
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:04,164
...the mongrelization of the races,
and disrespect to high-ranking officers...

362
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:06,198
...of the United States Army.

363
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,842
And that's why
right-thinking school boards...

364
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:14,364
...all across the country
have been banning this man's s-h-i-t...

365
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:16,763
...since 1969.

366
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:20,400
Terence Mann?

367
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:28,520
You know why he stopped writing books?
Because he masturbates.

368
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,315
Excuse me, madam.

369
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,042
Excuse me.

370
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:40,643
Terence Mann was a warm
and gentle voice of reason...

371
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:42,285
...during a time of great madness.

372
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:46,965
He coined the phrase,
"Make love, not war."

373
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:51,840
While other people chanted, "Burn,
baby, burn," he was talking about love...

374
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:53,804
...and peace and understanding.

375
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:58,405
I cherished every one of his books,
and I dearly wish he had written more.

376
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:03,206
Maybe if you had experienced
even a little bit of the '60s...

377
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:05,959
...you might feel the same way, too.

378
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:10,680
I experienced the '60s.

379
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:14,997
No, you had two '50s
and moved right into the '70s.

380
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,206
Annie, look at this.

381
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,437
Your husband plowed under his corn
and built a baseball field.

382
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:27,677
-Now, there's an intelligent response.
-The weirdo.

383
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:32,640
-Annie.
-Honey, it's all right. I'll be cool.

384
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:37,163
At least he is not a book-burner,
you Nazi cow.

385
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:43,756
At least I'm not married to the biggest
horse's ass in three counties.

386
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:46,562
All right, Beulah,
do you want to step outside?

387
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:48,641
Fine!

388
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:57,197
All right, I've got a better idea.
Let's take a vote. Who's for Eva Braun?

389
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,359
Who wants to burn books?

390
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:04,724
Who wants to spit on the Constitution of
the United States of America? Anybody?

391
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:14,118
All right.
Now, who's for the Bill of Rights?

392
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:17,523
Who thinks freedom
is a pretty darn good thing?

393
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:21,285
Come on! Let's see those hands!

394
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,126
Who thinks we have to stand up...

395
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:29,836
...to the kind of censorship
they had under Stalin?

396
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:47,679
All right. There you go.
America, I love you. I'm proud of you.

397
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:50,004
-We got to go.
-We got to go.

398
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:51,361
This is great!

399
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:54,278
I figured it out.

400
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:57,206
Was that great, or what?

401
00:37:57,287 --> 00:37:59,676
-I figured it out.
-It's just like the '60s again!

402
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:02,042
-I figured it out.
-Step outside, you Nazi cow.

403
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:07,121
-I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease.
-What?

404
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:10,205
I just halted the spread
of neofascism in America--

405
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,118
-Terence Mann.
-What about him?

406
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,516
-That's whose pain.
-How do you know that?

407
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:15,636
I just know.

408
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,917
I was right about building the field,
wasn't l?

409
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,838
-Yes. What's his pain?
-I don't know.

410
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,566
-How are you supposed to ease it?
-I don't know.

411
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:26,439
Look, he's my favorite writer, too...

412
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:29,599
...but what's Terence Mann
got to do with baseball?

413
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,801
It's incredible. By the early '70s,
the guy decides people have become...

414
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:02,276
...either too extremist
or too apathetic to listen.

415
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:08,124
So he stops writing books,
he starts writing poetry about whales...

416
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:11,404
...and then he starts fooling around
with a home computer.

417
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:13,318
Know what he does now?

418
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:15,836
He writes software
for interactive children's videos.

419
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:19,681
They teach kids
how to resolve their conflicts peacefully.

420
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:23,243
-God, what an amazing guy.
-What's that got to do with baseball?

421
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:26,036
In the April 1962 issue of Jet magazine...

422
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:29,403
...there's a story called
"This ls Not A Kite."

423
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:35,086
It's not his best work, but the story's hero
is named John Kinsella.

424
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,680
-My father.
-Wow.

425
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:38,796
What do you mean, "Wow"?

426
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:43,119
What should I say? Big wow!
What's it got to do with baseball?

427
00:39:43,207 --> 00:39:44,356
You drive.

428
00:39:49,527 --> 00:39:52,405
Okay, the last interview
he ever gave was in 1973.

429
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:55,240
-Guess what it's about.
-Some kind of team sport.

430
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:58,281
The guy was a baseball fanatic.
Listen to this:

431
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:01,837
"As a child, my earliest recurring dream
was to play at Ebbets Field...

432
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:04,157
"...with Jackie Robinson
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.

433
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:06,841
"Of course, it never happened.
The Dodgers left Brooklyn.

434
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:11,079
"They tore down Ebbets Field,
but even now, I still dream that dream."

435
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:12,596
That's sad.

436
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:17,840
The man wrote the best books
of his generation.

437
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:22,322
He was a pioneer in the civil rights
and the antiwar movement.

438
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:26,366
He made the cover of Newsweek.
He knew everybody. He did everything.

439
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:30,201
He helped shape his time.
The guy hung out with The Beatles.

440
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:33,121
It wasn't enough.
What he missed was baseball.

441
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:35,084
-Oh, my God!
-What?

442
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,806
As a small boy,
he had a bat named Rosebud.

443
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:39,799
-Give me that.
-Sorry.

444
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:43,916
The guy hasn't been
to a baseball game since 1958.

445
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,916
So, to ease his pain, you're supposed
to take him to a ball game.

446
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:48,996
Yes.

447
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,875
Ray, this is nuttier
than building the baseball field.

448
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:56,721
No, it's not. It's pretty weird,
but building the field was weirder.

449
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:58,286
Five, ten percent weirder.

450
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,927
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to nip this one in the bud.

451
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:04,158
We're having moderate to heavy
financial difficulties here.

452
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:07,398
You can't take off for Boston
while we're going broke in lowa.

453
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:09,563
This is really new territory for us...

454
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:12,201
...but we're dealing
with primal forces of nature.

455
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:15,006
When primal forces of nature tell you
to do something...

456
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:18,159
-...it's not prudent to quibble over details.
-Why do you have to go?

457
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,762
Why can't the voice send somebody else?
How about Shirley MacLaine?

458
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:25,641
Is she too busy?
What does this have to do with you?

459
00:41:25,727 --> 00:41:27,683
That's what I have to find out.

460
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:30,042
We are behind on the mortgage.

461
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:33,164
That field ate up all of our savings.
We could lose this farm.

462
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:36,717
I won't even stay in motels.
I'll sleep in the car. I'll beg for food.

463
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:39,685
No. Now, this is too much.

464
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:45,120
I understand your need to prove
to yourself and to the world...

465
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:48,085
...you are not turning into your father,
but you have.

466
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,886
You believed in the magic.
It happened. Isn't that enough?

467
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,527
It's more than that.
I know this is totally nuts...

468
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:56,644
...but there's another reason
I'm supposed to do it.

469
00:41:56,727 --> 00:42:00,766
I feel it as strongly as I've felt anything
in my life. There's a reason.

470
00:42:00,847 --> 00:42:03,361
What? Just tell me what it is.

471
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:07,526
Something's going to happen at the game.
There's something at Fenway Park.

472
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:10,758
I got to be there
with Terence Mann to find it out.

473
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:15,641
Is Fenway the one
with the big green wall in left field?

474
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:17,715
Yeah.

475
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:22,039
I dreamt last night
you were at Fenway with Terence Mann.

476
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:25,517
-Was I sitting on the first base side?
-Yes.

477
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:27,844
About halfway up on the aisle?

478
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:30,361
-Yeah. Eating a hot dog.
-Eating a hot dog.

479
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,644
-I had the same dream.
-I'll help you pack.

480
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:02,166
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.

481
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:04,246
Hi. No.

482
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:08,679
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
It's a great pleasure to finally get to....

483
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:11,606
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella. I'm a big fan of yours.

484
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:12,917
Hi.

485
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:20,160
How do you do, Mr. Mann?
I have to take you to a base....

486
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:25,196
All right, stupid,
put your hands up and get in the trunk.

487
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:27,039
Good.

488
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,965
He lives right around here.
Do you know him?

489
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:35,838
He's sort of a tall black man.
I'm a friend of his.

490
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:40,644
If he was much of a friend,
he'd have given you the directions himself.

491
00:43:43,127 --> 00:43:45,357
That's a good point. Thank you.

492
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,763
I don't know where he lives.
Get away from me.

493
00:43:50,847 --> 00:43:55,284
I ain't going to tell you nothing.
Go away. You're a pest.

494
00:43:59,527 --> 00:44:01,677
Two blocks down, right-hand side.

495
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:05,157
First door that doesn't have
a chicken in the window is his.

496
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:06,686
No chicken.

497
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:50,756
Who the hell are you?

498
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:56,120
Sir, my name's Ray Kinsella.

499
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:19,446
-We got a learning disability here?
-If I could just have one minute, please.

500
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:24,045
I can't tell you the secret of life,
and I don't have any answers for you.

501
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:27,677
I don't give interviews,
and I'm no longer a public figure.

502
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:30,720
I just want to be left alone, so piss off.

503
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,558
Wait! Wait!

504
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:36,323
I've come 1,500 miles to see you...

505
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:39,922
...at the risk of losing my home
and alienating my wife.

506
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:44,040
All I'm asking is one minute. Please.

507
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,202
One minute.

508
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:01,125
I understand your desire for privacy...

509
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:04,925
...and I wouldn't intrude
if this weren't extremely important.

510
00:46:05,407 --> 00:46:08,922
Oh, God. I don't do causes anymore.

511
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:13,275
This isn't a cause.
I don't need money or an endorsement.

512
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:14,881
Refreshing.

513
00:46:15,287 --> 00:46:17,243
You once wrote, "There comes a time...

514
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:20,160
"...when all the cosmic tumblers
have clicked into place...

515
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:23,045
"...and the universe
opens itself up for a few seconds...

516
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:24,879
"...to show you what's possible."

517
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,245
-Oh, my God!
-What?

518
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:31,525
-You're from the '60s.
-Well, yeah. Actually--

519
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:34,166
Out!

520
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,398
Back to the '60s!
There's no place for you here in the future.

521
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:39,125
Get back while you still can!

522
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:44,602
You've changed, you know that?

523
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:49,246
Yes, I suppose I have.
How about this? Peace, love, dope.

524
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:51,045
Now get the hell out of here!

525
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:37,598
-You've really pissed me off.
-Just hold it right there.

526
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:39,639
I didn't want to do it this way.

527
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:43,203
-What the hell is that?
-It's a gun, what do you think it is?

528
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,801
-It's your finger.
-No, it's a gun.

529
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:49,198
-Let me see it.
-I'm not going to show you my gun.

530
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:53,077
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just need you to come with me....

531
00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:55,556
What are you doing?

532
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:58,515
I'll beat you with a crowbar
until you go away.

533
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:00,803
Wait! You can't do that.

534
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:04,443
There are rules here?
Oh, no. There are no rules here.

535
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:07,005
You're a pacifist!

536
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:13,001
Shit.

537
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:15,558
Thank you.

538
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:19,918
So, what? You're kidnapping me?
What's the deal here?

539
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:26,567
I was hoping I could just convince you
to come with me.

540
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:28,160
So you are kidnapping me?

541
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:32,361
I have to take you to a baseball game.

542
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:33,916
You what?

543
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:37,440
Tonight's game. Red Sox, A's.

544
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,002
Why?

545
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:41,560
Something will happen there.

546
00:48:41,647 --> 00:48:44,719
I don't know what,
but we'll find out when it does.

547
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:48,356
My name's Ray Kinsella.

548
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:52,235
You used my father's name
for a character in one of your stories.

549
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:53,362
John Kinsella.

550
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:56,606
You're seeing a whole team
of psychiatrists, aren't you?

551
00:48:56,727 --> 00:49:01,084
I don't blame you for thinking that,
but no, I'm not.

552
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:05,078
I swear to God,
I'm the least crazy person I've ever known.

553
00:49:05,727 --> 00:49:08,605
Why are you kidnapping me
to a baseball game?

554
00:49:09,687 --> 00:49:13,362
-May l?
-Oh, please. Want a cup of coffee?

555
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:15,796
No.

556
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:17,759
Want some cookies?

557
00:49:19,487 --> 00:49:20,602
No.

558
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:23,718
I read an interview you gave...

559
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:26,685
...about how you always dreamed
of playing at Ebbets Field...

560
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:29,565
...and how sad you felt
when they tore it down.

561
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:30,836
I never said that.

562
00:49:32,047 --> 00:49:33,116
You didn't?

563
00:49:33,447 --> 00:49:35,642
I don't even recall thinking that.

564
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:41,396
Weird.

565
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:49,322
This whole thing is so weird.

566
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,283
Then why go through with it?

567
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,845
It's a long story.

568
00:50:02,287 --> 00:50:05,916
But it's a really good story.
I'll tell you on the way.

569
00:50:06,447 --> 00:50:08,836
-I'm not getting rid of you, am l?
-No.

570
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:13,159
If you come to this game with me,
I swear I'll never bother you again.

571
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:15,683
Not even a Christmas card.

572
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,278
So what do you do with yourself
these days?

573
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:29,484
I live, I work. I learned how to cook.

574
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:33,001
I take walks and watch sunsets.

575
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:36,158
Don't you miss being involved?

576
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:39,599
I was the East Coast distributor
of involved.

577
00:50:40,127 --> 00:50:42,800
I ate it and drank it and breathed it.

578
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:45,646
Then they killed Martin, and Bobby...

579
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:48,642
...they elected Tricky Dick twice...

580
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:51,406
...and now people like you think
I must be miserable...

581
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:54,797
...because I'm not involved anymore.
I've got news for you.

582
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:57,196
I spent all my misery years ago.

583
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,241
I have no more pain left for any of you.
I gave at the office.

584
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:04,684
So what do you want?

585
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:07,561
I want them to stop
looking to me for answers...

586
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,798
...begging me to speak again,
write again, be a leader.

587
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:13,242
I want them to start thinking
for themselves.

588
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:15,158
And I want my privacy.

589
00:51:16,327 --> 00:51:19,444
No, I meant what do you want?

590
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:27,599
Dog and a beer.

591
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:32,564
-Two.
-$ 7.

592
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,600
Okay, I understand you.

593
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:37,195
You should be entitled
to as much privacy as you want.

594
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:39,198
But why stop writing?

595
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:44,921
I haven't published a word in 17 years,
and still I have to endure lunatics like you.

596
00:51:45,007 --> 00:51:48,477
What do you think would happen
if I suddenly came out with a new book?

597
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,365
They'd bleed me dry.

598
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:06,043
Go the distance.

599
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:16,077
Go the distance.

600
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:36,156
What's the matter?

601
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:42,646
-You didn't see that?
-See what?

602
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:51,797
I'm sorry.
I guess you didn't have to be here.

603
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:53,036
What?

604
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:58,555
Whenever you want to go, we can go.

605
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:00,679
Fine. Let's go.

606
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:47,641
What is it you're not telling me?

607
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:51,519
I've already taken up
too much of your time.

608
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,043
I wish I had your passion.

609
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:08,797
Misdirected though it might be,
it is still a passion.

610
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:11,924
I used to feel that way about things, but....

611
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:18,237
-You got another message, didn't you?
-You'll think I'm crazy.

612
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:21,245
I already think you're crazy.
What did it say?

613
00:54:24,647 --> 00:54:27,764
It said, "The man's done enough.
Leave him alone."

614
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:48,965
Moonlight Graham.

615
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:52,601
-You saw it.
-Saw what?

616
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:57,803
You saw it. New York Giants, 1922.
He played one game. He never got to bat.

617
00:54:57,887 --> 00:54:59,445
-You saw it!
-What did I see?

618
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:01,199
Chisholm, Minnesota.

619
00:55:01,287 --> 00:55:04,757
We were the only ones who saw it.
Did you hear the voice, too?

620
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:06,041
It's all right to admit it.

621
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:08,561
It's what told me to find you.
Did you hear it?

622
00:55:10,927 --> 00:55:12,280
"Go the distance"?

623
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:17,480
-Yes. Do you know what it means?
-Yes.

624
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:18,602
What?

625
00:55:18,687 --> 00:55:21,918
It means we're going to Minnesota
to find Moonlight Graham.

626
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:24,965
-We're going.... We?
-I must be out of my mind.

627
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:29,399
-What do we do when we find him?
-How the hell am I supposed to know?

628
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,758
That's right. You're right.

629
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,717
-This is so bitchin'.
-I don't believe I'm doing this.

630
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:56,959
Hey, Annie, guess what?
I'm with Terence Mann.

631
00:55:57,047 --> 00:55:59,003
Oh, my God. You kidnapped him.

632
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:01,436
No, I didn't. He wanted to.

633
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:04,799
I'm really sorry,
but I'm going to be a few days longer.

634
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:06,320
We're going to Minnesota.

635
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:09,080
I don't believe this. What's in Minnesota?

636
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:11,920
An old ballplayer.
I'll explain when I get home.

637
00:56:12,007 --> 00:56:14,805
-How are things with you?
-Fine.

638
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:17,845
Great. Look, Ann, I got to go, okay?

639
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:21,837
Give Karin a hug for me, and I love you.

640
00:56:22,247 --> 00:56:23,680
I love you, too.

641
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,077
Someday explain all this to me, okay?

642
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,397
I'll try. Bye-bye.

643
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,556
'Bye.

644
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:38,726
Why didn't you tell him?

645
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:43,803
You got no choice in the matter.

646
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:53,123
Half a dozen Grahams.
No Archibald. No Moonlight.

647
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:56,041
Follow me.

648
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:08,755
Hello.

649
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:11,919
Excuse me. Maybe you can help us.

650
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:14,840
We're looking for an ex-baseball player,
Archibald Graham.

651
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:18,837
-Oh, you mean Doc Graham.
-No, I think his nickname was "Moonlight."

652
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:21,767
-That's Dr. Graham.
-Dr. Graham?

653
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:26,120
His baseball career never amounted
to much, so he went back to school.

654
00:57:26,207 --> 00:57:27,526
His father was a doctor.

655
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:32,523
-Do you know where we can find him?
-It's nothing bad. We're not from the IRS.

656
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:37,446
Doc Graham is dead. He died in 1972.

657
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:44,357
"At times children could not afford
eyeglasses or milk or clothing.

658
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,806
"Yet no child was ever denied
these essentials...

659
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:50,845
"...because, in the background,
there was always Dr. Graham.

660
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:55,040
"Without any fanfare or publicity,
the glasses or the milk...

661
00:57:55,727 --> 00:57:59,925
"...or the ticket to the ball game
found their way into the child's pocket."

662
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:03,724
-You wrote that.
-The day he died.

663
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:05,160
Can I see that?

664
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:08,683
-You're a good writer.
-So are you.

665
00:58:14,047 --> 00:58:15,685
Something's missing.

666
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,280
He sounds like he was a wonderful man.

667
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:24,564
Half the towns in North America
have a Doc Graham.

668
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:28,482
Why do we have to travel halfway
across the country to find this one...

669
00:58:28,807 --> 00:58:31,037
...sixteen years after he died?

670
00:58:31,687 --> 00:58:33,564
There's got to be more.

671
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:40,196
What else?

672
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:43,156
He always wore an overcoat...

673
00:58:43,247 --> 00:58:46,842
...he had white hair,
and he always carried an umbrella.

674
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,282
What was the umbrella for?

675
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,764
I think it got to be a habit,
something to hang on to.

676
00:58:52,047 --> 00:58:56,086
If you asked him, he said he used it
to beat away his lady admirers.

677
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,686
Tell me about his wife.

678
00:58:58,407 --> 00:58:59,681
Alicia.

679
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:05,046
She moved to South Carolina
after Doc passed.

680
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:08,561
She passed a couple years later.

681
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:11,323
She always wore blue.

682
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:16,605
The shopkeepers in town
would stock blue hats...

683
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:21,558
...because they knew if Doc walked by,
he'd buy one.

684
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:26,041
When they cleaned out his office...

685
00:59:26,127 --> 00:59:28,880
...they found boxes of blue hats...

686
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:33,360
...that he never got around to give her.

687
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:35,319
I'll bet you didn't know that.

688
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:38,442
No, I didn't.

689
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:45,723
No screwing, no drinking,
no opium, no midnight abortions.

690
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:50,402
No illegitimate children, no shady finances.

691
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:53,043
You sound disappointed.

692
00:59:54,087 --> 00:59:57,443
Shoeless Joe had a problem.
That's why he needed you.

693
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,678
This guy doesn't need us.

694
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:05,557
Do you know you're missing?

695
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:11,160
Oh, God.

696
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:16,559
"His father, who lives in Baltimore,
notified police after receiving...

697
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:19,605
"...no answer to repeated telephone calls."
Shoot.

698
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,595
I better call him.

699
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:24,726
-You want me to....
-Thanks.

700
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,721
I'm taking a walk. Be back in a while.

701
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:41,118
What do I tell him?

702
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:08,636
"This year's"?

703
01:01:49,127 --> 01:01:50,640
Dr. Graham?

704
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:00,286
Dr. Graham?

705
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:07,365
My name's Ray Kinsella. I'm from lowa.

706
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,566
Are you Moonlight Graham?

707
01:02:16,687 --> 01:02:19,838
No one's called me Moonlight Graham
in 50 years.

708
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:24,164
I've come a very long way to see you.

709
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,043
I couldn't sleep tonight.
Usually I sleep like a baby.

710
01:02:28,127 --> 01:02:30,243
I told Alicia I was going to take a walk.

711
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:36,276
Do you mind if I join you?
I'd like to talk to you.

712
01:02:37,447 --> 01:02:39,165
Let's walk over to my office.

713
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:42,964
What do you want to talk to me about?

714
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:46,961
When you got to the majors,
you played only one inning of one game.

715
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:49,003
What happened with you?

716
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:52,082
It was the last day of the season.

717
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,476
Bottom of the eighth inning,
we were way ahead.

718
01:02:54,567 --> 01:02:58,640
I'd been up with the club for three weeks,
but I hadn't seen any action.

719
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:01,958
Suddenly old John McGraw
points a bony finger in my direction...

720
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:03,924
...and he says, "Right field."

721
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:07,601
I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring.

722
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:11,521
Grabbed my glove, and ran out on the field.

723
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:16,043
Did you get to make a play?

724
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:18,960
They never hit the ball out of the infield.

725
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:23,040
The game ended. The season was over.

726
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:25,876
I knew they'd send me back down.

727
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:29,564
I couldn't bear the thought
of another year in the minors.

728
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:32,605
So I decided to hang them up.

729
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:37,476
-Go on. Sit down.
-Thank you.

730
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,444
So what was that like?

731
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:46,639
It was like coming this close
to your dreams...

732
01:03:47,007 --> 01:03:50,716
...and then watching them brush past you,
like a stranger in a crowd.

733
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:52,604
At the time, you don't think much of it.

734
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:56,077
We don't recognize our most significant
moments while they're happening.

735
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:59,923
Back then I thought,
"Well, there'll be other days."

736
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,920
I didn't realize that was the only day.

737
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:07,839
And now, I want to ask you a question.

738
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:13,045
What's so interesting about half an inning
that would make you come from lowa...

739
01:04:13,127 --> 01:04:15,880
...to talk to me about it
50 years after it happened.

740
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:19,966
I didn't really know till just now...

741
01:04:20,967 --> 01:04:24,846
...but I think it's to ask you,
if you could do anything you wanted...

742
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:27,276
...if you could have a wish....

743
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:33,998
And you're the kind of man
who could grant me that wish?

744
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:37,841
I don't know. I'm just asking.

745
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:43,640
You know,
I never got to bat in the major leagues.

746
01:04:43,887 --> 01:04:46,685
I'd have liked to have had that chance,
just once...

747
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,122
...to stare down a big-league pitcher.

748
01:04:49,207 --> 01:04:53,359
Stare him down,
then just as he goes into his windup, wink.

749
01:04:53,887 --> 01:04:56,242
Make him think you know
something he doesn't.

750
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:57,999
That's what I wish for.

751
01:04:58,087 --> 01:05:01,875
The chance to squint at a sky so blue
that it hurts your eyes to look at it.

752
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:04,800
To feel the tingle in your arms
as you connect with the ball.

753
01:05:04,887 --> 01:05:07,355
To run the bases,
stretch a double into a triple...

754
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:10,007
...and flop face first into third.

755
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,442
Wrap your arms around the bag.

756
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:14,126
That's my wish.

757
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:20,359
Is there enough magic out there
in the moonlight...

758
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:22,119
...to make this dream come true?

759
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:27,562
-What would you say if I said yes?
-I think I'd actually believe you.

760
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:32,397
There's a place
where things like that happen...

761
01:05:32,487 --> 01:05:34,955
...and if you want to go, I can take you.

762
01:05:39,407 --> 01:05:42,319
This is my most special place
in all the world.

763
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:46,879
Once a place touches you like this,
the wind never blows so cold again.

764
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,723
You feel for it. Like it was your child.

765
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,840
I can't leave Chisholm.

766
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:58,565
I understand. I do.

767
01:06:00,807 --> 01:06:04,356
But I really think
you're supposed to come with us.

768
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:06,316
No.

769
01:06:09,567 --> 01:06:10,716
But your wish?

770
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,964
It'll have to stay a wish.

771
01:06:14,127 --> 01:06:18,166
I was born here, I lived here,
I'll die here, but no regrets.

772
01:06:19,327 --> 01:06:23,559
Fifty years ago, for five minutes,
you came this close.

773
01:06:24,007 --> 01:06:28,523
It would kill some men to get that close
to their dream and not touch it.

774
01:06:29,287 --> 01:06:31,005
They'd consider it a tragedy.

775
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,996
Son, if I'd only gotten to be a doctor
for five minutes...

776
01:06:35,327 --> 01:06:37,238
...now that would have been a tragedy.

777
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:45,046
I better be getting home.
Alicia will think I got a girlfriend.

778
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:47,600
And he smiled.

779
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:54,004
And then I figured, maybe we're not
supposed to take him with us.

780
01:06:54,287 --> 01:06:55,720
I don't know.

781
01:06:57,447 --> 01:07:00,280
I don't know why in the hell
we were supposed to come here.

782
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:04,042
Maybe it's to find out
if one inning can change the world.

783
01:07:04,927 --> 01:07:07,600
-Think it did?
-It did for these people.

784
01:07:07,687 --> 01:07:11,202
If he'd gotten a hit,
he might have stayed in baseball.

785
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:13,160
I don't know.

786
01:07:14,127 --> 01:07:17,483
Your wife called before.
She wants you to call her tonight.

787
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,840
I'm fine. I'm just so glad it's you.

788
01:07:28,287 --> 01:07:31,916
Listen, I talked to the bank...

789
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:35,397
...and I asked them
if we could miss a payment or two...

790
01:07:35,607 --> 01:07:39,361
...and they told me that they had just sold
the note on the farm...

791
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:42,765
...to Mark and his partners.

792
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,639
Right. So they own the paper now.

793
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:49,561
He says if we don't sell to them,
they're going to foreclose.

794
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,637
We don't have the money.

795
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:59,155
Look, I've got to take Mr. Mann
back to Boston first.

796
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:02,319
-No.
-Wait a second.

797
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:04,486
I'm going to lowa with you.

798
01:08:08,327 --> 01:08:09,555
We're coming home.

799
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:16,836
Hell, I can't quit now.
I got to see this ball park.

800
01:08:17,447 --> 01:08:20,041
Not everyone can see it. You might not.

801
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:22,565
Give it a try.

802
01:08:28,327 --> 01:08:30,363
I need all the karma I can get right now.

803
01:08:36,767 --> 01:08:39,918
-Thanks. You're the first car by.
-How far you going?

804
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:42,362
-How far you going?
-Iowa.

805
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:46,355
If it's okay, I'll just ride along a while.
I play baseball.

806
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,998
-Hop in.
-All right.

807
01:08:58,247 --> 01:08:59,999
I'm looking for a place to play.

808
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:03,682
I heard that all through the Midwest,
they have towns with teams.

809
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:07,043
And in some places,
they'll even find you a day job...

810
01:09:07,127 --> 01:09:09,482
...so you can play ball
nights and weekends.

811
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:13,839
This is your lucky day, kid.
We're going someplace kind of like that.

812
01:09:14,447 --> 01:09:15,721
All right.

813
01:09:15,927 --> 01:09:20,205
-I'm Ray Kinsella. This is Terence Mann.
-Hi.

814
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:22,039
I'm Archie Graham.

815
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:37,278
It's funny the way he described towns
finding you a job...

816
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:41,997
...so that you could play on their team.
They haven't done that for years.

817
01:09:42,127 --> 01:09:45,722
My dad did that for a while,
but that was in the '20s.

818
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:47,600
What happened to your father?

819
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:49,879
He never made it as a ballplayer...

820
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:53,004
...so he tried to get his son
to make it for him.

821
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:55,078
By the time I was 10, playing baseball...

822
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:58,716
...got to be like eating vegetables
or taking out the garbage.

823
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,965
So when I was 14, I started to refuse.

824
01:10:03,047 --> 01:10:04,878
Can you believe that?

825
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:07,999
American boy refusing to have a catch
with his father?

826
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:09,475
Why 14?

827
01:10:11,527 --> 01:10:13,916
That's when I read The Boat Rocker
by Terence Mann.

828
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:15,042
God!

829
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:17,005
I never played catch with him again.

830
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,362
That's the kind of crap
people always lay on me.

831
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:21,802
It's not my fault
you wouldn't play catch with him.

832
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:23,081
I know.

833
01:10:25,807 --> 01:10:27,843
Anyway, when I was 17...

834
01:10:28,927 --> 01:10:32,317
...l packed my things,
said something awful, and left.

835
01:10:32,927 --> 01:10:36,397
After a while, I wanted to come home,
but I didn't know how.

836
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:40,006
Made it back for the funeral, though.

837
01:10:49,887 --> 01:10:52,276
What was the awful thing you said?

838
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:55,285
To your father?

839
01:10:58,647 --> 01:11:02,435
I said I could never respect a man
whose hero was a criminal.

840
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:05,399
Who was his hero?

841
01:11:06,207 --> 01:11:08,038
Shoeless Joe Jackson.

842
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:14,286
You knew he wasn't a criminal.
Then why did you say it?

843
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:17,646
I was 17.

844
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:25,043
The son of a bitch died
before I could take it back.

845
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,078
Before I could tell him...

846
01:11:29,447 --> 01:11:30,846
...you know.

847
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:35,118
He never met my wife.

848
01:11:36,847 --> 01:11:38,803
He never saw his granddaughter.

849
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:42,404
This is your penance.

850
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,602
I know. I can't bring my father back.

851
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:49,764
So the least you can do
is bring back his hero.

852
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,001
Well...

853
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:57,924
Now I know
what everybody's purpose here is.

854
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:00,406
Except mine.

855
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:33,964
-Daddy!
-Karin, come here.

856
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:38,236
Hi!

857
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:43,520
-We missed you. Are you okay?
-Yeah. This is Terence Mann.

858
01:12:43,767 --> 01:12:44,836
Terry.

859
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,321
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

860
01:12:46,407 --> 01:12:47,317
Hi, Terry.

861
01:12:48,047 --> 01:12:50,800
And this young fellow is....
This is Archie Graham.

862
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:54,763
-Archie.
-He's come to practice with the team.

863
01:12:54,967 --> 01:12:58,039
Yeah? He's going to be able to do
a lot more than that.

864
01:12:58,327 --> 01:12:59,316
What does that mean?

865
01:13:11,007 --> 01:13:13,521
-Welcome back.
-Thanks, Joe.

866
01:13:13,607 --> 01:13:15,279
-Oh, my God.
-What?

867
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:17,558
That's Shoeless Joe Jackson!

868
01:13:17,767 --> 01:13:20,600
Of course it is.
You mean you didn't believe me?

869
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:24,236
I thought I did, but.... Oh, my God.

870
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:27,238
-Hi, Annie.
-Hi, Joe.

871
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:32,202
Good to see you. Terry,
I'd like you to meet Shoeless Joe Jackson.

872
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:34,438
Joe, Terry Mann.

873
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,638
-It's a pleasure meeting you.
-The pleasure's mine.

874
01:13:38,807 --> 01:13:42,004
I hope you don't mind,
but we got tired ofjust having practices...

875
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:45,921
...so we brought another team out
so we could have some real games.

876
01:13:46,007 --> 01:13:48,805
I don't mind. Where'd they come from?

877
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:50,725
Where did we come from?

878
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:53,162
You wouldn't believe
how many guys wanted to play.

879
01:13:53,247 --> 01:13:54,919
We had to beat 'em off with a stick.

880
01:13:55,047 --> 01:13:58,562
That's "Smokey" Joe Wood, and Mel Ott...

881
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:01,480
...and Gil Hodges!

882
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:03,046
Ty Cobb wanted to play.

883
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:05,800
We couldn't stand the son of a bitch
when we were alive...

884
01:14:05,887 --> 01:14:07,639
...so we told him to stick it!

885
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:14,926
-Are you Graham?
-Yes, sir.

886
01:14:15,527 --> 01:14:19,315
What are you doing on the sidelines?
You came to play ball, didn't you?

887
01:14:19,407 --> 01:14:20,806
Yes, sir.

888
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:25,161
-All right. Well, go warm up.
-Yes, sir.

889
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:28,720
Rookies.

890
01:14:29,487 --> 01:14:31,000
Unbelievable.

891
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:34,359
It's more than that.

892
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:36,680
It's perfect.

893
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:50,281
Safe!

894
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:01,438
Go, Graham! Go, kid!

895
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:03,165
Come on, Archie!

896
01:15:03,247 --> 01:15:05,477
He looks like a baby next to those guys.

897
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:06,602
He is.

898
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:18,395
Let's go.

899
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:22,921
Watch it, boy!

900
01:15:25,607 --> 01:15:28,121
Don't let him shake you up. Hang in there!

901
01:15:28,287 --> 01:15:31,245
Knuckles, what did you throw
at the kid for?

902
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:34,446
-He winked at me.
-Don't wink, kid.

903
01:15:36,647 --> 01:15:39,639
Good thing for you
he didn't throw the fastball.

904
01:15:43,727 --> 01:15:45,080
Let's see that fastball.

905
01:15:49,647 --> 01:15:50,636
Ball.

906
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:54,003
Hey! Come on. Give us a break!

907
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:55,436
Hey, ump.

908
01:15:56,647 --> 01:16:00,606
-How about a warning?
-Sure. Watch out you don't get killed.

909
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:02,636
Time!

910
01:16:03,487 --> 01:16:04,636
Time!

911
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:10,805
Those first two were high and tight.
So what do you think the next one will be?

912
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:15,525
Either low and away or in my ear.

913
01:16:15,647 --> 01:16:19,117
He's not going to want to load the bases.
So look for low and away.

914
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:20,765
Right.

915
01:16:21,487 --> 01:16:23,717
But watch out for in your ear.

916
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:26,480
-Come on, Archie!
-Let's go, kid!

917
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:28,319
Batter, batter, batter!

918
01:16:28,407 --> 01:16:31,080
Come on, Arch. It just takes one.

919
01:16:42,607 --> 01:16:44,802
-Yeah.
-That's deep enough.

920
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:48,400
Go! Go! Go home!

921
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,003
-Safe!
-Son of a....

922
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:55,365
Way to go, Arch! Way to go!

923
01:16:55,447 --> 01:16:57,403
Attaboy, Arch!

924
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:00,324
This is the wave!

925
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:03,403
-Way to go, man!
-Yeah, Archie.

926
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,962
-All right.
-Archie, we need it.

927
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,477
-Way to go.
-Yeah. Way to go.

928
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:44,920
-What is this?
-What is this jerk doing?

929
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:46,042
Hi!

930
01:17:46,807 --> 01:17:49,082
-Shit! Wreck him.
-Let me at him!

931
01:17:49,607 --> 01:17:51,404
You're interrupting the game, Mark.

932
01:17:53,087 --> 01:17:57,478
It's time to put away your little fantasies
and come down to Earth.

933
01:17:57,687 --> 01:18:01,157
-It's not a fantasy. They're real.
-Who is real?

934
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:04,320
Shoeless Joe Jackson, the White Sox,
all of them.

935
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:07,560
-You mean?
-No. He can't see any of them.

936
01:18:09,007 --> 01:18:10,599
Who is this, Elvis?

937
01:18:11,727 --> 01:18:12,796
Ray.

938
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:16,003
As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.

939
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,319
How do you do? I'm the Easter Bunny.

940
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:21,479
-Let's settle this thing now.
-Look. I'm not selling.

941
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:25,685
You have no money.
You have a stack of bills!

942
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,076
Come fall, you got no crop to sell.

943
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:31,284
But, I have a deal
that allows you to stay on the land.

944
01:18:31,487 --> 01:18:34,399
Daddy? We don't have to sell the farm.

945
01:18:34,727 --> 01:18:38,766
-You'll live in the house rent-free.
-What about the team--

946
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,883
Do you realize how much
this land is worth?

947
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,798
Yeah. Yeah.

948
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:46,164
$ 2,200 an acre.

949
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:50,281
We can't keep a useless baseball diamond
in rich farmland.

950
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,403
Read my lips. We're staying, all right?

951
01:18:52,487 --> 01:18:55,001
-We're staying.
-Ray, you're bankrupt!

952
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:58,204
I'm offering you a way to keep your home
because I love my sister.

953
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:02,280
My partners don't care
and are ready to foreclose right now.

954
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:05,325
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.

955
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,523
-Karin, please!
-Just wait! Wait!

956
01:19:11,567 --> 01:19:13,205
People will come.

957
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:17,798
-What people, sweetheart?
-From all over.

958
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:20,685
They'll just decide to take a vacation, see?

959
01:19:20,767 --> 01:19:24,840
And they'll come to lowa City.
They'll think it's really boring.

960
01:19:25,207 --> 01:19:28,802
So they'll want to pay us.
Like buying a ticket.

961
01:19:32,407 --> 01:19:35,080
You're not seriously listening to this,
are you?

962
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,761
-Yes.
-Wait a minute.

963
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,201
Why would anybody
pay money to come here?

964
01:19:41,487 --> 01:19:43,000
To watch the games.

965
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:47,565
It will be just like when they were kids,
a long time ago.

966
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:50,600
They'll watch the game
and remember what it was like.

967
01:19:51,127 --> 01:19:54,915
-What the hell is she talking about?
-People will come.

968
01:19:55,007 --> 01:19:57,237
All right. This is fascinating...

969
01:19:57,807 --> 01:20:00,958
...but you don't have the money
to bring the mortgage up to date.

970
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,356
So, you're still going to have to sell.

971
01:20:04,447 --> 01:20:07,120
I'm sorry, Ray. We got no choice.

972
01:20:10,687 --> 01:20:14,043
People will come, Ray.

973
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:19,878
They'll come to lowa
for reasons they can't even fathom.

974
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:24,845
They'll turn up your driveway,
not knowing for sure why they're doing it.

975
01:20:24,927 --> 01:20:28,317
They'll arrive at your door
as innocent as children...

976
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,363
...longing for the past.

977
01:20:30,527 --> 01:20:34,076
"Of course, we won't mind
if you look around," you'll say.

978
01:20:35,047 --> 01:20:37,117
"It's only $ 20 per person."

979
01:20:37,527 --> 01:20:40,485
They'll pass over the money
without even thinking about it.

980
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:43,798
For it is money they have
and peace they like.

981
01:20:43,887 --> 01:20:46,162
Ray! Just sign the papers.

982
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:49,286
Then they'll walk off to the bleachers...

983
01:20:50,327 --> 01:20:53,922
...and sit in their shirtsleeves
on a perfect afternoon.

984
01:20:56,087 --> 01:21:01,207
They'll find they have reserved seats
somewhere along one of the baselines...

985
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:06,839
...where they sat when they were children
and cheered their heroes...

986
01:21:07,287 --> 01:21:09,323
...and they'll watch the game...

987
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:13,116
...and it will be as if they dipped
themselves in magic waters.

988
01:21:13,487 --> 01:21:15,682
The memories will be so thick...

989
01:21:15,807 --> 01:21:18,321
...they'll have to brush them away
from their faces.

990
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:22,562
When the bank opens in the morning,
they'll foreclose.

991
01:21:23,007 --> 01:21:24,645
People will come, Ray.

992
01:21:24,887 --> 01:21:28,641
You're broke, Ray.
You sell now, or you lose everything.

993
01:21:29,287 --> 01:21:33,360
The one constant through all the years,
Ray, has been baseball.

994
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:37,404
America has rolled by
like an army of steamrollers.

995
01:21:37,887 --> 01:21:41,562
It's been erased like a blackboard,
rebuilt, and erased again.

996
01:21:43,287 --> 01:21:46,006
But baseball has marked the time.

997
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:50,235
This field, this game.

998
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:53,282
It's a part of our past, Ray.

999
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:57,004
It reminds us of all that once was good...

1000
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,238
...and it could be again.

1001
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:05,124
People will come, Ray.

1002
01:22:06,007 --> 01:22:08,077
People will most definitely come.

1003
01:22:09,127 --> 01:22:11,925
Ray, you will lose everything.

1004
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:14,603
You will be evicted.

1005
01:22:25,047 --> 01:22:26,480
Come on, Ray.

1006
01:22:46,607 --> 01:22:47,676
I'm not signing.

1007
01:22:48,327 --> 01:22:50,363
You're crazy! Absolutely nuts!

1008
01:22:51,087 --> 01:22:52,805
I can't do it, pal.

1009
01:22:54,327 --> 01:22:57,205
Ray, you build a baseball field
in the middle of nowhere...

1010
01:22:57,287 --> 01:22:59,039
...and you stare at nothing.

1011
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:00,162
It's not nothing.

1012
01:23:00,247 --> 01:23:03,956
-Your daughter's turned into a space case.
-Get your hands off her!

1013
01:23:05,767 --> 01:23:06,916
Karin?

1014
01:23:11,647 --> 01:23:13,319
-Is she all right?
-I don't know.

1015
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:15,841
-Is she breathing?
-Should I get the car?

1016
01:23:20,847 --> 01:23:22,803
I'm going to call emergency.

1017
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:26,482
-Annie, wait.
-What?

1018
01:23:43,767 --> 01:23:45,041
Just wait.

1019
01:24:02,727 --> 01:24:05,241
-What have we got here?
-She fell.

1020
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:15,720
-This child's choking to death.
-Get her up.

1021
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:17,759
Hold her steady now.

1022
01:24:23,687 --> 01:24:25,757
Hot dog. Stuck in her throat.

1023
01:24:26,807 --> 01:24:28,399
She'll be all right.

1024
01:24:28,487 --> 01:24:31,638
She'll be turning handsprings
before you know it.

1025
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:36,640
Thank you, Doc.

1026
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:40,767
No, son. Thank you.

1027
01:24:44,047 --> 01:24:46,083
Oh, my God. You can't go back.

1028
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:48,005
-You can't go back.
-It's all right.

1029
01:24:48,087 --> 01:24:50,078
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

1030
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:56,643
I best be getting on home...

1031
01:24:57,127 --> 01:25:00,358
...before Alicia begins to think
I got a girlfriend.

1032
01:25:05,247 --> 01:25:06,521
Hey, Doc.

1033
01:25:07,127 --> 01:25:08,640
Good work, Doc.

1034
01:25:10,487 --> 01:25:12,000
Nice going, Doc.

1035
01:25:15,007 --> 01:25:16,326
Going to miss you.

1036
01:25:18,767 --> 01:25:21,361
Win one for me one day, will you, boys?

1037
01:25:21,447 --> 01:25:23,039
-Okay, Doc.
-Yeah.

1038
01:25:30,607 --> 01:25:33,121
When did these ballplayers get here?

1039
01:25:38,407 --> 01:25:39,806
Hey, rookie!

1040
01:25:51,087 --> 01:25:52,566
You were good.

1041
01:26:06,047 --> 01:26:09,722
Do not sell this farm, Ray.
You got to keep this farm.

1042
01:26:10,047 --> 01:26:12,163
You've had a rough day.

1043
01:26:12,247 --> 01:26:15,284
-Go inside and get something cold to drink.
-Yeah.

1044
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:16,880
That's a good idea.

1045
01:26:18,127 --> 01:26:19,924
Don't sell the farm, Ray.

1046
01:26:28,687 --> 01:26:29,756
Ray?

1047
01:26:30,807 --> 01:26:32,718
We're going to call it a day.

1048
01:26:33,047 --> 01:26:35,322
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

1049
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:41,445
Do you want to come with us?

1050
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,156
-You mean it?
-No, not you.

1051
01:26:49,807 --> 01:26:50,842
Him.

1052
01:26:54,287 --> 01:26:56,118
-Him?
-Come with you?

1053
01:26:56,327 --> 01:26:57,999
-Out there.
-What is out there?

1054
01:26:58,687 --> 01:26:59,802
Come and find out.

1055
01:26:59,967 --> 01:27:02,435
Wait a second. Why him? I built this field.

1056
01:27:02,527 --> 01:27:06,315
-You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me.
-I'm unattached. You have a family.

1057
01:27:06,407 --> 01:27:07,965
I want to know what's out there.

1058
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:10,561
-I want to see it.
-But you're not invited.

1059
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:16,199
"Not invited"?
What do you mean I'm not invited?

1060
01:27:16,287 --> 01:27:19,006
That's my corn out there.
You guys are guests in my corn.

1061
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:23,600
I've done everything I've been asked to do.
I didn't understand, but I've done it.

1062
01:27:23,687 --> 01:27:25,803
I haven't once asked what's in it for me.

1063
01:27:25,887 --> 01:27:29,516
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying, "What's in it for me?"

1064
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:33,120
Is that why you did this? For you?

1065
01:27:38,567 --> 01:27:41,081
I think you'd better stay here, Ray.

1066
01:27:44,167 --> 01:27:45,156
Why?

1067
01:27:47,007 --> 01:27:49,805
Ray. There's a reason they chose me...

1068
01:27:49,887 --> 01:27:52,560
...just as there's a reason
they chose you and this field.

1069
01:27:53,927 --> 01:27:55,280
I gave an interview.

1070
01:27:55,487 --> 01:27:57,478
What are you talking about?

1071
01:27:57,567 --> 01:28:01,685
The one about Ebbets Field,
the one that sent you to Boston to find me.

1072
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:08,003
-You lied to me.
-You were kidnapping me at the time.

1073
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:10,760
-You lied to me!
-You said your finger was a gun.

1074
01:28:13,327 --> 01:28:15,363
-That's a good point.
-Ray.

1075
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:22,957
Listen to me, Ray. Listen to me.

1076
01:28:24,767 --> 01:28:26,917
There is something out there...

1077
01:28:27,447 --> 01:28:30,245
...and if I have the courage
to go through with this...

1078
01:28:30,327 --> 01:28:32,363
...what a story it'll make.

1079
01:28:34,087 --> 01:28:37,045
"Shoeless Joe Jackson comes to lowa."

1080
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:48,956
-Are you going to write about it?
-You bet I'll write about it.

1081
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:52,996
-You're going to write about it.
-That's what I do.

1082
01:28:57,287 --> 01:28:58,402
Good.

1083
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:02,842
Good.

1084
01:29:17,847 --> 01:29:19,838
Honey, where's he going?

1085
01:29:20,367 --> 01:29:23,040
Terry's been invited
to go out with the other players.

1086
01:29:23,127 --> 01:29:25,880
-How are you feeling, sweetheart?
-Stupid.

1087
01:29:26,047 --> 01:29:27,321
You mean "out"?

1088
01:29:27,567 --> 01:29:28,682
Yeah.

1089
01:29:29,647 --> 01:29:30,716
Out.

1090
01:29:31,327 --> 01:29:32,555
Far out.

1091
01:29:34,647 --> 01:29:36,239
I want a full description.

1092
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:39,203
Take care of this family.

1093
01:29:41,527 --> 01:29:42,960
Be careful.

1094
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:40,636
'Bye.

1095
01:30:43,727 --> 01:30:44,842
What?

1096
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:53,717
What are you grinning at, you ghost?

1097
01:30:54,607 --> 01:30:56,563
"If you build it...

1098
01:30:58,447 --> 01:30:59,880
"...he will come."

1099
01:31:11,647 --> 01:31:14,764
-Oh, my God.
-What? What is it?

1100
01:31:18,727 --> 01:31:19,921
It's my father.

1101
01:31:25,327 --> 01:31:26,919
"Ease his pain."

1102
01:31:28,247 --> 01:31:30,158
"Go the distance."

1103
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:34,200
It was you.

1104
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:40,805
No, Ray. It was you.

1105
01:32:06,407 --> 01:32:07,760
My God.

1106
01:32:09,007 --> 01:32:12,443
I only saw him years later
when he was worn down by life.

1107
01:32:14,407 --> 01:32:15,442
Look at him.

1108
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:21,963
He's got his whole life in front of him,
and I'm not even a glint in his eye.

1109
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:28,404
What do I say to him?

1110
01:32:30,087 --> 01:32:33,124
Why don't you introduce him
to his granddaughter?

1111
01:32:36,167 --> 01:32:37,156
Hi.

1112
01:32:38,407 --> 01:32:39,396
Hi.

1113
01:32:39,967 --> 01:32:43,084
I just wanted to thank you folks
for putting up this field...

1114
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:44,998
...letting us play here.

1115
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:47,085
I'm John Kinsella.

1116
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:50,481
I'm Ray.

1117
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:53,446
My wife Annie.

1118
01:32:54,487 --> 01:32:57,638
This is my daughter Karin.
Karin, this is my....

1119
01:33:00,887 --> 01:33:02,320
This is John.

1120
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,442
Hi, John.

1121
01:33:06,807 --> 01:33:08,240
Hi, Karin.

1122
01:33:10,767 --> 01:33:13,520
Well, we're going to let you two talk.

1123
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:18,885
If all these people are going to come,
we got a lot of work to do.

1124
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:23,082
It was very nice meeting you.

1125
01:33:24,047 --> 01:33:25,082
Ma'am.

1126
01:33:26,407 --> 01:33:27,840
Come on.

1127
01:33:42,087 --> 01:33:43,964
You catch a good game.

1128
01:33:45,047 --> 01:33:46,321
Thank you.

1129
01:33:48,567 --> 01:33:50,319
It's so beautiful here.

1130
01:33:52,487 --> 01:33:53,602
For me....

1131
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:58,645
For me, it's like a dream come true.

1132
01:34:02,007 --> 01:34:03,918
Can I ask you something?

1133
01:34:07,527 --> 01:34:09,563
Is this heaven?

1134
01:34:13,647 --> 01:34:14,921
It's lowa.

1135
01:34:16,887 --> 01:34:19,355
-Iowa?
-Yeah.

1136
01:34:23,047 --> 01:34:25,356
I could have sworn it was heaven.

1137
01:34:33,287 --> 01:34:36,484
Is there a heaven?

1138
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:39,841
Oh, yeah.

1139
01:34:42,007 --> 01:34:44,396
It's the place where dreams come true.

1140
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:05,238
Maybe this is heaven.

1141
01:35:11,567 --> 01:35:13,046
Good night, Ray.

1142
01:35:15,807 --> 01:35:17,240
Good night, John.

1143
01:35:27,087 --> 01:35:28,725
Hey! Dad?

1144
01:35:32,527 --> 01:35:34,438
You want to have a catch?

1145
01:35:37,007 --> 01:35:38,440
I'd like that.

1146
01:37:17,247 --> 01:37:19,238
