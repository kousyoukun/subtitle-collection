1
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,273
<i>My father's name was John Kinsella.</i>
<i>It's an Irish name.</i>

2
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,035
<i>He was born in North Dakota in 1896...</i>

3
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,633
<i>...and never saw a big city...</i>

4
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,871
<i>...until he came back from France in 1918.</i>

5
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>He settled in Chicago, where he learned</i>
<i>to live and die with the White Sox.</i>

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,513
<i>Died a little</i>
<i>when they lost the 1919 World Series...</i>

7
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,833
<i>...died a lot the following summer</i>
<i>when eight teammates...</i>

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,115
<i>...were accused of throwing that Series.</i>

9
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,551
<i>He played some in the minors,</i>
<i>but nothing came of it.</i>

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,957
<i>Moved to Brooklyn in '35...</i>

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,196
<i>...married Mom in '38...</i>

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,714
<i>...was already an old man</i>
<i>at the naval yards...</i>

13
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,836
<i>...when I was born in 1952.</i>

14
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,557
<i>My name's Ray Kinsella.</i>

15
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,192
<i>Mom died when I was 3,</i>
<i>and I suppose Dad did the best he could.</i>

16
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,389
<i>Instead of Mother Goose, I was put to bed</i>
<i>to stories of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...</i>

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,948
<i>...and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson.</i>

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,115
<i>Dad was a Yankees fan then,</i>
<i>so I rooted for Brooklyn.</i>

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,751
<i>But in '58, the Dodgers moved away,</i>
<i>so we had to find other reasons to fight.</i>

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,955
<i>We did.</i>

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,076
<i>When it came time to go to college...</i>

22
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,469
<i>...I picked the farthest</i>
<i>from home I could find.</i>

23
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,634
<i>This drove him up the wall,</i>
<i>which, I suppose, was the point.</i>

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,073
<i>Officially my major was English,</i>
<i>but really it was the '60s.</i>

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,829
<i>I marched, I smoked some grass...</i>

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,356
<i>...I tried to like sitar music,</i>
<i>and I met Annie.</i>

27
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,436
<i>The only thing we had in common</i>
<i>was that she came from Iowa...</i>

28
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,317
<i>...and I'd once heard of Iowa.</i>

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,430
<i>After graduation,</i>
<i>we moved to the Midwest...</i>

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,114
<i>...and stayed with her family</i>
<i>as long as we could.</i>

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,077
<i>Almost a full afternoon.</i>

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,679
<i>Annie and I got married in June of '74.</i>

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,797
<i>Dad died that fall.</i>

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,630
<i>A few years later, Karin was born.</i>

35
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,836
<i>She smelled weird,</i>
<i>but we loved her anyway.</i>

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,234
<i>Then Annie got the crazy idea</i>
<i>that she could talk me into buying a farm.</i>

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,750
<i>I'm 36 years old, I love my family,</i>
<i>I love baseball...</i>

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,354
<i>...and I'm about to become a farmer.</i>

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,070
<i>But until I heard the voice...</i>

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,711
<i>...I'd never done a crazy thing</i>
<i>in my whole life.</i>

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,711
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

42
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,111
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

43
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,913
Hey, Annie!

44
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,039
- Annie, what was that?
- What was what?

45
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,509
That voice just now. What was it?

46
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,517
We didn't hear anything.

47
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,548
All right.

48
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,871
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

49
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,112
- Okay, you must have heard that!
- Sorry.

50
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,596
Hey, come on in to dinner.

51
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,559
Let's go, pumpkin.

52
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,635
Is there a sound truck on the highway?

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,518
Nope. Hey, Karin, dinner's ready!

54
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,789
- Kids with a radio?
- Nope.

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,115
- Are you really hearing voices?
- Just one.

56
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,913
What did it say?

57
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,390
"If you build it, he will come."

58
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,995
- If you build what, who will come?
- He didn't say.

59
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,511
- I hate it when that happens.
- Me, too.

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,631
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

61
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,758
Build what? What is this?

62
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,998
It's okay, honey.

63
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,308
I'm just talking to the corn field.

64
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,750
<i>Anyway, I was walking</i>
<i>down along the street...</i>

65
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,070
<i>...and I heard this voice saying...</i>

66
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,798
<i>..."Good evening, Mr. Dowd."</i>

67
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,235
<i>Well, I turned around...</i>

68
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,755
<i>...and here was this big six-foot rabbit</i>
<i>leaning up against the lamppost.</i>

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,073
- Why did you do that? It was funny.
- Trust me. It's not funny.

70
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,589
The man is sick. Very sick.

71
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,910
Honey, get your book bag. Let's go!

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,754
I'll take her today.
I've got some errands to do in town.

73
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,355
Far-out.

74
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,392
- What if the voice calls while you're gone?
- Take a message.

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,076
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

76
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,435
'Bye.

77
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,028
In all those years, did you ever...

78
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,751
It's just I've heard
that sometimes farmers in the field...

79
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,274
They hear things. You know, voices.

80
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,319
- You hearing voices?
- No. It's just I heard some farmers do.

81
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,678
I, of course, don't, so I was wondering
if I was doing something wrong.

82
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,234
Did you ever hear voices out there?

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,710
- Who's hearing voices?
- Ray is. Out in the fields.

84
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,153
No, I'm not.

85
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,829
I'm...

86
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,233
Noises.

87
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,516
That darned tractor...

88
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,795
I'm just going to get some 3-in-1oil.
That ought to do it.

89
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,073
Nice talking to you.

90
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,399
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

91
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,712
All right, that's it! Who the...

92
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,634
Who are you? What do you want from me?

93
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,795
Son of a bitch.

94
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,111
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

95
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,512
If you build it...

96
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,273
If you build it...

97
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,468
...he will come.

98
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,193
You don't suppose
this is like an acid flashback?

99
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,509
I never took acid.

100
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,751
Maybe you will someday.
It's like a flash-forward.

101
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,073
Annie, there's more.

102
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,754
Honey, why don't you eat a little bit?

103
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,792
I think I know what
"If you build it, he will come" means.

104
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,474
Why do I not think
this is such a good thing?

105
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,199
I think it means
that if I build a baseball field out there...

106
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,789
...Shoeless Joe Jackson
will come back and play ball again.

107
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,873
You're kidding?

108
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,389
You're kidding.

109
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,595
Boy, I thought my family was crazy...

110
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,989
...but this is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

111
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,513
I know it's totally nuts.

112
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,309
- I mean, Shoeless Joe!
- He's dead. Died in '51. He's dead.

113
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,960
- They suspended him, right?
- Right.

114
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,551
- He's still dead?
- As far as I know.

115
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,156
Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing?

116
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,276
If I did, I've forgotten it.

117
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,718
He was supposed to be
so graceful and agile.

118
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,999
I'd actually like to see him play again...

119
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,231
...to let him play, to right an old wrong.

120
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
Wait. Wait a minute.

121
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,352
- Are you actually thinking of doing this?
- No.

122
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,189
I can't think of one good reason
why I should, but...

123
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,795
I'm 36. I have a wife,
a child, and a mortgage...

124
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,678
...and I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.

125
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,917
What does he have to do with all this?

126
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,360
I never forgave him for getting old.

127
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,878
By the time he was as old as I am now...

128
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,038
...he was ancient.

129
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,189
He must have had dreams,
but he never did anything about them.

130
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,477
For all I know,
he may have even heard voices, too...

131
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,314
...but he sure didn't listen to them.

132
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,433
The man never did one spontaneous thing
in all the years I knew him.

133
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,792
I'm afraid of that happening to me...

134
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,999
...and something tells me
this may be my last chance...

135
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,991
...to do something about it.

136
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,156
I want to build that field.

137
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,918
Do you think I'm crazy?

138
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,075
Yes.

139
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,637
But I also think
if you really feel you should do this...

140
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,150
...then you should do it.

141
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,594
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's plowing under his corn.

142
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,035
Why?

143
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,435
Ty Cobb called him
the greatest left fielder of all time.

144
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,553
He said his glove
was the place where triples go to die.

145
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,951
- Could he hit?
- Could he hit?

146
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,759
Lifetime average .356,
third highest in history.

147
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,752
Why'd they call him "Shoeless Joe"?

148
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,033
When he was in the minors...

149
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,839
...he bought a new pair of spikes
and hurt his feet.

150
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,549
<i>In the 6th inning, he took them off</i>
<i>and played in his socks.</i>

151
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,918
<i>The players kidded him, called him</i>
<i>"Shoeless Joe" and the name stuck.</i>

152
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,398
He's going to lose his farm.

153
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,629
Damned fool.

154
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,871
<i>Then in 1919,</i>
<i>his team the Chicago White Sox...</i>

155
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,996
<i>...threw the World Series.</i>

156
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,595
- <i>What's "threw"?</i>
- <i>It means they lost it on purpose.</i>

157
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,671
<i>Gamblers paid them to.</i>

158
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,910
<i>Except Shoeless Joe.</i>

159
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,670
<i>He did take their money,</i>
<i>but nobody ever proved he did one thing...</i>

160
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,318
<i>...to lose those games.</i>

161
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,673
If he threw it, how do you explain
that he hit .375 for the Series...

162
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,512
...and committed no errors?

163
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,589
I can't.

164
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,148
Twelve hits including
the Series' only home run...

165
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,470
...and they said he's trying to lose?

166
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,675
It's ridiculous.

167
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,158
<i>The commissioner of baseball</i>
<i>suspended eight of the players...</i>

168
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,152
<i>...including the great Shoeless Joe</i>
<i>Jackson, for life.</i>

169
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,832
<i>What's "suspend"?</i>

170
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,912
<i>It means they never</i>
<i>let him play the game again.</i>

171
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,636
My father said he saw him years later...

172
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,872
...playing under a made-up name
in some 10th-rate league in Carolina.

173
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,357
He'd put on 50 pounds,
and his spring was gone from his step...

174
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,271
...but he could still hit.

175
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,396
Dad used to say
nobody could hit like Shoeless Joe.

176
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,473
I think that's the first time
I've ever seen you smile...

177
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,869
...when you mentioned your father.

178
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,317
I have just created something
totally illogical.

179
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,910
That's what I like about it.

180
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,032
Am I completely nuts?

181
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,318
Not completely.

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,989
It's a good baseball field, Ray.

183
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,115
It's kind of pretty, isn't it?

184
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,354
Any sign?

185
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,679
Something's going to happen out there.

186
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,793
I can feel it.

187
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,229
<i>So, for the veteran southpaw,</i>
<i>his summer of woes continues.</i>

188
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,271
<i>That's four straight hits in the inning.</i>

189
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,999
Daddy, what's a "southpaw"?

190
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,710
It means a left-handed pitcher, honey.

191
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,034
- So how bad is it?
- Well.

192
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,519
Considering how much less acreage
we have for corn, I say we'll probably...

193
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,711
...almost break even.

194
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,399
We used up all our savings on that field.

195
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,474
- Daddy?
- Just a minute, Karin.

196
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,878
So what are you saying?
We can't keep the field?

197
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,120
Makes it real hard to keep the farm.

198
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,750
- Daddy.
- In a minute, Karin!

199
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,956
There's a man out there on your lawn.

200
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,196
I'll put up some coffee.
Why don't you go on outside?

201
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,509
Sorry.

202
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,116
I'll get some out there.

203
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,635
Hi.

204
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,748
Ray Kinsella.

205
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,393
Joe Jackson.

206
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,198
I bet it's good to be playing again.

207
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,069
Getting thrown out of baseball...

208
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,233
...was like having part of me amputated.

209
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,275
I've heard that old men wake up...

210
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,319
...and scratch itchy legs
that have been dust for over 50 years.

211
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,553
That was me.

212
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,996
I'd wake up at night...

213
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,037
...with the smell
of the ballpark in my nose...

214
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,752
...with the cool of the grass on my feet...

215
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,956
...the thrill of the grass.

216
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,793
Can you pitch?

217
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,795
Yeah.

218
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,589
Not bad.

219
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,390
- Don't we need a catcher?
- Not if you get it near the plate.

220
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,435
Right.

221
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,949
I'm pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.

222
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,669
Nice hit.

223
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,912
See if you can hit my curve.

224
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,439
- You can hit the curve ball.
- Put one right here.

225
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,635
Right.

226
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,951
Right, you're a low-ball hitter.

227
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,710
Man, I did love this game.

228
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,270
I'd have played for food money.

229
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,149
It was the game, the sounds, the smells.

230
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,552
Did you ever hold a ball
or a glove to your face?

231
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,549
Yeah.

232
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,868
I used to love traveling on the trains
from town to town.

233
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,473
The hotels, brass spittoons in the lobbies...

234
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,835
...brass beds in the rooms.

235
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,678
It was the crowd...

236
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,397
...rising to their feet
when the ball was hit deep.

237
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,234
I'd play for nothing.

238
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,233
It's my family.

239
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,478
What's with the lights?

240
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,755
All the stadiums have them now.

241
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,355
- Even Wrigley Field.
- It's harder to see the ball.

242
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,950
The owners found that more people
can attend night games.

243
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,709
Owners.

244
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,158
Mr. Jackson, this is my wife Annie
and my daughter Karin.

245
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,029
Ma'am.

246
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,552
Are you a ghost?

247
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,514
- She's kidding.
- That's okay.

248
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,435
- What do you think?
- You look real to me.

249
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,518
Then I guess I'm real.

250
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,436
Would you like to come inside?

251
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,475
Thanks. I don't think I can.

252
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,719
Can I come back again?

253
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,435
Yeah. I built this for you.

254
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,236
There are others, you know.

255
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,997
There were eight of us.
It would really mean a lot to them.

256
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,991
Yeah. Anytime. They're all welcome here.

257
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,039
Is this heaven?

258
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,475
No.

259
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,509
It's Iowa.

260
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,477
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

261
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,358
We're keeping this field.

262
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,632
You bet your ass we are.

263
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,436
- You're going to lose your farm, pal.
- How can you lose something so big?

264
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,996
- He misplaced the house once.
- Yeah, but it turned up two days later.

265
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,630
Come on. Ray?

266
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,991
This stupid baseball field will bankrupt you.
Everybody knows it.

267
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,438
If you default on your loan,
you'll lose everything.

268
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,273
If you sell now,
my partners will give you a fair price.

269
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,996
- Thanks, Mark, but no.
- No.

270
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,829
What are you holding onto this place for?

271
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,992
- You never liked Iowa.
- That's not true.

272
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,470
You never liked farming. It is true.
You don't know about farming.

273
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,393
I know a lot about farming.
More than you think.

274
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,597
Well, then how could you plow
under your major crop?

275
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,915
What's a crop?

276
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,197
- Come on. That is funny.
- "What's a crop?"

277
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,635
- Daddy, the baseball game is on.
- Excuse us.

278
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,149
Excuse us.

279
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,597
Annie, I don't believe this guy.

280
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,558
I'm trying to bail him out,
and he leaves to watch television.

281
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,351
- He used to be so normal.
- Yeah.

282
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,196
Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!

283
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,513
All right!

284
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,549
Watch Joe's feet.

285
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,149
A good left fielder
knows what pitch is coming.

286
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,149
He can tell from the bat's angle
which way the ball's heading.

287
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,358
- Show off!
- Stick it in your ear, Gandil.

288
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,349
If you'd have run like that against Detroit,
I'd have won 20 games that year!

289
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,549
For Pete's sakes, Cicotte,
that was 68 years ago. Give it up!

290
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,758
Hey! You guys want to play ball or what?

291
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,671
- Muscle-bound jerk.
- Oh, yeah? At least I got muscles.

292
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,958
- At most, you got muscles.
- Come on, asshole! Pitch!

293
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,390
Weaver, be nice.

294
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,551
- Sorry, kid!
- It's okay. I don't mind.

295
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,913
- All right, Karin.
- Hey, hey, hey!

296
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,151
Mom and everybody are leaving now.

297
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,951
Oh, well, it was...
You know. Thanks for coming.

298
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,829
Think about what I said.
I'm just trying to help.

299
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,269
I know.

300
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,557
Thought you were watching some game.

301
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,034
It's not really a game.
It's more like practice.

302
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,479
There are only eight of them.
They can't play a real game.

303
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,555
- Eight of what?
- Them.

304
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,872
- Who "them"?
- Them them.

305
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,275
- You don't see them?
- Karin, honey, what are you watching?

306
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,992
- The baseball men.
- Baseball men?

307
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,556
- Do you see the baseball men right now?
- Of course, I do.

308
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,879
You really don't see them?

309
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,112
I don't think it's very polite
to try to make other people feel stupid.

310
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,150
Mom, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

311
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,273
Dee, wait. You don't see these people?

312
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,032
It's not funny, Annie.

313
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,073
They couldn't see it.

314
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,351
This is really interesting.

315
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,633
Hey, Ray, look at this.

316
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,190
68 years since I wore this uniform,
still fits me like a glove.

317
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,476
You must keep in pretty good shape.

318
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,391
Now let's see, I died in '70.

319
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,996
That means I haven't had
a cigarette in 18 years.

320
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,590
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No.

321
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,190
Karin! Ray! Dinner!

322
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,390
"Ray, dinner."

323
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,550
- All right.
- Come on. Let's hit the showers.

324
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,513
See you later.

325
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,952
See you, guys.

326
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,078
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"

327
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,472
Come on, you knucklehead.

328
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,230
That is so cool.

329
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,472
- <i>Ease his pain.</i>
- What?

330
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,512
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't understand. What?

331
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,111
<i>Ease his pain.</i>

332
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,754
"Ease his pain."
What the hell does that mean?

333
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,354
"Ease his pain"? What pain?

334
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,156
All right. Whose pain?

335
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,554
Thanks a lot.

336
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,593
Thanks a lot.

337
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,871
Come on, honey, wash up.
We got the PTA meeting after dinner.

338
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,837
They're talking about banning books again.

339
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,596
Really subversive books like
<i>The Wizard of Oz, The Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

340
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,280
- What happened to you?
- The voice is back.

341
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,195
Oh, Lord! You don't have to build
a football field now, do you?

342
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,111
He said, "Ease his pain."

343
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,715
- Ease whose pain?
- I asked him. He wouldn't tell me.

344
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,349
- Shoeless Joe's?
- I don't think so.

345
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,914
- One of the other players?
- I don't think so.

346
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,437
This is a very nonspecific voice out there,
and he's starting to piss me off.

347
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,718
I was having a fun day today. A good day.

348
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,514
Want a fry?

349
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,152
And I say smut and filth like this
has no place in our schools.

350
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,438
Fascist. I'd like to ease her pain.

351
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,028
Mrs. Kessinik, that book
you're waving about is hardly smut.

352
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,832
It's considered by many critics
to be the classic novel about the 1960s.

353
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,033
- It's pornography!
- No. The Supreme Court says it's not.

354
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,152
- And it's author, Mr. Mann...
- Is sick!

355
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,669
Terence Mann is a Pulitzer Prize winner.

356
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,110
He's widely regarded
as the finest satirist of his time.

357
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,556
Yeah, well, I think he's a pervert!
Probably a communist, too!

358
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,790
What planet are these people from?

359
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,270
The so-called novels of Terence Mann...

360
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,432
...endorse promiscuity, godlessness...

361
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,877
...the mongrelization of the races,
and disrespect to high-ranking officers...

362
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,911
...of the United States Army.

363
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,555
And that's why
right-thinking school boards...

364
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,077
...all across the country
have been banning this man's s-h-i-t...

365
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,476
...since 1969.

366
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,113
Terence Mann?

367
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,233
You know why he stopped writing books?
Because he masturbates.

368
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,028
Excuse me, madam.

369
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,755
Excuse me.

370
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,356
Terence Mann was a warm
and gentle voice of reason...

371
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,998
...during a time of great madness.

372
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,678
He coined the phrase,
"Make love, not war."

373
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,553
While other people chanted, "Burn,
baby, burn," he was talking about love...

374
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,517
...and peace and understanding.

375
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,118
I cherished every one of his books,
and I dearly wish he had written more.

376
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,919
Maybe if you had experienced
even a little bit of the '60s...

377
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,672
...you might feel the same way, too.

378
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,393
I experienced the '60s.

379
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,710
No, you had two '50s
and moved right into the '70s.

380
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,919
Annie, look at this.

381
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,150
Your husband plowed under his corn
and built a baseball field.

382
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,390
- Now, there's an intelligent response.
- The weirdo.

383
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,353
- Annie.
- Honey, it's all right. I'll be cool.

384
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,876
At least he is not a book-burner,
you Nazi cow.

385
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,469
At least I'm not married to the biggest
horse's ass in three counties.

386
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,275
All right, Beulah,
do you want to step outside?

387
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,354
Fine!

388
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,910
All right, I've got a better idea.
Let's take a vote. Who's for Eva Braun?

389
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,072
Who wants to burn books?

390
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,437
Who wants to spit on the Constitution of
the United States of America? Anybody?

391
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,831
All right.
Now, who's for the Bill of Rights?

392
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,236
Who thinks freedom
is a pretty darn good thing?

393
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,998
Come on! Let's see those hands!

394
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,839
Who thinks we have to stand up...

395
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,549
...to the kind of censorship
they had under Stalin?

396
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,392
All right. There you go.
America, I love you. I'm proud of you.

397
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,717
- We got to go.
- We got to go.

398
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,074
This is great!

399
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,991
I figured it out.

400
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,919
Was that great, or what?

401
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,389
- I figured it out.
- It's just like the '60s again!

402
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,755
- I figured it out.
- Step outside, you Nazi cow.

403
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,834
- I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease.
- What?

404
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,918
I just halted the spread
of neofascism in America...

405
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,831
- Terence Mann.
- What about him?

406
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,229
- That's whose pain.
- How do you know that?

407
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,349
I just know.

408
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,630
I was right about building the field,
wasn't I?

409
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,551
- Yes. What's his pain?
- I don't know.

410
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,279
- How are you supposed to ease it?
- I don't know.

411
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,152
Look, he's my favorite writer, too...

412
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,312
...but what's Terence Mann
got to do with baseball?

413
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,514
It's incredible. By the early '70s,
the guy decides people have become...

414
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,989
...either too extremist
or too apathetic to listen.

415
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,837
So he stops writing books,
he starts writing poetry about whales...

416
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,117
...and then he starts fooling around
with a home computer.

417
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,031
Know what he does now?

418
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,549
He writes software
for interactive children's videos.

419
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,394
They teach kids
how to resolve their conflicts peacefully.

420
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,956
- God, what an amazing guy.
- What's that got to do with baseball?

421
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,749
In the April 1962 issue of <i>Jet</i> magazine...

422
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,116
...there's a story called
"This Is Not A Kite."

423
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,799
It's not his best work, but the story's hero
is named John Kinsella.

424
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,393
- My father.
- Wow.

425
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,509
What do you mean, "Wow"?

426
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,832
What should I say? Big wow!
What's it got to do with baseball?

427
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,069
You drive.

428
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,118
Okay, the last interview
he ever gave was in 1973.

429
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,953
- Guess what it's about.
- Some kind of team sport.

430
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,994
The guy was a baseball fanatic.
Listen to this:

431
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,550
"As a child, my earliest recurring dream
was to play at Ebbets Field...

432
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,870
"...with Jackie Robinson
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.

433
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,554
"Of course, it never happened.
The Dodgers left Brooklyn.

434
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,792
"They tore down Ebbets Field,
but even now, I still dream that dream."

435
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,309
That's sad.

436
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,553
The man wrote the best books
of his generation.

437
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,035
He was a pioneer in the civil rights
and the antiwar movement.

438
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,079
He made the cover of <i>Newsweek.</i>
He knew everybody. He did everything.

439
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,914
He helped shape his time.
The guy hung out with The Beatles.

440
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,834
It wasn't enough.
What he missed was baseball.

441
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,797
- Oh, my God!
- What?

442
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,519
As a small boy,
he had a bat named Rosebud.

443
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,512
- Give me that.
- Sorry.

444
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,629
The guy hasn't been
to a baseball game since 1958.

445
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,629
So, to ease his pain, you're supposed
to take him to a ball game.

446
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,709
Yes.

447
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,588
Ray, this is nuttier
than building the baseball field.

448
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,434
No, it's not. It's pretty weird,
but building the field was weirder.

449
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,999
Five, ten percent weirder.

450
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,640
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to nip this one in the bud.

451
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,871
We're having moderate to heavy
financial difficulties here.

452
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,111
You can't take off for Boston
while we're going broke in Iowa.

453
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,276
This is really new territory for us...

454
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,914
...but we're dealing
with primal forces of nature.

455
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,719
When primal forces of nature tell you
to do something...

456
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,872
...it's not prudent to quibble over details.
- Why do you have to go?

457
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,475
Why can't the voice send somebody else?
How about Shirley MacLaine?

458
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,354
Is she too busy?
What does this have to do with you?

459
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,396
That's what I have to find out.

460
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,755
We are behind on the mortgage.

461
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,877
That field ate up all of our savings.
We could lose this farm.

462
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,430
I won't even stay in motels.
I'll sleep in the car. I'll beg for food.

463
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,398
No. Now, this is too much.

464
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,833
I understand your need to prove
to yourself and to the world...

465
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,798
...you are not turning into your father,
but you have.

466
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,599
You believed in the magic.
It happened. Isn't that enough?

467
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,240
It's more than that.
I know this is totally nuts...

468
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,357
...but there's another reason
I'm supposed to do it.

469
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,479
I feel it as strongly as I've felt anything
in my life. There's a reason.

470
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,074
What? Just tell me what it is.

471
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,239
Something's going to happen at the game.
There's something at Fenway Park.

472
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,471
I got to be there
with Terence Mann to find it out.

473
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,354
Is Fenway the one
with the big green wall in left field?

474
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,428
Yeah.

475
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,752
I dreamt last night
you were at Fenway with Terence Mann.

476
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,230
- Was I sitting on the first base side?
- Yes.

477
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,557
About halfway up on the aisle?

478
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,074
- Yeah. Eating a hot dog.
- Eating a hot dog.

479
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,357
- I had the same dream.
- I'll help you pack.

480
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,879
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.

481
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,959
Hi. No.

482
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,392
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
It's a great pleasure to finally get to...

483
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,319
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella. I'm a big fan of yours.

484
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,630
Hi.

485
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,873
How do you do, Mr. Mann?
I have to take you to a base...

486
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,909
All right, stupid,
put your hands up and get in the trunk.

487
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,752
Good.

488
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,678
He lives right around here.
Do you know him?

489
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,551
He's sort of a tall black man.
I'm a friend of his.

490
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,357
If he was much of a friend,
he'd have given you the directions himself.

491
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,070
That's a good point. Thank you.

492
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,476
I don't know where he lives.
Get away from me.

493
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,997
I ain't going to tell you nothing.
Go away. You're a pest.

494
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,390
Two blocks down, right-hand side.

495
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,870
First door that doesn't have
a chicken in the window is his.

496
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,399
No chicken.

497
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,469
Who the hell are you?

498
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,833
Sir, my name's Ray Kinsella.

499
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,159
- We got a learning disability here?
- If I could just have one minute, please.

500
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,758
I can't tell you the secret of life,
and I don't have any answers for you.

501
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,390
I don't give interviews,
and I'm no longer a public figure.

502
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,433
I just want to be left alone, so piss off.

503
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,271
Wait! Wait!

504
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,036
I've come 1,500 miles to see you...

505
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,635
...at the risk of losing my home
and alienating my wife.

506
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,753
All I'm asking is one minute. Please.

507
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,915
One minute.

508
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,838
I understand your desire for privacy...

509
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,638
...and I wouldn't intrude
if this weren't extremely important.

510
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,635
Oh, God. I don't do causes anymore.

511
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,988
This isn't a cause.
I don't need money or an endorsement.

512
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,594
Refreshing.

513
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,956
You once wrote, "There comes a time...

514
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,873
"...when all the cosmic tumblers
have clicked into place...

515
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,758
"...and the universe
opens itself up for a few seconds...

516
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,592
"...to show you what's possible."

517
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,958
- Oh, my God!
- What?

518
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,238
- You're from the '60s.
- Well, yeah. Actually...

519
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,879
Out!

520
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,111
Back to the '60s!
There's no place for you here in the future.

521
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,838
Get back while you still can!

522
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,315
You've changed, you know that?

523
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,959
Yes, I suppose I have.
How about this? Peace, love, dope.

524
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,758
Now get the hell out of here!

525
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,311
- You've really pissed me off.
- Just hold it right there.

526
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,352
I didn't want to do it this way.

527
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,916
- What the hell is that?
- It's a gun, what do you think it is?

528
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,514
- It's your finger.
- No, it's a gun.

529
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,911
- Let me see it.
- I'm not going to show you my gun.

530
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,790
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just need you to come with me...

531
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,269
What are you doing?

532
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,228
I'll beat you with a crowbar
until you go away.

533
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,516
Wait! You can't do that.

534
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,156
There are rules here?
Oh, no. There are no rules here.

535
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,718
You're a pacifist!

536
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,714
Shit.

537
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,271
Thank you.

538
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,631
So, what? You're kidnapping me?
What's the deal here?

539
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,280
I was hoping I could just convince you
to come with me.

540
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,873
So you are kidnapping me?

541
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,074
I have to take you to a baseball game.

542
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,629
You what?

543
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,153
Tonight's game. Red Sox, A's.

544
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,715
Why?

545
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,273
Something will happen there.

546
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,432
I don't know what,
but we'll find out when it does.

547
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,069
My name's Ray Kinsella.

548
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,948
You used my father's name
for a character in one of your stories.

549
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,075
John Kinsella.

550
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,319
You're seeing a whole team
of psychiatrists, aren't you?

551
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,797
I don't blame you for thinking that,
but no, I'm not.

552
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,791
I swear to God,
I'm the least crazy person I've ever known.

553
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,318
Why are you kidnapping me
to a baseball game?

554
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,075
- May I?
- Oh, please. Want a cup of coffee?

555
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,509
No.

556
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,472
Want some cookies?

557
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,315
No.

558
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,431
I read an interview you gave...

559
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,398
...about how you always dreamed
of playing at Ebbets Field...

560
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,278
...and how sad you felt
when they tore it down.

561
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,549
I never said that.

562
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,829
You didn't?

563
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,355
I don't even recall thinking that.

564
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,109
Weird.

565
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,035
This whole thing is so weird.

566
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,996
Then why go through with it?

567
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,558
It's a long story.

568
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,629
But it's a really good story.
I'll tell you on the way.

569
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,549
- I'm not getting rid of you, am I?
- No.

570
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,872
If you come to this game with me,
I swear I'll never bother you again.

571
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,396
Not even a Christmas card.

572
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,991
So what do you do with yourself
these days?

573
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,197
I live, I work. I learned how to cook.

574
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,714
I take walks and watch sunsets.

575
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,871
Don't you miss being involved?

576
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,312
I was the East Coast distributor
of involved.

577
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,513
I ate it and drank it and breathed it.

578
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,359
Then they killed Martin, and Bobby...

579
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,355
...they elected Tricky Dick twice...

580
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,119
...and now people like you think
I must be miserable...

581
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,510
...because I'm not involved anymore.
I've got news for you.

582
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,909
I spent all my misery years ago.

583
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,954
I have no more pain left for any of you.
I gave at the office.

584
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,397
So what do you want?

585
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,274
I want them to stop
looking to me for answers...

586
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,511
...begging me to speak again,
write again, be a leader.

587
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,955
I want them to start thinking
for themselves.

588
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,871
And I want my privacy.

589
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,157
No, I meant what do you want?

590
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,312
Dog and a beer.

591
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,277
- Two.
- $7.

592
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,313
Okay, I understand you.

593
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,908
You should be entitled
to as much privacy as you want.

594
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,911
But why stop writing?

595
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,634
I haven't published a word in 17 years,
and still I have to endure lunatics like you.

596
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,190
What do you think would happen
if I suddenly came out with a new book?

597
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,078
They'd bleed me dry.

598
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,756
<i>Go the distance.</i>

599
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,790
<i>Go the distance.</i>

600
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,869
What's the matter?

601
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,359
- You didn't see that?
- See what?

602
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,510
I'm sorry.
I guess you didn't have to be here.

603
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,749
What?

604
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,268
Whenever you want to go, we can go.

605
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,392
Fine. Let's go.

606
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,354
What is it you're not telling me?

607
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,232
I've already taken up
too much of your time.

608
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,756
I wish I had your passion.

609
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,510
Misdirected though it might be,
it is still a passion.

610
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,637
I used to feel that way about things, but...

611
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,950
- You got another message, didn't you?
- You'll think I'm crazy.

612
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,958
I already think you're crazy.
What did it say?

613
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,477
It said, "The man's done enough.
Leave him alone."

614
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,678
Moonlight Graham.

615
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,314
- You saw it.
- Saw what?

616
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,516
You saw it. New York Giants, 1922.
He played one game. He never got to bat.

617
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,158
- You saw it!
- What did I see?

618
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,912
Chisholm, Minnesota.

619
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,470
We were the only ones who saw it.
Did you hear the voice, too?

620
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,754
It's all right to admit it.

621
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,274
It's what told me to find you.
Did you hear it?

622
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,993
"Go the distance"?

623
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,193
- Yes. Do you know what it means?
- Yes.

624
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,315
What?

625
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,631
It means we're going to Minnesota
to find Moonlight Graham.

626
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,678
- We're going... We?
- I must be out of my mind.

627
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,112
- What do we do when we find him?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

628
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,471
That's right. You're right.

629
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,430
- This is so bitchin'.
- I don't believe I'm doing this.

630
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,672
<i>Hey, Annie, guess what?</i>
<i>I'm with Terence Mann.</i>

631
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,716
<i>Oh, my God. You kidnapped him.</i>

632
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,149
<i>No, I didn't. He wanted to.</i>

633
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,512
<i>I'm really sorry,</i>
<i>but I'm going to be a few days longer.</i>

634
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,033
<i>We're going to Minnesota.</i>

635
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,793
<i>I don't believe this. What's in Minnesota?</i>

636
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,633
An old ballplayer.
I'll explain when I get home.

637
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,518
- How are things with you?
- <i>Fine.</i>

638
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,558
Great. Look, Ann, I got to go, okay?

639
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,550
Give Karin a hug for me, and I love you.

640
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,393
I love you, too.

641
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,790
Someday explain all this to me, okay?

642
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,110
<i>I'll try. Bye-bye.</i>

643
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,269
'Bye.

644
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,439
Why didn't you tell him?

645
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,516
You got no choice in the matter.

646
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,836
Half a dozen Grahams.
No Archibald. No Moonlight.

647
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,754
Follow me.

648
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,468
Hello.

649
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,632
Excuse me. Maybe you can help us.

650
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,553
We're looking for an ex-baseball player,
Archibald Graham.

651
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,550
- Oh, you mean Doc Graham.
- No, I think his nickname was "Moonlight."

652
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,480
- That's Dr. Graham.
- Dr. Graham?

653
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,833
His baseball career never amounted
to much, so he went back to school.

654
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,239
His father was a doctor.

655
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:32,236
- Do you know where we can find him?
- It's nothing bad. We're not from the IRS.

656
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,159
Doc Graham is dead. He died in 1972.

657
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,070
"At times children could not afford
eyeglasses or milk or clothing.

658
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,519
"Yet no child was ever denied
these essentials...

659
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,558
"...because, in the background,
there was always Dr. Graham.

660
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,753
"Without any fanfare or publicity,
the glasses or the milk...

661
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,638
"...or the ticket to the ball game
found their way into the child's pocket."

662
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,437
- You wrote that.
- The day he died.

663
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,873
Can I see that?

664
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,396
- You're a good writer.
- So are you.

665
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,398
Something's missing.

666
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,993
He sounds like he was a wonderful man.

667
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,277
Half the towns in North America
have a Doc Graham.

668
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,195
Why do we have to travel halfway
across the country to find this one...

669
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,750
...sixteen years after he died?

670
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,277
There's got to be more.

671
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,909
What else?

672
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,869
He always wore an overcoat...

673
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,555
...he had white hair,
and he always carried an umbrella.

674
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,995
What was the umbrella for?

675
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,477
I think it got to be a habit,
something to hang on to.

676
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,799
If you asked him, he said he used it
to beat away his lady admirers.

677
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,399
Tell me about his wife.

678
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,394
Alicia.

679
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,759
She moved to South Carolina
after Doc passed.

680
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,274
She passed a couple years later.

681
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,036
She always wore blue.

682
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,318
The shopkeepers in town
would stock blue hats...

683
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,271
...because they knew if Doc walked by,
he'd buy one.

684
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,754
When they cleaned out his office...

685
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,593
...they found boxes of blue hats...

686
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,073
...that he never got around to give her.

687
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,032
I'll bet you didn't know that.

688
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,155
No, I didn't.

689
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,436
No screwing, no drinking,
no opium, no midnight abortions.

690
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,115
No illegitimate children, no shady finances.

691
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,756
You sound disappointed.

692
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,156
Shoeless Joe had a problem.
That's why he needed you.

693
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,391
This guy doesn't need us.

694
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,270
Do you know you're missing?

695
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,873
Oh, God.

696
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:16,272
"His father, who lives in Baltimore,
notified police after receiving...

697
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,318
"...no answer to repeated telephone calls."
Shoot.

698
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,308
I better call him.

699
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,439
- You want me to...
- Thanks.

700
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,434
I'm taking a walk. Be back in a while.

701
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,831
What do I tell him?

702
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,349
"This year's"?

703
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,353
Dr. Graham?

704
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,999
Dr. Graham?

705
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,078
My name's Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa.

706
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,279
Are you Moonlight Graham?

707
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,551
No one's called me Moonlight Graham
in 50 years.

708
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,877
I've come a very long way to see you.

709
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,756
I couldn't sleep tonight.
Usually I sleep like a baby.

710
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,956
I told Alicia I was going to take a walk.

711
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,989
Do you mind if I join you?
I'd like to talk to you.

712
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,878
Let's walk over to my office.

713
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,677
What do you want to talk to me about?

714
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,674
When you got to the majors,
you played only one inning of one game.

715
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,716
What happened with you?

716
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,795
It was the last day of the season.

717
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,189
Bottom of the eighth inning,
we were way ahead.

718
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,353
I'd been up with the club for three weeks,
but I hadn't seen any action.

719
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,671
Suddenly old John McGraw
points a bony finger in my direction...

720
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,637
...and he says, "Right field."

721
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,314
I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring.

722
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,234
Grabbed my glove, and ran out on the field.

723
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,756
Did you get to make a play?

724
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,673
They never hit the ball out of the infield.

725
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,753
The game ended. The season was over.

726
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,589
I knew they'd send me back down.

727
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,277
I couldn't bear the thought
of another year in the minors.

728
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,318
So I decided to hang them up.

729
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,189
- Go on. Sit down.
- Thank you.

730
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,157
So what was that like?

731
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,352
It was like coming this close
to your dreams...

732
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,429
...and then watching them brush past you,
like a stranger in a crowd.

733
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,317
At the time, you don't think much of it.

734
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,790
We don't recognize our most significant
moments while they're happening.

735
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,636
Back then I thought,
"Well, there'll be other days."

736
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,633
I didn't realize that was the only day.

737
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,552
And now, I want to ask you a question.

738
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,758
What's so interesting about half an inning
that would make you come from Iowa...

739
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,593
...to talk to me about it
50 years after it happened.

740
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,679
I didn't really know till just now...

741
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,559
...but I think it's to ask you,
if you could do anything you wanted...

742
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,989
...if you could have a wish...

743
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,711
And you're the kind of man
who could grant me that wish?

744
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,554
I don't know. I'm just asking.

745
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,353
You know,
I never got to bat in the major leagues.

746
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,398
I'd have liked to have had that chance,
just once...

747
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,835
...to stare down a big-league pitcher.

748
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:53,072
Stare him down,
then just as he goes into his windup, wink.

749
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,955
Make him think you know
something he doesn't.

750
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,712
That's what I wish for.

751
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,588
The chance to squint at a sky so blue
that it hurts your eyes to look at it.

752
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,513
To feel the tingle in your arms
as you connect with the ball.

753
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,068
To run the bases,
stretch a double into a triple...

754
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,720
...and flop face first into third.

755
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,155
Wrap your arms around the bag.

756
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,839
That's my wish.

757
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,072
Is there enough magic out there
in the moonlight...

758
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,832
...to make this dream come true?

759
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:27,275
- What would you say if I said yes?
- I think I'd actually believe you.

760
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,110
There's a place
where things like that happen...

761
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,668
...and if you want to go, I can take you.

762
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,032
This is my most special place
in all the world.

763
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,592
Once a place touches you like this,
the wind never blows so cold again.

764
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,436
You feel for it. Like it was your child.

765
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,553
I can't leave Chisholm.

766
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,278
I understand. I do.

767
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,069
But I really think
you're supposed to come with us.

768
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,029
No.

769
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,429
But your wish?

770
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,677
It'll have to stay a wish.

771
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,879
I was born here, I lived here,
I'll die here, but no regrets.

772
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:23,272
Fifty years ago, for five minutes,
you came this close.

773
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,236
It would kill some men to get that close
to their dream and not touch it.

774
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,718
They'd consider it a tragedy.

775
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,709
Son, if I'd only gotten to be a doctor
for five minutes...

776
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,951
...now that would have been a tragedy.

777
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,759
I better be getting home.
Alicia will think I got a girlfriend.

778
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,313
And he smiled.

779
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,717
And then I figured, maybe we're not
supposed to take him with us.

780
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,433
I don't know.

781
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,993
I don't know why in the hell
we were supposed to come here.

782
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,755
Maybe it's to find out
if one inning can change the world.

783
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,313
- Think it did?
- It did for these people.

784
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,915
If he'd gotten a hit,
he might have stayed in baseball.

785
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,873
I don't know.

786
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,196
Your wife called before.
She wants you to call her tonight.

787
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,553
I'm fine. I'm just so glad it's you.

788
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,629
Listen, I talked to the bank...

789
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,110
...and I asked them
if we could miss a payment or two...

790
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:39,074
...and they told me that they had just sold
the note on the farm...

791
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,478
...to Mark and his partners.

792
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,352
Right. So they own the paper now.

793
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,274
He says if we don't sell to them,
they're going to foreclose.

794
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,350
We don't have the money.

795
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:58,868
Look, I've got to take Mr. Mann
back to Boston first.

796
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,032
- No.
- Wait a second.

797
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,199
I'm going to Iowa with you.

798
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,268
We're coming home.

799
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,549
Hell, I can't quit now.
I got to see this ball park.

800
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,754
Not everyone can see it. You might not.

801
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,278
Give it a try.

802
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,076
I need all the karma I can get right now.

803
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,631
- Thanks. You're the first car by.
- How far you going?

804
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,075
- How far you going?
- Iowa.

805
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,068
If it's okay, I'll just ride along a while.
I play baseball.

806
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,711
- Hop in.
- All right.

807
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,712
I'm looking for a place to play.

808
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,395
I heard that all through the Midwest,
they have towns with teams.

809
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,756
And in some places,
they'll even find you a day job...

810
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,195
...so you can play ball
nights and weekends.

811
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:13,552
This is your lucky day, kid.
We're going someplace kind of like that.

812
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,434
All right.

813
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,918
- I'm Ray Kinsella. This is Terence Mann.
- Hi.

814
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,752
I'm Archie Graham.

815
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,991
It's funny the way he described towns
finding you a job...

816
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:41,710
...so that you could play on their team.
They haven't done that for years.

817
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,435
My dad did that for a while,
but that was in the '20s.

818
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,313
What happened to your father?

819
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,592
He never made it as a ballplayer...

820
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,717
...so he tried to get his son
to make it for him.

821
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,791
By the time I was 10, playing baseball...

822
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,429
...got to be like eating vegetables
or taking out the garbage.

823
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,678
So when I was 14, I started to refuse.

824
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,591
Can you believe that?

825
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,712
American boy refusing to have a catch
with his father?

826
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,188
Why 14?

827
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,629
That's when I read <i>The Boat Rocker</i>
by Terence Mann.

828
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:14,755
God!

829
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,718
I never played catch with him again.

830
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,075
That's the kind of crap
people always lay on me.

831
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,515
It's not my fault
you wouldn't play catch with him.

832
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,794
I know.

833
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,556
Anyway, when I was 17...

834
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,030
...I packed my things,
said something awful, and left.

835
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,110
After a while, I wanted to come home,
but I didn't know how.

836
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,719
Made it back for the funeral, though.

837
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,989
What was the awful thing you said?

838
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,998
To your father?

839
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,148
I said I could never respect a man
whose hero was a criminal.

840
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,112
Who was his hero?

841
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,751
Shoeless Joe Jackson.

842
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,999
You knew he wasn't a criminal.
Then why did you say it?

843
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,359
I was 17.

844
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,756
The son of a bitch died
before I could take it back.

845
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,791
Before I could tell him...

846
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,559
...you know.

847
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,831
He never met my wife.

848
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,516
He never saw his granddaughter.

849
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,117
This is your penance.

850
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,315
I know. I can't bring my father back.

851
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,477
So the least you can do
is bring back his hero.

852
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,714
Well...

853
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,637
Now I know
what everybody's purpose here is.

854
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,119
Except mine.

855
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,677
- Daddy!
- Karin, come here.

856
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,949
Hi!

857
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:43,233
- We missed you. Are you okay?
- Yeah. This is Terence Mann.

858
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,549
Terry.

859
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,034
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

860
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,030
Hi, Terry.

861
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,513
And this young fellow is...
This is Archie Graham.

862
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,476
- Archie.
- He's come to practice with the team.

863
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,752
Yeah? He's going to be able to do
a lot more than that.

864
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,029
What does that mean?

865
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,234
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, Joe.

866
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,992
- Oh, my God.
- What?

867
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,271
That's Shoeless Joe Jackson!

868
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,313
Of course it is.
You mean you didn't believe me?

869
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,949
I thought I did, but... Oh, my God.

870
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,951
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi, Joe.

871
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:31,915
Good to see you. Terry,
I'd like you to meet Shoeless Joe Jackson.

872
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,151
Joe, Terry Mann.

873
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,351
- It's a pleasure meeting you.
- The pleasure's mine.

874
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,717
I hope you don't mind,
but we got tired of just having practices...

875
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,634
...so we brought another team out
so we could have some real games.

876
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,518
I don't mind. Where'd they come from?

877
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,438
Where did we come from?

878
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,875
You wouldn't believe
how many guys wanted to play.

879
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,632
We had to beat 'em off with a stick.

880
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,275
That's "Smokey" Joe Wood, and Mel Ott...

881
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,193
...and Gil Hodges!

882
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,759
Ty Cobb wanted to play.

883
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,513
We couldn't stand the son of a bitch
when we were alive...

884
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,352
...so we told him to stick it!

885
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,639
- Are you Graham?
- Yes, sir.

886
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:19,028
What are you doing on the sidelines?
You came to play ball, didn't you?

887
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,519
Yes, sir.

888
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,874
- All right. Well, go warm up.
- Yes, sir.

889
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,433
Rookies.

890
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,713
Unbelievable.

891
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,072
It's more than that.

892
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,393
It's perfect.

893
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,994
Safe!

894
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,151
Go, Graham! Go, kid!

895
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,878
Come on, Archie!

896
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,190
He looks like a baby next to those guys.

897
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,315
He is.

898
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,108
Let's go.

899
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,634
Watch it, boy!

900
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,834
Don't let him shake you up. Hang in there!

901
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,958
Knuckles, what did you throw
at the kid for?

902
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,159
- He winked at me.
- Don't wink, kid.

903
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,352
Good thing for you
he didn't throw the fastball.

904
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,793
Let's see that fastball.

905
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,349
Ball.

906
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,716
Hey! Come on. Give us a break!

907
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,149
Hey, ump.

908
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,319
- How about a warning?
- Sure. Watch out you don't get killed.

909
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,349
Time!

910
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,349
Time!

911
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,518
Those first two were high and tight.
So what do you think the next one will be?

912
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,238
Either low and away or in my ear.

913
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,830
He's not going to want to load the bases.
So look for low and away.

914
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,478
Right.

915
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,430
But watch out for in your ear.

916
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,193
- Come on, Archie!
- Let's go, kid!

917
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,032
Batter, batter, batter!

918
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,793
Come on, Arch. It just takes one.

919
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,515
- Yeah.
- That's deep enough.

920
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,113
Go! Go! Go home!

921
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,716
- Safe!
- Son of a...

922
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,078
Way to go, Arch! Way to go!

923
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,116
Attaboy, Arch!

924
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,037
This is the wave!

925
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,116
- Way to go, man!
- Yeah, Archie.

926
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,675
- All right.
- Archie, we need it.

927
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,190
- Way to go.
- Yeah. Way to go.

928
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,633
- What is this?
- What is this jerk doing?

929
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:45,755
Hi!

930
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,795
- Shit! Wreck him.
- Let me at him!

931
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,117
You're interrupting the game, Mark.

932
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,191
It's time to put away your little fantasies
and come down to Earth.

933
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,870
- It's not a fantasy. They're real.
- Who is real?

934
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,033
Shoeless Joe Jackson, the White Sox,
all of them.

935
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,273
- You mean?
- No. He can't see any of them.

936
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,312
Who is this, Elvis?

937
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,509
Ray.

938
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,716
As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.

939
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,032
How do you do? I'm the Easter Bunny.

940
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,192
- Let's settle this thing now.
- Look. I'm not selling.

941
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,398
You have no money.
You have a stack of bills!

942
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,789
Come fall, you got no crop to sell.

943
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,997
But, I have a deal
that allows you to stay on the land.

944
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,112
Daddy? We don't have to sell the farm.

945
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:38,479
- You'll live in the house rent-free.
- What about the team...

946
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,596
Do you realize how much
this land is worth?

947
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,511
Yeah. Yeah.

948
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,877
$2,200 an acre.

949
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,994
We can't keep a useless baseball diamond
in rich farmland.

950
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,116
Read my lips. We're staying, all right?

951
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,714
- We're staying.
- Ray, you're bankrupt!

952
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,917
I'm offering you a way to keep your home
because I love my sister.

953
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,993
My partners don't care
and are ready to foreclose right now.

954
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,038
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.

955
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,236
- Karin, please!
- Just wait! Wait!

956
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,918
People will come.

957
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,511
- What people, sweetheart?
- From all over.

958
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,398
They'll just decide to take a vacation, see?

959
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:24,553
And they'll come to Iowa City.
They'll think it's really boring.

960
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,515
So they'll want to pay us.
Like buying a ticket.

961
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,793
You're not seriously listening to this,
are you?

962
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,474
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.

963
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,914
Why would anybody
pay money to come here?

964
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,713
To watch the games.

965
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:47,278
It will be just like when they were kids,
a long time ago.

966
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,313
They'll watch the game
and remember what it was like.

967
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,628
- What the hell is she talking about?
- People will come.

968
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,950
All right. This is fascinating...

969
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,671
...but you don't have the money
to bring the mortgage up to date.

970
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,069
So, you're still going to have to sell.

971
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,833
I'm sorry, Ray. We got no choice.

972
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,756
People will come, Ray.

973
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,591
They'll come to Iowa
for reasons they can't even fathom.

974
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,558
They'll turn up your driveway,
not knowing for sure why they're doing it.

975
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,030
They'll arrive at your door
as innocent as children...

976
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,076
...longing for the past.

977
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,789
"Of course, we won't mind
if you look around," you'll say.

978
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,830
"It's only $20 per person."

979
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,198
They'll pass over the money
without even thinking about it.

980
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,511
For it is money they have
and peace they like.

981
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,875
Ray! Just sign the papers.

982
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,999
Then they'll walk off to the bleachers...

983
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,635
...and sit in their shirtsleeves
on a perfect afternoon.

984
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,920
They'll find they have reserved seats
somewhere along one of the baselines...

985
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:06,552
...where they sat when they were children
and cheered their heroes...

986
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,036
...and they'll watch the game...

987
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,829
...and it will be as if they dipped
themselves in magic waters.

988
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,395
The memories will be so thick...

989
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,034
...they'll have to brush them away
from their faces.

990
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,275
When the bank opens in the morning,
they'll foreclose.

991
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,358
People will come, Ray.

992
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,354
You're broke, Ray.
You sell now, or you lose everything.

993
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,073
The one constant through all the years,
Ray, has been baseball.

994
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,117
America has rolled by
like an army of steamrollers.

995
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,275
It's been erased like a blackboard,
rebuilt, and erased again.

996
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,719
But baseball has marked the time.

997
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,948
This field, this game.

998
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,995
It's a part of our past, Ray.

999
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,717
It reminds us of all that once was good...

1000
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,951
...and it could be again.

1001
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,837
People will come, Ray.

1002
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,790
People will most definitely come.

1003
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,638
Ray, you will lose everything.

1004
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,316
You will be evicted.

1005
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,193
<i>Come on, Ray.</i>

1006
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,389
I'm not signing.

1007
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,076
You're crazy! Absolutely nuts!

1008
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,518
I can't do it, pal.

1009
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,918
Ray, you build a baseball field
in the middle of nowhere...

1010
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,752
...and you stare at nothing.

1011
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,875
It's not nothing.

1012
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,669
- Your daughter's turned into a space case.
- Get your hands off her!

1013
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,629
Karin?

1014
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,032
- Is she all right?
- I don't know.

1015
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,554
- Is she breathing?
- Should I get the car?

1016
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,516
I'm going to call emergency.

1017
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,195
- Annie, wait.
- What?

1018
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,754
Just wait.

1019
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,954
- What have we got here?
- She fell.

1020
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,433
- This child's choking to death.
- Get her up.

1021
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,472
Hold her steady now.

1022
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,470
Hot dog. Stuck in her throat.

1023
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,112
She'll be all right.

1024
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,351
She'll be turning handsprings
before you know it.

1025
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,353
Thank you, Doc.

1026
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,480
No, son. Thank you.

1027
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,796
Oh, my God. You can't go back.

1028
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,718
- You can't go back.
- It's all right.

1029
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,791
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1030
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,356
I best be getting on home...

1031
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,071
...before Alicia begins to think
I got a girlfriend.

1032
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,234
Hey, Doc.

1033
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,353
Good work, Doc.

1034
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,713
Nice going, Doc.

1035
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,039
Going to miss you.

1036
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,074
Win one for me one day, will you, boys?

1037
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,752
- Okay, Doc.
- Yeah.

1038
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,834
When did these ballplayers get here?

1039
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,519
Hey, rookie!

1040
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,279
You were good.

1041
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,435
Do not sell this farm, Ray.
You got to keep this farm.

1042
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,876
You've had a rough day.

1043
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,997
- Go inside and get something cold to drink.
- Yeah.

1044
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,593
That's a good idea.

1045
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,637
Don't sell the farm, Ray.

1046
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,469
Ray?

1047
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,431
We're going to call it a day.

1048
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,035
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

1049
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,158
Do you want to come with us?

1050
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,869
- You mean it?
- No, not you.

1051
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,555
Him.

1052
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,831
- Him?
- Come with you?

1053
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,712
- Out there.
- What is out there?

1054
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,515
Come and find out.

1055
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,148
Wait a second. Why him? I built this field.

1056
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,028
- You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me.
- I'm unattached. You have a family.

1057
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,678
I want to know what's out there.

1058
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,274
- I want to see it.
- But you're not invited.

1059
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,912
"Not invited"?
What do you mean I'm not invited?

1060
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,719
That's my corn out there.
You guys are guests in my corn.

1061
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,313
I've done everything I've been asked to do.
I didn't understand, but I've done it.

1062
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,516
I haven't once asked what's in it for me.

1063
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,229
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, "What's in it for me?"

1064
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,833
Is that why you did this? For you?

1065
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,794
I think you'd better stay here, Ray.

1066
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:44,869
Why?

1067
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,518
Ray. There's a reason they chose me...

1068
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,273
...just as there's a reason
they chose you and this field.

1069
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,993
I gave an interview.

1070
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,191
What are you talking about?

1071
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,398
The one about Ebbets Field,
the one that sent you to Boston to find me.

1072
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,716
- You lied to me.
- You were kidnapping me at the time.

1073
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,473
- You lied to me!
- You said your finger was a gun.

1074
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,076
- That's a good point.
- Ray.

1075
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,670
Listen to me, Ray. Listen to me.

1076
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,630
There is something out there...

1077
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,958
...and if I have the courage
to go through with this...

1078
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,076
...what a story it'll make.

1079
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,758
"Shoeless Joe Jackson comes to Iowa."

1080
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,669
- Are you going to write about it?
- You bet I'll write about it.

1081
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,709
- You're going to write about it.
- That's what I do.

1082
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,115
Good.

1083
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,555
Good.

1084
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,551
Honey, where's he going?

1085
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,753
Terry's been invited
to go out with the other players.

1086
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,593
- How are you feeling, sweetheart?
- Stupid.

1087
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,034
You mean "out"?

1088
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,395
Yeah.

1089
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,429
Out.

1090
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,268
Far out.

1091
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,952
I want a full description.

1092
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,916
Take care of this family.

1093
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,673
Be careful.

1094
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,349
'Bye.

1095
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,555
What?

1096
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,430
What are you grinning at, you ghost?

1097
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,276
"If you build it...

1098
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,593
"...he will come."

1099
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,477
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

1100
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,634
It's my father.

1101
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,632
"Ease his pain."

1102
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,871
"Go the distance."

1103
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,913
It was you.

1104
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,518
No, Ray. It was you.

1105
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,473
My God.

1106
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:12,156
I only saw him years later
when he was worn down by life.

1107
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,155
Look at him.

1108
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,676
He's got his whole life in front of him,
and I'm not even a glint in his eye.

1109
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,117
What do I say to him?

1110
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,837
Why don't you introduce him
to his granddaughter?

1111
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:36,869
Hi.

1112
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,109
Hi.

1113
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,797
I just wanted to thank you folks
for putting up this field...

1114
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,711
...letting us play here.

1115
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,798
I'm John Kinsella.

1116
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,194
I'm Ray.

1117
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,159
My wife Annie.

1118
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:57,351
This is my daughter Karin.
Karin, this is my...

1119
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,033
This is John.

1120
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,155
Hi, John.

1121
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,953
Hi, Karin.

1122
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,233
Well, we're going to let you two talk.

1123
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:18,598
If all these people are going to come,
we got a lot of work to do.

1124
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,795
It was very nice meeting you.

1125
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,795
Ma'am.

1126
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,553
Come on.

1127
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,677
You catch a good game.

1128
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,034
Thank you.

1129
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,032
It's so beautiful here.

1130
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,315
For me...

1131
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,358
For me, it's like a dream come true.

1132
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,631
Can I ask you something?

1133
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,276
Is this heaven?

1134
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,634
It's Iowa.

1135
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,068
- Iowa?
- Yeah.

1136
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,069
I could have sworn it was heaven.

1137
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,197
Is there a heaven?

1138
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,554
Oh, yeah.

1139
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,109
It's the place where dreams come true.

1140
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,951
Maybe this is heaven.

1141
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,759
Good night, Ray.

1142
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,953
Good night, John.

1143
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,438
Hey! Dad?

1144
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,151
You want to have a catch?

1145
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,153
I'd like that.

1146
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,951
