1
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,598
My father's name
was John Kinsella.

2
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,100
It's an Irish name.

3
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,602
He was born
in North Dakota in 1896

4
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,105
and never saw
a big city

5
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,472
until he came back
from France in 1918.

6
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,478
Settling in Chicago,
he learned to live and die

7
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,979
with the White Sox.

8
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,643
Died a little when they
lost the 1919 World Series,

9
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,619
died a lot
when eight White Sox

10
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,248
were accused of throwing
that Series.

11
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,383
He played some
in the minors,

12
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,017
but nothing
came of it.

13
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,221
Moved to Brooklyn
in '35,

14
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,787
married Mom in '38,

15
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,198
was already an old man
at the naval yards

16
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,702
when I was born
in 1952.

17
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,237
My name's Ray Kinsella.

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,739
Mom died when I was 3,

19
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,073
and I suppose Dad did
the best he could.

20
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,407
Instead of Mother Goose,

21
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,312
I was put to bed
to stories of Babe Ruth,

22
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,747
Lou Gehrig,

23
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,411
and the great
Shoeless Joe Jackson.

24
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,920
Dad was a Yankees fan then,

25
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,581
so I rooted for Brooklyn.

26
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,091
In '58,
the Dodgers moved away,

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,628
so we had to find
other reasons to fight.

28
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,662
We did.

29
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,630
When I chose a college,

30
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,496
I picked the farthest
from home I could find.

31
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,968
This drove him
up the wall,

32
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,597
which, I suppose,
was the point.

33
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,607
Officially my major
was English,

34
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,109
but really
it was the sixties.

35
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,612
I marched,
I smoked some grass,

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,114
I tried to like
sitar music,

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,048
and I met Annie.

38
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,382
The only thing
we had in common

39
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,717
was that
she came from lowa,

40
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,053
and I'd once
heard of lowa.

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,559
After graduation,
we moved to the Midwest

42
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,926
and stayed with her family
as long as we could...

43
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,464
almost a full afternoon.

44
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,729
Annie and I got married
in June of '74.

45
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,565
Dad died that fall.

46
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,662
A few years later,

47
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,172
Karin was born.

48
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,074
She smelled weird,
but we loved her anyway.

49
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,578
Then Annie got
the crazy idea

50
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,080
she could talk me into
buying a farm.

51
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,084
I'm 36 years old,
I love my family,

52
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,585
I love baseball,

53
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,588
and I'm about to become
a farmer.

54
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,590
But until
I heard the voice,

55
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,092
I'd never done
a crazy thing

56
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,152
in my whole life.

57
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,628
If you build it,
he will come.

58
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,988
If you build it,
he will come.

59
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,601
Hey, Annie!

60
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,364
Annie, what was that?

61
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,802
What was what?

62
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,208
That voice just now.
What was it?

63
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,111
We didn't hear anything.

64
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,276
All right.

65
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:27,119
If you build it,
he will come.

66
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,096
O-OK, you must have
heard that!

67
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,725
Sorry.

68
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,566
Hey, come on in
to dinner.

69
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,503
Let's go, pumpkin.

70
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,419
Is there, like, a sound truck
on the highway?

71
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,427
Nope.

72
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,021
Hey, Karin,
dinner's ready!

73
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,691
Kids with a radio?

74
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,893
Nope.

75
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,370
Hey, are you
really hearing voices?

76
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,427
Just one.

77
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,097
What did it say?

78
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,943
"If you build it,
he will come."

79
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,884
If you build what,
who will come?

80
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,385
He didn't say.

81
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,887
I hate it
when that happens.

82
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,116
Me, too.

83
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:49,130
If you build it,
he will come.

84
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,851
Build what?

85
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,016
What is this?

86
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,026
Ray?

87
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,530
It's OK, honey. L...

88
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,090
I'm just talking
to the cornfield.

89
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,531
Anyway, I was walking
down along the street,

90
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,042
and l... I heard
this voice saying,

91
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,976
"Good evening,
Mr. Dowd."

92
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,537
Well, l... I turned around,

93
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,550
and here was
this big 6' rabbit

94
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,449
leaning up against
the lamppost.

95
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,759
Why did you do that?
It was funny.

96
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,057
Trust me, Karin.
It's not funny.

97
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,562
The man is sick.

98
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,562
Very sick.

99
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,565
Karin, honey,
get your book bag.

100
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,565
Let's go!

101
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,397
Hon, I'll
take her today.

102
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,563
I've got errands
to do in town.

103
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,798
Far out.

104
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,566
Hey.

105
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,579
What if the voice calls
while you're gone?

106
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,239
Take a message.

107
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,510
Ha. Bye.

108
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,846
Bye.

109
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,249
Bye.

110
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,684
In all those years,

111
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,189
did you ever...

112
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,691
It's just I've heard

113
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,852
that sometimes farmers
in the field...

114
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,362
They hear things.
You know, voices.

115
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,864
You hearing voices?

116
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,696
No. It's just I heard
some farmers do.

117
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,030
I, of course, don't,

118
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,536
so I was wondering

119
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,096
if I was doing
something wrong.

120
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,903
Did you... Did you
ever hear voices out there?

121
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,104
Who's hearing voices?

122
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,703
Ray is.

123
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,872
Out in the fields.

124
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,313
No, I'm not.

125
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,941
I'm...

126
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,715

That darned tractor...

129
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,389
I'm just going to
get some 3-in-1 oil.

130
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,554
That ought to do it.

131
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,063
It was nice...

132
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,621
Nice talking to you.

If you build it,
he will come.

00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,297
All right, that's it!

137
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,297
Huh?

Who are you, huh?

If you build it...

If you build it...

145
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,987
he will come.

146
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,690
You don't suppose

147
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,990
this is like
an acid flashback, do you?

148
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,087
I never took acid.

149
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,597
Maybe you will someday.

150
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,100
It's like
a flash-forward.

151
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,601
Annie, there's more.

152
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,071
Honey, why don't you
eat a little bit?

L...

154
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,607
I think I know

155
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,474
what " If you build it,
he will come" means.

156
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,173
Why do I not think
this is so good?

157
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,681
I think it means

158
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,947
that if I build
a baseball field out there,

159
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,784
Shoeless Joe Jackson
will get to come back

160
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,949
and play ball again.

Uh-uh.

Yeah.

Ha! You're kidding.

Boy, I thought
my family was crazy,

167
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,410
but this is
the craziest thing ever.

168
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,410
I know.

169
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,912
I mean,
Shoeless Joe!

170
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,744
He's dead.
Died in '51.

171
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,748
He's dead.

172
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,250
They suspended him, right?

173
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,410
Right.

174
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,919
He's still dead?

175
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,979
As far as I know.

176
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,652
Did you know Babe Ruth
copied his swing?

177
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,155
If I did,
I've forgotten it.

178
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,429
He was supposed to be
so graceful and agile.

179
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,103
I'd actually like
to see him play again,

180
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,612
to let him play...

181
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,614
to right an old wrong.

182
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,614
Wait.

183
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,344
Wait a minute,
Bosco.

184
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,556
Are you actually
thinking of doing this?

185
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,989
No.

186
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,894
I mean, I can't think of one
good reason why I should, but...

187
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,569
I'm 36.
I have a wife,

188
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,403
a child,
and a mortgage,

189
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,211
and I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.

190
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,405
And I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.

191
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:28,911
What's your father

192
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,414
got to do
with all of this?

193
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:34,474
I never forgave him
for getting old.

194
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:40,249
By the time he was
as old as I am now,

195
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,156
he was ancient.

196
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:47,427
I mean, he must
have had dreams,

197
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,433
but he never did
anything about them.

198
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:54,369
For all I know, he may have even
heard voices, too,

199
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,340
but he sure didn't
listen to them.

200
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,343
The man never did one
spontaneous thing

201
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:03,437
in all the years
I knew him.

202
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:07,541
Annie, I'm afraid
of that happening to me,

203
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,052
and something tells me

204
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,384
this may be
my last chance

205
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,447
to do something
about it.

206
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:18,618
I want to
build that field.

207
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:22,899
Do you think I'm crazy?

208
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:25,527
Yes.

209
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:30,574
But I also think

210
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:34,134
if you really
feel you should do this...

211
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,308
then you should do it.

212
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:55,088
What the hell is he doing?

213
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,100
He's plowing under his corn.

214
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:58,362
Why?

215
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,541
Ty Cobb called him

216
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,044
the greatest left fielder
of all time.

217
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:09,545
He said his glove

218
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:12,674
was the place where
triples go to die.

219
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,149
Could he hit?

220
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:15,651
Could he hit?

221
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,052
Lifetime average.356...
third highest in history.

222
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,556
Why'd they call him
Shoeless Joe?

223
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,718
When he was
in the minors,

224
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,558
a new pair of spikes
hurt his feet.

225
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,894
In the 6th inning,
he took them off

226
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,728
and played
in his socks.

227
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,063
The players kidded him,

228
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,070
called him "Shoeless Joe,"
and the name stuck.

229
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,072
He's going to
lose his farm.

230
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,869
Damned fool.

231
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,570
Then in 1919, his team
the Chicago White Sox,

232
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:43,546
they threw
the World Series.

233
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:44,581
What's threw?

234
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,742
It means they lost
on purpose.

235
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,581
Gamblers paid them to.

236
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,245
Except Shoeless Joe.

237
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,255
He did take their money,

238
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:55,258
but nobody ever proved
he did one thing

239
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:56,987
to lose those games.

240
00:14:58,329 --> 00:14:59,762
If he threw it,

241
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:03,096
how do you explain he
hit.375 for the Series

242
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,361
and committed no errors?

243
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:05,459
I can't.

244
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:08,027
12 hits including
the Series' only home run,

245
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,700
and they said
he's trying to lose?

246
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:11,935
It's ridiculous.

247
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,442
The commissioner of baseball

248
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:15,445
suspended eight
of the players,

249
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,947
including the great
Shoeless Joe Jackson,

250
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,947
for life.

251
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:20,677
What's suspend?

252
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:24,620
It means they never
let him play the game again.

253
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,621
My father said
he saw him years later

254
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,559
playing under
a made-up name

255
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:34,063
in some 10th-rate league
in Carolina.

256
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,066
He'd put on 50 pounds,

257
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,068
and his spring was gone,

258
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,070
but he could still hit.

259
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:44,734
Dad used to say
nobody could hit like Shoeless Joe.

260
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,902
I think that's
the first time

261
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,741
I've ever
seen you smile

262
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,804
when you mentioned
your father.

263
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:55,641
Well...

264
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:07,762
I have just created something
totally illogical.

265
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,927
That's what
I like about it.

266
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:17,938
Am I completely nuts?

267
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:20,709
Hmm?

268
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:21,938
Not completely.

269
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,881
It's a good
baseball field, Ray.

270
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,544
It's kind of pretty,
isn't it?

271
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:29,950
Mm-hmm.

272
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:53,474
Any sign?

273
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:59,583
Something's going to
happen out there.

274
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,140
I can feel it.

275
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,868
So, for the veteran southpaw,

276
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,703
his summer of woes
continues.

277
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:27,039
That's four straight hits
in the inning.

278
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:30,706
Daddy, what's a southpaw?

279
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:34,808
Um, it means
a left-handed pitcher, hon.

280
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,555
So how bad is it?

281
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:39,555
Well,

282
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,558
considering how much
less acreage

283
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,059
we have for corn,

284
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:45,925
I say we'll probably...

285
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:48,124
almost break even.

286
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,570
We used up
all our savings

287
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:55,901
on that field, Ray.

288
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:56,905
Daddy?

289
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,635
Just a minute, Karin.

290
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,508
So what are you saying?

291
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,413
We can't keep the field?

292
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,745
Makes it real hard
to keep the farm.

293
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:17,025
Daddy.

294
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:18,686
In a minute, Karin!

295
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:23,222
There's a man out there
on your lawn.

296
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,514
I'll put up some coffee.

297
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:14,073
Why don't you
go on outside?

298
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:12,393
Sorry.

299
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:18,106
I'll get some out there.

300
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:49,937
Hi.

301
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,604
Ray Kinsella.

302
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,639
Joe Jackson.

303
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,533
I bet it's good
to be playing again, huh?

304
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:37,920
Getting thrown
out of baseball...

305
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:41,389
was like having
part of me amputated.

306
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,393
I've heard that
old men wake up

307
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:49,455
and scratch itchy legs
that have been dust for over 50 years.

308
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,457
That was me.

309
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,002
I'd wake up at night...

310
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:59,975
with the smell
of the ball park in my nose,

311
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:06,209
with the cool
of the grass on my feet...

312
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:08,274
the thrill
of the grass.

313
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:17,683
Can you pitch?

314
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:20,756
Yeah...

315
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:23,927
not bad.

316
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:41,150
Don't we need
a catcher?

317
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,743
Not if you get it
near the plate.

318
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:46,448
Right.

319
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:01,560
I'm pitching
to Shoeless Joe Jackson.

320
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,041
Nice hit.

321
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:29,165
See if you
can hit my curve.

322
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:41,267
You can hit
the curve ball.

323
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:43,312
Put one right here, huh?

324
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:46,442
Right.

325
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:02,464
Right... you're
a low ball hitter.

326
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:04,998
Man, I did
love this game.

327
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:09,194
I'd have played
for food money.

328
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:12,207
It was the game...

329
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:14,903
the sounds,
the smells.

330
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:21,973
Did you ever hold a ball
or a glove to your face?

331
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:23,883
Yeah.

332
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:29,824
I used to love traveling on the trains
from town to town.

333
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:34,091
The hotels...
brass spittoons in the lobbies,

334
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:36,155
brass beds
in the rooms.

335
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,505
It was the crowd...

336
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:45,006
rising to their feet

337
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:47,566
when the ball
was hit deep.

338
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:52,881
Shoot...

339
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:57,047
I'd play for nothing.

340
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,883
[Screen Door Closes]

341
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,084
It's my family.

342
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,228
What's with the lights?

343
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:14,930
Oh, all the stadiums
have them now.

344
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:16,438
Even Wrigley Field.

345
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:18,940
It's harder
to see the ball.

346
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,945
The owners found that more people
can attend night games.

347
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:24,241
Owners.

348
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:40,229
Mr. Jackson,
this is my wife Annie

349
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,730
and my daughter Karin.

350
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:43,390
Ma'am.

351
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:44,592
Hi.

352
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,637
Are you a ghost?

353
00:26:47,704 --> 00:26:49,729
Karin.

354
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:50,898
She's kidding.

355
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,339
That's OK.

356
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:54,933
What do you think?

357
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:57,946
You look real to me.

358
00:26:58,014 --> 00:27:00,039
Then I guess I'm real.

359
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:03,108
Would you like
to come inside?

360
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:06,121
Uh, thanks.
I don't think I can.

361
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,689
Can I come back again?

362
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:21,430
Yeah. I built this for you.

363
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:27,741
There are others, you know.

364
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,745
There were eight of us.

365
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:32,748
It would really mean
a lot to them.

366
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:35,376
Yeah... anytime.

367
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:37,420
They're all welcome here.

368
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:50,629
Hey, is this heaven?

369
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:52,795
No.

370
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:56,233
It's lowa.

371
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,476
Where's he going?

372
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:06,742
I don't know.

373
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:20,687
We're keeping this field.

374
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:25,201
You bet your ass we are.

375
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,598
You're going
to lose your farm, pal.

376
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,605
How can you lose
something so big?

377
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:32,607
He misplaced
the house once.

378
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:34,609
Yeah, but it turned up.

379
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:36,907
Ray, come on.
Ray? Ray?

380
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:38,412
This stupid baseball field's

381
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,913
going to bankrupt you.

382
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,416
If you default
on your loan,

383
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:43,917
you're going
to lose everything.

384
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:47,080
My partners
will give you a fair price.

385
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:49,488
Thanks, Mark.
Thanks, Mark, but no.

386
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:50,957
No.

387
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:53,961
What are you holding
onto this place for?

388
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:55,462
You never liked lowa.

389
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:56,964
That's not true.

390
00:28:57,032 --> 00:28:59,967
You don't know
the first thing about farming.

391
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:02,469
I know a lot
about farming.

392
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:03,971
More than you think.

393
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:07,907
Well, then how could you
plow under your major crop?

394
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:09,604
What's a crop?

395
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:13,276
Come on.
That is funny.

396
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:14,782
What's a crop?

397
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,751
Daddy, the baseball game
is on.

398
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,015
Excuse us.

399
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,317
Excuse us.

400
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,295
Annie, I don't
believe this guy.

401
00:29:28,364 --> 00:29:30,798
I'm trying
to bail him out,

402
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:33,130
and he leaves
to watch television.

403
00:29:33,202 --> 00:29:35,102
He used to be normal.

404
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,137
Yeah.

405
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:12,599
Buck!

406
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,667
Whoa!

407
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:17,211
All right.

408
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:23,709
Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!

409
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,210
All right!
Home base!

410
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,582
Watch Joe's feet.

411
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:33,094
A good left fielder
knows what pitch is coming.

412
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:36,097
He can tell
from the bat's angle

413
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:38,156
which way
the ball's heading.

414
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:42,629
Show off!

415
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:45,139
Stick it
in your ear, Gandil.

416
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:48,142
If you'd have run like that
against Detroit,

417
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,144
I'd have won 20 games!

418
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:51,645
For Pete's sakes, Cicotte,

419
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:53,648
that was 68 years ago.

420
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:55,411
Give it up!

421
00:30:55,484 --> 00:30:58,942
Hey! You guys
want to play ball or what?

422
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,784
Muscle-bound jerk.

423
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:02,949
At least I got muscles.

424
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,050
At most you got muscles.

425
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:07,322
Come on, asshole!
Pitch!

426
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:09,660
Weaver... be nice.

427
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,128
Sorry, kid!

428
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:17,365
It's OK.
I don't mind.

429
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,872
All right, Karin.

430
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,068
Hey, hey, hey!

431
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:34,147
Ray?

432
00:31:34,223 --> 00:31:36,851
Honey, Mom and everybody's
leaving now.

433
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,893
OK.

434
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:41,395
Oh, well, it was...
you know.

435
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,896
Thanks for coming.

436
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:45,559
Ray, think about what I said.

437
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:48,194
I'm just trying to help.

438
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,532
I know.

439
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,937
Thought you were
watching some game.

440
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,941
It's not really a game.

441
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:55,533
It's more like practice.

442
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:01,181
There's only eight of them.

443
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,241
They can't play a real game.

444
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:08,045
Eight of what?

445
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:10,617
Them.

446
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:14,854
Who them?

447
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,295
Them them.

448
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:18,458
You don't see them?

449
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:20,968
Karin, honey,
what are you watching?

450
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:22,628
The baseball men.

451
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,799
Baseball men?

452
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:29,877
Do you see the baseball men
right now?

453
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:31,606
Of course I do.

454
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:36,641
What... you really
don't see them?

455
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:38,151
It's not very polite

456
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,656
to try to make
other people feel stupid.

457
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:43,691
Mom, w-wait a minute.

458
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:45,693
Mom! Wait a minute.

459
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:48,753
Dee. Dee, wait.
You don't see these people?

460
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,492
It's not funny, Annie.

461
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,869
They couldn't see it.

462
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,551
This is really interesting.

463
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:13,320
Hey, Ray, look at this.

464
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:16,323
68 years since I wore this uniform,

465
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:18,825
still fits me
like a glove.

466
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:21,829
You must keep
in pretty good shape.

467
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:24,832
Now let's see,
I died in '70.

468
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,836
That means I haven't
had a cigarette in 18 years.

469
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:30,895
You don't smoke, do you?

470
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:31,940
No.

471
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:33,133
Karin!

472
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,472
Ray... dinner!

473
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:37,870
Ray, dinner.

474
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:39,038
Dinner, Ray.

475
00:33:39,114 --> 00:33:41,173
All right,
all right.

476
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,684
Come on.
Let's hit the showers.

477
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:45,242
See you later.

478
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:51,486
See you, guys.

479
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,594
I'm melting!
I'm melting!

480
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,696
Come on,
you knucklehead.

481
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:07,298
That is so cool.

482
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,743
Ease his pain.

483
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:15,908
What?

484
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:20,053
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't understand.

485
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,214
What?

486
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,656
Ease his pain.

487
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:25,158
Ease his pain. What...

488
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:27,661
What the hell
does that mean,

489
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:29,424
ease his pain?

490
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:31,227
What pain?

491
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,791
All right.
Whose pain?

492
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,698
Thanks a lot.

493
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:44,435
Thanks a lot.

494
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:52,186
Come on, honey, wash up.

495
00:34:52,254 --> 00:34:55,189
We got the PTA meeting
after dinner.

496
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:57,191
Talking about
banning books again...

497
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:58,692
really subversive books,

498
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,196
like The Wizard of Oz,
Diary of Anne Frank.

499
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:03,629
What happened to you?

500
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,291
The voice is back.

501
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:08,302
You don't have to build
a football field,

502
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,302
do you?

503
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:11,305
He said,
"Ease his pain."

504
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:12,863
Ease whose pain?

505
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:15,307
I asked him.
He wouldn't say.

506
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:16,469
Shoeless Joe's?

507
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:18,172
I don't think so.

508
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,180
One of the other players?

509
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:21,647
I don't think so.

510
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:24,652
This is a very nonspecific voice
out there,

511
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,655
and he's starting
to piss me off.

512
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:31,659
I was having a fun day today...
a good day.

513
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:33,319
Want a fry?

514
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:39,966
And I say

515
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:42,003
smut and filth like this

516
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,164
has no place in our schools.

517
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:52,046
Fascist. I'd like
to ease her pain.

518
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:53,945
Mrs. Kessinik,
Mrs. Kessinik.

519
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,950
That book
you're waving about

520
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:57,451
is hardly smut.

521
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,453
It's considered
by many critics

522
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:02,456
to be the classic novel
about the 1960s.

523
00:36:02,524 --> 00:36:03,889
It's pornography!

524
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,826
No, no. The Supreme Court
says it's not.

525
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:08,920
And it's author,
Mr. Mann...

526
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:10,430
Is sick!

527
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:12,933
Terence Mann
is a Pulitzer Prize winner.

528
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:16,835
He's widely regarded
as the finest satirist of his time.

529
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,372
He's a pervert!

530
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,973
Probably a Communist, too!

531
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:22,700
What planet
are these people from?

532
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:23,867
Mr. Harris,

533
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:26,878
the so-called novels
of Terence Mann

534
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:29,972
endorse promiscuity,
godlessness,

535
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:32,381
the mongrelization
of the races,

536
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:34,716
and disrespect
to high-ranking officers

537
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:37,449
of the United States Army.

538
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:40,651
And that's why
right-thinking school boards

539
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:42,058
all across the country

540
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:45,393
having been banning
this man's s-h-i-t

541
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:47,558
since 1969.

542
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:51,199
Terence Mann?

543
00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:58,343
Y-Y-You know why
he stopped writing books.

544
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:00,208
Because he masturbates.

545
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:04,080
Excuse me, madame.

546
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:06,977
Excuse me.

547
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:12,088
Terence Mann was a warm,
gentle voice of reason

548
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:14,490
during a time
of great madness.

549
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:19,331
He coined the phrase
"Make love, not war."

550
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,832
While other people

551
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,834
were chanting
"Burn, baby, burn,"

552
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:24,836
he was talking about love

553
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:26,496
and peace
and understanding.

554
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:28,005
I cherished his books,

555
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:31,339
and I dearly wish
he had written more.

556
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:33,345
Maybe if you
had experienced

557
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:36,348
even a little bit
of the sixties,

558
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:39,351
you might feel
the same way, too.

559
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,612
I experienced
the sixties.

560
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,624
No, you had
two fifties

561
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:49,024
and moved right
into the seventies.

562
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:50,892
Annie, look at this.

563
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:53,397
Your husband
plowed under his corn

564
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:55,457
and built a baseball field.

565
00:37:56,803 --> 00:38:00,398
Now, there's
an intelligent response.

566
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:01,872
The weirdo.

567
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:04,475
Annie...

568
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,069
Honey, it's all right.
I'll be cool.

569
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:10,081
At least he is not
a book burner,

570
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:11,810
you Nazi cow.

571
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:15,687
At least
I'm not married

572
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:18,690
to the biggest horse's ass
in three counties.

573
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:21,591
All right, Beulah,
do you want to step outside?

574
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,652
Fine!

575
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:24,787
Annie.

576
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:27,331
All right, honey.

577
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,368
I've got a better idea.

578
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:32,666
Let's take a vote.
Who's for Eva Braun?

579
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,933
Who wants to burn books?

580
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:36,440
Who wants to spit

581
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:41,071
on the Constitution of the United States
of America? Anybody?

582
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:47,610
All right.

583
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:50,622
Now, who's for
the Bill of Rights?

584
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,126
Who thinks freedom is
a pretty darn good thing?

585
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:57,185
Come on! Come on!
Let's see those hands!

586
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:03,401
Who thinks
we have to stand up

587
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:06,905
to the kind of censorship
they had under Stalin?

588
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:22,187
All right.
There you go.

589
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:23,688
America, I love you.

590
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:25,189
I'm proud of you.

591
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:26,190
Let's go.

592
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:27,692
We got to go.

593
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,159
This is great!

594
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:30,661
I figured it out.

595
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,322
I figured it out.

596
00:39:32,398 --> 00:39:34,332
Was that great, or what?

597
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,833
I figured it out.

598
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:38,336
It's just like
the sixties again!

599
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:40,338
Step outside,
you Nazi cow.

600
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:43,341
I know whose pain
I'm supposed to ease.

601
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:44,842
I figured it out.

602
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:48,347
I just halted the spread
of neofascism in America...

603
00:39:48,414 --> 00:39:49,346
Terence Mann.

604
00:39:49,415 --> 00:39:50,848
What about him?

605
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,043
That's whose pain.

606
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:53,244
You sure?

607
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,652
I was right about building
the field, wasn't I?

608
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,053
Well, what's his pain?

609
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:01,059
How are you
supposed to ease it?

610
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:02,321
Well, Ann...

611
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:04,829
Look, he's my
favorite writer, too,

612
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:08,628
but what's Terence Mann
got to do with baseball?

613
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:37,528
Annie, it's incredible.

614
00:40:37,597 --> 00:40:39,030
By the early seventies,

615
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:42,033
Mann decides people have become
either too extremist

616
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,035
or too apathetic to listen.

617
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:46,037
So he stops writing books,

618
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:48,539
he starts writing
poetry about whales,

619
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:52,044
and then he starts fooling around
with a computer.

620
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:54,045
Know what he does now?

621
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:56,547
Writes software
for interactive children's videos.

622
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:58,049
They teach kids

623
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:00,551
how to resolve
their conflicts peacefully.

624
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,554
God... what an amazing guy.

625
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:04,817
What's that got
to do with baseball?

626
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,984
In the April 1962 issue
of Jet Magazine,

627
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,496
there's a story called
"This Is Not A Kite."

628
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:13,498
It's not his best work,

629
00:41:13,566 --> 00:41:16,501
but the story's hero
is named John Kinsella...

630
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:17,866
my father.

631
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:18,926
Wow.

632
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:20,939
What do you mean, "Wow"?

633
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:25,068
Big wow!
What's it got to do with baseball?

634
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:26,338
You drive.

635
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:34,552
OK, the last interview
he ever gave was in 1973.

636
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,053
Guess what it's about.

637
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:38,090
Some kind of team sport.

638
00:41:38,157 --> 00:41:40,091
Mann was
a baseball fanatic.

639
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,592
Listen to this...

640
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,094
"My earliest recurring dream

641
00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:45,596
was to play at Ebbets Field

642
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:48,600
with Jackie Robinson
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.

643
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:50,101
It never happened.

644
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:51,602
The Dodgers left Brooklyn.

645
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:53,104
Ebbets Field is gone,

646
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,436
but I still
dream that dream."

647
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:56,600
That's sad.

648
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:01,613
The man wrote the best books
of his generation.

649
00:42:01,681 --> 00:42:03,114
He was a pioneer

650
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:06,049
in the civil rights
and the antiwar movement.

651
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:08,552
I mean, he made
the cover of Newsweek.

652
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:10,555
He knew everybody.
He did everything.

653
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:12,056
He helped shape his time.

654
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:14,558
The guy hung out
with the Beatles.

655
00:42:14,627 --> 00:42:17,061
It wasn't enough.
What he missed was baseball.

656
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:18,562
Oh, my God!

657
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:19,723
What?

658
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,563
As a small boy,
he had a bat named Rosebud.

659
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:23,795
Give me that.

660
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,063
Sorry.

661
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:28,573
The guy hasn't been
to a baseball game since 1958.

662
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:31,075
So, in order to
ease his pain,

663
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:33,475
you're supposed
to take him to a ball game.

664
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:34,513
Yes.

665
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,979
Ray, this is nuttier

666
00:42:36,048 --> 00:42:37,982
than building
the baseball field.

667
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,483
No. No, it's not.

668
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:40,985
It's pretty weird,

669
00:42:41,053 --> 00:42:43,487
but building the field
was 5-10% weirder.

670
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:46,992
I'm going to have to
nip this one in the bud.

671
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:49,493
We're having moderate-to-heavy
financial difficulties here.

672
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:51,496
You can't take off for Boston

673
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:53,498
while we're going broke in lowa.

674
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:56,000
This is really
new territory for us,

675
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:58,502
but we're dealing with
primal forces of nature.

676
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:02,007
The prudent thing
is not to quibble over details.

677
00:43:02,074 --> 00:43:04,440
Yeah, but why
do you have to go?

678
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,944
Why can't the voice
send somebody else?

679
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:08,445
How about
Shirley MacLaine?

680
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:09,947
Is she too busy?

681
00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:12,449
What does this
have to do with you?

682
00:43:12,518 --> 00:43:14,952
That's what
I have to find out.

683
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,454
Ray, we are behind
on the mortgage.

684
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:20,515
That field ate up
all of our savings.

685
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:23,494
I'll sleep in the car.
I'll beg for food.

686
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:26,554
No. No! Now this is too much!

687
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:29,500
Now look.
I understand your need

688
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:31,968
to prove to yourself
and to the world

689
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:35,336
you are not turning
into your father, but you've done it.

690
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:37,308
You believed in the magic.

691
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:39,071
It happened.
Isn't that enough?

692
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:40,578
It's more than that.

693
00:43:40,646 --> 00:43:42,580
I know this is
totally nuts,

694
00:43:42,648 --> 00:43:44,582
but I'm supposed to do it.

695
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,585
I feel it as strongly
as I've felt anything.

696
00:43:47,653 --> 00:43:49,086
There's a reason.

697
00:43:49,155 --> 00:43:51,589
What? Just tell me
what it is.

698
00:43:51,657 --> 00:43:54,091
Something's going to
happen at the game.

699
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,094
There's something
at Fenway Park.

700
00:43:56,162 --> 00:44:00,098
I got to be there with Terence Mann
to find it out.

701
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,599
Is Fenway the one

702
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:04,534
with the big green wall
in left field?

703
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,867
Yeah.

704
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,372
I dreamt last night

705
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:11,410
you were at Fenway
with Terence Mann.

706
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,638
Was I sitting on
the first base side?

707
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:14,981
Yes.

708
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:17,411
About halfway
up on the aisle?

709
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:20,418
- Yeah. Eating a hot dog.
- Eating a hot dog.

710
00:44:20,486 --> 00:44:21,953
I had the same dream.

711
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:23,511
I'll help you pack.

712
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:51,138
Hi, I'm...

713
00:44:51,217 --> 00:44:53,242
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.

714
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:54,251
Hi.

715
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,252
No.

716
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:56,447
Hi.

717
00:44:56,522 --> 00:44:57,921
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.

718
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,049
It's a great pleasure
to finally get to...

719
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:03,152
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
I'm a big fan of yours.

720
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:04,161
Hi.

721
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:07,391
Hi.

722
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:09,400
How do you do, Mr. Mann?

723
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:12,835
I have to take you
to a base...

724
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:14,304
All right, stupid,

725
00:45:14,373 --> 00:45:17,308
put your hands up
and get in the trunk.

726
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:18,308
Good.

727
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:19,810
Good.

728
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:21,813
He lives right around here.

729
00:45:21,881 --> 00:45:23,314
Do you know him?

730
00:45:23,382 --> 00:45:25,816
He's sort of
a tall black man.

731
00:45:25,885 --> 00:45:27,819
I'm a friend of his.

732
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:30,321
If he was much of a friend,

733
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:33,381
he could give you
the directions himself.

734
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:37,061
That's a good point.

735
00:45:37,129 --> 00:45:38,528
Thank you.

736
00:45:38,597 --> 00:45:41,031
I don't know
where he lives.

737
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,533
Get away from me!

738
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:45,536
I ain't going to
tell you nothing.

739
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:47,037
Go away!

740
00:45:47,106 --> 00:45:48,733
You're a pest!

741
00:45:52,144 --> 00:45:54,578
Two blocks down,
right-hand side.

742
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:58,583
First door that don't have
a chicken in the window is his.

743
00:45:58,651 --> 00:45:59,709
No chicken.

744
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,398
Who the hell are you?

745
00:46:49,635 --> 00:46:52,001
Sir, my name's
Ray Kinsella.

746
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,024
We got
a learning disability here?

747
00:47:13,092 --> 00:47:15,526
If I could just
have one minute, please.

748
00:47:15,594 --> 00:47:18,529
Look, I can't tell you
the secret of life,

749
00:47:18,597 --> 00:47:21,157
and I don't have
any answers for you.

750
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:22,666
I don't give interviews,

751
00:47:22,735 --> 00:47:24,896
and I'm no longer
a public figure.

752
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:28,337
I just want to be
left alone, so piss off.

753
00:47:28,407 --> 00:47:29,339
Wait!

754
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:30,500
Wait!

755
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:33,340
Look, I've come
1,500 miles to see you

756
00:47:33,412 --> 00:47:35,846
at the risk of losing
my home

757
00:47:35,915 --> 00:47:37,348
and alienating my wife.

758
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,748
All I'm asking
is one minute.

759
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,979
Please.

760
00:47:45,624 --> 00:47:47,387
One minute.

761
00:47:56,135 --> 00:47:59,070
OK, I understand
your desire for privacy,

762
00:47:59,138 --> 00:48:01,572
and I wouldn't
dream of intruding

763
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,631
if this weren't
extremely important.

764
00:48:03,709 --> 00:48:05,006
Oh, God.

765
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:07,841
I don't do causes anymore.

766
00:48:07,913 --> 00:48:09,437
This isn't a cause.

767
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:12,450
I don't need money
or an endorsement.

768
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:13,507
Refreshing.

769
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:16,020
You once wrote,
"There comes a time

770
00:48:16,088 --> 00:48:17,521
when all the cosmic tumblers

771
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,023
have clicked into place

772
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:22,026
and the universe
opens itself up for a few seconds

773
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:24,494
to show you what's possible."

774
00:48:24,563 --> 00:48:26,394
Oh, my God!

775
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:27,989
What?

776
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:29,329
You're from the sixties.

777
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:31,426
Well, yeah. Actually...

778
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:33,596
Out!

779
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:34,604
Hey!

780
00:48:34,673 --> 00:48:35,935
Back to the sixties!

781
00:48:36,008 --> 00:48:37,976
No place for you
here in the future.

782
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:41,479
Get back while you still can!

783
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:43,640
You've changed,

784
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:45,149
you know that?

785
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:46,878
Yes, I suppose I have.

786
00:48:46,952 --> 00:48:49,386
How about this?
Peace, love, dope.

787
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:52,185
Now get the hell
out of here!

788
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,035
You've really pissed me off.

789
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,229
Hold it.

790
00:49:39,305 --> 00:49:42,468
I was hoping I wouldn't
have to do it this way.

791
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:44,065
What the hell is that?

792
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:46,202
It's a gun.

793
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:47,302
It's your finger.

794
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:48,903
No, it's a gun.

795
00:49:48,981 --> 00:49:50,209
Let me see it.

796
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,716
I'm not going to
show you my gun.

797
00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:54,719
I'm not going
to hurt you.

798
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:57,051
I need you
to come with...

799
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:59,056
What are you doing?

800
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:02,355
I'll beat you with a crowbar
until you go away.

801
00:50:02,428 --> 00:50:04,487
Whoa! Wait!
You can't do that.

802
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:05,996
There are rules here?

803
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:08,499
Oh, no.
There are no rules here.

804
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:11,058
You're a pacifist!

805
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:17,271
Shit.

806
00:50:17,343 --> 00:50:18,537
Thank you.

807
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,872
Thank you.

808
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:22,812
So what?
You kidnapping me?

809
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:24,314
What's the deal here?

810
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,180
I was...

811
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:27,684
I was hoping

812
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:31,416
I could just convince you
to come with me.

813
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,014
So you are
kidnapping me?

814
00:50:33,092 --> 00:50:37,859
I have to take you
to a baseball game.

815
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,056
You what?

816
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:40,598
Tonight's game.

817
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,725
Red Sox, A's.

818
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,359
Why?

819
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:45,869
Something will happen there.

820
00:50:45,938 --> 00:50:50,432
I don't know what,
but we'll find out when it does.

821
00:50:51,944 --> 00:50:53,377
My name's Ray Kinsella.

822
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:55,379
You used my father's name

823
00:50:55,447 --> 00:50:58,211
for a character
in one of your stories.

824
00:50:58,283 --> 00:50:59,375
John Kinsella.

825
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:01,476
You're seeing
a whole team of psychiatrists,

826
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:02,815
aren't you?

827
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:05,755
I don't blame you
for thinking that,

828
00:51:05,824 --> 00:51:07,257
but, no, I'm not.

829
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:08,759
I swear to God,

830
00:51:08,827 --> 00:51:11,557
I'm the least crazy person
I've ever known.

831
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,326
Why are you kidnapping me
to a baseball game?

832
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,800
May I s...

833
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:20,168
Oh, please.
Want a cup of coffee?

834
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:22,707
No.

835
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:24,072
Want some cookies?

836
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:27,176
No.

837
00:51:27,246 --> 00:51:31,182
I read an interview
you gave a long time ago

838
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,583
about how you always dreamed
of playing at Ebbets Field

839
00:51:34,653 --> 00:51:37,588
and how sad you felt
when they tore it down.

840
00:51:37,656 --> 00:51:39,089
I never said that.

841
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:40,853
You didn't?

842
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:43,451
I don't even recall
thinking that.

843
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,133
Weird.

844
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,104
This whole...

845
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:58,200
This whole thing
is so weird.

846
00:51:58,277 --> 00:52:00,745
Then why go through with it?

847
00:52:04,116 --> 00:52:06,050
It's a long story.

848
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:13,250
But it's a really good story.

849
00:52:13,325 --> 00:52:15,225
I'll tell you on the way.

850
00:52:15,294 --> 00:52:17,728
I'm not getting rid
of you, am I?

851
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:19,229
Come to this game.

852
00:52:19,298 --> 00:52:21,232
I'll never bother you again,

853
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,667
not even f...
not even a Christmas card.

854
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:36,047
So what do you do
with yourself these days?

855
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:37,911
I live, I work.

856
00:52:37,983 --> 00:52:39,917
I learned how to cook.

857
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:43,751
I take walks
and watch sunsets.

858
00:52:43,822 --> 00:52:45,756
Don't you miss
being involved?

859
00:52:45,824 --> 00:52:49,658
I was the East Coast distributor
of involved.

860
00:52:49,728 --> 00:52:52,891
I ate it and drank it
and breathed it.

861
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:56,264
Then they killed
Martin and Bobby,

862
00:52:56,335 --> 00:52:58,496
they elected
Tricky Dick twice,

863
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,006
and now people like you
think I must be miserable

864
00:53:02,074 --> 00:53:03,507
because I'm not
involved anymore.

865
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:05,008
I've got news for you.

866
00:53:05,077 --> 00:53:07,511
I spent all my misery
years ago.

867
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:10,776
I have no more pain left
for any of you.

868
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:13,283
I gave at the office.

869
00:53:13,352 --> 00:53:15,286
So what do you want?

870
00:53:15,354 --> 00:53:18,790
I want them to stop
looking to me for answers,

871
00:53:18,857 --> 00:53:20,518
begging me to speak again,

872
00:53:20,592 --> 00:53:22,287
write again, be a leader.

873
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:24,795
I want them to start
thinking for themselves.

874
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,661
I want my privacy.

875
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:31,794
No, I meant
what do you want?

876
00:53:35,307 --> 00:53:36,740
Oh.

877
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:39,470
Dog and a beer.

878
00:53:41,813 --> 00:53:43,246
Two.

879
00:53:43,315 --> 00:53:45,249
10 bucks.

880
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:46,750
OK, I understand you.

881
00:53:46,818 --> 00:53:50,254
You should be entitled
to as much privacy as you want,

882
00:53:50,322 --> 00:53:51,755
but why stop writing?

883
00:53:51,823 --> 00:53:54,257
I haven't published
a word in 17 years,

884
00:53:54,326 --> 00:53:57,261
and still I have to endure
lunatics like you.

885
00:53:57,329 --> 00:53:59,263
What do you
think would happen

886
00:53:59,331 --> 00:54:02,266
if I suddenly came out
with a new book?

887
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:03,824
They'd bleed me dry.

888
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:20,512
Go the distance.

889
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:30,692
Go the distance.

890
00:54:49,514 --> 00:54:51,641
What's the matter?

891
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,785
You didn't see that?

892
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:58,447
See what?

893
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:07,197
I'm sorry. I guess you
didn't have to be here.

894
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:08,493
What?

895
00:55:11,703 --> 00:55:14,763
Whenever you want to go,
we can go.

896
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,467
Fine. Let's go.

897
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:05,622
What is it you're
not telling me?

898
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,182
I've already taken up
too much of your time.

899
00:56:20,705 --> 00:56:23,640
I wish I had
your passion, Ray.

900
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,642
Misdirected though it might be,

901
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,644
it is still a passion.

902
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:31,478
I used to feel that way
about things, but...

903
00:56:34,052 --> 00:56:36,111
You got another message,
didn't you?

904
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,122
You'll think I'm crazy.

905
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,680
I already think you're crazy.

906
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:41,225
What did it say?

907
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:46,663
It said,
"The man's done enough.

908
00:56:46,731 --> 00:56:48,221
Leave him alone."

909
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:10,112
"Moonlight" Graham.

910
00:57:10,188 --> 00:57:11,917
You saw it.

911
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,958
Saw what?

912
00:57:14,025 --> 00:57:16,459
You saw it.
New York Giants, 1922.

913
00:57:16,528 --> 00:57:19,224
He played one game.
He never got to bat.

914
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:20,730
What did I see?

915
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:21,731
Chisholm, Minnesota.

916
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,234
We were the only ones
who saw it.

917
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,236
Did you hear
the voice, too?

918
00:57:26,304 --> 00:57:29,068
It's what told me
to find you.

919
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,630
Did you hear it?

920
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,474
"Go the distance"?

921
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,415
Yes. Do you know
what it means?

922
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:39,415
Yes.

923
00:57:39,484 --> 00:57:40,473
What?

924
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:42,486
It means we're going
to Minnesota

925
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:44,044
to find
"Moonlight" Graham.

926
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:45,555
We're going... We?

927
00:57:45,624 --> 00:57:48,058
I must be out of my mind.

928
00:57:48,126 --> 00:57:50,560
What do we do
when we find him?

929
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:53,063
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

930
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:54,564
That's right.
You're right.

931
00:57:54,633 --> 00:57:56,260
You're right.

932
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:57,631
This is so bitchin'.

933
00:57:57,702 --> 00:57:59,636
I don't believe
I'm doing this.

934
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,090
Hey, Annie, guess what?

935
00:58:19,157 --> 00:58:20,590
I'm with Terence Mann.

936
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:23,093
Oh, my God.
You kidnapped him.

937
00:58:23,161 --> 00:58:25,595
No, I didn't.
He wanted to.

938
00:58:25,664 --> 00:58:29,031
Sorry, but I'm going to
be a few days longer.

939
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,590
We're going to Minnesota.

940
00:58:30,669 --> 00:58:33,160
I don't believe this.
What's in Minnesota?

941
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:34,671
An old ball player.

942
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:36,673
I'll explain when I get home.

943
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:38,675
How are things with you?

944
00:58:38,743 --> 00:58:39,675
Fine.

945
00:58:39,744 --> 00:58:42,679
Great. Look, Ann,
I got to go, OK?

946
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:45,181
Give Karin a hug for me,

947
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,013
and I love you.

948
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:48,484
I love you, too.

949
00:58:48,553 --> 00:58:51,989
Hey, someday explain
all this to me, OK?

950
00:58:52,057 --> 00:58:53,183
I'll try.

951
00:58:53,258 --> 00:58:54,486
Bye-bye.

952
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,548
Bye.

953
00:59:02,434 --> 00:59:04,629
Why didn't you tell him?

954
00:59:06,638 --> 00:59:09,630
Annie, you got no choice
in the matter.

955
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:16,003
Half a dozen Grahams.

956
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:17,776
No Archibald.

957
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,407
No "Moonlight."

958
00:59:20,785 --> 00:59:22,116
Follow me.

959
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:35,164
Hello.

960
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:38,168
Excuse me.
Maybe you can help us.

961
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:40,761
We're looking for
an ex-baseball player

962
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:42,272
named Archibald Graham.

963
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,967
Oh, you mean
Doc Graham.

964
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:46,442
No. I think his nickname
was "Moonlight."

965
00:59:46,511 --> 00:59:48,069
Well, that's Dr. Graham.

966
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:49,170
Dr. Graham?

967
00:59:49,247 --> 00:59:52,148
His baseball career
never amounted to much.

968
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:53,809
He went back to school.

969
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:55,477
His father was a doctor.

970
00:59:55,553 --> 00:59:57,987
Do you know
where we can find him?

971
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:00,684
It's nothing bad.
We're not from the IRS.

972
01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:03,125
Doc Graham is dead.

973
01:00:03,194 --> 01:00:05,822
He died in 1972.

974
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:09,799
"And there were times

975
01:00:09,868 --> 01:00:11,460
when children could not afford

976
01:00:11,536 --> 01:00:13,026
eyeglasses or milk or clothing.

977
01:00:13,104 --> 01:00:15,834
Yet, no child was ever denied
these essentials

978
01:00:15,907 --> 01:00:17,340
because, in the background,

979
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:19,343
there was always Dr. Graham.

980
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,345
Without any fanfare
or publicity,

981
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,347
the glasses or the milk

982
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:26,350
or the ticket
to the ball game

983
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:29,353
found their way into
the child's pocket."

984
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:30,817
You wrote that.

985
01:00:30,887 --> 01:00:32,320
The day he died.

986
01:00:32,389 --> 01:00:33,822
Can I see that?

987
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,323
You're a good writer.

988
01:00:36,393 --> 01:00:37,883
So are you.

989
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:44,966
Something's missing.

990
01:00:46,737 --> 01:00:50,173
Well, he sounds like
he was a wonderful man.

991
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,904
Half the towns in North America
have a Doc Graham.

992
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:56,912
What makes this one
so special

993
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,915
we travel across the country
to find him

994
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:01,917
16 years after he died?

995
01:01:01,985 --> 01:01:03,976
There's got to be more.

996
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,250
What else?

997
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:13,990
He always wore
an overcoat,

998
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:15,656
he had white hair,

999
01:01:15,732 --> 01:01:18,166
and he always
carried an umbrella.

1000
01:01:18,235 --> 01:01:19,725
What was the umbrella for?

1001
01:01:19,803 --> 01:01:21,737
It got to be a habit,

1002
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:23,238
something to hang on to.

1003
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:25,240
He said he used it

1004
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:27,833
to beat away
his lady admirers.

1005
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:29,503
Tell me about his wife.

1006
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:32,139
Alicia.

1007
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:35,048
She moved to
South Carolina

1008
01:01:35,118 --> 01:01:37,143
after Doc passed.

1009
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,553
She passed
a couple years later.

1010
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:43,525
She always wore blue.

1011
01:01:43,593 --> 01:01:46,426
The shopkeepers in town

1012
01:01:46,496 --> 01:01:48,964
would stock blue hats

1013
01:01:49,032 --> 01:01:52,433
because they knew
if Doc walked by,

1014
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:55,164
he'd buy one.

1015
01:01:55,238 --> 01:01:58,366
When they cleaned out
his office,

1016
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:02,845
they found boxes of blue hats

1017
01:02:02,913 --> 01:02:06,178
that he never
got around to give her.

1018
01:02:06,249 --> 01:02:08,717
I'll bet you
didn't know that.

1019
01:02:08,785 --> 01:02:10,548
No, I didn't.

1020
01:02:13,757 --> 01:02:16,191
No screwing,
no drinking,

1021
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:19,854
no opium,
no midnight abortions,

1022
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:22,091
no illegitimate children,

1023
01:02:22,165 --> 01:02:24,190
no shady finances.

1024
01:02:24,267 --> 01:02:26,701
You sound disappointed.

1025
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:29,204
Shoeless Joe had a problem.

1026
01:02:29,272 --> 01:02:31,206
That's why he needed you.

1027
01:02:31,274 --> 01:02:33,902
This guy doesn't need us.

1028
01:02:33,977 --> 01:02:34,966
Terence.

1029
01:02:37,113 --> 01:02:39,104
Do you know
you're missing?

1030
01:02:43,954 --> 01:02:45,649
Oh, God.

1031
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,224
"His father,
who lives in Baltimore,

1032
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:50,224
notified police

1033
01:02:50,293 --> 01:02:51,726
after receiving no answer

1034
01:02:51,795 --> 01:02:53,228
to repeated telephone calls."

1035
01:02:53,296 --> 01:02:55,230
Shoot.

1036
01:02:55,298 --> 01:02:56,993
I better call him.

1037
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:59,001
You, uh, want me to...

1038
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:00,058
Thanks.

1039
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:09,301
I'm taking a walk.
Be back in a while.

1040
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:16,642
What do I tell him?

1041
01:03:44,147 --> 01:03:46,081
"This year's"?

1042
01:04:27,591 --> 01:04:29,115
Dr. Graham?

1043
01:04:38,335 --> 01:04:39,427
Dr. Graham?

1044
01:04:43,273 --> 01:04:45,298
My name's Ray Kinsella.

1045
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,036
I'm from lowa.

1046
01:04:49,713 --> 01:04:51,647
Are you
"Moonlight" Graham?

1047
01:04:56,786 --> 01:05:00,779
No one's called me
"Moonlight" Graham in 50 years.

1048
01:05:00,857 --> 01:05:04,759
Well, I've come
a very long way to see you.

1049
01:05:04,828 --> 01:05:06,056
I couldn't sleep tonight.

1050
01:05:06,129 --> 01:05:08,222
Usually I sleep like a baby.

1051
01:05:08,298 --> 01:05:11,096
I told Alicia
I was taking a walk.

1052
01:05:12,302 --> 01:05:14,896
Do you mind if I join you?

1053
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:16,836
I'd like to talk to you.

1054
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:20,467
Let's walk over
to my office.

1055
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:23,569
What do you want
to talk to me about?

1056
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,581
When you got
to the majors,

1057
01:05:25,649 --> 01:05:28,584
you played only
one inning of one game.

1058
01:05:28,652 --> 01:05:30,677
What happened with you?

1059
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:33,348
It was the last day
of the season,

1060
01:05:33,423 --> 01:05:36,051
bottom of the eighth,
we were way ahead.

1061
01:05:36,126 --> 01:05:39,061
In three weeks,
I hadn't seen any action.

1062
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:41,859
Suddenly old John McGraw
points a bony finger

1063
01:05:41,931 --> 01:05:43,364
in my direction

1064
01:05:43,433 --> 01:05:45,367
and he says, "Right field."

1065
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:46,527
I jumped up

1066
01:05:46,603 --> 01:05:49,367
like I was sitting
on a spring,

1067
01:05:49,439 --> 01:05:50,872
grabbed my glove,

1068
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,431
and ran out
on the field.

1069
01:05:55,945 --> 01:05:58,379
Did you get
to make a play?

1070
01:05:58,448 --> 01:06:01,884
They never hit the ball
out of the infield.

1071
01:06:01,951 --> 01:06:04,943
The game ended.
The season was over.

1072
01:06:06,122 --> 01:06:09,057
I knew they'd
send me back down.

1073
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,059
I couldn't bear the thought

1074
01:06:11,127 --> 01:06:13,561
of another year
in the minors.

1075
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,622
So I decided
to hang them up.

1076
01:06:18,301 --> 01:06:19,734
Go on. Sit down.

1077
01:06:19,803 --> 01:06:20,792
Thank you.

1078
01:06:23,173 --> 01:06:25,505
So what was that like?

1079
01:06:25,575 --> 01:06:29,011
It was like coming this close
to your dreams,

1080
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:31,172
then watch them
brush past you,

1081
01:06:31,247 --> 01:06:34,239
like a stranger
in a crowd.

1082
01:06:34,317 --> 01:06:36,512
Then, you don't think about it.

1083
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:38,019
We just don't recognize

1084
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:39,521
life's most significant moments

1085
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:40,647
while they're happening.

1086
01:06:40,724 --> 01:06:42,191
Back then I thought,

1087
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:44,192
"Well, there'll be other days."

1088
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:47,752
I didn't realize that
that was the only day.

1089
01:06:49,265 --> 01:06:52,200
And now, I want to
ask you a question.

1090
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:54,702
What's so interesting
about half an inning

1091
01:06:54,771 --> 01:06:56,705
that you'd come from lowa

1092
01:06:56,773 --> 01:06:59,207
to talk to me about it

1093
01:06:59,275 --> 01:07:01,243
50 years after it happened?

1094
01:07:01,311 --> 01:07:04,212
I didn't really know
till just now,

1095
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,044
but I think it's to ask you

1096
01:07:07,117 --> 01:07:10,052
if you could do
anything you wanted,

1097
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,180
if you could have
a... a wish...

1098
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:18,055
And you're the kind of a man

1099
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:20,153
who could grant me that wish?

1100
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:24,257
I don't know.
I'm just asking.

1101
01:07:25,468 --> 01:07:26,901
Well, you know,

1102
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:29,666
I never got to bat
in the major leagues.

1103
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:32,674
I'd have liked to have had
that chance, just once,

1104
01:07:32,742 --> 01:07:35,677
to stare down
a big-league pitcher.

1105
01:07:35,745 --> 01:07:38,680
Then just as he goes
into his windup, wink.

1106
01:07:38,748 --> 01:07:41,683
Make him think you know
something he doesn't.

1107
01:07:41,751 --> 01:07:43,685
That's what I wish for...

1108
01:07:43,753 --> 01:07:46,688
The chance to squint
at a sky so blue

1109
01:07:46,756 --> 01:07:49,520
it hurts your eyes
to look at it,

1110
01:07:49,592 --> 01:07:53,028
to feel the tingle in your arms
as you connect with the ball,

1111
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:54,028
run bases...

1112
01:07:54,097 --> 01:07:56,531
stretching a double
into a triple

1113
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:59,033
and flop face first
into third,

1114
01:07:59,102 --> 01:08:01,536
wrap your arms
around the bag.

1115
01:08:01,604 --> 01:08:04,004
That's my wish.
That's my wish.

1116
01:08:04,073 --> 01:08:05,973
Is there enough
magic out there

1117
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:10,376
in the moonlight to make
this dream come true?

1118
01:08:10,446 --> 01:08:13,074
What would you say
if I said yes?

1119
01:08:13,149 --> 01:08:16,243
I think I'd
actually believe you.

1120
01:08:17,787 --> 01:08:20,722
There's a place
where things like that happen.

1121
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,759
If you want to go,
I can take you.

1122
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,629
This is my most
special place

1123
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:31,132
in all the world.

1124
01:08:31,201 --> 01:08:34,136
Once a place
touches you like this,

1125
01:08:34,204 --> 01:08:36,968
the wind never blows
so cold again.

1126
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,771
You feel...
like it was your child.

1127
01:08:42,712 --> 01:08:44,703
I can't leave Chisholm.

1128
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:46,373
I un... I understand

1129
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:47,973
I do.

1130
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:51,645
But I really think

1131
01:08:51,721 --> 01:08:53,523
you're supposed
to come with us.

1132
01:08:53,523 --> 01:08:54,490
You're supposed
to come with us.

1133
01:08:54,557 --> 01:08:55,683
No.

1134
01:08:59,228 --> 01:09:01,093
But your wish?

1135
01:09:01,163 --> 01:09:03,097
Lt'll have to stay a wish.

1136
01:09:03,165 --> 01:09:06,157
I was born here,
I lived here,

1137
01:09:06,235 --> 01:09:08,795
I'll die here,
but no regrets.

1138
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:11,305
50 years ago,
for 5 minutes

1139
01:09:11,374 --> 01:09:12,807
you came this close.

1140
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,809
It would kill some men

1141
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:17,812
to get that close
to their dream

1142
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,313
and not touch it.

1143
01:09:19,382 --> 01:09:22,180
God. They'd consider it
a tragedy.

1144
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:23,684
If I'd only gotten

1145
01:09:23,753 --> 01:09:26,517
to be a doctor
for five minutes,

1146
01:09:26,589 --> 01:09:29,524
now that would
have been a tragedy.

1147
01:09:30,893 --> 01:09:31,825
[Clock Chimes]

1148
01:09:31,894 --> 01:09:33,828
I better be getting home.

1149
01:09:33,896 --> 01:09:37,127
Alicia will think
I got a girlfriend.

1150
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,224
And he smiled.

1151
01:09:41,203 --> 01:09:42,636
And then I figured,

1152
01:09:42,705 --> 01:09:45,640
maybe we're not supposed
to take him with us.

1153
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:47,198
I don't know.

1154
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:50,144
I don't know
why in the hell

1155
01:09:50,212 --> 01:09:51,975
we were supposed
to come here.

1156
01:09:52,048 --> 01:09:53,982
Maybe it's to find out

1157
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,848
if one inning
can change the world.

1158
01:09:56,919 --> 01:09:58,352
Think it did?

1159
01:09:58,421 --> 01:09:59,854
Did for these people.

1160
01:09:59,922 --> 01:10:01,856
If he'd gotten a hit,

1161
01:10:01,924 --> 01:10:04,358
he might have stayed
in baseball.

1162
01:10:04,427 --> 01:10:05,860
I don't know.

1163
01:10:05,928 --> 01:10:07,361
Oh, your wife called.

1164
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,558
She wants you
to call her tonight.

1165
01:10:11,634 --> 01:10:13,431
[Telephone Rings]

1166
01:10:14,437 --> 01:10:15,369
[Ring]

1167
01:10:15,438 --> 01:10:16,370
Ray?

1168
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:17,497
Ohh.

1169
01:10:17,573 --> 01:10:21,009
I'm fine. I'm just
so glad it's you.

1170
01:10:21,077 --> 01:10:23,511
Listen, I talked
to the bank,

1171
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,012
and I asked them

1172
01:10:25,081 --> 01:10:28,016
if we could miss
a payment or two,

1173
01:10:28,084 --> 01:10:29,449
and they told me

1174
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:33,614
that they had just sold
the note on the farm

1175
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:36,556
to Mark...
and his partners.

1176
01:10:36,626 --> 01:10:39,390
Right.
So they own the paper now.

1177
01:10:39,462 --> 01:10:42,397
He says if we don't
sell to them,

1178
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:44,057
they're going to foreclose.

1179
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:48,297
Ray, we don't have the money.

1180
01:10:48,371 --> 01:10:51,169
Look, um, I've got
to take Mr. Mann

1181
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,673
back to Boston first.

1182
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:54,437
OK? So it's, uh...

1183
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:55,977
No.

1184
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:57,569
Wait a second.

1185
01:10:57,647 --> 01:10:59,672
I'm going to lowa with you.

1186
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:04,477
We're coming home.

1187
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,224
Hell, I can't quit now.

1188
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:12,726
I got to see this ball park.

1189
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:14,729
Not everyone can see it.

1190
01:11:14,797 --> 01:11:16,196
You might not.

1191
01:11:16,265 --> 01:11:17,892
Give it a try.

1192
01:11:23,305 --> 01:11:26,638
I need all the karma
I can get right now.

1193
01:11:32,348 --> 01:11:34,782
Thanks. You're the first car by.

1194
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,283
How far you going?

1195
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:37,785
How far you going?

1196
01:11:37,853 --> 01:11:38,842
Lowa.

1197
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:41,788
If it's OK, I'll just
ride along a while.

1198
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:43,347
I play baseball.

1199
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,792
Hop in.

1200
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:46,850
All right.

1201
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:56,967
I'm looking
for a place to play.

1202
01:11:57,039 --> 01:11:59,974
I heard that all
through the Midwest,

1203
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:01,976
they have towns with teams.

1204
01:12:02,044 --> 01:12:05,138
In some places,
they'll find you a day job

1205
01:12:05,214 --> 01:12:08,149
so you can play ball
nights and weekends.

1206
01:12:08,217 --> 01:12:09,650
It's your lucky day.

1207
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,654
We're going someplace
kind of like that.

1208
01:12:12,722 --> 01:12:13,654
All right.

1209
01:12:13,723 --> 01:12:15,156
I'm Ray Kinsella.

1210
01:12:15,224 --> 01:12:16,657
This is Terence Mann.

1211
01:12:16,726 --> 01:12:17,658
Hi.

1212
01:12:17,727 --> 01:12:19,558
I'm Archie Graham.

1213
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:34,104
It's funny the way
he described towns

1214
01:12:34,176 --> 01:12:35,837
finding you a job

1215
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:38,505
so you could play
on their team.

1216
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:40,446
They haven't done that
for years.

1217
01:12:40,516 --> 01:12:42,746
Dad did that
for a while,

1218
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:45,286
but that was
in the twenties.

1219
01:12:45,354 --> 01:12:47,083
What happened to your father?

1220
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:50,125
He never made it
as a ballplayer.

1221
01:12:50,192 --> 01:12:53,355
He wanted his son
to make it for him.

1222
01:12:53,429 --> 01:12:55,863
By 10, playing baseball
got to be

1223
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:58,866
like eating vegetables
or taking out garbage.

1224
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:01,869
When I was 14,
I started to refuse.

1225
01:13:01,937 --> 01:13:03,370
Can you believe that?

1226
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:06,203
American boy refusing
to have a catch

1227
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:08,402
with his father?

1228
01:13:08,477 --> 01:13:09,910
Why 14?

1229
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:13,540
That's when I read The Boat Rocker
by Terence Mann.

1230
01:13:13,616 --> 01:13:16,380
I never played catch
with him again.

1231
01:13:16,452 --> 01:13:19,387
That's the crap
people always lay on me.

1232
01:13:19,455 --> 01:13:20,888
It's not my fault

1233
01:13:20,956 --> 01:13:23,220
you wouldn't
play catch with him.

1234
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:24,782
I know.

1235
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:29,158
Anyway, when I was 17,

1236
01:13:29,231 --> 01:13:30,664
I packed my things,

1237
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:32,826
said something awful,
and left.

1238
01:13:33,903 --> 01:13:36,667
After a while,
I wanted to come home,

1239
01:13:36,739 --> 01:13:38,673
but I didn't know how.

1240
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:41,733
Made it back
for the funeral, though.

1241
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,912
What was the awful thing
you said?

1242
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:56,914
To your father?

1243
01:13:58,427 --> 01:13:59,519
Oh...

1244
01:13:59,595 --> 01:14:02,530
I said I could
never respect a man

1245
01:14:02,598 --> 01:14:04,589
whose hero was a criminal.

1246
01:14:05,768 --> 01:14:07,360
Who was his hero?

1247
01:14:08,771 --> 01:14:10,568
Shoeless Joe Jackson.

1248
01:14:12,441 --> 01:14:14,875
You knew
he wasn't a criminal.

1249
01:14:14,944 --> 01:14:17,435
Then why did you say it?

1250
01:14:18,948 --> 01:14:20,506
I was 17.

1251
01:14:22,952 --> 01:14:25,386
The son of a bitch died

1252
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:27,945
before I could take it back.

1253
01:14:29,391 --> 01:14:31,382
Before I could tell him...

1254
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:34,218
you know.

1255
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:38,890
He never met my wife.

1256
01:14:40,402 --> 01:14:42,427
He never saw
his granddaughter.

1257
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,130
This is your penance.

1258
01:14:47,209 --> 01:14:48,574
I know.

1259
01:14:48,644 --> 01:14:51,169
I can't bring
my father back.

1260
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:55,684
So the least you can do
is bring back his hero.

1261
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:56,809
Well...

1262
01:14:59,588 --> 01:15:02,580
Now I know what
everybody's purpose here is...

1263
01:15:03,926 --> 01:15:05,154
except mine.

1264
01:15:10,432 --> 01:15:11,558
Hey.

1265
01:15:36,892 --> 01:15:38,325
Daddy!

1266
01:15:38,394 --> 01:15:40,055
Karin, come here.

1267
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:44,331
Hi!

1268
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,332
Oh...

1269
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:46,834
We missed you.

1270
01:15:46,902 --> 01:15:48,335
Are you, OK?

1271
01:15:48,404 --> 01:15:50,531
Yeah. This is
Terence Mann.

1272
01:15:50,606 --> 01:15:51,971
Terry.

1273
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:52,973
Welcome.

1274
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:54,566
Hi, Terry.

1275
01:15:54,643 --> 01:15:58,135
And this young fella is...
This is Archie Graham.

1276
01:15:58,213 --> 01:15:59,703
Archie.

1277
01:15:59,782 --> 01:16:02,342
He's come to practice
with the team.

1278
01:16:02,418 --> 01:16:05,649
He'll be able to do
a lot more than that.

1279
01:16:05,721 --> 01:16:07,154
What does that mean?

1280
01:16:14,163 --> 01:16:15,596
What do you say?

1281
01:16:15,664 --> 01:16:17,097
What do you say?

1282
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,599
Hey, Ray.

1283
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:20,692
Welcome back.

1284
01:16:20,769 --> 01:16:21,701
Thanks, Joe.

1285
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:23,203
Oh, my God.

1286
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:24,204
What?

1287
01:16:24,273 --> 01:16:25,706
That's Shoeless Joe Jackson.

1288
01:16:25,774 --> 01:16:27,309
Of course it is.

1289
01:16:27,442 --> 01:16:28,773
You didn't believe me?

1290
01:16:28,843 --> 01:16:30,708
I thought I did, but...

1291
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:32,542
Oh, my God.

1292
01:16:33,915 --> 01:16:34,882
Hi, Annie.

1293
01:16:34,949 --> 01:16:35,881
Hi, Joe.

1294
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,383
Good to see you.

1295
01:16:37,452 --> 01:16:38,885
Terry, I'd like you

1296
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:41,148
to meet Shoeless Joe Jackson.

1297
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,156
Joe, Terry Mann.

1298
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,158
It's a pleasure meeting you.

1299
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,818
The pleasure's mine.

1300
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:49,830
We got tired of
just having practices,

1301
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:52,332
so we brought
another team out

1302
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,834
so we'd have
some real games.

1303
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,336
I don't mind.

1304
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:58,599
Where'd they come from?

1305
01:16:58,673 --> 01:17:00,334
Where did we come from?

1306
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:02,342
So many wanted to play here.

1307
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,935
We had to beat them off
with a stick.

1308
01:17:05,013 --> 01:17:06,947
Hey, that's Smokey Joe Wood

1309
01:17:07,015 --> 01:17:09,176
and Mel Ott

1310
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,717
and Gil Hodges.

1311
01:17:10,785 --> 01:17:12,719
Ty Cobb wanted to play.

1312
01:17:12,787 --> 01:17:15,722
Nobody could stand him
when we were alive.

1313
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,315
We told him to stick it.

1314
01:17:20,862 --> 01:17:22,022
Hey...

1315
01:17:22,097 --> 01:17:24,156
are you Graham?

1316
01:17:24,232 --> 01:17:25,358
Yes, sir.

1317
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:27,867
Why are you

And they'll come

They'll think
it's really boring.

So they'll want to pay us.

To watch the games.

1448

It will be just like

All right. This is fascinating,
but you don't have the money...

to bring the mortgage
up to date.

They'll come to lowa

1462
01:23:44,078 --> 01:23:46,512
for reasons
they can't even fathom.

1463
01:23:46,581 --> 01:23:48,515
They'll turn up your driveway,

1464
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:51,518
not knowing for sure
why they're doing it.

1465
01:23:51,586 --> 01:23:53,520
They'll arrive at your door

1466
01:23:53,588 --> 01:23:56,523
as innocent as children,
longing for the past.

1467
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:58,525
"Of course, we won't mind

1468
01:23:58,593 --> 01:24:01,027
if you look around,"
you'll say.

1469
01:24:01,095 --> 01:24:03,359
"It's only $20 per person."

1470
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:05,365
They'll pass over the money

1471
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:07,367
without even thinking about it.

1472
01:24:07,435 --> 01:24:12,031
For it is money they have
and peace they like.

1473
01:24:12,106 --> 01:24:13,869
Just sign the papers.

1474
01:24:13,941 --> 01:24:16,876
Then they'll walk
out to the bleachers

1475
01:24:16,944 --> 01:24:19,378
and sit in their shirt sleeves

1476
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:21,244
on a perfect afternoon.

1477
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:26,385
They'll find
they have reserved seats

1478
01:24:26,454 --> 01:24:28,888
somewhere along one
of the baselines,

1479
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:32,323
where they sat
when they were children

1480
01:24:32,393 --> 01:24:34,327
and cheered their heroes,

1481
01:24:34,395 --> 01:24:36,329
and they'll watch the game,

1482
01:24:36,397 --> 01:24:37,830
and it will be

1483
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:41,335
as if they dipped themselves
in magic waters.

1484
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:43,836
The memories
will be so thick,

1485
01:24:43,905 --> 01:24:48,475
they'll have to brush them away
from their faces.

1486
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,335
Ray, when the bank opens
in the morning,

1487
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:51,843
they'll foreclose.

1488
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:53,902
People will come, Ray.

1489
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,413
You're broke, Ray.

1490
01:24:55,482 --> 01:24:58,349
You sell now,
or you lose everything.

1491
01:24:58,418 --> 01:25:01,353
The one constant through
all the years, Ray,

1492
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:02,854
has been baseball.

1493
01:25:02,922 --> 01:25:04,355
America has rolled by

1494
01:25:04,424 --> 01:25:06,358
like an army of steamrollers.

1495
01:25:06,426 --> 01:25:09,190
It's been erased
like a blackboard,

1496
01:25:09,262 --> 01:25:11,287
rebuilt, and erased again.

1497
01:25:12,432 --> 01:25:14,696
But baseball...

1498
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:16,257
has marked the time.

1499
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,204
This field, this game.

1500
01:25:20,273 --> 01:25:24,209
It's a part
of our past, Ray.

1501
01:25:24,277 --> 01:25:28,373
It reminds us
of all that once was good,

1502
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,212
and it could be again.

1503
01:25:31,284 --> 01:25:33,218
Oh,

1504
01:25:33,286 --> 01:25:35,447
people will come, Ray.

1505
01:25:36,723 --> 01:25:38,748
People will
most definitely come.

1506
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,727
Ray,

1507
01:25:41,794 --> 01:25:43,227
you will lose everything.

1508
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,696
You will be evicted.

1509
01:25:56,743 --> 01:25:58,108
Come on, Ray.

1510
01:26:18,865 --> 01:26:20,389
I'm not signing.

1511
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:21,296
[Sighs]

1512
01:26:21,367 --> 01:26:23,699
You're crazy!
Absolutely nuts!

1513
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:25,704
I can't do it, pal.

1514
01:26:25,772 --> 01:26:27,240
I mean, you build
a baseball field

1515
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,400
I mean, you build
a baseball field

1516
01:26:28,474 --> 01:26:30,339
in the middle of nowhere,

1517
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:31,968
and you stare at nothing.

1518
01:26:32,045 --> 01:26:33,342
It's not nothing.

1519
01:26:33,413 --> 01:26:35,347
Your daughter's
turned into a space case.

1520
01:26:35,415 --> 01:26:36,905
Get your hands off her!

1521
01:26:38,851 --> 01:26:39,875
Karin?

1522
01:26:45,124 --> 01:26:46,557
Is she all right?

1523
01:26:46,626 --> 01:26:48,059
Is she breathing?

1524
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:50,118
Should I get the car?

1525
01:26:54,567 --> 01:26:56,330
I'm going to call Emergency.

1526
01:26:58,271 --> 01:27:00,205
Annie, wait.

1527
01:27:00,273 --> 01:27:01,501
What?

1528
01:27:18,224 --> 01:27:20,055
Just wait.

1529
01:27:38,077 --> 01:27:40,011
What have we got here?

1530
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:42,104
She fell.

1531
01:27:48,788 --> 01:27:50,722
This child's choking to death.

1532
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:52,348
Get her up.

1533
01:27:52,425 --> 01:27:53,949
Hold her steady now.

1534
01:27:54,961 --> 01:27:55,950
[Cough]

1535
01:27:57,764 --> 01:27:59,254
[Coughing]

1536
01:28:00,433 --> 01:28:02,867
Hot dog.
Stuck in her throat.

1537
01:28:02,935 --> 01:28:04,368
She'll be all right.

1538
01:28:04,437 --> 01:28:07,964
She'll be turning handsprings
before you know it.

1539
01:28:12,445 --> 01:28:14,242
Thank you, Doc.

1540
01:28:15,448 --> 01:28:17,211
No, son.

1541
01:28:17,283 --> 01:28:18,875
Thank you.

1542
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,055
Oh, my God.
You can't go back.

1543
01:28:24,123 --> 01:28:25,556
Hey, it's all right.

1544
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:26,557
I'm sorry.

1545
01:28:26,626 --> 01:28:28,116
It's all right.

1546
01:28:32,398 --> 01:28:34,832
I best be getting on home

1547
01:28:34,901 --> 01:28:38,393
before Alicia begins to think
I got a girlfriend.

1548
01:28:43,409 --> 01:28:45,343
Hey, Doc.

1549
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:46,901
Good work, Doc.

1550
01:28:48,681 --> 01:28:50,239
Nice going, Doc.

1551
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,581
Going to miss you, Doc.

1552
01:28:57,256 --> 01:29:00,692
Win one for me one day,
will you, boys?

1553
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,692
OK, Doc.

1554
01:29:01,761 --> 01:29:02,921
Yeah.

1555
01:29:09,936 --> 01:29:12,928
When did these ballplayers
get here?

1556
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:19,502
Hey, rookie!

1557
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:33,358
You were good.

1558
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:48,873
Do not sell this farm, Ray.

1559
01:29:48,941 --> 01:29:50,875
You got to keep this farm.

1560
01:29:50,943 --> 01:29:52,877
You've had a rough day.

1561
01:29:52,945 --> 01:29:55,880
Go inside and get something
cold to drink.

1562
01:29:55,948 --> 01:29:56,880
Yeah.

1563
01:29:56,949 --> 01:29:58,473
That's a good idea.

1564
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:01,242
Don't sell the farm, Ray.

1565
01:30:10,763 --> 01:30:12,230
Ray?

1566
01:30:12,298 --> 01:30:14,732
We're going to call it a day.

1567
01:30:14,801 --> 01:30:16,234
See you tomorrow.

1568
01:30:16,302 --> 01:30:18,031
OK.

1569
01:30:21,307 --> 01:30:24,299
Hey, do you want
to come with us?

1570
01:30:28,447 --> 01:30:29,846
You mean it?

1571
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:31,406
No, not you.

1572
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,151
Him.

1573
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:37,621
Him?

1574
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:39,123
Come with you?

1575
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:40,124
Out there.

1576
01:30:40,193 --> 01:30:41,626
What is out there?

1577
01:30:41,694 --> 01:30:43,355
Come and find out.

1578
01:30:43,429 --> 01:30:45,363
Wait a second.
Why him?

1579
01:30:45,431 --> 01:30:46,864
I built this field.

1580
01:30:46,933 --> 01:30:50,369
You wouldn't be here
if it weren't for me.

1581
01:30:50,436 --> 01:30:53,030
I want to know
what's out there.

1582
01:30:53,105 --> 01:30:55,403
But you're not invited.

1583
01:30:55,474 --> 01:30:58,910
Not invited?
What do you mean I'm not invited?

1584
01:30:58,978 --> 01:31:00,843
That's my corn out there.

1585
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:03,746
You guys are guests
in my corn.

1586
01:31:03,816 --> 01:31:06,751
I've done everything
I've been asked to do.

1587
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:10,255
I haven't once asked
what's in it for me.

1588
01:31:10,323 --> 01:31:11,756
What are you saying?

1589
01:31:11,824 --> 01:31:14,554
I'm saying,
"What's in it for me?"

1590
01:31:14,627 --> 01:31:17,061
Is that why you did this?

1591
01:31:17,129 --> 01:31:18,596
For you?

1592
01:31:23,336 --> 01:31:26,567
I think you'd better
stay here, Ray.

1593
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,467
Why?

1594
01:31:32,378 --> 01:31:34,812
There's a reason they chose me,

1595
01:31:34,881 --> 01:31:36,815
just as there's a reason

1596
01:31:36,883 --> 01:31:38,510
they chose this field.

1597
01:31:38,584 --> 01:31:41,280
I gave an interview.

1598
01:31:41,354 --> 01:31:43,288
What are you talking about?

1599
01:31:43,356 --> 01:31:45,290
The one about Ebbets Field,

1600
01:31:45,358 --> 01:31:49,351
the one that sent you
to Boston to find me.

1601
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,163
You lied to me.

1602
01:31:52,231 --> 01:31:54,665
You were kidnapping me
at the time.

1603
01:31:54,734 --> 01:31:55,666
You lied.

1604
01:31:55,735 --> 01:31:59,102
You said your finger
was a gun.

1605
01:31:59,171 --> 01:32:01,332
That's a good point.

1606
01:32:01,407 --> 01:32:02,567
Ray.

1607
01:32:04,911 --> 01:32:06,435
Ray.

1608
01:32:06,512 --> 01:32:08,446
Listen to me, Ray.

1609
01:32:08,514 --> 01:32:10,106
Listen to me.

1610
01:32:11,751 --> 01:32:13,685
There is something out there,

1611
01:32:13,753 --> 01:32:16,187
and if I have the courage

1612
01:32:16,255 --> 01:32:18,189
to go through with this,

1613
01:32:18,257 --> 01:32:20,589
what a story it'll make.

1614
01:32:21,694 --> 01:32:24,788
"Shoeless Joe Jackson
comes to lowa."

1615
01:32:32,438 --> 01:32:35,373
What? Are you going
to write about it?

1616
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:37,875
You bet I'll write about it.

1617
01:32:37,944 --> 01:32:40,208
You're going
to write about it.

1618
01:32:40,279 --> 01:32:41,837
That's what I do.

1619
01:32:45,451 --> 01:32:47,112
Good.

1620
01:32:50,289 --> 01:32:51,950
Good.

1621
01:33:01,467 --> 01:33:02,957
Honey?

1622
01:33:06,804 --> 01:33:09,671
Honey, where's he going?

1623
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:12,675
Terry's been invited
to go out with the others.

1624
01:33:12,743 --> 01:33:14,677
How are you feeling,
sweetheart?

1625
01:33:14,745 --> 01:33:15,677
Stupid.

1626
01:33:15,746 --> 01:33:17,179
You mean out?

1627
01:33:17,247 --> 01:33:19,238
Yeah.

1628
01:33:19,316 --> 01:33:20,578
Out.

1629
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:22,278
Far out.

1630
01:33:23,987 --> 01:33:26,512
I want a full description.

1631
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,649
Take care of this family.

1632
01:33:31,428 --> 01:33:33,020
Be careful.

1633
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:33,048
Bye.

1634
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:37,753
What?

1635
01:34:44,268 --> 01:34:47,294
What are you
grinning at, you ghost?

1636
01:34:47,371 --> 01:34:49,396
"If you build it...

1637
01:34:51,942 --> 01:34:53,432
he will come."

1638
01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:07,386
Oh, my God.

1639
01:35:07,457 --> 01:35:09,220
What? What is it?

1640
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:14,624
It's my father.

1641
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:21,631
"Ease his pain."

1642
01:35:22,973 --> 01:35:24,964
"Go the distance."

1643
01:35:27,978 --> 01:35:29,411
It was you.

1644
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:34,717
No, Ray.

1645
01:35:34,785 --> 01:35:36,275
It was you.

1646
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:05,407
My God. L...

1647
01:36:05,482 --> 01:36:07,916
I only saw him years later

1648
01:36:07,985 --> 01:36:10,920
when he was worn down by life.

1649
01:36:10,988 --> 01:36:12,512
Look at him.

1650
01:36:12,589 --> 01:36:16,025
He's got his whole life
in front of him,

1651
01:36:16,093 --> 01:36:19,494
and I'm not even
a glint in his eye.

1652
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,395
What do I say to him?

1653
01:36:27,471 --> 01:36:30,406
Why don't you introduce him
to his granddaughter?

1654
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:35,537
Hi.

1655
01:36:35,612 --> 01:36:37,011
Hi.

1656
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,514
I just wanted
to thank you folks

1657
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:41,551
for putting up this field,

1658
01:36:41,618 --> 01:36:43,552
letting us play here.

1659
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:45,611
I'm John Kinsella.

1660
01:36:47,624 --> 01:36:48,784
I'm Ray.

1661
01:36:50,293 --> 01:36:51,726
My wife Annie.

1662
01:36:51,795 --> 01:36:52,727
Hi.

1663
01:36:52,796 --> 01:36:54,730
This is
my daughter Karin.

1664
01:36:54,798 --> 01:36:56,789
Karin, this is my f...

1665
01:36:59,636 --> 01:37:01,126
This is John.

1666
01:37:02,305 --> 01:37:03,465
Hi, John.

1667
01:37:05,809 --> 01:37:07,299
Hiya, Karin.

1668
01:37:09,513 --> 01:37:12,914
Well, we're going
to let you two talk.

1669
01:37:12,983 --> 01:37:16,419
I mean, if all these people
are going to come,

1670
01:37:16,486 --> 01:37:20,422
we got a lot of work to do.

1671
01:37:20,490 --> 01:37:23,357
It was very nice meeting you.

1672
01:37:23,427 --> 01:37:25,122
Ma'am.

1673
01:37:26,329 --> 01:37:27,819
Come on, hon.

1674
01:37:42,612 --> 01:37:45,376
You catch a good game.

1675
01:37:45,449 --> 01:37:46,643
Thank you.

1676
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:51,083
It's so beautiful here.

1677
01:37:53,623 --> 01:37:54,783
For me...

1678
01:37:56,626 --> 01:38:00,118
Well, for me it's like
a dream come true.

1679
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:05,458
Can I ask you something?

1680
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:11,566
Is... ls this heaven?

1681
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:16,639
It's lowa.

1682
01:38:18,815 --> 01:38:20,749
Iowa?

1683
01:38:20,817 --> 01:38:21,977
Yeah.

1684
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:27,012
I could have sworn
it was heaven.

1685
01:38:35,932 --> 01:38:37,524
Is...

1686
01:38:37,601 --> 01:38:39,262
Is there a heaven?

1687
01:38:41,438 --> 01:38:42,769
Oh, yeah.

1688
01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:47,432
It's the place
dreams come true.

1689
01:38:57,854 --> 01:38:59,947
Ha ha ha ha!

1690
01:39:07,464 --> 01:39:09,159
Maybe this is heaven.

1691
01:39:14,137 --> 01:39:15,729
Well...

1692
01:39:15,805 --> 01:39:17,739
Good night, Ray.

1693
01:39:19,976 --> 01:39:21,466
Good night, John.

1694
01:39:31,621 --> 01:39:33,020

1695
01:39:33,089 --> 01:39:34,249
Dad?

1696
01:39:37,594 --> 01:39:39,585
You want to have a catch?

1697
01:39:42,265 --> 01:39:43,755
I'd like that.
