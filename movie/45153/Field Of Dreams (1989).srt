00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:39,805
<i>RAY: My father's name was
John Kinse/la.</i>

2
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,723
<i>It's an Irish name.</i>

3
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:44,309
<i>He was born
in North Dakota in 1896</i>

4
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,310
<i>and never saw a big city until he
came back from France in 1918.</i>

5
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:52,317
<i>Settling in Chicago,
he learned to live and die</i>

6
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,152
<i>with the White Sox.</i>

7
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:57,781
<i>Died a little when they
lost the 1919 World Series,</i>

8
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:02,782
<i>died a lot when eight White Sox were
accused of throwing that Series.</i>

9
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,915
<i>He played some in the minors,
but nothing came of it.</i>

10
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:11,336
<i>Moved to Brooklyn in '35,
married Mom in '38,</i>

11
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:14,089
<i>was already an old man
at the nava/ yards</i>

12
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,092
<i>when I was born in 1952.</i>

13
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:19,219
<i>My name's Ray Kinse/la.</i>

14
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,974
<i>Mom died when I was three, and I
suppose Dad did the best he could.</i>

15
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:28,061
<i>Instead of Mother Goose, I was put
to bed to stories of Babe Ruth,</i>

16
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:32,316
<i>Lou Gehrig, and the great
Shoeless Joe Jackson.</i>

17
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:36,236
<i>Dad was a Yankees fan then,
so I rooted for Brooklyn.</i>

18
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:41,199
<i>In '58, the Dodgers moved away, so we
had to find other reasons to fight.</i>

19
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,534
<i>We did.</i>

20
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,536
<i>When I chose a college,</i>

21
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:48,373
<i>I picked the farthest
from home I could find.</i>

22
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:52,961
<i>This drove him up the wall,
which, I suppose, was the point.</i>

23
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:57,007
<i>Official/y, my major was English,
but really, it was the '60s.</i>

24
00:02:57,008 --> 00:03:00,218
<i>I marched, I smoked some grass,</i>

25
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,014
<i>I tried to like sitar music,
and I met Annie.</i>

26
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,891
<i>The only thing we had in common</i>

27
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:10,812
<i>was that she came from Iowa,
and I'd once heard of/owa.</i>

28
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,981
<i>After graduation,
we moved to the Midwest</i>

29
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:15,942
<i>and stayed with her family
as long as we could,</i>

30
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:18,904
<i>almost a full afternoon.</i>

31
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:21,907
<i>Annie and I got married
in June of '74.</i>

32
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:24,409
<i>Dad died that fall.</i>

33
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,787
<i>A few years later,
Karin was born.</i>

34
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:29,748
<i>She smelled weird,
but we loved her anyway.</i>

35
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:34,749
<i>Then Annie got the crazy idea she
could talk me into buying a farm.</i>

36
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,381
<i>I'm 36 years old,
I love my family,</i>

37
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:41,593
<i>I love baseball, and I'm
about to become a farmer.</i>

38
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:44,429
<i>But until I heard the voice,</i>

39
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,430
<i>I'd never done a crazy thing
in my whole life.</i>

40
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:29,929
<i>MALE VOICE: /fyou build it,
he will come.</i>

41
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:52,493
<i>If you build it, he will come.</i>

42
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:01,506
Hey, Annie!

43
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,383
Annie, what was that?

44
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:06,386
What was what?

45
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:11,387
That voice just now.
What was it?

46
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:17,268
We didn't hear anything.

47
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:22,486
All right.

48
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:27,487
<i>MALE VOICE: /fyou build it,
he will come.</i>

49
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,455
Okay, you must have heard that!

50
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:37,292
Sorry. Hey,
come on in to dinner.

51
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:42,293
Let's go, pumpkin.

52
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:01,191
Is there, like,
a sound truck on the highway?

53
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:05,195
Nope. Hey, Karin,
dinner's ready!

54
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:06,488
Kids with a radio?

55
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,573
Nope.

56
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:11,159
Hey, are you really
hearing voices?

57
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,578
Just one.

58
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,581
What did it say?

59
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:21,582
"If you build it,
he will come."

60
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:24,589
If you build what,
who will come?

61
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,925
He didn't say.

62
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,510
I hate it when that happens.

63
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:29,055
Me, too.

64
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:49,527
<i>MALE VOICE: /fyou build it,
he will come.</i>

65
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:05,088
Build what? What is this?

66
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:05,589
Ray?

67
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,760
It's okay, honey. I... I'm
just talking to the cornfield.

68
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:21,146
<i>Anyway, I was walking down
along the street,</i>

69
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:24,149
<i>and I heard this voice saying,</i>

70
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,192
<i>"Good evening, Mr. Dowd."</i>

71
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:28,778
<i>Well, I turned around,</i>

72
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:33,779
<i>and here was this big, six-foot rabbit
leaning up against the lamppost.</i>

73
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,664
Why did you do that?
It was funny.

74
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:42,000
Trust me, Karin.
It's not funny.

75
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:44,461
The man is sick. Very sick.

76
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,838
Karin, honey,
get your book bag. Let's go!

77
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,090
Hon, I'll take her today.

78
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:51,343
I've got errands to do in town.

79
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:51,844
Farout.

80
00:07:56,432 --> 00:08:00,810
Hey. What if the voice calls
while you're gone?

81
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,520
Take a message.

82
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:03,647
ANNIE: (CHUCKLING) Bye.

83
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,940
Bye.

84
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:08,276
Bye.

85
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:11,237
In all those years,
did you ever...

86
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:14,699
It's just I've heard that
sometimes farmers in the field...

87
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,452
They hear things.
You know, voices.

88
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:18,536
You hearing voices?

89
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:21,831
No. It's just I heard
some farmers do.

90
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:26,832
I, of course, don't, so I was wondering
if I was doing something wrong.

91
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,007
Did you... Did you ever hear
voices out there?

92
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,384
Who's hearing voices?

93
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:33,760
Ray is.

94
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:36,137
Out in the fields. No, I'm not.

95
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:37,472
I'm...

96
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,224
(CRAZY PLAYING ON STEREO)

(RAY LAUGHING)

98
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:45,480
Noises. That darned tractor...

99
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:49,484
I'm just going to get some 3-in-1 oil.
That ought to do it.

100
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:54,485
Itwas nice...
Nice talking to you.

101
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:23,601
<i>MALE VOICE: /fyou build it,
he will come.</i>

102
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:28,064
All right, that's it!
Huh? Who the...

103
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:30,525
Who are you, huh?
What do you want from me?

104
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:31,860
Son of a...

105
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:36,861
<i>MALE VOICE: /fyou build it,
he will come.</i>

106
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:41,866
If you build it...

107
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:52,585
If you build it,

108
00:09:56,177 --> 00:10:01,177
he will come.

109
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:29,834
ANNIE: You don't suppose this is
like an acid flashback, do you?

110
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:31,169
I never took acid.

111
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,173
Maybe you will someday.
It's like a flash-forward.

112
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,966
Annie, there's more.

113
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:40,428
Honey, why don't you eat
a little bit?

114
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:45,016
I... I think I know what "If you
build it, he will come" means.

115
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:48,520
Why do I not think
this is so good?

116
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:53,441
I think it means that if I build
a baseball field out there,

117
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:58,442
Shoeless Joe Jackson will get to
come back and play ball again.

118
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:01,449
You're kidding?

119
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,160
Uh-uh.

120
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:05,787
ANNIE: Wow.

121
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:08,123
Yeah.

122
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:12,669
You're kidding.

123
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,382
Boy, I thought my family was crazy,
but this is the craziest thing ever.

124
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:20,510
I know. It's totally nuts.
I mean, Shoeless Joe!

125
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,221
He's dead. Died in '51.
He's dead.

126
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,056
They suspended him, right?

127
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:26,224
Right.

128
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:27,725
He's still dead?

129
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:32,726
As far as I know.

130
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:37,318
RAY: Did you know
Babe Ruth copied his swing?

131
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,319
If I did, I've forgotten it.

132
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:48,872
He was supposed to be
so graceful and agile.

133
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:51,875
I'd actually like
to see him play again,

134
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,295
to let him play,
to right an old wrong.

135
00:11:55,296 --> 00:12:00,296
Wait. Wait a minute, Bosco.

136
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:03,887
Are you actually thinking
of doing this?

137
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:06,139
No.

138
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,140
I mean, I can't think of one
good reason why I should, but...

139
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:21,821
I'm 36. I have a wife,
a child, and a mortgage,

140
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:26,242
and I'm scared to death
I'm turning into my father.

141
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:30,246
What's your father got
to do with all of this?

142
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:35,247
I never forgave him
for getting old.

143
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:40,794
By the time he was as old
as I am now, he was ancient.

144
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,010
I mean, he must have had dreams, but
he never did anything about them.

145
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:52,435
For all I know, he may have
even heard voices, too,

146
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:56,814
but he sure didn't listen
to them.

147
00:12:56,815 --> 00:13:01,815
The man never did one spontaneous
thing in all the years I knew him.

148
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:07,116
Annie, I'm afraid
of that happening to me,

149
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:12,117
and something tells me this may be my
last chance to do something about it.

150
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:19,712
I want to build that field.

151
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,131
Do you think I'm crazy?

152
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:22,632
Yes.

153
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:33,013
But I also think if you really
feel you should do this,

154
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,020
then you should do it.

155
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,705
What the hell is he doing?

156
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,957
He's plowing under his corn.

157
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:56,458
Why?

158
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:06,926
Ty Cobb called him the greatest
left fielder of all time.

159
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:11,639
He said his glove was the place
where triples go to die.

160
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,599
<i>KAR/N: Could he hit?
RA Y: Could he hit?</i>

161
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,894
<i>Lifetime average .356,
third highest in history.</i>

162
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:19,397
<i>KAR/N: Why'd they call him
Shoeless Joe?</i>

163
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:20,982
<i>RA Y: When he was still
in the minors,</i>

164
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:23,901
<i>he bought a new pair of spikes
and hurt his feet.</i>

165
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:27,864
<i>In the sixth inning, he took them
off and played in his socks.</i>

166
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:29,282
<i>The players kidded him,</i>

167
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:33,161
<i>called him "Shoeless Joe,"
and the name stuck.</i>

168
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:34,787
MAN: He's going
to lose his farm.

169
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,331
WOMAN: Damned fool.

170
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:39,584
<i>RAY: Then in 1919, his team,
the Chicago White Sox,</i>

171
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:42,045
<i>they threw the World Series.</i>

172
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,421
<i>KAR/N: What's "threw"?</i>

173
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:45,673
<i>RA Y: Lt means
they lost on purpose.</i>

174
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:50,303
<i>Gamblers paid them to.
Except Shoeless Joe.</i>

175
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,763
<i>He did take their money,</i>

176
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:56,764
<i>but nobody ever proved he did
one thing to lose those games.</i>

177
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,686
If he threw it,

178
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:03,232
how do you explain he hit .375 for
the Series and committed no errors?

179
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,442
I can't.

180
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:07,195
Twelve hits including
the Series' only home run,

181
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:09,447
and they said
he's trying to lose?

182
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,366
It's ridiculous.

183
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,285
<i>RA Y: The commissioner of baseball
suspended eight of the players,</i>

184
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:17,580
<i>including the great Shoeless
Joe Jackson, for life.</i>

185
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:20,375
<i>KAR/N: What's "suspend"?</i>

186
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:25,376
<i>RA Y: Lt means they never
let him play the game again.</i>

187
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:28,383
My father said
he saw him years later

188
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:32,970
playing under a made-up name in
some 10th-rate league in Carolina.

189
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:36,391
He'd put on 50 pounds, and his
spring was gone from his step

190
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:39,310
but he could still hit.

191
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:44,232
Dad used to say nobody could
hit like Shoeless Joe.

192
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,859
I think that's the first time
I've ever seen you smile

193
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,860
when you mentioned your father.

194
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:54,117
Well...

195
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:08,335
I have just created something
totally illogical.

196
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,012
That's what I like about it.

197
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:19,600
Am I completely nuts?

198
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,353
Not completely.

199
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:25,815
It's a good baseball field,
Ray.

200
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,859
It's kind of pretty, isn't it?

201
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,404
Mmm-hmm.

202
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:55,553
Any sign?

203
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:58,723
Something's going to happen
out there.

204
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:03,724
I can feel it.

205
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,873
<i>ANNOUNCER ON TV: So, for the veteran
southpaw, his summer of woes continues.</i>

206
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:26,000
<i>That's four straight hits
in the inning.</i>

207
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:31,001
Daddy, what's a "southpaw"?

208
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:35,635
It means
a left-handed pitcher, honey.

209
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,845
So how bad is it?

210
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:42,350
Well, considering how much
less acreage we have for corn,

211
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:45,269
I say we'll probably

212
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,270
almost break even.

213
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,737
We used up all our savings
on that field, Ray.

214
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:55,947
Daddy?

215
00:17:55,948 --> 00:18:00,948
Justa minute, Karin.

216
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,120
So what are you saying?
We can't keep the field?

217
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Makes it real hard
to keep the farm.

218
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,300
Daddy.

219
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,761
In a minute, Karin!

220
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:23,762
There's a man out there
on your lawn.

221
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll put up some coffee.
Why don't you go on outside?

222
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:10,808
Sorry.

223
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:20,021
I'll get some out there.

224
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:51,015
Hi.

225
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:54,351
Ray Kinsella.

226
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:59,352
Joe Jackson.

227
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:28,965
I bet it's good
to be playing again, huh?

228
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:37,770
Getting thrown out of baseball

229
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:42,650
was like having
part of me amputated.

230
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:43,984
I've heard that old men wake up

231
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:48,985
and scratch itchy legs that have
been dust for over 50 years.

232
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:53,118
That was me.

233
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,330
I'd wake up at night

234
00:22:56,331 --> 00:23:00,042
with the smell of the ballpark
in my nose,

235
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:05,043
with the cool of the grass
on my feet,

236
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:10,465
the thrill of the grass.

237
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:18,477
Can you pitch?

238
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:21,438
Yeah,

239
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:21,939
notbad.

240
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:40,374
Don't we need a catcher?

241
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:44,461
Not if you get it
near the plate.

242
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:44,962
Right.

243
00:23:58,143 --> 00:24:03,143
I'm pitching
to Shoeless Joe Jackson.

244
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:10,517
Nice hit.

245
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:31,338
See if you can hit my curve.

246
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:40,893
You can hit the curve ball.

247
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:44,104
Put one right here, huh?

248
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:44,605
Right.

249
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:01,705
Right,
you're a low ball hitter.

250
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:06,543
Man, I did love this game.

251
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:09,880
I'd have played for food money.

252
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:12,049
It was the game,

253
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,178
the sounds, the smells.

254
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:21,179
Did you ever hold a ball
or a glove to your face?

255
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,435
Yeah.

256
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:28,436
I used to love traveling on
the trains from town to town.

257
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,610
The hotels,

258
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:36,611
brass spittoons in the lobbies,
brass beds in the rooms.

259
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:43,247
It was the crowd,

260
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:48,248
rising to their feet
when the ball was hit deep.

261
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:54,258
Shoot

262
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,259
I'd have played for nothing.

263
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:08,685
It's my family.

264
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,566
What's with the lights?

265
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:14,111
Oh, all the stadiums
have them now.

266
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:15,863
Even Wrigley Field.

267
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:17,948
It's harder to see the ball.

268
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:21,994
The owners found that more
people can attend night games.

269
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:22,495
Owners.

270
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:41,305
Mr. Jackson, this is my wife
Annie and my daughter Karin.

271
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:44,558
Ma'am. Hi.

272
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,727
Are you a ghost?

273
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:48,896
Karin.

274
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:50,147
She's kidding.

275
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:52,608
That's okay.

276
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,777
What do you think?

277
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,904
You look real to me.

278
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:59,364
Then I guess I'm real.

279
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:02,868
Would you like to come inside?

280
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:07,869
Thanks. I don't think I can.

281
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:16,673
Can I come back again?

282
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:21,674
Yeah. I built this for you.

283
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,102
There are others, you know.

284
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:32,022
There were eight of us. It would
really mean a lot to them.

285
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:37,023
Yeah, anytime.
They're all welcome here.

286
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:50,541
Hey, is this heaven?

287
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,961
No.

288
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:58,962
It's Iowa.

289
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:04,138
Where's he going?

290
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:09,139
I don't know.

291
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:21,071
We're keeping this field.

292
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:24,408
You bet your ass we are.

293
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,910
You're going to lose
yourfarm, pal.

294
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:29,413
How can you lose
something so big?

295
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:33,417
He misplaced the house once.
Yeah, but it turned up.

296
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,919
Ray, come on. Ray? Ray?

297
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,047
This stupid baseball field's
going to bankrupt you.

298
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:43,051
If you default on your loan,
you're going to lose everything.

299
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:46,221
My partners will give you
a fair price.

300
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:48,432
Thanks, Mark.
Thanks, Mark, but no.

301
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,017
No.

302
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:52,561
What are you holding
onto this place for?

303
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,479
You never liked Iowa.

304
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,981
That's not true.

305
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:59,234
You don't know
the first thing about farming.

306
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:02,905
I know a lot about farming.
More than you think.

307
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:07,117
Well, then how could you plow
under your major crop?

308
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:10,871
What's a crop?

309
00:29:10,872 --> 00:29:14,458
ANNIE: Come on. That is funny.
What's a crop?

310
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:17,419
Daddy, the baseball game is on.

311
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,797
Excuse us.

312
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,798
Excuse us.

313
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:29,014
Annie, I don't believe
this guy.

314
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:32,768
I'm trying to bail him out, and
he leaves to watch television.

315
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:37,769
He used to be normal. Yeah.

316
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:54,827
(LAUGHING)

317
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:12,224
Buck!

318
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:14,643
ALL: Whoa!

319
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:19,644
MAN: All right.

320
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,610
Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!

321
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:27,072
All right! Home base!

322
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:29,199
Watch Joe's feet.

323
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,704
A good left fielder
knows what pitch is coming.

324
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:37,624
He can tell from the bat's angle
which way the ball's heading.

325
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,544
(ALL CHEERING)

326
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:42,045
Show off!

327
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,797
Stick it in your ear, Gandil.

328
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,798
If you'd have run like that against
Detroit, I'd have won 20 games!

329
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:52,347
For Pete's sakes, Cicotte,
that was 68 years ago.

330
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:53,765
Give it up!

331
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:58,395
Hey! You guys want
to play ball or what?

332
00:30:58,396 --> 00:30:59,896
Muscle-bound jerk.

333
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:01,857
At least I got muscles.

334
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,151
At most you got muscles.

335
00:31:04,152 --> 00:31:06,528
Come on, asshole! Pitch!

336
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:11,529
Weaver, be nice.

337
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:14,202
Sorry, kid!

338
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:16,747
It's okay. I don't mind.

339
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:18,623
ALL: All right, Karin.

340
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:23,624
Hey, hey, heV!

341
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:36,058
Ray? Honey, Mom
and everybody's leaving now.

342
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,393
Okay.

343
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:40,812
Oh, well, itwas... You know.

344
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:44,316
Thanks for coming.

345
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:47,194
Ray, think about what I said.
I'm just trying to help.

346
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:48,737
I know.

347
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:51,823
Thought you two were watching
some game.

348
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:56,824
It's not really a game.
It's more like practice.

349
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:04,457
There's only eight of them.
They can't play a real game.

350
00:32:05,963 --> 00:32:08,924
Eight of what?

351
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:09,425
Them.

352
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:15,680
Who them? Them them.

353
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:17,808
RAY: You don't see them?

354
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:20,143
Karin, honey,
what are you watching?

355
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:22,729
The baseball men.

356
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,650
MARK: Baseball men?

357
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,985
Do you see
the baseball men right now?

358
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:32,656
Of course I do.

359
00:32:32,657 --> 00:32:35,951
What, you really
don't see them?

360
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:40,831
It's not very polite to try to
make other people feel stupid.

361
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:44,709
Mom, wait a minute.
Mom! Wait a minute.

362
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,587
Dee. Dee, wait.
You don't see these people?

363
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:52,588
It's not funny, Annie.

364
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:06,606
They couldn't see it.

365
00:33:06,607 --> 00:33:11,607
This is really interesting.

366
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,614
Hey, Ray, look at this.

367
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:18,952
Sixty-eight years since I wore this
uniform, still fits me like a glove.

368
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:22,205
You must keep
in pretty good shape.

369
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:24,374
Now let's see, I died in '70.

370
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:28,670
That means I haven't had
a cigarette in 18 years.

371
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:29,921
You don't smoke, do you?

372
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:31,047
No.

373
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:35,552
Karin! Ray! Dinner!

374
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:38,430
"Ray, dinner." "Dinner, Ray."

375
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:40,223
All right, all right.

376
00:33:40,224 --> 00:33:42,642
Come on. Let's hit the showers.

377
00:33:42,643 --> 00:33:47,643
See you later.

378
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:54,275
See you, QUVS-

379
00:33:57,408 --> 00:34:01,161
<i>I'm me/ting! I'm me/ting!</i>

380
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:04,581
<i>MAN: Come on, you knucklehead.</i>

381
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:09,582
That is so cool.

382
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:13,965
<i>MALE VO/CE: Ease his pain.</i>

383
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:16,718
What?

384
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,263
I'm sorry. What?
I didn't understand. What?

385
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:23,391
<i>MALE VO/CE: Ease his pain.</i>

386
00:34:23,392 --> 00:34:25,810
Ease his pain. What...

387
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:29,189
What the hell does that mean,
ease his pain?

388
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,190
What pain? All right.
Whose pain?

389
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:42,327
Thanks a lot.

390
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:47,328
Thanks a lot.

391
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:54,631
Come on, honey, wash up. We got
the PTA meeting after dinner.

392
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:58,009
Talking about banning books
again, really subversive books,

393
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,638
<i>like The Wizard of Oz,
Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

394
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,056
What happened to you?

395
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,558
The voice is back.

396
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,520
You don't have to build
a football field, do you?

397
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:10,730
He said, "Ease his pain."

398
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:12,440
Ease whose pain?

399
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:14,484
I asked him. He wouldn't say.

400
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:15,652
Shoeless Joe's?

401
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:17,946
I don't think so.

402
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:19,573
One of the other players?

403
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:20,740
I don't think so.

404
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:25,741
This is a very nonspecific voice out
there, and he's starting to piss me off.

405
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:31,293
I was having a fun day today,
a good day.

406
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:36,294
Want a fry?

407
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,553
<i>And I say,
smut and fi/th like this has</i>

408
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:46,554
<i>no place in our schools.</i>

409
00:35:48,477 --> 00:35:51,187
Fascist.
I'd like to ease her pain.

410
00:35:51,188 --> 00:35:53,648
<i>Mrs. Kessinik, Mrs. Kessinik.</i>

411
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:56,693
<i>That book you're waving about
is hardly smut.</i>

412
00:35:56,694 --> 00:36:01,197
<i>It's considered by many critics to be
the classic novel about the 19603.</i>

413
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:02,699
It's pornography!

414
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,827
<i>No, no. The Supreme Court says
it's not.</i>

415
00:36:05,828 --> 00:36:08,955
<i>And it's author, Mr. Mann...
Is sick!</i>

416
00:36:08,956 --> 00:36:11,625
<i>Terence Mann is
a Pulitzer Prize winner.</i>

417
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:15,211
<i>He's widely regarded as the
finest satirist of his time.</i>

418
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:17,380
He's a pervert!

419
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:19,716
Probably a Communist, too!

420
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:21,843
What planet are
these people from?

421
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:25,889
<i>Mr. Harris, the so-ca/led
novels of Terence Mann</i>

422
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,933
<i>endorse promiscuity,
godlessness,</i>

423
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:31,561
<i>the mongre/ization
of the races,</i>

424
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:36,562
<i>and disrespect to high-ranking
officers of the United States Army.</i>

425
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:41,071
<i>And that's why right-thinking school
boards all across the country</i>

426
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:44,407
<i>having been banning
this man's S-H-l-T</i>

427
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:48,828
<i>since 1969.</i>

428
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:53,829
Terence Mann?

429
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,710
<i>You know why he stopped writing books.
Because he masturbates.</i>

430
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:04,469
Excuse me, madam.

431
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,931
Excuse me.

432
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:11,559
Terence Mann was a warm,
gentle voice of reason

433
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,271
during a time of great madness.

434
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:19,401
He coined the phrase,
"Make love, not war."

435
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:21,778
While other people were
chanting, "Burn, baby, burn,"

436
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:25,782
he was talking about love
and peace and understanding.

437
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:30,783
I cherished his books, and I
dearly wish he had written more.

438
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:35,955
Maybe if you had experienced
even a little bit of the '60s,

439
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,255
you might feel
the same way, too.

440
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:43,800
I experienced the '60s.

441
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:48,138
No, you had two '50s and moved
right on into the '70s.

442
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,889
Annie, look at this.

443
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,890
Your husband plowed under his
corn and built a baseball field.

444
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:59,774
Now, there's
an intelligent response.

445
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,736
The weirdo.

446
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:06,990
Annie... Honey, it's all right.
I'll be cool.

447
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:11,991
At least he is not
a book burner, you Nazi cow.

448
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:17,876
At least I'm not married to the biggest
horse's ass in three counties.

449
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:21,337
All right, Beulah,
do you want to step outside?

450
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:23,006
Fine!

451
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:25,008
RAY: Annie.

452
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:27,761
All right, honey.
I've got a better idea.

453
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:32,056
Let's take a vote.
Who's for Eva Braun?

454
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:34,642
Who wants to burn books?

455
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:39,643
Who wants to spit on the Constitution of
the United States of America? Anybody?

456
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:49,199
All right. Now,
who's for the Bill of Rights?

457
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,578
Who thinks freedom
is a pretty darn good thing?

458
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:58,579
Come on! Come on!
Let's see those hands!

459
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:02,962
Who thinks we have to stand
up to the kind of censorship

460
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:07,963
they had under Stalin?

461
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:24,567
All right. There you go. America, I love you.
I'm proud of you.

462
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:26,611
Let's go. We got to go.

463
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:29,030
This is great!

464
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:31,574
RAY: I figured it out.
I figured it out.

465
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:32,951
(WHOOPING)

466
00:39:32,952 --> 00:39:34,869
Was that great, or what?
I figured it out.

467
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,831
It's just like the '60s again!
I just figured it out.

468
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:39,916
"Step outside, you Nazi cow."

469
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:41,960
I know whose pain
I'm supposed to ease.

470
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:44,420
What? I know whose pain
I'm supposed to ease.

471
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:47,674
I just halted the spread
of neofascism in America...

472
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:49,843
Terence Mann. What about him?

473
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,262
That's whose pain. You sure?

474
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:55,807
I was right about building
the field, wasn't I?

475
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:57,559
Well, what's his pain?
I don't know.

476
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,477
How are you supposed to ease it?
I don't know.

477
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:01,521
Ray. Well, Ann...

478
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:04,607
Look, he's my favorite writer,
too,

479
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:09,608
but what's Terence Mann
got to do with baseball?

480
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,724
Annie, it's incredible.
By the early '70s,

481
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:40,351
Mann decides people have
become either too extremist

482
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:42,228
or too apathetic to listen.

483
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:45,315
So he stops writing books,

484
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:48,318
he starts writing poetry
about whales,

485
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,821
and then he starts fooling
around with a computer.

486
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:53,615
Know what he does now?

487
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:56,117
He writes software for
interactive children's videos.

488
00:40:56,118 --> 00:41:00,496
They teach kids how to resolve
their conflicts peacefully.

489
00:41:00,497 --> 00:41:02,373
God, what an amazing guy.

490
00:41:02,374 --> 00:41:04,292
What's that got to do
with baseball?

491
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:06,461
In the April 1962 issue
of Jet Magazine,

492
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:09,631
there's a story called
"This Is Not A Kite."

493
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,466
It's not his best work,

494
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:14,844
but the story's hero

495
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:17,263
is named John Kinsella,
my father.

496
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:18,431
Wow.

497
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:20,183
What do you mean, "Wow"?

498
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:24,354
Big wow! What's it got to do
with baseball?

499
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:29,355
You drive.

500
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:34,197
Okay, the last interview
he ever gave was in 1973.

501
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:35,531
Guess what it's about.

502
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,158
Some kind of team sport.

503
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:40,328
Mann was a baseball fanatic.
Listen to this.

504
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:44,123
"My earliest recurring dream
was to play at Ebbets Field"

505
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:46,584
"with Jackie Robinson
and the Brooklyn Dodgers."

506
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:49,212
Wtneverhappened.
The Dodgers left Brooklyn.

507
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:54,050
"Ebbets Field is gone,
but I still dream that dream."

508
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:57,887
That's sad.

509
00:41:57,888 --> 00:42:01,724
RAY: The man wrote the best
books of his generation.

510
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:05,478
He was a pioneer in the civil
rights and the antiwar movement.

511
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,605
I mean, he made
the cover of Newsweek.

512
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:11,693
He knew everybody. He did everything.
He helped shape his time.

513
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:13,987
The guy hung out
with the Beatles.

514
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:17,073
It wasn't enough.
What he missed was baseball.

515
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:18,741
Oh, my God! What?

516
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:21,911
"As a small boy,
he had a bat named Rosebud."

517
00:42:21,912 --> 00:42:24,080
Give me that. Sorry.

518
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:28,334
The guy hasn't been
to a baseball game since 1958.

519
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:32,171
So, in order to ease his pain, you're
supposed to take him to a ballgame.

520
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:34,632
Yes.

521
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:37,468
Ray, this is nuttier than
building the baseball field.

522
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:38,761
No. No, it's not.

523
00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:42,849
It's pretty weird, but building
the field was 5, 10% weirder.

524
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,643
I'm going to have
to nip this one in the bud.

525
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:49,063
We're having moderate-to-heavy
financial difficulties here.

526
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:52,442
And you can't take off for Boston
while we're going broke in Iowa.

527
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:54,777
This is really
new territory for us,

528
00:42:54,778 --> 00:42:57,447
but we're dealing
with primal forces of nature.

529
00:42:57,448 --> 00:43:01,617
The prudent thing is not
to quibble over details.

530
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:06,122
Yeah, but why do you have to go? Why
can't the voice send somebody else?

531
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:09,250
How about Shirley MacLaine?
Is she too busy?

532
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:11,335
What does this have
to do with you?

533
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:13,629
RAY: That's what I have
to find out.

534
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,800
Ray, we are behind on the mortgage.
That field ate up all of our savings.

535
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:19,385
We could lose this farm.

536
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:23,097
I won't even stay in motels. I'll
sleep in the car. I'll beg for food.

537
00:43:23,098 --> 00:43:27,769
No. No! Now, this is too much!

538
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,898
Now, look. I understand your need to
prove to yourself and to the world

539
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:34,400
you are not turning into your
father, but you've done it.

540
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:37,820
You believed in the magic. Ithappened.
Isn't that enough?

541
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:41,449
It's more than that.
I know this is totally nuts,

542
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,826
but there's another reason
I'm supposed to do it.

543
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:47,163
I feel it as strongly
as I've felt anything.

544
00:43:47,164 --> 00:43:48,289
There's a reason.

545
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,000
What? Just tell me what it is.

546
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:52,835
Something's going to happen
at the game.

547
00:43:52,836 --> 00:43:55,254
There's something
at Fenway Park.

548
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:59,634
I got to be there with
Terence Mann to find it out.

549
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:04,180
Is Fenway the one with the big
green wall in left field?

550
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:07,183
Yeah.

551
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:11,604
I dreamt last night you were
at Fenway with Terence Mann.

552
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:14,357
Was I sitting on the
first base side? Yes.

553
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:16,234
About halfway up on the aisle?

554
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:19,028
Yeah. Eating a hot dog.
Eating a hot dog.

555
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:20,988
I had the same dream.

556
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:25,989
I'll help you pack.

557
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:50,810
RAY: Hi, I'm...

558
00:44:50,811 --> 00:44:52,728
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.

559
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:54,397
Hi. No.

560
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:55,815
Hi.

561
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:59,277
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella. It's a great
pleasure to finally get to...

562
00:44:59,278 --> 00:45:02,405
Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.
I'm a big fan of yours.

563
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:04,782
Hi.

564
00:45:04,783 --> 00:45:06,742
Hi.

565
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:08,870
How do you do, Mr. Mann?

566
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:12,248
I have to take you to a base...

567
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:16,252
All right, stupid, put your
hands up and get in the trunk.

568
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:20,089
Good. Good.

569
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,885
He lives right around here.
Do you know him?

570
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:27,597
He's sort of a tall black man.
I'm a friend of his.

571
00:45:27,598 --> 00:45:32,598
If he was much of a friend, he could
give you the directions himself.

572
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:39,150
That's a good point. Thank you.

573
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:42,737
I don't know where he lives.
Get away from me!

574
00:45:42,738 --> 00:45:45,239
I ain't going
to tell you nothing.

575
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,240
Go away! You're a pest!

576
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:54,123
Two blocks down,
right-hand side.

577
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:57,752
First door that don't have a
chicken in the window is his.

578
00:45:57,753 --> 00:46:02,753
No chicken.

579
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:49,341
Who the hell are you?

580
00:46:49,513 --> 00:46:54,513
Sir, my name's Ray Kinsella.

581
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:12,868
We got
a learning disability here?

582
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:14,787
If I could just have
one minute, please.

583
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:17,957
Look, I can't tell you
the secret of life,

584
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:20,543
and I don't have
any answers for you.

585
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:24,046
I don't give interviews, and
I'm no longer a public figure.

586
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:27,883
I just want to be left alone,
so piss off.

587
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:30,553
Wait! Wait!

588
00:47:30,554 --> 00:47:32,847
Look, I've come 1,500 miles
to see you

589
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:36,726
at the risk of losing my home
and alienating my wife.

590
00:47:36,727 --> 00:47:40,146
All I'm asking is one minute.

591
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:40,647
Please.

592
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:50,193
One minute.

593
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:59,749
Okay, I understand
your desire for privacy,

594
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,169
and lwouldn't dream of intruding if
this weren't extremely important.

595
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:07,423
Oh, God.
I don't do causes anymore.

596
00:48:07,424 --> 00:48:09,258
This isn't a cause.

597
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:11,510
I don't need money
or an endorsement.

598
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:13,262
Refreshing.

599
00:48:13,263 --> 00:48:14,555
You once wrote,

600
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:18,601
"There comes a time when all the cosmic
tumblers have clicked into place"

601
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:21,270
"and the universe opens
itself up for a few seconds"

602
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:24,023
"to show you what's possible."

603
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:26,442
Oh, my God!

604
00:48:26,443 --> 00:48:27,526
What?

605
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:29,195
You're from the '60s.

606
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:31,822
Well, yeah. Actually...

607
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:33,115
Out! Hey!

608
00:48:33,116 --> 00:48:34,825
Back to the '60s.

609
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:39,826
No place for you here in the future.
Get back while you still can!

610
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:44,335
You've changed, you know that?

611
00:48:44,336 --> 00:48:46,253
Yes, I suppose I have.

612
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:51,254
How about this? Peace, love, dope.
Now get the hell out of here!

613
00:49:34,386 --> 00:49:37,680
You've really pissed me off.

614
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:39,807
Hold it.

615
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:41,684
I was hoping I wouldn't have
to do it this way.

616
00:49:41,685 --> 00:49:43,686
What the hell is that?

617
00:49:43,687 --> 00:49:45,354
It's a gun.

618
00:49:45,355 --> 00:49:46,605
It's your finger.

619
00:49:46,606 --> 00:49:48,023
No, it's a gun.

620
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:49,525
Let me see it.

621
00:49:49,526 --> 00:49:51,902
I'm not going to show you
my gun.

622
00:49:51,903 --> 00:49:56,903
I'm not going to hurt you.
I need you to come with...

623
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:58,534
What are you doing?

624
00:49:58,535 --> 00:50:01,203
I'll beat you with a crowbar
until you go away.

625
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:03,622
Whoa! Wait! You can't do that.

626
00:50:03,623 --> 00:50:07,918
There are rules here? Oh, no.
There are no rules here.

627
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:12,919
You're a pacifist!

628
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:16,385
Shit.

629
00:50:16,386 --> 00:50:20,097
Thank you. Thank you.

630
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:24,393
So what? You kidnapping me?
What's the deal here?

631
00:50:24,394 --> 00:50:27,813
I was...

632
00:50:27,814 --> 00:50:30,733
I was hoping I could just
convince you to come with me.

633
00:50:30,734 --> 00:50:33,569
So you are kidnapping me?

634
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,072
I have to take you
to a baseball game.

635
00:50:37,073 --> 00:50:38,866
You what?

636
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:41,535
Tonight's game. Red Sox, A's.

637
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:44,497
Why?

638
00:50:44,498 --> 00:50:45,915
Something will happen there.

639
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:50,916
I don't know what, but we'll
find out when it does.

640
00:50:51,922 --> 00:50:53,255
My name's Ray Kinsella.

641
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:57,218
You used my father's name for a
character in one of your stories.

642
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:58,844
John Kinsella.

643
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:01,639
You're seeing a whole team
of psychiatrists, aren't you?

644
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,640
I don't blame you for thinking
that, but, no, I'm not.

645
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:11,023
I swear to God, I'm the least
crazy person I've ever known.

646
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:15,319
Why are you kidnapping me
to a baseball game?

647
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,612
Mayl...

648
00:51:16,613 --> 00:51:18,489
Oh, please.

649
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,074
Want a cup of coffee?

650
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:21,992
No.

651
00:51:21,993 --> 00:51:24,912
Want some cookies?

652
00:51:24,913 --> 00:51:28,082
No.

653
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:30,709
I read an interview you gave
a long time ago

654
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,254
about how you always dreamed
of playing at Ebbets Field

655
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:36,257
and how sad you felt
when they tore it down.

656
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:38,926
I never said that.

657
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:40,135
You didn't?

658
00:51:40,136 --> 00:51:45,136
I don't even recall
thinking that.

659
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:51,059
This is so weird.

660
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:54,316
This whole...

661
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:58,612
This whole thing is so weird.

662
00:51:58,613 --> 00:52:03,613
Then why go through with it?

663
00:52:03,868 --> 00:52:08,868
It's a long story.

664
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,501
But it's a really good story.

665
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:14,670
I'll tell you on the way.

666
00:52:14,671 --> 00:52:17,006
I'm not going to get rid
of you, am I?

667
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:22,007
Come to this game. I'll never
bother you again, noteven_.

668
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:27,095
Not even a Christmas card.

669
00:52:31,354 --> 00:52:33,105
<i>(ANNOUNCER SPEAKING ON PA)</i>

670
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:35,232
So what do you do
with yourself these days?

671
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:37,526
I live, I work.

672
00:52:37,527 --> 00:52:39,528
I learned how to cook.

673
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:43,616
I take walks and watch sunsets.

674
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:46,035
Don't you miss being involved?

675
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:49,663
I was the East Coast
distributor of involved.

676
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:52,541
Late it and drank it
and breathed it.

677
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:56,086
Then they killed
Martin and Bobby,

678
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:58,547
they elected Tricky Dick twice,

679
00:52:58,548 --> 00:53:00,382
and now people like you think

680
00:53:00,383 --> 00:53:02,593
I must be miserable because
I'm not involved anymore.

681
00:53:02,594 --> 00:53:04,970
I've got news for you.

682
00:53:04,971 --> 00:53:07,640
I spent all my misery
years ago.

683
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,892
I have no more pain left
for any of you.

684
00:53:09,893 --> 00:53:13,020
I gave at the office.

685
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:15,606
So what do you want?

686
00:53:15,607 --> 00:53:18,359
I want them to stop
looking to me for answers,

687
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,695
begging me to speak again,
write again, be a leader.

688
00:53:21,696 --> 00:53:24,198
I want them to start thinking
for themselves.

689
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:27,326
I want my privacy.

690
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:32,327
No, I meant what do you want?

691
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:37,419
Oh.

692
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,090
Dog and a beer.

693
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:42,549
Two.

694
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,677
10 bucks.

695
00:53:44,678 --> 00:53:46,595
Okay, I understand.

696
00:53:46,596 --> 00:53:49,098
You should be entitled to
as much privacy as you want,

697
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:52,017
but why stop writing?

698
00:53:52,018 --> 00:53:54,186
I haven't published a word
in 17 years,

699
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:57,106
and still I have to endure
lunatics like you.

700
00:53:57,107 --> 00:54:00,984
What do you think would happen if I
suddenly came out with a new book?

701
00:54:00,985 --> 00:54:05,985
They'd bleed me dry.

702
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,960
<i>MALE VO/CE: Go the distance.</i>

703
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:32,387
<i>Go the distance.</i>

704
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:54,534
What's the matter?

705
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:56,498
You didn't see that?

706
00:54:56,499 --> 00:54:57,111
See what?

707
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:06,884
I'm sorry. I guess
you didn't have to be here.

708
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:07,385
What?

709
00:55:11,347 --> 00:55:14,558
Whenever you want to go,
we can go.

710
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,559
Fine. Let's go.

711
00:56:02,607 --> 00:56:06,068
What is it
you're not telling me?

712
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:11,069
I've already taken up
too much of your time.

713
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,627
I wish I had your passion, Ray.

714
00:56:23,628 --> 00:56:27,297
Misdirected though it might
be, it is still a passion.

715
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:32,298
I used to feel that way
about things, but...

716
00:56:33,596 --> 00:56:35,848
You got another message,
didn't you?

717
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:37,307
You'll think I'm crazy.

718
00:56:37,308 --> 00:56:39,268
I already think you're crazy.

719
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:43,772
What did it say?

720
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:48,773
It said, "The man's done enough.
Leave him alone."

721
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:10,173
"Moonlight" Graham.

722
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:11,466
You saw it.

723
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:13,427
Saw what?

724
00:57:13,428 --> 00:57:16,513
You saw it.
New York Giants, 1922.

725
00:57:16,514 --> 00:57:19,057
He played one game.
He never got to bat.

726
00:57:19,058 --> 00:57:22,060
What did I see?
Chisholm, Minnesota.

727
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:25,772
We were the only ones who saw it.
Did you hear the voice, too?

728
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:30,773
It's what told me to find you.
Did you hear it?

729
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,781
"Go the distance"?

730
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:37,743
Yes. Do you know what it means?

731
00:57:37,744 --> 00:57:38,994
Yes.

732
00:57:38,995 --> 00:57:40,245
What?

733
00:57:40,246 --> 00:57:43,457
It means we're going to Minnesota
to find "Moonlight" Graham.

734
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,167
We're going... We?

735
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:46,919
I must be out of my mind.

736
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,338
What do we do when we find him?

737
00:57:49,339 --> 00:57:51,798
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

738
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:55,302
That's right.
You're right. You're right.

739
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:56,845
This is so bitching.

740
00:57:56,846 --> 00:58:01,846
I don't believe I'm doing this.

741
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:20,118
<i>RA Y: Hey, Annie, guess what?
I'm with Terence Mann.</i>

An old ballplayer.

00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,851

to me, okay?

755
00:58:51,067 --> 00:58:52,609
I'll try.

RAY: Half a dozen Grahams.

761
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,262
No Archibald. No "Moonlight."

762
00:59:20,263 --> 00:59:25,263
Follow me.

763
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:36,361
Hello.

764
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:38,363
Excuse me.
Maybe you can help us.

765
00:59:38,364 --> 00:59:41,783
We're looking for an ex-baseball
player named Archibald Graham.

766
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:43,201
Oh, you mean Doc Graham.

767
00:59:43,202 --> 00:59:45,787
No. I think
his nickname was "Moonlight."

768
00:59:45,788 --> 00:59:47,205
Well, that's Dr. Graham.

769
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:48,790
Dr. Graham?

770
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:51,126
His baseball career
never amounted to much.

771
00:59:51,127 --> 00:59:53,253
He went back to school.

772
00:59:53,254 --> 00:59:54,755
His father was a doctor.

773
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:56,298
Do you know
where we can find him?

774
00:59:56,299 --> 01:00:00,719
It's nothing bad.
We're not from the IRS.

775
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,637
Doc Graham is dead.

776
01:00:02,638 --> 01:00:07,638
He died in 1972.

777
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:09,811
"And there were times
when children could not afford"

778
01:00:09,812 --> 01:00:12,647
"eyeglasses or milk
or clothing."

779
01:00:12,648 --> 01:00:15,650
"Yet, no child was ever denied
these essentials"

780
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:19,071
"because, in the background,
there was always Dr. Graham."

781
01:00:19,072 --> 01:00:21,490
"Without any fanfare
or publicity,"

782
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:25,327
"the glasses or the milk
or the ticket to the ballgame"

783
01:00:25,328 --> 01:00:28,747
"found their way
into the child's pocket."

784
01:00:28,748 --> 01:00:30,999
You wrote that.

785
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,292
The day he died.

786
01:00:32,293 --> 01:00:33,794
Can I see that?

787
01:00:33,795 --> 01:00:35,545
You're a good writer.

788
01:00:35,546 --> 01:00:37,005
So are you.

789
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:42,006
(PHONE RINGING)

790
01:00:43,012 --> 01:00:46,556
Something's missing.

791
01:00:46,557 --> 01:00:50,602
Well, he sounds like
he was a wonderful man.

792
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:54,481
Half the towns in North
America have a Doc Graham.

793
01:00:54,482 --> 01:00:58,360
What makes this one so special we
travel across the country to find him

794
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:01,363
16 years after he died?

795
01:01:01,364 --> 01:01:06,364
There's got to be more.

796
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,956
What else?

797
01:01:10,957 --> 01:01:13,500
He always wore an overcoat,

798
01:01:13,501 --> 01:01:15,377
he had white hair,

799
01:01:15,378 --> 01:01:17,504
and he always carried
an umbrella.

800
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:19,047
What was the umbrella for?

801
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:22,634
It got to be a habit,
something to hang on to.

802
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:27,055
He said he used it to beat
away his lady admirers.

803
01:01:27,056 --> 01:01:29,224
Tell me about his wife.

804
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,893
Alicia.

805
01:01:31,894 --> 01:01:36,894
She moved to South Carolina
after Doc passed.

806
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,527
She passed
a couple years later.

807
01:01:40,528 --> 01:01:43,864
She always wore blue.

808
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:48,577
The shopkeepers in town
would stock blue hats

809
01:01:48,578 --> 01:01:53,578
because they knew if Doc
walked by, he'd buy one.

810
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:58,086
When they cleaned out
his office,

811
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:02,674
they found boxes of blue hats

812
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:06,052
that he never got around
to give her.

813
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:08,555
I'll bet you didn't know that.

814
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:13,556
No, I didn't.

815
01:02:13,603 --> 01:02:18,603
No screwing, no drinking, no
opium, no midnight abortions,

816
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:21,943
no illegitimate children,

817
01:02:21,944 --> 01:02:23,987
no shady finances.

818
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:27,157
You sound disappointed.

819
01:02:27,158 --> 01:02:31,036
Shoeless Joe had a problem.
That's why he needed you.

820
01:02:31,037 --> 01:02:32,829
This guy doesn't need us.

821
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:37,042
Terence.

822
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:42,043
Do you know you're missing?

823
01:02:43,633 --> 01:02:46,301
Oh, God.

824
01:02:46,302 --> 01:02:48,720
"His father,
who lives in Baltimore,"

825
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:52,682
"notified police after receiving no
answer to repeated telephone calls."

826
01:02:52,683 --> 01:02:54,809
Shoot

827
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,436
I better call him.

828
01:02:56,437 --> 01:02:58,188
You want me to...

829
01:02:58,189 --> 01:02:58,689
Thanks.

830
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:10,821
I'm taking a walk.
Be back in a while.

831
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:19,330
What do I tell him?

832
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:48,985
"This year's"?

833
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:32,111
Dr. Graham?

834
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:42,496
Dr. Graham?

835
01:04:43,252 --> 01:04:48,252
My name's Ray Kinsella.
I'm from Iowa.

836
01:04:49,216 --> 01:04:54,216
Are you "Moonlight" Graham?

837
01:04:56,015 --> 01:05:01,015
No one's called me "Moonlight"
Graham in 50 years.

838
01:05:01,896 --> 01:05:04,314
Well, I've come
a very long way to see you.

839
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:07,859
I couldn't sleep tonight.
Usually I sleep like a baby.

840
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:12,530
I told Alicia
I was taking a walk.

841
01:05:12,531 --> 01:05:14,783
Do you mind if I join you?

842
01:05:14,784 --> 01:05:17,327
I'd like to talk to you.

843
01:05:17,328 --> 01:05:21,331
Let's walk over to my office.

844
01:05:21,332 --> 01:05:23,541
What do you want
to talk to me about?

845
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:27,545
When you got to the majors, you
played only one inning of one game.

846
01:05:27,546 --> 01:05:30,507
What happened that inning?

847
01:05:30,508 --> 01:05:32,884
GRAHAM: It was the last day
of the season,

848
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:35,428
bottom of the eighth,
we were way ahead.

849
01:05:35,429 --> 01:05:39,808
In three weeks,
I hadn't seen any action.

850
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:43,269
Suddenly old John McGraw points
a bony finger in my direction

851
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:46,439
and he says, "Right field."

852
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,109
Ijumped up like I was sitting
on a spring,

853
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:54,110
grabbed my glove,
and ran out on the field.

854
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:58,034
RAY: Did you get to make
a play?

855
01:05:58,035 --> 01:06:02,455
They never hit the ball
out of the infield.

856
01:06:02,456 --> 01:06:05,792
The game ended.
The season was over.

857
01:06:05,793 --> 01:06:08,670
I knew they'd send me
back down.

858
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:12,090
I couldn't bear the thought
of another year in the minors.

859
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:17,091
So I decided to hang them up.

860
01:06:17,555 --> 01:06:18,805
Go on. Sit down.

861
01:06:18,806 --> 01:06:22,517
Thank you.

862
01:06:22,518 --> 01:06:26,521
So what was that like?

863
01:06:26,522 --> 01:06:29,983
Itwas like coming
this close to your dreams,

864
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:34,070
then watch them brush past you,
like a stranger in a crowd.

865
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:35,989
Then, you don't think about it.

866
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,867
We just don't recognize life's
most significant moments

867
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:40,076
while they're happening.

868
01:06:40,077 --> 01:06:43,872
Back then I thought, "Well,
there'll be other days."

869
01:06:43,873 --> 01:06:48,626
I didn't realize that
that was the only day.

870
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:52,755
And now,
I want to ask you a question.

871
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:57,218
What's so interesting about half an
inning that you'd come from Iowa

872
01:06:57,219 --> 01:07:01,806
to talk to me about it
50 years after it happened?

873
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:05,351
I didn't really know
till just now,

874
01:07:05,352 --> 01:07:09,647
but I think it's to ask you if you
could do anything you wanted,

875
01:07:09,648 --> 01:07:14,648
if you could have a wish...

876
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:20,533
And you're the kind of a man
who could grant me that wish?

877
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:24,746
I don't know. I'm just asking.

878
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:27,081
Well, you know,

879
01:07:27,082 --> 01:07:29,375
I never got to bat
in the major leagues.

880
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:32,587
I'd have liked to have had
that chance, just once,

881
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:34,923
to stare down
a big-league pitcher.

882
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:39,677
Then just as he goes
into his windup, wink.

883
01:07:39,678 --> 01:07:42,305
Make him think
you know something he doesn't.

884
01:07:42,306 --> 01:07:44,307
That's what I wish for.

885
01:07:44,308 --> 01:07:48,353
The chance to squint at a sky so blue
it hurts your eyes to look at it,

886
01:07:48,354 --> 01:07:51,272
to feel the tingle in your arms
as you connect with the ball,

887
01:07:51,273 --> 01:07:56,273
run bases, stretching a double into a
triple and flop face first into third,

888
01:07:56,612 --> 01:07:59,364
wrap your arms around the bag.

889
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:04,285
That's my wish. That's my wish.

890
01:08:04,286 --> 01:08:07,288
Is there enough magic
out there in the moonlight

891
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:09,874
to make this dream come true?

892
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,795
What would you say
if I said yes?

893
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:17,549
I think
I'd actually believe you.

894
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:20,051
There's a place where
things like that happen.

895
01:08:20,052 --> 01:08:25,052
If you want to go,
I can take you.

896
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:30,979
This is my most special place
in all the world.

897
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:35,980
Once a place touches you like this,
the wind never blows so cold again.

898
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:41,485
You feel for it,
like it was your child.

899
01:08:41,907 --> 01:08:44,492
I can't leave Chisholm.

900
01:08:44,493 --> 01:08:49,493
I understand. I do.

901
01:08:49,582 --> 01:08:54,168
But I really think you're
supposed to come with us.

902
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:54,669
No.

903
01:08:58,841 --> 01:09:01,384
But your wish?

904
01:09:01,385 --> 01:09:03,595
It'll have to stay a wish.

905
01:09:03,596 --> 01:09:08,596
I was born here, I lived here,
I'll die here, but no regrets.

906
01:09:09,018 --> 01:09:13,563
Fifty years ago, for 5 minutes
you came this close.

907
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:15,273
It would kill some men

908
01:09:15,274 --> 01:09:19,360
to get that close to their
dream and not touch it.

909
01:09:19,361 --> 01:09:21,362
God. They'd consider it
a tragedy.

910
01:09:21,363 --> 01:09:25,408
If I'd only gotten to be
a doctor for five minutes,

911
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:30,409
now that would have been
a tragedy.

912
01:09:31,582 --> 01:09:36,582
I better be getting home. Alicia
will think I got a girlfriend.

913
01:09:36,879 --> 01:09:40,548
<i>RA Y: And he smiled.</i>

914
01:09:40,549 --> 01:09:45,303
And then I figured, maybe we're
not supposed to take him with us.

915
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:48,723
I don't know.

916
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:51,851
I don't know why in the hell
we were supposed to come here.

917
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:56,564
Maybe it's to find out if one
inning can change the world.

918
01:09:56,565 --> 01:09:57,690
Think it did?

919
01:09:57,691 --> 01:09:59,525
Did for these people.

920
01:09:59,526 --> 01:10:03,738
If he'd gotten a hit, he might
have stayed in baseball.

921
01:10:03,739 --> 01:10:05,948
I don't know.

922
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:10,949
Oh, your wife called. She wants
you to call her tonight.

923
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:14,916
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

924
01:10:14,917 --> 01:10:17,669
Ray?

925
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:21,005
I'm fine.
I'm just so glad it's you.

926
01:10:21,006 --> 01:10:24,676
Listen, I talked to the bank,

927
01:10:24,677 --> 01:10:28,513
and I asked them if we could
miss a payment or two,

928
01:10:28,514 --> 01:10:32,767
and they told me that they had
just sold the note on the farm

929
01:10:32,768 --> 01:10:37,313
to Mark and his partners.

930
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:39,148
Right.
So they own the paper now.

931
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:43,611
He says if we don't sell to them,
they're going to foreclose.

932
01:10:43,612 --> 01:10:47,949
Ray, we don't have the money.

933
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:52,120
Look, I've got to take
Mr. Mann back to Boston first.

934
01:10:52,121 --> 01:10:53,162
Okay? So, it's...

935
01:10:53,163 --> 01:10:55,331
MANN: No.

936
01:10:55,332 --> 01:10:57,291
Wait a second.

937
01:10:57,292 --> 01:11:02,292
I'm going to Iowa with you.

938
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:07,756
We're coming home.

939
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:12,348
MANN: Hell, Ican't quit now.
I got to see this ballpark.

940
01:11:12,349 --> 01:11:15,810
RAY: Not everyone can see it.
You might not.

941
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:20,811
Give it a try.

942
01:11:23,777 --> 01:11:28,777
I need all the karma
I can get right now.

943
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:34,495
Thanks.
You're the first car by.

944
01:11:34,496 --> 01:11:35,621
How far you going?

945
01:11:35,622 --> 01:11:36,873
How far you going?

946
01:11:36,874 --> 01:11:38,332
Iowa.

947
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:43,333
If it's okay, I'll just ride along a while.
I play baseball.

948
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:49,256
Hop in. All right.

949
01:11:54,892 --> 01:11:56,601
I'm looking
for a place to play.

950
01:11:56,602 --> 01:12:00,563
I heard that all through the
Midwest, they have towns with teams.

951
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:03,858
In some places,
they'll find you a dayjob

952
01:12:03,859 --> 01:12:06,486
so you can play ball
nights and weekends.

953
01:12:06,487 --> 01:12:11,487
It's your lucky day. We're going
someplace kind of like that.

954
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,159
All right.

955
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,953
I'm Ray Kinsella.
This is Terence Mann.

956
01:12:15,954 --> 01:12:17,747
Hi.

957
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:22,748
I'm Archie Graham.

958
01:12:32,054 --> 01:12:35,556
It's funny the way he described
towns finding you a job

959
01:12:35,557 --> 01:12:38,142
so you could play
on their team.

960
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,520
They haven't done that
for years.

961
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:44,816
Dad did that for a while,
but that was in the '20s.

962
01:12:44,817 --> 01:12:47,068
What happened to your father?

963
01:12:47,069 --> 01:12:52,069
He never made it as a ballplayer. He
wanted his son to make it for him.

964
01:12:52,074 --> 01:12:57,074
By 10, playing baseball got to be like
eating vegetables or taking out garbage.

965
01:12:58,247 --> 01:13:02,416
When I was 14,
I started to refuse.

966
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:04,335
Can you believe that?

967
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:07,797
American boy refusing to have
a catch with his father?

968
01:13:07,798 --> 01:13:11,259
Why 14?

969
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,803
That's when I read The Boat
Rocker by Terence Mann.

970
01:13:13,804 --> 01:13:14,971
Oh, God.

971
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:16,931
I never played catch
with him again.

972
01:13:16,932 --> 01:13:19,684
That's the crap
people always lay on me.

973
01:13:19,685 --> 01:13:21,894
It's not my fault you wouldn't
play catch with him.

974
01:13:21,895 --> 01:13:22,395
I know.

975
01:13:26,108 --> 01:13:29,277
Anyway, when I was 17,

976
01:13:29,278 --> 01:13:33,573
I packed my things, said
something awful, andleñ.

977
01:13:33,574 --> 01:13:38,244
After a while, I wanted to come
home, but I didn't know how.

978
01:13:38,245 --> 01:13:43,245
Made it back
for the funeral, though.

979
01:13:51,258 --> 01:13:55,219
What was the awful thing
you said?

980
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,847
To your father?

981
01:13:57,848 --> 01:14:00,182
Oh.

982
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:05,183
I said I could never respect a
man whose hero was a criminal.

983
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:08,232
Who was his hero?

984
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:12,570
Shoeless Joe Jackson.

985
01:14:12,571 --> 01:14:15,406
You knew he wasn't a criminal.

986
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:18,701
Then why did you say it?

987
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:19,246
I was 17.

988
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:28,878
The son of a bitch died
before I could take it back.

989
01:14:28,879 --> 01:14:32,423
Before I could tell him,

990
01:14:32,424 --> 01:14:36,427
you know.

991
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:40,014
He never met my wife.

992
01:14:40,015 --> 01:14:44,185
He never saw his granddaughter.

993
01:14:44,186 --> 01:14:46,562
This is your penance.

994
01:14:46,563 --> 01:14:48,230
I know.

995
01:14:48,231 --> 01:14:50,316
I can't bring my father back.

996
01:14:50,317 --> 01:14:54,779
So the least you can do
is bring back his hero.

997
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:55,280
Well...

998
01:14:58,867 --> 01:15:03,412
Now I know what
everybody's purpose here is,

999
01:15:03,413 --> 01:15:08,413
except mine.

1000
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,420

to meet Shoeless Joe Jackson.

It's a pleasure meeting you.

The pleasure's mine.

1032
01:16:47,267 --> 01:16:50,770
We got tired
of just having practices,

1033
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:54,815
so we brought another team out
so we'd have some real games.

1034
01:16:54,816 --> 01:16:56,984
I don't mind.

1035

Where'd they come from?

1036
01:16:58,195 --> 01:16:59,904
Where did we come from?

1037
01:16:59,905 --> 01:17:04,283
So many wanted to play here. We had
to beat them off with a stick.

1038
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:06,827
Hey, that's Smokey Joe Wood

Ty Cobb wanted to play.

Nobody could stand him
when we were alive.

1043

MAN 2: What is this jerk doing?

1107
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:05,899
Hi!

1108
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,984
Shit!

1109
01:21:06,985 --> 01:21:08,110
Wreck him.

1110
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:09,236
MAN: Let me at him!

1111
01:21:09,237 --> 01:21:12,448
You're interrupting
the game, Mark.

1112
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:15,826
Ray, it's time to put away
your little fantasies

1113
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:17,119
and come down to Earth.

1114
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,496
It's not a fantasy.
They're real.

1115
01:21:19,497 --> 01:21:21,415
Who is real?

1116
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:24,918
Shoeless Joe Jackson,
the White Sox, all of them.

1117
01:21:24,919 --> 01:21:26,128
You mean?

1118
01:21:26,129 --> 01:21:28,922
He can't see any of them.

1119
01:21:28,923 --> 01:21:31,967
Well, who is this, Elvis?

1120
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:34,011
ANNIE: Ray.

1121
01:21:34,012 --> 01:21:36,305
As a matter of fact,
it's Terence Mann.

1122
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:38,724
How do you do?
I'm the Easter bunny.

1123
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:41,560
Let's settle this thing now.
You have no money.

1124
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:44,480
Look. I'm not selling.
You have no money!

1125
01:21:44,481 --> 01:21:48,859
You have a stack of bills! Come
fall, you got no crop to sell.

1126
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:52,446
I have a deal that allows you
to stay on the land.

1127
01:21:52,447 --> 01:21:55,949
We don't have to sell the farm.

1128
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:59,161
You'll live
in the house rent-free.

1129
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:00,621
What about the team?

1130
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:02,414
Do you realize
how much this land is worth?

1131
01:22:02,415 --> 01:22:06,043
Yeah. Yeah.

1132
01:22:06,044 --> 01:22:07,920
2,200 bucks an acre.

1133
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:12,299
We can't keep a useless baseball
diamond in rich farmland.

1134
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:15,302
Read my lips. We're staying, all right?
We're staying.

1135
01:22:15,303 --> 01:22:17,304
Ray, you're bankrupt!

1136
01:22:17,305 --> 01:22:20,140
I'm offering you a way to keep your
home because I love my sister.

1137
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:24,728
My partners don't care
and are ready to foreclose.

1138
01:22:24,729 --> 01:22:27,815
Daddy, we don't have
to sell the farm.

1139
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:29,316
Karin, please!

1140
01:22:29,317 --> 01:22:29,983
Just wait!

1141
01:22:29,984 --> 01:22:31,235
Just wait!

1142
01:22:31,236 --> 01:22:34,279
Wait!

1143
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,449
People will come.

1144
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:39,368
What people, sweetheart?

1145
01:22:39,369 --> 01:22:40,994
From all over.

1146
01:22:40,995 --> 01:22:43,997
They'll just decide
to take a Vacation, see?

1147
01:22:43,998 --> 01:22:46,500
And they'll come to Iowa City.

1148
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:50,879
They'll think it's really boring.
So they'll want to pay us.

1149
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,880
Like buying a ticket.

1150
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:58,846
You're not seriously listening
to this, are you?

1151
01:22:58,847 --> 01:23:00,848
Yes.

1152
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:02,433
Wait a minute.

1153
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:05,477
Why would anybody pay money
to come here?

1154
01:23:05,478 --> 01:23:07,521
To watch the games.

1155
01:23:07,522 --> 01:23:11,859
Itwill bejust like when they were
little kids a long time ago.

1156
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:15,612
They'll watch the game
and remember what it was like.

1157
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:18,115
What the hell
is she talking about?

1158
01:23:18,116 --> 01:23:19,533
People will come.

1159
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:22,369
All right. This is fascinating,

1160
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:25,873
but you don't have the money to
bring the mortgage up to date.

1161
01:23:25,874 --> 01:23:29,376
You're still going
to have to sell.

1162
01:23:29,377 --> 01:23:31,378
I'm sorry, Ray.

1163
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:36,008
We got no choice.

1164
01:23:36,009 --> 01:23:37,718
MANN: Ray.

1165
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:42,055
People will come, Ray.

1166
01:23:42,056 --> 01:23:46,226
They'll come to Iowa for reasons
they can't even fathom.

1167
01:23:46,227 --> 01:23:50,647
They'll turn up your driveway, not
knowing for sure why they're doing it.

1168
01:23:50,648 --> 01:23:52,149
They'll arrive at your door

1169
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:56,612
as innocent as children,
longing for the past.

1170
01:23:56,613 --> 01:24:01,283
"Of course, we won't mind
if you look around," youWisay.

1171
01:24:01,284 --> 01:24:03,827
"It's only $20 per person."

1172
01:24:03,828 --> 01:24:07,080
They'll pass over the money
without even thinking about it.

1173
01:24:07,081 --> 01:24:10,417
For it is money they have
and peace they lack.

1174
01:24:10,418 --> 01:24:13,420
Just sign the papers.

1175
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:17,466
MANN: Then they'll walk out
to the bleachers

1176
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:22,467
and sit in their shirt sleeves
on a perfect afternoon.

1177
01:24:23,431 --> 01:24:26,683
They'll find
they have reserved seats

1178
01:24:26,684 --> 01:24:29,895
somewhere along
one of the baselines,

1179
01:24:29,896 --> 01:24:32,272
where they sat
when they were children

1180
01:24:32,273 --> 01:24:34,900
and cheered their heroes,

1181
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:37,110
and they'll watch the game,

1182
01:24:37,111 --> 01:24:41,532
and itwill be as if they dipped
themselves in magic waters.

1183
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:43,951
The memories will be so thick,

1184
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:47,079
they'll have to brush them
away from their faces.

1185
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,375
Ray, when the bank opens in the
morning, they'll foreclose.

1186
01:24:51,376 --> 01:24:53,293
People will come, Ray.

1187
01:24:53,294 --> 01:24:57,965
You're broke, Ray. You sell
now, or you lose everything.

1188
01:24:57,966 --> 01:25:02,966
The one constant through all the
years, Ray, has been baseball.

1189
01:25:03,012 --> 01:25:06,807
America has rolled by
like an army of steamrollers.

1190
01:25:06,808 --> 01:25:11,808
It's been erased like a blackboard,
rebuilt, and erased again.

1191
01:25:12,146 --> 01:25:17,109
But baseball has marked
the time.

1192
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:20,487
This field, this game.

1193
01:25:20,488 --> 01:25:23,532
It's a part of our past, Ray.

1194
01:25:23,533 --> 01:25:27,995
It reminds us of all
that once was good,

1195
01:25:27,996 --> 01:25:31,039
and it could be again.

1196
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:36,040
Oh, people will come, Ray.

1197
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:39,464
People will
most definitely come.

1198
01:25:39,465 --> 01:25:43,010
MARK: Ray,
you will lose everything.

1199
01:25:43,011 --> 01:25:48,011
You will be evicted.

1200
01:25:55,940 --> 01:26:00,940
Come on, Ray.

1201
01:26:18,588 --> 01:26:20,213
I'm not signing.

1202
01:26:20,214 --> 01:26:23,175
You're crazy. Absolutely nuts!

1203
01:26:23,176 --> 01:26:24,468
I can't do it, pal.

1204
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:26,637
I mean,
you build a baseball field

1205
01:26:26,638 --> 01:26:28,347
I mean,
you build a baseball field

1206
01:26:28,348 --> 01:26:31,516
in the middle of nowhere,
and you stare at nothing.

1207
01:26:31,517 --> 01:26:34,561
It's not nothing. Your daughter's
turned into a space case.

1208
01:26:34,562 --> 01:26:38,023
Get your hands off her!

1209
01:26:38,024 --> 01:26:43,024
ANNIE: Karin?

1210
01:26:44,572 --> 01:26:47,157
ANNIE: Is she all right?
Is she breathing?

1211
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:52,158
MANN: Should I get the car?

1212
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:57,584
I'm going to call Emergency.

1213
01:26:57,585 --> 01:26:59,586
Annie, wait.

1214
01:26:59,587 --> 01:27:00,087
What?

1215
01:27:18,064 --> 01:27:23,064
Just wait.

1216
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:39,459
What have we got here?

1217
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,072
She fell.

1218
01:27:48,469 --> 01:27:51,805
GRAHAM: This child's choking
to death. Get her up.

1219
01:27:51,806 --> 01:27:54,391
Hold her steady now.

1220
01:27:54,392 --> 01:27:59,392
(KARIN COUGHING)

1221
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:02,941
Hot dog. Stuck in her throat.

1222
01:28:02,942 --> 01:28:04,568
She'll be all right.

1223
01:28:04,569 --> 01:28:09,569
She'll be turning handsprings
before you know it.

1224
01:28:11,868 --> 01:28:14,786
Thank you, Doc.

1225
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:16,663
No, son.

1226
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:20,834
Thank you.

1227
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:23,336
Oh, my God. You can't go back.

1228
01:28:23,337 --> 01:28:25,130
Hey, it's all right.

1229
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:30,131
I'm sorry. It's all right.

1230
01:28:32,054 --> 01:28:34,514
I best be getting on home

1231
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:39,515
before Alicia begins to think
I got a girlfriend.

1232
01:28:43,024 --> 01:28:44,941
Hey, D0c.

1233
01:28:44,942 --> 01:28:48,445
Good work, Doc.

1234
01:28:48,446 --> 01:28:53,033
Nice going, Doc.

1235
01:28:53,034 --> 01:28:57,037
Going to miss you, Doc.

1236
01:28:57,038 --> 01:28:59,664
Win one for me one day,
will you, boys?

1237
01:28:59,665 --> 01:29:01,041
Okay, Doc.

1238
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:01,542
Yeah.

1239
01:29:09,383 --> 01:29:14,383
When did these ballplayers
get here?

1240
01:29:17,683 --> 01:29:22,683
JOE: Hey, rookie!

1241
01:29:30,822 --> 01:29:35,822
You were good.

1242
01:29:46,504 --> 01:29:50,590
Do not sell this farm, Ray.
You got to keep this farm.

1243
01:29:50,591 --> 01:29:54,970
You've had a rough day. Go inside
and get something cold to drink.

1244
01:29:54,971 --> 01:29:58,974
Yeah. That's a good idea.

1245
01:29:58,975 --> 01:30:03,975
Don't sell the farm, Ray.

1246
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:12,279
Ray?

1247
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,406
We're going to call it a day.

1248
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:16,032
See you tomorrow.

1249
01:30:16,033 --> 01:30:16,533
Okay.

1250
01:30:21,539 --> 01:30:26,539
Hey, do you want
to come with us?

1251
01:30:27,795 --> 01:30:29,462
You mean it?

1252
01:30:29,463 --> 01:30:32,007
No, not you.

1253
01:30:32,008 --> 01:30:32,508
Him.

1254
01:30:36,637 --> 01:30:38,805
Him? Come with you?

1255
01:30:38,806 --> 01:30:39,973
JOE: Out there.

1256
01:30:39,974 --> 01:30:41,308
What is out there?

1257
01:30:41,309 --> 01:30:42,726
Come and find out.

1258
01:30:42,727 --> 01:30:44,519
Wait a second. Why him?

1259
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,980
I built this field. You wouldn't
be here if it weren't for me.

1260
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:48,899
Ray, I'm unattached.
You have a family.

1261
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:52,819
I want to know
what's out there.

1262
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:56,656
But you're not invited.

1263
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:59,701
Not invited? What do you mean
I'm not invited?

1264
01:30:59,702 --> 01:31:03,038
That's my corn out there. You
guys are guests in my corn.

1265
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:05,165
I've done everything
I've been asked to do.

1266
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:07,500
I didn't understand it,
but I've done it.

1267
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:09,502
I haven't once asked
what's in it for me.

1268
01:31:09,503 --> 01:31:10,670
What are you saying?

1269
01:31:10,671 --> 01:31:14,382
I'm saying,
"What's in it for me?"

1270
01:31:14,383 --> 01:31:16,551
Is that why you did this?

1271
01:31:16,552 --> 01:31:17,052
Foryou?

1272
01:31:22,808 --> 01:31:27,808
I think you'd better
stay here, Ray.

1273
01:31:28,856 --> 01:31:31,775
Why?

1274
01:31:31,776 --> 01:31:34,861
There's a reason they chose me,

1275
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:38,865
just as there's a reason
they chose this field.

1276
01:31:38,866 --> 01:31:40,700
MANN: I gave that interview.

1277
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,827
What interview?
What are you talking about?

1278
01:31:42,828 --> 01:31:47,828
The one about Ebbets Field, the one
that sent you to Boston to find me.

1279
01:31:50,002 --> 01:31:51,670
You lied to me.

1280
01:31:51,671 --> 01:31:54,714
You were kidnapping me at the time.
You lied.

1281
01:31:54,715 --> 01:31:59,344
You said your finger was a gun.

1282
01:31:59,345 --> 01:32:01,137
That's a good point.

1283
01:32:01,138 --> 01:32:04,724
Ray.

1284
01:32:04,725 --> 01:32:07,394
Ray.

1285
01:32:07,395 --> 01:32:11,564
Listen to me, Ray.
Listen to me.

1286
01:32:11,565 --> 01:32:14,401
There is something out there,

1287
01:32:14,402 --> 01:32:17,404
and if I have the courage
to go through with this,

1288
01:32:17,405 --> 01:32:21,241
what a story it'll make.

1289
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:26,242
"Shoeless Joe Jackson comes
to Iowa."

1290
01:32:33,045 --> 01:32:34,754
What? Are you going
to write about it?

1291
01:32:34,755 --> 01:32:36,965
You bet I'll write about it.

1292
01:32:36,966 --> 01:32:39,759
You're going to write about it.

1293
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,760
That's what I do.

1294
01:32:45,516 --> 01:32:46,016
Good.

1295
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:50,521
Good.

1296
01:33:01,365 --> 01:33:06,365
ANNIE: Honey?

1297
01:33:06,912 --> 01:33:09,622
Honey, where's he going?

1298
01:33:09,623 --> 01:33:12,292
Terry's been invited
to go out with the others.

1299
01:33:12,293 --> 01:33:14,252
How are you feeling,
sweetheart?

1300
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:15,628
Stupid.

1301
01:33:15,629 --> 01:33:16,921
You mean out?

1302
01:33:16,922 --> 01:33:19,174
Yeah.

1303
01:33:19,175 --> 01:33:21,051
Out.

1304
01:33:21,052 --> 01:33:24,512
ANNIE: Far out.

1305
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:27,057
I want a full description.

1306
01:33:27,058 --> 01:33:31,644
Take care of this family.

1307
01:33:31,645 --> 01:33:36,645
ANNIE: Be careful.

1308
01:34:32,206 --> 01:34:32,706
Bye.

1309
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,044
What?

1310
01:34:44,885 --> 01:34:47,762
What are you grinning at,
you ghost?

1311
01:34:47,763 --> 01:34:51,808
"If you build it,"

1312
01:34:51,809 --> 01:34:56,809
"he will come."

1313
01:35:05,406 --> 01:35:07,490
Oh, my God.

1314
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:12,491
What? What is it?

1315
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:18,080
It's my father.

1316
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,881
"Ease his pain."

1317
01:35:22,882 --> 01:35:27,719
ANNIE: "Go the distance."

1318
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:32,720
RAY: It was you.

1319
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:34,851
No, Ray.

1320
01:35:34,852 --> 01:35:39,852
It was you.

1321
01:36:02,713 --> 01:36:05,340
RAY: My God. I...

1322
01:36:05,341 --> 01:36:10,341
I only saw him years later
when he was worn down by life.

1323
01:36:10,846 --> 01:36:14,140
Look at him.

1324
01:36:14,141 --> 01:36:19,141
He's got his whole life in front of him,
and I'm not even a glint in his eye.

1325
01:36:23,484 --> 01:36:27,362
What do I say to him?

1326
01:36:27,363 --> 01:36:32,363
ANNIE: Why don't you introduce
him to his granddaughter?

1327
01:36:33,702 --> 01:36:36,162
JOHN: Hi.

1328
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:37,747
Hi.

1329
01:36:37,748 --> 01:36:41,084
I just wanted to thank you folks
for putting up this field,

1330
01:36:41,085 --> 01:36:43,544
letting us play here.

1331
01:36:43,545 --> 01:36:47,340
I'm John Kinsella.

1332
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:50,176
I'm Ray.

1333
01:36:50,177 --> 01:36:52,887
My wife Annie. Hi.

1334
01:36:52,888 --> 01:36:54,806
This is my daughter Karin.

1335
01:36:54,807 --> 01:36:59,519
Karin, this is my...

1336
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,063
This is John.

1337
01:37:02,064 --> 01:37:05,775
KARIN: Hi, John.

1338
01:37:05,776 --> 01:37:09,821
Hiya, Karin.

1339
01:37:09,822 --> 01:37:14,158
Well, we're going to let
you two talk.

1340
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:15,952
I mean, if all these people
are going to come,

1341
01:37:15,953 --> 01:37:20,290
we got a lot of work to do.

1342
01:37:20,291 --> 01:37:23,626
It was very nice meeting you.

1343
01:37:23,627 --> 01:37:26,129
Ma'am.

1344
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:31,130
Come on, hon.

1345
01:37:42,354 --> 01:37:45,481
You catch a good game.

1346
01:37:45,482 --> 01:37:49,152
Thank you.

1347
01:37:49,153 --> 01:37:53,239
It's so beautiful here.

1348
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,784
For me...

1349
01:37:56,785 --> 01:38:01,785
Well, for me it's like
a dream come true.

1350
01:38:03,417 --> 01:38:08,417
Can I ask you something?

1351
01:38:09,089 --> 01:38:14,089
Is... Is this heaven?

1352
01:38:15,304 --> 01:38:18,639
It's Iowa.

1353
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,558
Iowa?

1354
01:38:20,559 --> 01:38:21,059
Yeah.

1355
01:38:24,897 --> 01:38:29,897
I could have sworn
it was heaven.

1356
01:38:35,616 --> 01:38:37,700
Is...

1357
01:38:37,701 --> 01:38:41,537
Is there a heaven?

1358
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:44,791
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:49,792
It's the place
dreams come true.

1360
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:12,189
Maybe this is heaven.

1361
01:39:13,987 --> 01:39:15,947
Well...

1362
01:39:15,948 --> 01:39:19,992
Good night, Ray.

1363
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:24,993
Good night, John.

1364
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:36,880
RAY: Hey, Dad?

1365
01:39:37,636 --> 01:39:42,098
You want to have a catch?

1366
01:39:42,099 --> 01:39:47,099
I'd like that.
