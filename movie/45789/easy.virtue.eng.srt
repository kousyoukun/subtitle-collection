673
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,436
Hilda, if I had any inkling that yOu

YOu cOuld have made an effOrt

677
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,438
- Technically, I have One.
- But yOu've had tWO.

678
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,915
I've had tWO ShOeS

Oh, I'm Sure MariOn

683
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,273
Of Watching a IOved One
Slip thrOugh her fingerS.

684
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,311
She'S ScandalOuS!

685
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,353
YOu ShOuld hear What they're Saying
abOut her in the village.

686

Well, let'S StOp the Wagging tOngueS,

IS it true yOu've had

688
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,512
Of cOurSe it'S nOt true, MrS Whittaker.

689
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,473
Hardly any Of them actually IOved me.

690
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,112
That WaS uncalled fOr.
I realiSe it WaS a jOke, but Still...

691
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,233

- MariOn hardly cOnStituteS WOlveS.

692
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,239
All right, yOu threW me tO the vOleS.
Either Way, yOu abandOned me.

693
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,555
YOur SiSterS need tO be reStrained.

694
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,878
ReStrained? Hilda breakS IOOSe Once

703
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,559
ESpecially Since it iSn't WOrking.

704
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,870
What the devil haS that dOg dug up?

HOW cOuld yOu nOt tell uS?

MariOn, it WaS an accident.
I am Walking On eggShellS here.

709
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,717
And I believe I panicked.
And Once again, I'm very, very SOrry.

JuSt fOrget the Seven

993
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,155
WhO have devOted their entire liveS

994
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,317
Get SOmeOne elSe tO dO it.
With a machine, nO leSS.

995
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,311
WhO dO yOu think yOu are?

996
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,109
SWinging yOur WhereWithal
like a cat On heat.

997
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,876
If yOu really Want tO be
Of aSSiStance, Larita,

998
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,468
I think yOu knOW What'S required.

999
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,476
Right...

1000
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,275
I think it'S time an eXpert ShOWed yOu

BravO!

1003
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,988

1004
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,071
(JOhn) 'Lari, yOu're cOnfuSing me.'

1005
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,078
- (Lari) 'I'm feeling trapped.'
- 'I dOn't underStand.'

1006
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,237
Lt'S thiS hOuSe!
It haS an air Of dOOm hanging Over it.

1007
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,352
And I can barely Stand the Weight

1008

The anSWer iS tO gO abrOad again.

1011
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,113

1012
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,310
(JOhn laughS)

1013
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,077
What iS the uSe Of bickering like thiS?
It dOeSn't lead anywhere.

1014
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,033
YOu never knOW.
It might lead tO a natural end.

1015
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,636
DO yOu Want it tO?

1016
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,870
DO yOu?

1017
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,399
NO!

1018
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,192
I juSt Want SOme peace and quiet.

1019
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,993
(Larita) YOu're far tOO yOung
tO make a remark like that.

1020
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,111
I can't help my age...

1021
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,191
...Grandma.

1022
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,273
LOOk, I'm SOrry that I leave yOu alOne

1024
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,555
Why are We driving SO faSt?

1025
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,671
The thrill Of eScape!

1026
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,597
(Laughter)

1027
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,676
(HurSt) YOu're IOOking very game tOday.
FaireSt game in the land.

1028
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,752
A penny fOr yOur thOughtS?

1029
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,474
Lt'S mOre than pennieS,
I'm afraid, Pinkie.

1030
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,955
I dOn't think I can affOrd the party
thiS year.

1031
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,594
- But the JapaneSe lanternS!
- NO, cancelled.

1032
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,473
Had tO chOOSe,
JapaneSe lanternS Or the maid.

1033
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,628
YOu're nOt getting Out Of it that eaSily.
My Offer Of cellar and Staff Still StandS.

1034
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,150
It WOuldn't be ChriStmaS

1035
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,429

01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,117
(She SighS heavily)

1037
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:15,519
Oh! ThiS iS the firSt piece Of clarity
I've had Since arriving. WhOO!

1038
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,515
Why can't We live in mOmentS

1039
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,437
Why?

1040
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,791
BecauSe yOu've StOpped

HOW can yOu Say that?

Oh, I juSt Open my mOuth

1043
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,876
Then let'S make a freSh Start.

1044
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,350
There are SO many thingS I need
tO tell yOu abOut me. Hard thingS.

1045
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,198

01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,117

It dOeSn't matter.
I truSt yOu abSOlutely.

1048
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:13,118
# I'll See yOu again

# Time may lie heavy betWeen

1051
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:26,833
# But What haS been

# ThiS SWeet memOry

# ThOugh the WOrld may gO aWry... #

1055
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,114
(Man) ShOt!

1056
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,390
(Barking)

1057
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,239
(ScreamS)

1058
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,032
(Laughing)

1059
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,279
(GaSpS) JOhn!

1060
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,673
(DOg SnarlS)

1061
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,997
- TOp hOle.
- Oh!

1062
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,237
(Jim) I can't decide Which iS WOrSe,
that yOu had tO Sneak OutSide

1063
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,033
tO get SOme privacy,
Or that yOu Were caught by VerOnica.

1064
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,912
(Larita) WhO'S VerOnica?

1065
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,190
I am. It'S my name.

1066
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,799
(Jim chuckleS)

1067
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,596
- I fail tO See the humOur in it!
- NO, darling, yOu're quite right.

1068
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,951
I can certainly See the SeriOuS
implicatiOnS. It'S nOt a laughing matter.

1069
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,877
It'S Only a laughing matter.

1070
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,709
Indecent eXpOSure iS illegal.
Even in America.

1071
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,831
Yep, yep...

1072
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,428
YOu're right.
And We're very, very SOrry, aren't We?

1073
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,678
- NO, I'm nOt. ThiS iS my huSband.
- And thiS iS my hOme!

1074
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,189
(Jim) Maybe it'S time fOr them
tO fly the neSt?

1075
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,029
Certainly nOt. They Will Stay put
and brazen thiS Out.

1076
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,038
And yOu can get that ghaStly painting
Out Of my hOuSe!

1077
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,913
We dO nOt need any mOre reminderS
Of yOur eaSy virtue!

1078
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,159
(SighS heavily)

1079
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,234
- EXcited, Furber?
- Overwhelmed, Sir.

1080
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:05,751
- MiSS Hilda...

1081
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,474
Furber, I recOgniSe that aS aSparaguS.

1082
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,397
(Furber) COrrect, Madam.

1083
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,956
- Ha! I pity pOOr Panda.
- Oh, What iS it nOW?

1084
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,029
Read! "The DetrOit NeWS".
Uncle GeOrge iS a Super Sleuth!

1085
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,436
COllecting Old neWSpaperS iS
the laSt refuge Of a truly bOring man.

1086
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,519
BOring? Far frOm it. It WaS a Scandal!

1087
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,234
WaSn't it... MrS MOrley?

1088
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,472
MrS TOm MOrley Of DetrOit, Michigan.

1089
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,716
(Jim) DOn't be grOteSque, Hilda.

1090
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,152
Well, I SuppOSe I'd better finiSh

1092
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,309

- We've been hOOdWinked!

1093
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,749
- ESpecially that runny vinaigrette.
- (MariOn) Fire and brimStOne!

1094
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,757
MayOnnaiSe haS mOre ballaSt.

Will yOu StOp thiS inSulting behaviOur

1096
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,676
Oh, I alWayS hated that phOtO Of mySelf.

1097
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,713
(MrS Whittaker) Of everything I ever

1098
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,400
- (Jim) FOr What?

1099
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,909
- I WaS acquitted.

1100
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,350

1101
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,391
DOeS JOhn knOW abOut thiS?

Father! Really!

1104
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,273
YeS, and after Hilda Went

1105

I'm gOing OutSide fOr a cigarette.

1107
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,998
NO cOncern?

1108
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,111
(Jim) The pack'S clOSing.

1109
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,277
ThiS WOman haS taken advantage
Of Our SOn!

1110
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,356
He'd never have married her
if he'd knOWn.

1111
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,233
- YOu knOW that, dO yOu?
- YOu'd have preferred We had an affair?

1112
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,318
- It WOuld've been mOre apprOpriate!
- MOther!

1113
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,353
- UnfOrtunately, I agree With yOu!
- (MariOn) lt'S eaSy tO talk like thiS nOW.

1114
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,393
It iSn't eaSy, it'S heartbreaking.
I IOve JOhn, but it'S nOt blind IOve.

1115
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,714
(MariOn SnOrtS)

1116
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,673
MariOn, dOeS that SOund
indicate cOntempt Or aSthma?

1117
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,030
YOu can't palm uS Off like that,
MrS MOrley.

1118
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,151
(Jim) ThiS iS yOur dOing.
YOu're a bigger fOOI than yOu IOOk.

1119
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,271
(Hilda) Larita iS yOur type,
iSn't She, Father?

1120
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,834
(Larita) That iS the niceSt thing
any Of yOu have ever Said.

1121
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,394
(JOhn) HellO, are We having a picnic?

1122
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,438
JOhn... I think yOur Wife better unveil
thiS One herSelf. DOn't yOu, Larita?

1123
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,479
BefOre We met...

1124
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,479
...I WaS invOlved in a cOurt caSe
Over the death Of my huSband.

1125
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,830
It WaS Seedy and StreSSful,

1126
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,758
but Since I WaS fOund innOcent

1127
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,872
I didn't think it neceSSary
tO burden yOu With the detailS.

1128
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,228
InnOcent?

1129
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,158
She WaS reSpOnSible
fOr a man killing himSelf!

1130
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,750
The verdict WaS Suicide
but that'S nOt Where it Started.

1131
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,598
I thOught it WaS cancer.

1132
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,798
